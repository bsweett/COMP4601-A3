After reading the reviews here, I thought the 2 main male characters would be dislikable, but I didn't get that at all.  I felt terrible for them and was AMAZED at the ending.  See it.  You won't forget it for a while.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>Wow... I didn't expect "Hostel" to be so vicious. I can't recall any American director making such violent and brutal movies as this one.<br /><br />Three friends who travel in Europe looking for some good time (sex, drugs & rock'n'roll), finally find themselves in a little Slovakian town, in a hostel where everything seems to fit their idea of heaven on Earth. And as it's easy to imagine, soon this heaven turns into hell or even worse.<br /><br />And so "Hostel" starting as an average teenage sex-comedy, closer to its second half turns into a bloody mess. But not that stupid teen slasher bloody mess - I mean real sick and horrid bloody mess.<br /><br />Directors used to fight for appropriate ratings for their films lately, hence we don't get to see pictures that are SO gory very often. Eli Roth obviously doesn't care about ratings, so "Hostel" turned out to be everything a true horror fan can only dream of. His film is full of gore, severed limbs, sweat and vomit. Believe me, for a long time we haven't seen such a brutal, twisted and in-your-face picture as Eli Roth's "Hostel". But it's far from being perfect though. It's extremely disturbing and nauseous, as a horror fan I liked it a lot, but there's still something missing. Some characters' development maybe, some sense... It seemed that trying to shock the audience, the makers of the film forgot why they'd decided to make it in the first place. But it's just the second big movie of Roth, he's young and very talented, I'm sure he'll give the fans hell in the nearest future.<br /><br />Interesting observation - I just watched "Hostel" in theater, and after the film people were lowering their eyes as if they were ashamed they were watching it. That's what I call a good horror movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>I bought the Hostel 2 dvd after watching Hostel 1 several times on cable.  Despite his youthfulness, Eli Roth really delivered, he put the audience in the shoes of the Nazi targets. He's making Holocaust movies which is why Germany deleted the scene with the gypsy kids in Hostel 2.  Eli Roth is WHY Michael Haneke made Funny Games!!! Ho, ho, ho, Green Giant. I really do HEART Eli Roth.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>This isn't a great film and certainly doesn't live up to the hype that surrounded it (although that was mostly self-publicity). Yes there are some horrible moments but after a while you become immune to the blood and guts and really don't care about the characters. Hitchcock showed us more than fifty years ago that if you want to be frightened don't show the viewer whats behind the door. This gets a few marks purely on a gore level but for most of the time its a remarkably souless venture.<br /><br />The basic premise of the film is that there are rich people in eastern europe who pay for the pleasure of torturing people. The victims are lured by sex and thats it really. You get the inevitable soft-core for the lads and not much else. If you see it once you probably wont ever want to see it again. So I would rent it rather than purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>This is quite a movie folks.  The story is good,  we have 3 travelling lads<br /><br />looking for a good time/sex as most males like to do, but they kind of end<br /><br />up in places they did'nt expect.  The acting is good, the girls are nice<br /><br />and it never gets boring.  The sets and atmosphere are pretty creepy and<br /><br />mixed with the right music.  This is 2007 and now movies will show most<br /><br />gross special effects compared to a decade or two ago. So what we have is<br /><br />is very well done effects that adds to the movie and will probably make<br /><br />your stomach turn a bit.... We have to remember this is only a movie, but<br /><br />in a world where rich people pay for snuff films and other sick things this<br /><br />scenario (i hope not) could or may be happening somewhere ...</p></br><a href="../users/A24KZBAAUTC83R.html">A24KZBAAUTC83R</a><br/><p>Although he may not have directed this one, Quentin Tarantino's flavorings is all over this horror movie.<br /><br />After all that I had heard about this film's torture sequences, I didn't think there was that much. I really thought they were gonna show more than they did.<br /><br />A notch above the average teen slasher flick, HOSTEL titillates viewers with sex, drugs, and extreme torture. This was way better than this director's first movie, which to me, was quite boring and forgettable. Not so for HOSTEL.<br /><br />I wonder what is in store for us with HOSTEL 2...?</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Certain films just scream a purchase to me, even blind buys. The Fly and Dr Strangelove were pure blind buys and I didn't regret them. Sometimes though a film comes out and you just have to test the waters. Well going to the video store, I found out I got a free rental so I was very curious about Hostel so got that. Well, that saying of "I want those 90 minutes back" certainly applied to me. "Scariest movie in a decade"? Liars.<br /><br />2 Americans and a Icelandic friend are in England backpacking looking for, what else? Women, particularly soon-to-be naked willing women. They overhear a story of a place that has incredibly easy girls who just love American accents. Well getting there, they meet 2 girls and soon they get suckered in to an odd place: people who pay to torture and kill people for a price, and wouldn't you know it? Americans fetch a mighty fine price.<br /><br />Like Land of the Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, the Saw films and Wolf Creek, the film tries to horrify by showing disgusting images such as severed limbs or any other nasty business. Hostel doesn't delve into it right away but there's still a kind of pointless feel to it all. When the carnage starts happening, I can just imagine the filmmakers going nuts because they just wanted to make a violent movie. Gore can be used in a more artistic fashion such as war films but here it just feels violent just for the sake of it.<br /><br />What piqued my interest was this guy at the college mentioned the film and one of the gory shots and a woman in the class said "every guy his age should see that film". Whether she meant it as "boys will be boys" who will see those nudity/violence filled movies or it shows commentary on a thing apparently guys love to do: go overseas and bed "hot European chicks". To be honest, I never was into that, preferring the romance and chase angle but this is a commentary and it's a well-told one at that, it's just too bad it's on a ridiculous and pointless movie.<br /><br />If you want good horror movies, check out the Exorcist or the Shining or Carrie but if you're into gory stuff, you'll love it. Me? I want my free rental back.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>In 2002 or 2003, I forget which, Eli Roth gave us "Cabin Fever" his first film.<br /><br />I liked it, but have yet to meet a single person who also liked it. Critics hated it, the people on Amazon hate it. But, after seeing the preview for this movie during "Saw II" I thought it looked pretty good. Oh, and Quentin Tarantino is the Executive Producer. Basically all Tarantino did was sign on as Executive Producer, so they could put his name on their posters, and he picked up his paycheck. The thing is, Tarantino isn't one of those directors who sells out and does whatever he can for money. Tarantino liked this script or he wouldn't have had anything to do with it. I'm not saying that's a reason to see it, after all he liked "Wolf Creek" which I hated, so...But, horror fans should see this movie. Eli Roth still has a long way to go before making a quote "good movie", but Roth does know how to structure and execute a horror film. He's clearly inspired by early horror films, because this movie has exactly what those did. Lots of gore, lots of violence, lots of language, and LOTS OF NUDITY! In fact, the latter is pretty much what the entire plot of the film revolves around. The movie stars Jay Hernandez (Crazy/Beautiful) and Derek Richardson (Dumb & Dumberer) as two American college students named Paxton and Josh. Traveling with their Icelandic friend Oli (Eythor Godjonsson, who's really funny) the trio travel through Europe with the sole goal of getting laid and smoking pot. In one city, they come close (Paxton & Oli score, but Josh doesn't) and when they're kicked out of their hostel (the european named for hotel) they meet up with a creepy looking guy named Alex who tells them of beautiful women willing to do anything. All they have to do is travel to Slovakia. So, naturally they do and exactly what Alex promises them comes into focus. But, the next morning Oli is missing. So, as Paxton and Josh look for him they end up somewhere they didn't expect to end up...Which, if you've seen the previews is obviously a torture chamber. There's a "twist" at the end of the movie which you're given enough clues to figure out early on, but I didn't.<br /><br />A lot of people write about this, which in my opinion can actually ruin the effect the end product has. But, anyways, Roth has obviously improved over "Cabin Fever". He's been compared to Rob Zombie, who's first film "House of 1000 Corpses" was recieved about as well as "Cabin Fever". And who's second film "The Devil's Rejects" got good reviews and was actually one of Quentin Tarantino's favorite movies of 2005. Well, Roth isn't better than Zombie. But, I do respect Roth for what he tries to do. He tries to entertain us, gross us out, make us flinch, and make us laugh. And he actually succeeds at all of them. Sure, not all the characters are that smart and, like all horror films, their are decisions that could be made early on in the film and save the characters life, but this is a good horror movie. It's better than "Wolf Creek" by quite a margin and while some recent horror films easily surpass it (The "Saw" series, anyone?) it's still a really good for hardcore horror fans.<br /><br />GRADE: B+</p></br><a href="../users/AO4J90YPX5RU6.html">AO4J90YPX5RU6</a><br/><p>Hostel starts off rather slow posing as a dark sex comedy with random laughs and plenty of t&a (breast and rear nudity) ..as three men venture to another country on vacation, their want(s) for casual sex lead them to a strange and macabre part of the world that most movie goers hope doesnt really exsist. As the plot progressed i realized that a bloodbath was around the corner. The film soon reveals that it is about human torture and the price some insane people will pay to be givin the opportunity to torture and kill a foreigner. As I watched the movie I glanced next to me at the elderly woman to my right, she appeared to be disgusted by the film and its harsh sexual dialogue, nudity and graphic gory violent content. I tell you this because i don't recommend the film to senior citizens and children whom i saw plenty of in the theater today.. However, I do recommend it to adult horror fans that love a gross good time at the movies!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Hostel can best be described like this- the first half of it focuses around nothing but sexual acts involving young college boys in Belgium attempting to score with the very attractive near-supermodel quality women that roam the streets over there (and boy are they ever hot!) and the second half is when the actual horror finally gets underway so we witness some gruesome cutting and chopping involving knives, chainsaws, and sharp blades.<br /><br />Some of the horror is especially disturbing in a mentally screwed up kind of way, especially near the end when the Asian girl gets her eyeball ripped off and yellow mustard drips down her socket.  Later on she realizes while seeing her reflection that she can't go on living in such a way so she then immediately jumps in front of a train and kills herself, shocking all the concerned people around her.<br /><br />The problem is that the first half is so focused on everything *except* horror that it might not be worth the wait for the actual suspense and horror to develop.  It's supposed to be about a twisted man who captures and butchers young people but... the storyline mainly sticks with the college kids and avoids any kind of compelling storytelling.  I admit it was sort of cool how the captured kids would scream and scream and yet, no compassion on the part of the killer would occur.  Oh, and without spoiling the ending, the gruesome, bloody scenes that take place then happen to be exceptionally low budget.  Not sure if others would agree.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad horror flick by any means, and I admit that because the women were so attractive I didn't mind the first half of the film at all, but those looking strictly for horror will be disappointed with the lengthy waiting period.</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>When I saw the movie at the flea market for a buck, I said, "What the heck, it's Tarantino." I had trouble following the movie due to a lack of confusing flashbacks (It's a joke.)<br /><br />Three guys are touring Europe doing guy things. They meet a man who tells them about a Hostel in a small isolated town in Eastern Europe where there is an overabundance of pretty women who have nothing better to do than to throw themselves at anyone with a foreign accent, and they love all Americans. When they get there (note "Pulp Fiction" on TV) it is true. Women who look like models unashamedly share sleeping quarters with men, give them drugs and have sex with them.<br /><br />One by one the men disappear (as do the Japanese girls) and are tortured to death, aka "Blood Sucking Freaks". Paxton (Jay Hernandez) the last of the trio demands to know where his friends are... The slaughterhouse was filmed at an actual mental hospital in Prague.<br /><br />Sex, nudity, f-bomb, torture.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C7BWPATO40VA.html">A1C7BWPATO40VA</a><br/><p>The first time I watched this movie, I was scared out of my mind. It was sickening, I almost couldn't handle it.<br /><br />However, I rewatched it a few minutes ago and it's not half as scary as it was the first time. It actually became rather humorous since in the end there's a lot of irony to be had. So not so scary or horrific the second time watching it.<br /><br />I'm very sure what's shown in this movie has happened and is still happening in some parts of the world, maybe even in some parts of the US for all we know. People go missing all the time, in many countries it's not even a big deal. "Oh you lost your daughter? Just have another one..."<br /><br />The human species is more naturally prone to violence and negativity, we have to actually work hard to not be.<br /><br />Re-watching this movie, I noticed a ton of flaws I didn't notice much the first time due to being so scared. Do guys typically act this watch around each other? I hope not, I'm a guy and I find the typical a bit insulting.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>I applaud this film for actually taking the time to establish the characters, which rarely happens in this type of genre. Usually, we get a brief glimpse of their lives before they are ultimately killed off one by one. However, I really wish it didnt waste 3/4 of the film with a boring plot.<br />If you love the torture/horror genre, then this will be a dissapointment for you. The true action doesn't beging until about 20 minutes from the end of the movie and by then you are already bored out of your mind. The torture scenes are quite brief actually and while effective, they are nothing truly gut wrenchingly grotesque or even flinching, especially if you are used to watching films like this. Any of the Saw films easily beat Hostel in the blood and gore department and they do it in a wicked and tortureous way. Hostel is not even remotely scary or chilling. There are no jumpy moments. There are no spooky or clever moments. For those who are not used to or dislike this genre, then perhaps this film may affect you. Otherwise, its a forgettable and overrated film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>Hostel is definitely one of those movies that no matter what kind of parent you are, this movie is in no way appropriate for kids at all. My big complaint against this movie is the fact it focuses more on pornography than the purpose it's suppose to serve... to scare you. While it's always gratifying to see naked chicks, this movie takes it too far to the point of where you just get tired of looking at them(I've seen enough movies with this already). The gore and level of violence is definitely disturbing and it will really gross you out. It never scared me because I've seen enough horror movies to know what will probably happen, so that partially ruined the experience as well. The characters are basically a group of foul-mouthed people or they are mentally disturbed which didn't really pull me into the storyline either. And the nudity involving the dudes? What was up with that? Seriously folks, it's really nasty.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Jay Hernandez (Paxton), Derek Richardson (Josh), and Eythor Gudjonsson (Oli) star as three young college students backpacking across Europe.  But their trip is about to take a turn for the worse.<br /><br />Paxton and Josh are from the United States.  While on their trip in Europe, they met and befriended Oli, who has now become part of the group.  Their mission: to do as many drugs and have sex with as many women as possible.  They have also met another person, who tells them about a town in Slovakia, where the women will do practically anything with a man who has an American accent.  Eager to find out, the three board a train and head for Slovakia.  While on the train, the three meet an extremely odd gentleman, who we will see more of later in the film.<br /><br />Once they reach their deatination, Paxton, Josh, and Oli check into a Hostel.  Sure enough, the man was right; the guys end up sharing a room with two gorgeous women, and the sex and drugs begin to flow.<br /><br />However, strange things begin to happen.  Oli suddenly checks out of the hostel without telling Josh or Paxton.  Then, a few days later, Josh does the same thing, only he finds himself in a torture chamber along with the man from the train.  This deranged man is doing unspeakable things to Josh, including slicing his hamstrings.  Meanwhile, Paxton is beginning to become suspicious of the two girls.  The girls tell him that his two friends have been taken to a local art museum.  Angered, Paxton tells the girls he wants to go there as well.  So, the girls oblige, and Paxton is forced into the same cruel situation as Josh and Oli were.  But, unlike his friends, Paxton manages to survive, despite having several fingers cut off.<br /><br />Paxton is able to discover that the "art museum" is really some kind of sick place where people can pay money to kill another person.  It costs the most money for someone to have the chance to kill an American; hence, the attraction between the girls and Paxton and Josh.  Will Paxton be able to survive to tell his story, or will he be caught in the end?<br /><br />I've seen a lot of horror movies, but this has to be one of the most bloody and gory I've ever seen.  I've seen all of the "Saw" series of films, and I think that this movie is even more bloody than those.  The first part of the movie has very little killing, but the second half more than makes up for it.  There are several gross scenes, including the slicing of the hamstrings, the cutting of eyeballs, and the use of a drill and chainsaw.  This is definitely not a movie for the squeamish.<br /><br />I thought this was an ok movie, but not a great one.  The large amount of blood and gore were just too much to handle.  True fans of bloody movies will probably enjoy this movie more, but be warned; the amount of blood and gore in this movie is tremendous.  Watch at your own risk.</p></br><a href="../users/ABP69F7LFTI1R.html">ABP69F7LFTI1R</a><br/><p>Gore and horney backpackers aside, this movie was very good.  Disatisfaction abounds with the super wealthy, here they are, they have everything money can buy, trophy wife, yacht, servants, 3 or 4 homes around the world a garage full of cars.

It's hard to understand why Tarantino would so prominently attach his name to Hostel.<br /><br />Hostel is no Pulp Fiction. Hostel doesn't even come close to the Tarantino-produced 1996 Vampire classic, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RJ74">From Dusk Till Dawn</a>.<br /><br />Hostel is a movie about a whole town that doesn't seem to notice that a giant abandoned factory has been converted into a torture chamber where the wealthy pay to mutilate people for fun. Who knew that there was such a demand for this kind of entertainment by the upper echelons of society!?<br /><br />The story is the simple tale of what happens when a few B-actors acting like B-actors get abducted to be victims for the sadistic masses that patronize the torture factory.<br /><br />There is gore-o-plenty. If you're into scenes of torture you won't be disappointed here.<br /><br />All in all, it's a ridiculously conceived plot line with gratuitous gore. The thrills are few...suspense is about a 0. You could watch this movie without sound all the way through and still have the same experience as if the sound is on. The movie is mostly a visual yuck-fest.<br /><br />Want a good alternative that has a story and *a lot* less gore than you probably think? Go with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EOTVU2">Wolf Creek</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>In his treatise on horror, "Danse Macabre," Stephen King establishes the genre exists on three more or less separate levels with "terror on top, horror below it, and lowest of all, the gag relex of revulsion."  In the wake of "Saw," and with "Wolf Creek" and now "Hostel," it seems clear to me that we are in the heyday of the low card in that particular set.  The goal is to make the weak flee the room, before or after they throw up, and to make the strong put their hands over their eyes, but still sneak a peak through their fingers.<br /><br />"Hostel" is what writer-director Eli Roth did with the freedom Lion Gates Film gave him after his success with "Cabin Fever."  As you probably know, hostels, usually called youth hostels, are what young people use when they are backpacking around Europe.  As you can easily anticipate, "hostel" is real close to "hostile," so you can easily anticipate that this is going to be about one of those places where kids check in, but they do not check out.  Paxton (Jay Hernandez), Josh (Derek Richardson), and Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) are backpacking across Europe, but have only made it as far as Amsterdam and are only having a good time and not a great time.  Then they are told about a hostel near Bratislava in Slovakia where women will have sex with any guy with an American accent.  Since Paxton and Josh are from the United States, they immediately head for Bratislava so they can have sex.<br /><br />Now, at this point the idea that the three are going to die horrible deaths sounds like a good thing, because we are talking two Ugly Americans and a freak from Iceland.  These people are asking for it and the only fly in the ointment is that Roth delivers on the horrible deaths to the point that we are forced to admit that even these people do not deserve what happens to them.  "Hostel" really has two distinct halves, with the European sex trip that opens the film giving way to the giant torture sequences.  Roth even toys with his audience, relying on a combination of suggestions and screams to get you squirming, not to mention thinking that maybe you are not going to really see the gross stuff, and then he starts showing you the gross stuff.  At this point no not feel terror, forget about feeling horror, and just go right for the revulsion.<br /><br />Even though it really takes too long to get to the blood and gore, and even though the film ends up taking its foot off the pedal at the end, I rounded up on "Hostel" for one reasons.  That was because when I got to the point where both I as a viewer and the last character standing were wondering what the hell was going on, Roth came up with an answer that rather that surprised me (Roth tells one of his actresses that "Hostel" is actually inspired by something that really happens, albeit in the Far East rather than Eastern Europe, and that he wanted to do a documentary about it; apparenly she thought "The Blair Witch Project" was true too).  I even felt more horror than revlusion as well.<br /><br />In terms of the current crop of revulsion films, there is s more blood and gore in "Hostel" than in either "Saw" or "Wolf Creek," but that is due in part to the fact the cast of this movie is several time larger.  The other key distinction is that while "Hostel" obviously is set up for a sequel, which Roth is working on this year, it is really the only one of these films to offer any sort of catharsis in the end.  That actually works against this type of film, and you might be surprised that "Hostel" is the most lighthearted of the three.  So "Saw II" has the best squirming scene with the pit o' hypodermics, "Wolf Creek" will leave you the most empty, and "Hostel" will give you the most blood and laughs.  Do not say you were not warned.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2.html">A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2</a><br/><p>When watching this movie I got the distinct impression that Eli Roth, the director, knows and loves movies.  There are times early on when it seemed he was doing cinematic riffs on Hitchcock, at least before the extreme gore kicks in.  The choice of orchestrational music rather than rock or electronic helps to give the movie a rather sophisticated feel.<br /><br />I think I had all of the proper responses to this movie.  I winced.  I cringed.  I noticed how a character who talks about being a vegetarian at the beginning of the movie becomes a cold hearted killer by the end, and we cheer on this transformation, much as we cheer on a similar transformation in  Cronenberg's "A History of Violence."<br /><br />The heroes of this movie, like Eli Roth's previous film, Cabin Fever, are flawed.  They tend to objectiify women and are out to have a good time.  But they never come off as mean spirited.  When friends and aquantances disappear they actively search for them, become concerned when one of them isn't feeling well.  It is a creepy movie that stays with you and has some sembalnce of context.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>Hostel is a gore fest that dares you to not turn away from the screen.<br /><br />As MODERN horror films goes, this is above average. As horror films go, it is below average. This is a far superior film to say....Friday the 13th, but a pitiful film in comparison to the German film "M" (from 1933). Why? Because MODERN horror films don't actually use HORROR (definition: creating a sense of fear or dread), but rather go for the cheap scare: gore and shock. Bill Cosby once said, "It is very easy to get people to laugh at dirty jokes, because they make them uncomfortable. It is much more difficult to get people to laugh at clean humor." The same can be said for gore and shock. It is much easier to get a reaction to them than it is to create an overall sense of fear and dread.<br /><br />Hostel, at times, does create a sense of fear and dread, but not in its scenes of gore and torture, but rather in the anticipation of those scenes.<br /><br />Two American college aged young men and one man a bit older (from Iceland) are partying hard in Amsterdam as they backpack across Europe. They admit to having no interest in seeing the sites, but rather in being as randy as possible and participating in as many acts of debauchery that they can. This is the first mistake of the filmmakers. Since the three lead characters are not morally redeemable, it is hard to feel sympathy for them...with possibly one exception: Josh (Derek Richardson). Josh is quite possible a virgin and his friend Paxton (Jay Hernandez) is making it his job to see to it that Josh gets "lucky". While he does, in fact, get lucky, it would seem that Josh very possibly has feelings for Paxton beyond just good friends. When Josh gets bumped off, his is the only character we feel sympathy for.<br /><br />While in Amsterdam, the guys find out that there is a youth hostel in Slovakia where the women will do anything sexual with anyone who wants it. Lame premise...but supportive of the naive and stupid tourists who would believe that anything goes in a former Soviet block country.<br /><br />This is possibly the film's greatest strength. It capitalizes on the uneasy and unsure subconscious fears of the Western world regarding the old Soviet block countries. Sure, they're the new "wild west" where anything goes, but that can also include the bad with the good.<br /><br />The three guys head to Slovakia and this "hostel not in any guide book". When they arrive, the hostel appears to be more like a four or five star hotel where they have to share their room with three beautiful girls who remove their clothes at the drop of a hat. In fact, the first half of the film is a veritable "boob fest" in that more women run around topless in this than in most hard core porn films.<br /><br />The guys get lucky immediately, but because we know that the hostel is is front for something far more sinister, we are actually allowed to fear for the characters just what is going to become of them. This is the one factor of the advertising campaign for this film that does its job.<br /><br />Once the second half of the film begins, the story switches to a very gory version of "The Most Dangerous Game", where men pay big money to torture, mutilate and kill other humans.<br /><br />I don't think I've given too much away, but to tell more would be giving away the simple plot. Is there redemption? I'll let you be the judge. Is it more than a simple gore film? Not really. Is it amateurish? No. The acting is decent and the scenery and the special effects are quite....realistic.<br /><br />The DVD has almost no extras beyond various commentaries. This isn't Citizen Kane, so I just wanted to watch the film. Thus this sort of "extra" is, to me a waste of time - ego stroking on the part of those involved.<br /><br />It's an inevitable film. One that will surely have sequels. And since you know you'll want to see them, go ahead and get this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>Amsterdam, one of the funnest places in the world.  Where better to begin our trip?  Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) are two horny young men vacationing through Europe with new friend, Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson).  Staying in a hostel in Amsterdam and accidentally locked out after curfew, they are invited in through the window of a neighboring house by an oddball named Alex (Lubomir Bukovy).<br /><br />Alex tells the young men of a hostel in Slovakia where the girls will do anything for Americans, so instead of traveling to Barcelona they leave for Bratislava.  When they arrive, they discover they are sharing living quarters with Natalya (Barbara Nedeljakova) and Svetlana (Jana Kaderabkova) who show the boys a good time.  The next morning, Oli is missing.  Paxton and Josh wind out partying again with Natalya and Svetlana while searching for Oli, and they too are separated after becoming extremely drunk ... or drugged.<br /><br />It is here that this movie takes off, and dips us into the horrors of what the girls call an "Art Show" but turns out to be a horrifying nightmare for those whose admittance is free.  It is here in this exclusive "resort" that the very wealthy pay enormous sums of money to commit torture and murder on real humans.  (5K RUS, 10K EUR, 25K AMR -- I found it a bit ironic that killing an American cost the most, probably because most of the world hates Americans)<br /><br />I really loved the way the film corresponded the sleazier sites of Amsterdam (peep-rooms and streets of prostitutes) and utilized it for the titillating grotesqueries inside the warehouse.  Drill bits, hammers, scissors, metal claws, shackles, chainsaws, guns, and hooks.  Chains with hooks are cool.  It doesn't matter if its fishhooks ala Hellraiser or heavy-duty cargo hooks like Ghost Ship; chains and hooks are a meaty favorite of the true horror fan.<br /><br />Our antiseptic society also craves some nice filth to go with our gore.  There is plenty sludge and muck in 'Hostel'; dirty walls and backed up drains and grimy, stinky goo.  There are rubber gloves, rubber aprons, rubber boots, filthy tools, and cart full of bloody bodies.<br /><br />Some additional niceties worth mentioning are the street urchins, a bit of automotive revenge, a toilet swirly, the chainsaw finger removal (finger chopping with a chainsaw is much tastier than with a knife) and a very satisfactory ending for the revenge bug in all of us.<br /><br />I also got a kick out of the janitorial service.  How would you like to clean up that place ... daily?  Of course, methinks the janitors were slackers, it was still messy when they were finished.<br /><br />For those who like their horror slippery with blood and touched with insanity, 'Hostel' is a must have.  Definitely worth a purchase.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>I think modern horror films are trying to isolate me.  After seeing Wolf Creek I don't want to go touristing in the outbacks of Australia.  Now I can check off Bratislava as a place to spend time partying in hostels.<br /><br />Before I even saw this movie I was worried.  Not that the movie would terrible.  But that the movie would be almost too successful.  The idea is that, for the last half of this 95 minute movie, you are watching guys getting tortured, maimed and disfigured.  Take away the makeup and the fact that this movie involves actors and you are basically watching a snuff film.<br /><br />Now I have been watching horror films for as long as I can remember and probably before I should have.  But I have a firm grasp on reality and am a (mostly, haha) well-adapted 25 year old without a violent bone in my body.  I understand horror films and their cathartic feeling at the end.  Its all about tension and release, providing thrills and an adrenaline rush in the same way I imagine a person gets driving fast cars, jumping out of airplanes, etc.  The only difference is that in sitting in the movie theatre, I don't have to worry about crashing into anything.<br /><br />What I am getting at is that there is a difference between reality and "reelity."  I could easily sit back and decry this as being pornography of violence or no different than a snuff film (with the exception of the loss of life, granted).  Or I could look at it as the perfect exercise in terror.  For those interested in getting their thrills/adrenaline rush in the relative safety of a movie theatre, this film is the perfect way to do it.<br /><br />It begins, ironically enough, as a buddy movie, back-packing in Europe ala Eurotrip.  There are three guys basically looking for pot and getting laid.  It has been the beginning to many a teen comedy and you can see what Eurotrip would have been had Cooper not gone to Wondersexxx but instead found this.  Ultimately ending up in Bratislava (just like in Eurotrip) at a Hostel, they realize they aren't getting what they expected.  What follows is a grisly tour of nightmarish proportions of torture and human trafficking for money.<br /><br />When Eli Roth debuted with Cabin Fever, I saw a spark that this guy knew what he was doing.  I didn't particularly care for most of Cabin Fever (mostly because it was terribly miss-advertised) but I could tell he had a grasp on this horror thing.  And he had a handle on grim or dark comedy.  Hostel is disgusting, it will get beneath your skin much in the same way certain Asian horror films like Audition will.<br /><br />What helps ground Hostel is the fact that the setup is quite  possible.  I'm never one to fully listen to the "Based on true events" hoopla a lot of horror films have been tossing around recently, but this is one film that you can see happening.  In a world that does have snuff films, hostels and people who have an amazing propensity for evil, things that happen in this film could happen.<br /><br />I was afraid I wouldn't like this film.  I thought that maybe it would go too far past the line.  I won't lie and say its not a gross film because it is.  Its depictions of violence are horrific and there were a couple scenes in which I found myself looking away or cringing.  But Eli Roth does something interesting.  What a good horror film does is show us not only the horror in other people's psyche but also in our own.  Its not the monster under your bed you should be worried about, its some of the people out there.  Hostel shows this but also shows some of that in its protagonists.  There was a scene toward the end that has the whole theatre clapping and cheering.  It was a great scene but also illustrates my point.<br /><br />Without adding to the considerable hype (Quentin Tarantino presenting it?  Check.  Both he and Robert Rodriguez claiming its the "scariest American horror film in a decade?" Check...) it can be considered a masterpiece of terror.  Wolf Creek was brutal but I enjoyed it.  Saw I and II showed more on screen than I thought I would ever see in a theatre, but they were fun.  Hostel?  Hostel was an entirely different, more brutal beast.  I love horror films.  I have never had a nightmare after seeing them.  I'm not sure if this is an endorsement of the film, but, tonight, as silly as it might sound, I'm putting off going to sleep.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2ONSLAI3M2X.html">A1R2ONSLAI3M2X</a><br/><p>I just finished watching Hostel. Being a horror movie fan and having heard alot about this movie, I couldn't wait to watch it. I was somewhat disappointed because the first half of the movie was quite boring and pornish. Now, the second half of the movie I have to say was Cool.  Cool gore scenes although I heard the movie was much sicker and gorier than it really was. Kind of a Chainsaw Massacre and Saw ripoff. I would have expected better from Quentin Tarantino and Eli Roth. I'm not sure if there was a "rated" version of the film. I bought the Unrated version. If the rated version was cut down, then I'm sure it would have gotten a 2 star rating from me. If the whole movie would have been like the 2nd half, it would have been a great and cool horror film....... but, I'd suggest horror fans renting it and forward to the 2nd half of the movie!!</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>What rubbish.  I'd been looking forward to watching it (everyone said I should and that I'd like it) for such a long time and finally got to see it today and a)I wasn't even scared, b)it was stupid and c)it was time wasting (I could go on and on but I won't).<br /><br />If you enjoy watching people getting their fingers and eyes cut out and off, then you'll probably enjoy this.  There is not one good thing to say about this movie and I'm sorry for that.  I had high expectations but this didn't deliver.  Don't waste your time on this junk.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>I may be one of the few people who actually enjoyed Eli Roth's first film, Cabin Fever, despite the many inherent flaws to the story, direction and all-over-the-place feel. I never bought into the tagline for that film as once of the most horrific films this generation. I've been watching horror films for as long as I can remember and Cabin Fever doesn't even scratch the surface of what constitutes a great horror film. But it did show me that Eli Roth was serious about genre and acknowledges and honors his roots and influences.<br /><br />Hostel is Roth's sophomore effort, and just like Rob Zombie with his second film (The Devil's Rejects) he shows improvement as a filmmaker and continues to show that he respects the genre he's chosen to be in. Hostel is an exercise in hate, pain and nihilism. There really are no sympathetic characters in the film. Roth instead shows just how debased, cruel and inhumane people can be towards each other. Whether its through verbal, physical and intellectual means. I must point out that this film is not the torture-porn that alot of media-types call it. The gore and torture really doesn't start until fully halfway into the film. Everything before the second half begins can be summed us as soft-core porn. There's alot of nudity and sex in this first half and sets-up the three characters played by Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson and Eythor Gudjonsson.<br /><br />These three college students are shown as boorish, misogynistic, insensitive louts who wish nothing more from their European vacation than sex, drugs, sex, drugs and more sex. It's this behavior that lures them to a town in Slovakia. An Eastern European, Soviet Bloc-era town where the women are stunning and horny to do whatever with foreign men. So, the trio takes off for this haven of horny, easy, beautiful women and the soft-core porn sequences continues once they arrive. But intermixed within these sequences are small bits and hints of dread and uneasiness. There's a certain sense of decay to the town and its inhabitants despite the normal scenery.<br /><br />The second half promptly begins once they arrive in town and check into the hsotel. The gore mentioned by most reviewers are pretty graphic for what was finally given an R-rating. For people like myself and other horror aficionados the gore in Hostel is something we haven't seen before. The gore and torture scenes are in-your-face and Roth owes alot of thanks to Takashi Miike's Audition in how the scenes are presented. Roth's style of directing Hostel really brings to mind Miike's cult favorite. Takashi Miike even makes a brief appearance in the film.<br /><br />One thing that I wanted Roth to do which he seemed to have pulled back from was going all-out in presenting Hostel as a horror exploitation film. This film tries to emulate the gory exploitation Italian and American films of the mid-70's to early 80's. Maybe the MPAA had forced Roth to trim certain scenes to get an R-rating. In certain scenes one could almost feel and sense that something was left out. Maybe the DVD release with an unrated, director's cut will shed some light to this. Roth's influences are plain to see, but he falls slightly short of reaching the lofty heights that Romero, Miike, Fulci, Craven (early), Hooper, Gordon and Argento established with their grand guignol works.<br /><br />Hostel is a very good second offering from Eli Roth who really seem to like the horror genre and is constantly trying to pay it homage. His direction is much better and gone are the campy, almost comedic sequences from Cabin Fever. The film does fail to convey anything original to the genre, but succeeds enough in honoring its bloody past. Roth went from a genre-hack to very promising horror auteur with Hostel. I am hoping his next project is less of an homage to horror's past and he actually adds to its future legacy. I'm happy to give this film a grade of 7/10.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>I originaly saw Hostel in the theatre, and will admit that I am one of those who couldn't make it through to the end.  The level of gore and grossness that Eli Roth brought into this film was shocking, explicit and the most outrageous I had ever seen on screen.  Though there have been many films in the past that have done even worse, Hostel has a more realistic feel to it - and I felt I was actually in the film upon initial watch.  Scary thing.  After awhile, I decided to give it another try.  I am glad I did.  I missed out on a very satisfying ending, and more, realizing there is a film here beneath all the gore and blood.<br /><br />The other thing that got on my nerve the first time I saw Hostel was the ongoing sex and nudity throughout the first 30 minutes of the film.  But, I realized the characters are college boys, and that's just what they do best.  Now whatever the message Roth was sending out with this film or what some people get out of it, I saw a simple message clear as day - trust no one - especially in a foreign country.  And if something is too good to be true, it usually is.  That's what happens with these young men.  And the fact that they are American makes it even worse - there are people that pay handsomely to see Americans suffer, and that's where the real guts (so to speak) of this movie lies.  Torture scenes are brutal and inventive, and will leave a mark (on the viewer too!).  After a few viewings, it seems mild now but still has a very scary element to it each time I watch.  I would have to say its Roth's use of the camera and lighting, and the dark setting where this takes place that makes it so creepy every time I watch.<br /><br />This unrated director's cut contains two verison of the film - thank God.  The original, as seen in theatres, is fortunately there too.  The reason I say fortunately is because the alternate ending on the cut version was very dissapointing - and not satisfying at all like the original.  Fortunately, here you get both.  This dvd is still worth the buy to see the difference between the two endings.<br /><br />I felt dirty and I took a shower - thats how I felt coming home from the theatre that night.  But its ok, its just a movie.  It still has its morals - good defeats evil in the end.  Give it a second try if you haven't yet, all that gore really blocks us from seeing a deeper picture at first.  If you have not seen this yet, watch with caution.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Characters - 3.5<br />Gore - 4.5<br />Story - 3.5<br />Overall - 4</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>need i say more. if you've seen this movie you know what i mean, if you haven't that says it all. that's what happens in those crazy countries, where they got all this underground stuff going on. if you're a tourist you better watch out. it's there house, and you're just a visitor. overall this movie was good. three unsuspecting guys who think they're in for some fun...turns out to be their worst nightmare. there's no escape, and no bodies on your side. there's torture, blood, and gory stuff. makes you kind of flinch and glad it isn't you. i think they managed to do what they set out to do which was make you feel disgusted, and glad you're home. nice job, and jay was pretty good too. i do recommend if this kind of stuff is you're thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>Eli Roth, director and writer, certainly improved from the awful Cabin Fever, a slash and gash that made zero sense whatsoever. Hostel seems like a paragon compared to Cabin Fever.<br /><br />The story by now is well known. Three randy young men - two from the U.S. and one from Iceland - are traveling together. Well, actually, *two* randy young men are traveling with a third young man who just lost his girlfriend and, although young men in general want to get it on all the time (so the film would have us believe) he is, at first, less interested in sex and more hurt by his recent loss.<br /><br />The friends hear of a place in Slovakia where beautiful girls will do anything that men want them to - especially Americans. This, of course, begins a trek from Amsterdam to the city in Slovakia that holds such promise. This isn't remotely believable, unless we assume all three characters to be idiots. Travel hundreds of miles for something they're likely to get (sex) where they are? Let's not forget that they're in Amsterdam, not Mayberry (Andy Griffith Show).<br /><br />But they do, for what would the movie be without said trip?<br /><br />They arrive in a very war beaten town (that would have made me leave immediately - it was creepy and devoid of life), and take up lodging in a co-ed hotel. Lucky for them, their roommates are attracted to them, and they end up getting it on together. Unlucky for them, these girls are Sirens.<br /><br />Oli (the Icelander) is the first to disappear, and the other friends are first confused, and then puzzled when they receive a photo from his cell phone depicting Oli and another girl with largely lifeless looks on their face.<br /><br />Josh (Harry from Dumb and Dumberer) is the next to disappear, and instead of mystery, we are taken directly to where the action is, so to speak. Josh finds himself securely handcuffed to a chair, and a man with little to no remorse (who wanted to be a surgeon but wasn't allowed to) begins to torture him. Without the blink of an eye, or a hint of hesitation, this man (someone the boys oddly encountered on a train - unbelievable) takes a rather long and large drillbit, and drills a hole in his leg, then his chest, etc. etc.<br /><br />Flash back to Jay (Friday Night Lights), who survived the "Siren song" only because he passed out in a janitor's closet after being drugged instead of the bathroom. His survival leads us into a house of horrors as revolting as anything we've ever seen. To Roth's credit, there are "rules" or regulations here. It isn't just a chop shop. It's art that people pay to see, and people pay to see Americans more than any others. That's a nice slap in our face, and perhaps a deserved one, seeing as we are generally disliked the world over at this point in our history.<br /><br />What happens after Jay enters the chop shop is, again, believable within the parameters of the world Roth has created, and the ending is very satisfying.<br /><br />There is another Hostel in the making. This film cost 4.5m to make, and grossed 47m in the U.S., also doing well in the international market. To gross 10x what it cost to make the film means it was a success, so Hostel II isn't much of a surprise. It will be interesting to see how well Roth does this time around - if he's learned as much as he did from the making of Cabin Fever, and if Hostel II is that much better than Hostel.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>So, what's the big deal with this Hostel movie you've been hearing so much about lately?  Well, it's a big deal coz horror films like this don't tend to make their way into the mainstream much.  In fact, I wouldn't say Hostel is a horror film in the traditional sense, but considering the subject matter, what other category would you put in in?  It's horror in the same way that Last House On The Left is horror in that you get people senselessly tortured and killed, and a little revenge thrown in at the end.  Everyone who hated this film is very quick to point out that "it wasn't even scary".  Well, lets cut through the B.S. for a moment.  Since you were a child, have you really seen a movie that was actually scary?  I know I certainly haven't.  Entertaining, yes.  Creepy?  Disturbing?  Yes.  But no movie has ever made me afraid to walk around my home in the dark.  No, Hostel isn't scary, but it is disturbing.  All the tough guys out there are also quick to point out that it's not as gory as it's reputation would have you believe.  True, it's no Cannibal Holocaust, but we are talking about a mainstream film here.  Horror fans won't see gore they haven't seen before, but folks who occasionally dabble in mainstream horror films will probably get a smack in the face with this film.  I think the gore was in an acceptable amount, and handled well.  A movie packed with gore , while entertaining, is far from scary and usually becomes a parody.  Peter Jackson's Dead Alive is a no holds barred gorefest, but the film's hilarious.  Hostel tries to treat it's violence seriously.  The reactions to the violence from the main characters are realistic-they react with terror, disgust and pain.  While the acting from the leads in this film won't get oscars, you have to admire how well they switch from dumb comedy stereotypes to frightened helpless human beings.  Their lameness in the first 45 minutes is almost forgiven.  If these same characters were in a slasher flick, you'd be rootin' for their deaths and cheer when they came.  The intensity of their performances in the torture chamber are good enough that they become human, and while you don't actually care for them exactly(this is only a movie after all, it's not like they're in any real danger) , you don't really want to see them die this way.  The film does a decent job with suspense in the first hour when the guys are starting to catch wind that something wrong is happening.  In fact, the buildup is actually better than the payoff.  The actual torture chamber scenes only take up about ten minutes of the film.  After escaping his room, the main character tries to find his way out of the building(the overall look of the factory is actually quite stellar).  Some decent suspense here, but it kinda plays out like a stealth mission from a video game like Manhunt or Hitman.  Once out, the guy gets the Charles Bronson bug and wants to get a bit of revenge.  This was cool also.  Considering this character was the wisecracker of the bunch, it's neat to see him so serious for the rest of the film.  It would have been so easy to have him deliver some smartass comment to his assailants, and that would have been awful.  Most likely it would have happened that way too if it had been a bigger production.  Folks seem to think the ending was a letdown as well.  Well, I guess every film can't end with a big explosion and twenty minute chase through the streets of Slovakia, which I'm sure Jerry Schmuckheimer would have provided if this was his production.  The ending may have been anticlimatic, but it seemed more realistic to me.  In fact, anyone who would escape such an ordeal would simply run away and not look back, and not even bother messing with the torture people anymore.  The only big mistake Roth made was with that gang of little kids who kill a couple of guys when payed in candy.  This was actually quite stupid and ruined what up to that point was a serious film.  Overall, Hostel is actually a good film when you consider the current state of mainstream horror films.  There's no MTV/Attention Defecit Disorder style editing, and thank God it's not a remake of a great classic horror film.  The humor was more miss than hit if you ask me.  I've also never been a big fan of sex and nudity.  Folks  who hate this seem to always point out the nudity as a redeeming quality to the film, but I always figured if a movie sucked it sucked, nudity or not.  I can't watch a bad film even if it's wall to wall breasts.  Yes, it was a bit excessive in the sex department.  If I want nudity, there are other types of films I prefer to see it in(they're usually in the back of the video store and come in black dvd cases kept behind the counter).  It's certainly not a film I would purchase, but I'd have no problem with watching it again.  Best horror film we'll see come out of the mainstream for awhile.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JYIDH7JIG48H.html">A2JYIDH7JIG48H</a><br/><p>I think some hardcore horror fans will be delighted with Hostel, but this movie isn't for everyone.  The first half is softcore porn, enough to push the envelope of an R-rating.  It's about 2 young American tourists, looking for loose women in Europe (they can't get any at home).  They check into a Hostel where they find their girls, but their friend disappears the next morning, followed shortly by one of the American boys.  It turns out they're being kidnapped by a torture-for-sick-pleasure ring.  The second half is lurid, gruesome, bloody torture along the line of Saw and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, enough to break the envelope - it might have needed an NC-17 rating.  I don't have any problem with that except that it is gratuitous violence for the sake of gruesome lurid violence itself, without any point, without any redeeming surprise twist at the end like in Saw.  You might be attracted to the film if you're a Quentin Tarantino fan, but as a whole the movie's not quite as good as some of his others.  And if you're a fan of objectionably pointless gruesome violence, you'll still find slightly better movies for that.  Personally I liked Saw and Final Destination somewhat more.  For the average movie viewer, it's not scary, just repulsive.  I'm not saying that to dis the movie, just to explain why I can't give it 4or 5 stars.  But I can imagine some horror fans will consider it a 5-star instant cult classic.  It is technically a well-made film, and perhaps redeemed by the possibility it can serve as a warning to young tourists travelling alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROZK0G84RGMZ.html">A3ROZK0G84RGMZ</a><br/><p>This movie is very worth seeing.  Don't expect to be jumping or screaming because that's not where the fear lies in this movie.  It is pure gore.

First it gets "armpit of the world treatment" in "Eurotrip", then it gets portrayed as the center of private enterprise torture in "Hostel". I saw "Hostel" on impulse (seeing Tarentino's name after the film title on the theater's list of show-times) without realizing it was the actually the brainchild of Eli Roth, who apparently intended it as a homage to Takashi Miike's "Audition". It is a slight improvement on Roth's boring first movie, "Cabin Fever". Although neither movie (Roth's stuff does not rise to the level of an actual film) is even remotely scary, at least with "Hostel" Roth keeps his tendency toward "Evil Dead" silliness in check until the last few minutes.<br /><br />Anyway the first half of the film is pretty much a replay of "Eurotrip's" Amsterdam and train travel scenes, including the funny pervert in the train compartment. I found myself wishing very early in the movie that the three guys were traveling with Michelle Trachtenberg. This wish intensified during the sauna scene in the hostel where the only exploitation elements were a skanky Russian blonde and her fat slug-like friend. The movie would certainly have benefited visually from Trachtenberg's presence.<br /><br />Anyway the three guys arrive in Bratislava and Roth slowly reveals that it is the home ground of a club that provides its members with people to torture and kill (watch 2002's "My Little Eye" if you think Roth might actually be doing something original). At this point the thing starts to look a lot more like "Toolbox Murders" than "Audition" and I began to yearn for an appearance by Angela Bettis. But instead Roth gives us a confused Asian girl who can't speak English very well.<br /><br />Fortunately or unfortunately you never actually identify with those being tortured. But there is at least a point to all the torture as it gives the hero a reason to inflict ultra-violence once the tables are turned and the audience an excuse to mildly cheer from that point until the movie itself thankfully expires. There was no audience applause at the end as everyone was in a hurry to get out and have some BBQ down the street.<br /><br />To make matters worse for the Slovakia Ministry of Tourism, the one thing Roth manages to do very well is to convey the isolation felt by a tourist in a strange place and the target on the back of Americans in foreign countries these days. Given our image in the eyes of the world these days if such a torture business did exist it is likely that American victims would be in great demand and would command a healthy price premium. There are not just corrupt police but a gang of street urchins who extort gum and candy from visitors.<br /><br />"Hostel's" wide theatrical release and $18 Million marketing campaign (verses just $4 Million production cost) pay homage to P.T. Barnum's comment: "No one every went broke 'underestimating' the intelligence of the American people". There is little danger that Roth will ever be mistaken for David Cronenberg. Save your money for the "Saw II" DVD.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Hostel (Eli Roth, 2006)<br /><br />[note: 250 words cut from review to meet Amazon length requirements.]<br /><br />Six or seven years ago, I saw Guinea Pig 2: Flower of Flesh and Blood for the first time. Now, for those of you unfamiliar with the Guinea Pig series, they pretty much defined Japanese Extreme Horror in the eighties, and Flower... is the most extreme of the lot. It has no plot; it's just a guy in white face paint and a samurai suit dismembering someone for sixty minutes and change. My copy was a grainy, badly-tracked bootleg, and I was still utterly fascinated at the same time I was repulsed. The main thing that went through my mind is "who would make a movie like this?" When it was over, in some way I have never been able to define, I was changed.<br /><br />I tell you all this at the beginning of this review because, while Hostel falls far short of the high(?) points of Japanese Extreme Horror, as far as American movies go, the films that came before this leave a lot to be desired in the way of bare-bones filmmaking; America's contributions to Extreme Horror have always been somewhat cheesy.<br /><br />Eli Roth, on the other hand, knows how to make a movie; Cabin Fever was one of the best shaggy-dog jokes in years, and the director's cut had gore to rival Takashi Miike's Ichi the Killer. Roth obtained the backing of Quentin Tarantino, who was similarly impressed with his first outing, and the two of them set about convincing the MPAA, I presume, that the reason Americans are utterly incapable of meeting Japanese New Horror on its own turf is because we never went through the painful childbirth of Japanese Extreme Horror. So, then, the question becomes-- what happens when you put a better filmmaker in charge of what is, essentially, a spiritually-bonded remake of the extreme revenge films of the seventies?<br /><br />The biggest criticism I can level against Hostel is not a fair one; simply put, it's not Japanese. Americans have a different set of taboos, and Roth wanted to go whole hog, so he's taking potshots at a whole batch of things that Japanese wouldn't even consider. Because of that, the first half of the film tends to drag. Once it gets going, though, you'll be hard-pressed to tell the difference between this and any Charles Bronson film that comes to mind, except you've got marginally better actors here.<br /><br />Two American grad students, Paxton (Ladder 49's Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Dumb and Dumberer's Derek Richardson) are taking some time off from school and backpacking through Europe. While in Paris, they hook up with Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson in his feature film debut), an Icelander with raging hormones. The three of them are traipsing through Europe in a sex- and drug-fueled haze when they bump into Alexei (fellow newcomer Lubomir Silhavecky), who promises them that there's a hostel in a small town in Slovakia that will cater to all their wildest desires. They set out for it, and find it to be nothing short of paradise.<br /><br />Now, the big problem is, you're already halfway through the movie, and the only scene that begins to do justice to the trailers is the opening credits. Those looking for a Guinea Pig-esque experience will no doubt be grandly disappointed by all this. But hang on, folks, things will start looking like the trailers eventually.<br /><br />The best thing about Hostel, by a mile, is the incredible cinematography. Milan Chadima, who normally acts as a second- or third-unit assistant director on his films, is equally at home filming gorgeous Slovakian panoramas, dark corridors, and the acres of nude female flesh that inhabit the first half of the film. Sometimes, with a movie this beautifully shot, it's possible to ignore a wooden script or bad pacing, but you don't need to here; while, as I said, the first half does tend to drag, once we get into the action, the pacing is pitch-perfect, and the main characters usually turn in good, if not exceptional, performances.<br /><br />But you couldn't care less about that. you want to know about the gore.<br /><br />The gore effects are, shall we say, impressive. It's not necessarily that there are a whole lot of them, it's the pervasiveness of the gore-drenched atmosphere in the second half of the film that really makes it all seem worthwhile. It's mostly just atmospheric, which is where the film falls so short of Japan's entries into the extreme horror world, but Roth does get personal with a minor character, Ikana (Puritan beauty Jennifer Lim). It's Ikana who, if this film has the effect on you that Guinea Pig 2 did on me, will leave you fundamentally changed.<br /><br />When you put all the pieces together, Hostel is flawed, but Eli Roth has traversed far more distance than any other filmmaker in dragging America, and its painfully Victorian MPAA, kicking and screaming into the 1980s. The amount of stuff Roth got away with, even in the theatrical cut, is cause for unreserved celebration. I can't wait for the director's cut, to see how much more he had to leave out.<br /><br />The short version of all this is: if you're looking for a nonstop extreme horror ride, Guinea Pig 2 is no longer the obscure, hard-to-find title it was when I was reduced to buying a crappy bootleg on ebay; you can get a gorgeous remastered DVD now. You can even buy it from Amazon. And you'd probably be better off doing do. But if you want a film that's going to attack American values all the way around, where you just happen to get some good gore in the process, and you want something made in America, you will not, as of this writing, find a film that got major distribution anywhere in American history that fulfills the requirements nearly as well as does Hostel. ****</p></br><a href="../users/A3AKPY4LXIC24O.html">A3AKPY4LXIC24O</a><br/><p>I've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since hearing about its nasty little premise.  The idea of paying money to torture and kill with impunity is creepy beyond all human comprehension.  Sadly the film doesn't deliver enough shocks or squirms to pay off my high expectations.  Like Saw, Hostel tries to ride far too long on the messed up factor and lacks the cohesion required to, well, keep it together.<br /><br />Whether this is a reflection on society at large or my own jaded mentality toward onscreen horror, Hostel fails to provide that much needed jolt to the genre.  By all accounts this movie should have been great.  It's about one hundred fifty times better than Cabin Fever, which so many people seemed to love, so there's a plus.  Eli Roth seems to be getting the hang of the directing thing.  However, there are too many scenes where torture is happening and the imagery is left to the imagination.  This is a movie, we're supposed to see what's happening.<br /><br />So what exactly is my gripe here?  Hostel just isn't vicious enough.  That's right, for some reason Roth and Co. seemed to have held back on what was promised to the audience.  Not once do you forget that the people on the screen are just acting, which is necessary for the suspension of disbelief.  Finally, the truly disappointing bit, the gore is presented more as background than as the proper effusion of bodily fluids. Not that there isn't gore to be found, it's just not anything to tell the kids about.<br /><br />I imagine there will be an unrated director's cut with some tag line like "Too Gruesome for Theaters" or "Here's the Real Movie Folks" and if that happens I'll give Hostel another whirl.  Honestly, if Quentin Tarantino sees promise in the work of Eli Roth that's reason enough for me to follow the guy's career.  If there's a geometric progression to his growth as a director the man could bring the Horror genre something great. In the future.  Not entitled Hostel.<br /><br />Still, this is a solid attempt at brutal Horror, and for that it deserves one handed applause.  Recent amputees don't have the state of mind or the hardware for full fledged applause. Blame the blood loss.</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>Please, do not see this. Save your money. Hostel (unrated) is nothing more than 90 minutes of naked women, drugs and extreme gore.  Hostel is everything you hate about Hollywood filmmaking. Hostel is not a horror movie, but rather a torture movie.<br /><br />I can honestly say that I have never seen a movie with more nudity or gore than Hostel. It is not a movie at all, in fact, because a movie implies that there is a plot and that you are entertained. If you consider people screaming at the top of their lungs to be a choir, Hostel is for you. If you consider the dropping of a paint can, and the resulting splatter to be art, Hostel is for you. If you consider punching another to be a viable form of expressive affection, Hostel is for you. If you want heroin legalized in America, Hostel is for you. If disemboweling people is erotic to you, buy Hostel today! I am serious. That is how disgusting this movie is. The scenes are beyond shocking, and completely sickeing. I am glad my wife didn't watch, for she would have tossed up her dinner.<br /><br />Seriously, Hostel is over the edge and sickening. I am nearly forty and have seen my share of gore and horror movies, but this nearly made me sick. There was endless vomit, limbs being cut off, eyes being clipped out, etc. That is all that Hostel was: a torture movie. People torturing others, literally. This is not a date movie, nor is it a horror movie. It is really not a movie at all. Hostel is a sick fantasy for those who like extreme sex and violence together.<br /><br />Do not watch Hostel. The scenes linger in your mind for days, and you wish you could shake them. Hostel is disgusting and brutal This is the sickest film I have ever seen, and will never give my money to this director's movies again.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 23<br /><br />7 (out of 50).

The idea of being drugged, kidnapped, tortured, and killed by people who are paying to do it, is a great concept for a film. It's just too bad that the movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be.<br /><br />It starts off like "Eurotrip" or any number of cheesy teen sex comedies. Lots of nudity and a number characters acting idiotic and giddy, in a fake atmosphere. Scenes in dance clubs that don't look realistic. Anyway, this goes on and on until the bloodshed starts, giving us absolutely no reason to feel anything for the main characters.Then it turns into the horror film it should be. The scenes of torture are effective and psychologically scary if you imagine yourself in the situation, but in the context of the rest of this movie it just becomes ineffective.<br /><br />The music is terrible. Not in the fact that the music itself isn't good, but for the fact that, A: it doesn't fit the movie, and B: There's way too much of it. There's a scene where the Characters are merely walking across a courtyard, and the music sounds like it should be a fight scene in `Harry Potter.' Completely out of place and distracting, further telling you this is just a movie no need to feel anything for the characters or get scared.Then the end of the movie turns into an unrealistic revenge fantasy that's played out, for the most part, for laughs. So is the movie supposed to be realistic, scary, or funny? Its falls short of any of these things. Eli Roth needs to pick one and do it.<br /><br />You can do a good compare and contrast between this movie and "Wolf Creek" Everything that is wrong with "Hostel", was done right in "Wolf Creek". Both movies are about young travelers getting into horrifying situations; however in "Wolf Creek" the characters actually act like normal human beings therefore you feel disgusted when they get tortured and killed. It's genuinely frightening and realistic, and by all means not "fun" to watch. It makes you feel horrible inside. It's REALISTIC HORROR. I gave "Hostel" 1 stars for a frightening concept and the quick cameo of the famous Japanese director Takashi Miike probably for giving input on the torture scene which he is so infamous for.<br /><br />Realism, Eli.  Please more realism next time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C0PHJN6AUZT6.html">A1C0PHJN6AUZT6</a><br/><p>I had put off watching this movie because it just didn't sound that great to me. Then I watched Bravo's more scary movie momments, and I thought I would get around to it some day. I wish it had been sooner, cause it's great!! Very intense! Now I have to watch Cabin Fever. I think that the plot's original, acting is great, and there was just enough gore without going overboard.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Two American pals named Paxton and Josh(Jay Herandez and Derek Richardson) are traveling around Europe for some fun and sex. They meet an Icelandic man  (Eythor Gudjonsson) during their trip in Amesterdam as they head to a Slovokian city where they stay at a local hostel and get laid with beautiful girls. However, their ideal vacation soon turns into a nightmare of vicious terror as they are taken to a special secret place where criminals torture and kill people for profit, can they escape this living hell?<br /><br />Exciting and violent horror crime thriller from writer-director Eli Roth ("Cabin Fever") and producer Quentin Tarantino, the film is quite flawed such as the acting (you can overlook that) and some of the dialog. But there is some sleazy atmosphere and gory torture scenes to make up for those such as an icky eyeball torture sequence done to a Japanese tourist. The film does pay tribute to the torture films such "Ichi The Killer", "Men Behind The Sun", "Guiena Pig", "Audition", "Mark of the Devil", "The New York Ripper" and of course "Bloodsucking Freaks". Even if the film is tame compared to those movies, it's still a nice and atmospheric shock-feast with sex and violence abound especially hot babes even a cameo by director Takashi Miike.<br /><br />This 2-dis DVD set has the unrated director's cut and the extras include four audio commentaries, alternate ending, Hostel Dissected three part featurette, Kill the car multi-angel interactive featurette, music and sound featurette, Set Design featurette, An Icelandic meal with Eythor Gudjonsson featurette, KNB effects featurette, interview with Takashi Miike, Hostel dismembered International TV special and The Treatment radio interview with Eli Roth.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>There are controversial movies that live up to the promise of being something unique, something different, something that captivates an audience that while revolting them or surprising them it still becomes a movie that you can recommend to others. This is not one of them.<br /><br />The film tells the story of two American friends, Paxton and Josh, who are backpacking their way across Europe. Picking up a Scandinavian friend, they move from hostel to hostel (popular youth hotels that are fairly inexpensive) seeing the sights and doing everything in their power to bed as many European beauties as possible.<br /><br />While out on the town one night seeking women, a local tells them of a hostel in a nearby country that caters to American's seeking action. He leads them to believe that once their accents are known, women will be basically tossing themselves at the two. Off they go in search of naked European women.<br /><br />Arriving at the hostel they discover they must share a room. It turns out their roommates are two voluptuous women who begin the day by changing while the boys enter the room. Hitting the town, the next morning they find their Scandinavian friend gone, leaving with no message. The next night, both are on the town with the two girls (who each has bedded) when they begin to get dizzy. While Paxton passes out locked up in the local bar's stock room, Josh wakes to find himself chained to a chair in the dingiest of basement cells.<br /><br />Thus the promise tales of HOSTEL begins to unfold, where we find that it has all been a set up luring young men and women to this country where lawlessness runs rampant. So much so that for the right price, you can actually kill and torture someone. Which is what happens to Josh. Slices, dices, ankles cut to prevent running away, gouges and more are in store for anyone who is taken to this den of depravity.<br /><br />So much for Josh. Paxton wakes to find his friend now missing. Searching high and low, he too is captured only to escape. But in true heroic fashion, he must attempt to save his friend as well as the young Japanese girl the two met in the hostel.<br /><br />This movie yearns to churn the strongest of stomachs. The effects are realistic but not to the point of causing any realist to think they actually performed these gory acts. While these scenes are not numerous enough to satiate the most deeply disturbed gore hounds, they are enough to cause a bit of nausea in the normal filmgoer.<br /><br />What is truly disturbing about this film is less what is seen on the screen as considering those sitting and watching it. While the film attempts to show how depraved a society we have become where we can find amusement and entertainment in the death and destruction of a human being, it in itself does just that, attempting to entertain us with scenes of torture and bloodshed.<br /><br />Interviews with director Eli Roth (CABIN FEVER) have stated that he found the idea from a web site he heard about on the internet. And he wanted to make people feel disgusted with what they saw, make them realize how terrible people could be, how low they cold sink. He does this in spades. But at the same time, he caters not only to the morbidly curious but the blood loving sadists as well. In showing us the worst he can dream up with people interested in killing someone for entertainment, he does the same by making each viewer a part of the same group.<br /><br />Subsequent interviews with Roth have heard him talk about how the fault of both HOSTEL films lies not with the director or manufacturer of the film but in audiences who just don't get it. This is always a good argument when someone's movies aren't well received (the 2nd fell flat at the box office). Have I missed the boat when Hollywood hails films like this as artistic? Give me entertainment over artistic any day.<br /><br />This film may be interesting to some, and certainly if you are one who feels the need to see controversial films to discover what the hubbub is all about (unfortunately I include myself in this group), you will be satisfied. But for most it will be a reviling experience that leaves you feeling the need for a good hot shower.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>This Widescreen DVD is the "sicker and more twisted" UNRATED" version and that means this version contains scenes that could never be shown in the movie theatres and will not be seen on broadcast television.<br />  Adults Only!

In the wake of "Saw," and with "Wolf Creek" and now "Hostel," it seems clear to me that we are in the heyday of the low card in that particular set. The goal is to make the weak flee the room, before or after they throw up, and to make the strong put their hands over their eyes, but still sneak a peak through their fingers.<br /><br />"Hostel" is what writer-director Eli Roth did with the freedom Lion Gates Film gave him after his success with "Cabin Fever." As you probably know, hostels, usually called youth hostels, are what young people use when they are backpacking around Europe. As you can easily anticipate, "hostel" is real close to "hostile," so you can easily anticipate that this is going to be about one of those places where kids check in, but they do not check out. Paxton (Jay Hernandez), Josh (Derek Richardson), and Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) are backpacking across Europe, but have only made it as far as Amsterdam and are only having a good time and not a great time. Then they are told about a hostel near Bratislava in Slovakia where women will have sex with any guy with an American accent. Since Paxton and Josh are from the United States, they immediately head for Bratislava so they can have sex.<br /><br />Now, at this point the idea that the three are going to die horrible deaths sounds like a good thing, because we are talking two Ugly Americans and a freak from Iceland. These people are asking for it and the only fly in the ointment is that Roth delivers on the horrible deaths to the point that we are forced to admit that even these people do not deserve what happens to them. "Hostel" really has two distinct halves, with the European sex trip that opens the film giving way to the giant torture sequences. Roth even toys with his audience, relying on a combination of suggestions and screams to get you squirming, not to mention thinking that maybe you are not going to really see the gross stuff, and then he starts showing you the gross stuff. At this point no not feel terror, forget about feeling horror, and just go right for the revulsion.<br /><br />Even though it really takes too long to get to the blood and gore, and even though the film ends up taking its foot off the pedal at the end, I rounded up on "Hostel" for one reasons. That was because when I got to the point where both I as a viewer and the last character standing were wondering what the hell was going on, Roth came up with an answer that rather that surprised me ("Hostel" is actually inspired by soemthing that really happens, albeit in the Far East rather than Eastern Europe). I even felt more horror than revlusion as well.<br /><br />In terms of the current crop of revulsion films, there is s more blood and gore in "Hostel" than in either "Saw" or "Wolf Creek," but that is due in part to the fact the cast of this movie is several time larger. The other key distinction is that while "Hostel" obviously is set up for a sequel, which Roth is working on this year, it is really the only one of these films to offer any sort of catharsis in the end. That actually works against this type of film, and you might be surprised that "Hostel" is the most lighthearted of the three. So "Saw II" has the best squirming scene with the pit o' hypodermics, "Wolf Creek" will leave you the most empty, and "Hostel" will give you the most blood and laughs. Do not say you were not warned.</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>If this isn't a B-movie, then it is right on the verge.  At best the special effects are okay (other times they look like something straight out of a Troma movie).  If you are looking for a movie with excessive nudity and bloody violence then "Hostel" is for you.  This movie will leave you feeling distrubed as some of the scenes are extremely intense.  More freaky then scary this movie is not for the faint of heart.  Jay Hernandez is excellent as he and his buddies go in search of the Sex Mecca of Europe (the rest of the no-name actors do a pretty good job - the girls are super good-looking).</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>Well, needless to say that when I saw the trailer for this highly expected film, I was forced to believe that the movie would undergo an entire atmosphere of gothic horror and squirmy scenes non stop. This, however, is not the case. Or, it is at least half the case, to put it nicely.<br /><br />The film is only one hour and a half long.<br /><br />The first thirty minutes, to me, is wasted in a montage of sex, drugs, booze, and little, if none, rock and roll. It didn't surprise me seeing as how Eli Roth clearly explained that, for some reason, he must use nudity in his films in order to capture the essence of the 80's nostolgia that got lost in the undertow of the movies of the ninties. However, we are now in the millenium which means: New Direction.<br /><br />But, on a more positive note, I did like the way the film slowly crept into the dark depths of fear. There are a lot of serial killer movies, supernatural killers, jason, michael myers, flesh-eating bacteria, fear of the unkown, fear of the water, hieghts, or an alien threat. But very few, almost none, do not focus on the fear of being in a room where some stranger gets to torcher you however he or she wants or pleases. So, becuase this is the first movie that hones in on that fear, I have to give the director credit becuase he did what he wanted to achieve; he made me squirm.<br /><br />Now, after watching it once, I was totally disoriented. But the second time around I began to find myself very sympathetic to the three backpackers who were in this feature. It seems as if they were destined to do dumb stuff right before they witnessed the horror of torture.<br /><br />There is even signature lighting and tone that really reveals that this was done by the same people who did the Texas Chainsaw Massacre Remake.<br /><br />In essence, it's an original premise but, for me, it just needed to get there quicker. Could have done without the gratuitus sex scenes and drug hoopla.<br /><br />This movie, in a way, shows you how sick and twisted strangers are when they get bored with there hum-drum lives.<br /><br />Also, to the horror-nuts out there; you should know that there is not much gore in this feature. If I could compare it, I'd say that it was a little more than what the movie SAW brought to the screen.<br /><br />But, another thing I've found is that this is way better than CABIN FEVER.<br /><br />But, when you think about it, Hostel really breaks into two different acts. The first act of the movie depicts the Hostel (a modern day soddom and gomorah) that the three backpackers are staying at. The second act shows how Hostel (meaning crazy) the villianous characters can be.<br /><br />I think, if anything, this movie will surprise you but it is not for the faint of heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A8DI0COTCMRDV.html">A8DI0COTCMRDV</a><br/><p>I'd like to start off by exclaiming that Eli Roth's "HOSTEL" is by no means the "scariest movie in a decade" it could've come pretty close though if the last 20-30 minutes wasn't so un-realistic. With that said "HOSTEL" is one of the most entertaining horror films to come in a decade! Between the nudity,lots of blood,chainsaw's,surgical tools & a one or two very frightning moments i did not feel cheated by the end of this bloodbath. My only grudge is that the creampuff vegetarian boy should have been the one on the surgical table with his chest cut open & the mama's boy should have been the one to prevail! p.s.

When one of the most brilliant film makers name came up at the very end I scratched every previous thought and wanted to see it immeditly.<br /><br />'Hostel' is a fantastic film weather you want to beleive it or not. Even though there are moments that you really wish you didn't have to see the audience is given characters that are developed so perfectly in such a short amount of time that you actually have feelings for the good guys and want the bad guys to be punished. Beleive me you get nothing but a great movie with Hostel.<br /><br />I can understand why Quinten Tarentino chose to work on this movie. There is a very big Tarentino vibe throughout this movie. There is gore blended with quirky action and plenty of humor throughout. Don't even think about the grusome scenes from what I saw no one else in my theater did.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>`Hostel', is the second film written and directed by Eli Roth, whose first film was the popular horror film, `Cabin Fever'. `Hostel' is also prominently `executive produced' by Quentin Tarantino, who seems to aspire to be the Steven Spielberg of the fantasy / horror set. Aside from a few ideas and a clip on the TV in one scene from `Pulp Fiction', it is not exactly what Tarantino lends the movie aside from his very influential name.<br /><br />`Hostel' is an exceedingly scary movie, primarily because everything about its premise is totally believable. It is so believable, in fact, that the director states that the premise is based loosely on actual events. While the story has a strong affinity to `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', it may be even more powerful in that it is set in the heart of a very civilized central Europe (It was all actually filmed in and around Prague, in the Czech Republic, however, most fictional action supposedly takes place in Bratislava, in Slovakia, the other half of the former Czechoslovakia.) This simply lovely backdrop of old European civility makes the foreground story even more horrific.<br /><br />I hope I don't give too much away by saying that the story actually owes a lot more to Richard Condon's short story, `The Dangerous Game' than it does to anything done by Tobe Hooper. While I have no evidence that Roth has read Condon, there have been enough knockoffs of Condon's plot that Roth probably got wind of the story line without actually reading the original short story. And, many of the images, although little of the plot, probably also owe a lot to the great Dustin Hoffman / Lawrence Olivier thriller, `Marathon Man' and its scenes of truly malicious dental torture.<br /><br />While this is a strongly original horror flick, there are some weaknesses which, however, will not deter me from giving this DVD the full five stars, since the extras are so good, they easily make up for lapses due, primarily, to low budgeting. The DVD has five, count em, five commentary tracks by various combinations of director and producer, executive producer, cinematographer, and monologue. Roth says there are so many simply because he has so much to say about the film. These features make the movie an excellent purchase.<br /><br />The primary weakness is the fact that the actual scenes of mayhem are almost, but not quite as good as the famous, original `Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. They will certainly not satisfy the masochists among the audience who watch `King Kong' primarily for the scene where the big ape meets the hapless blond. It is much more of a truer representative of sadism from the sadist's point of view (read the original `Justine' to see what I mean) rather than the sanitized sadism seen from the point of view of the masochist / submissive. The victims in this movie are NOT having fun.<br /><br />The commentaries give a lot of information on the kinds of decisions that go into casting movies, such as the decision not to cast Rutger Hauer, for example, in the role as the lead heavy, if only because Hauer has played that role so many times before, that his appearance would give away a lot of the surprise.<br /><br />There are a lot of minor plot twists that border on the brilliant in their originality. The most interesting is the role-played by the band of Bratislava street urchins. Fagin would have been proud of these lads.<br /><br />A very chilling and entertaining DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>You'll rarely find a mainstream horror film that's gorier or more intense than Eli Roth's Hostel.  When Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and his two pot smoking pals go in search of sex and drugs, they get much, much more than they bargained for, as one by one they get captured and unbelievably and brutally tortured.  That's about as far as the story goes, but there's no need for Hostel to go any farther because Roth more than makes his point.  The film is more of a throwback to the exploitation films of the 70's, focusing less on story and character development and more on sickening gore effects and shocks.  And Roth is not afraid to let his camera linger and not cut away (the eye extraction scene will make you squirm like you won't believe).  Quentin Tarantino executive produced, and his hand can be felt in the final, revenge driven sequences.  Those who grew up with the aforementioned films will find plenty to admire with Hostel, but for those who have been weaned on teeniebopper, Scream-horror or PG-13 Japanese remakes, this should be avoided.  The DVD has a surprising amount of extras, particularly commentaries by Roth and Tarantino, which in itself is a real treat.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>I was expecting to hate this film.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it very much either.  It's nothing really special.  The plot is extremely simple.  3 guys go to Europe to smoke pot, have indiscriminate sex, smoke more pot, drink, and have more sex.  They go to Slovenia, where they get abducted by some locals who runs a business (for lack of a better term) where they entertain wealthy clients by allowing them to torture and kill people.  Do places like this really exist?  Probably, but it's best not to think about those things.  Is this film any good?  Roth builds up a nice sense of dread when you finally get to the torture palace, but that's it.  The film has a great premise, but the execution of it is pedestrian.  The 3 protagonists aren't as boorish as some people have suggested, but you don't really get to know them too well.  They're never developed as real people, just stock movie characters.  This film doesn't have any substance or depth to it at all.  And what's more the film has absolutely no sense of humour.  I like horror films infused with a dark, cynical humour, like the films of Romero, especially Dawn of the Dead and The Crazies.  This could have easily been one of those.  There are too many coincidences, and some very unbelievable scenes (the one where one of the protagonists gives a bunch of vagabond children candy to kill some of the torture guys is so ridiculous).  Roth is trying to emulate Takashi Miike (who has a cameo here), but he doesn't have any of Miike's sense of depth, substance, and sadness (a lot of people miss those things in Miike's films).  Miike is a real artist, as opposed to Roth, who just wants to show a lot of gore and T & A.  I have seen worse gore in other films.  There are other films out there that are far superior to this.  Start with anything from Miike's catalog.</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>When I saw the movie at the flea market for a buck, I said, "What the heck, it's Tarantino." I had trouble following the movie due to a lack of confusing flashbacks (It's a joke.)<br /><br />Three guys are touring Europe doing guy things. They meet a man who tells them about a Hostel in a small isolated town in Eastern Europe where there is an overabundance of pretty women who have nothing better to do than to throw themselves at anyone with a foreign accent, and they love all Americans. When they get there (note "Pulp Fiction" on TV) it is true. Women who look like models unashamedly share sleeping quarters with men, give them drugs and have sex with them.<br /><br />One by one the men disappear (as do the Japanese girls) and are tortured to death, aka "Blood Sucking Freaks". Paxton (Jay Hernandez) the last of the trio demands to know where his friends are... The slaughterhouse was filmed at an actual mental hospital in Prague.<br /><br />Clearly not for everyone.<br /><br />Sex, nudity, f-bomb, torture.</p></br><a href="../users/A28GCEHD00JFZG.html">A28GCEHD00JFZG</a><br/><p>Hostel: 10 out of 10: Half Eurotrip style sex comedy (with a seventies level of nudity) and half the doctor scene from Bloodsucking Freaks, yeah I might as well stop my review right there it's a 10.<br /><br />Director Eli Roth (Cabin Fever) has scored a bull's eye simply by going back to what makes exploitation films great. Thus he produces a film that could have been lensed in the freewheeling year of 1975 rather than PG-13 stuffy year of 2005.<br /><br />The film starts with two American college students and an Icelandic hanger on enjoying some debauchery in Amsterdam. They hear about a nirvana for sex and drugs in Slovakia and they pursue it as if they were traversing the Himalayas to find Shangri-La.<br /><br />What they find is,,, well I won't spoil it for you but they should have stuck with the marijuana brownies and overpriced Dutch hookers.<br /><br />The movie actually makes torture scenes enjoyable again. (I generally have hated the whole torture motif in modern film for example Rest Stop.) Roth unlike his contemporaries shows the gore without those annoying zooming camera tricks. The leads are unlikable in a fun rather than irritating way (not easy to do) and the film has both a wonderful energy and plentiful surprises.<br /><br />Oh and there is copious amounts of extremely well done gratuitous nudity and sadistic gore. One of the best films of 2005.</p></br><a href="../users/A5X1B2HBQUR3P.html">A5X1B2HBQUR3P</a><br/><p>A movie with realistic gore. The movie is crticized for sadistic gore, but its unfair to judge the movie as a censor or non approver of the genre. To rate a movie you must first enjoy the genre. You see sick horror is not everyone's cup of tea and for the people who do enjoy it, it is not a reflection of a freak sadistic nature of theirs. Its just that such movies peek our human curiosities. Its just a dare thing. Can we stand through this sick blood fest. It's also to explore the sick depravity of human nature. The stuff that happens in HOSTEL is something that serial killers do. We have heard the sordid tales. I know its gross, such sort of this violence is out there somewhere in the world happening all the time even as you read this review. Such movies just tap into our curious voyeuristic tendencies to see to what extents evil intents can hurt and kill others. In that we are just trying to do a reality check and want to get offended and turn away from the sick gore but then again we turn back and complete the movie and only to test our limits. All the gore elements are present and the gore is very realistically portrayed. The plot of internet based business elite hunting where people with money can get the satisfaction of tortuing and killing other people for 50 grand also raises questions for me  -- "Is is actually happening in some part of the world". The movie does not have the fatalistic approach of "Saw", there can be some light at the end for atleast one of our characters. Also apart from the gore, you also got suspense till atleast half way through the movie where you are trying to make sense of why all this is happening and why this sick nonsense ...whats the purpose. That is part of the fun.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>For all that has been written about how gross Hostel is, I found surprisingly not as gross as I had expected.  The bloody parts don't show up until the second half of the movie, and even then much, if not most, of the horror is in our heads rather than on screen.  Roth wisely lets us imagine what is happening, rather than showing us, while we get to hear it.  As most good horror directors understand, the stuff we can imagine in our heads is at least as scary as what is on the screen.<br /><br />In one of the commentaries, Tarantino notes that Hostel is like a 70s film instead of a big modern Hollywood movie, because 10 minutes into it you don't already know what the ending is going to be.  I definitely agree.  This extends even to which of the friends is going to be the hero of this movie.  You actually go from kind of hoping they're all going to die, because they're doofuses and jerks at the beginning, to actually liking them.  If you like commentaries, there are 4 of them, and they'll keep you busy for a while.<br /><br />Hostel doesn't have a lot of moments of comedy, but there is some comic gold in there, which is what you would expect from the director of "Cabin Fever."<br /><br />Hostel is definitely worth at least a rent by fans of the horror genre, and is a decent choice for others as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Hostel is about three young men; Americans Paxton and Josh and their Icelandic friend Oli, who travel to Amsterdam in search of drugs and hookers.  In the long run they take their party to a quasi-Slovakia.  Oli goes missing and so does some Japanese girl.  No big deal right? So Paxton and Josh decide to party with some Russian girls and get a little bit too hammered.  So much so that Paxton ends up passing out in a storage room.  Josh wakes up in a dungeon and some Dutch guy starts to torture him, using a power drill and cutting his Achilles tendons.  By the time Paxton gets back to the hostel, everyone is missing, well almost everyone.  Josh finds those Russian girls again and starts pressing them for answers.  He ends up finding an abandoned warehouse where people pay to torture prisoners and he gets snatched up and tortured himself.  I'll stop there as things unfold in a fairly fun, albeit predictable manner.<br /><br />If that kind of story interests you and you're the kind of person that likes to watch excruciating torture scenes, then Hostel is the film for you.  But don't worry, it doesn't desensitize because Hostel's director is so amateur in handling his actors you will not see Josh, Paxton, Oli and their international congregation of half-nude nymphs as real people.  They are like dolls and the fake setting is their dollhouse.  You see, the Slovakia we see in Hostel is not real.  That's right Eli Roth has said "Americans do not even know that this country exists. My film is not a geographical work but aims to show Americans' ignorance of the world around them."  You've got to be kidding me?  Isn't he just as ignorant as his audience?  And why isn't his audience offended by these comments anyway?  With comments like that it makes me wonder, is Hostel not supposed to be convincing?  I'm not supposed to take this movie seriously?  What is the point then?  Anyway, Roth has yet to show that he can make a movie with real acting and a convincing screenplay.  So far, that places Hostel squarely in the great tradition of crappy slasher movies.  Roth is not John Carpenter.  He is not even Steve Miner.  He is simply a guy who capitalizes on a young blood thirsty audience that wants to test itself.<br /><br />I feel like I really just ripped into Hostel.  Something about it bothered me deeply.  On the other hand, something about it also impressed me.  I was provoked in two different directions.  The accuracy and compelling elements that I all too often take for granted in films I think are quality, were absent in Hostel, but that doesn't mean that Hostel isn't a unique and terrifying experience.  I cringed more here than in many films.  I thought Takashi Miike's Audition (Miike makes a brief cameo here, kudos to Roth for respecting his influence) was a classic in the horror genre and had Hostel been any bit as compelling as Audition was, it would've gained great praise from this viewer.<br /><br />There is something hopeless about Roth's films.  Like many good horror filmmakers, Roth will not turn away and will dispatch of a traditional hero-type in a gruesome way without even thinking twice.  No one is safe in a Roth film and his unflinching murders scenes are as intense as any, and they work.  Some people critically call his films "torture porn" and I'm not so sure I disagree with that label.  Then again as a deterrent, I'm not so sure that is such disparaging classification in terms of horror films either.  Hostel and Hostel II made $105 million worldwide combined, and together they cost about one tenth that amount. "Torture porn" sounds like a market brand more than a criticism.  But that does not make Hostel a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Probably you already know the film's plot, so I won't repeat it again. Horror film fans know that there are a set of basic rules in the genre, and you will see `Hostel' is following them faithfully. That means, three backpackers, booze, women and some remote place no one has heard about before. There is nothing new or inventive about the premise, but it is only a starting point for the entire film, so that is alright with me.<br /><br />The most disappointing thing about `Hostel' for me is, however, that the film is not scary very much. The film seldom builds up the tension or the chills before the terrifying events that happen to each character. Things are set up in by-the-number way, never letting us imagine what is really going on in this quiet village in Slovakia.<br /><br />Instead, like his previous film `Cabin Fever' director Eli Roth shows lots of gores and tortures that are dreadful to see, and he is surely good at that. But if you ask me if there is something else that is particularly great about the film, I must say I could find none. The political subtext is cursory, and dark humor only falls flat.<br /><br />The film is "presented" by Quentin Tarantino who must have found something great in this film, but frankly I don't know what part of this film he liked so much as to give his name to it. But this is not the first time; anyone remembering the 1996 film `Curdled' (for which Tarantino served as executive producer) knows what I mean.<br /><br />One interesting thing is that Takashi Miike appears as cameo, an enigmatic businessman warning the protagonist Jay Fernandez to `be careful.' Perhaps this prolific director from Japan could have done a much better job, judging from his works like `Audition.' `Hostel' is after all not a terrible film. It is only passable, having nothing truly scary in it except,  you know, its gruesome torture.</p></br><a href="../users/A34VV92TSLC37R.html">A34VV92TSLC37R</a><br/><p>Eli Roth is quickly making a huge name for himself in the modern world of horror filmmaking.  With the debut Cabin Fever, Roth showed us his wide, unflinching knowledge of the great horror movies from the 70s and 80s that gave him his inspiration.  While Cabin Fever was more of an homage film, with story not really being the focal point, Hostel is pretty much a straigt-up horror film, and a great one at that.<br /><br />Josh and Paxton are two American backpackers in college who are taking a road trip to Europe to get away and relax before they both go into the next phase of their lives (law school, etc.).  Along their trip, they meet up with Oli, an Icleandic backpacker who is just as wild and offensive as the two Americans.  We aren't really engineered to care much about these main characters.  The first half of the movie is more about all the wild, deranged things that go on in Europe, and how easy it is to get women, drugs, or whatever you want.  Basically a soft-core porn film, the opening 45 minutes of Hostel serves purely as setup for the horrible, disgusting things that we all know are coming.  After visiting a hostel in Bratislava, Josh and Paxton get a little worried when Oli disappears without a word of goodbye or anything.  So they both set out to find out what happened to them, and they both get lured into the trap that has been set for many young, stupid foreigners to get what's coming to them.<br /><br />Once the torture sequences start, the movie changes completely, obviously.  Surprisingly, I found none of the gore really shocking, or anything that new to me, but then again, I have seen pretty much any horror movie you can name.  The gore isn't amazing, but the acting is surprisingly good, and the atmosphere is truly amazing, creepy, and disconcerting.  Rather than being a real "horror" film, this movie falls more into the "shock and disgust" category than it does into the scare category.<br /><br />Eli Roth really has grown as a filmmaker.  If you watch Cabin Fever, and then watch Hostel, you can see many differences that make Hostel a much better movie.  Hostel is much more suttle and controlled than Cabin Fever was.  Cabin Fever was so chaotic and random, that you didn't know what was going on half the time.  Hostel, on the other hand, knows exactly what it wants to do, and the entire movie is focused around making a singular point.  Also, I loved the ending of Hostel.  I know a lot of people who were disappointed and thought it was too cliched, but personally, I thought that it was a well thought out ending, and it didn't make the viewers leave the theater feeling absolutely depressed and suicidal.<br /><br />The other part of Hostel that I loved was a single scene near the end of the film, when one of the characters actually gets dragged into a conversation with one of the torturers.  This dialogue is great, and it is with this dialogue that Roth makes the point he wants to make with this movie.  You can really take any point you want out of it, but I felt that Roth was trying to send a message about human nature, and the dark rivers that run throughout each of us at certain moments of time.  Let's just say that Sigmund Freud would love this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A5UMUVEV1RUS9.html">A5UMUVEV1RUS9</a><br/><p>Perhaps an alternate title for this movie could have been "Hostile" because Hostel was quite gory and gruesome, just as I'd hoped. If you couldn't get enough of either Saw or Saw II (and are as excited about the upcoming theatrical release of Saw III) then Hostel is right up your alley. What's most shocking are all the reviews here commenting about the nudity at the beginning of the film. You have to keep in mind that the setting is in Amsterdam and people over there are less hung up about nudity. That being said, I think it fits perfectly into the movie. The story follows 3 guy friends around Amsterdam, who head to another town for the women and the prospect of what these women will do...the locals say the women will do ANYTHING and just love American men. The guys go, and sure enough, sexy women abound, taking them out for a night of fun. Everything seems great until the next morning when one of the friends is discovered to have left. The 2 remaining guys try to find their friend but he never returns or calls them back. Even more disturbing, he's sent them a picture from his camera phone saying he's gone home. But things soon get even stranger in this strangeland and to say more would ruin it for anyone else who's been wanting to see this. If gory and gruesome are things you enjoy in a movie, you should not miss Hostel. I was riveted from beginning to end, and I must say I very much liked the ending too. Be prepared though...this is not for the squeamish. You've been warned. A must-see for fans of this genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>HOSTEL comes to us from Eli Roth, the man who also gave us CABIN FEVER.  Like that film, this one spares little when it comes to some gutwrenching gore.  The movie is almost sadistic in its terrifying view of torture and death and dismemberment.<br /><br />Three backpackers in Amsterdam learn from a native about the available girls in Slovakia who will do ANYTHING for money.  On the train, they meet a weird older man whose identity is secretive but he plays an important role in the movie.  Roth wisely keeps the pace slow in the beginning to give us a chance to familiarize ourselves with the trio, but once the bloodletting starts, it's frenetically suspenseful.<br /><br />Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson give very good performances as the two Americans, and one has to question one's own tolerance in viewing such a decadently "sick" film.  However, Roth's goal to disturb and terrify are well delineated and if you like gory horror flicks, this is a good one.</p></br><a href="../users/A31JRSZQ76YA1N.html">A31JRSZQ76YA1N</a><br/><p>Oh for gawd's sake - this is the soft core version of 'salo' - total fantasy [for the vaguely immature] and quite a waste .....</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Leave it all behind at the door. I expected this to be a quick fix SAW type movie directed by the interesting Eli Roth and what we get is a 21st century rendition of something like "Last House on the Left" multiplied by "I spit on your Grave" plus a bit of Hitchcock in the mix and some Jap horror and we got ourselves an impressive movie that was a hell of a lot better than what it should have been. In fact, next to "The Descent", this is one of the best horrors I have seen in a long long time, another genre reviver and a lot more than just the popcorn fodder that SAW dished up. Memorable scenes include the goofy accountant type sadist, an eye scene, messy heels, a train and some choky vomit. I highly recommend that anyone who has the stomach for it, go watch it, and certainly those who have a taste for the aforementioned type of splatter masterpieces, well what more can we say than Roth knows how to do it right... and with two severed fingers... I mean... a cherry on top. It even had loads of high suspense towards the end. Yeah, I dig this one like I would a grave for an airhead hooker who just got her cap bust for my giggles. This indie movie is all like that kind of sensibility. Not for the masses. Oh the joy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I was in the minority by kinda liking Eli Roth's first film, Cabin Fever, but at least I don't feel alone in liking Hostel. Yes, some reviews here bash the film, but it was a truly hardcore horror film. If you don't like it, go back and watch your overplayed copy of Ring 2. I will be buying this DVD the day it comes out. Bring on Hostel 2!</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6KZT0QG6UKB.html">A3D6KZT0QG6UKB</a><br/><p>Sometimes a B-movie can say more than an A-lister. Example - I am avoiding Munich, because I simply don't care to see a two hour sermon on why violence begats violence and how revenge can get so far out of hand, that it stops being about revenge and only leads to brutality. On the other hand, bring over the latest J-Horror movie about vengeful ghosts, or the latest Korean horror movie with the same theme and I'm totally watching it with you.<br /><br />I know that some are confused about the sudden tone shift in this movie (similar to the one in From Dusk til Dawn - the other Tarantino-associated movie with divisive audiences) but that sudden tone shift is not quite so sudden. In both the opening sequences in Amsterdam and the ending sequences in Slovokia, there's an undercurrent of desperation that the American tourists just DON'T GET. Everyone from the hookers of Amsterdam, the dealers of the clubs, the femme fatales of the hostel and the little kids that want candy and will beat you if you don't give it is taking part in a brutal post-Soviet economy that only The Lord of War (which SHOULD have been this successful but wasn't) touched on with similar honesty.<br /><br />These characters have been compared to the characters in Eurotrip, but the Eurotrip characters are playing it for laughs. You can't compare them to the "reality" stars of Real Cancun since these guys are at least moderately introspective. The best template for this movie would be the 2 minute sequence in Rules of Attraction where a character consumes all over Europe with the smug indifference of a guy treating the entire continent like his fast food place.<br /><br />Eli Roth is a genius in depicting these characters as sleazy but likeable in the first half of the movie. Even the Icelandic character has his moments of decency. They are just likeable enough that you don't want to see them tortured. The second half of the movie becomes an exhilarating exercise in excess, as one-by-one the characters encounter the ultimate institution for tourists with money meeting Eastern Europeans that will do anything for money. The evil kids that wander through the streets brutalizing tourists that won't give them candy or cigarettes (and what they do for a big bag of candy comes at the final reel - yeesh) provide this weird counterpoint to the main action.<br /><br /> I almost think that the Japanese tourists are thrown in to throw down the gauntlet in challenging the superior Asian horror (both Korean and Japanese). If Old Boy ever gets remade into an American movie, only Eli Roth deserves to direct it.<br /><br />So if you don't like movies where people get their fingers cut off, then this isn't for you. If you do like horror movies, definitely watch this thing. It's amazing.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>If young men on vacation are really this shallow and misogynistic - we are all doomed. The three main characters romp through Amsterdam and points beyond, seeking and seeing nothing but naked women who might make themselves available with absolutely no strings. We glimpse what's intended to be the famous red-light district of the Netherlands, but the film really turns the whole landscape into one big red-light district.<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino and the others who give the generally giggling, juvenile DVD commentary on the film, have one brief moment of realization. One of them tosses out the idea that the film is an example of what goes around, comes around. He remarks that the young men start out exploiting women, then end up being themselves exploited in far darker ways in the horror house where they end up.<br /><br />But then the commentators giggle on, showing that no such moral has sunk in very deep with them. And it seems certain that their point in making this movie was certainly not to provide any illustration of poetic justice. Their point in making the movie just seems to have been to make some bucks by getting a writhing of soft-core porn (verging on hard-core) out there on the screen.<br /><br />The actor who plays the prime villain does a good job and provides a few good presaging moments - as he talks about his gustatory preferences. Other than that, this movie is a waste of time unless you are into porn. And then you'd be better off just going into the adult section and being done with it.</p></br><a href="../users/AVF60NZ99H9D5.html">AVF60NZ99H9D5</a><br/><p>This guy doesn't know how to write a screenplay.

He seems to take his characters and their development quite a bit more serious than in his previous effort.  I actually felt some attachment to Jay Hernandez' character once he realizes what's happening in this tale.  With that said, however, I wouldn't rank "Hostel" among the top thrillers or horror flicks in the genre.<br /><br />First off, just having a lot of gore and blood pumped on to the screen doesn't make a film scary.  Many of today's horror fanatics seem to believe that, but those are the same people who cut their teeth on "horror" like the "Scream" series and the later, lesser "Friday The 13th" and "Halloween" sequels.  Introduce these same people to films such as the original and remake of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre," and they'll get a little better dose of terror.  These films actually had terror and suspense in them coupled with the gore.  In my opinion, gore is nothing more than icing on the cake.  I've seen plenty of gory films that weren't even as scary as "Jurassic Park."<br /><br />Another thing that drops "Hostel" down a notch is that it lacks a true hero or heroine in the story.  Sure, Hernandez does attempt to save a fellow torture victim, but before all of this his a typical, American butthole.  You know these types of people, they believe that the world is their oyster and mommy and daddy will always be there to bail them out.  Though Hernandez' character does sort of capture me in the end, he just isn't a likeable enough character who I'd want to cheer on.  In fact, his friend played by Derek Richardson is a more likeable guy.<br /><br />Some of the finer points of this flick include the fact that there is no one bad guy.  The baddies are folks wealthy enough to pay to torture and kill someone for their own pleasure.  None of these characters are of the enjoyable type.  One of the sickest sequences in the film isn't someone being dismembered, but it's the interaction between Hernandez and a soon-to-be torturer describing how great the rush is of offing somebody.  The guy has no remorse or concern in his eye, just the urge to feed his addiction.<br /><br />I also enjoyed how Roth constantly tipped off the viewer of the impending doom for the primary characters.  Slight looks to each other, creepy train passengers, and even the gloominess of Slovakia all pose as wonderful harbingers of what is to come.<br /><br />In the end, we have a solid attempt by Roth to seek out the bowels of mankind.  He almost attains it, but focuses too much on gore and leaves the solid and potentially great plotline to drown in a pool of its own blood.<br /><br />Recommended to fans of the gore genre and Roth's first flick, "Cabin Fever."</p></br><a href="../users/A2G6GO4O7EVCPF.html">A2G6GO4O7EVCPF</a><br/><p>Ah, here we are with Hostel (a supervised lodging for youth) and in this movie Jay Hernandez (Crazy/Beautiful, Ladder 49), Derek Richardson (Reeker, Bring It On Again) and another guy go on a trip to Europe to party and try to find some young hot girls and well, get laid and have themselves a good old time. Well it seems that way at first when some of that stuff happens (complete with girl nudity, sure to give horror junkies or young boys a rising action....I found it to be stupid and useless). One by one the friends start to vanish and find themselves in a complete hell as they are tortured by sadistic people who cut up bodies and all sorts of sick and twisted stuff. Will anyone survive? What will happen? Will Eli Roth make a good movie? Uh, maybe...maybe not. I wasnt a fan of Cabin Fever although I did like some of the visuals and the performances by both Rider Strong and Guiseppe Andrews but I never liked it. Now in Hostel, Eli Roth's first BOMB so far. Roth, let's make an effort. I'm sure Eli Roth fans will get their deserved horror junkie boner from this movie but it's badly acted and a waste of Rick Hoffman (Cellular, Blood Work) and a quick cameo by Audition & Ichi The Killer director Takashi Miike. Roth himself has a cameo as a American Stoner. Quentin Tarantino, you may have been clapping, cheering and hollering but I wasnt. I like you Tarnatino but I dont like this movie. We all have our tastes....I have mine.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E9TRM8096BXU.html">A2E9TRM8096BXU</a><br/><p>I freely admit that I wanted to hate HOSTEL.

I don't think I can be blamed for this. the present, rather depressing trend of horror movies - which for some years has been towards "horror" (meaning disgust) rather than "terror" (meaning the good scare) - has left me itching to pull the trigger on most every new entry in the genre that passes my way, and mostly this urge has been justified.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. As a rule I despise horror movies designed largely to gross out or disturb the audience (I'm looking at you, Rob Zombie), and that is why I wanted to damn the film even before I saw it. And indeed, HOSTEL is truly "horror" in the disturbing sense, since the actual movie itself is far less scary than its concept of torture and murder as a sort of underground entertainment industry.<br /><br />Many of HOSTEL's critics contend that the film is one-half softcore porn and one-half snuff film. Others point out its many implausibilities. A few hold out that the "heroes" are all jerks and make it impossible for the audience to care about them. Some are just disgusted by the torture, which is as graphic as it is vicious. Most of this is true. The first half of the film IS very slow and replete with naked women; the second half DOES show people being horribly tortured and in some cases killed for the sick pleasure of others (surely the definition of snuff); there are a number of implausible and even ridiculous moments, the "good" characters are none of them very good people. But surprisingly, I found that these things did not matter, or at least mattered less than they might have, because of the movie's surprising strengths.<br /><br />First, the acting. It is not great, but it is uniformly good, much better than in most horror movies. The guy who plays Josh is particularly effective in his torture scenes - almost too believable. And the torturers themselves are frighteningly convincing. Second, the way the film opens, with dark-lit scenes of the torture-chair and tools being washed clean of blood by a whistling, unseen figure, strikes a deep creep into your spine - even before we're introduced to them, we know our cavorting post-collegiates are going to end up in it; the chair acts like a horrible magnet throughout the movie, drawing them slowly but surely into its comfortless seat. Third, the concept is just believable enough to do for backpackers in Europe what JAWS did for swimmers in the Atlantic; the idea that this type of thing, in some form or other, does occasionally go on in this world makes suspension of disbelief less necessary than usual in a horror flick.<br /><br />It is true that the main protagonist, Paxton, is obnoxious, pushy and much less likeable than either the funnyman Oli, or the sensitive weakling, Josh; but that did not make his ultimate outburst of revenge-crazed heroics less believable. On the contrary, if any of the three of them were going to kick some torturer a*s, he was the likeliest candidate. And he isn't all bad; midway through the flick he expresses remorse over freezing years back when he might have saved a girl from drowning; and at the end, when he hears the Asian girl scream in agony, he risks his life to rescue her from the blowtorch-wielding "American Businessman." I have to say in this connection that a lot of the things people read into this movie just aren't there - the mild anti-Americanism is meant as a kind of in-joke for its American audience, not insulting to us, and the nudity and sex at the beginning, far from being a heavy-handed morality message (illicit exploitative sex = horrible but deserved death) were mainly used to distract the censors from the gore at the end (it worked, by the way).<br /><br />HOSTEL is not a great film by any means. It has many standard horror-movie flaws and one can certainly question the wisdom and morality of further desensitizing our already violence-numbed populace by purveying this type of thing as "entertainment." Still, horror is defined as "a painful emotion of fear, dread or abhorrence" and on that score, HOSTEL certainly lives up to its billing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>The movie was like this: first part was sex and drugs, second part was a nice little mystery, and the final part was were all the gore came in. I didnt find the movie very gory, so I don't know what all the hype about the movie is. Its too bad they have to make a sequel for this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A38DQCCC64K4W.html">A38DQCCC64K4W</a><br/><p>Yep, it pushes the envelope. But Roth knows what's he's doing, and has created a truly horrific situation with even more horrific consequences. The underlying backstory to why this is happening is evil in itself; Hard to watch and even harder to listen to at times, 'Hostel' demands your attention. It's smart and has something to offer for what it is. And without saying too much, this movie contains payback. Everybody somehow gets a little kharma coming back to them...The acting is pretty good considering the amount of screaming and pleading they have to do, and alot of the violence is more suggested. Could have done without the eye scene, though...</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>I was disappointed by this film. It starts out with three sex crazed, homophobic bigots, who you can't wait to see die. And that seems to go on for hours. Then you get to the horror stuff which was really excellent. The whole look of the torture chamber was perfect and the torturers were very creepy.<br /><br />After that...it turns into a comedy and I don't know why. Going more for laughs than screams. Once the hero frees himself he has little problem escaping and knocking off the villains one by one. And once the kids were stomping on the guy's dead skull I was really rolling my eyes. It goes from creepy horror to total corn ball.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Eli Roth<br /><br />Cast:  Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson, Eythor Gudjonsson, Barbara Nedeljakova, Jan Vlasak, Jana Kaderabkova, Jennifer Lim.<br /><br />Running Time: 94 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for intense, gruesome torture violence, extreme amounts of female nudity, and language.<br /><br />"Hostel" is a very confused, problematic film. On the one hand, it is armed with a dynamite, socially relevant premise and an absolutely blistering albeit accidental commentary of the human condition, judged especially on the audience but, on the other, it is an appalling example of missed execution, bumbling screen writing, and over-hype. It is a dichotomy of contradiction that unravels the macabre with the simple relish of fraternity caliber humor. Rest assured, this is not a very good film, but perhaps there is enough novelty in what will no doubt be a hugely successful film to warrant a look at some point.  The premise and subtext underlying director Eli Roth's ("Cabin Fever") latest film is essentially a dissection of the pleasures that drive two separate groups of vacationers. First, there are the three backpackers traveling as sex tourists across the European continent in pursuit of the carnal pleasures of the flesh. Two of the kids are the typical college byproduct of an over-sexualized culture in which adolescent achievement is measured more by the number of orgasm achieved during the month long jaunt rather than any academic, professional, or personal merit. Complementing this group are the heavies: rich, professional men who for a sizable fee can satisfy their diabolical pleasures of the body through the murder an torture of specimens apportioned out by some clandestine charnal company of mobsters and henchmen. These two groups are two extreme sides of the same coin, both in search of the pleasures derived from other people; one sexual, one absolutely homicidal. A very thin thread divides the two groups of protagonists, perhaps leading credence to the theory that left unchecked, extreme sexual behavior can lead to extreme homicidal behavior.<br /><br />"Hostel" then breaks down in its transition. It turns alternately from a light hearted, "EuroTrip" sex romp populated by one truly annoying Icelandic character to a somewhat dark, more like dimly lighted than opaque, journey into the world of economic sadism but the transition is full of seams. With little of the ominousness of the gruesomely brilliant "Wolf Creek" or the suspense of "Audition", the plot heavy handedly limps from "American Pie" to Hannibal Lector like a jagged scar. Before the audience even has a chance to grasp the nature of the threat, one character is offed off-screen and another has a sit down with the diabolical surgeon who explains pretty much the jist of what is going on.  Also, there was a lack of continuity with the heavies; since the baddies are rich merchants of torture and leather jacketed henchmen, the nature of the villainy lacked a face. Black jackets and walkie talkies don't generate the same suspense as a ghostly Micheal Myers or backwoods mutant. In fact, as two of the principals flee the dungeons, the film digresses into an absurd Inspector Gadget esquire escape, with legions of henchmen pacing back and forth oblivious to the cowering pair skulking their way through the corridors Roth lacks an eye for action as evident here. It was beyond heavy handed, it was contrived.<br /><br />The torture was rather boring, nothing much new: slicing of an Achilles, a dissection, a drill to the foot, clipping of a toe.  It was all pretty pedestrian and attention seeking as personified y its director. The carnage in this film essentially plays out with the suspense of a college party drinking game.  In the end, Roth may have betrayed his own sensibility. Changing tone for the third time in the film, the survivors limp toward a showdown with their tormentors in which retribution is inflicted in such a light hearted manner that one has to wonder if Roth even believes in the subtext of his own film. If sex and sadism are two extreme sides of the same coin, then how can he relishly delight in the slaughter of the heavies with such gratuitously bloody style The audience swooned when the breasts made their first appearance, reviled (mildly) when the torture commenced, and then laughed when the three Hostel wranglers were rundown on the street Is Roth suggesting that the same psycho sexual tenancies exist even in relatively sane people (the audience?) or perhaps was the gore thrown in for the pure geek factor? If it is the former than the joke is on the audience and Roth is laughing at his own fan base. Either way, the change in tempo tended to unravel any horror that could have been generated, by purpose or incident. In the end, the carnage of "Hostel" is tantamount to eating a bad Thai meal; heavy feet and buyer's remorse.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>"Hostel" leads you to believe that this is going to be a very scary movie with lots of violence that haven't been seen before, and all it gives in the end is porn and things done to death in horror movies. The story is so basic; you don't even have to hear what they are saying to get this movie. There are times when I was watching the movie and said something to someone and still understood what was going on, even though I didn't hear a few lines. There is nothing shocking in this movie and it is very predictable.<br /><br />The gore is almost absent and is nothing extreme; I have seen more gore in the Friday the 13th series. About the first thirty to forty minutes of the film is sex and more sex. This is not a film for the kiddies, that's for sure. Overall, if you want a movie that is like this but actually has a good story, watch the Dentist and the Dentist 2. This film has nothing special at all. The movie is not scary and not gory. It misses all the points that made the Saw series great, which it tries to live up to in this film. This movie isn't horrible by any means, it just not all the hype leads you to believe. It is a soft core porn movie with a little blood thrown in.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>This is advertised as a suspense and horror film. It is neither. The movie is extremely offensive. I have never seen more gratuitous nudity and gore in a single film. There is no suspense in this film. It seems made for people who would like to watch other human being be tortured alive. The biggest problem of all is that you can actually partake in these activities in the 21st century in Thailand. And I am sure in many other countries where mammon rules.<br /><br />The basic plot of the movie consists of two male students touring Europe for a break before they finish up grade school. They seem to be moving around on their Euro Rail Pass, hunting girls for sexual conquest at ever lay over. Eventually they meet this guy who shows them they will be assured a sure thing in Slovakia. So they head there with girls on their minds. Instead they are the ones who are hunted, caught and then horribly tortured. Where the director makes sure you see every bloody detail.<br /><br />Two things surprise me about this movie. One is that it was even produced. The second is how any one can give this a decent review. I would recommend that you watch any other movie instead of this one. Do not support torture as a form of entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F2EYORWOZ3G1.html">A1F2EYORWOZ3G1</a><br/><p>Okay, so the sex-and-slice genre has been overworked. But some of the classics still stick out. Like Halloween, Friday the 13th and Scream (All the first in those series at least). So what makes this one stand out?<br /><br />It's the sum of the parts (no pun intended).<br /><br />Tarantino creates a slow developing sense of trouble and paranoia. It builds from earlier in the film than is suspected and continues til the climax.<br /><br />The plot has been gone over here in other reviews so I won't go into detail there. However, Tarantino has brought a polished product to the genre.<br /><br />What really sets this apart is that there is no supernatural elements and no psychotics weilding a knife. The 'Elite Hunting Club' is something that everyday people who can afford to buy their services belong to, just like belonging to a country club.<br /><br />The acting, sets, lighting and music all come together with a slick, fast moving story line that is at once believable.<br /><br />What is most frightening about this movie is that it could really be happening!<br /><br />Definitely not for the squemish! Typical buckets of blood splash across the screen. But, if you're up for a true roller coaster ride and being riveted to the screen and gripping your chair... I highly recommend this thriller. It is sure to become a classic!</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Gotta blame Jim Carrey and Steve Martin.  These dudes' latest box office clunkers were showing at my local theater--leaving HOSTEL the lone remaining alternative inside Theater #1.  I didn't know much about HOSTEL; heck, I didn't know anything about<br /><br />HOSTEL.  But I do like staying in exotic hotels, so what the hey?  I realized this film was produced by Quentin Tarantino, but for all I knew the controversial director/producer could've had a change of creative heart and made a movie about room service and breakfast buffets. Was worth a look, anyway.<br /><br />Well.  HOSTEL, at least at first, was like Comedy Central's "The Man Show" on acid:  three dweebs (two Americans, one Icelander, all unlikeable) traipsing through Europe in pursuit of the ultimate hedonistic high.  The bongs and the broads are plentiful, but our three protagonists (Have I mentioned they're unlikeable?) want more.  They are told of a special hostel in an eastern European country behind the old Soviet Iron Curtain.  They are shown some pics of naked vixens taken via a camera phone--taken allegedly at the hostel of Paradise--and the three guys are on the next train headed east.<br /><br />As predictable as predictability itself, all is not well at the hostel of Paradise, and the three travelers, one by one, fall prey to a meat grinder torture chamber--a warped and demented establishment where patrons from the world over pay exorbitant sums to slice and dice unwilling (and screaming) victims.  One of our three "heroes" manages to catch a break during his fun session and escape (or at least, run around from room to room, from incinerator to parking lot, and back again, and to parking lot again, ad infinitum); the plot then takes on a morbid cat-and-mouse chase, until our "hero" extracts a totally unbelievable and out-of-character pound of vengeance flesh.<br /><br />Writer/director Eli Roth bombards the viewer with blood and wounds and gore galore--yet the carnage looked like something a group of junior high kids would come up with by raiding their folks' freezers and slinging the stuff around.  In fact, the gore very much reminded me of Peter Jackson's early horror offerings (and that's pretty sad).  As another fact, I wasn't sure--by all the nonsensical slipping in pools of blood and split-second amputations and groping for appendages and so on--if Roth was really trying to present a horror flick, or a parody of a horror flick.  And if HOSTEL is a parody, it's a bad parody; if it's a horror movie, it's even worse.<br /><br />But still better than Martin or Carrey.<br /><br />--D. Mikels, Author, WALK-ON</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I have finally watched this notorious film! I must say it was nowhere near as gory as I was led to believe. There is an abundance of nudity in this film and mixed with this sort of gross out torture it really isn't my cup of tea. This movie is a thriller once it gets going and I found myself rooting for the "good guy" as he paid back some of these twisted F**KS! With all the really bad horror movies that come out, I can see why some would like this movie a lot. It is much better than most of the garbage they call horror these days. I am glad I watched it, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would but, I don't think I need to see it again. Life is too short to get wrapped up in this sort of sick disgusting SH** on a regular basis.<br /><br />Happy Holidays Everyone!

Only this time, it's torture. In this film, 3 guys (Hernandez, Richardson and Gudjonsson). are having a good time in Europe. But all that changes when a stranger tells them to go to a Hostel in another part of Europe to get girls.<br /><br />When they get stupid and go there, they meet 2 girls that set them up, and take them to a place where people are paid to torture and kill tourist.<br /><br />In real life, only a fool would fall for a trick like that. It seems to good to be true. But hey, it's a horror movie, can't have a horror movie without dumb victims. The gore in this film is awesome, but there's nothing unrated in this version. Even Roth himself said nothing much was cut.<br /><br />This is a good horror film to see, especially if you wanna have a bloody good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LR4NR0G8KO7C.html">A2LR4NR0G8KO7C</a><br/><p>Three young men travel by train to Eastern Europe, Slowakia if I recall well, and are kidnapped from the hostel they're staying. When they awake they find themselves tied down to a chair facing a sadistic maniak who is in a surgery mood. Sofar<br />the film is looking good, but then the director finds it necessary to show all torture scenes in the most explicit way<br />he can think of. If you are really into sadistic violence you will enjoy all kinds of body parts getting chopped of, but if you are not, you may also think that the director should have left a little bit more to the viewer's imagination.<br />Still the movie has a few strong moments....it is a shame the movie is kind of missing its balance. If Quentin Tarantino was truly connected to this movie, he would have noticed this as well.

You know what I'm talking about, man?<br /><br />No? Well, it's called the Slippery Slope Theory of Adventure: let's say you're bored, rich, jaded, in search of something funky. You start out with porn: first you're letting the wild rumpus begin to beach pix of Lindsay Lohan, then you're scouting for videos in the wee hours of the morning in stores with their windows taped up, and finally you're arranging private audiences with German acrobats in cellar rooms full of vaseline and studded with plenty of hydraulics.<br /><br />You follow me? No? My point is: that's the Slippery Slope. The first time, you're wheezing, sweating, panting with excitement. The second time you break a sweat. The third time you're going through the motions, maybe noticing the pattern of the wallpaper.<br /><br />Still don't follow me? Fine, let's talk about these three idiots---two American, one Icelandic---who get bored of whoring around in Amsterdam and take the advice of a Balkan Svengali to move their tail-chasing to points East: points considerably *far* East, to wit, Slovakia, where War and Horror have left few men, and many hungry women. And if you're American, man, they'll do anything, anything...<br /><br />OK, let's put away the toothbrush, the chainsaw, and the lighter fluid for a sec, alright? Before we get started, something should be said for the slow-burn way in which Eli Roth lets this whole Cauldron Boil thing get started: "Hostel" takes its own sweet time to wind up. Once it winds up it's like some kind of mechanized Destroying Angel, but props to Roth for taking his time to wind up this litle outrigger of grimness and grue.<br /><br />So this is "Hostel": the tale of a bunch of drunkenly feral little meat-eaters, happy cannibals, who unwittingly clamber into the cooking pot and get served to even hungrier diners. Or, rather, a madcap escapade of three Strangers in a very Strange Land, Paxon (Jay Hernandez), Josh (the winsome Derek Richardson), & Oli (the egregious Ethor Gundjonsson), who venture East huning fresh meat and find themselves the main course.<br /><br />All the rest is art, anchored by some damned fine performances and cinematographic witchery: the shriek of the damned in the death-room; the goatish insistence on language barrier as truncheon; the bite of stainless steel through unwitting flesh and bone; the waspish buzz of the chainsaw howling off tile and blood-smeared concrete.<br /><br />But the real question in Hostel, itself a witches' brew of "Lonely Planet" & "The Most Dangerous Game", is this: given enough money, and ample privacy, and total security and secrecy---well, would you?<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>This movie is so schizophrenic that you may think you're in the wrong theater for the first half. A pair of ugly American tourists and their found-along-the-way buddy from Iceland run around Europe in a typical obscenity laden attempt to score as much nookie and pot as they can consume, and are basically rude and spoiled obnoxious turds. (And in typical xenophobic fashion, guess which of the three tourons gets offed first? Hint: He didn't have an American Passport...). In fact, the first part of the film is a cross between a tour advertisement for the gorgeous nature of Europe - "Hostel" has some amazing cinematography - and a soft core porn flick. B**bies? Everywhere.<br /><br />But then comes the evil that "Hostel" is being sold as. Those hot babes? They are evil femme fatales selling out cute tourists to a place where you can pay to have your sickest fantasies played out. (And in another telling undercurrent of conscious, is it odd that the only sick designs that anyone has involve the brutal torture and murder of the victims? And that an American victim fetches the best price? No fantasy hot sex? Oh wait, the ones who have the hot sex fantasies are getting murdered! It's back to the old slasher rule of 70's horror...lower head gets too much action, upper head will get decapitated.)<br /><br />Ok, so I did sit on the edge of my seat for most of the film's second and third segments. You don't get much actual horror from the movie itself, there's a lot of obvious screaming and flying body parts, but no direct shot of said torture (like no-one in the theater I was in could tell the difference...pah). By the film's third act, it's devolved into a cat-and-mouse game of escape with revenge as the primary motivational drive.<br /><br />But with the lead characters in the movie being such dorkwad tourist-morons ('tourons'), the early killing doesn't elicit much sympathy. In fact, with the news of 2005 and early 2006 reporting that the American military is all to happy to ship suspects out the country and off of the radar screen to be "questioned" (hah!) without the quaint regulations of those pesky activist courts, then how hard is it to imagine a place like "Hostel" in a corrupt county where those rules do not apply? And how disturbed will you be when the scene where the little kids turn from candy-chompers to skull-stompers? Or will you, like some in the theater I saw "Hostel" in, cheer them on?<br /><br />Maybe the earlier analogy of "Hostel" to those 70's slasher flicks was not quiet complete. "Hostel" may be more appropriately compared to those 50's and 60's mutant movies where our national subconscious used atomically enhanced critters to scare us into fearing the Cold War. "Hostel" uses images of foreigners running a tourist death-camp to remind us that all it takes is one sleazy non-American with a bankroll to off as many citizens and sympathizers as he can, as long as your willing to pay for the privilege. Quentin Tarantino backing Eli Roth to issue political allegory as horror films?

That's intimidating. A talented director supporting a horror movie. Must be good, right? The trailers looked awesome and the reviews were very positive. So, I decided to watch this (instead of Munich!Doh!) with high expectations. I was expecting a movie like Saw. What I got was half American Pie/ soft porn and half good horror fun.<br />This movie is 1h35 min. long. The first 40 minutes flat out suck. Sure there were some hot babes, all naked, but I went to this movie to see a horror movie.<br />The plot centers around 3 friends traveling through Europe wanting to get stoned and find some hot babes. They find themselves in Amsterdam and have a little fun before some guy tells them to go to Slovakia to find the best girls. They find them, have fun and then things go horribly wrong. The only problem is tha it takes half of the movie to get there.<br />The opening sequence of the movie acts like we're going to be in for a great ride. Don't trust it.<br />For sure, they picked some gorgeous women to be in this movie. So for sure, they're some really nice women naked. But the problem is that I wanted to watch a horror movie not Euro Trip 2.<br />Once the movie kicks into gear, it's great. The ending is also great. One of the 3 friends manages to escape from a basement full of psychos and executes sweet revenge. Anf boy, the revenge is gory as hell!<br />The movie also is powerful. It had a very powerful message. These 3 friends are lokking for a good time but they end up in a very sick world. Kind of like 8mm but on a much larger scale. Sick, rich freaks pay other psychos to murder people in horrific ways. The best part and creepiest may I add is that everyone is connected. And once you get towards the end, you'll see that everything was set up and everyone was in on it. It's very disturbing and sad.<br />My recommendation is to rent it when it comes out on DVD. The first half isn't a horror movie, the last is. What a shame.<br />But the 2nd half will please for sure. While the movie isn't scary but flat out gory, the 2nd half is still good. And if you liked Saw, the 2nd half is a good appetizer while waiting for the 3rd one (if you saw it, you'll know what I mean).<br />So, Hostel is a powerful movie with a great second half filled with revenge at tis finest. The final sequence is great and gory and it will make you scream: kill that stupid piece of sh**! Kill him!<br />Hostel is dissapointing and I nearly left the theater. But thank goodness I didn't because the 2nd half is a true horror movie. Too bad the entire movie wasn't.<br />Now I know what Tarantino should do. He should take Uma Thurman (Beatrice Kiddow from Kill Bill) and throw her in this sick little torture place. That would make for great fun! Please mr. Tarantino, make my day, we want to see Uma kick more a#$!</p></br><a href="../users/A20568D9GRC08W.html">A20568D9GRC08W</a><br/><p>This movie, along with part 2, is truly pathetic. One of my friends somehow convinced me to watch it, saying it was so much better than part 2, which I saw first. It is no better. It is just gore for the sake of gore. To people who say it has great storyline: no, it doesn't. The storyline is just an excuse to show innocent people be mindlessly tortured. I guess this film is loved by so many people because of all the sick freaks in this world, because seriously, who gets a kick out of this crap? Besides the sickos in today's society. I swear, mental therapists could make an entire living off of one Hostel fan.

After that point, it is a quagmire of useless, non-relevent, sex-scenes and expressions of drug use.  After trudging through the first half of the movie, dealing with unrelated mentionings about the female anatomy, one hopes the movie will reach a higher standard and show the horror that was promised.  The only horror here, is the filmaking itself.  While the premise behind the movie is an interesting idea, the filmaker seemed too busy with style over imagery and symbolism over substance.  The film never scares the viewer.  It even falls short of being anything disturbing.

I never bought into the tagline for that film as once of the most horrific films this generation. I've been watching horror films for as long as I can remember and Cabin Fever doesn't even scratch the surface of what constitutes a great horror film. But it did show me that Eli Roth was serious about genre and acknowledges and honors his roots and influences.<br /><br />Hostel is Roth's sophomore effort, and just like Rob Zombie with his second film (The Devil's Rejects) he shows improvement as a filmmaker and continues to show that he respects the genre he's chosen to be in. Hostel is an exercise in hate, pain and nihilism. There really are no sympathetic characters in the film. Roth instead shows just how debased, cruel and inhumane people can be towards each other. Whether its through verbal, physical and intellectual means. I must point out that this film is not the torture-porn that alot of media-types call it. The gore and torture really doesn't start until fully halfway into the film. Everything before the second half begins can be summed us as soft-core porn. There's alot of nudity and sex in this first half and sets-up the three characters played by Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson and Eythor Gudjonsson.<br /><br />These three college students are shown as boorish, misogynistic, insensitive louts who wish nothing more from their European vacation than sex, drugs, sex, drugs and more sex. It's this behavior that lures them to a town in Slovakia. An Eastern European, Soviet Bloc-era town where the women are stunning and horny to do whatever with foreign men. So, the trio takes off for this haven of horny, easy, beautiful women and the soft-core porn sequences continues once they arrive. But intermixed within these sequences are small bits and hints of dread and uneasiness. There's a certain sense of decay to the town and its inhabitants despite the normal scenery.<br /><br />The second half promptly begins once they arrive in town and check into the hsotel. The gore mentioned by most reviewers are pretty graphic for what was finally given an R-rating. For people like myself and other horror aficionados the gore in Hostel is something we haven't seen before. The gore and torture scenes are in-your-face and Roth owes alot of thanks to Takashi Miike's Audition in how the scenes are presented. Roth's style of directing Hostel really brings to mind Miike's cult favorite. Takashi Miike even makes a brief appearance in the film.<br /><br />One thing that I wanted Roth to do which he seemed to have pulled back from was going all-out in presenting Hostel as a horror exploitation film. This film tries to emulate the gory exploitation Italian and American films of the mid-70's to early 80's. Maybe the MPAA had forced Roth to trim certain scenes to get an R-rating. In certain scenes one could almost feel and sense that something was left out. Maybe the DVD release with an unrated, director's cut will shed some light to this. Roth's influences are plain to see, but he falls slightly short of reaching the lofty heights that Romero, Miike, Fulci, Craven (early), Hooper, Gordon and Argento established with their grand guignol works.<br /><br />Hostel is a very good second offering from Eli Roth who really seem to like the horror genre and is constantly trying to pay it homage. His direction is much better and gone are the campy, almost comedic sequences from Cabin Fever. The film does fail to convey anything original to the genre, but succeeds enough in honoring its bloody past. Roth went from a genre-hack to very promising horror auteur with Hostel, but I am hoping his next project less of an homage to horror's past and adds to its future legacy. I'm happy to give this film a grade of 7/10.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>Hostel is a watchable film about two American backpackers who head to a hostel in a European country where they have been promised lots of sex and drugs. It is a setup and they inevitably end up in a torture chamber.  This is where the film includes very intense images and is not for the faint hearted.  However, Hostel is quite unrealistic whereas a film like "Wolf Creek" is actually based on true events of missing backpackers, so the scenes of torture are incredibly disturbing and much more believable than those depicted in Hostel.<br /><br />One reviewer on another site said that the good thing about the film is seeing Americans get what they deserve for their over-confidence and the way they think they are so much better than any other nation.  Well, that is one persons' opinion ... but it was kind of fun to see some American teenagers getting their just desserts after all those ridiculous teenage road movies which are nothing but degradation of women.<br /><br />Hostel is worth a rent, but not sure if it is worth owning on DVD.  Overall, I recommend people watching Wolf Creek over this teenage romp.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>I must admit that these "New Age" horror movies like "Hostel", "Cabin Fever" and the "Saw" movies really make me laugh.  If Stanley Kubrick were alive, he would laugh too.  These movies are not difficult to create, nor do they exhibit any real talent on the part of the director and certainly not the actors.  Nevertheless, I found "Hostel" somewhat entertaining in more of a dark comedy kind of way than a horror flick.  Let's face the fact that there is nothing scary or horrifying about this movie.  It's gruesome and makes you want to recount your fingers and toes to make sure they are all there, but it's not a horror movie in the classic or traditional sense of the genre.  The fear, scary if you will, and atmospheric elements are completely lacking.<br /><br />What "Hostel" stands for is the new age of horror movies (if you can even call it that) that focuses more on torture, pain, suffering and gore more than anything else and is largely unimaginative invoking no sense of fear in the audience but a sense of dread more than anything else.  "Hostel" is indicative of the fact that the horror genre is undergoing a kind of metamorphasis probably because of a lack of creativity and imagination on the part of the creators of such flicks.  For the life of me, I don't see how anyone can call the "Saw" films, "Cabin Fever" or "Hostel" scary in the true sense of the word.<br /><br />"Hostel" is primarily about a group of sex-crazed young men who decide to go to Amsterdam to pick up girls, (mostly prostitutes) and have a good time.  Well, they end up at a place where inflicting suffering and pain is sold to those who would pay to indulge themselves.  The problem is that our sex-crazed young men are some of the most prized torture-objects of these sadistic individuals' insatiable desire.  What proceeds is simply "a tale of torture, pain and suffering" which is basically what "Hostel" is all about.  If this appeals to you, "Hostel" is right up your alley...if you are looking for a scary movie or traditional horror movie, you need to stay clear of "Hostel".  As I said, I found "Hostel" entertaining from a dark comedy standpoint and that's all.  However, I think it's significant to the viewer that not only is the acting extremely poor in this movie, it is also worth noting that there really aren't any characters in this movie (of any significance) worth sympathizing with except for maybe the oriental girl, but she's not a main character.<br /><br />I do not want to give "Hostel" any moral credit as that would insult the creators of this fine flick, but one could look at "Hostel" from a variety of different ways.  Perhaps we should look at the irony in "Hostel" in that when you are on the hunt for something, you could also be the hunted as well, especially in lands that we know little about and where we are also not protected by the laws, liberties and rights that we have in the United States.  A great example of a movie where this is true is "The Midnight Express" starring Brad Davis.  While the parallels may be weak between the two, I think the reader can see where I'm coming from in this regard.  All in all, I mildly enjoyed "Hostel" but not for the reasons that most people liked it.  Truth be told, this movie does not deserve two (2) stars as a horror movie, but for its entertainment value, I'll give it 1.5 stars.  After having seen Eli Roth's "Hostel" and "Cabin Fever", I think it's safe to say that Mr. Roth would not know a horror movie from a cheerio.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FPDWTD9AENVK.html">A2FPDWTD9AENVK</a><br/><p>Two Americans and their Icelandic traveling partner take a trip through Eastern Europe to party it up in a remote hostel in Slovakia, where they are drugged and kidnapped only to be sold off to an elite hunting organization that specialized in human torture. After a mediocre debut with CABIN FEVER, Eli Roth burst onto the scene in his sophomore effort HOSTEL, a filthy throwback to the Exploitation films of the 1970's that solidified his name in Horror.<br /><br />HOSTEL, along with other so-called 'torture porn' titles like SAW or THE DEVIL'S REJECTS, has uniformly split Horror audiences based on its use of torture as a main form of entertainment. To say that Roth simply looks to shock and disgust is to grossly misread the entire film in the same way that many critics have dismissed TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE for being too violent. HOSTEL is far more reserved than any of the films that it is most often compared to, and Roth uses implied violence and terror much more often than he does gratuitous gore. Most of the torture sequences are shot off-camera or in cut-aways, leaving the viewer with the victim's twisted facial expressions or screams of anguish. That isn't to say that there isn't gore, because there is, but the gore is only used to accentuate the scenes, and not to define them. True horror always falls secondary to terror in HOSTEL, though this fact is commonly overlooked.<br /><br />The characters of HOSTEL are another brilliant selling point. These are teens that anyone can relate to, and by working outside of the studio system, Roth is able to write his own fluid and naturalistic dialog without the fear of self-censoring himself for political-correctness. This may lead to some questionable vocabulary, but it lends credibility to his characters. In an interesting twist, Roth has given his male leads distinctly effeminate qualities while he victimizes them in the same ways that most female characters are typically treated in this type of picture. People who appear on the side seem inconspicuous and harmless, which allows the audience to let their guard down along with Paxton, Josh, and Oli as they are lured deeper into the lion's den. Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson are two fun, energetic, and utterly believable characters that draw out a purely empathetic response from viewers that have fully invested in them from early on in the film.<br /><br />Perhaps its greatest strength lies in the mystery behind the sinister organization, itself. Virtually no information is ever revealed about the group or the men that support it, which makes the entire situation that much more intriguing and terrifying. In a genius move, Roth would go back and fully expose the Elite Hunting Group in the film's sequel, even if the attempt was unable to recapture the success of the original.<br /><br />On top of everything else, HOSTEL is a huge crowd-pleasure. Roth caters to a very specific audience, one that revels in gorgeous naked girls and bloody set-pieces. He delivers on every intended level, with a script that is both hilarious at times and painfully excruciating at others. The greatest payoff comes during the revenge sequences, where Roth creates genuinely out-of-your-seat excitement as his characters get their payback against the people that betrayed them.<br /><br />Eli Roth is a Horror fan at heart, and it shows. Though he may have trouble topping this second film, it is obvious that he has a clear control over the genre, and that he has the potential to become one of the next generation Masters of Horror.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>After seeing this movie, I was stunned. Simply stunned.<br /><br />The premise is very good. You have these college kids going somewhere really, really secluded (not the best idea in a foreign country, but hey, many guys will do anything for a 'experience'. The deteriorating conditions were also interesting to watch (ex, one guy disappears, and the hostel manager is trying to cover up, etc etc)<br /><br />The gang of kids was a bit much for me, but it was nice how in the end they helped the sole survivor of the hostel escape, and I also liked how he was resourceful enough to escape the Hostel and take his time, instead of just running out of there screaming. I couldn't imagine laying under a bunch of dead bodies and waiting patiently for a opening to escape, and it was also fitting how he exacted vengeance on the people who were instrumental in luring him and his friends there, though I felt really bad for Kana.<br /><br />My reason for the rating is the sheer gore of it all. This movie would have been more effective if they would have toned down the core a bit, since it was difficult to watch and I often turned away when something was being cut off/away. Overall a solid horror flick, though definitely not for the weak of stomach, be prepared to see lots of blood and mutiliation. 3.5/5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N49TOJZFG48H.html">A1N49TOJZFG48H</a><br/><p>great idea . pretty good story telling . some flawed prosthetic work (the lovely japanese girl) . yeah , that was the point at which the picture kinda derailed for me a pretty fair bit . i thought the acting was uniformly quite good .the ease of our hero's escape strained credibility a good measure also . oh , and the street urchin flip/flop was silly as well . glad i saw it to judge for myself . glad we had a likable and winning protagonist . satisfactory . i liked MR.

Eli Roth has made a viciously tricky classic here. Unlike in his earlier CABIN FEVER, the main characters (Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson) are likeable guys. They're unaware of the fact that their idea of fun- smoking as much pot, drinking as much alcohol, and nailing as many hot babes as humanly possible- is actually exploitive, and could even be dangerous. They are just young, hormonally explosive college kids, out for the experience of a lifetime. This is also their undoing, as they are oblivious to any hint of impending doom. Even after their buddy Oli disappears, they still return to the nightlfe and the two gals they've hooked up with. Hell has to literally open up in their faces before these guys realize they're in deep, deep trouble. HOSTEL is part horror / cautionary tale, part sadistic blast of jet-black humor, and part geo-political commentary. Roth builds the story slowly (they used to call this character development), revealing the true terror in one big switch, like waking up in a bloody nightmare, while suffering from the world's worst hangover! Yes, HOSTEL can be a gruesome, bleak affair, but it is probably not as gory or twisted as rumor has made it out to be. There is a certain morality buried under the bodies and viscera as well. That's another difference between HOSTEL and CABIN FEVER. HOSTEL hits you in the head and gut w/ a hammer for a reason, not simply to shock you and make you sick...</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>With the resurgence of exploitation films--I'll refer to the phenomena as "Torture Cinema"--we've really brought some unpleasant films into the mainstream. Some are good, some are not--just like any genre--but what's fascinating to me is how accepted they have now become. When I was growing up, pictures like "I Spit On Your Grave" and "Last House on the Left" were considered vile films and they had to be discovered. A largely underground, low budget, and independent film community had to support these controversial, malicious films. By today's standards these films still hold unpleasantness but are relatively mild--and graphic torture, violence and gore are at every local mall.<br /><br />I like "Torture Cinema" done well--it doesn't offend me any more than any other film subject. I recently weighed in with a positive review of the Australian film "Wolf Creek". That film became a target of Roger Ebert who regarded it as the most vile sort of exploitation. I'm baffled about why that film was so singled out in an era when anything is permissible. That film had a believability about it, real characters and intelligence. True fans of gore and torture were disappointed because none of that happens until the end, only three people are involved, and much of the violence is offscreen. And yet, while the film might not be for everyone, I will defend it with my last breath as a good movie (and certainly not the appropriate choice to make your example of wretched excess).<br /><br />I bring that film up only as a contrast for "Hostel," another film that doesn't offend me--but also holds none of the artistic merit. "Hostel" is the epitome of "Torture Cinema" as a cartoon. The characters, and I use the term lightly, are American horndogs out for partying and sex. No development or care is spent with fleshing them out as real people--and that's fine. It's night after night of debauchery, scantily clad females, and drinking until suddenly things take a turn for the worse. No one can claim that the beginning of "Hostel" makes a great movie--but what it did for me was to establish boorish character types that I was eager to see dispatched, the more gruesome the better. It was all so fake, no emotion or concern was really at stake.<br /><br />Now the torture, the deaths--they're fine. For those seeking truly demented scenes, there probably isn't enough gore. For those not accustomed to the genre, there's probably too much. The scenes are well shot and executed. But bottom line, while the situation is somewhat plausible, none of the film has led you to experience any realness. So I watched these scenes with amusement, some entertainment, but no real investment in the outcome. And it's all pretty forgettable when you're not connected in any way.<br /><br />And then the hilarious capper to this cartoonish tale--during the escape, our hero accidentally encounters everyone involved with getting him into this predicament and has a chance to wreak vengeance. It's preposterous, empty headed--but slick enough. I hold nothing against this picture. It's not the horror classic some make it out to be, but if you like the stuff--it can be interesting enough. It's harmless entertainment--unless you don't think it's entertainment.

HOSTEL is designed for the young man with an appetite for video-game style plots.<br /><br />The films premise is, at least, interesting. A Hostel in a Slovakian city is a jumping-off point for nightclubs, sexual encounters, drugs ...and murder. The hostel owners are secretively helping a select group of the rich and demented. These wealthy and twisted individuals pay to kill people, and an "art house" on the outskirts of town acts as the facilitator of horrors. For those unweary travelers who happen to fall victim to the wiles of the hostel owners, ending up drugged only to reawaken in Hell on Earth is a gruesome and life-ending discovery.<br /><br />Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and his friends Josh (Derek Richardson) and Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) are three college students traveling through Europe. They stop at this hostel and are quickly enraptured with a couple of young women who have an appetite for sex. Once fully involved with these women, the boys begin dropping off one by one.<br /><br />Fairly pedestrian in nature, this horror film has little to offer in the way of entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A37OOQQLMMKYR8.html">A37OOQQLMMKYR8</a><br/><p>Hostel is one of those movies that have sparked some huge debates. Some praise it as an instant classic and others deem nothing more than vile trash. Often referred to as torture porn, which is the silliest thing I have ever heard. Hostel is influenced by 70s exploitation movies. Right now Eli Roth is one of the most popular filmmakers. So when anybody gets as popular as Eli Roth has you know the backlash is coming.<br /><br />Roth has been hailed the next great horror filmmaker and even by some the savior of the genre. Eli Roth is only one person; he cannot save or hurt the horror genre on his own. There are many talented filmmakers who go unnoticed or struggle for work. Eli is one of the talented filmmakers who is having a career that is taking off and is possibly the most popular horror filmmaker out there right now. And due to that it's made him a sitting duck to be ripped a part.<br /><br />I respect everybody's opinion and I'm sure some people just don't like the work of Eli Roth and that's fine. The most loved of filmmakers will have people who dislike their work and the most hated of filmmakers will have people that like their work. But I do feel Eli Roth sometimes gets a little too much heat from fans and critics.<br /><br />When it comes to a movie like Hostel it's not gonna be for every horror fan, but what I loved about Hostel is Roth, is going back to the old school style of filmmaking and is one of the guys bringing back the long forgotten Grindhouse type flicks. People seem to forget there were movies like Hostel over the years, these types of movies started in the 60s, but the 70s is where these flicks will be remembered. The difference is, they weren't mainstream. They were popular at the Drive-Ins, but Hostel gained mass appeal. And it's been so long in some ways movies like Hostel are new since these movies haven't been done in so long and a lot of the core auidnce probably never saw the flicks that inspired Hostel.<br /><br />Over the last couple of years we have been stuck with lame PG-13 horror flicks and PC horror flicks. Eli Roth is a filmmaker that does his thing and doesn't let PC police sway him from getting his vision out. Right now in America the Liberal way of thinking is taking over. Sex and nudity is now a bad thing. Without sex none of us would even be here. Hostel has a lot of nudity and some sex scenes. Well since the 70s a lot of horror films have. Eli isn't the first person to use that in a horror film. Everything in this country has gotten so damn PC and sexually repressed.<br /><br />The lead characters is Hostel are young, single and on vacation am I supposed to believe that there is nobody out there like these characters? I don't get the big deal with the sex and nudity all of that is a common part of life and again plenty of horror filmmakers and filmmakers of any genre for that matter have used this in their movie, but now suddenly it's a bad thing.<br /><br />What I find rather funny is how many people bash the people who enjoyed Hostel as being sick and disturbed. I find that funny because many of these people also watch horror movies. What's the difference between what happens in Hostel and your run of the mill slasher movie? It's wrong to watch someone get tortured and killed, but ok to watch a slasher flick where people are hacked up? What's the difference? Murder is murder isn't it? Granted a movie like Hostel might be more extreme, but again murder is murder.<br /><br />The screenplay by Eli Roth is very solid; his characters aren't faceless and as thin as the paper they were written on. The characters come across as real people. I've known people who are a lot like the lead characters in Hostel. For me, one of the most important things in a horror flick is how I relate to the characters or if I can see myself being friends with them if this were real life. Eli Roth again created real characters. I'm not really like any of the characters in Hostel, but they weren't bad people. They were having their last moments of freedom before the real word kicks in when they head back home.<br /><br />The first on screen torture scene in Hostel doesn't come until the 40-minutue mark. Prior to that there are 2 deaths. One being off screen and the other as it begins there is a cut and we don't actually see anything, which makes the one we finally see a lot stronger. Unlike the slasher film, Eli Roth actually spends the first half of the movie developing the characters. In other horror movies the makers drop building up the characters and get right into the action and faceless characters.<br /><br />A lot of the people who bash Hostel are so off base; Roth could have taken the easy way out and jumped right into the action and made a movie with nothing, but gore and violence through out. But again the guy takes the time and develops the characters. And when the action starts we have come to know the characters and feel for them. Hostel isn't violence just for the sake of it. Never once does Eli Roth glorify the torture and murder scenes. I have seen plenty of movies where the filmmakers do that.<br /><br />As a director Eli Roth is showing a lot of promise. I don't wanna start a Cabin Fever/Hostel debate, but he really grew as a filmmaker in-between films. That's not to say Cabin Fever was bad. It was an enjoyable flick, but you can see how Roth grew as a filmmaker. The first half of Hostel was well done with the set up and the 2nd half has some great suspenseful and tension filled moments. The scene when Paxton is about to be tortured was classic.<br /><br />The whole 2nd half of Hostel was excellent; the comedy is toned down, which is a good thing. When it comes time to build suspense I hate when filmmakers have to throw in comedic moments. Often it's a tension breaker, but Roth pulls no punches and goes straight for the tension. While there is a scene or two with comedy the way it's done really adds to the movie. When you break it down there is a lot more to Hostel than people realize. The characters are well developed and there is some solid suspense in the 2nd half.<br /><br />People say Hostel isn't scary so it sucks. Unlike other type of horror films, movies like Hostel don't rely in the traditional way of scaring people. Picture yourself in another country, your friends disappear you are a stranger here, you can't' trust anyone. Or if anything picture yourself in another state. The scares aren't the typical boogeyman hiding in the shadows scare. The chance of something like Hostel actually happening is a good chance compared to the never ending run of slasher movies, which are pure fantasy.<br /><br />The acting was also quite solid; normally these types of movies feature weak acting, but Hostel had a solid cast and Jay Hernandez does a fantastic job at carrying the movie. His performance was real, he wasn't an actor he was the character of Paxton. The rest of the cast is solid, but Jay was the stand-out. Rick Hoffman though nearly steals the show in his brief scene.<br /><br />In closing, Hostel is a solid movie that is getting way too much heat. It's only a movie people. Eli Roth showed some great promise here and Hostel is one of the finest horror movies of the decade. I'll admit upon my first viewing I didn't quite like Hostel, but going back and watching it I realized how much more there was to Hostel than I first thought.</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>Even if the previews for this movie looked terrible and even if the movie didn't have tons of hype backing it up (stories of people getting sick and passing out in theaters) and even if it didn't have Quentin Tarantino's name plastered all over it, I still would have seen "Hostel." Why? Writer/director, Eli Roth, won me over with his first flick, "Cabin Fever," which definitely had a style all it's own and I've been dying to see what he would come up with next. Afterall, the guy's got just as sick of taste in horror as he does in humor. Needless to say, if you go into "Hostel" knowing what kind of movie you are seeing, you really won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The previews make this movie look like an extremely graphic, intense flick where people are being tortured for 90 minutes. I'll admit, I bought into it and sat down in the theater prepared to have my usually strong stomach put to the test. However, this isn't that flick. Just like "Cabin Fever" was misrepresented and therefore, misunderstood back in 2003, due to a poor advertising campaign, so is "Hostel." Judging by most negative reviews, it seems people went into it under the inlfuence of the ads, which seem to promise a bloodfest. Not to say this movie is wimpy, as it has it's share of gore, but it's not as brutal and unrelenting as it looked like. Eli Roth brings his own flavor once again to this movie, and just like Cabin Fever, it's one of those movies that you never quite know what to expect. Injected throughout are sprinkles of Roth's signature sense of humor, but unlike "Cabin Fever," the movie doesn't end in one big punchline involving rifles. The cast, led by the superb Jay Hernandez (who makes his role as human and realistic as possible) is perfect for this movie, and the European setting alone is intriguing enough to sit through this movie for, if not for the bounty of bare breasts (this movie must hold the record).<br /><br />So, when you consider the wasteland that is Winter movies ("Big Momma's  House 2," anyone?), "Hostel" is the oasis in it all. Here you will find a movie that is interesting, original, makes you think, and entertains all your senses at once. As Roth's second film, it's a winner. Obviously it has it's flaws, but such can be forgiven. As by the time you walk out the theater, you will be wondering what you would do in this situation, or if things like this really go on in the world. You've been warned: Don't go in expecting carnage. It's just a unique, slightly bent horror flick, the kind that only Eli Roth could deliver.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>Hostel is a horror produced by Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill), directed by Eli Roth (Cabin Fever), and starring Jay Hernandez (Carlito's Way: Rise To Power), and Derek Richardson (Dumb And Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd).<br /><br />You've heard the story before, so I'll just recap: Hernandez and Richardson play two Americans who, while vacationing in Europe, get stuck in the most gruesome and terrifying experience one can ever imagine. Along with an Icelandic buddy they met during their trip, they are lured to a town right outside Bratislava in Slovakia where the girls will presumably give in to any guy who speaks with an American accent. They meet two attractive locals, and later find themselves chained in a horrifying chamber where men dressed up as surgeons pay to committ random acts of torture.<br /><br />Before watching Hostel, I was hesitant in forcing myself to watch a movie I knew would probably make me nauseous, but to be honest, it wasn't all that bad as they make it out to be.<br /><br />Even though I found Hostel a bit flawed, the idea of the movie is original, the execution is accurate with all the gore and disgust, and the act of revenge in the ending is refreshing...all within 94 minutes of running time.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B-</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>I'm gonna start off with the goods.<br /><br />The movie is original and has a good feel to it. The mood is set as three Americans travel across Europe in search of drugs, sex and more sex. The feeling of when and where is it all gonna go bad is delayed nicely and it keeps you interested despite the slow pace getting down to the nitty gritty. Yet, when it all does finally go down, the shock value is strong and unexpected.<br /><br />What they eventually stumble across, is more adventure than they were looking for. A sadistic game of torture, brought about by cat and mouse and they unwittingly fall into the trap.<br /><br />Now the bads.<br /><br />First off, in a way, it's a good, because when it finally does happen, it holds more punch, but it took a long time to get into the danger that the movie is based on. Much of the film is taken up with set up... travel, sex-capades and things that really don't have anything to do with anything that unfolds in the film. This is not a huge deal to me.<br /><br />Where the film lost me, is when Paxton is finally strapped to the chair and his torturer is having his way. What unfolds is a series of ridiculous coincidences and clumsiness that leads to his getting free. He yells something at his torturer that is not subtitled, but it stops his torturer for a moment. Then his torturer starts up a chainsaw, SLIPS IN SOME BLOOD and chainsaws his own leg. Then of course... there's a gun!<br /><br />I hate coincidences. While I was into this film, at this scene, which was probably the most important scene in the film... I rolled my eyes and didn't care anymore.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. This is actually a good film. Better than Cabin Fever. Certainly not THE SCARIEST MOVIE IN A DECADE, which has been promoted. Maybe the most VIOLENT. HOSTEL is a movie that, in my opinion, missed a lot of opportunities to really be special when it hit the coincidence super highway, and for me, fell into mediocre land.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>I watched this film one night on an "off" mood, AND all by myself which didn't help.  I guess I witnessed something deeper than what alot of other people saw in "Hostel".  It's not your average horror flick where you want all the characters to die and get it good.  By the time things went "south" in "Hostel", I sort of "cared" about the 3 tourists guys and the 2 Japanese tourist girls.  This film touches a primal nerve in anyone who is human, if you feel deeply about humanity and all that stuff. I did not expect "Hostel" to become an evil, witchy, and sadistic film (which it did, and took it's sweet time about it).  There was a realness I haven't quite seen captured in horror films and I don't know how they did it.  Maybe because "Hostel" flips the script on you, and taps into human fraility and vulnerablity which we all possess.  It exploits all of our weaknesses.  There was an understated sadness throughout the film, you could sort of see it in the characters eyes.  You  feel disconnected and lost when they are in Amsterdam and even more disarrayed when they make the journey to the hostel from hell.  It was eirie and surreal when they arrive there and just got more bizarre and disheartening as the film went along.  Alot of people say it wasn't bloody or gory enough.  I think the psychological mind f*@#$ is worse than  typical movie FX.  They show just enough to make you crawl inside your own skin and want to die there. I have never in all my life had to literally hit the stop button and end a movie out of pure "fear" or "sickness".  I had to turn it off after the white guy got it.  Unfortunately,  I have yet to see the rest of the film but have heard alot through hearsay.  After I turned it off, I paced around my house for an hour and sort of began having mild "panic attacks".  I ended up having to wake up my roomate and explain what was happening.  Since then I have calmed down but I still intend to watch the rest of it.  I would like to say I absolutely hated "Hostel", but instead I have to say this film literally did what no other film has done to me.  It made me think about it days afterwards.  I would like to say the director and ALL of the actors did an incredible job.  They made this film beyond memorable, so good for them. In hindsight,  leave it to Quintin Tarantino again for involving himself in brilliant filmaking.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>A lot of people keep calling this a Quentin Tarantino film.  He did not direct or write it.  It is written and directed by Eli Roth of Cabin Fever fame.  Quentin is his friend and encouraged him to make the movie, and signed on as a producer to help promote the film, but it is not a Tarantino film.  The film itself is an ultra violent film with tons of disturbing images.  If you are a 70's horror film fan, such as Last House on the Left, this is the modern day equivalent to it.  You have lots of sex and nudity, then some sick torture, and by the end, a nice revenge film.  For those who saw Cabin Fever, this film is even more extreme, and the humor of Cabin is left behind.  I really enjoyed the film, but I would not recommend it to anyone by a diehard horror film fan, or someone who wants to gross out a squeamish girlfriend.</p></br><a href="../users/ABFOAYZA2UHD3.html">ABFOAYZA2UHD3</a><br/><p>not because of all the slicin and dicin. but cause it depicts very accurately the world we live in.<br /><br />i will not be recanting thefable, as you can read that in other readers' reviews.<br /><br />the scary bit about this movie is the picture of our youth, flower and future of mankind, in constant pursuit of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll.<br /><br />emptiness and misdirection of man who, having tried EVERYTHING, loses the joy of life, loses taste for things simple normal and nice.<br /><br />the scariest bit about this movie is knowing that this sort of thing happens to people (not to mention animals and plants) like you and me, right now, in hellholes of our planet.<br /><br />exploitation of man by man, raping and killing each other and the nature, is raping and killing our own souls.</p></br></body></html>

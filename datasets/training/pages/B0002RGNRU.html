Wow. The rubber faced Canadian comic has certainly come a long way since the days of "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" and "Dumb and Dumber." Heck, he's come a long way since his turn as The Riddler in one of the Batman movies. As far as I can tell, Carrey suffers from the same affliction that infected Steve Martin and Robin Williams, namely the disease that convinces wildly popular comedians to turn their backs on stand up in favor of careers as "serious" actors making "serious" films. Think about it. Martin went from such classics as "The Jerk" and "The Man with Two Brains" to "Grand Canyon" and "The Spanish Prisoner." Robin Williams's turn towards the dramatic is even starker. He turned in memorable comedic performances in the television series "Mork and Mindy" and movies like "The Survivor" before moving on to the depressingly downbeat "Jakob the Liar" and "One Hour Photo." What's going on? Well, once comedians hit it big, they worry about becoming pigeonholed in funny flicks. So they immediately seek out meatier roles, preferably ones with Oscar winning potential, in order to achieve longevity in Hollywood.<br /><br />"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" defies easy explanation. If I had to sum the film up in a few words, I'd say it's a story about how we need both good and bad memories to experience the fullness of life. How we get to that conclusion is the interesting part. The movie introduces us to a miserable looking chap named Joel Barish (Carrey) as he rides a train through the countryside on a rather bleak day. Our hero (or is it anti-hero?) has about had it with life. His biggest problem seems linked to bad relationships, but all of that is about to change when he runs into Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet). The two immediately strike up a rapport, and it becomes quite clear that Joel and Clementine couldn't be further apart in demeanor. Barish slinks around as though he's trying to hide from the world, never talking above a hoarse whisper. Clementine is wild, with blue hair and an extroverted personality that screams, "Look at me!" Nonetheless, the old adage that claims opposites always attract seems to bear fruit here. Joel and Clementine strike up an intense relationship that soon finds them living together in a blissful state of love. As in many relationships, love doesn't last.<br /><br />One day Joel discovers that Clementine has decided she's not only had enough of him, but she's also decided to erase any memories of their time together with the help of a place called Lacuna, Inc. Run by a kindly doctor named Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), Lacuna operates a facility that can literally burn memories of any event out of a person's head. When Joel discovers what his love is up to, he decides to retaliate in kind. Unfortunately, once Barish is under the knife (metaphorically speaking) he decides that he doesn't want to lose his precious memories. What follows is a rollercoaster ride as recollections both good and bad fly through Joel's mind. We enter his mind and follow the pair's relationship backwards, at least I think it's backwards, and see how things went so wrong. We also see why Joel fell in love with this wonderful woman in the first place. The best parts of the film show us how Barish tries to hide Clementine in his childhood memories to protect her from Lacuna's invasive procedures. A subplot involving Mierzwiak and his subordinates Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Mary (Kirsten Dunst), and Patrick (Elijah Wood) plays a big role in the film's twist conclusion. "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is definitely not your typical Hollywood romance flick.<br /><br />First and foremost, I want to commend Jim Carrey for his work in this film. Anyone who has seen his manic comedy bits and over the top acting skills will express the utmost astonishment at his incredibly subtle performance in this movie. He conveys a real sense of pain and vulnerability without coming across as forced or insincere. The actor also plays the comedic bits well, mainly the memories of his childhood, without going for broad slapstick. Just as excellent is Kate Winslet. I like this actress anyway, and would watch her in practically any movie she chooses to do, but she's quite good here. She plays off Carrey perfectly, and the two have great onscreen chemistry that makes a relationship between them more believable. I can't say I cared for the subplot involving the Lacuna employees, which I initially thought only added unnecessary clutter to a storyline that demands your full and undivided attention, but their presence becomes important as the film progresses. The conclusion wouldn't work, for example, without Mary giving Joel and Clementine some important items that help them figure out what's going on. I was appreciative of any help at this point because this is one confusing film. Subsequent viewings are practically mandatory.<br /><br />Listening to the commentary track helps. Director Michel Gondry and writer Charlie Kaufman shed a bit of light--perhaps sunshine is a better term--on the movie's intricate plot. A making of featurette and a conversation with Carrey and Gondry provide further insights. The disc also gives us deleted scenes, a music video, and an infomercial for Lacuna, Inc. I liked the movie immensely, but I'm not sure "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" rates highly as a date movie. My girlfriend quickly bored of the twisting plotlines and promptly fell asleep, leaving me to ponder the film's inimitable charms alone. Oh well. Watch Gondry's film, and then watch it again. It's worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>After eighty years of cinema, the film industry is running out of original ideas.  There seem to be more and more remakes of old films, or recycled ideas, everyday.  I find this loss of originality to be quite depressing.  That's why I'm overjoyed to find that there is still some creativity in Hollywood today.  "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is a perfect example.<br /><br />Jim Carrey stars as Joel, a man who one day discovers that his lover, Clementine (Kate Winslet), has had him erased from her memory after their relationship has gone over the edge.  In retaliation Joel decides to have his memory erased as well, but it's only through doing so that he realizes all the good times they had together.<br /><br />Charlie Kaufman is one of Hollywood's most important writers, and certainly one of its best living screenwriters.  Before bringing us "Eternal Sunshine", he's written such greats as "Being John Malkovich" and "Adaptation".  Thanks to Mr. Kaufman, I feel happy knowing that there is still such a thing as an intelligent script nowadays.<br /><br />One of the things that leads this movie is the cast.  If ever I had any doubts about Jim Carrey's acting talents, they were cleared up after this movie.  Mr. Carrey is excellent, and thanks to his performance I really sympathized with his character.  Kate Winslet is also terrific.  These two are both equally deserving of an Academy Award nomination.  Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood and Thomas Jay Ryan play in supporting roles.<br /><br />At the director's helm is Michel Gondry, and he knows how to steer this ship.  Jon Brion's emotional score really adds to the film.<br /><br />I am proud to declare "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" as my pick for the best film of 2004.  This is one of the greatest films of recent years, and in my opinion one of the best films made.  "Eternal Sunshine" truly is a spotless film.</p></br><a href="../users/A4UKBG3M5U5TI.html">A4UKBG3M5U5TI</a><br/><p>Charlie Kaufman has become the go-to-man for scripts that bend time, place, and traditional conventions: he's scored another winner with "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."  Teaming with Director Michel Gondry for the second time (they made the semi-flop "Human Nature" in 2001), they have made a great film, perhaps the best from a Kaufman script.<br /><br />Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are the unlikely stars, both cast against type.  Carrey excels as a withdrawn and depressed man who meets a free-spirited neurotic, played by Winslet, who's never been better.  The two have a fling and seem to bring out the best in each other, although it quickly devolves.  Winslet decides to have her memories of Carrey erased by Lacuna Inc., which jump starts the time-bending plot.  Kaufman's scripts are always pleasantly off-beat and funny, as is "Eternal Sunshine."  However, what Kaufman has added this time around are some keen perceptions about relationships.  Carrey and Winslet manage, against all odds, to portray a believable couple and the results are genuine moments of understanding and heartbreak.<br /><br />Every remaining element of the film is superior.  Gondry's direction is masterful, aided significantly by the cinematography of Ellen Kuras (Blow, Swoon).  The supporting cast are also excellent: Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo & Elijah Wood (as the amusing memory-busters), and Tom Wilkinson.  Overall, this film is the best of 2004 so far and stands poised to become a modern classic.<br /><br />DVD Extras: The DVD is packed, including interviews, a behind-the-scenes documentary, a director's commentary, and deleted scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>In the modern world, we've come to rely on technology as a means of deadening our pain and mitigating the unpleasant realities of our lives.  We medicate ourselves to avoid both physical and psychological suffering, confident in the belief that the elimination of all sorrow and discomfort will somehow lead to happiness.  But what would happen if someday we developed the technology to systematically wipe from our minds the memories of a person with whom we fell out of love or who fell out of love with us?  Given the choice, which would we rather have, a painful memory of a failed relationship or no memory of that relationship at all?  It's not an easy question to answer for, after all, don't sadness and pain play every bit as vital a role as happiness and joy in defining who we are as human beings?  Don't we need those low points to make the high points that much more meaningful and real?  These are just some of the questions posed by "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, " a romance-cum-science-fiction tale that is yet another demanding, provocative brainchild of Charlie Kaufman, the man responsible for "Being John Malkovich" and "Adaptation."<br /><br />In "Eternal Sunshine," Jim Carrey plays Joel Barish, a buttoned-up, play-by-the-rules stuffed shirt, ground down by routine and unsuccessful in the ways of love, who meets and falls head over heels for Clementine (Kate Winslet), a high-flying free spirit who opens up new vistas of experience for the nervous, unadventurous young man.  However, if it is true that opposites do indeed attract, they also have the power to repel, and Joel and Clementine soon find themselves drifting apart over their many innate differences.  In fact, they are drifting so far apart that Celementine has decided to undergo a medical procedure that will effectively erase all traces of Joel from her memory.  When a heartbroken Joel learns that she has done this, he retaliates by doing the same with his memories of her.  The vast majority of the film takes place in Joel's jumbled mind as he is undergoing the procedure to nullify his one true love - and regretting his decision halfway through.<br /><br />The synopsis for this movie fails to do justice to the sheer brilliance of both the concept and the execution, as we are taken through a cascading cavalcade of reality and fantasy, memories and recollections, all highly revelatory of the relationship between these two people.  The movie is like a glorious kaleidoscope in which the writer and director, Michel Gondry, continually twist the picture in such a way that we never know what the next image or concept will be, yet with their hands so firmly placed on the instrument that we always know where we are at all times.  Even if we don't always understand every single scene or image at the moment we are seeing it, we know that it will all make sense once the full scenario has played itself put.  If "Eternal Sunshine" reminds us of any one movie, it is most likely Stanley Donen`s "Two For the Road," that great 1967 film starring Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney that also used an ingenious structure of interlocking time periods and events to show us the growth and disintegration of a romantic relationship.  "Two For the Road" did it while operating solely on the level of conscious reality; now, Kaufman, by delving into the subconscious world of half-remembered incidents and ephemeral dreams, ratchets up the concept a notch or two higher.  Even though "Eternal Sunshine" keeps shifting the planes of its reality, the audience never loses its bearings for a single moment.<br /><br />Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have never been better than they are here, creating characters who are compelling, likable and utterly believable as they make their way through this convoluted but wonderfully challenging maze of a screenplay.  It's amazing how believable and touching Carrey and Winslet manage to be in the midst of all this seeming disorder.  They root the film in the human reality all fantasies need to be compelling.<br /><br />Towards the end, as the film brings all its disparate elements together on a single plane of reality, the movie asks us to ponder yet another difficult and challenging question:  is it possible for two people in a failed relationship to drift apart for awhile, then reunite successfully if they go into the renewed relationship fully cognizant of those elements that drove them apart the first time around?  It is just one of the many intriguing ideas to consider in this brilliant, creative and thoroughly fascinating film.<br /><br />As with Kaufman's  previous cinematic mindbenders, "Eternal Sunshine" occasionally feels a bit too cute and a bit too clever for its own good.  However, this film suffers less from this malady and feels to be more of a piece than his earlier works.  With a Kaufman film - and with "Eternal Sunshine" in particular - we know we're getting something original, unique and intellectually demanding, which is far from the normal state of affairs when it comes to mainstream American moviemaking.  "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is a film for the ages.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>I really have to get out more because I wasn't even familiar with this film until about a month ago, when one of my friends told me how good it was and said it was probably the type of film I would like. I've never been a big fan of Jim Carrey's movies, so I held off watching it for a few weeks - only to learn that my friend was right on target with her recommendation to me. I can't imagine how this incredible motion picture experience escaped my attention for so long. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is just incredible, the kind of film that renews one's faith in motion pictures. Every time I think Hollywood's last glowing embers of originality and intellectual beauty have been snuffed out by an endless rehashing of uninspired sequels and re-makes, a film like this comes out and blows me away. Let me be perfectly clear: I absolutely love this movie.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind isn't your typical Hollywood faire. It's a complex film that some will undoubtedly find confusing, and that's okay. For those who love a deep, multi-layered, challenging motion picture presented in an ingenious, somewhat risky manner, though, this film is something to shout about. This is a romance, a drama, a comedy, and a marginal science fiction (concept-wise, anyway) film all rolled into one exquisite ball that can leave you laughing one minute, crying the next, and tossing and turning all night trying to push the story out of your mind long enough for you to fall asleep.<br /><br />To succeed, this film had to have great performances by all of the main characters - and it did. Jim Carrey was amazing; I'm not a big fan of his over-the-top comedic films, and I wasn't sure he could pull off a role such as that of the shy, quiet, introspective Joel Barish - he definitely surprised me here. Kate Winslet made the movie for me, though; she is simply enchanting as the quirky and delightfully spontaneous Clementine Kruczynksi. Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, and others turned in solid performances in the form of secondary characters, but this film is really all about Joel and Clementine.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the unusual but definitely heart-warming romance of our two charmingly unique lovers and their subsequent decisions to have each other erased from their memories. Joel wakes up one day and finds Clem gone from his life; she truly doesn't even know him anymore. Naturally, this would devastate and confuse any man; when he finds out she had him erased from her memories, he naturally decides to do the same thing rather than live with the pain of losing her. As he begins reliving the memories as they are erased, though, he realizes that a lot of wonderful memories are being taken away from him. Helpless to stop the procedure, he fights as hard as he can to keep Clem in his heart and mind.<br /><br />I've just described the movie, but I really haven't described it at all - not by a long shot. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the kind of film that defies description. You really have to experience it for yourself - and I would encourage you to do so. This is truly one of the most memorable, exquisite, touching films to come along in a long, long time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind had a very interesting concept for a movie, and a twist on your typical rom-com movie. It is basically about the way interfering with memories can result in something bad - ie. The Butterfly Effect & Total Recall.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Jim Carrey playing the funny man in movies, then I suggest you don't see this movie, unless you're interested in seeing him play a relatively different role. What shocked me was his appearance in this. He looked really old. It's these bags under his eyes, and grooves down the side of his mouth, and the hair was unwashed, and he was unshaven a lot of the time.<br /><br />The start credits don't start until 17 minutes into the movie which is a very cool effect. There is one main story, the love between Clementine (Kate Winslet wearing a wide selection of wacky wigs) and Joel, and an underlying story between Kirsten Dunst's character, and the doctor of Lacuna Inc. Which seemed pretty much pointless, as there was no incline that they had a "past", and suddenly it just happens for no reason. But I suppose if you haven't seen this movie, then expect the unexpected.<br /><br />There are quite a few scenes which were cut out of the script for this movie, which I reckon would have been very interesting. The original script featured a cut beginning and ending sequence that took place in the future. In the end, an older Clementine comes in to have the procedure done and a look at her screen shows that she's had the procedure done multiple times and all of them involved Joel. At the very end of the script, an older Joel calls Clementine to ask why she hasn't called, but the technicians performing the procedure erase his message. Other cuts in the original script include a montage of memories people wanted erased, including a soldier seeing his dead friend on a battlefield and a girl who was raped at a young age. Another sub plot dropped from the script was Mary ( Kirsten Dunst) finding out that Howard made her get an abortion after they had the affair resulting in her desire to have her memory wiped.<br /><br />If you look at your DVD collection and find mostly rom-coms (not me of course!) then this is the DVD for you to get. It's certainly a romance with a twist. I can't say I was that keen on Jim Carrey not playing the funny guy. And he had TWO assistants listed in the credits, plus hair and makeup people who weren't needed! This will also get you thinking, as I know for certain, if I went through this procedure, I would lose quite a few years of my life! Imagine all those memories, just gone.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I should have seen this movie sooner, but I didn't and now I'm kicking myself for not having voted for Kate Winslett come oscar season.  Kate deserved her oscar over Hilery, even though Hilery was moving none the less...and whats up with Jim Carreys oscar snub.  He reaked oscar in his role here as Joel, a man who falls in love with a spontanious yet charming Clementine (Winslet) only to have his happiness cut short when Clementine has Joel erased from her memory.  Now Joel, in an act of haste, decides to have her removed as well and so he does, but while undergoing the procedure he realizes he doesn't want the memories gone and so he fights to hide Clementine in other places of his mind so he can keep her forever.  It's a unique look on life and how we as humans, while striving to move on never should forget the past for it makes us who we are.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>There hasn't been a movie ever since Pulp Fiction that has really made me watch with full attention not knowing what to expect in the next scene. Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is a genius form of storytelling.<br /><br />The movie is simply a love story but with an original plot and excellent performances by the two lead stars Jim Carrey (The Truman Show) and Kate Winslett (Titanic), Sunshine is an instant classic.<br /><br />The movie might be a little awkward, but the detailed direction of Michael Gondry gives you no excuse not to be able to follow along understanding what is going on. The film is about a shy man named Joel who meets an eccentric girl named Clementine (like the song!) and immediately they fall in love.<br /><br />Clementine's behavior takes a toll with Joel who begins distrusting her, so Clementine leaves him and erases him out of her memory with the help of Doctor Howard Mierzwiak, played by Oscar winner Tom Wilkinson. Joel goes crazy as a result and ends up at the same doctor's office to have his memory cleaned up of all memory of Clementine.<br /><br />Most of the movie takes place in Joel's mind from here on. The essence of the picture is that Joel realizes, as his treasured memories of Clementine begin to fade away one after the other, that he still loves Clementine and attempts to get out of the procedure before it's too late.<br /><br />Jim Carrey is quite surprising in his dramatic, but funny, turn. A turn that will most definitely earn him Hollywood praise (and a golden statue!) in the future. Winslett, who was nominated for Best Actress for her work here, is incredibly convincing and proves to be perfect competition for Carrey.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine is by far one of the best movies of the past ten years.<br /><br />Highly recommended<br /><br />A+</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>Just because I loved it doesn't mean I understood it.<br /><br />Jim Carrey plays Joel Barish, a nice guy, very shy, who finds it hard to get to know women. Kate Winslet plays Clementine Kruczynski, a free spirit who dyes her hair all sorts of unnatural colors as whim takes her. She works in Barnes & Noble so Joel knows where to find her. So imagine his surprise after a night of falling in love he goes to B&N to see her and finds that she's talking to a much younger man (Elijah Wood, who plays Patrick, a technician) and acts like she doesn't even know Joel.<br /><br />It turns out she has gone to a doctor who is able to selectively erase memories of any particular person from one's mind, and has had Joel erased. Joel is sufficiently insulted and distressed that he arranges for the procedure to have her erased. But things do not go quite according to plan.<br /><br />The various interlocking stories are told in flashbacks which are effectively the memories as they are being erased, in which both Joel and Clementine keep wanting to resist the erasure and remember one another. It's a very trippy, surrealistic movie, but it's wonderful.<br /><br />We all better hope Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) never becomes real. Apparently we are all better off with our memories intact, even of the painful bits.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>For many years, I have been a fan of Jim Carrey's wacky brand of comedy.  I consider "Dumb and Dumber" and "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" to be the funniest movies of all-time, and can watch them over and over without fail.  However, I had always been skeptical about his ability to pull off a really dramatic role.  Sure, he was decent in "The Majestic" and "The Truman Show", but in my mind he would always be typecast as that goofy guy with the impossibly stretchy face and crazy voice accents.  That all changed after viewing "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind".<br /><br />Though trying to give a brief plot description of this film is like trying to determine what "Alice in Wonderland" was really all about, the basic premise centers on the two characters of Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet).  When their once-loving relationship begins to fail miserably, both opt to partake in a new scientific procedure in which all memories of that person are erased from your brain.  Clementine completes the operation with no difficult, but Joel has a much harder time letting go, and his journey through his own mind (as he re-lives his relationship with Clem) comprises much of the film.<br /><br />To me, one of the greatest compliments you can give a film (ala Back To The Future) is to not quite know what genre to place it in.  Walk into your local video store (or peruse any online source) and you could find this movie in "Comedy" (for Carrey's name and subtle touches), "Romance" (for the lead relationship), "Drama" (for the aching love story), or even "Action" (for the incredible visual sequences that director Michel Gondry composes).  The only two films I can remember watching that took my breath any at the end are "Vanilla Sky" and "The Sixth Sense", and this one tops those by a considerable margin.<br /><br />The acting is also fantastic.  Remarkably, Carrey makes a strong case that this may be the best role he's ever played (comedy included), while Winslet is every bit his equal in terms of character depth.  I could have started the movie right back at the beginning after finishing it and still enjoyed their performances (as well as excellent auxiliary cast that shines in their respective roles).<br /><br />Thus, though I wasn't expecting all that much when pressing the "Play" button on this one, it instantly jumped into the top ten films I have ever laid eyes on.  PLEASE go out and find this movie somewhere if you consider yourself a movie fan whatsoever.  It will absolutely astound you.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>I can understand casting Kate Winslet (Heavenly Creatures, Sense And Sensibility, Titanic) in a love story, but Jim Carrey (Ace Ventura, Dumb And Dumber, The Truman Show)?? All I could think of was his many years of insane comedic roles. Then, I heard that ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND had a sci-fi angle, and I figured it would have to be a total disaster. I was wrong. Winslet and Carrey's Clementine and Joel are absolutely endearing and believable. They go together like bread and butter, easily convincing me that these damaged characters truly love each other. The whole memory-erasure thing is well done and adds a nice, bizarre twist to the procedings. If you look at my reviews, you'll see very few love stories, but this one is a masterpiece of comedy, romance, and a completely off-kilter atmosphere. If you enjoy movies like SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE or 12 MONKEYS, and a bit of romance doesn't terrify you, then ESOTSM will satisfy. Highest recommendation...</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>I was not a fan of Jim Carrey's until I saw this film. I bought it because Charlie Kaufman wrote the screenplay, and I loved BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, and ADAPTATION. I have, to date, worn out two discs of THE ETERNAL SUNSHINE....<br /><br />The reason I love this movie so much is I've never seen one- ever- that was able to encapsulate with such terrible clarity, and frank eloquence, the nature of love, and ( specifically ) why we love. Though this masterpiece is extremely moving, hysterical, and lethally ascerbic, it is anything but cute.<br /><br />Jim Carrey should have gotten an Oscar for his performance, as the quiet, loner, Joel, and Kate Winslet was equally wonderful. The entire cast was superb, in fact. The direction, and cinematography was great, but the story was genius.<br /><br />Be smart, and get a little Sunshine....</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's reality-bending work has become such a Hollywood staple that he is becoming more distinctive than the directors who give life to his wildly imaginative and solipsistic scripts. He dares to give dramatic form to nebulous psychological states that border on horror stories. Directed by Michel Gondry, this 2004 study in love and loss is no exception, as Kaufman takes the notion of a struggling relationship and inverts it into a manic piece of science fiction involving a medical procedure to scrub one's memory. At the same time, Gondry and Kaufman have injected a strong dose of humanism into this film by grounding it with characters that are relatable as much as they are quirky.<br /><br />The labyrinth plot focuses on shy, taciturn Joel Barish, who is swept off his feet by the raucous, unstable Clementine. Much to his dismay after a particularly ugly fight, he discovers that Clementine has impulsively decided to erase all memory of her relationship with him through a medical company called Lacuna headed by the benevolent Dr. Mierzwiak. A renowned leader in his field of memory erasure, Mierzwiak treats the heartbroken Joel to the same procedure as Clementine's. However, Joel is overcome by the intensity of emotion from this act of reciprocation and starts rebelling against the deep consciousness treatment to regain his memories of Clementine. The surreal twists and turns that occur boggle the mind of the viewer but not in a way that alienates us from Joel's plight.<br /><br />It helps that a sturdy cast has been recruited starting with a surprisingly subdued Jim Carrey as the depressed Joel. This is easily his most effective attempt at a straight dramatic role even though Gondry allows him to provide flashes of his manic personality when appropriate. Displaying no trace of her corseted Britishness as the bedraggled free spirit Clementine, Kate Winslet shows the right level of abandon and leavens it with her natural earthiness. Tom Wilkinson is his usual steady self as the somewhat remorseful Mierzwiak, while his spirited trio of assistants is played with relish by Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood. All three are fine with Dunst particularly affecting toward the end.<br /><br />The looping narrative could have spiraled out of control had it not been for the stellar work by cinematographer Ellen Kuras, production designer Dan Leigh and editor Valdis Oskarsdottir, all combining to bring much-needed fluidity to initially incoherent scenes. The only fly in the ointment is Jon Brion's overly intrusive music. The 2004 DVD has several extras, the best of which is the consistently informative commentary track by Gondry and Kaufman, which helps explain some of the more bizarre plot turns. There are two featurettes - a standard ten-minute making-of short and a fifteen-minute conversation with Gondry and Carrey that borders on banal. Seven minutes of understandably excised scenes are included, as well as a creative music video of The Polyphonic Spree's "Night and Day" and a faux-commercial for Lacuna.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>The premise of this story is quite fresh & original, I think.  Have you ever had a love affair with someone that went bad?  Have you ever wished that you could simply forget about it, so that you would no longer have to endure the pain?  Have you thought that life would be simpler & easier if you could move on without ever having to "look back"?<br /><br />The present film takes that concept & runs with it.  The title is an allusion to Alexander Pope and it refers to the "spotless mind" of someone who has been "wiped clean" of painful memories of love.  Thanx to a new technology, it is at last possible to kiss goodbye your recall of the proverbial "one that got away."<br /><br />Of course, the $60,000 question is:  is this a good thing?  After all, our memories are part of our personality makeup;  they make us who we are.  This is true of both good & bad memories.  Is it not dangerous to try & be selective about what we remember?<br /><br />Such is the outline of the story that this movie addresses.  It ends up being a cross between a Drama and Romantic Comedy (it has some VERY funny scenes).<br /><br />Jim Carrey continues on his quest that he can do more than slapstick comedy, and he does a credible job.  This is a very different role for Kate Winslett.  Normally she portrays characters who are subdued & rational.  In this film, her character is flakey, impulsive and (somehow?) endearing.<br /><br />If you are in the market for a great date movie, this one is worth a look. It is also cathartic for people who have ever entertained the notion that it's better to forget than to remember.</p></br><a href="../users/APOUYO1BEPK22.html">APOUYO1BEPK22</a><br/><p>The first 17 minutes or so of the movie shows Joel (Jim Carrey) waking up...going to work...and then freaking out. He has this sudden urge to rush to Montague (I'm not sure where that's at though). Joel is not the kinda of person that is spontaneous like that. But for some reason...he just has to go to Montague. He gets to a beach and sees a pretty girl in an orange sweater with blue hair. Being shy..he doesnt talk to her. But she notices him. When he is leaving Montague he notices that the girl is on the train with him now. The girl comes over and starts talking to him and introduces herself as Clementine (Kate Winslett). They hit it off and spend the whole day together having a great and wonderful and exciting (especially for Joel) time.<br /><br />Then the title credits start to appear and Joel is crying his eyes out. We come to find out that when he goes into the store where Clementine works, she is completely ignoring him. So Joel is crushed and then his friends let him know what really happened. She erased him. Erased him from her mind. He's gone to her. So he's devastated and wants to do the same to her.<br /><br />And that's when the real movie begins in my opinion. As the doctor begins to erase his memories, Joel is remembering most of them at the same time. So he's witnessing his memories dissapearing right before him. We come to find out that he's had a long relationship with Clementine. One that seemed like it was really fun and had so much love with the occasional arguing that most couples in love have. As Joel is remembering and actually living out these memories again, he realizes he screwed up and he doesn't want to lose Clementine forever. So he tries to wake up but cant. So he does the next best thing... he tries to hide her in memories that she shouldn't belong in. All the while you are sitting and watching their relationship from Joel's memories and you just want to wake him up yourself and send him off to get Clementine back.<br /><br />This is not your typical love story. I found the love that Clementine and Joel share much more believable in this movie. They are opposites from each other. Joel is shy and Clementine is outgoing. Joel makes plans and Clementine is spontaneous. Joel is careful of his actions and Clementine is carefree. They both helped each other out. Clementine would help Joel have more fun in life, while Joel would help Clementine calm down just a tad. Many love stories have the same plot and the same fairy tale feel to it. This one didn't.<br /><br />The reason why I give this movie a 4 and not a 5 is that there were some things in the movie that I just thought were getting in the way. I didn't like Kirsten Dunst's role between her and the main doctor. I thought the way the movie ended was definitley cool, but I still wish I coulda seen more.<br /><br />I think everyone should at least watch this movie once. Especially if you are in love or have been in love.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>It happens to both the best and worst of us at some time in our lives. Love ? If you haven?t experienced this yet just wait, you will. It is inevitable that at some time in our journey through life that we will come across someone that fascinates us so profoundly that we feel as though we could spend the rest of our lives with this magnetic individual. There is no exact science to the concept of love. Many believe that the idea of love goes beyond the reasonable or the logical to a more diverse level of the illogical, irrational, and the unreasonable. Why is it that we find ourselves attracted to people that, on the surface, seem as though they would never be compatible with our own lifestyle? Why is it that when we do fall in love with a certain individual and think at first that this is a perfect match, we find over time that less tolerable marks are more frequent on the surface? And why is it that we overlook some individuals that, although at first there is no real ?love connection? per say, we seem to have a somewhat pure liking for someone and that it takes us longer then it should to see that person for who they really are to us? Love is a complicated subject that can?t be taught, it can only be experienced for what it is ? utterly confusing and yet at the same time completely fulfilling.<br /><br />The story is a twisted and complicated tale from the same man who brought movie-going audiences such award-savvy features as Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. Joel Barish seems like the average, normal guy who stays pretty isolated from communicating his true feelings to others and yet reveals spectacular insight only to the confines of his journal. He doesn?t like going on impulses and gut feelings but rather relies more on common sense and the logical sense of self-direction. That is until he meets Clementine. They flirt with each other and eventually find themselves falling in love with one another ? That is until one day Joel finds out that Clementine has undergone a radical procedure to have him erased from her memory because she was unhappy. So, in an act of self-gratification, Joel decides to undergo the procedure himself, erasing every argument, every embarrassment, every thought he has had involving Clementine. But as the procedure goes on, Joel begins to realize that beyond the quarrels and the less flattering incidents there were beautiful memories that he never wants to forget. So he does the unthinkable ? Joel attempts to outrun the erasers through a dizzying chase through his mind. The story for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is hauntingly brilliant and, in some cases, personally gratifying. The concepts and the feelings expressed behind the script of this film hit so hard to home that it feels as though we our seeing our own love lives played out on screen. Granted Sunshine does tend to veer off into the ridiculously absurd but when evaluating what one takes away from this film, it is pure genius.<br /><br />Quite amazingly this low budgeted independent feature showcases a surprising amount of A-list talent but manages to have those performers express well beyond their famous names. Jim Carrey, who has unsuccessfully attempted to make a mark in drama with lead performances in Man on the Moon and The Majestic, gives a thoroughly convincing and commanding performance in the role of Joel Barish. And Carrey?s performance is only complimented by his interaction with Kate Winslet, who acts opposite of him as Clementine. Though the two give dramatically different personas to their characters and look as if they would never be quite compatible with each other based on surface actions, which is the idea the filmmakers are trying to express. It?s not what is right in front of us that should define a relationship; it is the memories themselves and the experiences of the two individuals. Elijah Wood, in his first role outside the Lord of the Rings franchise which recently wrapped up in December, gives an effective performance as a man one can?t help but despise for his methods of obtaining someone?s affection but at the same time feel pity for his plight, which is that he feels love eludes him. And Kirsten Dunst performs well within the film despite her appearance that protrudes a sense of innocence that feels off-base or awkward that distracts from the actions of her character. Not to say that she doesn?t perform well or that the character is a pointless one, not in the least, but perhaps it is the fact that her innocence, based on her name and the characters she has played, carries a stigma with her role.<br /><br />Overall, Sunshine, as awkward and thoroughly confusing at it may seem and is, manages to express, in the most informal of ways, the feelings and thoughts we should all have when examining a relationship, in that it is not the superficial features but the underlining memories that make it all worth while. When a relationship hits that unfortunate moment where it all seems to be breaking down, we, as human beings, seem to instantly draw ourselves to the negative aspects of that person, as Joel did early in the procedure, in an attempt of sorts to make everything right within our mind. What Eternal Sunshine successfully expresses is that when breaking down the relationship moment by moment, more often then not the happier events outweigh the bad and that should be our determining factor to keep the relationship going. Too many moments are wasted on gut-instincts and logic, when it comes to love one must live every moment for what it is because we only have one shot in this world and we might as well make it worthwhile. What happens if that relationship doesn?t work? You pick yourself up, let the relationship go, and, in time, move on. If you try your best and nothing seems to work in that relationship then perhaps it will never work and you shouldn?t play out a fantasy that you know will never be. We have all experienced moments where we feel as though there is opportunity to ask someone out or express how one feels for a certain individual but have chickened out due to nerves, ?gut-instincts?, or views of superficial matters. Eternal Sunshine promotes the ideology of living within the present and letting the course of the matter play out as it may. If we all relied on nerves and logic, would anyone really fall in love?</p></br><a href="../users/A1KAR9G699RM56.html">A1KAR9G699RM56</a><br/><p>This is a story about love, and the fate of love.  Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) decide to erase their memories of each other, but at the last moment Joel realizes that he wants to save his treasured memories.<br /><br />After that, the whole film revolves around the idea of love that was meant to be.  No it is not perfect love, but it is about two people coming together and enjoying one anthers company.  There are tough times and good times, but only too late do they realize that all memories should be protected.<br /><br />I found this movie to be a highly original telling of not just the traditional love story, but the difficult ones, and the sad ones too.  The actors do a marvelous job of portraying daily life, and the director Michel Gondry, along with Kaufman's script, does a wonderful job of illuminating those everyday moments.<br /><br />I especially liked the idea that things revolve, and return, and are in a sense reborn.  The memory eraser company seems like science on the cutting edge; however, ethical dilemmas and personal endangerment highlight this as a man vs. machine theme too.  Therefore, the movie is not all just about love.  (In fact one of my favorite parts is the internal conflict in the memory erasing business itself.)<br /><br />In summary, if you like artsy, or creative films, with everyday themes then you will really like this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>"Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind" is a great 2004 release starring Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, and others.  This critically acclaimed film shows more of writer Charlie Kaufman's creative mind beyond his past works "Adaptation" and "Being John Malkovich".  Some may consider this his best work.  He stays true to his signature writing style throughout this film.  The unusual events chained to one another surprisingly fit, making this film much more groundbreaking.  The plot of Joel wanting to erase ex-girlfriend Clementine from his mind takes a unique turn.  As it explores the relationship between the two - backwards - the camera graphics deeply reveal the emotions of Joel and Clementine.  Meanwhile, Joel learns his past wrongs.<br /><br />The acting amongst the cast is amazing, namely Carrey and Winslet.  Carrey, as Joel, unbelievably holds back the signature slapstick comedy style and replaces it with his dramatic side.  This style is a big step from his previous dramatic effort "The Majestic".  He could finally receive an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.  Equally emotional in her performance is Winslet as Clementine.  As always, whether she expresses free-spirit or sadness, she shows how great an actress she is.  The rest express their strengths in various scenes, especially Dunst after her character discovers a shocking secret about her own past.<br /><br />Such film quality makes "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" enjoyable for many audiences.  Those pleased with Kaufman's work should also watch his previous works.</p></br><a href="../users/AYZLXLVMJGTJV.html">AYZLXLVMJGTJV</a><br/><p>I like Kate Winslet in this movie. I like her way of talking and her manner. I like that she and Joel both go to places where not many people visit. I like that they visit empty beaches in the winter, ride buses to empty places and eat at restaurants not filled up with lots of people. I like that Joel writes and makes pictures of things. I like that Kirsten's character likes quotes that make a person think and feel. I like Kate's hair colors and styles. I like her differentness. Why would someone want to erase their memories? That is what the movie is kind of about. How they do it and their experience of it while its being done. Do we just throw away the stuff we don't like? Do we embrace it? I prefer to keep mine. They find out that even though they try to control their thoughts which is also their feelings or vice versa it still doesn't really change who they are. They erase their relationship and connection but they do it all over again anyway. Maybe the erasing helped them to grow because they found out about it. And they got back together with that knowledge. I mainly like the places where you go that hold spirit and aloneness, it is nice to share it with another and that was kind of what Clemintine understood and Joel just did. I liked the chinese restaurant, the neat music, the ending song, the connections of the people.</p></br><a href="../users/AMP7TQRWAIE84.html">AMP7TQRWAIE84</a><br/><p>"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" isn't a movie that is gonna be for everyone. It's a little weird with a few quirks thrown in for good measure. It's basically a love story though so if you are into that, then there is a lot here for you to grab onto. Jim Carrey ultimately meets Kate Winslet, who is the most confusing, multifaceted free-spirited woman that Jim's character has never met (until now). They meet on a train and she weirdly introduces herself to him as he acts a bit coy and somewhat defensive. The movie more or less centers around these two's story with side characters getting their small roles sewed in also. I don't wanna spoil anything major for you but the last 15 or so minutes of the movie had me in immense tears for the sheer intensity (this is a love story, after all!).<br /><br />I would recommend anyone who still hasn't seen this wonderful 2004 hit to watch it if you still believe in love! It has a story with plenty of interesting twists and a plot that keeps you on edge in places. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it is now up there with some of my favorite movies of all-time such as "American Beauty" and "The Lion King".<br /><br />Two thumbs way the hell up!<br /><br />5 full stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>The great Albert Camus stated once: "The disgrace of having a good memory is the nostalgia".<br /><br />Our affective and emotional core has its basis in memory. Nostalgia for example, is perhaps the most poetic region of this faculty.<br /><br />So when you have the chance to erase from the memory a bite of it, in a way equivalent to a lobotomy. We are not better, just different. Charlie Kaufman wrote a postmodern fable in which science fiction is the gateway to imagine the possibility of building our memories, beyond the free will. Hence the nostalgia - for me it is a verb rather than a word - makes both decide, despite the errors, and disconnectedness of everyday disagreements correct the helm and give both a second chance.<br /><br />The script is nearly round, with a secondary reading of a noted physician and his beautiful assistant. That line was not sufficiently dramatically developed and its outcome did not quite measure up. Moreover, the conductor thread would have enabled dramatic confront both sides of the coin: rearrangement and impregnable tragedy.<br /><br />Though it would mean not acknowledging that this was perhaps in the most interesting cult film of that year. It's a film that continues to captivate much of the new generations despite the elapsed years.<br /><br />Jim Carrey has never been better in any film. Kate Winslet absolutely convincing in this role of woman-child, and also kudos for Tom Wilkinson and Kirsten Dunst who established a real sexual chemistry with Mark Rufalo.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Charlie Kaufman is known for creating films that bend the mind -- "Being John Malkovich," "Adaptation," "Human Nature." But he takes a slightly different turn in "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," a sort of romantic dark comedy that raises questions about memory and identity. It may not be the best of Kaufman's work, but it's in some ways the most endearing.<br /><br />Uptight Joel (Jim Carrey) is shocked to learn that his likably flaky ex-girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has taken unusual measures, post-breakup. She's having her memories of him erased from her brain at Lacuna Inc. When he learns WHY she broke up with him (she thought he was boring), he gets mad and decides to have the same thing done to himself.<br /><br />So a group of offbeat techies and doctors (Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst) begin to erase the memories of Clementine from Joel's brain (Wood's character also tries to use Joel's memories to seduce Clementine). Problem is, his brain doesn't want to let them go. It pokes Clementine into parts of his memory where she doesn't belong, so he won't have to let go. And viewing the memories makes him fall in love all over again...<br /><br />"Dark romantic comedy" is the closest thing that "Eternal Sunshine" has to a description. Like Kaufman's other films, it's funny in a subtle way, and more obviously sweet and romantic. Not to mention thought-provoking. If you could erase unpleasant memories, would you do it, if it changed the person you were? If we get rid of the pain, do we also get rid of the joy?<br /><br />Michel Gondry is best known for his work on Bjork, Radiohead and White Stripes music videos -- deliciously strange ones. Somehow, he fits perfectly into directing "Eternal Sunshine." A trip through a person's brain is a hard thing to manage, but he does it -- surreal little images like a teeny tiny Winslet and Carrey bathing in a kitchen sink, or lying on the ice. It's weird, and it works. At the same time, he can capture more mundane moments well.<br /><br />Jim Carrey gives what may be his best "serious" role ever, as the conflicted, lovelorn Joel. Kate Winslet's Clementine breaks the mold of "romantic comedy heroine" with her free-spirited wackiness. Together, they make a flawed couple that you really want to see together. And Elijah Wood takes what could have been an empty role and turns Patrick into a rather pitiful, lonely figure, rather than a 2-D creep.<br /><br />As for this blu-ray edition, it's got the basic content -- feature commentary with Gondry and Kaufman, an infomercial for Lacuna, interviews with the actors and director, music videos for the Polyphonic Spree, scene analyses, a featurette about Gondry. And for the blu-ray, it has "My Scenes" that lets you bookmark scenes, and "Pocket Blu" which communicates with some devices.<br /><br />"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is not the best from Charlie Kaufman's fertile brain, but this melancholy dark comedy is well worth checking out. A wonderful, prismatic film.</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind DVD Review<br />2 Disc Collector's Edition (2004)<br /><br />This is an almost a perfect movie for me.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was directed by Michel Gondry who also wrote it along with Charlie Kaufman and Pierre Bismuth. I want to live in this man's head for a day, his brilliance and creativity and ingenuity with limited resources was inspiring and gripping to say the least. This is a different kind of love story, beginning at the end and ending at the beginning. Joel played by Jim Carrey and Clementine played by Kate Winslet are a couple who have had their ups and downs like anyone else. During this latest down, Joel goes to a specialist to have his memories of Clementine erased after he finds out she did the same for him. As he drifts though the memories, he finds he doesn't want to forget because he still loves her.<br /><br />Jim Carrey took a turn for the dramatic here. One of his first scenes is really balling his eyes out in the car in utter anguish. It hits you right in the gut when you realize you can empathize with that emotion of being at bottom and that this normally comedic actor strikes right to your core. This character is so different from his other roles. He's shy, awkward, inhibited for once, angry, and heart-broken.<br /><br />Kate Winslet is one of my favorite actresses. Her Clementine is real, quirky, charismatic, impulsive, and moody. She is the outgoing one instead of Jim Carrey and carries many of the comedic moments. Her unique rainbow of hair colors really displays her personality to the world.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Tom Wilkinson plays Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, inventor of the process of erasing memories. His employees include his receptionist, Mary played by Kirsten Dunst who admires him and secretly loves him, field worker Stan played by Mark Ruffalo who is in love with Mary and has a relationship with her, and another field worker, Patrick played by Elijiah Wood. Elijiah Wood plays an uncharacteristically creepy role here (this was before Sin City, mind you) who falls in love with Clementine during the memory erasure and uses Joel's memories to woe her. It's a very complicated layering of love triangles and while the storyline of the memory clinic workers is linear, the story of Joel and Clementine is backward through Joel's eyes.<br /><br />It's amazing how memories of a person are just moments in time that you experience with them, good or bad and they can be very random or very special. Since it's all within the mind, there's a lot of jumping around and fuzziness, especially as Joel tries to find ways to outwit the process. It's also one of those movies where you actually notice how good the music is, I got the soundtrack afterward. The love themes and the "Elephant Parade" track are especially moving. This movie will stick with you emotionally, the last scenes always bring tears to my eyes. It also takes you on a thrill ride that will open up your mind and keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering if he will succeed.<br /><br />DVD Extras:<br /><br />There is director & writer commentary and there are conversations with the director alone, with Jim Carrey, and with Kate Winslet as they dissect characters and talk about how certain effects were done. It's amazing how simple some things were and how many ideas the director had, many that never even were used! One example is during one memory of an argument with Clementine, Joel is walking away and she becomes blurry while he does not. There were a pair of grips walking behind with a frosted glass pane to achieve the effect. In another scene, Clementine is leaving the apartment and she goes into one room and then appears in another and then appears by the front door. This was achieved with trapdoors and at the last second, a body double! Very smart, very simple. In one scene taken in one shot, Jim Carrey had to play Joel in the doorway and then Joel sitting in a chair in the room so he kept running behind the camera and putting his hat on and off till they got it. Some deleted scenes show more dreamy out-of-sequence events and odd situations with Clementine and Joel trying to evade the memory erasers. They give just a little more activity for the characters and illustrate the genius of the director. A Polyphonic Spree Music video is on Disc 1 and you'll either love it or hate it. It's a very sunny song that will make you jump around the room or groan in disgust depending on your frame of mind. I really enjoyed the Lacuna Commercial also on Disc 1 showing how the memory erasing could be advertised by the company, it's pretty amusing and disturbing at the same time. One of my favorite bits would be the Anatomy of a Scene bonus feature on Disc 2 where they take the major fight scene where cars and things are falling from the sky in the memory and breakdown how it was done in layers, how things were added, until the final product developed. One last thing, this DVD comes with a Souvenir booklet that mainly has quotes from critics about how special and unique they felt the movie was along with many production still photos.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>When you hear the basic storyline of "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," it sounds like another one of those "wacky" romantic comedies that they love to put out every month.  However, when you realize that this is written by Charlie Kaufman (who also wrote "Adaptation" and "Being John Malkovich"), then you know that this will be a very different movie.  This is such an enjoyable, hilarious and a brutally honest film that has immediately become a favorite of mine.<br /><br />Jim Carrey plays "Joel;" a quiet and shy person who keeps to himself most of the time.  He's bummed out when he discovers that his girlfriend had a new procedure done in where she has erased him from her memory.  Not knowing what else to do, Joel decides that he must get the same thing done to him and goes to the clinic to have her erased from his memory, hoping that the pain and sadness will go away.  When he's undergoing the procedure, unconscious and reliving the memories as they are being erased, Joel begins to realize that there were some very happy moments he had with her and he doesn't want to lose them after all.<br /><br />It's really hard to categorize a movie like this.  While it is indeed a comedy on some levels, it has a lot of dramatic elements to it, as well.  Because of this, people will either fall in love with it or despise every minute of it.  What really struck home with me is how honest and creative it really is.  You'll find a lot more honesty and truth in "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" than in most of the "cute" comedies that are out there today.  It is extremely easy to relate to the characters, and that is what makes it all the more realistic for us.  Jim Carrey is absolutely fantastic in this, as he is very controlled and doesn't try to steal the show.  This is when you really get to see his acting skills shine.  Kate Winslet takes the challenge of playing opposite of Carrey head-on and succeeds every single time.  We cannot forget about Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkinson, who also make the movie that much more entertaining.<br /><br />What I really admire about the movie is the theme of it, and that is that just because a relationship doesn't work out in the end, it doesn't mean that it was time wasted.  Sure, there are certain memories we wish would go away somehow, but how would that change us as a person if we could do such a thing?  We learn from our experiences; from the good and the bad.  That's how we mature as human-beings, and Kaufman's clever writing really establishes that perfectly.  The DVD has some cool extras, such as behind-the-scenes documentaries, audio commentary from the writer and the director, deleted scenes and more.<br /><br />"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" remains the best film to come out of 2004 for me.  It's strange, yet clever; funny yet sad, and imaginative, yet honest.  If you're looking for a risk-taking film that is like a breath of fresh air, then I highly recommend this excellent picture.  This can possibly be the best movie of Jim Carrey's career.  Take a chance and find out why so many people are raving about it in the first place. -Michael Crane</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND, which I saw tonight in an advance screening, is the most twisted, original romantic comedy I've seen in a long time. Coming from the mind of Charlie Kaufman, this film is luckily more in the vein of BEING JOHN MALKOVICH and ADAPTATION than HUMAN NATURE.<p>The film, which operates on the premise that people can delete bad relationships from their memories, travels essentially backward down its story's timeline. It examines several key themes regarding compatibility, fate and how our memories can make up who we are. <p>Jim Carrey, who plays his role of Joel straight rather than wacky, delivers his best and most human performance since THE TRUMAN SHOW. But the movie, thankfully, belongs to Kate Winslet. As Clementine, the girlfriend who Joel wants to either love or forget, Winslet is wacky, colorful and hilarious - the sort of girl you want to either love or strangle.<p>While their central story plays out mostly within Joel's brain, several equally interesting subplots emerge involving the memory-erasing workers played by Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson. <p>The thing I like best about Charlie Kaufman scripts is that I don't always know where they're going but, in the end, they cover all their bases, address all the philosophical questions inherent in their twisted plots and always leave me entertained. ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is a terrific movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>In every script that Charlie Kaufman writes there always seems to be a very twisted mind game as the premise; and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is no exception. Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) and Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) have just gone through a messy break up. Clementine, being rather impulsive (to say the least), undergoes a pseudo medical treatment to erase all memories of Joel Barish, so she can get on with her life. Joel discovers what she has done and opts for the same treatment. Somehow, in sifting through their memories, they rediscover what made them fall in love in the first place. Herein lays the twisted mind game that Kaufman is so fond of. Joel and Clementine must battle the memory erasers to hold onto each other, and the battle royale is all taking place inside Joel's head.<br /><br />Kaufman is aided and abetted here by director Michel Gondry -- a visual genius. He realizes Kaufman's vision with a variety of special effects, like forced perspective and stop action. Nothing computer generated here, it is all done with clever manipulation of the camera. Michel has really brought Charlie's nutso ideas to life, and no matter how far fetched, it all has the gritty look and feel of reality.<br /><br />In a role reversal, you could say that Kate Winslet is playing the Jim Carrey part, while Jim is rather reserved and understated -- the usual sort of Winslet role. Joel, always with three days of stubble on his face, pours his feelings into a diary and whimsical sketches rather than blabbing them out loud. Joel Barish is a projection of Charlie Kaufman, and I can really see him in Jim Carrey's introverted character creation. Who issued the restraining order?<br /><br />There is also a lot of underground cartoonist Robert Crumb in Barish, and some of the scenes where Joel is reliving his childhood could have been lifted directly from Crumb's comic book memoirs. Joel is reading an R. Crumb comic in one scene.<br /><br />-------------<br />Clementine: What are you, NUTS?<br />Joel: It's been suggested.<br />=====================<br /><br />But Joel keeps all his craziness locked inside, whereas Clementine spills it out for all to see. She dyes her hair crazy colors, like Blue Ruin or Agent Orange, and it all matches her clothes -- and the drinks she mixes. She is high maintenance to the max, and she tells him so in no uncertain terms. Soon after meeting she has Joel breaking and entering.<br /><br />---------<br />Clementine: Look, I'm sorry if I came off a little nutso, I'm not really.<br />Joel: That's okay; I really didn't think you were.<br />===================<br /><br />Joel is always very polite and nice, and nice is something that Clementine hates -- or at least she thinks she does, until Joel starts to grow on her. Clementine pushes Joel to experience life to the fullest, to get out of his shell. Clementine has Joel out on thin ice -- figuratively and literally. They are laying together out on the frozen River Charles, a central metaphor of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.<br /><br />------------------------------------<br />Joel: I could die right now, Clem. I'm just... happy. I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where I want to be.<br />=============================================<br /><br />Carrey and Winslet make a great team, with Carrey letting Winslet carry the film, while Jim is the anchor. Kate Winslet is spectacular here. I enjoyed her here much more than watching her go down on the Titanic.<br /><br />Also contributing to the success of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind were Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood as Stan and Patrick, the technicians who perform the memory erasing procedure; Tom Wilkinson as Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, the inventor of the technique; and Kirsten Dunst as Mary the receptionist.

Nothing you'll miss.<br />================================<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is also on a par with a night of heavy drinking -- just as much fun but without the hangover, regrets, or DUIs. Though the plot is convoluted, the viewer should have no problem following it. The visual story telling style of director Michel Gondry really pulls you in. Repeated viewings will no doubt reward with additional revelations. Kate Winslet, Jim Carrey, and the rest of the cast really give it their all. It is a very funny film that also has a lot to say about the nature of love, memory, and how much we need each other, even if we are all a little crazy.<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br />Clementine: You know me, I'm impulsive.<br />Joel: That's what I love about you.<br />==================================================<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P3SA8K">Synecdoche New York</a> (2008) (written by Charlie Kaufman)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PPLJIQ">The Reader</a> (2008) ....

I've come to expect excellence from Charlie Kaufman, who always makes seemingly unfilmable plots into a brilliant screenplay.  Michel Gondry, who directed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000714E6">Human Nature</a>, directs with sensitivity and ambition, making the visual effects of memories being lost look realistic.  The casting choices were unusual but perfect, allowing a group of talented actors to step out of their comfort zones and show how good they truly are.  The leads, Jim Carey and Kate Winslet, are perfectly chosen.  Carey plays the quiet, intelligent, Kaufman-like guy who doesn't know how to interact with others with Winslet playing the arty, rough, daring girl who opens up his world and shatters it down the road with an impulsive decision.  The supporting cast, Kirsten Dunst speficially, also give wonderful performances.  Such great work was put into this from all ends, and the result was a truly wonderful film.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that "Eternal Sunshine" is as brilliant as Kaufman's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLRE">Adaptation</a>, but it is more universal.  I'm partial to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLRE">Adaptation</a> because, as a screenwriter myself, the way Kaufman delves into that pain and longing and frustration a writer experiences rang so true to me, whereas "Eternal Sunshine" is a film that is not really specific to anyone.  It's about love, what people mean to each other, how deeply the memories we have effect us, and even destiny.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be intrigued, and you'll certainly leave the film with the intention to see it again.  A great movie.<br /><br />9/10</p></br><a href="../users/AGQY11NLQJ2JL.html">AGQY11NLQJ2JL</a><br/><p>What an intriguing idea for a story, a man and woman meet, fall in love, fall out of love, have their memories of the whole love experience erased from their memories by a reverse brain mapping process.  Who among us would not jump at the possibility of erasing painful or unpleasant memories and then be able move on with our lives with no recollection of anything associated with the person we had wiped from our memory.<br /><br />The lead characters in the story Joel and Clementine meet and fall and love, but after a period of few years they have drifted apart.  Clementine discovers a doctor, who offers a service where he can erase memories of a particular person from your mind.  Part of the process of forgetting is remembering.  In order to map all the areas of the brain where the memories reside; the person wanting to forget has to collect all items associated with the person they are trying to forget.  These items are shown to the individual, who is trying to forget and as they view the object a map of brain's reaction to the stimulus is created.  Through the marvel of modern science this brain map is then used to execute a pinpoint destruction of the memories.  Clementine successfully undergoes this procedure and completely erases any memories of Joel.  Presumably, she is now free of the pain of a failed relationship.  Joel is now a complete stranger to Clementine.<br /><br />Later, Joel is told by a friend that Clementine has had all memories of him erased and he becomes interested in doing the same with his memories of Clementine.  We are then treated to the spectacle of Joel having all memories of Clementine zapped.  The erasing is done while Joel is sleeping and the "technicians" drink, party and mess around during the process, in a startling display of indifference to what is being done to this person.  Perhaps this is an indictment against the medical community that treats our mental anguish and discomfort with drugs or other means with a sort of detachment from what other damage may be inflicted on the individual.<br /><br />As we watch Joel's memories disappearing, through the use of clever cinematographic techniques, we see that Joel is desperately trying to keep the memories that are being removed.  Other memories from his childhood become more vivid and we can clearly see that all his memories work together to create the person that is Joel.  That is, I think, the precautionary tale of this film.  We can not as humans selectively erase bad or painful memories from our minds without having an impact on our overall psyche.  We may lose some pain, but we may also give up a piece of our soul or our being when we try to block out the bad and keep only the good.  Our memories are complex and twisted and tied together in ways we do not fully comprehend, so be careful when you hit the erase button and enjoy the movie it will create its own map</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>This movie could really have a genre all its own. It really is a mind bender, but not in a way that's difficult to understand. When Joal's spontaneous girlfriend decides to specifically erase memories of him after a break up, she sets off a whacky chain of events. Though science thinks it's found a way to erase painful memories, the couple discovers that maybe memories are best left alone, even if they're bad. Though the film is a drama, there is some humor thrown in. A great watch for those looking for something 'different'.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>Jim Carrey (Lemony Snickets, Bruce Almighty, Truman Show) plays Joel Barish who finds out this his girlfriend Clementine, played by Kate Winslet (Finding Neverland, Titanic, Jude), erased her memories of him and her. Soon after, he realizes he should do it and he signs himself up. After awhile he realizes he doesnt want to lose her so he tries, in his mind to hide her so she cant be erased. A bizarre and mind warping experience that is fun and emotional and everything else. Carrey gives probably so far the best performance of his career and Winslet is beautiful and simply a marvel...the other cast are amazing as well...Mark Ruffalo (Collateral, My Life Without Me, In The Cut) and Elijah Wood (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, Ash Wednesday) play the mind eraser guys...Kirsten Dunst (Spider-man 1 and 2, Interview With The Vampire) plays the secretary to the doctor that was the creator of the erasing minds project, played by Tom Wilkinson (Rush Hour, The Patriot, In The Bedroom). It pulls you in from the beginning and then it brings you for a wild and unforgettable ride. Charlie Kaufman proves he is a genius when it comes to writing original and clever stories...he proved it with both Being John Malkovich and Adaptation and now he's done it again here. Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is a masterwork and will remain one in my mind. Also starring David Cross (Men In Black 1 and 2, Run Ronnie Run) and Jane Adams (Anniversary Party, Lemony Snickets). "Two Thumbs Way Way Up" for me</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is in essence, a simple movie, but a movie that touches on so many relateable feelings and deep and deeper emotions, that it crosses the line into greatness.<br /><br />So far, this is my favorite movie of the year and should, most certainly, be a frequently uttered movie on Oscar night.<br /><br />Who are we? What makes us who we are? Would we be where we are in our lives without ALL of the experiences we have enjoyed or despised. If we took away the bad things, would we be the same people?<br /><br />ETERNAL SUNSHINE is brilliantly played by JIM CARREY and KATE WINSLET. Funny. Charming. Emotional. NORMAL. And when I say 'NORMAL', I mean that for the first time in a long time, we finally have a movie that plays and sounds REAL. The dialogue is FANTASTIC!! THIS is the way people talk. THIS is the way real relationships are. When Kate and Jim talk, you believe, and you instantly feel their connection. At different times in their lives, their conversations are more entertwined.<br /><br />Charlie Kaufman... OSCAR for Best screenplay!<br /><br />I won't say anything more. Don't want to give anything away and ruin it for people who haven't seen.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>This movie is definitely something new; it was produced by Focus Features, which tends to focus on films that are very anti-Hollywood in the sense that they are definitely not for everyone.  This film, along with Lost in Translation (another Focus movie), appeal to certain people, while others may not understand the content or simply find it boring.  This film also requires the viewer to think, which is a trait that many big studio films severely lack lately.<br /><br />The story centers around Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), a quiet introvert who, while constantly making negative observations toward the world, never does anything to better his situation in life.  That is until one day, for no reason at all, he skips out on work and goes to the beach, despite the fact that it's February.  While there, he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet), who is Joel's polar opposite.  She's a free spirit with a bit of a drinking problem, and she and Joel fall in love.  After a messy relationship, Clem decides to have her memories of Joel erased.  Joel finds about this, and, out of a combination of depression and suppressed rage, he decides to have her erased from his memories.  He goes to this clinic run by a Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) and his unprofessional staff.  While his staffers Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Patrick (Elijah Wood), and Mary (Kirsten Dunst) get drunk, stoned, and naked while working on Joel, he subconsciously decides that he no longer wants to erase her after he is forced to remember all the good memories he made with Clementine.  He then proceeds to "hide" his mental Clem in other memories where she doesn't belong, which creates some pretty funny results.<br /><br />For such a difficult concept, writer Charlie Kauffman did a very good job keeping things from getting too confusing.  Not only that, but he was also able to create a great twist to the whole thing.<br /><br />As I said earlier, this movie is not for everyone.  I did like it, but it was bizzare and a little trippy in some places.  This will make a very good rental, especially if you are unsure as to whether or not you will like it.</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>i had no intention of buying this dvd when i went for aladdin, and fahrenheit 9/11. after reading all these great reviews from dvd folks like myself, i was drawn to it, got it watched it asap after i got home. and was whoa just whats going on here?! i was confused but somewhat moved. today i popped it in my system, and aahh now i see where the whole thing was coming from right from the start!  mr. kaufman you are genius, sir!  no less brilliant, however, are jim carrey and kate winslet in the lead roles and truly the best of their careers to date! the superlative supporting cast, ms. dunst, mr. ruffalo, mr. wood, and tom wilkinson all played their parts so realistically, today i was glued to the screen. it is a masterpiece so beautifully constructed  it's rather hard to explain. in short, i love this film-it owns me now, so thanks dear fellow dvd people here-i am grateful.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AMVA4R3G58TV.html">A1AMVA4R3G58TV</a><br/><p>I enjoyed "Enternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind". Jim Carrey is wonderful in the lead role. And Kate Winslet is also really good in it.<br />  The story itself is very interesting, but somewhat complicated.<br />Its kind of a Science-Fiction-Love Story. And you have to be really willing to suspend belief. Its not realistic at all and you really have to pay attention to the story line.<br />  It is a very different kind of movie. But still very enjoyable.<br />And the acting performances are outstanding.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>This is definitly one of the best films that I've seen all year! Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet give superb performances as do the rest of the cast. This was a very thought-provoking and sweet film, one that I would definitly recommend watching with the one you love. Charlie Kaufman has written another awesome script that has been flawlessly directed by Micheal Gondry. This is also a chance to see Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood in what may be the most bizarre roles of their career! <p>Some people may be a bit freaked out by how unconventional this film is. Don't worry, everything pretty much comes together in the end, and trying to figure it all out is just part of the fun! (...) <p>All in all, a great film, and Jim and Kate deserve Oscar nods.<p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>STORY: This is not your average love story, this is love explained simply through the mind of Charlie Kaufman.  If you've never seen a film writing by Kaufman I suggest you see it, if you have you should have been first in line.  What makes this story so unique is the fact that the premise is very simple.  You have a socially isolated man and a woman who is the complete opposite and they have a connection only to be lost in the midst of their every day lives.  When Joel Barish gets his memory erased from her is how the story is told.  We see all the memories they have had together through the erasing of his memory.  Now the audience embarks and a journey of dark and symbolic images that could only come from Kaufman.  The story is so simple yet so powerful that it's very hard to explain the meaning of each image that the film evokes.  The movie is a visionary masterpiece that will evoke emotion from the audience and leave a lasting impact.<p>ACTING: This is Jim Carrey's most emotional and stunning performance.  I really hope he gets nominated for this come Oscar time, but with the movie opening so early that is highly unlikely.  Kate Winslet is fabulous as well, as a matter of fact the entire cast was sensational.  The only rotten egg here was Kirsten Dunst.  I felt that her performance was too forced, too blocky if you know what I mean.  I mean, you really got the impression that she was acting, and that shouldn't be.  An actor's performance should flow to a point where he or she is the character, and I felt Dunst was just trying too hard...</p></br><a href="../users/AFJFXN42RZ3G2.html">AFJFXN42RZ3G2</a><br/><p>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotles Mind is one of the most refreshing movies I've seen this year.  Charlie Kaufman's screenplay, Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, and the supporting cast of Tom Wilkerson, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, and Mark Ruffalo all contribute to the wackiness and the thought provoking aspects of the film.  It was definitely a laugh a minute, and extremely zany.<p>The film has been raved as a romantic comedy, but it appears something more than that.  It follows the basic premise of boy meets girl, and then boy loses girl.  However, there are also complications with the characters in the film, and the experiences they face.  In the end their secrets, or the secrets they did not know about are revealed.  <p>So, check this film out to now and laugh your socks off.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>If by some chance you don't know the basic premise, here it is:  Lacuna Inc has invented a process whereby a person can have their painful memories simply "erased" right from their brains.  Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have gone through a painful breakup, and when Carrey discovers Winslet has undergone the procedure, this torments him to the point where he asks to undergo it himself.<p>It almost sounds a little like a sci-fi movie, doesn't it.  But the "technical" elements are REALLY low-tech.  Lacuna Inc (founded by Tom Wilkinson, the brilliant older actor who was so great in IN THE BEDROOM) is located in a shabby office that looks more like it might belong to a second-rate veterinarian or dentist than a cutting-edge innovator.  That little element tells us three things:  1)  the movie was low-budget, 2) it's creators had the humor and good-sense to use the low-budget to their advantage, and 3) Lacuna's process maybe ain't all it's cracked up to be.<p>Charles Kaufman wrote the script (he's the genius behind ADAPTATION and BEING JOHN MALKOVICH), so we know we are NOT in for a linear story.  But I found SUNSHINE to be easier to follow.  Basically, we see Carrey's memories being erased from the most recent to the oldest.  So we start with the crumbling end of the relationship and work backwards to the sweet beginnings.  <p>Somewhere along the way, Carrey decides he doesn't really care to lose these memories, and tries various tricks to "hide" from the erasers.  These moments, which take us on some flights of fancy, are among the most fun in the movie...such as when Carrey escapes with Winslet (or at least the Winslet of  his memories) to his childhood, where he is able to enjoy the simple pleasures of being a baby again...like taking a bath in the sink!  It's the only time of the movie where Carrey breaks into some of his more antic physical work (a la Ace Ventura), but it totally fits the plot and isn't remotely distracting.  Carrey is utterly self-effacing in the movie, and it doesn't feel like a gimmic.  It isn't a "look at me, I'm underplaying!"...it is a fully fleshed out character and Carrey is really good.<p>Winslet is one of my favorite actors and she doesn't disappoint here.  She is a delightful ball of quirky energy.  She is a performer who holds nothing back and has no vanity.  I think this plays well with Carrey, another performer who doesn't hold back.  But it seems to make him feel comfortable with NOT being obnoxious.  And we don't have any phony moments from him, as we sometimes got in THE TRUMAN SHOW. He is finally just ACTING...not "putting on a show." Winslet, I think, makes this possible.<p>The other plot(s) involve the employees of Lacuna.  Mark Ruffalo (endearing) and Elijah Wood (obnoxious) are the two programmers / operators, who come into Carrey's house to erase the memories.  Kirsten Dunst is the administrative assistant in the office, and she's having a fling with Ruffalo.  I won't tell you what Wood is up to...suffice it to see that his character is a little less admirable than Frodo!! All three performers are good, and along with Wilkinson, we've got 6 REALLY solid performances.<p>The film fails to get the full 5 stars (I give it 4.33 out of 5) for two reasons:  1)  Dunst's character does some things near the end of the film which aren't totally believable...they feel just a little like a plot device to make the ending possible.  2)  We see a lot of the end of the Carrey / Winslet relationship, and a lot of the beginning.  Where was the middle?  The "we're very comfortable together, but the passion is abated, but we aren't sick of each other yet" phase.  The movie does such a great job of making us feel the pain / pleasure of love, that I really missed seeing it explore this part of the whole "romance" thing.<p>But, nit-picking aside, I highly recommend this original, touching, sometimes hilarious but always fresh movie.  For adults who've had relationships.  Not for kids.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q4XAQXKKV6V.html">A3Q4XAQXKKV6V</a><br/><p>The leads in this and the story is pretty fantastic. But, for me, it was simply impossible to look beyond the rather awful sub-plot with the 'doctor' and the 'blonde'. Not to mention the supporting cast which was totally overshadowed by the leads. I loved the unusual soundtrack and of course the camera work was surreal. Still there was just enough wrong with this to lop off the fifth star. Jim Carey truly is a good actor and I am relieved to see him take chances like this. He seemed to play this role a bit close to the vest but he was still a marvel to watch. I highly reccommend this to those who love to think, I think you'll love it. My final critique is, I wish the story could have been told via using a different vehicle, thus removing the sub-plot characters; comas, longing, anything would have been better than the process used in the film.</p></br><a href="../users/AFJFXN42RZ3G2.html">AFJFXN42RZ3G2</a><br/><p>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is definitely one of those gems of a movie that makes sense despite its twists and turns.  I'm not sure if this is a representation of the continuing wave of independent films with big name stars, such as last year's Lost In Translation, but it certainly was worth watching.  It's one of those films that has a natural ambience.<p>The film does not follow the mundane plotlines as most Romantic comedies.  Of course, in the beginning just when you think it's going to be one of those boy meets girl, boy loses girl scenarios, Charlie Kaufman, Eternal Sunshine's screenwriter pulls a curve ball.  The relationship between Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) appear complicated, and indeed it is.  But somehow Kaufman ties it all together in the end.  This film is about identity and memory, and coming to terms with the past in order to tie loose ends that exist in the present.<p>The most uncanny aspect of the film is the appearance of opening credits 15-20 minutes into the movie!  The film almost has a 'Magical Mystery Tour' feel -- the beginning starts off predictable, then suddenly half-way through the film you're hit with a warp sense of Joel's memory and experiences, and then the concluding scenes lends itself to an additional plotline somewhat relevant to the relationship between Joel and Clementine, which involves LacUna, the company that erases both Joel and Clementine's memories.  Unfortunately, it is the weak portion of the film.  <p>The cinematography was effective in portraying the fast paced parts of the film as well as the overexposed photography -- it gave that indie feel as well as the surreal-like effects.  In addition, I found the soundtrack of the film to be quite interesting.  At times I thought one of the opening chords or sound effects came from Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, or maybe fragments of The Beatles' A Day In A Life.  I was disappointed that ELO's Mr. Blue Sky wasn't present in the film, but then again it only appeared in the film's trailer.<p>Nevertheless, I recommend this film to anyone interested in catching a movie that's fresh and unpredictable.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MQQI4UYT9C11.html">A2MQQI4UYT9C11</a><br/><p>"Eternal Sunshine" was my favorite film of 2004, and one of my all-time favorites.  Given that Jim Carrey starred, that's quite a tribute to both him and the rest of the people (screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and director Michel Gondry in particular) involved with this delightful and imaginative project.  Both Carrey and co-star Kate Winslet play skillfully against type--he shy and introverted; she way off-beat.  Their trip through mind and memory takes awhile to get used to--like eyes adjusting to a darkened room, but it's full of wonderful surprises once you get used to the view.  Other treats include Elijah Wood (Frodo) role as junior memory erasure technician and Kirsten Dunst (Spiderman's girlfriend) quoting "Pope Alexander's" poem that gives the film its title.  My strongest recommendation--as long as you can handle a little (well a lot) of time shifting.</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>I was caught off guard by this movie. I was moved to buy it. I was hit blindside by a train.<br /><br />This movie pulls off what most modern movies don't: characters you actually care about, and want to learn move about. Carrey is stunning, and Winslet pulls off her "easy to love and hate at the same time" multi-colored hair troubled woman with an amazing performance. I fell in love with Carrey and Winslet. I wanted a happy ending, and received one. No cheesy Hollywood love storie here. No cookie cutter script. Just acting that leaves you in tears.<br /><br />Brilliant. Rent it, and then buy it. While I was not a fan of Being John Malkovich, or Adaptation, because of their dry cardboard characters, this movie flies to the other end of the character spectrum and sets a wonderful standard.<br /><br />This movie leaves you yearning to jump into the film. There is no greater compliment than this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>There is much to recommend the movie. The plot is simple: boy meets girl. How the movie tells the story is complicated. The plot line folds in on itself. It reveals bits and pieces of the relationship slowly and sometimes you have to put a piece somewhere else than where you originally placed it in the jigsaw puzzle of their relationship. This makes the movie interesting to watch. In this respect it is like "Memento." Carey and the other actors do a good job. Carey plays a lonely loner in this movie very well.<br /><br />The plot device is the memory erase. A doctor comes up with a method to erase all memories of a relationship. What the movie points out very well,using Carey's relationships and subplots, is that memories of even bad relationships should be valued and erasing memories does not really solve any thing in your life.<br /><br />I did not give the movie five stars because I was not engaged in the relationship. There is an emotional center in the movie, but it really did not interest me. I could care less whether Carey's character and Winslett's character have a successful relationship. Maybe it is just me, but you see much of the bad parts of the relationship before you see the good so it is hard to be a cheerleader for this relationship to work.<br /><br />I recommend the movie; however, it did not overwhelm me. Maybe I expected too much, because I liked the director's other works so much.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>Well, I finally got to see this one and I am kicking myself that it took me so long to get around to it.

I can't even describe how this film finally changed my opion of him.  Winslet is like a piece of of eternal sunshine, Dunst, Ruffalo, et al. are each excellent.  This movie is funny, moving, suspenseful and romantic all in one. Beautifully filmed and with a great score, I can't recommended this one enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DWUM6SN3N3NR.html">A3DWUM6SN3N3NR</a><br/><p>visually very impressive and thoroughly captivating. At times stirring and very moving performances. Somewhat interesting and thought-provoking, but maddening story-line that almost left me with a headache: (scenes like the two young lovers dancing atop his body while he is undergoing "the procedure" truly required a massive stretch of the imagination - despite the joy of seeing Kirsten in action!)<br /><br />Definitely requires a suspension of belief and a real open-mindedness to visionary cinema. It's a unique film that's worth a look, for sure.</p></br><a href="../users/A17JVVAKWEB0M.html">A17JVVAKWEB0M</a><br/><p>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind begins with the theory that memory is a tangible thing. The brain is the equivalent of a large filing cabinet, and the removal of painful memories is as simple as isolating the files associated with the person or event and taking them out. Described as a form of brain damage, the procedure is quick and efficient, as troubled patients are promised a future free of those troubling episodes that haunt us all.<br /><br />But that only establishes the world of the film. The plot involves the question of what happens when two former lovers both choose to erase each other from their memories and then meet again without any knowledge of their previous relationship. The film goes on to explore questions about true love and how much a person's identity depends on his/her memory.<br /><br />The two lovers in the film as played by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, and neither have been better. Carrey is reserved and introverted, a reminder of other Charlie Kaufman-created leads in Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. He is witty, educated, but painfully inept in social settings. As opposites attract, his love interest is all the things he is not. She is spontaneous and lively, but lacks much mystery and depth.<br /><br />The film begins in the middle, before they meet again "for the first time". We see their previous relationship in flashbacks, most of the film taking place in Carrey's mind as he goes through his memory erasing procedure. While in the middle of the process, conflict arises in his mind. A heartbreaking realization ensues, as he must give up the tender moments of their affair (along with the painful ones). The horror of the procedure is exposed; it is the equivalent of the death of a loved one.<br /><br />While watching them build their relationship a second time, many viewers will be torn. Some will say it is the power of true love, thrusting them back together as if they are destined for each other. Others will believe they are making the same mistake again and will not want them to suffer through another courtship that ended as badly as the first.<br /><br />At the heart of the film is a relationship between two people presented with all the cruel truths of reality. While we do see the wonderful moments shared by two people in love, we also see how painful love can be when those involve really know what how to hurt their partner. The film offers ambiguous answers to the matters of the heart, but succeeds in presenting a story and world that should stimulate imaginations and spark debate.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VJ7HYM1EC94M.html">A1VJ7HYM1EC94M</a><br/><p>A fascinating early 21st century fable and one of the most beautiful American movies to come along in ages. Michael Gondry is blessed with a cast that seems to have trusted his direction and was equally responsive to every idea presented, and fearless executing every moment.<br /><br />Jim Carrey is offered his best role to date and he not only doesn't disappointment he proves himself to be me more than clownish cartoon characters he too frequently (and easily) settles into.  It is a remarkably affecting and touching performance.<br /><br />Kate Winslet is once again the chameleon and her Clementine while initially straightforward and uncomplicated beguilingly shows how many facets this character has behind her.  It's a fascinating portrait.<br /><br />The remainder of the ensemble, the art direction, sound and every other aspect of this movie set a standard for the new century.  I hope we're up to it!</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is as original and fascinating as anything Charlie Kaufman has written previously. Kaufman has the ability to take a tiny thought/idea and trace it through the minds of his characters much like the way synapses propel sensory input.  And in doing so he provides more intelligent insights about personality variations and relationships and the vulnerability and neediness of contemporary man than just about any person writing scripts today.  This is 21st Century existentialism delivered in the most cogent manner.<br /><br />But the story would be only half told were it not for director Michel Gondry and his enormously gifted cast of characters:  Jim Carrey finally demonstrates his innate thespian gifts with the role of Joel, a laid back, fearful, needy cookie-cutter piece of a man who finally finds someone who loves him in goofy Clementine (the always superb Kate Winslet) only to have the 'business' of memory erasing (run by Dr. Miarzwiak - Tom Wilkinson - assisted by his technicians Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood) destroy his new found happiness and drive him to the same extreme that drove Clementine to have their memories of each other erased.  Despite the apparent linear storyline this film begins to act like the confusion of electrical stimuli to brain cells and for the remainder of the the movie we are not sure how the idea is playing out until the magic ending which is so fine that it should be withheld from those who have not experienced this film.  This is cinema of the first rank, up there in the echelon of Resnais, Fellini, Almodovar and others who have been practitioneers of the bizarre yet wholly committed art of mind manipulation.  This film may take some work from you, may require a couple of watchings, but it is time well spent.  Let's hope there are more collaborations between Kaufman and Gondry - and even this cast - in the future!</p></br><a href="../users/A146D2LYLICNLS.html">A146D2LYLICNLS</a><br/><p>It's a well-known fact that most movies these days work by spoon-feeding us the plot, characters and story, not asking us to think about what's going on but rather, simply to entertain us. We enjoy the film and then walk out of the theater going home being thankful that we had the chance to escape reality for a couple of hours. But every once in a while there comes along a movie that asks a little more of us. A movie that asks us to think about what we just saw, what it all meant, and how we can relate to it. "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is the perfect example of such a movie. It's been a long time since a movie as original and thought-provoking like this has come along.<br /><br />The plot is rather simple: Joel (Jim Carrey) finds out that his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has undergone a process that erased their life together from her mind. Both curious as well as desperate to undergo the same process, Joel seeks out the inventor (Tom Wilkinson) of this memory-erasing device and undergoes the same procedure. But as his memories of Clementine begin to dwindle away, Joel realizes the mistake he and Clementine have made, because what they had together was special.<br /><br />Having this plot as its foundation, this movie could have easily been just another run-of-the-mill "romantic comedy" filled with cliched laughs and turn of events. However, it's nothing you would ever expect. There really is no way to describe how "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" plays out. One just has to experience it for themselves. One thing is true though: this is not a movie for those with a low attention span, or those who can't appreciate a film that diverges from the formulatic blueprint. I'll admit that I couldn't make sense of the whole thing upon my first viewing. So for most people, this movie will take multiple viewings to fully grasp. But the payoff is worth it, believe me. It's not about the destination, but the journey getting there.<br /><br />I can't end this review without praising Jim Carrey's performance. This is hands-down his best acting in his career, proving that he's capable of being much more than the rubber-faced, over-the-top screwball character. I hope he makes more movies in the future that allow his true talent to shine. But Jim Carrey isn't the only one who gives a great performance. I was equally impressed with Kate Winslet, who's very charming and likeable as Clementine. She and Carrey have great chemistry together. Who would have thought?<br /><br />I'll end by saying that "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is a movie not to be missed, offering something truly special that most movies out there don't have the courage to do. It's a unique type of love story that's a reminder of what's most important in our lives, and that we shouldn't let a good thing go if we have it, despite its imperfections. I've rarely been as moved, entertained and touched as I was by this movie. A highly recommended addition to anyone's movie collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EBLL2OYEQJN9.html">A2EBLL2OYEQJN9</a><br/><p>This is an examination of a relationship--the highs and the lows, the good memories you'd give anything to keep, the on-going nagging issues, the misunderstandings.  In addition to being a romance, Eternal Sunshine is also a mystery, because Carrey needs to figure out who was behind his girlfriend Clementine's memory erasure, and he needs to figure out how to survive on his own.<br /><br />The movie is a lot easier to follow than the previews let on.  The portrayal of Carrey's inner memory map, and how memories converge into one another, was beautiful.  The filmmakers are to be admired for capturing the concept so well on screen.  Pick this one up if you want a nice break from the usual romantic comedy fare.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>A beautiful, poetic, thought-provoking film. Top-notch cast, strikingly original story, and gorgeous cinematography. Jim Carrey continues to amaze me, and Kate Winslet is superb. Kirsten Dunst needs more films like this and less Spider-man sequels, and Mark Ruffalo is in top form.Tom Wilkinson is a treat as always. A truly wonderful film that is definitely not for all tastes. For one, it will get you thinking and discussing it afterward. Some people just won't get it, others won't want to, but for whoever does, it couldn't get any better. See it! It's near perfect storytelling. A solid A.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>When I first heard of this film it didn't interest me that much but after a number of recommendations I dove into it. Thankfully enough I found "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" an excellent romantic and intriguing comedy-drama about two people who don't truly realize they are in love until one loses the other. Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) is a lonely yet sweet man who is looking for true love and the ideal woman. His search ends when he meets Clementine Krucynksi (Kate Winslet), an energetic and wild young woman. Clementine is everything Joel isn't... at least not the Joel the world sees. The feelings locked up inside of him are released through Clementine. They prove you do not have to make love or kiss all the time to be in love. This couple can play music, in the snow, go shopping, or just lounge around at home and the audience can tell they are in love. But as time goes by, their relationship begins to shatter and really goes to the extreme when Joel discovers Clementine erased him from her mind, thanks to a brilliant doctor's invention. Joel contacts the agency, Lacuna Inc., and its main doctor, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), for Joel to receive the same operation. During the evening Dr. Mierzwiak and his team: another doctor/technician (Mark Ruffalo), a lovestruck receptionist/assistant (Kirsten Dunst), and naive (Elijah Wood) perform the operation, Joel evaluates his relationship with Clementine and realizes he is still in love with her and wishes to keep the memories of her.<br /><br />"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is an incredible film and one of the greatest modern romantic comedies of our time. It is smart, clever, and charming with an exceptional cast and an intelligent crew. This movie received many excellent reviews and anyone that I've known that has seen it agrees. A movie like that is superb.  This movie is unique and makes the audience think and comprehend of what is happening. Carrey delivers a superb performance that made him avoid the "Oscar". His humor mixed with sadness and all the complexity of the character made me understand that he is a great actor (before, Truman Show made the audience give a serious look at this actor) and performer. Kate Winslet, again, delivers a full featured character, a "girl" from town, this "Shakespeare" actress can do it all and likely see the wild and funny side of her, what you would think would be vice versa. The supporting cast consisting of Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, and Tom Wilkinson is does a great job. Charlie Kaufman, as always, writes a phenomenal script with such creativity and intellect. Speaking of intellect, director Michel Gondry uses his own intellect to make this film a spectacle. The shots are captivating and exciting.<br /><br />"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is a romantic motion picture unlike any other. It is definitely not one of those typical romantic comedies when they both love each other without realizing it. This film captures beauty and the true quality of a great film. This film is one of the better films out there and anyone else who has will agree.</p></br><a href="../users/A10E3F50DIUJEE.html">A10E3F50DIUJEE</a><br/><p>I truly enjoyed this movie.  Although I will warn you that if you want traditional romance, comedy, and drama, then this film is not for you.  After all it is made by Focus Features, and was written by Charlie Kauffman.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a quirky comedy/drama.  Jim Carrey is amazing as the understated, and at times, dull Joel.  Kate Winslet is perfection as the outspoken, trying-so-hard-to-impress-you freak girl Clementine.  They meet and have a wonderful relationship, but like so many others, they fall apart.<br /><br />In the quirkiest of turns, Joel finds out Clementine has had him erased from her memory, so Joel decides to do the same.  And this is where the action and emotion begin.  While remembering all the pain and anguish this love affair caused him, he also realizes that those emotions pale in comparison to the love and affection they also shared (but have apparently forgotten about).<br /><br />This movie has a truly stunning ending that makes me cry with happiness.  The story is so brutally honest that anyone who has ever loved and lost should feel some sort of connection to these characters and their plight.<br /><br />I love this movie, and it will continue to be one of my favorites for all time.  Highly recommended!!</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>Jim Carrey does very well in this highly unusual drama. If you are considering purchasing this DVD, go with the 2-disk "Special Edition".<br /><br />MY IMPRESSIONS OF THE FILM:<br /><br />The chronology of this film is unconventionally ordered, but it is not just for the sake of being different. I got this DVD for my 16-year-old daughter to watch as she is a big Jim Carrey fan, but I found the movie to be more compelling for me than I expected. Jim Carrey's role was serious and he was superb. The supporting cast, a rather eclectic ensemble were perfect for the role, especially Kate Winslet as Carrey's very weird significant other [Clementine] and Tom Wilkinson as the mad scientist/doctor who appears as staid and perfectly mainstream as everyone's family doctor or dentist. Wilkinson's mundane delivery of really profound statements is shockingly powerful. One instance has Carrey [Joel Barish] asking Wilkinson [Dr.Mierzwiak] if the procedure could cause brain damage to which the good doctor replied blandly, "Technically speaking, it is brain damage, but nothing you will miss; like a night of heavy drinking." The result of all this is a huge and unexpected emotional connection and investment in the characters based completely on a ridiculous premise.<br /><br />So well done is the character driven theme of this movie that I found myself believing that all this was possible while simultaneously wrenching over the pain Joel and Clementine were going through as a result of this relentlessly-irreversible procedure.<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD:<br /><br />The transfer is great, as expected being a mega-budget new release. As far as the features go, I expected much more due to the really intriguing nature of the film. We'll have to settle for a pretend TV commercial featuring Dr. Mierzwiak and his new memory-erasing procedure, a small featurette, and a few deleted scenes. In the new "2-disk Special Edition" we can see some additional cool features but for those of us who already bought the first widescreen or fullscreen DVD release it is a bummer.<br /><br />If you are considering the purchase of this film, go with the 2-Disk "Special Edition" because you'll get DTS stereo audio as well as the additional special features in the bargain.<br /><br />OVERALL:THIS FILM DESERVES REPEATED VIEWINGS<br /><br />My daughter and I have watched this film at least 10 times and we have yet to tire of it. We both feel it is Carrey at his best in a new and very effective role. It is a film that one understands and enjoys more the second time. See what you think!</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>I'm sure watching this a few times will have the effect of erasing any confusion you might have.  I am sure.  But...well, I can't recall if I ever saw this film.  Yet, yet...  There's Jim Carrey in my mind playing a straight role.  Sorta straight.  Actually Kate Winslet has most of the good comedic lines.  I can't tell whether she was once a girl friend of mine or if I watched her in a movie.  She says she's high maintenance and she has to have a different color for her hair every week.  Yeah, I remember her.  My god she was nice.  Quirky, but nice.<br /><br />And then she erased all memory of me.  I saw her in this book store and she pretended she didn't know me.  Didn't know me!  Wow, after all we had been through.  I mean she's an emotional roller coaster.  And that really dissed me off so I had my memory of her erased.  And then we began to see each other in strange places, on the beach--but that was right.  I met her on the beach.  But then I was a child and she was there under the kitchen table, and my mom washed me in the sink and I felt so secure and Clementine oh my darling you are lost and gone forever, dreadful sorry Clementine was so, so sweet and so so pretty and just a nut case.<br /><br />And then there's Kirsten Dunst, she of the incredibly agreeable figure, dancing over my body as I lay electronically stoned.  Mary, her name is.  She and the doc had this fling.  He would get her to somehow seduce him and then erase the memory and then get her to do it again.  Really bummed his wife out.<br /><br />Oh, but Clem and I are here as on a darkling plain where ignorant armies clash by night and I think something's missing, the ground or the sky or some wall or maybe something is fused together that shouldn't be fused together, like this old house on the beach that Clem broke into, I mean she has balls, and I was just a fraidy cat, and wait, wait, I am gaining control.  She and I together are chasing down the missing parts of our memories erased by the evil Lacuna Inc. people.  All these memory movies going through my head--Memento (2000) especially, by Christopher Nolan.  There's something going on here with these memory movies.  I think Oliver Sacks has something to do with it.  Are we just our memories, and who would we be without our memories?  Would life be worth living?  If we just lived in the here and the now would we be animals?<br /><br />Anyway, this is a love story, the love story of my life.  But is it possible to selectively erase memories?  I mean creating lacunar infarcts on purpose?  Is that legal?  It is safe?  Lacunar infarcts come from strokes that leave little blank spaces in your brain so that you're missing something like the memory of your first kiss or the time you saw Wayne's World..<br /><br />Okay, this is science fiction like Vanilla Sky (2001) with Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz.  The dialogue is really sharp with all sorts of witticism written mostly by screenwriter Charlie Kaufman who also wrote the script for Being John Malkovich (1999).  Need I say more?  I mean clever with a capital K.  By the way, idle thought: Clementine's last name is Kruczynski.  Isn't that the Unibomber's last name, good old Ted?  No, that was Kaczynski.  Okay, never mind.  Anyway, here's a clever line: "Are we like couples you see in restaurants?  Are we the dining dead?"  I think I said that, or wish I had.  Or, "Drink up young man.  It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant."  She said that, and I guess she oughta know, heaven help us, from first hand experience.<br /><br />Look, if I ever, but ever, get a chance to fall in love with Kate Winslet, please, please, do NOT erase the memory.  Thank you.<br /><br />Bottom line: bizarro and entertaining, witty and cute, with a nice cast.  And Jim Carrey as a straight up kinda guy is a terrific actor, and Kate, well I'll tell you a secret, gentlemen.  You can see a full frontal sans clothes shot of her in the movie Jude (1996).  Yes.  Also worth watching is her debut film Heavenly Creatures (1994) shot when she was 18.<br /><br />One last line, as Joel says, "Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating."</p></br><a href="../users/A1655SGPPUUCRP.html">A1655SGPPUUCRP</a><br/><p>"How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot!<br /><br />The world forgetting, by the world forgot<br /><br />Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!<br /><br />Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd."<br /><br />--"Eloisa to Abelard" by Alexander Pope, a quotation read by Mary to Dr. Mierzwiak during the film<br /><br />"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is one of the most intensely beautiful and heartbreakingly honest films that I have ever seen.  I am truly at a lost for words; I am awed by the utter brilliance of screenwriter Charlie Kauffman.  This man is a genius.  He understands love and expresses it in such a stunning and truthful way that I never thought possible onscreen.  Never before have I seen such an innovative, quirky, and truly touching film.  Not the kind of touching that leaves you bawling for hours afterwards in the "Titanic" tradition, but the kind that really sticks with you; the kind that hits a nerve and will have you thinking about it for months afterwards.<br /><br />With "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", both Jim Carrey and Charlie Kauffman prove something to us.  Carrey establishes himself without a doubt as a talented, versatile actor.  For awhile, I never though he'd move beyond slapstick comedies (think "Ace Ventura), which he's good at, don't get me wrong, but this man has such an interesting soul and such profound emotional depth that never really had a chance to shine through until now (we caught a glimpse of it in the enjoyable "The Majestic").  I hope that now that Carrey has proved himself more dramatic roles will be offered to him.  He is capable of much more than we originally believed!<br /><br />Two of my favorite quotations (my favorite is above).  Simple and beautiful, especially if you've seen the film and can put them in context.<br /><br />Clementine: This is it, Joel. It's going to be gone soon.<br /><br />Joel: I know.<br /><br />Clementine: What do we do?<br /><br />Joel: Enjoy it.<br /><br />Joel: I don't see anything I don't like about you.<br /><br />Clementine: But you will! But you will, and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped, because that's what happens with me.<br /><br />Joel: Okay.<br /><br />[last lines]<br /><br />Clementine: Okay.<br /><br />Joel: Okay.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>As you may already know, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is about two lovers who love each other despite the fact that they are rather mismatched. Clementine (played by Kate Winslet) decides she's unhappy in the relationship after yet another fight and goes to a company named Lacuna that specializes in erasing unwanted or unhappy memories from a person's mind. She wants to rid her memory of Joel. Joel (played by Jim Carrey) decides to do the same after he accidentally finds out his former girlfriend has had "the procedure." Unfortunately Joel decides too late--during the procedure--that he doesn't want to forget Clementine. He tries to retain some of his memories of her. Joel dreams of running away with Clementine from the memory erasing process during his sleep. The ending of the film has an unexpected happy twist: The office assistant sends all the patients' files back to them from Lacuna with the possibility that patients can then choose to regain at least some of their memories. Joel and Clementine meet in Joel's apartment and there seems to be hope that they will learn from their mistakes and try their luck at love again.<br /><br />At first the plot can be a bit confusing since the film alternates between flashbacks and the present. Nevertheless, the scenes are actually very carefully thought out and planned--even if you know the plot beforehand you can truly appreciate the movie anyway. The acting is very convincing. Many people have commented that both Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey get to expand themselves in this film: Carrey plays a very shy guy who speaks little, while Winslet plays a loud mouthed free spirit. The cinematography is excellent and many of the character's emotions are so universal we can all relate to them: There is the longing to feel wanted by Joel throughout his life; and the freedom of acting on impulses in Clementine. Great performances are also turned in by Elijah Wood and Mark Ruffalo as two inept Lacuna employees who don't do a very good job of monitoring Joel during the procedure to erase Clementine from Joel's mind. Although there are some mildly funny moments I would call this film a drama more than a comedy.<br /><br />The DVD comes with great extras including deleted scenes, a conversation between Jim Carrey and the director Michel Gondry, a brief TV commercial for Lacuna as well as a music video.<br /><br />This is a great film for adults; it's not a family film since it does have sex and drug scenes as well as language content. I believe this film is going to be one of the better films of this year and I highly recommend the DVD. BUY IT!</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>Movies are not always so easy to review because all movies are not created equally. Some are big budget ventures whose sole purpose is to entertain. These are relatively easy. Despite a critic's personal feelings, it fairly easy to see that, for example, "Spiderman 2" is a lot more bang for the buck than "Lara Croft 2".<br /><br />Movies like "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" are harder to write about because they aspire to be art. Whether or not they entertain in the conventional sense is of secondary importance. `Art' is such a subjective thing. When a reviewer uses words like `masterpiece', `genius' or `brilliant', a red flag is raised. The opinion becomes very subjective. To me, "Eternal Sunshine" is the most interesting American movie I have seen so far in 2004. It is also the best love story / romantic comedy I have watched in awhile. To you, the opposite may be true.<br /><br />The premise itself is simple. Joel [Jim Carrey] and Clementine [Kate Winslett], two eccentric people, meet and fall in love. They have a falling out, and Clementine resorts to a doctor [Tom Wilkinson] who knows how to erase all memory of Joel from her mind. Naturally, this leaves Joel dazed and confused. When he finds out the truth, the angry young man confronts the doctor and his staff. Forlorn and desperate, he takes the only logical course and has the doctor erase HIS memories of Clementine. The question then becomes whether or not true love can ever really be forgotten.<br /><br />The movie bounces wildly between past and present, between real memories and false ones. This is the way it loses some viewers because the plot is anything but linear.<br /><br />Since "The Truman Show", I've thought that Carrey is a remarkable actor who has been trapped by his "I'm so funny" reputation. He really should get a Best Actor Oscar nod for his work here. Kate Winslett is superb as Clementine. In supporting roles, Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Woods and Mark Ruffalo are outstanding.<br /><br />I think in years to come "Eternal Sunshine" will be rememberd as both a mesmerizing love story and as a sharp commentary on relationships is the early 21st Century.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is Charlie Kaufman's best screenplay to date. His typical self-indulgence is tamed by a tight, disciplined story. The offbeat and unconventional script comments on the value of relationships and painful memories without being weird for its own sake. Michel Gondry's relatively low budget direction is creative, stylized, but not heavy-handed. I think this is Jim Carrey's best dramatic role, as well. Joel (Jim Carrey) has split with Clementine (Kate Winslet), his free-spirited girlfriend of two years. As Valentine's Day approaches, he decides to try to reconcile, but finds to his bewilderment that Clementine doesn't seem to recognize him. She has impulsively had their tempestuous relationship erased from her memory in an effort to put it behind her. Joel tracks down Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkerson), who performed the procedure, and decides in a huff to do the same. But midway through the erasure, Joel changes his mind. He tries desperately to preserve memories of Clementine by hiding her in parts of his brain the procedure may not reach.<br /><br />Considering that the past, present, fantasy, and reality all run together in "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless  Mind", it's amazing how coherent this film is. We go backward and forward, in and out of memories, switch between characters and subplots, and I never lost track of what was going on. Nor does the film ever lose its emotional focus. Michel Gondry and the film's editor, Vald&iacute;s &Oacute;skarsd&oacute;ttir, have done some amazing work. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are perfectly suited to their roles. Carrey is low-key, and Winslet takes on the hyperactive, outgoing role that is usually his. Kirsten Dunst does a nice job in a supporting role as Dr. Mierzwiak's enamored secretary. Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood are appropriately flakey as his technicians.  "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is one of the best films of 2004, and it deserved better than a tepid reception at the box office. Its brilliant direction, two big stars, and off-the-wall, but ultimately upbeat, script never fail to entertain.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include 2 featurettes, an audio commentary by director Michel Gondry and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, 4 deleted scenes, a music video, and a commercial for Lacuna, Inc., the memory erasure folks. "A Look Inside Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" (10 minutes) features interviews with the cast and principle crew in which they talk about their roles in the film. It's not insightful. "A Conversation with Jim Carrey and Director Michel Gondry" (15 minutes) contains more information about making the film and has some funny moments. The audio commentary isn't bad, but it does have a rambling quality and a lot of lulls. I would have liked more technical information, because the film is so innovative, but there is some discussion of how the film's very long shots were made. The music video is for the song "Light & Day" by Polyphonic Spree. Not a good video. It's too bad that the DVD does not include the theatrical trailer for the film, as it was one of the most creative and effective trailers in my memory. Subtitles are available in French and Spanish, captioning in English. And dubbing is available in French.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>I am so happy I have this movie.

A smart, out-of-the box and funny script by Charlie Kaufman, a good director and dynamite performances make this both thought-provoking and greatly entertaining.<br /><br />Jim Carrey, whose manic/zany performances turn me off, is brilliant here (as he was in The Truman Show).  He plays vulnerable so well, I'd like to see him do more of that.  The early scenes with him on the bus, wanting to talk to the girl, but terrified of actually doing it, are perfect.<br /><br />Kate Winslett is always good.  Here her youthful joie de vivre makes an indelible impression on Joel, the Carrey character, and on the audience.  As Clementine, aka Tangerine, with her multicolored hair and quixotic personality she makes a perfect match to the shy introvert Joel.<br /><br />A subplot, involving the employees of a company that erases troublesome memories works in its own bizarre way.  Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood are all very good in their roles.<br /><br />I got a little bored with the flashbacks to Joel's childhood, wanting Mommy to hold him, etc.  They were a little too literal for my taste.  But there was so much that was wonderful that I won't subtract a star from the rating.<br /><br />Some of my favorite scenes:<br /><br />-Carrey and Winslett playing in the snow at the beach.  Wow---how much fun was that?!<br /><br />-The sheer zaniness of Dunst and Ruffalo dancing in their underwear over the sleeping body of Carrey as he's getting "the treatment."<br /><br />-The scene of Jim and Kate in the hall, near the end, when she confesses that she'll probably get bored with him and he says "OK" and she bursts into tears.  Whoa!  Cinema doesn't get much better than this---it reminds me of the emotional honesty of John Cassvetes' films.<br /><br />I didn't care all that much for Kaufman's films, "Malkovich" and "Adaptation."  I admired their cleverness but didn't really like them.  This has the same smartness but with a lot of heart and that's what makes the difference.  That's what makes this a film worth seeing, which I think will last for a long time.</p></br><a href="../users/A16GAIJJE39T1S.html">A16GAIJJE39T1S</a><br/><p>I was moved to write this review after perusing an online list of romantic movies (due to the approach of Valentine's Day) which included this film.  This movie was given the tag line: "Ever wish you could erase the memory of a failed romance?"  Unfortunately, the characters in this film surcome to such a temptation--with troubling results.  Jim Carry once again shows himself to be an excellent dramatic actor as he relives his volatile romance with his onetime kooky girlfriend played by Kat Winslet.  This movie also features winning performances by Kirsten Dunst as an unwittingly compromised employee of the memory erasing company, and Elijah Woods playing against type as a creepy opportunist.<br /><br />As a counterpoint to this movie, and its proof by contradiction regarding the importance of disfunctional relationships (and their recollection), the admirers of this film should read the poem by Guillaume Apollinaire "Le Pont Mirabeau" (The Mirabeau Bridge) and contemplate the fleeting nature of such an ephemeral romance.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind takes a leap of faith that medical science can now erase specific sad or hurtful memories.  The main characters in this movie are a quirky couple, Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet).  They have a wonderful relationship, yet time and familiarity slowly tears them apart through hurt and anger. A painful fight and cutting words cause Clementine to have a medical procedure so she can erase Joel from her mind.  Joel is hurt too.  The scenes flip from time to time and at one point we see Joel approaching Clementine in a book store where she works, and realizes she does not recognize him.  He  breaks doen in front of his friends.  As he becomes desperate with heartache and pain his friend sympathizes, and gives Joel a confidential card with the doctor's name that erased Clementine's memory of him.<br /><br />Joel then goes to Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) to get the same treatment as Clementine.  As his memories begin to fade, he realizes how much he still loves her.  He fights back in his mind as the medical technicians (Kirsten Dunst and<br /><br />Most of the movie is going inside Joel's mind during the medical procedure as memories of Clementine are erased.  The fantastic camera work showing memories coming and going, disjointed flashbacks and  eerie comedic tone is stunning to watch.  The cinematography and special effects throughout are utterly amazing, entertaining and truly communicate the happiness, hurt and strange unbreakable connections of true love.<br /><br />Carrey plays his part well, not his usual over-the-top characterizations, Winslet is wonderful as the free-spirited sprite and love interest.  There are excellent performances by Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo.  The actors give a topnotch performance, full of hip catchy youthful dialogue.<br /><br />This movie is fun and different.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a brilliant, thoughtful look at true love.  The acceptance of each others shortcomings, and forgetting and forgiving.</p></br><a href="../users/A38921VU3NJDFK.html">A38921VU3NJDFK</a><br/><p>This abstract romantic-comedy by writer/director Michel Gondry is given the boundary-less treatment one would expect from a loopy sci-fi pic. Teaming with famed playwright Charlie Kaufman, Gondry delivers a genuine love story that links the emotionally distant Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey) with the effervescent, free-spirited Clementine (Kate Winslet). Unbeknownst to them, they just ended a relationship with each other. But in their yearning to move on, they had their memories erased by a medical firm based in New York--well, Joel almost did...until he woke up during the procedure, turning his world into one of mental confusion and illogicality.<br /><br />Gondry is a visionary, and Eternal Sunshine is both his crowning work as an artist and one of the most innovative, audacious comedies of the last decade.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>Although deliberately disorienting, this psychological drama with some science fiction elements seems to wrap up rather well, but it's an emotional rollercoaster ride for the viewer!<br /><br />But to connect the dots of this love story takes a lot of work for the audience/viewer to sort out.  Reminds me strongly of elements from Chris Nolan's Memento in form and substance to a large degree.  Joel Barrish is played by Jim Carrey in a dramatic, intensely emotional role and Kate Winslett plays Clementine, a wilful, brutally honest woman with an impulsive mind of her own.<br /><br />The story actually has a backdrop regarding a company called Lacuna, which specializes in wiping memories of those we've missed and rather than deal with the pain, we would rather forget about it.  Unfortunately trying to forget instead of deal with it is not so easy.<br /><br />Thus the good doctor that runs Lacuna runs a very brisk business.  People want to forget Fido or forget their dead husbands and wives, their broken hearts.  The doc and his employees are a pretty irresponsible, unethical bunch.<br /><br />The doctor himself uses the memory erasing techniques to wipe out his receptionist's affair with him.  Damn!  And Patrick, another assistant, uses Joel's memories to pick up on the girl Joel is erasing.  Stealing the files, Patrick's plan seems to work out OK for some time.  This part of the story was never resolved for me, since Patrick never was caught or punished for this clear doctor patient violation.<br /><br />Trying not to get too "into" the subplots, Joel overall seemed a good guy in this film but a bit addled and frightened by the memory erasure procedure, especially after he found out that his girl did the same thing.<br /><br />The special effects were well done and subdued -- memories erase, and Clementine and Joel hide in memories to prevent the erasing.<br /><br />The overall film, though very original and at times endearing and charming, did not hold my interest to a great degree.  Even so, Kate Winslett got an Academy Award nomination for best actress in 2004 for this film.<br /><br />Jim Carrey in a dramatic role never appealed to me, so I must protest the casting.<br /><br />What if you could erase memories of those you've loved and lost?  And could you trust a company that would do that for you not to go all unethical and irresponsible on you, and take advantage of your trust?<br /><br />Frightening concept.<br /><br />It is available as a one-disc Widescreen Collector's Edition worldwide.

If cloning is ever allowed in the United States we need to clone Mr. Kaufman. (If there is any community that will embrace cloning it will be Hollywood. Name any other place in America where nepotism is a religion. Hiring your own clone is the ultimate in nepotism.)<br /><br />Charlie Kaufman has found that fine line between realistic dialog and interesting dialog. Characters talk, fight and fall in love just like they do in real life. But unlike most movies that try to mirror real life speech Kaufman makes it interesting. (Of course it helps that Kaufman is always throwing in the bizarre; such as adulterous homicidal book authors addicted to sniffing Angel Trumpet or people entering John Malkovich's head.)<br /><br />Now just imagine if a Kaufman clone could, oh I don't know, help George Lucas write romantic dialog. (If there is anyone who occupies the opposite side of the good dialog screen writing scales its Lucas. His dialog is so wooden it would embarrass a marionette. Plus think of the Variety headline "Kaufman Clone helps pen Clones")<br /><br />Oh the movie. Eternal Sunshine has some great performances especially by a subdued Jim Carrey. (This should surprise but after his brilliant turn in Man on the Moon, the only real surprise is how with his quiet desperate performance you forget its Carrey.) There is a really good subplot about the goings on at a mind erasure clinic. (The movie sensibly sets it up as a no big deal four-man operation like one of those laser eye surgery places in a strip mall.)<br /><br />And there is a really realistic romance between Carrey and Kate Winslet that blows most movies away. Currently ranked Fifty-Seventh greatest movie of all time by the IMDb. Eternal Sunshine is one movie you won't be able to get out of your head.</p></br><a href="../users/A10DB0H2NZF11E.html">A10DB0H2NZF11E</a><br/><p>I just rented this.<br />Simply put, this is a great movie.<br />It is very strange but you will love it.<br />I would categorize it as a Surrealistic Romantic Comedy.<br />When it was over we wanted to watch it again but we had no time.<br />Great Movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A1K3NQAO49LXL2.html">A1K3NQAO49LXL2</a><br/><p>A strange movie about memory. Jim Carry is an unlovable schmuck, but for some reason he meets this wacky, gorgeous girl who's also quite horny. Slowly we get to see him interact with this girl, slowly we realize that there's much more behind their relationship. Why? Because it's a film from a Charlie Kaufmann script, where anything can happen. The couple has tender, happy moments that are very memorable (or memory-like) in an iconic kind of way. These are devices we refer back to, they make the movie feel like it is warm, comfortable, and we root for the heroes who struggle against what they are doing to themselves. Do they know that they were destined to be together? Things get weird - once we figure out what is going on, we get some back story. And then that back story gets back story. And then that back story also gets back story. And then the back story becomes the only story that there ever was. Because it's destiny. Complaints? None, really, although Kirstin Dunst acting horny is a bit awkward - she doesn't do horny well. Elijah Wood is good and creepy. And Jim Carrey - well, he can act... like a dork. I sometimes wonder how many people out there have so much time for resolving their inner demons that they don't really need to do regular things like work, cook, watch TV...</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />With perfect performances by a vivacious Winslet and a restrained Carrey, ingenious writing/directing by Kaufmann and Gondry, respectively, clever plotting and a touching finale, Eternal Sunshine may have a clunky title, but it's one of the more original and interesting romances to come out in years.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z44AN3F2IN61.html">A2Z44AN3F2IN61</a><br/><p>This DVD was a gift to my daughter, and we watched it with her. She says it's the best movie she's ever seen. I wasn't quite as enthralled as she was, but I enjoyed it very much anyway.<br /><br />When the movie opens, Joel (Jim Carrey) impulsively skips work and goes to the shore, where he meets a blue-haired woman, Clementine (Kate Winslet) and they hit it off. But then strange things start happening.<br /><br />Turns out, Clementine has had boyfriend Joel erased from her mind. When he gets the letter from the memory-erasing clinic informing him of this, he decides to have her erased from his mind as well.<br /><br />The movie jumps back and forward in time, which can be a little disorienting, though I think that was the point. Oddly enough, the story flows well that way, as things learned in one scene impact the meaning of the next regardless of where they fit in the chronology, and the story is much more effective than if it had been told in strict chronological order.<br /><br />I suspect part of the difference between my daughter's "best movie ever" and my 4.5 stars is that I've read and watched a lot more science fiction than she has, and the concept of erasing memories isn't a new one for me. I did enjoy the details of the technique in this one, though I'd have liked to see it explored a little more thoroughly. For example, much was made of needing to find every single object connected with the person to be erased, but we never saw the consequences of missing something.<br /><br />I was surprised, though, that she liked the romance of the movie--she's usually pretty cynical about such things. I, of course, loved the "true love conquers all" as well as the twists when things started going wrong.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L.html">A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L</a><br/><p>What if you could forget a person so completely that you would never know that you had met them, spent time with them, even loved them?<br /><br />The ability to do exactly that is what lies at the heart of this drama, which takes us on a journey through Joel's (Carrey) mind as his memories are selectively erased. Kaufman's great visuals give physical form to Joel's memories and their systematic destruction: Houses disintegrate, faces become blurred and entire streets crumble as, neuron by neuron, the procedure progresses.<br /><br />We learn that the impetus for this voluntary brain damage is Joel's roller-coaster romance, and bitter breakup, with the impulsive Clementine (Winslet). As in 'Adaptation' Kaufman approaches love with a realism that is often deeply cynical but ultimately betrays a loner's desire to be loved. Everyman Joel and the untameable Clementine make a good pair, and most of us will be able to identify with their tumultuous relationship.<br /><br />An excellent, highly imaginative exploration of how the little things in life, good or bad, make us who we are. DVD includes commentary, interviews with Kaufman and Carrey as well as some other extras. Highly recommended DVD!</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>The one thing you must remember when viewing this film is to WATCH IT BEYOND THE FIRST 20 MINUTES! That first bit of the film might make you think you are watching another insufferable Jim Carey movie about a couple of simpleminded (brain damaged? mentally ill? Borderline retarded?) people who fall in love. What becomes clear after the 20-minute point, however, is that "Eternal Sunshine" is a much richer and more interesting film.<br /><br />The main plot device is a company called Lacuna, Inc whose job is to erase bad memories. The rest of the film involved a love story, but also explored the complicated realities and ethics involved when you lose your bad memories but others don't. There are some scary moments in the film, mostly revolving around a character who changes his mind about the procedure. There are intense chase sequences that take place inside a person's memories that are at least as frightening as any chase involving cars or bad guys.<br /><br />Carey and Kate Winslet are perfect as the crazy-in-love couple. Elijah<br /> Wood is perfect as the geeky tech who wants to date Kate. Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst are fantastic as the workaday team busy changing brains while eating pizza and flirting.<br /><br />The real star of the show, though, is artistic. The writing, editing<br /> and lighting had to be perfect to represent the dreamlike mindscapes in which the characters maneuver for much of the film. Sections of the film take on a surreal quality with quick cuts, pinprick lighting, bizarre (but comprehensible) scene changes and repetitions.<br />The effects used to represent the disappearance of cherished memories were varied and quote convincing.<br /><br />A phenomenal achievement on every level.<br /><br />HINT: do not ruin the film by watching Jim Carey mug through the DVD extras. But do watch the infomercial for Lacuna, Inc.</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is another fabulous movie from writer Charlie Kaufman (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007AJF8">Being John Malkovich</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLRE">Adaptation (Superbit Collection)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000714E6">Human Nature</a>).  Joel Barish wants to forget his former girlfriend so he goes to a company and gets his memory erased.<br /><br />This movie is wonderful and really makes you think.  I recommend that everybody should see this movie.<br /><br />The DVD, which is an upgrade from the single disc features a few more things.  Not only do you get the same features from the first disc (which very well may be that first disc) you get a second disc full of other features.<br /><br />There's a second interview with Kate Winslet and Michel Gondry (the first contained Jim Carrey and the director).  A feature for Michel Gondry himself and more deleted scenes from the movie.  There's even a commemorative photo book.<br /><br />This DVD is highly recommended.  The movie's one of the best of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A38YUU4J5Q4EJO.html">A38YUU4J5Q4EJO</a><br/><p>It's true! The more times I watch this movie, the more I discover! It's like peeling an onion- as each layer of skin comes off, it reveals yet another layer...and so forth.There is so much more than meets the eye each time around.<br /><br />The story is centered on a couple ( Jim Carey and Kate Winslet)<br />who after 2 years together,have a nasty arguement, and Winslet goes to a company that specializes in erasing unpleasant memories, and has Carey erased totally from her memory.<br />After He realizes what she has done, he is too hurt to go on without her, and he in turn has her erased.<br /><br />During HIS procedure is where most of the movie takes place-In Carey's unconcious mind. The deeper they probe into his memories to erase her, the more he realizes he really loves her and don't want her erased.<br /><br /> Unconscious though, he is unable to stop them, so begins a dillema in his mind to HIDE her in other PARTS of his memory, And THAT is where the story gets SO original !!! As we see them mapping his brain on a scanner, we see the couple running crazily from them through his memories- LITERALLY!<br /><br />We are also treated to other characters stories : Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood (The staff at the Company that does the erasing)and thier characters add a lot of flavour to the movie, too.<br /><br />I seen another reviewer say that they kept track of time by her hair color (which changes from one bizarre color to the next)and that is also how I kept track.Because it skips in time- a LOT, but in a good way.<br /><br />I just absolutely LOVE this movie, and LOVED seeing Jim Carey in such a serious role  He is so awesome in this!<br />The only reason I only gave it 4 stars, Is that,though<br />it was directed good, I think the directing could have been better.<br /><br /> I think we should have got to know them as a COUPLE a little better BEFORE the break up, Not DURING the erasing procedure. The first time I seen it, I didn't really sympathize with Carey while he was Grieving toward the beginning of the movie- I think SOME of thier closeness should have been revealed earlier on.<br /><br />Over all though, This film is PURE entertainment! - GENIOUS !!<br />I will watch this movie over and over for years to come , and always reccomend it to others.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LNWA25IM2DX.html">A9LNWA25IM2DX</a><br/><p>I watched this movie recently per a friend's recommendation, when it actually came out I did not have any interest as I am not a big Jim Carrey fan. When I was told Carrey's performance was as good as in `Truman Show' I decided to watch it.<br /><br />The movie basically tells the story of  Joel and Clementine, they had a relationship that did not end well, luckily for both, there is a doctor (Tom Wilkinson) who offers an alternative to suffering from heart breaking: erase all the memories related to a person. While the premise sounds a little too weird (written by Charlie Kauffman who previously gave us `Being John Malkovich'), it establishes a very interesting possibility, what if you could do this? (There is a funny moment in which we get to see an old lady waiting for the memories of her dead puppy to be erased.. if you have suffered the loss of a dog you'll understand). The director makes you think about it for a while; yes, we do all have memories we would wish to go away, but would we do it? Is it better to forget than to face and learn from the experience? The `memory deleting' situation is definitely one of the best moments of the film.<br /><br />And it is because in Joel's `memory deleting' process (which takes the most part of the film), we get to see all their memories together... tender moments that make you realize what a wonderful relationship they had. It is in this moment in which Joel faces the fact that he may not want to delete Clementine from his head. There are other subplots related to the characters who perform the `memory deleting' which are ok but do not add anything of value to the central story of Joel and Clementine.<br /><br />While it has some funny moments the movie is not a comedy, actually Carrey's acting is superb in his character of quiet and indecisive Joel, Kate Winslet performs great as supporting Clementine in Joel's brain while his memories are being deleted.<br /><br />Do not be fooled by the premise of the film, it is a very serious movie about relationships and what we learn from them. Directed by Michel Gondry (who has in his resume some of Bjork's best music videos) you can expect not only a good film but also a very interesting visual experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Filmmaker Michel Gondry must be a firm believer in the old saying, "if at first you don't succeed, try, try again." His feature film debut was the Charlie Kaufman-penned Human Nature that, by most accounts, was simply awful. Maybe Gondry just didn't connect with the material or figure out a way to bring it successfully to life. His second feature and second crack at a Kaufman screenplay, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, was met, initially, with trepidation. By most accounts, he's directed one of the most original films in years.<br /><br />The Collector's Edition comes with an attractive booklet filled with glossy photos and excerpts from enthusiastic reviews praising the movie.<br /><br />The first disc starts with "A Look Inside Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," a promo with soundbite interviews and clips from the movie. The cast and crew talk about the characters and the unique nature of the script.<br /><br />"A Conversation with Jim Carrey and Director Michel Gondry" is an entertaining dialogue between the two men mixed with rehearsal footage. They talk about the hardest day of the shoot when they got into a heated argument that they can laugh about now.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by Gondry and Kaufman. They had pitched the idea for the movie as early as 1998 and not surprisingly had a tough time finding a studio willing to take a chance.<br /><br />There are seven minutes of deleted scenes. Unfortunately, there is no context for the footage of a commentary track to explain why they were cut out. It almost simulates the mind erosion that Joel experiences in the movie. What do these scenes mean?<br /><br />There is a music video for "Light and Day" by Polyphonic Spree that tweaks footage from the movie in an unsettling way.<br /><br />There is also a funny commercial for Lacuna, Inc., the fictitious company that erases people's memories.<br /><br />The second disc begins with "Inside the Mind of Michel Gondry", a 20-minute look at the director's creative process. It is amazing how much of the film's more fantastical images were done without CGI, just good ol' fashioned editing, lighting or forced perspective shots.<br /><br />"Anatomy of a Scene: Saratoga Avenue" examines how a specific scene was put together, mostly through CGI with the sound effects and score explored in detail.<br /><br />"A Conversation with Kate Winslet and Director Michel Gondry" is a dialogue between the actress and the filmmaker. She was surprised that Gondry cast her as she was known mostly for reserved period dramas.<br /><br />Finally, there are almost 19-minutes of additional deleted or extended footage. Mostly, it is bits and pieces that were trimmed from existing scenes. We even see Joel's previous girlfriend, Naomi, who is only mentioned in the final cut.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a film about how precious our memories are and how we should savour them while we can because our minds erase them gradually over time on their own anyway. Kaufman has established an ingenious premise: the notion of selectively erasing your memories and reliving a relationship again and again. The story actually starts at the end and works its way back-think of a romantic comedy version of Memento.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WZ1B92F81LJJ.html">A2WZ1B92F81LJJ</a><br/><p>It is, despite the Truman Show, still a bold move to cast Jim Carrey in any movie that doesn't require outrageous slapstick. Here, Carrey is not just required not to gurn, but to play the most anally retentive character in the film. As a concept, you would think, that would be madness. But, and with a surprising amount of ease, it works. Carrey is credible and likeable as the everyman Joel Barish. Just as Joel is believably uptight (bearish, even?), Kate Winslet's Clementine is believably flaky, and their relationship (besotted at first, but ultimately at wits' end with each other) rings very true.<br /><br />This film is not principally concerned with the memory eraser process. That is simply a device which allows the film maker to explore what would happen if two people who have grown apart really did make the proverbial fresh start without the complications of their existing history interfering. The conceptual holes that misunderstanding pedants might seek to pick are intended rather to underscore the point that this really isn't possible. The screenplay also explores the converse situation: what might happen if two people who, having just met and still in the throes of infatuation, are confronted with the reality of what life will be like down the track when, as the late Ian Curtis put it, "routine bites hard, and resentment rides high". Armed with that knowledge, would they still really give it a shot? It's a good question, and one which in real life never gets properly asked.<br /><br />Given the preponderance of "twist" movies in the last five years, I was interested to see that Kaufman deliberately defused a plot twist before it went off by presenting Joel's reconciliation with Clementine before showing their original separation. I wondered, for a while, why he did that, but I think there are two reasons. Firstly, to have the characters fall out of love, erase their memories and then miraculously meet up again as a denouement would be too cheap and manipulative - an audience of the sort Kaufman aspires to attract would see right through that and mark the film down heavily as a result. Secondly, the *fact* of their meeting up again, of itself, isn't what Kaufman is interested in: rather it is the presentation of their forgotten history once the meet-up has taken place. By giving up that fact before the commencement of play, Kaufman can disarm accusations of cheesy sentimentality.<br /><br />A large portion of the film takes place while Joel's memory is in the process of being erased. This allows Kaufman to place a (post-modern) tragic love story in the middle of a film about a couple who have already fallen out of love: Joel knows that, by his own intemperance (in commencing the erasure process in the first place), everything of his relationship (good as well as bad) will be lost as surely as if Clementine has died. As the process wears on, the more her sins pale into significance and they resemble star cross'd lovers, dashing from room to room avoiding the inevitable onset of sleep.<br /><br />There were two minor things I didn't understand. Firstly, while most of the medical characters were plot-functional, I couldn't fathom the Patrick character. I couldn't see what his point was, other than to assist Elijah Wood to de-typecast from a furry little hobbit. Query, though, whether "oily little creep" is the sort of type he really wants to be moving into. Secondly, unless I misheard, at one point Joel Barish was referred to as "still Mrs. Carrey's little boy". Was this a continuity error, or simply a playful bit of screenwriting from Mr Kaufman?<br /><br />I suspect we will never know.<br /><br />Beautifully shot and imaginatively staged, this one is definitely a keeper.<br /><br />Olly Buxton</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>I guess the moral of the story is that good memories really do outweigh the bad. The merging of two stories in one is brilliant. On one story, you have a man (Jim) who had a bad relationship and wants his memory of her erased, but during the proceedure he discovers that he loves her and doesn't want the memories gone. Then the other story envolves those who are erasing Joel's memory and the conflicts they exchange while doing their job.<br /><br />I really do enjoy this film and think it's one of Jim Carrey's best. I think this surpases my other favorite JC drama "The Majestic". Jim Carrey just proves once again that even though he is known for his comedy roles, he can also be fantastic actor in other genres as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AP6H48QHX8BR.html">A3AP6H48QHX8BR</a><br/><p>This is one of the movies we luck out when it is made. Yes, while most romantic comedies are un-orignal and un-thought provoking every now and then a decent movie comes along by chance, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is nothing short of genius and made me believe in love.<br /><br />I love this movie!<br /><br />Jim Carrey gives his best performance as Joel who is determined to have his ex-girlfriend Clemintine- Kate Winslet erased from his mind. But, as the erasing process begins he remembers his horrible arugements and incidents that brought about their break-up. But, remembers the things and moments that made him love Winslet. As his memories of her begin to fade Joel realizes all he is losing and goes in a desperate race against time to remember Clemintine. It's a movie that brings a whole new meaning to you don't know what you have until it's gone. By of this movie I was close to crying.<br /><br />Kaufman has written a eleborate, touching, and funny script to the screen and deserved an Academy Award for his work. Jim Carrey has a future in romantic comedies after the first fifteen minutes I found myself swooning after him. Kate Winslet does an excellent portryal as Celmintine whose hair changes with her mood and deserved an Oscar. All in all this movie is spotless.<br />Rent or buy this one and share it with the person you love!</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>This was a little weird, but good. You might have to force yourself to get through the first 15 or 20 minutes, but then things pick up and fall into place. It is a little like "Memento" and others of that genre. Not too predictable. Carrey is at one of his finest points, which surprised me. Questionable for dates, but good movie for (stable) couples.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>What procedure is this?  By now you know, I'm sure.  Jim Carrey plays Joel, a quiet, reserved man who is most unsure of himself.  He is at a small lab called Lacuna, a company which specializes in removing the memories of someone you love so they don't hurt you anymore.  Joel's ex girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet) has already had the procedure performed and so Joel is there partly for spite and partly to let go of the pain.<br /><br />The movie, around 100 minutes in length, spends the majority of this time on Joel's procedure.  The lab is staffed by a main doctor (Tom Wilkenson), an assistant who does the all night erasing work (Mark Ruffalo), a pretty receptionist (Kirsten Dunst) and a kid who assists Ruffalo in the erasure (Elijah Wood).  About halfway through the erasure of Clementine from his memory, Joel decides there are some memories too good to let go of, and decides that the pain of loving and losing her is better than thinking he never knew her and he tries to abort the procedure.  This leads us into a strange journey into Joel's subconscious, where he tries to outwit the doctors he has hired to cleanse his brain of his ex girlfriend.<br /><br />The film is a brilliant idea and is very well executed.  Visually it is stunning, as Joel's memories are erased, we see his surroundings changing around him.  Charlie Kaufman, the writer, has already shown us his ability to think outside the box with his movies, with films like "Being John Malkovich" and "Adaptation".  Here, he once again takes a simple concept like love lost and takes a totally different angle on it--What if you could go back to before you ever met this person and start from scratch?<br /><br />The film actually answers this question--or it tries to.  The one weakness of the movie is that there are a couple of side plots which tie the whole story together, but are not really necessary and we don't care about them.  This is a movie about Joel and Clementine, not anyone else.  I found these other storylines, which come toward the end of the film, tiresome and distracting.<br /><br />The DVD itself is okay, but nothing superb.  There is a conversation between the French director, Michel Gondry and star Jim Carrey which is interesting, a commentary with screenwriter Kaufman and Gondry, and a brief "look" at the film with snipit interviews with the whole cast.  It's basically a long trailer of the movie.  There are 4 deleted scenes which add nothing to the story and were wisely left out, and finally a short commercial to the fictional company "Lacuna" which is funny.  The film's transfer is very good, and the sound (DTS) is great.  Overall this is a DVD you will enjoy.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EGDRTJYF3AZK.html">A1EGDRTJYF3AZK</a><br/><p>This is one of those movies that raises the question, what if? What if this kind of technology was real, would I have somebody or something erased, and if I did who or what would it be?<br /><br /> Upon first viewing of this movie I thought it was a little drawn out and not as entertaining as I thought it would be, but as the days pass I find myself thinking about it and thinking about who or what I would erase and I find that I can't get this movie out of my head, and by that standard I find this to be a great movie.<br /><br /> Definitely worth the watch, but don't expect the Jim Carrey of old.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ5250G2U795I.html">AZ5250G2U795I</a><br/><p>Eternal Sunshine is an impossible film to try to surmise, because it is an incredibly complex story that, when you try to relate it to someone, makes perfect sense to you but probably comes out sounding like you have absolutely NO idea what you are talking about.<br /><br />I will try to do it justice in this very short recap.  Joel is recovering from a breakup from his girlfriend Clementine.  The pain is mounting, when he runs into his former love and is further jarred by her inability to show him the slightest recognition.  She isn't just giving him the cold shoulder:  she has no concept who he is.  Through a mixup, Joel discovers Clementine has had him 'erased' from her memory, and he figures this to be a terrific remedy for his heartbreak.  He discovers, during the erasing process, that some memories should stay, and he and the Clementine of his mind work desperately to hide her by incorporating her into other memories of his. The way the story weaves past and present is complicated but engaging.<br /><br />What this movie does BRILLIANTLY examine is what happens to the good memories if we throw out the bad, and how intricately both are woven together.  It also questions how important are experiences we live through in terms of our destiny?  Can we really 'erase' those who fate has put in our paths?  Are the bad memories worth erasing if it means the good go with it?  These are very interesting questions 'Eternal' poses.<br /><br />And I doubt any other actor could have served 'Eternal' well as Joel.  Carrey gives a career best performance as the heartbroken Joel, and it's a performance filled with perfectly nuanced pain.  It's just captivating how Carrey gives Joel a desperation that is never whiney or pathetic.  He's just a man broken by love and looking for the quickest way out of it.<br /><br />Winslet proves she is one of the most talented actresses of her generation in a performance that makes a fairly annoying character palatable and easy to relate to.  Her Clementine would be far less easy to like in the hands of a less skilled actress, but Winslet brings a relatable bond to Clem that is not simple for such a harsh character.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NBOL825B93OM.html">A2NBOL825B93OM</a><br/><p>Once again, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman provides us viewers with an intelligent, unusual and thought-provoking story. This time, he asks us what would we do if we were presented the possibility to erase bad past experiences from our minds. Would our lives be better? Is ignorance really bliss? Or is our existence a gathering of memories and happenings, for the better or for worse?<br /><br />Kaufman's answer is given throughout the movie. I tend to agree with him; but each viewer has to watch the movie to discover his or her personal truth.<br /><br />In the movie, Joel (Jim Carrey) has a very plain and uneventful life. Very boring, indeed. Until he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet) a blue-dyed-hair girl that wants to live her life at full speed, but doesn't have the courage to do so. Her life, in fact, is pretty much like Joel's. Both of them are lonely, and, even if they are very different from each other, they start off a relationship, completing each other. But, after a time, the relationship starts to go sour, and Clementine goes to Lacuna Inc., where Joel is simply and completely erased from her memory. Joel, angry, wants to do the same, but during the procedure he has second thoughts. Most of the movie is inside Joel's head, where he struggles to keep his memories of Clementine alive, literally running from the medical probe, jumping from one memory to the next. There are other good subplots (with Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson - one of the best actors of his generation, if not THE best) that make the movie whole.<br /><br />This "inside the brain" thing is what's best in the movie, because it provides room for Kaufman and french director Gondry to toy with unusual visual scenery, shots, landscapes and scene transitions. "Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind" is not science fiction, it's not drama, neither romance, least of all comedy - as happens to all Kaufman movies, the viewer gets a little depressed, and there's a feeling of impotence during the whole story; I would classify it as a filmed question, and the finality of this movie is to answer that question.<br /><br />Good acting by Jim Carrey (almost no faces this time), but I was really surprised by Kate Winslet: the smiley, somewhat awkward "Titanic" and "Sense and sensibility" girl plays a convincent out-of society, trying-to-be-independent and sad woman.<br /><br />Grade 8.0/10</p></br><a href="../users/AXFI7TAWD6H6X.html">AXFI7TAWD6H6X</a><br/><p>I just saw "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" (...). It is one of the films that I was dying to see. I am by no means a fan of most of Jim Carrey's films but "Eternal Sunshine..." really appealed to me when I read about it in a recent issue of IFC magazine as well as saw a trailer for it. I was intrigued by the concept of having the opportunity to erase painful memories and start over with a clean slate. <p>Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet play Paul and Clementine, a couple who are in a volatile relationship. Paul is the straight guy to Clementine's unpredictable, impulsive nature. They are complete opposites. Nevertheless the pair manages to connect on an emotional level. Unfortunately the camel's back breaks and on an impulse, Clementine decides to start over on a clean slate and forget about Paul by having a memory specialist played by the talented Tom Wilkinson, erase her memories. Paul is devasted when he finds out what Clementine does so he follows suit. What happens next is a chain reaction. I got to see Paul and Clementine's relationship, the good, the bad, and the ugly through Paul's eyes. The lesson here is that we should be careful of what we wish for because it might actually happened. In Paul's case, he realized that having his memories of Clementine erased was not a hot idea. Another lesson here is learning to appreciate life and Paul figures that out just as his memories are being slowly deleted. I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline between Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson, Elijah Wood, and Mark Ruffalo. I really wasn't expecting their personal involvement with each other or with Clementine. It was enjoyable enough not to detract from the main storyline of the movie. <p>I will admit that I have never seen ADAPTATION or the entire BEING JOHN MALKOVICH (well some I have seen on Comedy Central) but ETERNAL SUNSHINE...reminded me a bit of 21 GRAMS in the way the film was shot. I really didn't understand the opening sequence to the film until towards the end of the movie. And at one point, I was confused about the way Paul and Clementine first met. I thoroughly enjoyed ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND. It is one of the most original films I have seen in years.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>What would you do if someone gave you a card that told you that they had had all memory of you erased?<p> <p>Interesting concept.  But can it work in a film?<p> <p>Well, Charlie Kaufman, who wrote Being John Malkovich wrote the screenplay and he's somewhat of a creative genius.  And Focus Features, the specialty unit of Universal Pictures that brought us Lost in Translation, Swimming Pool, The Pianist and Far From Heaven is producing it.  Then take Jim Carrey who is ready for a serious role and Kate Winslet who has won her share of acting accolades, add an excellent supporting cast and put some big bucks into creative editing and cinematography and the result is clearly one of the most imaginative films I have ever seen.  <p> <p>As I watched the film, I was totally confused.  Where was the beginning, middle and end?  There's a romance going one between Winslet and Carrey.  But how much is happening in the present, how much has happened in the past, and how much is a distorted memory?  At first I was annoyed.  I like linear stories.  I like to know where I am in time and space.  But there's no comfort of this sort in the film.  <p> <p>And yet, I loved the characters.  Even the supporting characters who were cast as employees of a company that specialized in erasing memories.  Mark Ruffalo, who I have come to appreciate for the range of his acting ability, is cast as a geek technician. Kisten Durst is cast as the receptionist and Tom Wilkinson is cast as the doctor who is willing to admit that memory erasure procedure is, in reality, brain damage.<p> <p>Some might view this as a comedy, and, indeed there are several funny moments.  But even though the film might be whimsical at times, it has a serious theme.  And the way it is put together, it is almost impossible to understand what is happening until after the film.  While it is going on there just isn't time for reflection.  Instead, as a subtext I found myself reliving some of my own memories.  They flashed though my mind in concert with what was happening on the screen.  <p> <p>Some of the scenes in the film annoyed me, others were crafted with great subtlety and sensitivity.  If I, myself, were editing it, I would have eliminated the Alice In Wonderland-style shrinking into childhood scenes.  But yet, I'm aware that they added another layer of perspective.<p> <p>The ending made the film worthwhile because it resolved what at first seemed disjointed.  And I know that this is one of those films I'd enjoy even more if I saw it again and again and again.<p> <p>Highly recommended for film buffs and anyone willing to step out of the box of perceived ideas of what film should be and experience the cutting edge of creative filmmaking.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>I started to watch Eternal "Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", and after first 15 minutes I realized I could not turn it off and drive to work (which I was supposed to do). I did what Jim Kerry's character Joel did - I called my boss and left her a message that I would be late. I stayed home and I watched the film. I cried, I laughed, I sighed, I felt - I lived through it. There are not so many films that we don't just watch but live through - for me, ESotSM was that. Finally, the Charlie Kaufman's film that I absolutely love. "Being John Malkovich" amused me; "Adaptation" irritated me - too much of Charlie in there for my taste even if he looked like Nic Cage. "Eternal Sunshine..." is Kaufman's masterpiece about relationships, memories, reality, and about intolerance, impatience, inability to listen to the others, to understand them. How easy it is to insult the one you love the most. How difficult it is to forgive yourself for that. How often we rely on the modern technology to fix our inner problems. How seldom we realize that painful and happy memories go together. You can not get rid of ones and keep the others. It may not be the best romance film ever but it is damn close. It is a tender and poignant Valentine Card that Kaufman sent to all of us - to remind us that the love exists, that relationships can survive, and even if they die, we have the memories of them, and nobody or nothing can take our memories from us. Is it just a coincidence that Kaufman references for the second time to the tragic and great love of Eloisa and Abelard in his works?<br /><br />I applaud to Michel Gondry for his brilliant directing; to the supporting cast, including Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, and Kirsten Dunst. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet played their best roles ever and I hope to see Carrey more often in the dramatic performances. But in the beginning of everything there was a word - without Kaufman's screenplay the film would not have happened. Thank you, Charlie.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>We really don't see what goes on in a person's mind.  This is the closest we get to what a person is thinking.  Charlie Kaufman's screenplay is bold and innovative.  It may leave many people confused and bewildered. But it makes sense for everything that happens when you want to get rid of someone's memories.<br /><br />Jim Carrey has proven he's not just a funny man.  He can be a serious actor worthy of Oscar consideration.  Kate Winslet is marvelous as Clementine, the girl who undergoes the procedure to erase memories of Joel.  This movie is happy, charming and unforgetable.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>This movie explores an interesting topic that will leave you thinking for a while. Based on the premise that it is possible to delete selective memories, the question pops up: is this the right way to go after a bad relationship? Keep in mind that in order for the procedure to be successful they have to delete every little memory connected to that person, so you would lose the bad recollections, but also the good ones. So, is the trade-off worthwhile?<br /><br />The film starts in a somewhat confusing way, when we see Joel (Carrey) following an impulse one morning, deciding to ditch work for the day and run off to Montauk. Once he gets there he meets Clementine (Winslet), a girl of eclectic tastes regarding her hair-style and who works at a bookstore. Not only does Clementine change his hair following her impulses, but she also does other things that way. For example the same day she meets Joel, she declares "I'm gonna marry you". As you can probably guess, we get the feeling that there is something weird going on, which is explained by the fact that these two people have met before, but have erased each other from their memories.<br /><br />Joel and Clementine had a two-year long relationship that had its good and bad times, and which was so intense that when it ended, they could not bear remembering the details of it. So they went to Lacuna and took care of the problem. Michael Gondry presents all this information using a combination of what is going on in the present and events from the past, as well as incorporating very interesting and creative scenes that show the process to which the mind is exposed to when erasing the memories.<br /><br />At some points we get to feel some anguish connected to what is happening to the main characters, and this in my mind is a reflection of how well they perform in their roles. Carrey have been showing for quite some time that he is not only a funny guy, but that he can really act, following a similar career path as Tom Hanks. For more evidence of Carrey's outstanding acting I recommend "The Majestic". In the case of Winslet, I have not been a very big fan of her, but here she excels at her role and I got the same positive impression as in "Finding Neverland". It seems that she is maturing in terms of her acting career and improving consistently. When most people see that the movie features Jim Carrey they automatically think "Comedy", and as you can guess by now, this is not the case of the present movie. As long as you are clear on that, and are not looking for laughs, I believe that you will find the experience interesting, to say the least.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>When love almost dies, we get hurt and angry and sometimes forget, that the enjoyng the good times is the other side of the coin from enduring the tough times. To give up one you give up the other. Would it be worth it? That is the premise of this imaginative film. You have to be in the right emotional place to enjoy this film.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>...is not the cleverness of the conceit, nor the ingenuity used in representing the memory erasure, nor the flashing forward and back in time, nor any of the other story-telling devices.  No, the real surprise is how sweet and touching is the love story that emerges through all of the imaginative convolutions.<br /><br />With, perhaps, Jim Carrey's most sincere and accomplished "straight" acting job, matched in full by a fine performance by Kate Winslet, we finally get beyond adroit inventiveness in a Charlie Kauffman script, and get down to some real heart: very touching and ringing true.<br /><br />Well done in all departments, it is the bittersweet longing for love in the eyes and actions of the leads that brings this film home.  4-1/2 stars.  Well worthwhile.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>Despite what one hears in the press, particularly with politicians . . that if I had it to do over I would do the same thing . . . this movie gives us a more legitimate, more honest take on the concept.  Of course, there are things that we would have liked to do differently.  And in addition, what is it that defines love of one another.  What is love, and is it something integral in ones personality . . the love of one other individual . . that can not be erased.  This picture deals with these questions, and with these concepts, in a clever, if non-conventional manner.  There is something very special about true love, and it can not be taken away.  The trimmings may not be neat and pretty, but deep down there is love, or sunshine, and in that one spot in the mind there is something spotless.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>Written by Charlie Kaufman (writer of the wonderfully bizarre "Being John Malkovich") and directed by Michel Gondry (director of many of Bjork's amazingly inventive videos), I knew I would like "Eternal Sunshine". I expected it to be clever, interesting and fun. What I didn't expect was that it would turn out to be such a touching and poignant love story as well. I'm not a big fan of Jim Carrey, but he does very well here, going against type to play a subdued character who constantly refers to himself as "not that interesting". It's actually the luminous Kate Winslet (still radiantly gorgeous, even with blue hair) who plays the zany, unpredictable one, who Jim Carrey's character is drawn to, like a moth to a flame. The story has a slight sci-fi premise to it, with the two main characters trying to erase their memories of one another and their tumultuous relationship, but this film is really about love, relationships, fate and forgiveness. Aside from the love story involving the lead characters, there's also an interesting subplot involving the employees of the "memory erasing" agency, with Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood all giving terrific supporting performances. All in all, a terrific film.</p></br><a href="../users/A23L2BR07AOBG1.html">A23L2BR07AOBG1</a><br/><p>With Michel Gondry you have a director who is interested in both making art that is visually captivating and smart. He does that continually in this film. I also have to say that because this is true of him he's the most unique director to ever have brought Charlie Kauffman's scripts to life. Since Kauffman was new to the feature film scene and so was Spike Jonze, a lot of people thought that it was Jonze who was the mastermind when he was actually just channeling the ability of Kauffman. Jonze does deserve credit for feeling that his script was important and worth doing though.  Gondry really knows how to work with Kauffman's scripts the best at this point and time.  "Human Nature" was good, but not great.  He's learned more this time around.  One thing that I noticed about the film was that he included music which had an vinyll hiss to it and sort of gave the feeling that the actions that were taking place on the screen were relived and dated which is exactly what was happening. Ingenius! I didn't notice the slight of hand visuals until the scene where Jim Carrey is remembering seeing Clementine in Barnes and Noble with Elijah Wood hiding and he walks away while the lights in the B&N turn off and he fluently walks out of the kitchen of his friends house and into their reality. The effects are like that in this movie for the most part.  Certainly there are many clues into what is happening and some of them are obvious such as the people who have no face because the memory has already been zapped.  When a memory is being zapped and the subtle things start to disappear it's because Gondry wants your focus to be on the emotional crisis at hand, but still cogniscent of the danger of the procedure. OK, I MUST STEP OUT OF MY REVIEW TO STATE TO ALL OF THE MAINSTREAM FILMGOERS THAT THIS FILM IS COMPLEX. To exemplify this, let me explain a scene. Jim Carrey's character is having his memories of his girlfriend erased in the comfort of his own home. While this procedure is taking place he is in a semi-sleeping state where he can't revive and stop it, but he visualizes the memories when they come up. He can occasionally hear the voices of the people working on the procedure and his subconscious can change his living of the memory as if he were awake while still being asleep. Multilayered, huh.? Anyway, the thing that I liked most about this film was trying figure out the relevance of the supporting characters in this film after it was finished.  I'm still thinking about it. As for Jim Carrey, he does a tremendous job and my friend who went with me didn't like him at all in any of his previous roles, serious, or funny.  She found a respect for him after watching this film. Kate Winslet was serviceable in a role that really takes a backseat in the scheme of things. When I say servicable it means she was great, it was just a serviceable role, but it was miraculous how she made the role obnoxious, difficult, profane, and yet, believably likable to Joel, the Jim Carrey character.  All of the other actors are good as well, but like I said, I'm still trying to find the significance of their very simple roles in contrast to the mind surgery of Joel.  I recommend this film wholeheartedly for people who like to watch intelligent films that aren't interested in the status quo and work outside of it, or morph it into what they want it to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>Let's see, I had no clue what this movie was about, all I knew is that it had Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, so I figured that I'd go and see it, and I remember being captivated by every second of this wonderful and rather strange film. This is possibly the best picture of the year, and has quickly become one of my favorite films of all time. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is no exercise in existential drudgery. Coming from the bizarre thought processes of Charlie Kaufman, who minted the new mind-game cinema with his "Being John Malkovich" script, "Eternal Sunshine" is as giddy as it is intellectual. And it finally delivers the role Carrey has wanted to play for the last five years. Jim Carrey heads the cast of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, directed by Michel Gondry from Academy Award nominee Charlie Kaufman's (Adaptation) original screenplay. The two-time Golden Globe Award winner is joined in the movie by threetime Academy Award nominee Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst (Spider-Man), Tom Wilkinson (Academy Award nominee for In the Bedroom), Mark Ruffalo (You Can Count on Me), and Elijah Wood (The Lord of the Rings). Joel (Jim Carrey) is stunned to discover that his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had her memories of their tumultuous relationship erased. Out of desperation, he contacts the inventor of the process, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), to have Clementine removed from his own memory. But as Joel's memories progressively disappear, he begins to rediscover his love for Clementine. From deep within the recesses of his brain, Joel attempts to escape the procedure. As Dr. Mierzwiak and his crew (Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood) chase him through the maze of his memories, it's clear that Joel just can't get Clementine out of his head. A Focus Features presentation of an Anonymous Content production in association with This is that. Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

I have loved every one of his films-"Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Human Nature, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" and now this. Out of all his films, I thought this one was the best. This was moving, funny, dramatic, and wildly inventive, all at the same time. It stars Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, and they both could be contenders at the Oscars next year, seriously. The film is a work of genius, and it's constantly entertaining, and all of the scenes work. It is not  your average Jim Carrey movie like "Bruce Almighty," and "Liar, Liar." Carrey proves once again that he could do more then physical comedy, and he already proved himself with "The Majestic" which I really liked. <p>The movie is about Joel Barish. One day he decides to skip work and take a train out to the beach. On the return trip he meets Clementine Kruczynski. They both become attracted to each other and become a couple. They are exactly the opposite of each other, and this is proved when Clementine leaves and doesn't seem to know who Joel is. Joel finds out from his friends that Clementine has had him erased from her memory, and doesn't remember ever having a relationship with him. Joel finds out that she went to Lacuna, founded by Dr Howard Mierzwiak, and he decides to go check things out. Thinking that it is a hoax, he decides to have the procedure done to him, sort of as a revenge as well. Joel meets Stan who is doing the prodedure, Patrick who works at Lacuna, and is also dating Clementine, and Mary who is the receptionist at the office, who also has a crush on Howard. Most of the movie takes place in Joel's mind, and his memories are deleted backwards. Joel goes through the most painful memories of his relationship first, and then the ones where him and Clementine had good times. He decides that he wants the procedure to stop, but the erasure team cannot hear him, so Joel and his memory of Clementine are forced to flee around Joel's mind and hide.<p>Jim Carrey is giving his best preformance yet as Joel, and I also thought that Tom Wilkinson was great as the founder of Lacuna, but he always does great anyway. "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is a movie that I feel could be up for many Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Score, and Best Orignal Screenplay, just to name a few. This is one of the best films of the year, and also probally the most inventive. I give it five stars, and I plan on getting it when it comes out on DVD. I am also awaiting Kaufman's next movie.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated R for language, some drug and sexual content.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>Strange because I watched this film on home video in Boston right after a kind of break-up. He (Boston guy) swooned over Kate Winslet and said that the concept was ridiculous. I, on the other hand, wished such a medical technology could be invented, perfected, patented, and commercialized NOW. Freeing up all sorts of support groups and therapist offices from the heartbroken and lovelorn in just one delete button to our brain. Love sears the brain no doubt. And when it goes sour it really drives us somewhat mental. But really .... would you truly want to erase the memories with someone you loved? My verdict - NO. Painful as it is these memories are still very sacred and that person very special. I still would have erased Boston guy (and New Jersey blind date guy from the previous year) in the click of a mouse but never the Toronto guy who came as a complete and welcome surprise a long while later after my Massachussetts episode.<br /><br />Joel and Clementine have their moments as a couple. Their breakup is pretty dramatic and before he knows it Celemtine has impulsively had her memory bank erased to get over Joel. In his desperation Joel seeks to do the same but somehow during the process ... he fights for every last bit of memory. He still wakes up "clear" of Clementine but fate has other plans and they meet that afternoon and start all over again. The dream sequence as Joel resists the process are psychedelic and poignant. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a touching lesson for all of us ... if love is a battlefield (quoting Pat Benetar) having battlescars is nothing to be ashamed of. It's better to have the memory of cherished love despite a permanent separation ... than to have no concept of what it means to ever give your heart and yourself away.

It's my favorite film from '04. I was eager to quickly purchase the DVD when it was first released - and I did so.<br /><br />Less than a month afterwards they announced a new 2-Disc edition, which must be the record for the shortest-ever re-release (apart from simultaneous separate editions such as the "regular" edition of Ray and the "special" edition for the die-hard fans of the film).<br /><br />At first I was very upset, and angry at the film studio for doing this. Then I saw the extra features on the 2-Disc edition:<br /><br />- Inside the Mind of Michel Gondry<br /><br />- Anatomy of a Scene: Saratoga Avenue<br /><br />- A Conversation with Kate Winslet and Director Michel Gondry<br /><br />- Deleted & Extended Scenes<br /><br />- Souvenir Booklet<br /><br />First of all, the front packaging for the new DVD is awful. It's the same as the old one, but centered, with annoying critics' reviews highlighted all over the place. Second of all, the new features are, simply put, not worth the upgrade. There's already an Anatomy of a Scene on the original disc. Once you've seen one, you get the idea. Only the most die-hard of fans would find it worth upgrading just for this. The conversation with Kate Winslet and Gondry is just as bad as teh conversation with Jim Carrey on Disc 1 - boring and not insightful at all. "Inside the Mind of Michel Gondry" was also available before and the souvenir booklet isn't anything special.<br /><br />I think this is the worst case of marketing ever. I love the movie. I'm disappointed in the DVDs - the commentary isn't very interesting, the bonus features are dull, and to my surprise the instantaneous release of the "special" edition is just as bad.<br /><br />I'd give it five stars if they hadn't tried to rip everyone off with two editions. The difference between the normal edition of Ray and the special edition is that they were announced at the same time, and put on the shelves at the same time. For those of us who bought Eternal Sunshine, we were not told until later that a Collector's Edition was going to be released - a month later of all things! - so it really upset me.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>To consider the position of Charlie Kaufman in the Hollywood universe look at the career M. Night Shyamalan.  Once you successfully trick your audience in a film they laugh and then demand that you do it again...and again...and again.  Shyamalan's latest film, "The Village," got trashed by a lot of people because it did the surprises were not good enough.  Having written "Being John Malkovich," "Adaptation," and "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," and facing the daunting prospect of doing it again, Kaufman came up with "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."  To be fair, the idea came was given to Kaufman by director Michel Gondry, who got from his friend, the artist Pierre Bismuth, the idea of getting a card in the mail that says "You have been erased from someone's memory."  But it was Kaufman who came up with the story.<br /><br />"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is much more of a love story than anything Kaufman has written before, even with the writer's twisted view.  The title is taken from Alexander Pope's poem "Eloisa to Abelard," and the story is of Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), who discovers that his ex-girlfriend Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) is not merely pretending not to know who he is, but has actually had her memories of him wiped clean.  After going through brief periods of disbelief and outrage, Joel demands that Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) wipe his memory as well.  But while he is going through the process and he relives the memories that are being erased, Joel has second thoughts.  However, since he is "under" the process what can he do to save his precious memories?<br /><br />Most of this movie takes place while Joel undergoes the process.  The procedure is taking place at an apartment rather than at the office, where Joel is supposed to be monitored by a pair of Mierzwiak's assistants.  However, Stan (Mark Ruffalo) is too busy jumping around on the bed with Mary (Kirsten Dunst) while they are both in their underwear.  Meanwhile, Patrick (Elijah Wood) has gotten a crush on Clementine and is using some of Joel's choice memories to impress her.  As his memories of the good times with Clementine are swept away one by one, Joel tries to find a way to fight back.  Then the Clementine of his memories suggests she take him into other memories where she never was so that they can hide out.  This is when Stan discovers that Joel has gone "off the map" and has to summon Dr. Mierzwiak to save the day.<br /><br />The attractive moral here is quite simple: love might be forgettable, but it is still indestructible.  Obviously this film is all about memories and the mind, but it also argues the importance of the heart.  You have to pay attention to this film because Joel Barish has become unstuck in his memories and once they start to fuse and merge things can get a bit confusing.  There are memories that are being remembered, altered, and forgotten, and sometimes they come fast and furious.  Still, I think that having cut our teeth on "Pulp Fiction," "Memento," and other films that play fast and loose with the idea of narrative chronology, audiences are more willing to except the roller coaster ride of this 2004 film than they would have a decade ago.<br /><br />Carey's performance is one of his best.  We know full well that he can do dramatic roles, but this time he is doing a markedly better job of stripping away even more of his standard mannerisms and vocal affectations, so that you have no trouble thinking this is Joel.  I actually enjoy his dramatic films more than his wild and crazy guy efforts, so I hope the actor finds the positive responses to this role encouraging.  The character of Clementine is a free spirit, but since Winslet is playing her there is a sense of weight that you would not get with another actress (e.g., Kate Hudson).  That becomes a key reason for us to hope these two find each other again, even if they do not remember who the other one is any more.  But in the end it is Kaufman's story that carries this film, which is one of the most unusual love stories you will have ever seen.  You can only wonder what Kaufman will come up with next (no idea of the plot, but the director will be Spike Jonze again as it was on "Adaptation").</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>With a title as wordy as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, you'd expect a meaty, heavy film.  But it's more than that.  Charting the story of Joel (Carrey), who upon discovering his ex Clementine (Winslet) has had her memory erased of him, decides to go through the process himself.  The only hitch is that halfway through the process, as he trawls backwards through his time with Clementine he wants to call the whole thing off.<p>It's difficult to descrive the story in full partly because it's more of a movie you have to see rather than hear described.  Suffice to say that as well as being tightly scripted by Kaufman, it's also directed with verve and passion and visually it's brilliant.  Any fans of Kaufman will absolutely love it, and in my mind this combines the wacky off-the-wall humour of Being John Malkovich with the humanity of Adaptation.  Whilst it's true that Kaufman's brand of comedy isn't perhaps as exciting as it was in Being John Malkovich, but let's face it, this is heaps better than the usual dross.  As a matter of fact, this is actually more poignant than the promotion would have you believe.  Not only is it stuffed full of literary allusions but the relationship between Joel and Clementine is sensitively drawn, as are the dynamics between the other characters.<p>The acting is also brilliant.  Carrey gives his most restrained, human performance yet, surpassing even The Truman Show with his glum, miserably, introverted Joel.  Winslet hits the big time again after a string of fantastic performances in lower budget affairs, and doesn't disappoint.  It's a credit to her that we never find Clementine annoying for a single moment.  Of the supporting players, Elijah Wood breaks out of the Frodo role by playing a loveable nerd and Mark Ruffalo shows that he can be a real asset to a film as long as he's given an interesting role.  The only real casting problem is Kirsten Dunst, who seems to have plateaued acting-wise after her dreamy performance in The Virgin Suicides.  Whilst she continues to pick good roles, she hasn't had anything to really test her for a while.<p>More than anything else though, with just a few movies, Kaufman has proved to be a big name in intelligent, interesting movies and one that can even rescue the term 'romantic comedy' from out of the doldrums.  Eternal Sunshine is near-perfect and will definitely be one of the highlights of this year's films.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>A great direction by Michel Gondry of Charlie Kaufmann's screenplay on the role of memory in relationships and heartache.  A great film with creative cinematography and decent acting by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet.<br /><br />The plot line is too convoluted to explain in this review and to do so would spoil the story.  The story is however quite creative and explores some rather complex psychological/philosophical premises as to the function of memory and relationships.  Is the memory of a departed lover merely a nuisance to one's state of mind or is it a reminder about what our subconscious minds feel is best for us?  Can we truly erase memories or do they stay with us one way or another no matter what we do.  These are some of the themes the film seems to touch upon in its plot.<br /><br />This is an interesting film typical of Kaufmann's imagination found in other screenplays by him such as 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation.'  This is a fun film to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>After watching a dozen European and Asian films, films like: In The Mood for Love and Love and Lucida, I was ready for good old American filmmaking.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind isn't overly technical with color and technical innovation, but it does have the greatest screenplay writer in the world, the great Charlie Kaufman.  Here is a writer as legendary as any actor or director. Look him up on Goggle and you'll see his amazing story.<br /><br />Jim Carey (Joel) is a likable slump and Kate Winslet (Clementine) is the pretty but troubled wild girl.  They meet, they love, they screw up, they hate each other, and they break up.  Then Tom Wilkinson, the brain doctor, erases their memory of each other.  We suspend belief because the script goes a little science fiction with the medical procedure that erases bad memories, humiliations, foolish fears, or any other unpleasantness of a lifetime.  During the procedure Joel changes his mind and he rebuilds his psyche in order to retrieve the magic in love.<br /><br />There is a secondary story.  Kirsten Dunst is playing her first adult role, a doctors' receptionist.  Her memory is erased also, so that she doesn't wreck Wilkerson's marriage.  Hmm, I see this is getting difficult to explain.  Know that this film had a decent emotional punch.  Loving another person is very difficult over a long period.  Not everyone gets the hang of it.  After all, it takes two to tango.  Paraphrasing the philosopher, Nietche:  Lucky is the human who remembers none of his or her blunders.  They are the happiest of them all.  Freud would have more to say, but I digress.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>I reacted to the movie this way...the bad and the good...or the less good and the good, because I think its a fine film.<br /><br />I started out reluctant to see it. For me, Kate Winslet has always had a kind of calculating look about her that I've never responded to except for Quills. And a little Jim Carrey, for me, goes a long way. I react to him the same way I do to Robin Williams. I like them both, but in smaller doses than I usually get. All that energy wears me out after a while, and when they try to be "serious," I think they often veer off into being mawkish.<br /><br />With that out of they way, I still didn't respond much to Winslet, but I thought Carrey did a fine job...understated, lonely, lost. Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, and Kirsten Dunst are always first rate in what they do, and they were first rate here.<br /><br />The movie itself was clever by half, but with so much more heart than Charlie Kaufman usually shows. The whole thing of being so hurt by past expectations and hopes that you want out is a powerful plot device. And I think Carrey's performance hit the bulls eye. Swinging back and forth in time, going back and forth between memories and reality, had me quickly paying attention to what was going on. I really like a movie that poses puzzles, with issues that can be figured out only if you don't doze off...and where the writer and director play fair with the audience. Memento and Usual Suspects also come to mind as good examples of this.<br /><br />I think Eternal Sunshine is Kaufman's best work, as well as Carrey's.<br /><br />One other thing...<br /><br />Carrey, I think, hits 50 in seven or eight years. It will be interesting to see if he can finally break out of his typical image (Dumb and Dumber, The Mask, etc) and become accepted as a serious, disciplined actor. He's not there yet, but he's trying. Before long I expect to see Mick Jagger and Keith Richards shuffle on stage with walkers, with the sound of their creaking joints drowning out Richards' guitar. I hope Carrey can avoid this.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UBVJEV1LLS7.html">A38UBVJEV1LLS7</a><br/><p>What a big WOW this movie was. Simple, moving, intelligent, well written, and perfectly acted, what more could one ask for?!<br /><br />I have read some reviews that said that the plot was complicated, but I must fiercely disagree; the plot is as easy to follow as it is easy to watch. Woman erases man, man wants to erase woman, man changes his mind. The real fun is in watching them escape from memory to memory in a funny, tear-jerking move to save his love from extinction.<br /><br />This movie is perfectly acted. Carrey gives, easily, his finest serious performance, and probably his best overall. One can literally see the pain in his face, which is looking its age I might add; never-the-less, for the first time I was moved by one of his performances. Other great jobs in the film were done by: Dunst (perfect for the cute, free secretary), Ruffalo (looking good in the undies), Wilkinson (in a role that nearly mimics that of _In the Bedroom_), and Wood (great as the unlikable thief). However, these, to me, pale in comparison to the superb (and hopefully Oscar winning) performance of Kate Winslet as the off the wall girlfriend with a thousand haircolors. She really blew me away (as she always does).<br /><br />See this move, bottom line. It is not just a crazy "art movie" like so many I have talked about. Just see it and you will see the beauty that is locked inside the "Mind."</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>One thing i have to say about this movie, i'm confused, what were they thinking. tthis movie could of been better and less confusing. this is not one of the best jim carrey movies i've seen. it is although a good film  i gave it  five stars only because jim carrey can turn a horribaly written story awesome and he rocks in everything he dose.</p></br><a href="../users/A29SJTG21BVWF4.html">A29SJTG21BVWF4</a><br/><p>A movie that allows us to see into our own beliefs and ethics.

WELL DONE</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>Perhaps my mistake was watching this immediately after "Stranger than Fiction," an equally overworked, derivative premise about a repressed, unfulfilled personality who requires not so much the extermination of his pedestrian self as the recovery of his more vital self (i.e. he needs the right, "spontaneous," life-endowed woman).  The prototype is Chris Marker's 1962 masterpiece, "La Jetee," a film that's as profound as it is fresh, provocative, and haunting.  The problem with these later spin-offs is not their lack of originality. Adrian Lyne's "Jacob's Ladder" is one of several films to approach "La Jetee"'s greatness.  But these most recent efforts are low-budget formula pictures with big-budget stars that unfortunately lend validity to "Chick Flick" as a dismissive term for the whole sub-genre.<br /><br />The performances are often of Oscar-worthy quality.  But I don't recall Rosalind Russell ("His Girl Friday") or Katherine Hepburn ("Adam's Rib") ever being wasted in scripts so unworthy of their talents as are Emma Thompson and Kate Winslett.  Of the two present films, "Stranger Than Fiction" is the better-made movie, but "Eternal Sunshine" is more ambitious and multi-dimensional.  The decidedly anti-intellectual message of "Stranger" is: Smelling and eating fresh-baked cookies not only satisfies the palate but heals the incomplete soul more surely than the agonized meanings of great literature.  "Spotless Mind" might be said to test this thesis by offering the viewer quotes from Nietszche ("Blessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of their blunders") and Alexander Pope ("How happy is the blameless vessel's lot/The world forgetting by the world forgot/Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind").<br /><br />The problem is that the quotes are spoken out of context, as if the characters of the film (and their creator) are clueless to the irony of the quoted statements, both of which condemn forgetfulness and deride the notion of a "spotless mind."  As if it weren't bad enough that the writers of the screenplay make mockery of Chris Marker's achievement, they misrepresent Nietszche and Alexander Pope, both of whom prefer to the sunshine of the spotless mind the mind that is alive "because" it remembers the past, however painful or imperfect it may be.  (How often I ponder the question of which is worse: the destruction of the world's great literary texts or the distorted, gross and even dangerous interpretations to which such texts, including the Bible, are subjected by tone-deaf, unimaginative, utterly "selfish" readers.)<br /><br />Both films overstay their welcome, attempting closure and not finding it. At least "Spotless Mind" provokes genuine reflection, and perhaps some minimal self-scrutiny at that.  Were the writers of the film as unashamedly didactic and verbal in their exit strategy as the makers of "Stranger Than Fiction," I would have offered them the following (by Kierkegaard):  "When one has once fully entered the realm of love, the world - no matter how imperfect - becomes rich and beautiful, it consists solely of opportunities for love."</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>One cannot help falling in love with Kaufman's scripts for their sheer boldness and eccentricity, from John Malkovich to Adaptation. <p>The "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is yet another maddeningly brilliant concept that'll make you sit up and watch, because it is scarily plausible and poignantly thought-provoking. Despite its psychological underpinnings, it is ultimately a take on love and how technology promises to break, mend, twist, and surprise our hearts and lives. <p>That description itself is reason enough for you to pick up a copy of the film as soon as you can and watch it! But unfortunately, the esoteric theme of memory erasure is dramatized with a 'different' but often unbecomingly scattershot screenplay. <p>In the end, I feel that the film comes across as being so self-absorbed in wowing viewers with a mozaic of doozy possibilities that it fails to fully connect with the audience. I would have done the movie differently but then what do I know. <p>I recommend this movie, at least once for sure, but just manage your expectations and enjoy the ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RECBDKHVOJMW.html">A1RECBDKHVOJMW</a><br/><p>Meet Joel Barish, a "nice," shy, unassuming man, played by a much understated Jim Carrey. Meet Clementine Kruczynski, a wacky, spontaneous, uninhibited woman who colors her hair as often as she brushes her teeth. Kate Winslet is brilliant here. She bounces with energy as the vibrant Clem. And Carrey gives one of his most mature, deeply felt performances as Barish. Joel and Clementine meet each other. Sparks fly. It's love. The conventional and the eccentric collide. More sparks - a veritable conflagration. And then the inevitable. Kaput! Abruptly. Painfully. Clementine wants to "wash that man right outta her hair," so she literally has him removed from her mind. Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, (Tom Wilkinson), invented a procedure to erase isolated, unwanted memories. He provides this process through his company, Lacuna. Ever unpredictable, Clementine decides this is for her. The next time the ex-couple meets, Clementine acts as if she has never seen Joel before. Joel is astounded, confused. A friend, (the very funny David Cross), finally tells Joel that he has been erased. Devastated and depressed, Joel decides to have the same procedure performed.<br /><br />Most of the film's action takes place inside Joel's head. Hooked up to the memory-erasing apparatus, which pinpoints each Clementine-related memory in his brain and zaps it, he relives every moment before it's wiped-out. The emotional sense of loss is magnified, as one memory after another is visually annihilated. Unconscious, Joel realizes these moments are far too precious to destroy. Is it too late to save them?<br /><br />"Why remember a destructive love affair?"  So asks, Dr. Mierzwiak, who presides over a hearty-partying Lacuna staff, which includes: Patrick, the unethical technician, (Elijah Wood), who uses ill-gained information to court Clementine; Mary, the ditzy receptionist, (Kirsten Dunst), who fools around with senior technician, Stan, (Mark Ruffalo), while her heart lies elsewhere. This off-beat gang of unprofessionals is responsible for the comic relief. They bring unlooked for depth to their roles also.<br /><br />Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman takes us on a roller-coaster ride through the remarkable landscape of Joel Barish's mind. This unbelievable visual collage of memories, and shifted, twisted realities, is absolutely brilliant and most memorable. The cinematography, (Ellen Kuras), is amazing! Dreams morph into reality then fade back to fantasy, while people disappear in mid-stride, as Joel's brain cells are destroyed. There are no boundaries here.<br /><br />WOW! What a whimsical, delightful, poignant, refreshing gem of a film! I laughed out loud at times, and my eyes teared-up at others. Jim Carrey and Ms. Winslet really shine and emphasize, with their performances, our very human need for love. Eternal Sunshine's premise is that we need each other, even during those periods when being together interferes with being happy. As someone once said, "love is hard." And "Eternal Sunshine" is, above all else, an original love story. The movie's title is a quotation from Alexander Pope's poem "Eloisa to Abelard:" "How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot! / The world forgetting, by the world forgot / Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind/ Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd."<br /><br />Kudos to director Michel Gondry, and Charlie Kaufman. This is one of the best films I have seen in ages!<br /><br />JANA</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>A film by Michel Gondry<br /><br />From the very creative mind of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman comes "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", one of the best movies of 2004.  The narrative is kind of disjointed, but that is par for the course with a Kaufman script.  The first scenes of the movie are really from quite a bit later chronologically, but at first we do not know quite how these first scenes fit into the story or why.  Not long into the movie we learn that Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) had a relationship, but when it ended Clementine decided to have a new procedure done which can remove a person's memories of another person (or another thing).  So, as far as Clementine now knows, she and Joel have never met.  When Joel learns about this he has the same procedure done to remove all memories of Clementine.<br /><br />At this point, the movie loses all sense of chronology, but it is makes more sense.  The following scenes are Joel's memories as they are being erased, so his unconscious is reliving the memories and remembering both the good and the bad of his relationship with Clementine.  At some point Joel decides that these are memories he doesn't want to lose.  "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is a very original look at love and relationships and what it could mean to really try and make a relationship work.  The film is uncompromising in how it reveals Joel and Clementine, but at the same time it is very tender and sweet.  Co-starring Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, and Kirstin Dunst, the movie never makes a wrong turn.  With a subject that could easily have mad a very bad movie, Michel Gondry instead makes a very good one.  In a refreshing change of pace Jim Carrey plays the straight man to Kate Winslet's far crazier Clementine.<br /><br />"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is one of the most original, well acted, and simply excellent movies of the year.  It deserves a place on any critics Top 10 list and is well worth watching.  Grade: A-<br /><br />-Joe Sherry</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is another Jim Carey movie I wasn't too sure about. He's had a better track record lately with his more serious films, so I was willing to give it a shot. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Combining all the mental hijinks of Memento and the mind-bending, "is this reality?" confusion of movies like Strange Days and eXistenz, the movie essentially posits one question: if you could erase any one experience from your mind, would you?<br /><br />But before we get to that question, we see Joel Barish (Jim Carey) meet Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) on a train. It's supposedly happenstance, and the two hit it off immediately. These first five minutes carry the whole movie. The two actors exhibit just enough nuanced familiarity that it's alternately exhilarating and creepy-they FEEL like they've known each other their entire lives. The rest of the movie then swings back to the circumstances leading up to their meeting.<br /><br />Joel has, in fact, met Clementine before and had a whirlwind romance that somewhere along the lines lost its whirl. They are strikingly different personalities who find attraction in their opposite: Joel is cautious, Clementine's a maniac. Joel is quiet (hard to believe Carey playing quiet, I know), Clementine is a bundle of energy. They alternately drive each other crazy and are crazy about each other. But unfortunately, the nature of the relationship is so tempestuous that the possibility of erasing one's memory is simply too tempting. Like a madman with a pocket nuke, it's inevitable that Clementine's personality will succumb to the lure of memory erasing...but the consequences have grave repercussions.<br /><br />Hurt and desperate, Clementine's brash decision pushes Joel to do the same thing. If she's going to erase him, well he's going to do the same thing right back at her! It's a procedure that takes an entire night and it's only a few days into the erasing of her memories that Joel realizes he LIKES his pain, his angst, his embarrassment, and even his hatred of her. The ups and downs, the good and bad parts of their relationship, are ultimately inseparable, and Joel realizes he will lose a part of his soul along with Clementine should his memory of her be erased.<br /><br />So he fights it. Thus have another plot thread, as Joel drags his memory of Clementine with him through the dark hallways of his mind. All the while, Joel is pursued in the real world by the Lacuna Memory Erasure team. Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) leads the team, a kindly father figure who is not nearly as nice as he seems. Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood) assist the good doctor, making an on-site visit to Joel's house. Which is at least as horrifying as it is comedic, because while Joel is in a drugged coma on his bed, Stan and Patrick eat his food, drink his beer, get high, and practically have an orgy in his apartment.<br /><br />Like Memento, Spotless Mind posits that when people aren't looking, the ethics of society don't just fall apart, they explode...whatever you imagine people might do to you while you're helpless is just the tip of the iceberg. Patrick proves just who unethical he is when we discover he has decided to take advantage of Clementine by recycling all of Joel's memories-memories that were supposedly destroyed to complete the erasure process.<br /><br />As if that weren't enough, Dr. Mierzwiak's assistant Mary (Kirsten Dunst), is dating Stan. The secret she uncovers about herself and her work will shatter the Lacuna program and the lives of all those who it touched.<br /><br />The director takes an innovative twist on how he conveys the dream world. Images become faded and indistinct. Sound crackles in and then whispers away. Some scenes appear to be lit exclusively by a flashlight, perfectly representing the selective memory of Joel's mind. Other scenes are lensed in distinct colors of yellow and blue. Still other scenes are nightmarish-people are faceless, bodies slide off into darkness, and as Joel's mind stumbles under the technological assault, structures and people literally collapse in front of him.<br /><br />Ultimately, it's Charlie Kaufman's writing that perfectly blends what could be a horrible mess. Just when you think all the various plotline could not possibly be resolved...we're back at that train, and the thrill and awkwardness of that first attraction.<br /><br />Spotless Mind is about the maturation of a romance and the decision every couple must go through when they realize that the "honeymoon is over." Joel and Clementine come to a crossroads and stumble horribly astray, just as so many couples fall apart every day without the benefit of erasing the memories of their exes. Love, Kaufman seems to say, is about the person you are after the honeymoon is over.<br /><br />Carey is suitably restrained, which makes him seem all the more pathetic when the movie focuses on the happier, more energetic times. His hair is a mop top, is sweaters always rumpled. In short, he's a sad sack that Carey captures perfectly...a funny man who has nothing to laugh about.<br /><br />Dunst plays a perfectly awkward, clueless young girl dealing with a technology she does not understand. Her characters growth, destruction, and rebirth steals the show. The other characters are suitably dazed and confused, not the least of which is Wood's not-Frodo-anymore Patrick. He's so fresh-faced, it's hard to believe he's doing such disrespectful things to Clementine.<br /><br />But by far, Winslet plays the most compelling character of her career. Winslet not only adopts an American accent, she plays Clementine as herself (a sometimes whiny, neurotic mess), as Joel remembers her (erotically playful, maddeningly confusing, and sometimes just a shrew), and as echoes of Joe's memories. This is a lot to pull off for anybody, but Winslet never missed a beat.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest compliment I can give this movie is that I KNOW these people. See it, and you will too.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JZ5L52FM318H.html">A3JZ5L52FM318H</a><br/><p>The Film:<br /><br />I won't wax too rhapsodic about the movie itself. Others have done so effusively. I can say, without reservation, that this is my personal favorite film of all time. I have watched it a good 10 to 15 times, and it rewards me upon each viewing. I think it's one of the most affecting, well-observed, and *real* portrayals of a relationship ever committed to celluloid. The structure of the story is inordinately clever, and the performances are superb.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />What I am reviewing here is the blu-ray edition. I have owned and watched the DVD since its release. So 14 of 15 viewings were in 480p, and now my 15th was in a new 1080p transfer. This is an upgrade, certainly. Detail, color, and contrast are quite a bit stronger than the DVD transfer. There is nothing that takes away from the presentation generally, such as edge enhancement or obtrusive Digital Noise Reduction. It is not competitive with some of the best Blu-Ray material on the market today, but this owes more to the soft, dreamy, somewhat hazy filming style, than to any technical deficiency of the disc. Don't get me wrong - this looks better than the best cable or satellite HD. It is just middling in terms of Blu-Rays. You shouldn't be getting this in order to "demo" your new A/V setup. You should be getting this because you love the movie.<br /><br />The extras are a direct port from the DVD. If it was there, it's here. None are upgraded to higher resolution, but this is to be expected. There are no new extras. The extras are quite good, it should be said (with the exception of the short EPK "documentary"), so it's nice that none have been dropped.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I gave this 4 stars because it's not the sort of "home run" upgrade that simply demands to be purchased no matter what editions you already own (DVD to BD upgrades in this category include 2001, Fight Club, Star Trek The Original Series). Instead, this is a competent Blu-Ray that, while it definitely improves on the previous transfer, is not the sort of revelatory experience that the aforementioned discs represent. The lack of new extras make this less of a value proposition, too.<br /><br />If you don't own it already, then definitely buy this one. If you are only a minor fan and own the DVD, stick with that. If you're a huge fan (as I am), then go ahead and get it, but wait for a good deal. I'm very happy with my purchase, but can't help but feel that this film might have deserved a bit more window-dressing.</p></br><a href="../users/A51IK68MWKV5R.html">A51IK68MWKV5R</a><br/><p>Surprising enough, given the inclinations of his doppelgangers in the films he has written, I think Charlie Kaufman truly understands love. This is, in fact, quite obvious upon watching Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. <p>In the first scene, we see Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) skip work impulsively and take a Long Island train to Montauk. There he sees Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) and they have a cute, though uncomfortable, meeting scene. But in a Kaufman film, nothing is as it seems, and we soon realize that this is not the first time Joel and Clementine have met. In fact, they have just ended an unhappy love affair and chosen to have each other erased from their memories. <p>This is only the first time switch that we will be presented with. But the beauty of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is that the film is not hard to follow. The memory-erasing process is not remotely science-fiction in its presentation and is explained within the context of the story. Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) operates Lacuna, Inc. with help from eraser Stan (Mark Ruffalo), his girlfriend Mary (Kirsten Dunst) the receptionist, and co-eraser Patrick (Elijah Wood). When Joel discovers through a friend that Clementine has had him erased, he vindictively goes to do the same, but then realizes--right in the middle of the process--that perhaps even bad memories are better than no memories at all. <p>I'm always very impressed by films that use special effects to enhance the storyline instead of substituting for it. The scene in Amelie where she melts is a perfect example. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the same way. While Joel is having his memory erased, we are taken through scenes from his and Clementine's relationship and we watch as the memory is erased bit by bit. One scene in a bookstore is particularly effective as the titles on the books begin to fade until the shelves are filled with white. In other scenes, people's faces will turn unrecognizable, giving the whole thing an eerie effect. <p>Charlie Kaufman is undoubtedly one of the more original screenwriters Hollywood has working today. So far, the four films (not including Confessions of a Dangerous Mind) he has released have been directed by only two different directors--Spike Jonze and Michel Gondry--and they both began by directing music videos. I think this is an example of the kind of cinematic vision that it takes to interpret Kaufman's work. Michel Gondry directs Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind with a sure eye for the material, something that was missing from their previous collaboration, Human Nature. <p>The cast is uniformly excellent. Jim Carrey loses his usual antics entirely, even when playing a four-year-old version of himself. I hope he has stopped "trying" to win an Academy Award, because this may be the year he takes it. Kate Winslet is a little out of her element as Clementine but she pulls it off wonderfully by just letting the script tell her what to do. Kirsten Dunst is becoming the go-to girl for fully ripe portrayals--she uses her body to its best advantage (there is a long scene where she is only wearing a T-shirt and panties), but as long as it's okay with her, it's okay with me.  And it is really quite a relief to see Elijah Wood playing a decidedly non-heroic role. I had not seen Mark Ruffalo before--though I heard a lot about his work in You Can Count on Me--but he is truly solid, even a standout among this stellar cast. <p>I've had to hold back on the description of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind because a lot of the joy is in discovery and going along in the story with the characters. But, by all means, you must see it. It is Kaufman's best film yet--it may be his masterpiece, and I really liked Adaptation. If he continues to improve as he has been, we are really in for a show ten or twenty years down the road.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>I read all of the 4 star reviews and raves for this film but was still a little leary of Jim Carrey's ability to pull this off. Well, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind main star may be billed as Jim Carrey, but it's true star is Michael Gondry, the director. This film is best described as an acid trip, a bad case of deja vu and a nightmare rolled into one. The story centers around the relationship between an introverted, lonely man Joel (Jim Carrey) and a spontaneous, vivacious extrovert named Clementine (Kate Winslet). They meet by chance and fall in love and then hit some hard times which leads the impulsive Clementine to have her memories of Joel erased by a company called Lacuna. Once Joel realizes this, he decides to have his memories of Clementine erased from his memory. Much of the duration of the film is spent as the doctor tries to erase Joel's memories of Clementine, while Joel realizes (as the process is going on) that he's made a big mistake. Joel and Clementine try to escape to a part of Joel's brain where they can't be detected so that Joel can keep his precious memories of her. Carrey gives a fantastic understated performance, while Winslet continues to impress with every role she takes. Eternal Sunshine does shine brightly because of the impeccable, flawless direction of Michael Gondry. Simply put, you have never seen another movie like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and you never will after it. This movie will resonate in your brain and haunt you...in a good way. A monumental achievement. Highest Recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Very rarely does a film come around that is so utterly flawless I have absolutely nothing negative to say in its behalf.  `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is that movie.  From start to finish, from its script to its cast to its brilliant direction, `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is fantastic, engaging, entertaining and most of all genuinely refreshing, unique and completely original and that is a facet of film that is very rarely attached to a motion picture.  All to often the same concept is revisited time and time again with different actors but the same story is being told, and while the underlining moral behind this film, of the haste in action and the reversal of consequence, I can't say has never been broached I can honestly say it's never been exploited with such sheer brilliance and most likely never will again.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Joel, played by Jim Carrey in his finest performance to date, a man who falls in love with a woman any man would be lucky to find.  Clementine is funny, spunky and sincere, nothing like anyone Joel or maybe even the movie going public has ever met and immediately he is absorbed and content in her light.  Everything is going perfect, going as expected.  They love, they fight, they live and they repeat.  They have a normal, healthy relationship until one day when Clementine doesn't remember Joel.  Joel soon finds that Clementine had a procedure done to erase him from her memory and so in haste he decides to do the same only to realize partway through the process that his best memories are of her.  He struggles to save her, hide her away in the corners of his mind and his fight is so remarkable and heartbreaking to watch.<br /><br />Director Michel Gondry is a masterclass of a director, and here he is so remarkably in tune with his characters and their surroundings that every scene jumps from the screen and into our skin.  Every scene, every prop is a perfect compliment to the actors and dialog and chemistry that just illuminates and oozes forth with utter satisfaction.  The cast is also at the top of their game.  As I mentioned Carrey himself gives us the best performance of his career breathing so much maturity coupled with adult naivety into Joel that he becomes the man we know or perhaps even are.  Winslet though is a revelation as Clementine giving one of if not the best individual performance of the past decade.  Her character is not an easy character to create let alone master yet she effortlessly becomes Clementine and thus we become enthralled in every scene she accompanies.  The mere fact that Kate Winslet is nothing more than `Oscar Nominated' infuriates me to no end, but that is for another discussion.<br /><br />The supporting cast of talented actors is flawless.  Kirsten Dunst is charming and fun and Mark Ruffalo is brilliant as always.  Even Elijah Wood, an actor I've never really felt owned it, surprised me and put in a great performance despite its lack of length.  Plus, any movie with the great Tom Wilkinson is worth its weight in gold, and the subplot involving his infidelitious doctor is a great asset to the film.<br /><br />`Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' dissects the most common of problems, human relationships, and does so with such grace and candor that the audience is involved and invested in every second of running time.  It beautifully captures the very real feelings of pain, abandonment and despair and the very childish ways that we as adults so often deal with those feelings and then of course the negative affect they have and our humane struggle to correct the problem before we're forced to live with it.  Charlie Kaufman's script is perfect, not a flaw in sight, and the casting of Winslet and Carrey in the leads was genius.  Neither of these actors, despite their rich resume, has ever accomplished what they have with this film as far as depth and richness of character.  `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' may have been snubbed the Oscar for Best Picture, heck, it wasn't even nominated, but it proved to me to be the best picture of that said year and maybe even of many years that precede and proceed.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>The bottomline about this film is that I DIDNT FEEL IT. I'm a very curious guy so when I was told there is something so insanely mesmerising about this film, I saw it again and even after watching it twice, I failed to feel it. This film is self conscious, stuckup, morally confused and pretty badly edited. I found two scenes in this film which tried to be very thunderous but failed miserably at evoking any sort of amusement or "whoa" out of me, except the original intented intent.I did not sleep during this film. It isnt the worst film I have ever seen. I'd still give it a four.<br /><br />All this is my opinion. Try not to knock on me.<br /><br />Do I hate it? I seldom use such strong words, but Yes, with every beat in my "Man On the moon" loving, Jim Carrey Fan HEART.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KT1GWCW8F80.html">A1KT1GWCW8F80</a><br/><p>I knew nothing about this movie ahead of time, but I am really happy I got it. It has been labelled as a "romantic-comedy" in nearly every other review, but I do not see it that way. Romantic, yes, but comedy, no. Although it has some humorous aspects, it is more a drama with tinges of fantasy and low-key science fiction. This movie can be partially described with "uns":<br /><br />Un-conventional -<br /><br />Odd use of lighting which is very harsh in many instances, including a lot of use of a single spotlight. Sets with forced-perspective. Snow-covered beaches.<br /><br />Un-usual -<br /><br />Odd subject matter (erasing memories). Fantasy transitions between sets - one example is Jim Carrey exits a bookstore directly into a friend's apartment. Transitions to past/present/future within a relationship. In one scene, Carry is playing two versions of his character in the same scene, requiring him to quickly change clothes behind the camera.<br /><br />Un-characteristic -<br /><br />Kate Winslet (with American accent) plays the typical Jim Carrey-type extroverted role, while usual physical-comedian Jim Carrey's character is somber and introverted.<br /><br />Un-predictable<br /><br />You don't know what is coming next.<br /><br />This is a complex movie that will reward the viewer with new details on multiple screenings. Many special effects (or tricks, actually) make it visually captivating. The acting is great and entertaining. The story is interesting and thought-provoking.<br /><br />Currently sits at #33 on IMDB's list.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>This was my weekend for non-linear movies, as I saw both this film and "The Grudge" on DVD.  The latter film was pretty good, but "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" really stood out for me.  It had the usual Charlie Kaufman cleverless (actually, this is probably his MOST clever screenplay to date), but that trademark cleverness was- more so than ever before- acting in the service of some very human, emotional themes.  By the way, a concise little 11-minute "making of"/cast & crew interview piece (one of the DVD extras) nicely sums up those themes for those who don't easily get their arms around offbeat, non-linear fare like this.  But honestly, the movie isn't all that hard to follow and understand, so don't let it scare you off.</p></br><a href="../users/AXQ8T2D9IT6UG.html">AXQ8T2D9IT6UG</a><br/><p>"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!", says a poem. But how much truth can we find there?. What if we could erase our bad memories of a romance gone sour?. Would we be happier, or would we just lose the benefit of experience, and the good memories along with the bad ones?. Of course, posing these questions seems far-fetched, so strange that many people wouldn't even think about it if it weren't for the fact that "Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind" brings to the fore the possibility of starting anew, and not in a metaphorical sense :)<br /><br />That is as a matter of fact exactly what Clementine (Kate Winslet) does on an impulse, after a particularly awful fight with her boyfriend, Joel (Jim Carrey). Afterwards, Joel doesn't understand why Clementine pretends not to know him, until he discovers she has had an operation to "erase" him. When he confronts the doctor who performed the operation, he decides to undergo the same procedure. But as the operation begins, and his memories start to fade, Joel begins to realize that he wants to remember his good moments with Clementine, even if that means keeping the bad ones too. As a result, he endeavors to hide his memories with her in parts of his brain that weren`t supposed to be wiped by the machine that the doctor manipulates. But will he succeed?.<br /><br />There are some secondary characters that are quite interesting, for example the unethical technician (Elijah Wood) that helps to wipe memories, and that starts dating Clementine after her operation. However, the best thing this movie offers is the great performances given by Carrey as an introspective and shy Joel, and Winslet as a loveable yet really eccentric woman who changes the colour of her hair to suit her whims. The director (Michel Gondry) and the scriptwriter (Charlie Kaufman) also made a wonderful job of showing us the dynamics of Joel and Clementine's relationship, and of making the spectator believe that what was happening was real...<br /><br />On the whole, I can say that I loved this movie. The central themes are easy to relate to, because they have to do with feelings we all have experienced at some point in our lives: love, loss, anger, disappointment, the need to start all over again... "Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind" entertains you, but it also makes you think. It isn't a comedy, and it isn't a drama, but it is certainly the kind of film I can strongly recommend you to see....<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></br><a href="../users/A3FVAWZNKW9GX.html">A3FVAWZNKW9GX</a><br/><p>I expected more from "Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind." Some great actors are in it, the plot sounds compelling on several levels, and it was written by one of Hollywood's best.<br /><br />It has a wonderful menagerie of intriguing elements: psychological drama, philosophical and ethic layers, complex love stories, greed, honesty, manipulation, and questions of destiny, reality and time. What doesn't it work? What happened?<br /><br />The idea of this film was bigger than those who put it together.<br /><br />The Idea<br />Adventurous girl (Clementine) meets shy boy (Joel).

However, as he goes through the messy breakup, and back into the good times, he realizes he loves her.<br /><br />Joel struggles the entire time asleep, as he has a sense of what is happening and desperately wants to save the relationship. Clementine too, although in Joel's mind, wants the relationship and understands the issue of his memory being erased. She does not see the same urgency, frustrating Joel.<br /><br />The ultimate conflict becomes saving the relationship. Can Joel find a solution, will he be able to in time even though various hurdles are before him, and what would the relationship look like when he wakes up?<br /><br />I had a difficult time following which reality, and what time and place things were happening. During the time inside Joel's memory, I became lost, and did not know what I was seeing. We see Joel as a child, as a man-child, at different events of his relationship with Clementine, and events would be different from the one I though was reality. On paper, this whole process is interesting, but, on screen, I had a hard time keeping up.<br /><br />Secondary plot lines are loose, at best, and could be removed without affecting the strength of the movie. Their presence, in fact, adds to the confusion, as I did not understand why certain characters were acting the way they did.<br /><br />For example, Stan, the technician overseeing Joel's memory erasure brings along his assistant Patrick, and they both pillage Joel's home for snacks and drinks while Joel is there asleep mid-procedure. Mary, Stan's girlfriend and receptionist at the clinic, comes by she and Stand smoke some pot. A lack of class and ethics I understand, but how this happens is the confusing part. Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, the brilliant, though staid, doctor who invented the procedure tolerates it all when he comes by to help out. He must have smelled the pot, and otherwise saw the pandemonium that had ensued. He himself seems largely professional, and yet never comments on their actions.<br /><br />The movie has good points.<br /><br />Kate Winslet demonstrates an amazing American accent. I forgot she was British. Her skills here were underused. The producers could have saved money with a more stereotypical actress like Drew Barrymore. Barrymore has played similar characters before.<br /><br />Jim Carrey shows us he has more chops than just as an incredible comedic physical actor. His dramatic personality here was key to my interest in the movie.<br /><br />Elijah Wood (he played Patrick), most known for his part as Frodo Baggins in LOTR, keeps stretching himself. His part was inconsequential to the plot, and a secondary plot about his efforts to woo Clementine was not seriously developed.<br /><br />"Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind" is a well-reviewed movie, and is worth seeing. The question of memories and how we should manage a broken heart is good to ponder, and the movie will help you get there. Its unorthodox approach might not bog down other viewers as is did for me, so give it a shot. It isn't nearly as forgettable as Clementine hoped Joel would be.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Eternal Sunshine is a waky movie with a great cast. It's good to see Carrey in something where he's not talking out of his butt.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>This movie seems to want to throw everything at you but the kitchen sink... actually staring at the kitchen sink would have been more entertaining ... and call it entertainment.  The movie had an interesting premise which was clouded and ruined by being over-eventful and consisting of a relationship between a shy man and a woman who clearly has a personality disorder, probably Borderline Personality Disorder.  If this relationship were examined in a more straightforward manner, without all the gags and tricks and minor characters trying to steal the show every second, the raw and bittersweet facts of such a relationship might have been affecting.  I once dated a woman with a similar personality disorder and so I found myself remembering how superficially charming and how difficult to disengage oneself from such people can be.  THIS is an interesting premise.  But it was as if the film-makers did not trust in their own premise enough to leave it to stand on its own feet and instead had to dance around it in such dizzying circles that it was entirely obscured.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>What an excellent, excellent movie. Jim Carrey (Joel) dominates the screen in probably his best serious role yet. Basically, he meets a girl, and they fall in love. Well, trouble brews between them, and the girl, Clementine, decides to erase all memory of Joel. Finding out about this, Joel decides to go through with the procedure himself. Halfway through Joel fights desperately to keep his memories of Clementine alive because he doesn't want to forget her. The best part of the movie is inside Joels mind as he tries to hold on to the memories he has left. Cinematography plays a HUGE role in effectively showing Joels mind, and in the beginning it seems kind of creepy as everything is kind of shadowy and dark. It is a great way to symbolize our thinking onto the big screen. During the end, the plot goes a little awry, but eventually fits into the end story. I believe the weakest moments of this film are when the movie goes to the scenes that focus on the people performing the memory erasure. Elijah Wood is also in the movie, which kind of ruined it for me because i still see him as Frodo from the Lord of the Rings. I feel that movies have more of a realistic quality when the actors are people I don't know. Sure Jim Carrey is someone I know, but he plays the part so well that he doesn't ruin the movie. So because of these small flaws i listed, Eternal Sunshine gets a 4 out of 5. It is definately a great movie to watch, and is quite moving at some points. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do so when it comes out to rent, or to buy. A fantastic movie all around that really makes you think at parts.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>Interestingly, as the film scripts of Charlie Kaufman have gotten praised through the roof over the last several years, with comparisons ranging to Herman Mankiewicz, Robert Towne, Paul Schrader, and Paddy Chayefsky- at least in terms of recognizability, most writers I have known have been far less impressed with his solipsistically obsessed screenplays than the general public.<br />  I think that is because that any reader of fiction or poetry in the last 40 or so years has been so inundated with puerile post-modernism that self-referential tautologies fail to impress. This is the fourth CK-scripted film I've seen and easily the best film was that he adapted from an outside source- the film of Chuck Barris's autobiography Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind- directed by George Clooney. That's because, given the source, CK was forced to stay on track and not veer back into his own ego like the Titanic to the-  You get what I mean. His first filmed screenplay, Being John Malkovich, was a cute humorous fable- not too deep, nor too troubling. His second scripted film, Adaptation, was merely a banal recapitulation of themes laid out in the first film, yet with the added baggage of destroying a potentially interesting film with a last third larded with the neuroses of writer's block raised to epopee. No, not really, but the attempt was embarrassing. Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind explores similar areas of memory and mind far better, although the film has some notable flaws. I grade it as a 75 out of 100- good, but nowhere near the great rankings many critics bestowed upon it....However, this is still the best CK film based on his original script. The problem is that his `original' scripts are all mere slight tangents on the same tired theme. Too bad, because a better, more original screenwriter would have laid the template for a truly great film, not just a muddling repeat viewing of a maculate mind unlighted.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a critics darling and hit movie on DVD but I couldn't stand this film and I really tried to understand why this film is so special. Kate Winslet's Oscar nominated performance is reason alone to watch this over-analytical comedy. Winslet is a fearless and unique actress, Jim Carrey and Mark Ruffalo are also good, I just wish Kristen Dunst wasn't in this, she's a one-trick pony! Eternal Sunshine... left me clouded and confused, pass this one up!</p></br><a href="../users/ALG7QH2L5JL2L.html">ALG7QH2L5JL2L</a><br/><p>The premise is intriguing. Girl gets tired of a declining relationship and has all memory of boyfriend erased. Boyfriend finds out and decides he can't live with that: gets himself erased as well. In the middle of the procedure, which he experiences as a kind of dream, he becomes lucid, realizes what's going on and decides he doesn't want this to happen. But it's too late; despite all his efforts his memory is erased. Fate in the shape of an accidental post-erasure meeting and the other actions of other characters involved twists the plot around and brings them together again.<br /><br />The cast: a director's dream. Jim Carrey, Kate Winslett, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo. How can you go wrong? Well, you can, and something did. I've been trying to work out what, because there are so many factors that nuked this movie.<br /><br />First of all what went right: Carrey and the rest of the cast were amazing, even if most of them never got a chance to actually evince what you might call 'depth of character'.  Carrey and Winslett do get that chance in the first part, where 'Joel' and 'Clementine' meet again, and those few minutes alone make the movie worth watching; after that it's mostly downhill: the story falls apart in the same way that 'Being John Malkovich' ultimately does, except that here at least the story has somewhere to go, though the writer, director and editor seem to have no idea about how to get there, but ultimately fumble themselves through to an ending.<br /><br />There were some elements with incredible potential: for example the whole dream-like erasure process, with the built-in flashes of lucidity, followed by lapses back into non-awareness. Anybody who's had lucid dreams will recognize the process. Then there's what amounts to a mental chase and battle of wits, as Joel tries to hide his memories in places where the hi-tech backed pursuit cannot find it. The whole thing throws up a whole plethora of troublesome questions related to cognitive research and philosophy, and especially the nature of 'identity'. The suffocating predicament Joel got himself into (by surrendering control of his mind to someone else) and can't get himself our of. The twists and turns of contingency as, despite all this, it all appears to turn out all right.<br /><br />The flaw at the heart of this movie is that someone forgot what story to tell, and instead tried to tell too many, and in the process the movie lost its soul. The editing completed the job that the directing started. It was so VISIBLE as to become detrimental to the actors: in its contrived cleverness it erased much of the depth they could have brought to the characters. Sometimes I had the feeling that there actually WAS something more to this moment or that; but then it usually got zapped, as if the editor was chasing that precious something down like Stan was doing to Joel's memories.<br /><br />The cinematography was trying to be so clever that one could almost touch it. In conjunction with the awful editing, almost every 'cut-to' became a painful jarring of this viewer's attempt to relate to the story and the characters, and made the thing into a cinematographic, rather than an emotional experience.<br /><br />Without this, maybe the other problems of the movie would have been non-existent. I don't know, because the movie is as it is, and we can play 'what if' games forever and speculate into a vacuum. But I'd like to think that maybe in the hands of someone less keen to 'make a movie' and more interested in people and telling a story, we might actually have some emotional understanding of why Joel and Clementine needed to be together, and why it was right that in the end they were. Don't misunderstand me: give me ANY reason for an upbeat ending and I'll embrace it joyfully. So why, in this instance, did I feel that the ending was tacked-on, contrived, artificial? The back-together-despite-all-the-odds simply rings false, if only because the only reason why they are is contingency, sheer dumb luck, twists of fate. They get a second chance and maybe they'll work it out this time. But did they do anything to earn it? In particular, did Clementine, who evinces no sign of actually thinking that there was something wrong with her method to opt out of a situation with the minimum of pain? Do these people actually love each other, and if they do, is that love enough or shown as even indicatively sufficient to bridge the gap they've created in their past and through their actions of surrendering their power of their minds to someone else?<br /><br />Finally, there is something offensive about the general attitude by director and editor towards the actors: in this case a dream-cast, whose potential was mostly edited out of existence. There is a school of film-makers who see actors as a kind of cinematographic element, like a piece of landscape or a prop. As long as they perform the correct motions and say the right things at some time or during some take, there's probably a way to edit it together so that it looks right. That's OK if the actors actually need such treatment. There is another school who believes that actors are to be considered not just essential, but next to the director the dominant visible participants in any decent story-telling process. To demean them into becoming just pieces in a mosaic of self-important film-making is degrading. That Carrey, Winslett and the rest of the cast still manage to shine is a testimony to their professionalism and consummate skill. That aspect was the one truly bright spark in an otherwise disappointing flick.<br /><br />Till Noever, Author: KEAEN, www.owlglass.com<br /><br />2/5 purely because of the actors</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>I would be telling untruths if I were to say that I enjoyed this film.  Regrettably, it did not live up to my expectations.  This view being despite the fact that its screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, was responsible for "Being John Malkovich", a wonderfully magic yet funny film that I rate very highly.  "Spotless Mind" is a very different film in that it tried to take itself much too seriously.<br /><br />Over the years, it has been my observation that Jim Carrey, the lead in "Spotless Mind", is more highly regarded in America than he is elsewhere.  Americans seem to regard him as a genius while non-Americans see him as largely a slapstick actor.  I fall into this latter category.  Carrey's role is not one of humour in this role, yet he still fails to capture the imagination.  His hype precedes him.<br /><br />In brief, the film covers a process whereby one's immediate memory of a particular person or event can be erased.  Carrey's girlfriend, played by Kate Winslet, has the procedure down to eradicate Carrey (Joel) from her memory.  In retaliation, Joel does the same for his girlfriend.  In the middle of the process, however, he has second thoughts and tries to reverse or evade the changes.  He desperately tries to cling to his lover.  His memories become precious.  Identity tries to override deceit and revenge.<br /><br />I am very glad that I have now seen this film if only to understand other people's views.  However, I am unable to encourage others to follow my lead.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>..it's pretty lame.  In spite of all the kudos this movie has received, ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is one of those "artsy" movies that brags on its own originality, but fails to really address the issues at hand:  you may be able to erase a person's memories, but you cannot erase the feelings that person has.  This is proven not only in the main storyline with Joel and Clementine, but in the secondary plot featuring the impressionable Mary who thinks that the work of her idol Howard is so wonderful.  We later find out that her heroic doctor has been "playing" her like a fiddle, too.  We first meet Joel as he skips a day from work and goes off on an adventure where he runs into the blue-haired Clementine.  There's the slightest hint that they've "met before", and by the time the opening credits roll, we see a disgruntled and angry Joel finding out that Clementine has had a procedure done to "erase" her memories of Joel and she's on to a new life with a new boyfriend.  A hurt Joel decides to have the procedure done, but as it is being performed, he finds his memories aren't as awful as the thought and he tries to stop the procedure.  Of course, by the end, both Joel and Clementine realize they made a mistake in having the procedure done, but we also realize that even though they want to try and make it together again, the same things that caused them to split in the first place are still there and they will more than likely appear again.<br /><br />I didn't find the script all that enticing, it's manipulative and much of what goes on is predictable and forced.  As for the acting, Jim Carrey takes a dramatic leap but I found myself thinking, "This is Jim Carrey trying to show us he's a serious actor and not just a manic Ace Ventura."  Kate Winslet's performance, while professionally done, pales in comparison to her work in "Finding Neverland," and she should have gotten her oscar nomination for that film instead of this one in which she merely seems to be "acting."  Elijah Wood looks painfully out of place in his role as the lovestricken Patrick, again like an actor who is saying "Don't just think of me as Frodo."  Ironically, it is in the performances of Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkinson, that the heart of this movie is evidenced.  Ruffalo is marvelous as the programming geek with the hots for an unsuspecting Dunst; Dunst, meanwhile, uses her adolescent charms gamely and does a real reversal when she finds out what's happened to her; and Wilkinson exudes a calm confidence and vulnerability as the mastermind behind Lacuna, which is the memory erasing company.  The film offers some great visual effects as Carrey's memory is being erased, but by the time the deed is done, so much posturing and padding has crippled the movie.<br /><br />I'm sure all of the afficionados of this vastly overrated film will hit their "No" buttons by now, but as always, it's not whether one agrees with the film, but if one can find something that helped them make up their own minds about this movie.  I found it too manipulative and artsy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an intriguing title, kind of surreal and postmodernist.  The film's premise is also intriguing: you can have painful memories of a bad relationship erased; but once you make that choice, you may not want to go through with it.<br /><br />Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, who has given us Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Eternal Sunshine.  Stars Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are wonderful, as are all the supporting cast, which includes Kirsten Dunst (at last breaking out of her Mary Jane role!).  Carrey plays Joel, an introverted man in love with impulsive blue/green/red-haired Clementine, played by Kate Winslet.  I have to say, her American accent is scarily perfect (Are we that easily imitated?  I will have to work on my British accent).<br /><br />Joel and Clem are very different people, and their differences soon begin to rub the relationship raw.  Clementine decides to have her memories erased at a company called Lacuna.  From this point on, the film becomes more confusing, convoluted, and complicated than intriguing.<br /><br />The film's basic message is as Carrey put it in the extras:  you can't help but love who you love.  You can make it work despite your differences.  It may sound profound, but it is not.  Joel is dreary and boring, Clementine is shallow and silly.  To put viewers through all this to arrive at this message makes trying to understand the movie more work than entertainment.  After I watched the film with my husband, I was so frustrated as to why the film had two completely different beginnings, and why the end was so confusing, that I watched the entire film again with commentary.  I just wanted to relax for a couple of hours, but this ended up like a study session, work, not fun.<br /><br />In the extras, even Jim Carrey says he and Winslet had to "constantly ask in what time frame" they were doing a scene.  Kaufman comments that many people told him the film was "too complicated," but he basically shrugs and brushes them off.  The French director casually mentions that viewers will "get it the second . . . third . . . or fourth time they see it."  Hey, I don't know about you, but I don't like to pay to have my intelligence insulted.  Another thing that was unrealistic is that Clementine had outrageous, brightly-colored hair, but tasteful, demure, professionally applied makeup.<br /><br />To look at a different movie with a secret, many saw the Sixth Sense and didn't "get it."  But that movie's twist was truly original, and big.  Eternal Sunshine is just about two people who are attracted to each other, but who lack relationship skills.  If Joel and Clem were your downstairs neighbors, you would be like "oh, God, THAT COUPLE is fighting again!!!" To look at Clementine, she wasn't a very likeable character.  Several times in the film she boozes it up, and crows "Yay, ALCOHOL!" I have a friend who is an alcoholic, and I don't think Clementine's borderline alcoholism is funny or endearing.  Clementine is also impulsive and reckless, even dragging Joel onto a frozen lake.  That is dangerous.  Clementine is cute, but she only lives for the moment.<br /><br />How many friends or relatives do you have who are in a bad relationship, and whine to you over the phone about it until you want to scream?  How many bad relationships have you been in?  Are you in one now?  There is nothing profound about the basic message of this film if you are looking at these two characters, Joel and Clementine.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEJIORC1MBG3.html">A2FEJIORC1MBG3</a><br/><p>Wackjob screenwriter Charlie Kaufman ("Being John Malkovich", "Adaptation") strikes again, with (the usual) mixed results. The largely polarized "loved it-hated it" reviews posted here prove once again that you either buy into Kaufman's somewhat myopic Woody Allen-on-crack worldview, or you don't. I will admit to being a bit of a fence-sitter in regards to Mr. Kaufman's work-I can appreciate his creativity and where he is coming from, but his films sometimes give me the uncomfortably creepy feeling that I am reading someone's private dream journal that was never intended for my prying eyes. Tom Wilkinson ("Full Monty", "In The Bedroom") keeps a straight face as the doctor-scientist running Lacuna, Inc., a clinic specializing in "erasing" unpleasant memories (love affairs and other mental traumas) from client's minds, sort of a "Total Recall" in reverse. Jim Carrey plays a lovelorn depressive who decides to go through the process after learning that his ex (a complete kook played by a decidedly unglamorous Kate Winslet) has had him erased from her memory. This silly, faux-sci-fi concept works mostly due to the earnest (albeit weird) performances from the cast. As unconventional as Kaufman's approach is, the movie surrenders to a somewhat predictable denoument that makes you feel like you've been led around the theater by your nose. Jim Carrey suffers a bit here from the Bill Murray Syndrome (wherein comic actors "play dead" when cast in a Serious Role-"Don't laugh at me-I'm ACTING!"). Worth a look for fans of the offbeat.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>The only positive thing I can say about this movie was, that it was different than most.

MIERZWIAK says "TECHNICALLY SPEAKING - IT IS BRAIN DAMAGE" - BUT ITS A SUPERB DRAMA<br /><br />Jim Carrey does very well in this highly unusual drama. If you are considering purchasing this DVD, go with the 2-disk "Special Edition".<br /><br />MY IMPRESSIONS OF THE FILM:<br /><br />The chronology of this film is unconventionally ordered, but it is not just for the sake of being different. I got this DVD for my 16-year-old daughter to watch as she is a big Jim Carrey fan, but I found the movie to be more compelling for me than I expected. Jim Carrey's role was serious and he was superb. The supporting cast, a rather eclectic ensemble were perfect for the role, especially Kate Winslet as Carrey's very weird significant other [Clementine] and Tom Wilkinson as the mad scientist/doctor who appears as staid and perfectly mainstream as everyone's family doctor or dentist. Wilkinson's mundane delivery of really profound statements is shockingly powerful. One instance has Carrey [Joel Barish] asking Wilkinson [Dr.Mierzwiak] if the procedure could cause brain damage to which the good doctor replied blandly, "Technically speaking, it is brain damage, but nothing you will miss; like a night of heavy drinking." The result of all this is a huge and unexpected emotional connection and investment in the characters based completely on a ridiculous premise.<br /><br />So well done is the character driven theme of this movie that I found myself believing that all this was possible while simultaneously wrenching over the pain Joel and Clementine were going through as a result of this relentlessly-irreversible procedure.<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD:<br /><br />The transfer is great, as expected being a mega-budget new release. As far as the features go, I expected much more due to the really intriguing nature of the film. We'll have to settle for a pretend TV commercial featuring Dr. Mierzwiak and his new memory-erasing procedure, a small featurette, and a few deleted scenes. In the new "2-disk Special Edition" we can see some additional cool features but for those of us who already bought the first widescreen or fullscreen DVD release it is a bummer.<br /><br />If you are considering the purchase of this film, go with the 2-Disk "Special Edition" because you'll get DTS stereo audio as well as the additional special features in the bargain.<br /><br />OVERALL:THIS FILM DESERVES REPEATED VIEWINGS<br /><br />My daughter and I have watched this film at least 10 times and we have yet to tire of it. We both feel it is Carrey at his best in a new and very effective role. It is a film that one understands and enjoys more the second time. See what you think!</p></br><a href="../users/A1R9GZ8FC44MF5.html">A1R9GZ8FC44MF5</a><br/><p>for being creative and original, but the rest of the movie is just not worthy of being made into a movie.  Its has no theme, no deep meaning, it doesnt say its better to have loved and lose then never loved at all, it says what if? you loved and losed what if? you had your memories erased to make yourself feel better How would you feel after that?, but it never answers those questioned.  The performances are ok, the story is creative and original, but all thats wasted on pointless unaffectionate love crap that means didly.  If you like chick flicks and want to see something original not, i love you, but you love him, and he loves her and blah blah blah, then this is for you.  I just think they should have tapped the people more, and not an emotion that they are striving for, i cant feel for love, i can feel for people who love and loose it, but an emotion exists to someone and in a movie their emotions dont just spill into the viewer so we have to relate to the characters.  3 out of a 10 for an original view, but its wasted on meaninglessness.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>And you can guess this isn't one of them.<br /><br />You know what this movie's about?  "Wouldn't it be cool if we could erase our memories?  Wouldn't that be cool?"  No.  Characters, plot, actors with a lick of talent, and dialogue that doesn't just lay there would be cool.  So would some good writing, which is notable for its total absence here.<br /><br />I did watch it all, by the way.  The girl's recording of why she was dumping Jim Carrey was good writing.  Nothing else was.<br /><br />When Jim Carrey was running around in his old memories with the metaphor for his memories of what's-her-face, did anyone have a TRON flashback?<br /><br />Really, we take one little premise and waffle and wander all over the place for over 100 minutes that seem a whole lot longer than that.<br /><br />And really, if we had mind-wiping technology, is that what we'd do with it?  Settle a spat with a guy/girl or forget a dead doggie?  If my cat left me for some other guy with a tin of tuna, I'd certainly want to remember her.<br /><br />But all that's irrelevant.  Really it's just bad, lazy, sloppy writing.</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>I would honestly give this negative five stars if I could.  It had the promise of a great story line, but I don't feel that it did anywhere near where it could have.  Neither did the rest of the audience in the theatre.  Half of them had left before the first half of the movie was done.  It was crappy (sorry Jim - I do normally love you).  Maybe I'm not artsey fartsey enough but I just didn't get this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AUECYM0M0YSX.html">A3AUECYM0M0YSX</a><br/><p>This movie turned out to be a half-full, half-empty glass of water. I saw it half-full. My wife saw it half-empty. For once, she was the pessimist. (Write this date down!)<br /><br />To me it raised the interesting question of, if you know ahead of time how disappointing something is going to turn out, is it still worth going through anyway? Few things meet our expectations; the concept always outshines the actuality. But when you fall in love everything seems like it's going to be peachy for the rest of eternity. Disappointment almost always looms. It's how you deal with it that counts.<br /><br />Because even in the best relationship, you're going to get bored with each other. You're going to start to find small niggling faults becoming reasons for a major fallout. Most breakups aren't over big, dramatic actions ("You slept with my sister while you said you were on a business trip in Seattle!") but rather small things that start to irritate you about the other person--the weird color they dye their hair, or how they say "liberry" instead of "library."<br /><br />This is what happens to both Jim Carey and Kate Winslet in this movie. And both of them, to forget each other, have their memories of the other person flushed out. But to paraphrase Tennyson, is it better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all? That's the difficult question the movie grapples with, and the astonishing thing about it is that you never feel like it's "grappling" with it at all. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman knows how to deal with some uncommon themes (particularly in Hollywood, where any film in which the female lead doesn't take her top off or get hung upside-down on a meat hook is considered practically an art film these days) very naturally. Carey gradually discovers that even bad feelings have their upside, their purpose, because without them the good have no context. They're inseparable, and when the "bad" ones have to go so must the good. Too late he realizes this is not what he wants. Then a series of complications almost too twisted to chart ensue. Kaufman must have had a roadmap tacked to his wall to keep it all straight. The astonishing thing--and the tribute to his screenwriting prowess--is that we the viewers can keep them straight too. Despite a story that's almost impossible to re-tell, Eternal Sunshine is actually a very easy movie to watch, never confusing, never too fast or too slow. This is no small achievement.<br /><br />So that's my take on things. My wife's view is that the film was trying to say that no matter how many chances you get, you still make the same stupid mistakes. She cites as evidence the moment in the doctor's office where the receptionist tells a patient she can't have the procedure three times in one month. She cites as evidence the fact that although a key character (not Winslet) has her memory wiped clean, she turns around and does the same foolish thing with another person when the same opportunity presents itself. All true, but I think that's more of a subplot than *the* plot. The minor characters may fumble about, but our heroes Kate and Jim will learn something in the end from their stumbles, and they do, at an empty beach house, that has to be one of the saddest, most underwritten (in a good way), farewell scene I've watched in years (decades?). Kaufman and the producers trusted their audience. They didn't feel they needed to get out the pile driver. It's beautiful writing. I wish there were more intelligence like this in Hollywood these days.<br /><br />As some others have noted, this is first and foremost a director and writer's picture. It's not the acting that carries things along. Still, the right casting is important, for we really have to relate to these characters quickly, since we don't get a lot of exposition before things go nonlinear. In Jim Carney we have the perfect "everyman." I never care for Carey when he's manic or crazy, but beneath the "over-the-top" persona there beats the warm heart of a genuine artist. Brit Kate Winslet astonishes at how effortlessly she plays a very American, very ordinary character--every semi-big town is full of "individualists" like Clementine, with her ever-changing hair, Doc Marten boots, and terminal retail career outlook. ("I'm just a f---ed up girl looking for her own piece of mind!") Both characters have the tough and thankless job of appearing unremarkable while making us care about them very much. Kirsten Dunst plays the Cameron Diaz role--a nice but ditzy blonde who spends a lot of time dancing around in her underwear. Elijah Wood and Mark Ruffalo look like they should have the Verizon wireless Network behind them. (How the sophisticated job of memory erasure is done with a couple of laptops and some simple software is hilarious.) And Tom Wilkinson is effortless, as usual, in the supporting role of the doctor who runs the clinic that vacuums minds the way those cheap professional maid services vacuum carpets. (You never quite trust them in your house. Are they going to break your porcelain knick-knacks? Raid your fridge and drink your beer?)<br /><br />But mostly it's the ideas--and the way they're executed--that makes Eternal Sunshine so memorable. Extras include lots of interviews with Carey and director Michel Gondry, Winslet and Gondry (where things start out a little testy, and no, I don't think they were kidding), a making-of featurette that includes the scoop on how they did the remarkable special effects (not how you'd think in this digital day and age), and lots of other goodies we've come to expect from hit movies. Transfer to DVD is excellent. This is one of the more intelligent films to come out in recent years. Here's looking forward to the next Charlie Kaufman project.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Michael Gondry<br /><br />Cast:  Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Gerry Robert Byrne, Elijah Wood, Thomas Jay Ryan, Mark Ruffalo, Jane Adams, David Cross, Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson.<br /><br />Running Time:  108 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for for language, some drug and sexual content.<br /><br />One of the most unique and heartwarming films of the year, "The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is remarkable in its delivery and supreme in its scope.  Joel (Jim Carrey) is socially inept. He has had girlfriends, but none that really meant anything. It is as if he has never had a significant relationship of any kind. But, one day, he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet).  She is wild and kooky, changing her hair color from red to orange to blue to green depending on her current mood. She seems the polar opposite of Joel, but they click in ways even they can't pinpoint, but from the moment they meet, they know there is something special there.  However, after a silly argument breaks up their relationship, Clementine decides to visit Lacuna Inc., a company that specializes in wiping troubling memories away forever. She has decided to erase the memory of Joel. When Joel hears this from some friends, he angrily decides to do the same to Clementine, erasing her completely from his mind.<br /><br />The erasing process involves a mapping of the memories and an all night process of erasure that is "technically brain damage", according to the doctor. The bulk of the film takes place during the process, inside Joel's mind. The most recent memories are first to go and we watch as they slowly disappear into nothingness. Those recent memories are bitter as we witness the arguments and the boredom of their relationship. But as the time rewinds, the memories get better. We travel backwards and watch Joel and Clem during their best moments, loving life and loving each other. As this happens, Joel desperately regrets his decision, wanting the inevitable erasure to stop, but he is completely powerless. Soon she will be gone and he won't even remember that he forgot her. The film focuses on his attempts to foil the process and retain some of her in the recesses of his mind.<br /><br />"Eternal Sunshine" is directed by Michel Gondry who also helmed "Human Nature". He has a flare that accompanies Kaufman's words with perfect symmetry. This film bounces around on its timeline almost hysterically, but the director never lets us get lost. We always feel in control of our senses and our emotions. It is a tribute to Carrey and Winslet that they were able to do the same.  Jim Carrey has pulled off a rather remarkable transformation that I would have deemed impossible a decade ago. He is becoming a brilliant actor with qualities that resemble Jimmy Stewart and Tom Hanks. He is a fabulous everyman who is sympathetic and knowing, interesting and kind. He deserves tremendous praise for this role. Kate Winslet is consistently brilliant in every film. She is easily one of the very best actresses we have. Here she plays against type, and embodies a fascinating woman who craves attention but needs intimacy. Hers is a beautiful performance that will go overlooked. It is easy to understand why Joel falls in love with Clementine.  There is a very deep message in "Sunshine," and it is arguably screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's ("Adaptation") deepest film to date. Love and romance and memories of both have rarely been examined as thought-provokingly and tenderly as they are in this wonderful motion picture. The movie has a very profound message that all viewers should pay attention to. There are many small intricacies in the film, surely picked up on more thoroughly on repeat viewings, and the entire construction of the movie is completely enthralling and intelligent.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is a beautiful movie, eloquently voiced by Gondry, firmly constructed and rooted in an eerie nightmarish fantasy land where anything is possible. It's beautiful, it's bizarre, it's exceptional, it's funny, it's lovely, it's touching, it's witty, and it's one of the best movies of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/ADE852UR9121C.html">ADE852UR9121C</a><br/><p>Few movies engage the mind and touch the soul like this one. It is based on a simple premise but it is told in such a way that leaves me in awe everytime I watch it.<br /><br />Joel is an all-round nice guy who lives a very normal and quiet life. He meets Clementine and they hit it off. Clementine shows Joel the wild side of things. She makes things exciting. They're in love. But it's not long before each finds the other annoying. They feel suffocated in the relationship, and they want out. Clementine goes to a clinic and gets her memories removed. Joel, who finds out about this decides to do the same and we are shown glimpses of memories that is being erased while Joel is, in fact unconcious in his living room.<br /><br />If I was unclear about the story, I'm sorry...but this is a movie that you have too see to truly understand. What grabbed me most about this movie was the screenplay and the acting. The story is something we all can relate to...I mean, who hasn't been so in love only to find that it's not working out and soon, you wish that you never met that person. Based on this, Charlie Kaufman has conjured a magnificent story about these two people, as different as light and day, who end up being happy with each another. The love between the characters are described in specific memories, and moments rather than words...and that's the true beauty of this movie. Because of this, it does not end up being like every other romantic movie out there. This movie also questions the viewer, if given a chance...would you really give up the memories of a past love? Would it make you happier? If that love is strong enough, could it bring the two of you back together? These are some of the questions that I pondered upon watching this movie. Charlie Kaufman deservedly won an Oscar for this screenplay.<br /><br />The acting was also superb. Jim Carrey gives one of his best performances here. I was mesmerized by what he brought to his character. Kate Winslet also shines in her role as Clementine. Their acting made the love between their characters seem so real and honest. They strengthen Kaufman's script so well that the whole movie seems natural. The supporting actors are no less impressive. The whole cast brings a certain authenticity to the movie.<br /><br />To be honest, I have not watched a movie as good as this for a long time. It gives a breath of fresh air towards a dying genre of movies in Hollywood, and that is romance. Intelligent, creative and original are some of the words I would choose to describe this movie. You can do no wrong with getting "Eternal Sunshine...". Trust me.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>The brilliant, creative mind of writer Charlie Kaufman and the able direction of Michel Gondry guided an all star cast in a totally unique type of romantic dramatic comedy.<br /><br />Jim Carey, again proves his versatility in portraying Joel Barish, a shy introverted guy who falls for a flaky extroverted gal Clementine who he meets on the beach in Montauk.  Kate Winslet does a terrific job playing the often times out of control wacko Clementine, who appears to be the diametric opposite of Barish.<br /><br />The fun starts when Winslet, tiring of their rocky relationship undergoes an experimental procedure to totally erase Carey from her memory.  Carey freaks out and in spite also seeks out Dr. Mierzwiak, the inventor of this technology, well played by veteran actor Tom Wilkinson.  He desires to have Winslet also purged from his memory.  During the procedure, Carey gets second thoughts and while bit by bit of his memory is being erased, he starts changing his mind about doing it.  Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst and Mark Ruffalo are hysterical as Dr. M's technical associates. While reliving memories about to be expunged, Carey decides that he deeply cares for Winslet.<br /><br />"Eternal Sunshine" was an exhilirating movie experience.  I particularly enjoy the effect of having Carey's character come out from behind the camera to observe the plot of the movie within the movie.  This appears to be a staple of Kaufman plots as in his also fabulous flick "Adaptation"</p></br><a href="../users/A29COAL60SB48B.html">A29COAL60SB48B</a><br/><p>There are almost 600 reviews to date of this movie so the plot has been reviewed to death.  I was pleasantly shocked to see this movie get such rave reviews from so many people and that was a major factor in deciding to watch this film and I am not disappointed in the least.<br /><br />The casual observer would never think that Jim Carrey (known for his comedic skills) would be able to pull off a dramatic role but he did it (and then some) with "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."  I like the way he whispered throughout the film when a memory with Clementine came up.  It added depth to what was about to happen ("This was the last time I saw you").<br /><br />I've always had great respect for Kate Winslet (I feel she was slighted for never receiving an Oscar for her role in "Titanic" and she was superb in "Quills") but watching this just made me respect her a little bit more.  She played flaky but introspective Clementine convincingly, drawing you into her character.<br /><br />The supporting cast was just as good.  I didn't think I'd be impressed with Kirsten Dunst but boy was I wrong.  I thought she was going to play an empty role and leave after a few scenes (scene candy) but what a twist the ending turned out to be (watch it to find out).  Mark Ruffalo was cute in his role as the assistant to the scientist behind the memory cleansing technique and who could have guessed the turn Patrick (Elijah Wood) would take?<br /><br />This is quite the proverbial cut above the rest.  I feel the way the film was edited added to the depth of the storyline.  The film's format was far from conventional (having the opening credits roll 18 minutes into the movie underscored that) - there was no spelling out of the plot nor was it too obvious, the twists at the end, for me, were a pleasant surprise (not a shocker that left you wondering "Where did *that* come from?") and the way the scenery would collapse as Joel's memories were erased was outstanding as well as the way he would convey his current feelings in the context of past events ("By morning you'll be gone.  The perfect ending to this piece of s*** story!").<br /><br />There is only one word to describe "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind": BRILLIANT!  Do yourself the favor and watch this movie without any interruptions.  - Donna Di Giacomo</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of the weirdest movies that I've ever seen. It's also one of the most moving. The basic plot of the movie is this: A shy Joel (Carrey) meets the outgoing Clementine (Winslet), and the two fall in love. After a horrible fight/break up, Clementine undergoes a procedure that erases Joel from her memory. In the heat of anger, Joel himself signs up for a similar procedure. However, mid-way through the erasure, he changes his mind. The viewer is granted an opportunity to inhabit Joel's mind as he tries to hold on to the final shreds of his love with Clementine.<br /><br />The movie interestingly explores themes relating to love. When you really love someone, and the realtionship ends badly, you ARE tempted to wish the whole mess had never happened. This movie shows us what a tragedy it would be if our wishes were granted.<br /><br />I thought Jim Carrey did a fabulous job in this film; I don't think I've seen him turn in such a layered performance in anything else he's ever done. It's just such an original concept - the thought that you could erase people, places, things, from your memory. But if you erase things that bring you pain, you also erase some of the joy out of your life. And you erase part of who you are. If you erase your mistakes, you don't learn from them. And you don't grow stronger because of them.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>From the mind of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a stunningly original film that features possibly career best performances from Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet as doomed couple Joel and Clementine.  When Joel learns that Clementine that undergone a proceedure to erase her memories of him, Joel strikes back by undertaking the same treatment.  However, as the proceedure gets underway, Joel realizes that throughout their tumultuous relationship, he has and will always love her, and he fights to save his memories.  As you can tell by the plot synopsis and previous reviews, Eternal Sunshine is not a film for everyone and it's not something that is instantly likeable.  What Eternal Sunshine is however, is a brilliant and original love story for a new age, excellently handled by visionary director Michel Gondry.  The rest of the cast, including Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson, and David Cross, do great work.  There should be more films like this; Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a surprising emotional tour de force that bombards all your senses at once, and once you take it all in the first time, you'll be longing for another trip.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BEU7GPGNIG44.html">A2BEU7GPGNIG44</a><br/><p>It's not often that I find films were I think that the writing and the directing and the acting are all in sync, but "Eternal Sunshing Of The Spotless Mind" is one of those films.  Although confusing at times, it is a thought provoking film, I'm sure that people at times have wanted to erase people or events from their minds.  One thing my husband pointed out about the relationship between Kate Winslet's character and Jim Carrey's character is although they argued  and fussed at times it was a somewhat accurate portrayel of a couple, although they have their ups and downs at the end of the day they really loved each other.  The time line of the film screwed with my head and I felt confused at times but in the end I think I got it. The concept of the film transferred onto the finished project quite well.</p></br></body></html>

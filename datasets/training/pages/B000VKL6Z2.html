For one thing, I don't want to compare it to the original Halloween, since the original is supposed to be a classic and therefore, untouchable.<br /><br />Something was wrong with the pacing in this remade version though.<br /><br />The movie started off SO good when it was dealing with the little kid going crazy and killing everyone in sight.  He was being picked on at school by a bully, a stepfather that treated him poorly, and a sister he didn't like.  The only person the little boy liked was his mother.<br /><br />There was a disturbing aspect to the storyline in that watching the little boy kill people in graphic ways time and time again, you begin to realize for the boy there's no compassion for human life whatsoever.  A disturbing side of the horror genre when it deals with realistic and dangerous subjects such as that.<br /><br />They even touched upon the subject of whether the little boy actually felt anything when he was doing the killing.  Apparently not.<br /><br />This movie must have some kind of record for the most killings in a movie, haha.  Time and time again people would get slaughtered, smashed, stabbed, you name it, but the same unstoppable insane lunatic roaming the streets and suburbs.<br /><br />The main problem with the movie was how it started off so darn good and gradually got worse and worse until eventually you knew what was going to happen at the very end.  To me this is inexcusable for a movie that should have kept a consistent momentum that it had for the first hour or so.  Seriously, the first hour of the movie was pure horror perfection.  It just failed to keep the same exciting pace for the last 40 minutes or so because the final segments of the film were so predictable.<br /><br />The subject of the killer trying to find his sister had potential, but never delivered.  What was he planning to do with his baby sister once he found her?  Also, why did he kill that guy who was supposed to be his friend back at the psychiatric hospital?  The killer had no sympathy for someone that honestly cared about him for several years, you think he would have given the guy a break.<br /><br />But the most important thing is that the movie turned into a rather ordinary slasher horror by the second half of the movie, failing to come through.  I'll be generous and give the movie 4 stars anyway because I really did enjoy the first half of the movie with all the creative and constant killing action.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>When I went to see Rob Zombie's remake of John Carpenter's immortal classic called "Halloween", I went into the theater with an open mind. The feeling that I got after leaving the cinema was that Zombie's remake of "Halloween" would have been a decent horror movie in its own right if it had not been named "Halloween" and if it had not attempted to remake the original classic. After having seen the director's cut as well as the theatrical version, I can say that as a horror movie in and of itself, the "Halloween" remake is not bad and is actually a brutal and violent slasher film that is capable of producing some horror.<br /><br />With that being said, you have to come up with something more than what you get in this movie if you want to try and do a remake of one of the greatest horror movies of all-time in the original "Halloween" and call yourself, a success or an effective remake. Otherwise, you open yourself up to a tremendous amount of criticism, and you are going to get hammered. First, the acting in the remake was clearly inferior in every conceivable way compared to the original, most glaring was the inept performance of the actor who played Dr. Loomis in this remake. I thought he was just AWFUL, not just compared to the brilliant Donald Pleasance, but just AWFUL. In fact, the acting in general caused me to be unsympathetic to the characters. There really aren't any likeable characters in this movie when you think about it, unlike the original "Halloween" in which how could one not like Dr. Loomis and Laurie Strode? These type of characters are completely missing in the remake, and that is only one reason why the remake is inferior to the original "Halloween". Also, does every single one of Rob Zombie's characters have to be white trash? I am not just talking about this remake either...I am talking about all of his movies. It must some kind of neurotic obsession of Mr. Zombie's I guess.<br /><br />The next point that should be made is the degenerative family that Zombie uses to attempt to explain why Michael Myers goes mentally insane. I think Zombie should be commended (and I have been very critical of his films-claiming he should stick to music) for trying to change things up, but he tries to explain too much of the darkness in Michael Myers and that takes away from the mystery and horror of the "Boogeyman" factor if you will. In other words, I believe that Michael Myers is a lot scarier in the original because we do not know why he went off the way he did and killed his sister whereas the remake attempts to portray Michael Myers as a victim of a degenerative family.<br /><br />By the same token, Zombie focuses a lot more on the childhood of Michael Myers in an attempt to differentiate his remake from the classic. From that standpoint, I admire Zombie's effort and creativity, but I just do not believe that the remake is anywhere near as effective as the original as a horror movie. Sure, there's plenty more violence in the remake, but does that necessarily mean that it is scarier? I would argue that it does not. Perhaps the most glaring flaw in Zombie's remake is the failure to match or even attempt to match the atmosphere that is so ever-present in the original. In my opinion, Zombie is unable to present the Halloween theme anywhere near as well as Carpenter, and that is an understatement. Indeed, Zombie's focus is clearly on Myers whereas Carpenter's focus was on Myers as the "Boogeyman" and Halloween itself. Zombie completely fails to capture the Halloween theme...PERIOD. We just do not have this in the remake, and that is the main reason why I believe that the remake would have been received better had it not been a remake of the immortal classic. In other words, if Zombie had attempted to fashion this movie as a modern slasher instead of trying to create a remake of "Halloween" out of it, this movie would have been more effective, more accepted, and more of a success. Oh, sure, the remake was a tremendous financial success, but, hell, anyone could have made a movie and called it a remake of John Carpenter's masterpiece, "Halloween", and gotten millions of dollars just off of the name of the flick, so the amount of money this remake brought in does not tell us anything.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, the remake of "Halloween" is dripping with this generation's lifestyle with a focus on these gothic and long-haired type of people, not to mention Zombie's unquestioned preference for white trash characters. Zombie tries to be hardcore with his remake, and that is fine. In fact, I did not see one normal looking person in the entire movie...no offense, but did anyone notice how all of the men had long hair like 80s rock stars in this movie? I am not just talking about Michael Myers either...I am talking about Dr. Loomis. Clearly, this was an attempt by Zombie to cater to this generation's 20-something year olds. As a result, I fear that many people who were too young to grow up with the original "Halloween" will probably like the remake better because they can unfortunately relate to these types of characters as being part and parcel of this generation. Oh well, to each his own.<br /><br />At any rate, I give Zombie credit for at least trying to be creative and imaginative with the remake to some extent and not copying it word for word (although he did do some copying for sure) like the remake of "Psycho". That said, the "Halloween" remake would have been better if it had not tried to be "Halloween", but rather if it had attempted to be a modern slasher with a different name basing itself on its own individual charm because this movie could have done that. Sure, some changes would have had to been made, but it could have survived on its own merit without being a remake of "Halloween". However, the fact of the matter is that this is an inferior remake of one of if not the greatest horror movie of all-time, and I cannot assign it more than two (2) stars because it is simply categorically inferior to John Carpenter's original classic masterpiece in every conceivable way.<br /><br />In conclusion, the remake is different enough to stand on its own, but it lacks the spirit of the original classic, and it is simply no where near as good or as scary as the original. However, this is par for the course for these Hollywood remakes of the classics. I am wondering what is next?<br />As a matter of fact, it should be noted that the only remake, in my opinion, that has measured up to the original would be the remake of "Cape Fear" by Martin Scorcese. Why was that successful and effective? Surprise!! It had great acting, great execution and a great director! There is a hint Hollywood if you want to remake classic movies, but what difference does it make? I mean, hell, Rob Zombie is laughing all the way to the bank.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UA046AA3DXFD.html">A3UA046AA3DXFD</a><br/><p>This week we, Sid the Elf, decided to review the remake or whatever of the greatest horror film ever, Halloween. Now, we knew that this film was done by the ever-creepy Rob Zombie so we realized going in that things had a chance to get wierd or stupid but this one was ridiculous. It was a remake of the classic, kind of but not really. And the parts that were the same as the original were different here. Sounds confusing? Well how about watching this in an altered state trying to figure it out?<br /><br />The bulk of the film concentrated on Michael Myers's early life and his rise to the top of the world of serial killing. The funniest parts of this movie came in the section where the evil stepdad was making fun of a young Myers calling him a freak and questioning his sexuality while Myers stands there taking it while wearing a homemade mask. It doesn't get much funnier than that. You also had young Myers making the "I want to wrestle you so freaking bad" face whenever anyone made him mad. Well, when he wasn't wearing one of his little masks. That was great. Also, young Myers offered us a couple of freakouts. The one when he went off on Loomis was awesome. If this movie was not a remake of a classic, and stood on its own, it would have made a pretty good horror B as all the elements were there. However, when you look at this film as the remake that it was, it fell way short.<br /><br />First, Sid would like to talk to you about Loomis. In the original, he was the best part about the film. Who could forget such classic lines as, "Tell your men to keep their eyes open and their mouths closed," along with many others. In the remake Loomis offered nothing, he had the blackest eyes, the devil's eyes. He even exploited Myers's psycosis by writing a book and going on a speaking tour over it. Then, there was Laurie. In the first film, she was sweet and innocent and you really did not want Myers to catch her. This was one of the things that made the original. In the new version, she was trashy and annoying. Sid was hoping they would change the ending and have Myers strangle her by the 30 minute mark. Finally, there was Myers. In this one, he was a giant goon, which does explain his freakish strength and adds a lot in the way of unintentional comedy. But, he was so goofy. Sid even joked that Kane was playing him, only to find out that it was actually a more b wrestler that we'd never even heard of! Big Sky is the guy's name for the record.<br /><br />So, this film was ok at best. That's factoring in all the unintentional comedy by goofy Myers, young Myers, and the stepdad; and the um, comedic mood Sid was in. Apperances by Clint Howard and Danny Trejo helped ease the pain a little. Oh, and the few times the film featured "Don't Fear the Reaper" was a pretty cool nod to the original and to more cowbell. But, Zombie's version concentrated too much on the gore of Myers' killings and his disturbed past really trying to drive home the fact that this man is totally insane. Yeah, we kind of got that by the huge killing spree, but I guess when you're Rob Zombie that's not really enough to classify someone as off the reservation. This one is probably only worth checking out if you've never seen the original and want to settle in with a decent horror B or if you just want to make fun of fat young Myers for a little bit. All in all 3 stars, not great, not bad. It insists upon itself, I like The Money Pit.</p></br><a href="../users/A29TKSIWA3JKF3.html">A29TKSIWA3JKF3</a><br/><p>I don't know what I was expecting but this wasn't it.<br /><br />Turgid is the best way to describe this mess.  Sad and boring is another way of looking at it.  The prolog went on forever, reveling in and glorifying domestic abuse.  The argument being, I suppose, that all this RAGE on the home front and in school is what made Michael Myers become an unholy monster.  If that doesn't demystify Carpenter's creation, everything that follows does.  Zombie has managed to do the unthinkable; he's turned an icon of horror into a sniveling creature of banality.  Then he populated his film with strange casting choices that came off as crazy inside jokes: Udo Kier and Clint Howard!<br /><br />A pointless exercise in mismanagement, never mind any real filmmaking skills.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>When I went to see Rob Zombie's remake of John Carpenter's immortal classic called "Halloween", I went into the theater with an open mind.

Therefore, Carpenter's Myers is flat out scarier than Zombie's Myers and, no, it is not even close.

From that standpoint, I somewhat admire Zombie's effort and creativity, but I just do not believe that the remake is anywhere near as effective as the original as a horror movie.

However, perhaps the most glaring flaw in Zombie's remake is the failure to match or even attempt to match the style, suspense and atmosphere that is so ever-present in Carpenter's original classic.  Consequently, there really is no comparison between the two because the original classic is a very scary movie whereas the remake is not.  Another very interesting difference between the two movies that should be discussed is that Zombie's focus is clearly on Myers, the person, whereas Carpenter's focus was on Myers as the "Boogeyman" and the evil night of Halloween itself.  Zombie completely fails to capture the Halloween theme here...PERIOD.  Unfortunately, we just do not have this in the remake, and that is the main reason why I believe that the remake would have been received better had it not been a remake of the immortal classic.

Actually, I feel compelled to mention that when strictly compared to the original John Carpenter's "Halloween", this movie would get an utter ZERO and John Carpenter's version gets every bit of FIVE STARS and then some.  However, I am grading this movie on its own merit and not just as a comparison...thus, the TWO STARS for a somewhat entertaining slasher.<br /><br />In conclusion, the remake is different enough to stand on its own, but it lacks the spirit of the original classic, and it is simply no where near as good or as scary as the original.

Don't hate me, but the Rob Zombie remake of "Halloween" could quite possibly be better than the John Carpenter directed original. I love the first "Halloween" (I even caught it at a movie theatre where they played it the night before Halloween and the day of) and I love Rob Zombie's previous two movies. "House of 1000 Corpses" wasn't very good, but I enjoyed it...And "The Devil's Rejects" was one of the best horror films I've ever seen. Zombie's re-imagining of "Halloween" sticks close enough to the original store to not upset horror buffs, but puts his own stamp on it at the same time. One thing the film does is delve a bit deeper into the childhood of Michael Myers. The movie opens on Halloween, where we meet the family. Michael's mother (Sheri Moon) is a stripper with an abusive, drunken, crippled boyfriend. He has a baby sister and an older sister and, besides wearing masks constantly appears fairly normal. Well, for two seconds...Until we watch him slaughter his pet rat. Pretty soon, Michael has killed a schoolyard bully and, while his mother is at work, he kills the boyfriend, his sister, and her boyfriend...Leaving only the baby alive. Sent to a mental asylum, Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell, who is nice to see in a nice-guy role) is assigned to treat Michael. Pretty soon though, Michael has killed a nurse at the asylum and has withdrawn into his mind...And not long after, his mother commits suicide. 15 years later; Michael escapes from the asylum and decides to try and find his sister. Most of the things that happen after his escape will seem quite familar to watchers of the original film. Zombie did a really great job with this movie. Learning about the Myers character was very interesting and creepy. His casting of McDowell (whom he no doubt cast over his love for "A Clockwork Orange") was great, as well as casting Brad Dourif (voice of Chucky) as a cop. The aging of the characters is very well done. When we meet Loomis in the beginning, he looks like a fairly younger guy. 15 years later; Loomis looks like...Well, Malcolm McDowell. "Halloween" has it's share of originality on top of the things that were necessary for the remake (i.e., the music). But this is easily the best remake I've seen of a horror film in a good long while. Rob Zombie is a very gifted writer/director (I'm starting to like his movies better than I ever liked his music) and I hope he continues, because this movie already shows that Zombie has created a signature style (listen to the dialogue between Michael's mother and her boyfriend in the beginning of the film). Anyway, as it is a horror film...It's no masterpiece. And it has its share of nudity and violence, but overall...It's a work of art.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/AE42JLYPXUI45.html">AE42JLYPXUI45</a><br/><p>When I first heard about Rob Zombie writing and directing the remake to John Carpenter's HALL0WEEN, I immediately knew that the film was gonna be incredible. I am a major fan of Michael Myers and the entire HALLOWEEN series, so you ought to believe how excited I was to see this film when Rob Zombie had finished it. Little did I know that this remake was even more incredible than I had anticipated. I was expecting a great remake, and what I saw was not great; it was fu*BEEP*ing outstanding. Rob Zombie went into a completely different direction with his remake, a direction so different that this remake does the original film so much more justice.<br /><br />The film starts on Halloween, introducing MICHAEL MYERS (played by Daeg Faerch) , a troubled ten year old boy. In his room, Michael admires Elvis, a pet rat, while wearing a clown mask. Downstairs, his mother DEBORAH MYERS (played by Sherri Moon Zombie, Rob Zombie's sexy wife) argues with her crippled boyfriend RONNIE WHITE (played by William Forsythe) and Michael's sister JUDITH MYERS (played by Hannah R. Hall). Michael, in the bathroom washing a small bloody knife, is called downstairs by Judith. Ronnie berates him, teasing him for wearing masks all the time. Later at school, Michael is confronted by WESLEY RHODES (played by Daryl Sabara), a bully, and his friend. Wesley teases Michael, threatening to make copies of a newspaper advertisement for The Rabbit in Red, a strip club where Michael's mother works. A fight ensues and Deborah is called into the school to speak with DR. SAMUEL J. LOOMIS (played by Malcolm McDowell), a child psychologist. Loomis wants to evaluate Michael, after the school found a dead cat and numerous photographs of dead animals in Michael's backpack. Michael, overhearing the conversation, leaves the office and follows Wesley Rhodes into the woods. Donning his clown mask, Michael brutally beats the bully with a sturdy tree branch. While Wesley begs for mercy, Michael finds the advertisement in his coat pocket. He takes it before murdering Rhodes.<br /><br />At home, Ronnie and Michael are watching a movie on television as Deborah is about to leave for work. Before leaving, she tells Michael that every thing will be better soon. She leaves, and Judith is left to take Michael trick-or-treating. However, Judith's boyfriend STEVE shows up, canceling Michael's trick-or-treat plans. Ronnie falls asleep on the couch, leaving Steve and Judith to have sex in her room. Michael, again donning his clown mask, proceeds to duct tape Ronnie to the couch, where Michael then violently slits Ronnie's throat. Upstairs, Steve and Judith finish having sex, and he puts on the infamous William Shatner mask, wanting to have sex with the mask on. Judith refuses, and Steve goes downstairs to make some food. While in the kitchen, Michael sneaks up on Steve and bludgeons him with an aluminum baseball bat. With Judith asleep upstairs, Michael finds and puts on the white mask. He enters Judith's room, and places his hand on her leg. Mistaking him for Steve, Judith turns and questions the silent Michael, slapping him. He then stabs her in the stomach with a kitchen knife. As she stumbles through the halls of the house, Michael follows, stabbing her a total of seventeen times. He then enters the baby's room and takes her out to the porch. Deborah returns home from work, finding Michael and the baby on the porch. The police arrive, and Michael is taken into custody.<br /><br />Eleven months later, Michael is committed to Smith's Grove Sanitarium under the care of Dr. Loomis. In recorded therapy sessions with Loomis, Michael claims to not remember anything about killing. As Deborah has weekly visitation rights, Michael now creates and wears masks at all times. By Christmas, Loomis and Michael are screaming at each other. Eventually, Michael stops talking. During a visit, Deborah gives Michael a picture of him holding his baby sister. Moments later, as Loomis is about to walk Deborah to her car, Michael stabs an overseeing nurse in the throat with a fork. At the Myers home, Deborah is watching old home movies of Michael, crying. She then proceeds to commit suicide by shooting herself in the head.<br /><br />Fifteen years later, Loomis tells a 27-year-old MICHAEL MYERS (played by Tyler Mane), who hasn't said a word in 15 years, that he is no longer going to be his psychologist. That same night, Smith's Grove plans on transferring Michael to a maximum security prison. Before the asylum police can transfer him, Michael kills them, and eventually the majority of the Smith's Grove staff. He escapes, and runs into a truck driver named Big Joe Grizzley. Michael confronts him in the bathroom, and kills him, stealing his coveralls. Michael completes his journey by returning to his home. Under the floorboards, he finds the knife with which he murdered his family, and the white William Shatner mask, now tarnished and dirty.<br /><br />The story shifts to that of LAURIE STRODE (played by Scout Taylor-Compton). Laurie is living a happy life with her parents, CYNTHIA STRODE (played by Dee Wallace) and MASON STRODE (played by Pat Skipper). As she heads off to school, Laurie is met by TOMMY DOYLE (played by Skyler Gosondo), a boy she babysits. They pass the old Myers home, where Laurie must drop off an envelope for her father. Tommy warns her not to go near the house, as the boogeyman lives there. Laurie toys with Tommy, while Michael watches from inside the house. At school, Laurie and her best friends, ANNIE BRACKETT (played by Danielle Harris) and LYNDA van der KLOK (played by Kristina Klebe), make plans for Halloween night as Laurie notices Michael watching her from outside. Annie convinces Laurie to babysit for her that night, so Annie can meet with her boyfriend Paul. Meanwhile, Loomis arrives in Haddonfield to find the Myers's gravestone missing and the grave vandalized with a crucified animal carcass. On the way home from school, Laurie notices Michael again, and Lynda and Annie mock him. Annie is picked up by her father, LEE BRACKETT (played by Brad Dourif, the voice of Chucky, the killer doll), the town sheriff, who offers Annie a ride home. Lynda also eventually leaves, and Laurie is followed home by Michael. That evening, Laurie leaves her home with Annie to babysit at Tommy's house. After they leave, Michael murders the Strode family. Michael then returns to his house, only to find Lynda and her boyfriend, BOB SIMMS (played by Mick Mennell), having sex. Bob leaves the living room to get more beer, and is met halfway back by Michael, who impales him to a wall with his knife. Michael puts a sheet over his head while wearing Bob's glasses. Lynda mistakes Michael for Bob, and as she turns around, Michael strangles her to death.<br /><br />At the Doyle house, Annie leaves Lindsey Wallace with Laurie and Tommy. Annie then returns home to be with her boyfriend PAUL (played by Max van Ville). While they have sex, Michael comes and murders Paul, while severely beating Annie. Meanwhile, Sheriff Brackett, convinced by Loomis that Michael is in Haddonfield, is searching the town in his patrol car. He tells Loomis that he responded to the 9-1-1 call for Deborah Myers's suicide. He found the young baby sister, but did not want her to grow up knowing what happened to her family. He took her to a foster home, where she was adopted by the Strode family.<br /><br />Laurie heads back to the Wallace home to take by Lindsey, when they two find the bodies of Paul and Annie. Paul is dead, hung from the ceiling rafters with a jack o' lantern on his head, while Annie is severely injured, but alive. Laurie tells Lindsey to go back to Tommy's house, while she calls 9-1-1. As Lindsey leaves, Michael, who was hiding behind the door, shuts it, and begins to chase Laurie. Laurie outruns Michael to the Doyle house, and she and the children look themselves in a room. As police officers arrive, Michael kills the officers, breaks into the bathroom and takes Laurie. Loomis and Brackett, responding to Laurie's 9-1-1 call, finally arrive at Lindsey's house to find Annie still alive on the floor. Loomis leaves, only to see Tommy and Lindsey, screaming in the street. They tell him where Michael went, and Loomis follows, armed with a .357 Magnum handgun.<br /><br />Laurie awakes in the Myers house, next to the gravestone of Judith Myers and the naked body of Lynda. Michael enters, placing his knife on the ground and taking off his mask. He kneels down and offers Laurie his picture of them as children. Laurie cries and tells him she doesn't understand, but then reaches for the knife and stabs Michael in the shoulder. Laurie slips away, but Michael corners her after she falls into a drained swimming pool. Loomis appears and shoots Michael three times. He falls, evidently dead. Loomis gets Laurie inside the police car, where Laurie asks, "Was that the boogeyman?" Loomis responds, "As a matter of fact, I do believe that was." Michael suddenly breaks through the window and grabs Laurie. Loomis chases after them, and tells Michael he was the one who failed by giving up on him. Michael lets Laurie go, and grabs Loomis, crushing his skull.<br /><br />Laurie hides inside the Myers house as Michael drags Loomis's body inside. Michael searches for Laurie, smashing the frail walls. Laurie grabs Loomis's gun, and hides in the attic. Michael then grabs a plank of wood, and begins bashing it through the ceiling. Laurie nearly escapes, but falls through the ceiling into a bedroom. Michael enters the room, and as she raises the gun, he charges at her sending both through the second story window to the ground below. Laurie comes to, lying on top of an unconscious Myers and attempts to shoot him, but the first few shots are empty. Michael recovers, grabbing Laurie's hand as she shoots again. The gun fires, hitting Michael in the head. Laurie, covered with blood, screams in terror as the film abruptly cuts to credits.<br /><br />  As I said before, Rob Zombie's remake of the 1978 Horror classic, is simply outstanding. I was expecting a great remake, but this outstanding was not what I had expected. Out of all the Horror movies that were remade in the last few years, this is the best out of them all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>Nothing makes a monster less terrifying than giving him a sympathetic backstory.  Rob Zombie's re-imagining of the Carpenter classic succeeds exactly where it SHOULDN'T:  it humanizes the main villain.<br /><br />Audience mindset:  "Oh, of COURSE he turned out that way!  Poor kid, he's been through so much.  Oh well, la dee dah...la dee dah.  Okay, now the movie is in its second half and we can watch the carnage, which is really why we came, right?  We didn't come to see a well-made movie or an intelligent script.  We came for the carnage."<br /><br />This film is unchallenging and disappointing.  I'm sure the kiddies will love it because it is loud, violent, and viceral.  But most intelligent film-goers will dislike or even resent this movie for its endless list of flaws.  It is a popcorn movie, nothing more.  It will soon be forgotten by nearly everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A34IBXM7E8CPWE.html">A34IBXM7E8CPWE</a><br/><p>When Rob Zombie's "Halloween" first came out, despite my initial reaction to anyone trying to remake Carpenter's classic, I went to see it in the theater. I hated it! Outside of the soundtrack, I thought there was little to no value in Zombie's film.<br /><br />For lack of anything better to watch I decided to give the movie another shot. I have to say I was pleasently surprised. While I still hate the opening 5 - 10 minutes or so (I think Zombie was a bit ham handed  and over the top in making sure the viewer knew Michael came from a dysfunctional family), the rest of the film was pretty gripping and interesting.<br /><br />As the movie starts out, we are introduced to the Myers family. A family so dysfunctional they would have to go to therapy in order to move into a trailer park. Stripper Mom, Alcoholic and Abusive Step-Dad, Trampy older sister named Judy, Wierdo and bullied Michael and the baby Laurie. Some people didn't like that we got Michael's backstory, I was one of them initially, because it was bit creepier thinking that Mike came from a good home and just snapped like in the original. With Zombie's film we get to see what creates the hulking psychopath seen in the second half of the film. When Michael finally snaps and kills one of the bullies from his school, it starts the killing spree that will conclude on Halloween night 18 years later (or continues 18 years later once the sequel came out?).<br /><br />Institutionalized because of the murders, Michael meets Dr. Loomis, a psychiatrist that initially tries to help Michael, but later exploits him and his crimes. Michael spends most of his life locked away in a small room, hiding and wearing masks of his own design until one Halloween night he decides to go home and find his little sister.<br /><br />Very bloody, boob filled and violent as all get out, Zombie definately makes the story his own. Zombie's version of Michael Myers is similar to the classic portrayal of Jason Voorhees from the "Friday the 13th" films, an unstoppable hulking, silent killer. In the old "Halloween" films, Michael was the boogeyman that lurked and popped up out of the dark. If you go into this film hoping to see Michael lurking in the background, slowly sneaking up on his prey...you'll hate this movie. There is nothing subtle about the scare or Michael in this movie.<br /><br />And while I don't think Zombie's version is nearly as good as Carpenter's classic, it's a good deal better than part's 4, 5, 6, & Resurrection. Zombie at least made Myers scary again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI.html">A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI</a><br/><p>5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />I love the original "Halloween," but I got to admit, I like Zombie's remake better, if only for it's true to life cruel dysfunctional realism.<br /><br />Zombie has not only remade the film, but he has re-created the story & has in the process, transcended the original in terms of plausibility, verses the supernatural unstoppable "Shape." Here we get to see the making of a serial killing psychopath machine! Outwardly, Michael is unemotional pure unadulterated evil. Inside, a smoldering anger of a young child left to ferment in his hatred of all those who surround him, & mostly, his hatred of himself.<br /><br />A terrifying portrait of what can be wrought on to others by a person whose years of systematic abuse by his family, & by those who ostracize him from society, filled with malicious school bullies, to a psychologist exploiting him for personal monetary gain & fame. This is Michael Myers life, not a life as most know it, but an existence blindly feeding off of hate & self loathing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GANR9I6XHTU9.html">A2GANR9I6XHTU9</a><br/><p>This isnt Halloween, this is a Redneck Halloween wannabee...<br /><br />This is what happens when people can't think of any new ideas. First try to copy and imitate the Texas Chainsaw Massacre with one movie... now do a remake of a classic and fail miserably.<br /><br />What exactly does this have to do with the original?... This is Rob Zombie's warped version of a classic.<br /><br />We have some twisted version of the 1970's with a family of Rednecks. Michael Myers is their child.  You can see the kids face- There is no mystery in this at all-  Then we have the same plot as the original with different things added. Then the story switches over to present day and the same old story except 10 times worse.  Here we have Malcolm McDowell as Doctor Loomis and the lady from E.T.... Even these good actors couldnt save this mess of a movie.<br /><br /> The horror genre really needs to think up something new instead of recyling the same old movies and failing at it. You have the greats and then you have the copiers and imitators who end up trying to copy legends and failing everytime. This is another example of that.  I strongly recomend you do not see this-  it will disapoint you. This is one of those movies that makes you wonder if theres any real future for the horror genre.</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>As you might have read on my other reviews, I am a Halloween fan. In truth I loved the original, the second, and H20 only (The others were not that good at all). This film however, is an overly vulgar, too over the top, too brutal, and horribly written crappy disaster. It ruins Halloween. My suggestion is that you ignore this schlock and stick with the true Halloween trilogy of 1, 2, and H20.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DRKVXO300RUE.html">A1DRKVXO300RUE</a><br/><p>Let me preface by saying that I really enjoy House of 1000 Corpses and of course consider Halloween to be one of the all time greatest movies.  So this seemed like the perfect movie - one of the most immortal concepts ever paired with a modern day highly creative director.  Wrong.  Like M. Night Shamalamadingdong, Zombie's movies have been progressively terrible as he went forward.  House of 1000 Corpses was fantastic - great sets and visuals.  However, every other release has been a disaster, and this movie is no exception, and is an insult to the Halloween tradition.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>First of all, I think Rob Zombie is just getting better and better at this. Afterall, I thought the best he had to offer was "House of a 1000 Corpses" and "The Devil's Rejects" but this movie exceeded all expectations that I had. Secondly, I am pleasantly surprised to see that his wife Sherry Moon Zombie can actually act which I was highly doubtful of in the beginning. To be quite honest, I don't know if this movie can be considered a remake or a prequel, but maybe, it's Zombie's vision of Michael Myers, and this was his take on the story. Thus, giving the audience an understanding of why Michael Myers is the monster that he is. Personally, I think Rob Zombie's mission is to breathe life back into the horror genre that has been dead and buried for some time now thanks to the lack of originality by "the powers that be." I believe his mission has been accomplished with this version of Halloween. This movie is not some "teen slasher" fluke, nor is it for for the squeamish at all, and it's the closest thing you'll find to scary these days. It starts off showing Michael Myers as a 10 year old boy. Michael's mother is a stripper, his stepfather is abusive, and his older sister is a slut. Michael is also tormented at school by fellow classmates. In fact, the only things that Michael finds any solice in, is torturing and killing animals and his ability to create masks. The only person Michael even relates to is his baby sister. On Halloween, Michael snaps by beating one of his bullies to death in the woods behind the school. Later on that night, he kills his stepfather, sister, and her boyfriend after they refuse to take him trick or treating. After that, Michael is institutionalized for having no knowledge of even commiting these murders. I think we all know the rest of the story from here. At any rate, this movie goes inside the mind of one of the sickest, most brutal killers of all time. I hate to have to spoil some of the ending for those who haven't seen it yet, but the one reasons I don't think this is a prequel or a remake because Michael kills Dr. Loomis in this one, and we all know for this to be a prequel or a remake that can't be possible. Other than that small detail.. I LOVED IT!</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>Ever since the announcement that Rob Zombie would be re-imagining John Carpenterfs slasher classic Halloween, critics and horror fans alike have been picking sides, alternately at arms over what they saw as a modern travesty and supportive of Zombiefs ability to recreate and update the thrills of what many consider the original slasher flick (though Black Christmas - recently reworked for 2006fs Black Xmas - appeared in Canada over four years earlier than the original Halloween).<br /><br />The film's release in late August did little to quell the controversy: critics panned it and audiences showed up in droves to push the film to a record-breaking Labor Day weekend opening. Regardless of critics words and filmgoers money, though, where does Rob Zombie's Halloween stand in the annals of horror movie history? After viewing the unrated directorfs cut of the film, along with a second disc packed full of special features, it's not a clear cut (no pun intended) victory for either side. If anything is clear, it's what Zombie attempted to do with his re-imagining: 1. Propel his film career forward by exposing himself to a wider fanbase, and 2. Attempt to psychologically deconstruct one of American horrorfs most infamous killers. Itfs obvious from the film's box office numbers that Zombie accomplished his first goal, but the second goal is a little more difficult to assess.<br /><br />Opening in 1978 (a clever nod to the year the original film came out), the audience witnesses a young Michael Myers (eeriely portrayed by young Daeg Faerch) navigating his way through an abusive household, getting bullied by older kids at school, and being neglected by his stripper mother (played by Zombiefs own wife Sheri Moon Zombie). Though the opening scenes are raw and gritty - Zombies specialty - the foulness and crassness of the Myers household actually begins to take away from the assertion that Michael Myers, like Damien from The Omen, was simply born disturbed and evil. The incessant ranting by his motherfs boyfriend, and the older punks at school may serve as worthy impetuses for Michaelfs repressed violent nature and help explain his desire to hide behind a mask, but ultimately this takes away from the simple horror of a psychotic killer arising from a typical, run-of-the-mill household.<br /><br />As Michael tortures and kills his pet rats, itfs clear Zombie is drawing on real serial killer history (animal torture is an early sign of sociopathy).  The reworking of the initial murder scene from the first Halloween is also strikingly impressive. In fact, for the first hour of the film, as Zombie's Myers unfolds before a bewildered audience, it starts to feel as if Zombie may have done the unthinkable and successfully created a back story that both evokes the original and adds new haunting layers to it. Malcolm McDowellfs intense Dr. Loomis provides a credible foil to Myersf silent stoicism, and playing on the mask theme works in Zombie's favor as little Michael quietly tells his mother that the mask hides [his] ugliness.<br /><br />Unfortunately, once the inevitable fast-forward 15 years occurs and an older Michael Myers is accidentally let free of his sanitarium cell (in one of the most overly and unnecessarily perverse scenes in recent history) all hell breaks loose - both on and off screen. Michael sets off on his rampage of violence and Zombie's screenwriting prowess is tested beyond its breaking point. As anyone who saw The Devil's Rejects knows, Zombie is somewhat of a master at the disturbing, the subversive, and the grotesque, but when it comes to writing dialogue for suburban families and teenie bopper girlfriends, Zombie is out of his element, and his film suffers for it. Rather than continuing along the semi-realistic slant he had been following, suddenly Zombie begins to flounder. The conversations are stilted and unnatural and no character manages to evoke even a hint of redeeming qualities.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Myers roams the street in broad daylight, with nary a frightened pedestrian in sight. This concept may have worked if Myers were of normal stature, but the casting of the 6' 8" WCW star Tyler Mane as Myers makes his bemasked public appearances on quiet suburban sidewalks a little too imposing to go unnoticed. That's not to say that Mane's portrayal of the masked killer is at all faulty. His hulking physical presence and vacant stares provide more than enough chills to go around. But by the same token, those same qualities almost demand that Myers remain in the shadows as he did in the original.<br /><br />Scout Taylor-Compton has little to offer as Myers' sole surviving relative Laurie Strode. A few painful scenes as a babysitter and some even more painful screaming and crying will leave audiences feeling more pain than perhaps Laurie herself feels. The fact that she can never find her way out of a mess and insists on constantly running up stairs does little to endear her to audiences. In fact, she made such a minimal impression in Zombie's original script that he changed the ending to ensure that she grew as a character. (The original ending is included in the special features).<br /><br />Zombie's film does up the gore factor considerably, and the nudity factor as well. These unneeded additions could be nods to the unillustrious history of the horror/slasher film, or they could just be softballs to a built in audience Zombie is seeking to connect with; either way they're taken straight out of the Horror 101 handbook. Still, this 2007 Halloween towers over the recent glut of horror classic remakes that have hit theatres: The Omen, The Amityville Horror, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Fog, House of Wax, The Hitcher, Black Christmas, The Wicker Manc etc. Only The Hills Have Eyes and Halloween have had the audacity to do more than simply remake the originals with glossier film. Instead these films have taken the original concepts and expanded on them for a new generation of viewers.<br /><br />While Rob Zombie's Halloween has done nothing to tarnish his name, it's also done nothing to improve upon his filmmaking cred. Perhaps the leap from House of 1000 Corpses to The Devil's Rejects was so vast that audiences should have expected a bit of levelling out with his newest film, but here's hoping he'll continue to push the envelope that he opened with his impressively unique and startlingly dark foray into the world of film.<br /><br />The second disc of special features is exceptionally broad, and even includes a six minute blooper reel (mainly featuring Malcom McDowell's superbly un-PC riffs). A breakdown of the mask construction and a discussion with director Rob Zombie on his re-imagining offer a good deal of information for anyone interestd. The deleted scenes are here, but of course itfs clear that theyfve been deleted for a reason.  There's a brief breakdown of the entire cast, as well as clips from casting sessions. Much like the film itself, this special features disc leaves little to the viewer's imagination, but if you don't want to know, don't watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>Ridley Scott's American Gangster about real life bad guy and drug lord, Frank Lucas, in American Gangster receives two Oscar noms.  Forrest Whitaker won an Oscar for his portrayal of Ugandan dictator, Idi Amin.  Who says you can't do a biopic film of a fictional character?  Rob Zombie does just that in this biography, not remake, of horror icon Michael Myers.  I would also guess that more Americans have probably heard of the fictional, Michael Myers, than Amin, or Lucas.<br /><br />Zombie's Halloween goes into detail of Michael as a child, while there is still something of a child left, and the hell on earth that exists in many households.  Michael Myers will become the manifestation of evil in society.  Halloween was reminiscent of David Cronenberg's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009PY2T">The Brood</a> and how the mother's anger physically manifested itself as she spawned deformed children to seek out what angered her.  Unlike the mother in The Brood Michael doesn't lash out at society but becomes the evil in society and eventually will no longer be human.  True evil cannot be stopped with a gun or a knife and neither can Michael Myers.<br /><br />My point is Zombie's film can be looked at as poetic and a message for non violence (you think I'm crazy).  Michael Myers is a metaphor for the evil in our society, specifically the evil that hides in the suburbs behind closed doors.  Myers uses a mask to hide this evil as suburbs could mask this with white picket fence as a happy front. If you can't use violence to stop this evil as we do in our society then you have to go to the roots, the family and family values.  Similarly the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143038257">Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Promote Peace . . . One School at a Time</a> which uses education to fight terror where it starts and not bombs.<br /><br />There are two moments in the film where, Michael Myers, the boy fights that evil.  The first, after Michael has murdered his family and is locked away in an institution he has an emotional breakdown with Dr. Loomis at Christmas time.  Michael for an instant realizes the situation and is terrified this reminded me of Regan in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/079073804X">The Exorcist (25th Anniversary Special Edition)</a> as the demon left her.  Flash to the next scene and Michael is gone and the evil has taken him.  The second moment after Michael has kidnapped Laurie he once again becomes human for a  moment, drops his knife, and shows his face to his sister, once Laurie stabs him and he puts the mask back on Michael is now dead and there is only evil.<br /><br />Zombie has a stellar cast of horror veterans that there are too many to list.  Zombie does not use this as a gimmick or to wink at horror fans the film is taken seriously from beginning to end and their are solid performances all around.  Rob Zombie seems to get better with each film as does his wife Sheri Moon Zombie who gave a solid performance as Michael's mother.  The photograph that is shown at the end was very effective and tragic.<br /><br />DVD FEATURES<br />On Amazon it says the theatrical version is presented in Full Screen only but Disc I contains both Full Screen and Wide Screen versions. - Feature commentary by Writer/Director Rob Zombie as well.<br /><br />Disc II<br />Alternate Ending - Deleted Scenes with optional Directory's commentary - Bloopers- The Many Masks of Michael Myers - Re Imagining Halloween - Meet the cast - Casting Sessions - Laurie Strode Scree Test - Theatrical Trailer.<br /><br />I have seen both the unrated and theatrical versions and theatrical version is the one to go with by a mile.  The unrated just throws in to many over the top incidents that really aren't needed.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Remaking a classic horror film is almost never a good idea. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00018D42W">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ABURA">Dawn of the Dead (Widescreen Unrated Director's Cut)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NO3DLG">The Hitcher (Widescreen Edition)</a> are examples of recent remakes that are inferior shadows of their original selves. And so it came with great disappointment when it was announced that John Carpenter's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009UW0N">Halloween (Divimax 25th Anniversary Edition)</a> was going to be remade and Rob Zombie would direct. Known mostly for his music with White Zombie and a successful solo career, he's branched out into making films, including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AXWHSA">The Devil's Rejects (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>, a down `n' dirty homage to outlaw cinema of the 1970s. Why would a self-professed horror film buff like Zombie even try to remake a revered classic like Halloween? Hubris? Fanboy wish fulfillment? Or, did he figure that this film was going to be made one way or another and rather than let some hack do a crappy job; he could at least bring his stylistic touches and point-of-view to the table.<br /><br />Zombie's remake works because he takes the Halloween mythos and expands it in all kinds of fascinating ways. He makes some really intriguing choices like not making Michael supernaturally strong but rather a big guy who is naturally tough and strong. Zombie also opts for gritty realism like he did with The Devil's Rejects and it is a smart choice that works. Whether you love or hate his take on the material, you have to admit that it doesn't resemble Carpenter's film in any way. It is easily the best Halloween film since Part III, although that isn't really saying much when you consider the quality of the subsequent sequels.<br /><br />The first disc features an audio commentary by writer/director Rob Zombie. He points out the various locations they shot in while also drawing our attention to where he took footage out and why. Zombie spends a lot of time talking about the challenges he faced on certain scenes. He also points out the new footage in this cut and why he put it back. The filmmaker delivers another solid commentary that is well worth a listen if you're a fan of this film.<br /><br />The second disc starts of with 17 deleted scenes with optional commentary by Zombie. Unlike some auteurs, he is refreshingly ruthless with his footage and so we have a lot of scenes that were cut, including more of the strip club where Michael's mom works. There's also more of Loomis talking to a young Michael. Michael also attends a parole hearing that features a character played Tom Towles. Adrienne Barbeau even shows up briefly in a scene with Loomis. Zombie does a good job explaining why these scenes were cut.<br /><br />Also included is an "Alternate Ending" with optional commentary by Zombie. This one is more sympathetic to Michael but wasn't satisfying enough for the director and he went with the other ending which is much more visceral.<br /><br />"Bloopers" features footage of McDowell cracking up with Sheri Moon Zombie take after take. It turns out that the veteran actor is a real goofball and looks like he's having a blast making his fellow actors laugh.<br /><br />"The Many Masks of Michael Myers" takes a look at how they constructed the iconic Michael Myers mask. They created several versions, including clean ones and then gradually grungy ones to symbolize the passage of time. We also see how the put together the various ones that Michael makes in the sanitarium.<br /><br />"Re-Imagining Halloween" is a three-part look at various aspects of the making of the film. Zombie wanted to shoot it in the style of 21 Grams and The Constant Gardener. He wanted the three acts to have their own distinctive looks: the first part was all hand-held cameras, the second was very static, and the third act used lots of steadicam work. The film's production design is examined. They take a look at the various sets and briefly talk about the specific look Zombie was after. The makeup effects are also featured. This involved a lot of work as Michael kills a lot of people. Zombie wanted them to look realistic and we see how some of the kills were done.<br /><br />"Meet the Cast." Zombie says that the casting process is the most exciting part of the filmmaking process for him because it is the first time the film feels real. He talks about why he cast the actors that he did and, in turn, they talk about their approach to the characters and a bit about working on the film.<br /><br />"Casting Sessions" is a collection of excerpts of audition footage of the cast members. It gives us a chance to see what convinced Zombie to hire them.<br /><br />"Scout Taylor-Compton Screen Test" features more footage of this young actress testing for the role of Laurie Strode. It is easy to see why she was cast as she nails the role.<br /><br />Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EZHMGGWY74HY.html">A3EZHMGGWY74HY</a><br/><p>I am a huge fan of the original Halloween, so took a chance on this one.  Although I always thought that the original film left gaps in the story...why was Michael the way he was?...yes, Rob answered this for us folks, but how difficult it was to watch this poor boy living in this over the top dysfunctional home! It makes sense to the story, but I found it too disturbing to watch. He was a much more believable Michael, we understood where he was coming from, his pain was too huge for a young child to handle...but did I really want to know these details and suffer along with this young boy?  Heck, no! To top it all off, Zombie movies (which I should have known!) are far too grotesque and bloody for my taste.  The original movie had just the right amount of gore, suspense, scary music and fear.  I didn't need to be taken to the next level of horror, so I shut the movie off.  I never finished it because what I had seen was more than enough.  I wondered, afterward, about our society and what makes us love these type of movies.  If these horrific events happened to anyone we knew, we wouldn't be so anxious to watch them on the big screen. The fact is that the world is hard enough, scary enough, dark enough...we hardly need to be on a journey of insanity for two hours and then watch the bonus features so we can see more about how they made the gore fest come to life! This one is just over the top, and not enough of an improvement on the original to make it worth seeing.  Watch some quality horror, something that scares you, but doesn't make you want to be sick.</p></br><a href="../users/AJD9EA658HCFW.html">AJD9EA658HCFW</a><br/><p>I am a big Fan of the Halloween franchise but I have to say that this movie did not live up to the original Halloween movie. The reason why I say this is because I think (if this is possible) there was too much gore in this movie. I know that is kind of the point of a horror movie, but I think Rob Zombie went over board.<br />However, it was cool to see Mike Myers again!! Lets hope that Halloween 2 (directed by Rob Zombie) turns out better.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>If you're looking for a re-do of John Carpenter's 1978 classic version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RIWAVW">Halloween</a>, you won't really get that with Rob Zombie's re-make. And to me that's a good thing; Zombie attempts to re-invent the Michael Myers character in his version versus basically doing over what was already done masterfully with the original.<br /><br />So what I suggest that you do is go into this movie with the above understanding. Because if you're a preservationist that doesn't want his classics messed with, then Zombie's adaptation will probably leave you angry and unsatisfied. I, on the other hand, was quite entertained by Zombie's Halloween. After all, a simple re-do that adds nothing new to what was already solidly in place would be pointless, right?<br /><br />Yes...I said "re-do" as opposed to "re-make". A re-make is when a director takes an old film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it different, and ideally, *better*. A re-do is when a director takes a film and adds nothing to the original. Zombie may not have made a *better* movie than the original, but he sure did give the movie a unique spin.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is devoted to telling the Michael Myers story. The movie starts by showing Myers' at age 10 or 11. It's during this time that Zombie chronicles how Myers went from troubled to tormented to demented to completely psychopathic. The movie flash forwards 15 years through Myers incarceration and ultimate escape to wreak havoc on the infamous town of Haddonfield just like in the original.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is very well done to the point I was saying to myself that "this is a great movie." But then in the second half it collapses a bit with too many clich&eacute; horror movie "oh that would never really happen" moments. You know, like the police don't believe there's any danger and they're stupid; people venturing into places that you know they'd never go...especially on the heels of the warning that Myers could be in town; and the whole point of the first half of the movie seemed to attempt to show that Myers was human and just a psychopath, but that starts to go out the window in the second half as Myers starts showing a few immortal traits.<br /><br />But, like I said, I was entertained. The cast is pretty good, and the kid that played Myers at age 10 was outstanding. This re-make is definitely worth a watch for horror fans, but devoted fans of the original might want to take a pass.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Halloween (Rob Zombie, 2007)<br /><br />Despite my contempt for the current Hollywood remake craze, I somehow can't stop myself from watching them despite knowing that almost every remake will find some way to mess itself up, even when it tries to be slavishly faithful (think Gus van Sant's shot-by-shot Psycho remake here). It's very rare that a remake gets it even half-right, and when someone does a remake and attempts to add something, that way lies madness. Except when it works. I know I'm probably in the minority in thinking so--after all, the whole reason Michael Myers is scary in John Carpenter's classic Halloween is that we have absolutely no idea how he got that way, save for one scene at the beginning of the movie that tells us he's already messed up by the time he's ten years old--but I think Rob Zombie giving us Michael Myers' backstory in his Halloween remake actually works.<br /><br />In case you've been underwater for the last thirty years, the plot: a youngster named Michael Myers (played as a youth by Hancock's Daeg Faerch, as an adult by X-Men's Tyler Mane), sick of his abusive family, snaps and offs his stepfather and older sister. When his mother (played by Zombie's wife, Sheri Moon) gets home from her shift at the strip club, Myers is sitting outside the house holding his baby sister. Following this bit, we get half an hour of Myers growing up in the institution, being counselled by Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell, about as perfect a replacement for Donald Pleasance as possible). Myers, of course, breaks ourt and heads back to Haddonfield, spending the rest of the film terrorizing Laurie Strode (Wicked Little Things' Scout Taylor-Compton) and her pals.<br /><br />Why does the backstory bit work here? Because Rob Zombie actually thought about it. From the looks of things, he spent years thinking about it. I grant you, it's pretty basic slasher-movie psychology these days--you have to try and make the killer sympathetic by showing that he was abused as a kid or whatever--but the kicker is that Zombie never once attempts to make Michael Myers in any way sympathetic. (You get the feeling for a while he's going to, but he resists the temptation.) It's a subtle subversion of that same slasher-movie psychology Zombie is borrowing wholesale, and it works. In fact, it's kind of brilliant, if you turn your head and squint the right way. Unfortunately, the film falls apart after that, becoming as generic a slasher movie as has come down the pike in some time, but the promise of the first half tells me Rob Zombie may actually be putting it together as a filmmaker. Much better than I expected. ***</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>I wasn't overly impressed w/ Rob Zombie's HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES. I thought THE DEVIL'S REJECTS was quite an improvement. Now, Zombie takes one of the all-time classic horror milestones and "re-imagines" it?? WTF?? I figured this would truly be a catastrophic failure! I put off seeing it for a year. Well, I watched HALLOWEEN last night, and couldn't believe how wrong I was! Zombie has not simply rehashed the original, he has recast it in a more modern and psychologically satisfying way. John Carpenter's Michael Myers was perfect for his day (and for any day, really)- a silent, faceless, relentless killing machine, without any personal history. A murderous enigma. Zombie has given Michael motivation and purpose. He has fleshed-out his childhood, much like HANNIBAL RISING did for Lector. I look at Zombie's HALLOWEEN as a seperate and completely different movie from the original. In the same way that I love both the originals and the remakes of DAWN OF THE DEAD and THE HILLS HAVE EYES for example, I can watch and enjoy either HALLOWEEN. Tyler Mane is an awesome, imposing Michael. He seems like he's 9 ft tall! Giving him a back-story did not lessen his horrifying and utterly lethal character. If anything, it added depth to the overall story. Still, either Michael- oldschool or new -is the stuff of wonderful, grisly nightmares...  P.S.- the number of cameos in this movie is wild! Sybil Danning (Reform School Girls)! Clint Howard (Evilspeak)! Ken Foree (Dawn Of The Dead, From Beyond)! Udo Kier (Andy Warhol's Dracula)! Dee Wallace (The Hills Have Eyes, Cujo, The Howling)! And so many more!...</p></br><a href="../users/A1N49TOJZFG48H.html">A1N49TOJZFG48H</a><br/><p>i sure liked the title to that Rob Zombie disc that came out some years back now .

My review is for the unrated 3 disc set from Circuit City.<br /><br />I went into this film with the mind set that this was a Halloween movie from a parallel universe. If you want to enjoy this film, try not think of it as a remake....OK?...alright, here we go.<br /><br />This film is well produced and the first half deals with young Michael Myers at age 10. Although sort of interesting to watch, it really doesn't give us much more insight than the original on why he's so evil. Carpenter's film leaves  a lot to the imagination and we all know that what we conjure in our own minds is usually scarier than what we see on screen. This is a new Halloween and we get to see some brutal murders unlike the original. This isn't necessarily a bad a thing.....well,.... I usually don't complain (too much) about really stupid scenes in horror movies, but this film has some real bad ones! Michael is in the mental institution for brutal murders and yet he walks around unchained and is allowed to use forks and knives when he's eating! I guess so he can stab and kill a nurse who is left alone to watch him.<br /><br />Unlike the original in which "The Shape" was actually a slender man and or supernatural being, this guy is huge and should have been restrained in a straight jacket 24/7! I only mention this because it appears Zombie is trying to make this character more "human". Well that requires making sense throughout the film. When a couple of "boneheads" who work in the hospital try to have their way with a new young female patient, what do they do?........ well, they bring her over to Michael Myer's room where the gigantic lunatic(who loves to kill people)sits making his disturbing masks and they rape her with their backs turned to Mr. Myers! Then, they antagonize and hit Mr. Myers as if he isn't a threat! It's scenes like these that keep this from being a much better movie.<br /><br />I had no problem sitting through it's 2 hour time length, but I kept thinking how close Zombie came to making a good horror film. As it is,(at least the unrated version I saw), it's a 2 1/2 star horror film. Only in the last 25 minutes or so did it finally build some tension, something the original had in spades! The Michael Myers in this film does look menacing and the film has an upgraded slick look, so Zombie's heart was in the right place. Some things he got very wrong...Unlike the original, I didn't feel this film had anything to do with Halloween as it just seemed to be in the distant background of the film. Carpenter's version was all about Halloween. Also, making Myers a human nut job took a lot away from the unknown eerieness of the character in the original.<br /><br />The unrated edition has a great transfer and lots of extra goodies. My version had a third disc with the cast at comic con doing a question and answers gig. Now that I have seen the theatrical version, I would have to recommend it over the unrated one, even with some slightly trimmed down gore, it's a way better movie and makes more sense! I give the theatrical version 3 1/2 stars!</p></br><a href="../users/A3RB6NQOLOBXYD.html">A3RB6NQOLOBXYD</a><br/><p>Upon the anticipation of one of my favorite holidays, I felt it was necessary, if not crucial to dabble in some suspenseful and horrifying cinema this week. The suspense, or lack thereof, mostly resulted into a depressing and horrific cinematic experience. It was so horrifying to see a remake fail in all aspects, visually and cinematically that I could almost hear John Carpenter's hair turn whiter as he chain-smokes his last and final cigarette.<br /><br />The truth is I happen to be a fan of Rob Zombie's previous films; moreover, I appreciated his passion for cult horror movies that sometimes incorporated the sort of nostalgic drive-in movie era. Upon hearing a remake of Carpenter's classic, I became annoyed and disappointed at first, but was soon relieved to find out it was someone not only worthy of creativity but truly passionate about these type of slasher films that Zombie cares about so much. Boy, was I profoundly disappointed in Zombie's "re-imaging" of Halloween, or shall I call it a sheer massacre.<br /><br />For the first 45-50 minutes of the film, We get a lengthy and interminable back round of Michael's Myer's psychology; the rationale; he comes from a broken home with a mother who strips late night to make ends meet, a dead-beat father figure who incessantly call his boy, "faget", and an uncaring older sister who is about as uninteresting as the film. At school, it is no different as Michael endures a myriad of tortures from school bullies who appear about as non-threatening as a senile old lady. The young boy playing Michael Myer's childhood was disturbing in the sense that he was scarier looking without the mask as his girlish blonde hair, pre-adolescent chubby face and crooked teeth rendered him retarded looking. The bottom line is that Rob Zombie's approach into making Michael Myer's character more sympathetic to the audience truly defies John Carpenter's intentions. I honestly loathed the weak climatic build up of Michael Myer's mental breakdown if you could call it that; personally it looked like a rebellious pre-pubescent hissy fit. It was a tough pill to swallow to take Myer's childhood seriously and even more so when he's battering his sister's boyfriend brains with a baseball bat, or slitting William Forsythe's throat. Even Malcolm Mcdowell's psychological evaluation of Michael Myer's meltdown in the mental institution came off as incredibly corny adding entirely no substance to the film; it was uninformative and just plain boring. I just hope they paid Mcdowell a pretty penny to waste his valuable acting skills on this film, but that is beside the point.<br /><br />After the long introduction horror fans of the genre finally get to see the true modern Michael Myer's we've been waiting for, the result, a 280 lb. 6'8 gorilla. Hey who would of thought Michael Meyer's physique would mimic an NFL coaches wet dream. This is another problem I had with this film, Rob Zombie thought it was necessary to seriously upgrade Myer's physique, bad idea... what were they feeding this kid at the mental institution, HGH and testosterone! His figure looks overbearing in the film to the point where his on-screen presence looks inhuman and far too dominating as his broad shoulders and towering height look more like a Caterpillar bulldozer at a construction site. In all seriousness, I had difficulty deciphering whether Myer's was suffering from middle-child syndrome or exhibiting symptoms of roid rage, which is probably the only mysterious enigma about Myer's Psychology in the entire film. Personally, I thought what made Carpenter's Myer's more frightening is that he appeared more average and less animated. It was his slow but persevering amble that gave me the chills, not a fast over dominating beast that broke through every door and main beam in that house. It was ridiculous and nauseating to witness Zombie's over extended chase scenes that really amounted to sheer emptiness and dissatisfaction in the end. In other words, the pay-off sucked big time. The editing overall was pretty weak as well, a few interesting wide-angle shots in the mental institution accompanied by more mundane uninteresting chase scenes. Rob Zombie also upgrades the violence as well but it fails miserably to compensate for the lack of suspense. As a result, the violence comes off as incredibly gratuitous and unwarranted. However, I cannot bash the nudity even though it delivered the same unjustified result as the violence. It was almost as if Robb Zombie was forcing the nudity as if saying, "I can show bush in my Halloween and get away with it".<br /><br />Despite my criticism, there are some few and sparse redeeming qualities such as the authenticity of recapturing the 1970's feel which Rob Zombie subtlety recaptures and manages to weave into the film. Sheri Moon Zombie actually pulls it off kind of nicely, maybe it was her carefully selected wardrobe or her soft dirty blonde hair, couldn't tell you but her looks worked for the time being. Her acting is another story, I won't go there, but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and say its serviceable at best. Rob Zombie throws in some 70's one hit wonders, some Blue oyster Cult, which is also featured in Carpenter's version when Jamie Lee Curtis is driving with PJ Soles, Rush and Nazareth. The only interesting relationship I found was that between Dr. Loomis and Michael Myers in the mental institution and Sid Haig's quick cameo, other than that the character development was extremely weak leaving me disconnected from relating to anybody.<br /> I did get through most of the bonus features and even some of that 4 ? hour documentary. There are some interesting bonus features, just about enough to last you through next Halloween. Horror Fans will enjoy the 2nd disc with interviews and behind the scenes, along with a 3rd disc step by step "making of documentary of the entire movie. Despite Rob Zombie's catastrophic reimaging of a Horror classic, I have to applaud his audaciousness for actually exposing how he screwed up a classic in the infamous 4 ? documentary. But seriously, it is interesting to see how a film is made and how frustrating it is to meet deadlines, deal with actors, prop sets you name it. There is a great deal patience and articulation in respect to guiding your actors, script and photography.  The film is certainly not a good remake, more like horrendous but the bonus features can keep you occupied for a bit if your interested in making films.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>This remake of Halloween is one of the best movies in the series. I loved how it gives a very in-depth look into the childhood of Michael Myers and showed the abuse he suffered from his step father and his parents weren't Leave It To Beaver parents like they are portrayed on the original movie. I don't know what there is not to like about this movie. When I watched this movie in theaters, I literally had to check my pulse I was jumping so much. Rob Zombie had a big mountain to climb and he has achieved its height.<br /><br />I thought McDowell was fantastic as Dr. L and was a worthy successor to DP who played the character originally. I also enjoyed all of the cameos of other horror movie icons. Dee Wallace who played Laurie Strode's step mother was on the awesome werewolf movie the Howling and of course Chucky himself, Brad Dourif.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>While everyone else claims that *Friday the 13th* or *Nightmare on Elm Street* is their favorite horror series, mine is *Halloween*.  My favorite is Part II where Michael is trying to kill his sister at the hospital.  Throw in Jamie Lee Curtis, I'm sold!<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />I have to admit that while I've watched Rob Zombie's other movies, none of them have been remarkable for me.  However, this remake of Halloween has certainly gotten my attention.<br /><br />What I love about this remake is that there are background information added to the story.  For example, how Michael came to be this "immortal" serial killer.  Rob Zombie takes us back to Michael's childhood.  It seems that Michael has always been a bad seed, limiting his evil deeds with just mutilating animals.  The monster in him emerges when he reaches a breaking point with his classmates bullying him, his mother always working, the mother's boyfriend constantly picking on him, and his older sister neglecting him for her boyfriend.  Only his innocent baby sister escapes his rage.<br /><br />Years later, we see Michael breaking out of an asylum.  What's freaky is that Michael is this huge guy, about 6'8".  Michael makes those WWF guys look like sissies.  So, can you imagine facing a serial killer with that kind of build?  That's enough to scare the nine lives outta you.  (I know, I know...we're not cats.)<br /><br />Anyways, if you've seen the original in regards to Michael's return to Haddonfield, you'll start to connect the missing pieces that Rob Zombie presents with what you can remember (from John Carpenter's film).  From that point on, the movie becomes entertaining and scary.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>If you're autistic, like I am, you'll probably want to thrill to this documentary which explores the link between autism and mass violence.  You see, Michael Meyers, like most autistics, finds himself lost in a world he never made.  A world populated by frighteningly vulgar and loud neurotypicals who encroach relentlessly, victimizing him until he lashes out with great and fiery vengeance, laying waste to the sordid humanoids around him in a blistering blaze of white heat.  The sister's boyfriend who got put down with an alunimum bat was particularly deserving of this fate, by the way.  Just before getting his head beaten in, you see him fashioning a sandwich from noisesome cold cuts.  He's the type of person who has absolutely no personality whatsoever, apart from a basic sloppiness of demeanor and a shaggy mane of hair that is in the process of fusing into white dreads.  Such a pity his early demise.  The world has lost so very much.<br /><br />Michael then is unjustly incarcerated just for being a freedom fighter.  His mother can't take how great he is, and so she blows her brainz out.  Whatta shame.  So then Michael lays waste to some worthless hillbillies and busts right out of the mental hooskow, leading the resident psychiatrist and stereotypical liberal to bleat "ooohh... oooh!"<br /><br />Flash forward to later that night.  More people need Michael to give them a proper seeing to, which he does, very autistically.  You see, the man behind the mask is the perfect metaphor for autism.  The sense of disconnect and alienation, the sense of needing shelter... add in the fact that the original Meyers mask was adapted from a rubber mask of Captain Kirk (William Shatner interpretation) and we've come full circle.  Stick a knife in this one.  It's well done.  Rob Zombie learned from his mistakes in his first two movies and turned out an excellent movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>While I was watching Rob Zombie's new "Halloween," I was truly amazed by two things: its length and violence. Having seen his films "House of 1000 Corpses" and "The Devil's Rejects," I knew what I was going to see in this revamped version, but I never expected he would spend so much time (more than 30 minutes) to show Michael Myers as a 10-year-old bullied boy (played by Daeg Faerch, who is certainly convincing).<br /><br />I will not write here the details of his family; I only say it is not very pleasant to see, but maybe that is the point. Maybe Rob Zombie is just trying to give Michael a social background, something few people care. I am afraid it only deprives this horror icon of its superhuman presence. Tyler Mane did a very good job as grown-up Michael Myers, but the long introductory part that tried to (sort of) explain him has made the new "Halloween" just another serial killer movie.<br /><br />And this film is very gory. It also has nudities (more than once). Not that I am complaining. Screaming Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) is again chased by Michael Myers, and to his credit Rob Zombie has made each sequence competently, but that is all. What is shown here looks clich&eacute;d, familiar to those who have seen other slasher films, except the unique cast including William Forsythe, Danny Trejo, Bill Moseley, Brad Dourif, Richard Lynch, Dee Wallace, Sid Haig and Sybil Danning. Blink your eyes and you will miss Udo Kier and Clint Howard. (And ex-Monkees Micky Dolenz? Where was he?)<br /><br />I have watched the original "Halloween" long time ago, but I still remember some of the film's scenes were really creepy. But they were not about Michael Myers as killing machine murdering his victims; they were about Michael Myers just standing in the street as if he is something supernatural coming from another world. From the strictly technical viewpoint, Rob Zombie's re-imagined version is decent. It is only that John Carpenter's vision is replaced by Zombie's relentless descriptions of violence, which was seen in his previous films. It was about time to move on.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M1N8G4W4END8.html">A2M1N8G4W4END8</a><br/><p>Rob Zombie's remake of John Carpenter's legendary and classic horror film HALLOWEEN (1978) is absolutely outstanding. Remaining basically loyal to the original and tampering with the basic plot in only minor ways, Zombie's contribution is to provide a back story to the famous serial killer that simultaneously makes him more human and more unnatural...and therefore much scarier!<br /><br />The casting for HALLOWEEN is also pure genius.  While all of the actors fit their roles perfectly and do a convincing job, Malcolm McDowell is especially effective in his brooding and eccentric interpretation of Dr. Samuel Loomis, and Scout Taylor-Compton's portrayal of Laurie Strode almost makes die-hard fans of the original forget that Jamie Lee Curtis originated the role.  In addition, Daeg Faerch is genuinely frightening as the young Michael Myers, and Zombie's wife Sheri Moon Zombie is quite good--arguably one of her best performances to date--as the white-trash mother of young Michael.<br /><br />The DVD set here contains the theatrical version of the film, and thankfully, the disc offers the film in widescreen (a full-screen version is also offered, but why someone would actually want to watch it butchered like that is unfathomable). An Unrated Director's Cut is also available on DVD, but beware--it is far from the same film. Containing more than the usual "restored footage" that had to be cut in order to receive an "R" rating by the MPAA, the Unrated edition actually contains alternate scenes that replace the theatrical ones and, in many ways, make the offering a totally different film. Unfortunately, the alternate scene on the DVD that explains how Michael Myers escapes from the sanitarium is much weaker than the one used in the theatrical version, and it therefore makes the film on that DVD a much weaker flick.<br /><br />Rob Zombie deserves the kudos he's been getting for creating a fantastic new vision with his remake, but if you want to see the work of genius for which he earned that praise, purchase the theatrical release offered here and avoid the Unrated Director's Cut.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H1WNB30JNAWU.html">A2H1WNB30JNAWU</a><br/><p>This remake of Halloween by Rob Zombie actually is a good horror flick.  It made me jump in a couple of scenes.  For all that bad mouth it yes its a remake hollywood sometimes runs out of ideas. Though if you keep an open mind then you might end up liking the movie.  As for myself I enjoy the movie just seem a little long.  I thought maybe should have been maybe an hour and half not the two hours it ended up being.  But I will try seeing the sequal and then make up my mind about whole remakes Zombie is doing.  But if you love your horror movies and have an open mind to possiblity have liking this movie then watch it and see if you end up enjoying it.  Most of my horror movies I have just for the blood and gore not for the plot lines.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Malcolm McDowell stars in Rob Zombie's 2007 horror remake.<br />A doctor hunts an escaped killer stalking his sister and<br />her friends.

I highly recommend<br />this great horror remake.</p></br><a href="../users/ADKA2MJQQCMTO.html">ADKA2MJQQCMTO</a><br/><p>I must have watched this film about three times for no other reason then to decide if I liked it or not.  I was really that on the fence about it.  Final verdict is in and I feel that, although this is admittedly Zombie's best work and there is several kudos to be handed out; ultimately, the film fails.<br /><br />'Halloween' can really be split pretty evenly into two halves.  The first of which is a brand new origin-story for Myers.  Granted, it's a little clich&eacute;d and basically the same white-trash Olympics that Zombie seems to be fixated on.  At the same time though, it's really not bad and I bought into it.  The real standout here is Zombie's real-life wife (Sherri-Moon Zombie) who does a FANTASTIC job of portraying the tragedy of a mother who just can't seem to piece her life back together after Michael snaps.<br /><br />I liked Malcolm McDowell here quite a bit as well.  I've read some pretty heavy criticism of the way he approached the 'Loomis' character, however, I like his approach a little better then (God forgive me for saying this) Donald Pleasance's take.  I always saw Pleasance's 'Loomis' as just some nut that shows up screaming "He's evil!" while shooting a couple of rounds in the air.<br /><br />The real problem is, it's the very existence of this back-story that ultimately betrays the original concept of Myers in the first place.  In the original, and in most of John Carpenter's early films, Carpenter seemed to have a general understanding that nothing was scarier then the fear of the unknown.  In the original 'Halloween' Myers was an unseen terror lurking in the shadows, stalking his victims and biding his time until he decided to strike.  He didn't show even a HINT of emotion or humanity.  Until the audience caught a glimpse of him with his mask off, most people probably weren't even sure he was human.  We didn't know WHAT the motivation was for his rampage.  It was as if "death itself descended on Haddonfield."<br /><br />By explaining too much, in my opinion, Zombie ultimately betrays that concept and demystified what made Michael Myers so cool in the first place.  If you'd made the first half about ANYONE other then the Michael Myers character, it would have worked and been a hundred times better.<br /><br />I thought the second-half of the movie stumbled pretty badly.  While Zombie brought a lot of new material and ideas to the first-half, the second is a flat-out remake of the entire first movie.  At this point, in my opinion, you just can't completely remake a film that's an hour and a half in forty minutes.  It just doesn't work.  You don't have enough time to properly build any momentum, there's no atmosphere created, and absolutely no character development.  Zombie had possibly the best character actor in Hollywood in Brad Douriff and he's almost completely wasted as the film screams along at the pace of a runaway truck.  What was originally a world-class thriller is warped into an action movie, and like the first part, it just doesn't work.<br /><br />If Zombie wanted to do an origin that was completely new, he should have stuck with it.  On the other hand, if he wanted to do a shot-by-shot remake in the vein of Psycho, he should have stuck with THAT concept.  What you absolutely CAN'T do is both, which is exactly what we have here.<br /><br />While I'm willing to admit that it was a good swing; regrettably in the end, it just doesn't work.</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>When it was announced last year that rocker-turned-director Rob Zombie would be helming a remake of John Carpenter's "Halloween," it was met with mixed reactions. Some balked at the idea of remaking such a vital and iconic movie, while others were anxious to see what such a unique character as Rob could do with the material. Count me in the latter. It helps being a fan of his music from the beginning, but also take into consideration how poor the past few "Halloween" movies have been. If anyone were to remake it, could it turn out any better than Rob Zombie's? Even after watching it twice, and both times being frustrated with it's lack of focus, I still say the answer to that question is most certainly "no."<br /><br />We all know the story of the Boogeyman, The Shape, or quite simply, Michael Myers. So to do a shot-for-shot remake (ala "Psycho") or anything of the like would be silly. Which is exactly where the trouble with this movie lies. "Halloween 2007," as I will refer to it from here-on-out, plays like two very different movies fused together. First, we have Rob's vision. A Michael Myers with a story. He might not be given much motivation, but what Rob gives us in the first half is not only intriguing and disturbing, but actually refreshing when compared to the sequels. This is where he truly makes his mark and reinvents Michael Myers as we know him. About 45 minutes into the movie, however, it takes a turn. From out of nowhere, Rob starts rushing into a lazy remake of the original movie's events. We are introduced to Laurie Strode, this time played by fresh-faced Scout Taylor-Compton, along with Annie (played by Danielle Harris, making a bold return to the series) and Linda (Kristina Klebe). The three girls spout off lines from the original in such an off-handed way that you feel like you're watching an amateur film-maker fresh out of his first high school film-making class. To say the dialogue is terrible would be an understatement: it cripples the second half of the second movie completely! Virtually nothing in the second half of the film is effective. The kids are routinely dispatched in such a careless way. Some characters die after only being in the movie for a matter of moments. There is no character development for the second half, so it's hard to feel any tension. It was nice to see Rob recreate some memorable moments in his own way, and Danielle Harris has some truly unforgettable moments with Michael, but other than that, it's a dud, and as someone who awaited this movie with baited breath (a big "Halloween" nut and Rob Zombie fan, mind you), I found myself yawning from time to time in the last half. And let's not even get into it's dud of an ending. Had Rob Zombie stuck with what he had established in the first half and forgotten about paying tribute to the original movie (or whatever he was trying to do) in the second half, the results could have been much, much better.<br /><br />On a more positive note, it sports an impressive cast. Not only is it satisfying to see Danielle Harris once again facing Michael Myers, but Malcolm McDowell ("A Clockwork Orange") is about the best they could have done to replace Donald Pleasence and Sam Loomis. Brad "Chucky" Dourif, as Sheriff Brackett, is spot on, but unfortunately gets very little time. Just about everyone involved in "The Devil's Rejects" gets a part, from Bill Moseley, William Forsythe, Ken Foree, Sid Haig and Sheri Moon Zombie, who takes advantage of her role as Michael's mom and surprisingly goes against the stereotype she has been built up to. Danny Trejo, however, was the biggest surprise, and his parts with Michael are those that work best. His fate serves as the best example of Michael's lack of reason or mercy, and truly makes him a horror villian to be reckoned with and may be enough to send chills down the spines of even the biggest horror fans. Daeg Faerch, who plays a young Michael Myers, is also a nice surprise, as kids in horror movies can tend to be annoying. Yet, he turns in a very creepy and very believeable performance of a very disturbed young boy.<br /><br />The movie, on the whole, looks gorgeous. Rob obviously knows his stuff, but the major problem is in the script. At times, the movie feels incomplete, and at others, it feels like he is making it up as he goes along. It goes without saying that the original didn't need to be remade, as it is still effective to this day, so if a "re-telling" was neccessary, why didn't Rob make it his own? Like "Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers," you can literally smell the studio interference here. The movie not only makes little sense, but feels incomplete and rushed. What starts off as an intriguing and refreshing take on a well-known character, eventually degrades itself into boring drivel. It's painful to say it, but Rob's vision of "Halloween" hardly pans out any better than the dismal "H20" or "Resurrection." Even those watching who don't know the original should sense that something is wrong here. It's like Rob Zombie either didn't have the confidence to make this his own, or didn't really want to make the film in the first place.</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>This is a remake of one of, if not thee most succesfull independant films of all time.

His stepfather Ronnie (William Forsythe) is a drunk redneck who kind of abuses the young boy, he has a sexy stripper mother Debroah (Sherri Moon Zombie), a stepsister named Judith (Hanna Hall) and a baby sister named Laurie. He has gotten into rotten and horrific behaviors including killing animals and even killed a few school bullies that picked on him, he did however murdered his big sister with her boyfriend and Ronnie creating one of Haddonfield's most brutal crimes ever. He is convicted guilty of murder in the first degree and is under psychiatric care with daily care from child psychologist Dr. Sam Loomis (Michael Mcdowell), years later as he has grown up as a hulking mute man (Tyler Mane) Michael hides his face in various masks. He escapes from the mental ward to find his long lost little sister Laurie Strode (Scout-Taylor Compton) as he kills people in his way for now Dr. Loomis must try to stop him from killing anyone.<br /><br />Enjoyable revamp of the Halloween franchise that started with the 1978 slasher landmark from John Carpenter. Fans cried blasphemy when they heard this was gonna be remade but Rob Zombie who is a hardcore fan of the original and whom helmed the underrated "House of 1000 Corpses" and the brilliant "Devil's Rejects" went to save the franchise after it became a joke of itself no thanks to "Halloween Resurrection" with Busta Rhymes ruining the film. Although he had no intention to make a full remake like the horrible "Psycho" remake from 1998 he wanted to make a prequel and a reinvention of the original movie that honors John Carpenter's masterpiece. The film does co-star Ken Foree, Sid Haig, Brad Douriff, Bill Moseley, Danny Trejo, Danielle Harris, Dee Wallace Stone, Clint Howard, Udo Kier, and Sybil Danning as this film does give an interesting extended history of Michael Myers and how he had a dysfunctional family. I know some fans of the original Halloween are kind of disgusted with the new Myers being a "Married with Children" kind of trashy family. There is some brutal gory violence making this the goriest Halloween movie since "Halloween 2" in 1981, though it does miss out on the original bloodless scares that made the original movie a classic this one goes for bloody action like some of the Halloween sequels. Though it is very entertaining but can never replace the original classic as that was not the intention that Rob Zombie did for he just wanted to re-establish the franchise.<br /><br />This 2-Disc collector's Edition blu-ray offers stunning picture and sound with the unrated director's cut of the film with more character development and violence that were cut out to avoid an NC-17 rating. The extras include Audio commentary, a 2 hour documentary that goes behind the scenes of this reimagining, featurettes, deleted scenes and alternate ending with select commentary, Screen tests, interviews, BD-Live and Trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I49HL6XR62DI.html">A3I49HL6XR62DI</a><br/><p>This is not Rob Zombie's best film. That honor goes to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AXWHSA">The Devil's Rejects (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>, Zombie's visceral, shocking and funny tribute to B-movie gorefests. Halloween is an extremely weak re-make of John Carpenter's masterpiece, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009UW0N">Halloween (Divimax 25th Anniversary Edition)</a>. The most innovative and creative part of Zombie's film is the first hour where he explores the birth of a serial killer. Zombie's extraordinary depiction of Michael's life in a hellish home where domestic violence is the norm and sexually explicit language abounds is so well done. The young actor who portrays Michael is perfect. Sherri Moon Zombie plays Michael's mother quite well and even throws in a pole dance for good measure. Michael's life in a mental institution is also extremely well done, culminating in a bloody murder spree as he escapes. One wishes Zombie had stopped there and called the film: "Halloween: The Beginning". Unfortunately,the last 45 minutes of the film consists of an extremely weak and hurried remake of Carpenter's original film. Laurie Stode, Michael's sister, is so annoying that you will want to kill her yourself. She wines and screams all the time and it's merciful when Michael kills her equally annoying friends. The last 20 mintues of this bloody mess are pure agony -- a confusing mishmash of mayhem as Michael knocks holes in an attic, trying to pry Laurie out. So dumb. I must, however, compliment Malcom McDowell on his performance as Dr. Loomis. He brings dignity to a role that was owned by Donald Pleasance. An odd and annoying thing about this film is the confusion about the time in which it is set. The musical soundtrack is late 70's, but people are using cell phones. Guys have long hair, but girls are wearing clothes that appear to be at least 90's stuff. Just makes your head want to explode. Runtime is about 1 hour and 45 minutes. Way too long and absolutely exhausting. Trust me, the original and most of its sequels are better ways to spend your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UX5ABICURKL5.html">A2UX5ABICURKL5</a><br/><p>When you make a remake of a movie it should come close to the original story.<br />For me it took to much of a left turn, it had no feel like the original Halloween.<br />It seems that people that make movies think movie goers like to listen to bad language, I thought that's what made the original Halloween unique is that there wasn't much bad language in it.<br />It's cool that ROB gave us a insight on how Michael became a serial killer, and the guy playing Michael is a giant.<br />This movie reminds me more of "Friday the 13th" or "The Texas chainsaw massacre".<br />Just to let you know now this movie has quite a few sex sense in it.<br />Don't!! start watching this movie thinking it's like the original Halloween.<br />I rate this DVD a 3 of 5 stars!!</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Being a major fan of the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1564428117">Halloween [VHS</a>] (1978), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304288433">Halloween 2 [VHS</a>] (1981), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305531374">Halloween H2O</a> (1998), of course, I had to go to the movie theater to see this remake, Rob Zombie's Halloween (2007).<br />  I was a teenager when the first Halloween (starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence) was out and about, now I'm a mature man with a grown daughter, but I still enjoy the scare of a good horror film.<br />  I have seen all of the other 8 "Halloween" films, but this Rob Zombie's Halloween had constant cursing that disenchanted me and I found the first act and second act less suspenseful than the original John Carpenter's "Halloween".<br />  This 2007 version does give you insight to why Michael Myers killed as a child.  In this version, 10-year old Michael's (Daeg Faerch) home life is not the best. His mother, Deborah (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a stripper and the house appears to be unkept. Her boyfriend, Ronnie, (William Forsythe) lives in the house and argues and shows no respect towards 10-year old Michael (Daeg Faerch).<br />  In the original 1978 version, the two-story house was so immaculate, the parents were older and of middle class.<br />  Dare I say, this 2007 film does reflect the way some young people are today and we know of the dysfunctional parents in this day and age too. It makes this film all the more difficult to watch.<br />  When young Michael becomes maniac due to the kids bothering him in school and the abusive nature of his mother's boyfriend, Michael kills his school enemy Wesley (Daryl Sabara), Ronnie, Judith, his own sister (Hanna R. Hall) and her boyfriend, Steve (Adam Weisman). he leaves his baby sister, Laurie Strode, alive.<br />  Laurie Strode as a teenager is played by Scout Taylor-Compton, now in the role made famous by Jamie Lee Curtis in the original "Halloween" movies.<br />  This film does not overshadow the cinematography and direction of John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), which is still the best scare and suspense of any Halloween film.<br />  While Rob Zombie's adult "Michael Myers" is more giant, grisly and brutal (played by Tyler Mane), Zombie did open my eyes and made a very daring motion in the final act.<br />  We all know of the chilling ending in the original Halloween (1978), but director/writer Rob Zombie went even further and beyond this point for 15 more minutes. The climax that Rob Zombie added to his ending was very new, fresh and so suspenseful, I was on the edge of my seat.  The last 15 minutes surprised me and the last minute twist was fantastic. It left you wanting more.<br />  Of all the "Halloween" films, only Danielle Harris, from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FA57UI">Halloween 4 - The Return of Michael Myers (Divimax Edition)</a> (1988), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FA57US">Halloween 5 - The Revenge of Michael Myers (Divimax Edition)</a> (1989), makes an appearance in this 2007 film as a different character "Annie Brackett".<br /><br />  Also in the film:<br />  Leslie Easterbrook, Sid Haig, Brad Dourif, Udo Kier, Skyler Gisomdo, Sybil Danning.<br />  Danny Trejo (Runaway train (1985), Death Wish 4: The Crackdown (1987), Grindhouse (2007)/Grindhouse (2007), Machete (2010).<br />  Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead 1978,2004).<br />  Dee Wallace (The Howling 1981, E.T.

We get to see what turns him into the soulless monster that is Michael Myers! In this remake Michael is absolutely horrifying and he is unrelenting. Great job by Rob for not destroying this.</p></br><a href="../users/ADKA2MJQQCMTO.html">ADKA2MJQQCMTO</a><br/><p>I must have watched this film about three times for no other reason then to decide if I liked it or not.  I was really that on the fence about it.  Final verdict is in and I feel that, although this is admittedly Zombie's best work and there is several kudos to be handed out; ultimately, the film fails.<br /><br />'Halloween' can really be split pretty evenly into two halves.  The first of which is a brand new origin-story for Myers.  Granted, it's a little clich&eacute;d and basically the same white-trash Olympics that Zombie seems to be fixated on.  At the same time though, it's really not bad and I bought into it.  The real standout here is Zombie's real-life wife (Sherri-Moon Zombie) who does a FANTASTIC job of portraying the tragedy of a mother who just can't seem to piece her life back together after Michael snaps.<br /><br />I liked Malcolm McDowell here quite a bit as well.  I've read some pretty heavy criticism of the way he approached the 'Loomis' character, however, I like his approach a little better then (God forgive me for saying this) Donald Pleasance's take.  I always saw Pleasance's 'Loomis' as just some nut that shows up screaming "He's evil!" while shooting a couple of rounds in the air.<br /><br />The real problem is, it's the very existence of this back-story that ultimately betrays the original concept of Myers in the first place.  In the original, and in most of John Carpenter's early films, Carpenter seemed to have a general understanding that nothing was scarier then the fear of the unknown.  In the original 'Halloween' Myers was an unseen terror lurking in the shadows, stalking his victims and biding his time until he decided to strike.  He didn't show even a HINT of emotion or humanity.  Until the audience caught a glimpse of him with his mask off, most people probably weren't even sure he was human.  We didn't know WHAT the motivation was for his rampage.  It was as if "death itself descended on Haddonfield."<br /><br />By explaining too much, in my opinion, Zombie ultimately betrays that concept and demystified what made Michael Myers so cool in the first place.  If you'd made the first half about ANYONE other then the Michael Myers character, it would have worked and been a hundred times better.<br /><br />I thought the second-half of the movie stumbled pretty badly.  While Zombie brought a lot of new material and ideas to the first-half, the second is a flat-out remake of the entire first movie.  At this point, in my opinion, you just can't completely remake a film that's an hour and a half in forty minutes.  It just doesn't work.  You don't have enough time to properly build any momentum, there's no atmosphere created, and absolutely no character development.  Zombie had possibly the best character actor in Hollywood in Brad Douriff and he's almost completely wasted as the film screams along at the pace of a runaway truck.  What was originally a world-class thriller is warped into an action movie, and like the first part, it just doesn't work.<br /><br />If Zombie wanted to do an origin that was completely new, he should have stuck with it.  On the other hand, if he wanted to do a shot-by-shot remake in the vein of Psycho, he should have stuck with THAT concept.  What you absolutely CAN'T do is both, which is exactly what we have here.<br /><br />While I'm willing to admit that it was a good swing; regrettably in the end, it doesn't work.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>The only thing I can say for this movie is that at least it isn't another SEQUEL to the "Halloween" series: the last one with Busta Rhymes was so atrociously bad that I wondered to myself if John Carpenter regretted making the original in the first place.  Also, Zombie has some creepy<br />scenes with respect to the budding superhuman psychopath who goes by the name of Michael Myers: Loomis' black and white tapes (Malcolm McDowell is completely wasted in this role) where a young Myers wears demented masks, descending further and further into psychosis and rage.  That's about the only chill you're gonna find in this movie.<br /><br />The rest is just typical Rob Zombie fare.  Young women bruised and bloody, screaming in pain, sociopathic trailer trash descending further and further into hopelessness, and scene after scene of depraved brutality for brutality's sake.<br /><br />You almost get the feeling that Zombie is parodying the original: Malcolm McDowell actually hosts a college lecture on guess what, folks? "The Devil's Eyes"!  Would that have anything to do with the lines Donald Pleasance rasped (effectively) about Myers' in the first film?  And hey, Brad Dourif is the sherrif!  Otis is the graveyard keeper for Haddonfield!<br />Udo Keir is in the movie for about five seconds!  Wow!<br /><br />Oh, and we get treated to about fifteen minutes of a young Michael killing some mice.  Thanks, Rob.<br /><br />That disturbing, unnameable, mysterious atmosphere in the original is replaced by mere slasher fare.  I have to admit that I really don't get what people are out to get with respect to Zombie as a filmmaker.  All he does is imitate classic grindhouse flicks of the 70's to very little effect.  The only redeeming quality I can find in any of his work is perhaps the increase in hygiene around the country: I've felt compelled to take a shower after watching a couple of his movies.<br /><br />Buy the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>Rob Zombie has made a career of all things horror. From the musical group White Zombie to his own solo career, in comics with his monster fighting character El Superbeasto and into films. His first two forays, HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES and THE DEVIL'S REJECTS tied into one another nicely with the second film being a sequel to the first. But with his third film, HALLOWEEN, Zombie falls short of offering not only scares but signs of a developmental director.<br /><br />Everyone already knows the tale of Michael Myers, the psychopath from Haddonfield, IL, who murdered his sister only to be committed to an institution he would later escape from with the intent of more killings back home years later. While that is the basis for Zombie's film, it is not a remake but more of a retelling, a reinvention of the same character.<br /><br />Here we are offered young Michael and the household he grows up in that forms his life. Michael's mother (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a stripper, saddled with a new husband (William Forsythe) who is disabled and a neer do well more interested in yelling at the kids than in offering any sort of role model. Michael's sister is a trashy sleep with anyone teen who dresses provocatively and does little else. All of this is not lost on Michael who spends his time killing his pets and taking photos of them. What we are being offered is a textbook glimpse as to why a youngster becomes a serial killer. The nice middle class family shown in the original is tossed aside for this new group. And in this first portion of the film, the problems Zombie has are apparent.<br /><br />Zombie has filled three films now with the same characters. Sure, they may have different names and different small time characteristics, but the fact remains that he focuses on the dysfunctional family and their housecleaning inabilities. Yes, it seems that all families in Zombie's world can't clean to save themselves. Not only that but they all have the same dingy look to their living quarters as well as references to pop culture. The house Michael grows up in could be a home that the Firefly family would feel comfortable in. It all looks the same and that detracts greatly from the viewing experience, unless of course you'd never seen another Rob Zombie film.<br /><br />Comparisons to the original film are inevitable and this will most likely be the downfall of the film in the long run. Michael goes overboard with his murderous rampage as a child in this film unlike the original. Where no blood was seen in that film, it flows freely now. Perhaps this is due to the changing times, but it adds nothing to the scares of the film or the character. It does make him a more brutal killer, leaving him one without a touch of sympathy. But the mindless killer from the original is replaced by someone we feel absolutely nothing for now.<br /><br />Once finished with the whole back story of young Michael, his family and the kindly Dr. Loomis (Michael McDowell) who takes care of him at the institution, we move forward 15 years to when Michael escapes and heads back home. The body count increases once more as he kills everyone he comes into contact with their, including a worker who had befriended him. Once out, the story becomes more familiar, almost a duplicate of the original shot from different angles, with different actors and focusing less on the character of Laurie Strode, the central character in John Carpenter's version.<br /><br />Laurie and her friends are nothing more than meat to be slaughtered by Michael in this one. There is no development of character, no reason for us to think of them as more than teens in peril that we have seen in hundreds of other slasher flicks. While we cared about the original teens, this time around they seem less human and placed in our way for two reasons: to be killed by Michael and to offer more exposed flesh than the first.<br /><br />By the film's end we are offered the traditional sliced and diced teens, gratuitous nudity and enough blood to make a special effects company weep for joy at the size of their bill. But we have gained nothing in the iconography that is Michael Myers. While we are given more background on him, we care less about him than we ever did.<br /><br />Worst of all is the fact that Rob Zombie, a director that showed such great potential before, seems to be telling us after only three films that this is all he has to offer. Stories told from the same world, a world that blasts apart the whole FATHER KNOWS BEST world we would all like it to be. In his world, there is no caring parent. And when they are caring, they are twisted in some revolting way.<br /><br />I haven't given up on Zombie yet though. Having recently signed a two picture deal with the Weinstein's, perhaps he will show us he has more tricks up his sleeve than he let on. But if he returns to the carnie soiled world he's offered in three films to date, then it looks as though he's a one note director. Let's hope he offers us more. It's in there somewhere.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BQBLCKJHP65G.html">A2BQBLCKJHP65G</a><br/><p>What can I say, this update disapointed me. While the introduction and history of the pre-teen Michael Myers was nice as a prequel of sorts, the almost word-for-word remake of that fateful Halloween night fifteen years when "He" came home lacked the same spark as the first time around. Each new actor seemed to turn in a murder-by-numbers approach with the established characters, and the movie's new ending really paled in comparision to the 1978 original. While to any fan of the Halloween franchise should see this at least once, it will definitely NOT replace your yearly viewings of the original. If only Rob Zombie concentrated on making a prequel only instead of this watered down attempt to lure a new generation of audiences, this could have been a little more satifiying.<br /><br />While I'm here, let me let others in on what exactly is on that Circuit City exclusive bonus third disc. First off, it's in a paper sleeve (not part of the original packaging), that has only one extra feature, a 20 minute discussion with Rob Zombie & three other cast members at Comic-Con 2007. In fact, it doesn't even have a menu, just plop in the disc and it begins. I was wondering why this wasn't just put on the 2 disc as maybe an easter egg or something, it should have fit in the space nicely. Oh, and concerning that regular's second disc....if you missed Malcolm McDowell's personality from "A Clockwork Orange" after he made that film, check out the 10 minutes of Bloopers with him, he's a riot, almost as if this film brought out the lost "Alex De Large" outta him again. It's just too bad it didn't show during the actual movie.<br /><br />Overall, the extra features were more entertaining than the movie. A movie that didn't need to be remade, but worth one look as to see why not.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Halloween directed and written and directed by Rob Zombie (of all people!) is a terrible remake of the 1978 classic. It's a new take on Halloween, the characters have more of a back story and jeez there's a lot of blood and nudity in this one, this film doesn't work at all. The dialogue is cheesy and lame as hell, Zombie isn't a literary god not even a little. The acting is embarrassing, I can't believe Zombie couldn't find any decent actors and of course he put his real-life wife in this as Michael Myers mother, she plays a stripper! Thank god I have the original to fall back on, this remake was a complete waste of time!</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>As a die-hard fan of Carpenter's classic, I was incredibly dissapointed & angry at this lame, trashy remake.<br /><br />The problem with this "Halloween" is:<br /><br />1. Zombie needs to stop, & I mean stop, casting his films with entire casts from his previous films. The entire cast from "Devil's Rejects" is here & it was really annoying. He also needs to bring his films into the present. Enough with the white trash 70's.<br /><br />2. The film spends way, way too much time in Michael's youth. He kills his sister - we know this going into the picture, since we're versed in Carpenter's original. This makes the movie sag like William Forsythe's stomach. Putting a human face on Michael Myers was also a big mistake.<br /><br /> In the original, the grown up Michael was known as "The Shape", for the simple reason being, is that behind that mask was the simple definition of pure evil incarnate. In Zombie's remake, basically, Myers turns out to be just another a-hole gone psychotic from a byproduct of white trash American society. Get him a job at the local post office & he would fit right in.<br /><br />3. The timeline in this film is totally f***ed. I can only assume that the beginning of this film starts on Halloween of 1978, since little Mikey is listening to "God Of Thunder", has a Kiss t-shirt on, & the entire atmosphere looks like, at least, poor whitetrash mid-seventies. So add 15 years to 1978 add at least 2 or 3 more for good measure & you still come up to 1995, 96 at best. Thats all well & good until Lynda tries to make a call on her cell phone, topless, in the Myers house.<br /><br />4. Tyler Mane as Michael Myers. I really had no problem with this until he first shows up in his cell in a bathrobe & slippers. Its gets worse as he turns around with an orange mask on his face that reminded me of the WWE's Kane. I was waiting for the Undertaker to show up for god's sake! "Rest in Peace"? You bet.<br /><br />5. Michael actually catches Laurie - & doesn't kill her. What!?!? That's like Wyle E. Coyote catching The Road Runner, turning to the audience, & saying, "What do I do now?"<br /><br />6. The score. Not here it isn't. Carpenter's haunting opening theme is used in Zombie's film 4 times at best & at all the wrong times. Zombie uses old school 70's tunes during different scenes. Not bad, but this is "Halloween" not "High School Musical".<br /><br />7. Its not scary. It's almost like watching an epiosde of A&E's "Cold Case File" or "American Justice". Zombie doesn't really set any tone or atmosphere for the film. Its just one set piece after another.<br /><br />8. The ending. Absolute bull***t.<br /><br />Stick with Carpenter's eternal classic, because next Halloween this remake will be forgotten, like last years autumn leaves.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Rob Zombie has done a very good job in remaking one of horror's most classic films.  Seldom do remakes live up to the original, but this scary film comes very close and adds in some extras along the way.<br /><br />Unlike the original Halloween, Zombie's version starts out with the entire Myers family.  Young Michael (Daeg Faerch) is constantly tormented by other children at school.  They make fun of his stripper mom Deborah Myers (Sheri Moon Zombie) and his promiscuous sister. Deborah's slob of a boyfriend Ronnie White (William Forsythe) spends his days lying on the couch and hurling insults at the rest of the family.  The only person that Michael is somewhat close to is his baby sister.<br /><br />One day, the tormenting from the other children goes too far, and Michael snaps.  One child is killed, and Michael then kills his sister, her boyfriend, and Ronnie on Halloween night.  His mother finds him holding his baby sister on the steps outside the house.<br /><br />Michael is put on trial, found guilty, and sentenced to a mental hospital.  At the hospital, Michael is placed under the care of Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell).  At first, Dr. Loomis sees Michael as a troubled child who has no recollection of what he has done.  He longs to go home to be with his mother.  But, as time passes, Michael slips deeper and deeper into a shell.  He begins wearing masks constantly and soon, he snaps again.  More people are killed, Michael escapes, and he heads back to Haddonfield to claim his last victim; his young sister Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton), who was adopted after Michael's earlier killing spree.<br /><br />The events after this point unfold pretty much the same as they did in John Carpenter's original Halloween.  There are some subtle differences but, for the most part, Zombie follows the original very closely until the end, which is very different from the original.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Carpenter's Halloween movies, and I was anxious to see how this version compared to the earlier ones.  I was very impressed with Zombie's film.  What I liked most about this movie was the look into Michael Myers' early life and how he became the madman he turned out to be.  Unlike the beginning of Carpenter's film, where the viewer only sees Michael killing his sister, Zombie spends almost an hour of film time setting the stage for Michael's slide from a troubled child to maniacal killer.  He also makes the viewer feel somewhat sympathetic for Michael, due to his troubled upbringing by a mom who works as a stripper and a deadbeat boyfriend.<br /><br />I recommend this movie very highly.  Rob Zombie has taken a classic horror film and reworked it in such a way as to make it almost better than the original.  I still prefer Carpenter's version over Zombie's, but this scary movie is definitely worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>In honor of writing my demonic-numbered review, I thought I'd pick one of my favorites! I love Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN! It was everything I hoped it would be and more. I saw this the first day it came out. I couldn't possibly wait another day. I loved the beginning showing Michael, his mom; Deborah, Judith, baby Laurie, and Deborah's boyfriend; Ronnie White. I loved how we meet Dr. Loomis. I love the scenes at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. I love how Michael breaks out. (NOT the unrated version of how he breaks out!) I love how Michael gets his clothes from Big Joe Grizzley. I love when they show Michael putting his infamous mask on and they play the HALLOWEEN music! I love it when Laurie finally meets Michael at the Wallace house, I loved it when Dr. Loomis tries to kill Michael. I especially loved the ending. To me, Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN is just as good as John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN! I highly recommend this film to all HALLOWEEN fans!<br /><br />HALLOWEEN begins in Haddonfield, Illinois on October 31st in the morning. Michael is 'playing' with his rat. We see how it is in his house with the white-trash Ronnie White, his mom and sister. During school, he gets in a fight and Dr. Loomis sees that he is at the early stage of becoming a psychopath. On HALLOWEEN night while Deborah Myers is at the Rabbit In Red Lounge stripping, Michael kills Judith, her boyfriend, and Ronnie. He is transferred to Smith's Grove Sanitarium. During his years there, Dr. Loomis tries to help him, but he gets a lot worse, and I really feel sorry for Deborah when she realizes what a monster her son has become. 15 years later, Michael escapes and goes back to Haddonfield on HALLOWEEN. Throughout the day, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, and Lynda see Michael stalking them. When Laurie babysits Tommy Doyle, Annie makes Laurie watch Lindsey Wallace also. While Annie and her boyfriend, Paul are having sex, Michael strikes again, and waits for Laurie. Laurie finds Annie bloody, so she calls the police. Sheriff Brackett and Dr. Loomis hurry to the rescue, but Michael has already captured Laurie and taken her back to the Myers house. Will Laurie escape? Will Dr. Loomis find her in time?

But, I very surprized to see that Rob Zombie did a very well job of remaking the film. Zombie even attempted to take it a step further with trying offer an explaination as what made Myers into the monster known as "the Shape". What even made the film more interesting, was that for the first time. Halloween fans got a chance to hear Myers actually speak. The acting was very good for this time. Especially, that boy who played the younger Myers. He did an excellent job.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Michael Myers (Faerch) is a kid destined for trouble.  His mom (Zombie) and her boyfriend (Forsythe) are terrible parent figures.  Pushed to the brink, he eventually snaps.  One Halloween, he dons a mask and attacks a school bully.  Then he heads home to kill his family.  The only survivors are his mother and infant sister Laurie.  Michael is committed to Smith's Grove Sanitarium under the care of Dr. Sam Loomis (McDowell).  Loomis eventually realizes he is dealing with pure evil in Michael.  Fifteen years later, on Halloween, Michael (Man) escapes from the sanitarium and heads home to Haddonfield to find his sister, and finish the job he started years before.<br /><br />"Halloween" does some things really well, and some things really poorly.  The result is an average movie that in no way eclipses the original.  The good includes Tyler Mane as the grown up Michael.  Finally played by an actual actor, Michael is menacing and really scary.  It's also nice to see familiar scenes from the original.  That, along with the original's music makes the film feel close to the original at times.  Unfortunately, with 45 minutes devoted to backstory that took about 10 minutes in the original, the meat of the story feels compressed and rushed.  There is no building up to the final showdown.  It feels like the movie is one continuous murder after the other.  Lastly, the ending is terrible, without any of the creepiness of the original.  Yes, it has been changed, and not for the better.  Rob Zombie's "Halloween" is an interesting take on the original, but is deeply flawed.  If you want to see a great "Halloween", go rent the original directed by John Carpenter.</p></br><a href="../users/AZQ7O73EAS3VI.html">AZQ7O73EAS3VI</a><br/><p>Typical horror movie, where the bad guy never falls. But still, Rob did a good job with this. Good thrills here and there. Ill warn you now, avoid the sequel. Its TERRIBLE</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>Rob Zombie's Halloween now if this was a stand alone movie it could've been half way watchable. It stars Scout Taylour Compton as Laurie Strode Malcom McDowell as Dr. Loomis Sheri Moon Zombie is in this for the sake of being Rob's wife Daeg Fearch plays young Michael Myers Tyler Mane plays adult Michael Myers Danielle Harris make plays Annie Brad Douriff plays Lee Brackett. The story is young Michael Myers grows up in your cliche Rob Zombie white trash family who is abused by his step father & you get the F  in every sentence don't tell me I use language cause this is Rob Zombie writing this & he is a terrible writer he can't make good dialog. We learn Michael likes to kill animals I hear "Oh it's realism" those kinds of plots have been done over & over. They work for The Hannibal films not Halloween. So no it's not original it's cliche. Ok Michael is bullied at school Michael kills him in the woods he moves on to his sister & step father & becuse his sister won't take him trick or treating & you get love hurts a scene that I laughed at it is corny. I know it's Rob Zombie's Halloween but G*d D**n Michael isn't suppose to be a tragic character. He's doing it to protect his younger sister. By this point the mystery is gone we get pointless sessions between Michael Myers & Loomis then there's this scene that made me laugh Dr. Loomis & Michael's Mom leave the room & this Nurse looks at a picture & says "Pretty baby couldn't be related to you." she turns her back & you might as well as had a sign that said victim. Michael goes from average sized kid to almost 7 foot. Michael's escape is so retarted in the unrated version & this was suppose to be "realistic." Were introduced to Laurie Strode & her annoying friends Scout Taylor Compton has the acting ability of a porn star. After that we get a shorter poorer made version of the original. Michael is like Jason & not like The Shape  Tyler Mane has 2 maybe 3 ok scenes but he'd be a better Jason. Like I said stand alone movie it's maybe half way watchable but since Rob wanted the money he went & remade Halloween. Just becuse Michael is HUGH it's got a lot of blood I can watch Halloween II the good 1 & it's a lot better. If written right anybody can play Michael Myers but Rob Zombie can't write. & no this is not better than JC Halloween. I'd rather watch Halloween Resurrection it knew what it wanted to be it was ment to be funny this was trying to be serious & came off as laughable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A69DJ2KPU4CH.html">A1A69DJ2KPU4CH</a><br/><p>If you're going to remake a classic horror movie such as Psycho, Friday the 13th, When a Stranger Calls, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Amityville Horror, or Halloween you better be a masterful director, and you better have a new, unique, and interesting way of presenting the material. Unfortunately all of the Hollywood horror remakes of the past 10 or so years have failed miserably in all regards. Halloween is no different.<br /><br />Rob Zombie tried to add a unique twist by delving into Michael's childhood and what might have contributed to creating the monster he became, but it's so cliched and trite as to not matter. Boy grows up with abusive step father and his mother is a stripper with a heart of gold. This abusive environment leads to a boy who kills animals for fun and then moves on to humans. Yawn... Give me a break. In the original we didn't need to know about Michael's upbringing because it's very clearly stated he was born evil. It's the whole nature vs nurture debate and Rob Zombie takes the nurture route to ill effect.<br /><br />Rob Zombie also seems to have a fascination with white trash and excessive vulgarity. I don't know, maybe Zombie think dropping an F-bomb every few minutes adds authenticity to the script. Another fail!<br /><br />This remake is boring, lacks suspense, does not illicit a single moment of fear, and does not have a single character you care about. The original had all of that. Add this to the long list of Hollywood horror remakes that had no business being remade and are as forgettable as a fart in the wind (and smell as bad).</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>The opening of the film is clever and deals with the events leading up to Michael's first murder. I was very happy with the back story of Michael Myers & how brutal his life was & you could almost see day by day how he was driven to kill almost his entire family.<br /><br />Minor details that were simply Rob Zombie's way of putting his mark on the film include a white trash family that Michael allegedly comes from (even though in the original his mother and father seem to be pretty straight-laced, almost nerdy, people) and the fact that his mother is a stripper. Dr. Loomis is introduced early on, in the film, at Michael's school after some questionable things he done. I just feel that there was enough of a set up in the original John Carpenter film for Zombie to build off of, without going and adding the trashy nature of Michael's family and sympathy we are supposed to feel for him. On top of that it was great to see inside Smith Grove as well - Dr Loomis was far better in this version - although the original is a classic this version had a lot more depth & rather intense ending.<br /><br />Now, even though the film begins in 1963 and then flashes forward 15 years to the night Michael escapes and returns to Haddonfield. Why, then, do the characters have cell phones and are there 1993 Ford Mustangs along the streets of Haddonfield? To me, this just makes the film seem sloppy and badly imagined. If you are going to take the time to "re-imagine" a film that is as iconic and famous as Halloween, these should be obvious things to deal with.<br /><br />The "chase" scenes are well staged and Zombie throws in some decent scenarios not found in the original. The climax is an entertaining combination of classic 80's style horror where you are screaming at the female lead for being so dense and modern horror grisliness where you feel sick to your stomach after enduring it.<br /><br />This film did go well with me and my biggest complaint, however, is with the sloppiness of the time difference in events. Aside from that Zombie's "Halloween" is a calculated gamble to add to these sequels, and it does pay off in the end, "Halloween" is perfectly watchable for any horror buffs so if you haven't seen it yet take the time to see it this month.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>The writing was on the wall. The past twenty years have seen remakes of such beloved horror classics like "Night of the Living Dead," "Dawn of the Dead," "The Omen," and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"; because of that, I guess the idea of remaking John Carpenter's "Halloween" was not so far fetched, after all. Of course, that got everyone wondering: Can this new version in any way, shape, or form live up to expectations? Having seen it, I can say without a doubt that the answer is yes. Quite frankly, this is one of the best horror remakes I've ever seen, updating the original story into a dark, gritty, and stylistic fright fest. As far as remakes are concerned, I'd say that this is in the same league as John Carpenter's "The Thing" or Marcus Nispel's "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."<br /><br />Taking the reigns from Carpenter is Rob Zombie, who's first movie--"House of 1,000 Corpses"--gave the horror genre a rejuvenating boost. While the film itself was unfocused and derivative, it's style was eye catching; watching it, I knew that, if given the right material, Zombie would be the skillful horror filmmaker he set out to be. He's lived up to that potential with "Halloween," a film that does a masterful job of updating--but not rehashing--the original 1978 film. Carpenter's version was brilliant in its ability to build tension, keeping masked madman Michael Myers hidden in shadow, having him strike at just the right moments. Zombie's version is also brilliant, but not in the same way: he gives the film a primal edge that perfectly captures the rage and evil that is Michael Myers.<br /><br />This is a good thing, especially since Zombie has created a much more compelling and understandable Michael Myers back-story, beginning in his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. As a ten-year-old boy (Daeg Faerch), Myers was disturbed, showing psychopathic behavior by hurting and killing animals. He also lived in a troubled household, with a verbally abusive stepfather (William Forsythe) and an uncaring, promiscuous older sister (Hanna Hall). The only person he loved--the only person who loved him back--was his mother (Sheri Moon Zombie), who earned a living as an exotic dancer. Everything changed fifteen years ago, on Halloween night; in a fit of rage, Myers savagely murdered his stepfather, his sister, and her boyfriend (both of whom refused to take him Trick-or-Treating).<br /><br />Eleven months later, Myers was institutionalized at the Smith Grove Sanitarium and put under the care of child psychologist Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell). He noticed how disconnected the boy was from the world, seeming unaware of what he did, continuously covering his face with masks made out of paper and crayon. The murder of a nurse permanently closed him off, leaving his mother heartbroken and Loomis baffled.<br /><br />The story then flashes forward to the present day. Now in his mid-twenties, Myers (Tyler Mane) is mute and obsessed with wearing masks. After learning that Loomis plans to stop all forms of therapy, Myers uses unnatural physical strength to escape during a patient transfer. His attacks are savage, using violence that's quick, raw, unnerving, and ultimately bloody (it should be noted that the aftermath of every murder is far gorier than anything seen in Carpenter's original film). After killing a truck driver in a rest stop bathroom and stealing his jumpsuit, Myers heads back to Haddonfield on Halloween, taking residence in his abandoned childhood home and covering his face with a dirty white mask hidden beneath the floor.<br /><br />From here, the film effectively pays homage to many of the original film's subtler nuances. We meet Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) and her friends Lynda (Kristina Klebe) and Annie (Danielle Harris, who played Jamie Strode in the fourth and fifth "Halloween" sequels). The three are typical high school girlfriends: popular, pretty, and boy-crazy. Both Laurie and Annie spend Halloween night babysitting, which introduces us to young Lindsay (Jenny Gregg Stewart) and Tommy (Skyler Gisondo). Like the Tommy of the original film, this new Tommy is curious about the Boogyman, so much so that it begins to annoy Laurie.<br /><br />As the film draws to a close, it becomes a taut, suspenseful ride, pitting the unlucky teenagers--primarily Laurie--against an incurable killing machine. If you haven't seen the original films, then I can't tell you why Laurie becomes his target; let's just say that the two are somehow connected. They play against each other during the final scenes, all of which crescendo to screaming heights. Zombie did not hold back in his attempts to frighten the audience, which is appropriate given the kind of film "Halloween" is. Just as Carpenter's original version defined the Teen Slasher film, Zombie's version defines creative reinterpreting; he took a well-established story and gave it some fresh blood, resulting in a frightening new film that respectfully pays tribute to its source (example: the inclusion of the original "'Halloween' Theme"). If you appreciate the art of horror filmmaking, then Rob Zombie's "Halloween" is the movie for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W3HLHIA9UP4D.html">A2W3HLHIA9UP4D</a><br/><p>The Halloween series has always been one of my favorite horror film series, and in fact, its probably the most well-rounded and credible horror series when to compared to Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and so on. After all, there are no really bad sequels in this series (with the exception of Halloween III which isn't a real horrible movie itself, but has nothing to to with the Michael Myers story and therefore really has no relevance). There has been no "Michael in Space" or "Zombie Michael Myers that gets buried and resurrected" plots in this series, and for that, I have to commend them for that. However, when I first heard about this "remake" of the original Halloween, I thought it was a terrible idea. Why in the world would you want to remake a classic like Halloween? Its just like all these other remakes that seem to dominate theaters these days. Can't anyone think of anything original anymore? And almost all these remakes are no not even close to being as good as the original film. There's absolutely no reason to remake a film like Halloween unless its only to cash in. And that's probably the real reason why this movie was even considered being made in the first place. These people know that its gonna bring in horror fans, both young and old, out of the woodwork. And of course, fans are gonna be critical and compare the two films relentlessly. So to all the movie producers and film makers out there..STOP REMAKING CLASSIC FILMS!! All you guys are doing is watering down and for the most part ruining the reputations of actual good movies!! Okay, now that off of my chest, let's start the review, shall we?<br /><br />  First of all, to say that this is purely a remake is incorrect. Its half prequel, half remake, really. But when I found out that Rob Zombie would be writing and directing the picture, my hopes got much brighter about the film. I love House of the 1,000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects, and I really thought that he would bring something new to the series but without screwing everything up. After watching the film in theaters, and now on DVD, I can't say that he didn't bring something new to Halloween series, but for the most part, I definitely think he did more harm than good. I just have a hard time accepting this movie as being anything but mediocre, really. There's just way too many things that I didn't like about the actual plot of the story, and yes, way too many differences, and flat out contradictions of that of the original Halloween. I know, maybe its unfair to compare it the original Halloween so closely, but dammit, I can't help it. I love the original film. Its gotta be one the best horror films ever made. And just don't like the fact that someone can come in and nearly change everything about it, and yet call it, if only partially in this case, a remake.<br /><br />  First off, almost all the backstory of the young Michael Myers is total contradiction to the original film. Yeah, I know there wasn't really anything shown or told about Myers' childhood or family life in any of the films, but then again, there was no hint of anything BAD happening to him either! Why did Zombie feel the need to put in every bad cliche into the home life of young Michael Myers. Living in a trashy environment, a stripper mom, an abusive, drunk father figure, a bitch of a sister, being bullied at school, being neglected, and the list goes on an on. It seems like Zombie was GIVING Michael Myers a reason to become the monster he became! That's not what the original film was about. The great thing about that film was the idea that no one knew why Michael did what he did. He had no reason. That's what's scary about it. How a normal boy could do something like that without a cause. But here, you don't have that.<br /><br />  Another thing I didn't like was the acting and the portrayal of some of the characters, especially the Lorrie Strode character played by Scout Taylor-Compton. She's just so damn annoying!! Geez, Jamie Lee Curtis did such a good job of playing the "girl next door" role, and here you have a annoying, bubbly, whore wanna be. I know that you gotta modernize the characters a bit, but c'mon! I was wanting Michael to kill Lorrie a minute into her first scene, not to mention her friends, which were just as bad! Now it is worth mentioning, that when the chase scenes with Lorrie and Michael begin, Taylor-Compton actually does a pretty good acting good there. Also, Daeg Faerch, who played young Michael Myers, and well as Sheri Moon Zombie, who played Michael's mother, Deborah, just didn't fit the parts to me. Faerch acting wasn't all that great, and he just didn't look the part, and Sheri Moon's acting was alright, but seeing her play that kind of role just doesn't look right to me. And Malcolm McDowell didn't exactly put on a brilliant performance himself either.<br /><br />  Other things I didn't like..well.. the scene where 10 year old Michael kills his sister in his trademark mask just looks, well..stupid. The mask is huge and looks dumb on a child's body, and its not scary at all. Not even a little. And speaking of body, I really thought that the Michael Myers character was too physically big. Michael Myers is supposed just some average looking guy, not a professional wrestler, so why make him so larger than life? The way Michael seems to "grunt" numerous times in the film, what the heck is up with that? And the way Michael seems to try "interrogate" Lorrie's step mom by showing her Lorrie's picture and I assume, trying to find where she was at..just way out of the Michael Myers character for me. I also thought the music was mis-used in the film. At times, it felt like Zombie was trying to use the music to build a mood, when there was really nothing there to build upon.<br /><br />  Alright, enough of the bashing of this film. I actually have some good things to say about it. After all, I am giving it 3 stars! First off, I like the blood gore content. A definite step up from the original, though just to make things clear, you don't need blood and guts and gore to make a film, nor does that stuff make a film good. But I'm just saying I liked that aspect of this film. Also, the guys who did the Michael Myers mask did a great job on this one. It looks real close to the original mask. And speaking of the mask, Tyler Mane does a pretty decent job of portraying Michael Myers as well. I also felt that the last half hour of the film was real good too. I especially liked the scenes where Lorrie was hiding from Michael in-between the walls and in the loft of the house. I thought Zombie really did a good job there.<br /><br />  So finally I've come to the end of this ungodly long review! Thanks to those you've actually read this whole thing. In closing, I know that I'm probably being too critical about some of the things I didn't like about this film. And if I had never seen the original, or wasn't a big fan of the original film, I probably wouldn't be so critical and be picking out every single little thing that's different from the original. I know that when a remake of a film is made, you can't simply copy everything from the original, otherwise, what's the point in remaking it? But on the other hand, how can you call something a remake, when in fact, there are so few similarities between it and the original? There's got to be some balance somewhere. Anyways,as a stand alone film, maybe its better than I'm giving it credit for. And if it hadn't been a "Halloween" movie, and just another horror film, I might have loved it. And again, that's why I'm giving it a benefit of a doubt and trying to ignore my biased opinion and giving this film 3 stars. However, I can't help to compare to the original classic. And this one doesn't ever really come close in capturing the mood or suspense that the original film did. And as far as comparing to the other films in the series, this is one of the worse. Is it worth watching or worth owning? I say yes to both. But its nothing really great to watch, and I wouldn't say its a "must buy" unless you have all the other Halloween films and need for your collection. And thats one of the very few reasons, I own this film right now.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I loved Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN! It was everything I hoped it would be and more. I saw this the first day it came out. I couldn't possibly wait another day. I loved the beginning showing Michael, his mom; Deborah, Judith, baby Laurie, and Deborah's boyfriend; Ronnie White. I loved how we meet Dr. Loomis. I love the scenes at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. I love how Michael breaks out. (Not the unrated version of how he breaks out!) I love how Michael gets his clothes from Big Joe Grizzley. I love when they show Michael putting his infamous mask on and they play the HALLOWEEN music! I love it when Laurie finally meets Michael at the Wallace house, I loved it when Dr. Loomis tries to kill Michael. I especially loved the ending. To me, Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN is just as good as John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN! I highly recommend this film to all HALLOWEEN fans!<br /><br />HALLOWEEN begins in Haddonfield, Illinois on October 31st in the morning. Michael is 'playing' with his rat. We see how it is in his house with the white-trash Ronnie White, his mom and sister. During school, he gets in a fight and Dr. Loomis sees that he is at the early stage of becoming a psyschopath. On HALLOWEEN night while Deborah Myers is at the Rabbit In Red Lounge stripping, Michael kills Judith, her boyfriend, and Ronnie. He is transferred to Smith's Grove Sanitarium. During his years there, Dr. Loomis tries to help him, but he gets a lot worse, and I really feel sorry for Deborah when she realizes what a monster her son has become. 15 years later, Michael escapes and goes back to Haddonfield on HALLOWEEN. Throughout the day, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, and Lynda see Michael stalking them. When Laurie babysits Tommy Doyle, Annie makes Laurie watch Lindsey Wallace also. While Annie and her boyfriend, Paul are having sex, Michael strikes again, and waits for Laurie. Laurie finds Annie bloody, so she calls the police. Sheriff Brackett and Dr. Loomis hurry to the rescue, but Michael has already captured Laurie and taken her back to the Myers house. Will Laurie escape? Will Dr. Loomis find her in time? You gotta watch the movie to find out! If you love horror, remakes, and Rob Zombie's work, you'll love HALLOWEEN!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>prior to watching this movie,i'd heard people say that director Rob Zombie had butchered the franchise with his take on the Halloween lore.i don't share that viewpoint.i though the movie had a lot of good points to it.i thought the casting of Malcom McDowell was genius.he plays his character tongue in cheek,and really i think that's the whole tone of the movie.and it worked for me.there are some serious parts and the movie even has a moral,but it doesn't hit you over the head with anything.the violence is more sudden and a bit more graphic than the 1978 version.the acting is better in this movie,i think.the actor who played the grown up Micheal Myers(the psycho) is very convincing.and the child who played young Michael Myers is perfect for the role.the movie does tend to be slow in spots,but i still think it is a better movie than the original version.there is a lot of crude language in the movie and a fair amount of nudity,so be warned.for me,Halloween (2007)is a 3.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Halloween" is great! The directing by Rob Zombie (who also directed "House Of 1000 Corpses" (2003) & "The Devil's Rejects" (2005) is great. Most of the cast and crew that Zombie has worked with is working with him, again. The cast led by Malcolm McDowell (as Dr. Samuel Loomis) & Sheryl Moon Zombie (as Deborah Myers) (who also is Zombie's wife and has starred in Zombie's "House Of 1000 Corpses" & "The Devil's Rejects"), is great. The screenplay by Zombie (based on John Carpenter's and Debra Hill's screenplay) (who also wrote the screenplay to "House Of 1000 Corpses" & "The Devil's Rejects") is great. The music by Tyler Bates (who also did the music to "300" (2007), "Slither" (2006), "The Devil's Rejects", & "Dawn Of The Dead" (2004) is excellent. The cinematography by Phil Parmet (who also did the cinematography to "The Devil's Rejects") is great.

This is a great remake that is faithful to the original and a little bit more inventive.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>When you're doing a remake of a movie that was done right the first time, you have to differentiate it, take the same premise and go down some different paths than the first one took.  The 2007 Halloween remake does this, and it helps make it one of the best horror remakes ever done.<br /><br />  The most obvious deviation from the original line of films is that Michael Myers now has an origin.  A large part of what made the original work was the very lack of a reason behind the character's malevolence: Michael was a perfectly normal little kid who, for no discernible reason, picks up a kitchen knife one October 31 and butchers his sister, beginning a years-long cycle as a mute, endlessly killing, boogeyman.  This time there's nothing normal about Michael to begin with.  He was born with psychotic tendencies and then grew up in an envirornment of abuse and torment; either of these factors - the nature or the nurture - could have resulted in a murderer, but coming together they create what Sam Loomis (played by Malcolm McDowell in the role Donald Pleasance originally made famous) calls a 'perfect storm', that creates the monsterous killing machine Myers becomes.  It was a big risk to change the core of the character from an eerily blank slate to the more human monster we have in this version, but it worked great, and Myers (played by Tyler Mane as an adult and Daeg Faerch as a ten year-old) is menacing enough to leave just that little glimmer that Maybe there's even more at play behind that white mask than the aforementioned factors.<br /><br />  The other big change is the time frame.  The 1978 original opens with Myers as a child but that takes up only a few minutes - 95% of the movie occurs on the Halloween day and night fifteen years later when Michael returns to his hometown of Haddonfield.  Here, the movie starts some time before the night Michael becomes a killer and continues through the years that follow, including his incarceration at a mental hospital and his eventual, devastating escape and return to Haddonfield.  We see the evolution of the monster in full, and by the time he's back home on Halloween night Myers is a tremendous, truly frightening force.<br /><br />  Everything from the acting to the direction and the special effects, musical score, etc. is extremely high caliber and in addition to being scary and, at times, surprisingly moving, it's also one of the sexiest horror movies out there thanks to a cast of great looking actresses including Danielle Harris, Scout Taylor-Compton, Kristina Klebe, Hanna Hall and Sheri Moon Zombie.  Also of interest on the acting front are appearances by Bill Mosely and Danny Trejo (both from director Rob Zombie's Firefly films - "The House Of 1,000 Corpses" and "The Devil's Rejects") and Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky from the "Child's Play" movies).  Effective use of music and a number of hugely memorable visual images are also worth noting.<br /><br />  The 2007 Halloween doesn't take the place of the original series, nor does it set out to; it extablishes itself as a great, Different take on the original concept and characters, and manages to match anything from the original series.  A horror essential.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O5T5VAQ3TD17.html">A3O5T5VAQ3TD17</a><br/><p>This is a great movie, I really loved how they focused on Michael from childhood up.  If your a fan of horror/blood and guts then I highly recommend buying this movie.  It is well worth $13 at Wally World.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>As I have said in other reviews, the unrated versions of films on DVD have become the defacto Gold Standard.<br />I saw this film in theatre and I was wowed by the power and impact of film, even though the supernatural element seemed a little drained from the film.For someone like Rob Zombie, the surreal seems to reign supreme in his art, but that was in what I saw in the Booklet art of HELLBILLY DELUXE, however, in film Rob seems to want to go for the "real".<br /> The First part of the film was, as I understand it, shot basically shot in sequence, so that by the time they got to Institution sequences, not only has the Young actor playing Michael actually Grown, but Tyler Mane gets a chance to incorporate Young Michaels moves into his own styles.Probably the most shocking scenes and therefore the best items to watch and pick apart, take place at the Institution, the Truck Stop ( Ken Foree is just so Cool in a scene he makes so his own, even though you have two huge guys obviously trying to outdo each other, and this is more<br />so when you realise that the side of the stall they damage is NOT the stunt stall, its the real metal), and the element I find most surprising is that whilst Young Michael ( the actor) needs a stunt double, so does [ they said] the Huge Tyler Mane;Tyler Objected to the Double on one point, and the double for "Young Michael" is a girl... my question is, before hearing the commentary or the features, can you pick them ?<br />Anyways, This Unrated is a very well deserved edition. Expect more... you might even pick up some of the tricks on how Michael Hides in a shot, when he is 6'9 and hard to miss.<br /><br />DVD: The Bonus Features. Standout features on this are the deleted scenes or the Bloopers where Malcolm McDowell and Brad Douriff do a brilliant job at riffing off each other ( if only these two had been contracted to do a Commentary track with cast).The Features are worth it indeed. The Commentary however, is technically informative, but dry and unentertaining as you could have it. If they are going to have a film school class track, they could at least have an entertaining commentary track. Rob's "Commentary as Director" track has its purpose, but it needed a track for more entertaining elements.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M.html">A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M</a><br/><p>... it has to sting when another director "kills" your crowning achievement.<br /><br />Here's the thing: I had actually read the horrendous critical reviews of Zombie's film and thought, "When have critics ever understood horror?" So, in a weird way, I guess I have only myself to blame ...<br /><br />As someone who teaches horror-film theory and horror-film studies, I know what will endure the ages and what will not. Still, I'm not some jaded academic. I love horror ... the more (figuratively) visceral, the better. Carpenter's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009UW0N">Halloween</a> (1978) is well-respected by film scholars (even the snobbiest!) for a reason: it manages to inspire terror with little on-screen bloodshed ... much like Hooper's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FS9FE4">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a> (1974).  Neither of these works necessitate a remake. And, while Nispel's 2003 revisit of "TCM" elicited tension and revulsion (both good), Zombie's "Halloween" only elicited anger.<br /><br />Foremost, the film is technically unpolished. At one point, the viewer becomes convinced that Loomis (McDowell) is responsible for Myers's adult outbursts. In early therapy sessions, Loomis and Myers both wear black ... it becomes the topic of their conversation. It draws a parallel between the two. Then, Loomis pens an account of his experience with Myers and begins a book-tour. The scene opens with a projection of Myers' face ... and as Loomis utters "Behind these eyes one finds only blackness, they absence of light, these are of a psychopath" the camera moves to an extreme close-up of Loomis' eyes. So for the entire film, the viewer waits for the "other shoe to drop" ... for Loomis to confess some (perhaps "unconscious") involvement in Myers' now silent rage. But this never happens ... so one is led to ask, why create these parallels and then fail to complete the message? At best, we may discover the connection in the director's cut ... at worst, it was a really unforgivable error in filming.<br /><br />The casting of Myers is horrendous. Why make him physically monstrous? Carpender's original casting of Nick Castle was clever (tall but muscular), Zombie's casting of WWF/WCW wrestler Tyler Mane (6'8 and grotesquely built) was all too literal. Carpender's Myers terrifies audiences without having to appear physically extraordinary ... he is "The Shape" (for those in the know) ... not "The Lumbering Blob."<br /><br />Moreover, by providing one of the most wretched back-stories I have ever witnessed, Zombie destroys Carpenter's most gruesome message ... some people are born evil. This is why Donner's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EYK4KS">The Omen</a> (1976) was so gripping. Damien was born evil ... no amount of compassion (mother's love/father's love) could alter that which was encoded on the child's DNA (if you will). To make Myers' a product of his environment ... well, that's just obvious. I forgot, was this a film or an after-school special?<br /><br />These are the most unbelievably painful problems ... I'll not even launch into the needless deaths of several adults who DO NOT warrant such treatment (by logic and theory). Or Zombie's vile treatment of a "Halloween" cult-favorite like Danielle Harris (creepy, but in a pathetic way). Maybe Zombie thought he was evolving the genre ... maybe he thought was modernizing Carpenter's work ... maybe he needs to mature (but he's already forty-five) and learn from the masters (like Carpenter and Hooper): less is better.<br /><br />So, I return to my original question ... "When have critics ever understood horror?" I guess I must have forgot that the critics were blown-away by Romero's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IQNAG">Dawn of the Dead</a> (1978), raved over Kubrick's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ATQJ">The Shining</a> (1980), lauded Hooper's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V4UFZK">Poltergeist</a> (1982), gushed over Shyamalan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004BZIY">The Sixth Sense</a> (1999), and loved Boyle's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMA8">28 Days Later</a> (2003). I guess they have always known what constitutes film worthy of an audience. Next time, I hope I will take my cue from these professionals ... and, I sincerely hope Zombie will do likewise.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>There's a scene in the original Halloween where through the camera's POV complete with holes functioning as our eyes, we follow a figure walk through a house, grab a knife and proceed upstairs to viciously attack a young girl only for it at the end to be a young boy in a clown mask. Later he grows into an unstoppable killing machine that stalks and terrorizes comes after you and no bullet or knife can stop him. It was that feeling of an evil that would continously coming after you that made "the Shape" such a memorable horror icon. Apparently that notion was lost on Rob Zombie who thought that clearly we need an explanation as to why he'd be such a monster (beware of hick families is the message here) and not only from a story standpoint but from a filmmaking one as well, the new Halloween just hits all the wrong notes - no pun intended, Mr. Zombie - the whole time.<br /><br />Michael Myers is a seriously disturbed young boy growing up with a promiscuous sister, a controlling father figure and a stripper mother who at least tries to help. But after viciously killing his family, save his mother, Michael is institutionalized under care of Dr. Samuel Loomis. But 15 years pass and Michael escapes and makes his way back to his home of Haddonfield where he tries to track down his baby sister, Laurie.<br /><br />Whereas "the Shape" of 1978 liked to appear in the shadows, ominously watching teenagers unaware to his presence, this new guy likes to just mindlessly bash stuff in and be as loud as possible (he's like one of those hulking brutes with the deep voice and lack of intelligence that school bullies have for protection) and this practically sucks the suspense right from the film. Remember that scene where Michael sits right up behind Laurie who doesn't see him? Nothing like that here. Not to mention the gaps in the story like the lack of trick-or-treaters, Michael's seemingly psychic knowledge of Laurie's school schedule, her present appearance, much less her name. Then of course there's things in the filmmaking spectrum like out-of-focus shots, out-of-character decisions and dialogue, continuity errors like crazy and just strange cuts (in one scene, Laurie is behind hauled away by Michael kicking and screaming and in the next shot, she's passed out being carried off by Michael. Uh, did he punch her out?) With the Zombie trademark of characters swearing with reckless abandon, and I might add, zero creativity, this Halloween version is just unfortunate.<br /><br />As far as casting is concerned, the Samuel Loomis of this one, played by Malcolm Macdowell is a good one and the young boy playing Michael is good as well while the rest either overact, don't act enough or just not simply given nothing to do. The new Laurie, played by Scout Taylor-Compton, is easy on the eyes but she almost seems to be given one direction: be cute and scream your face off when the terror starts. The casting is just one of many a problem that the film faces and quite simply, there's just not enough to recommend.<br /><br />In all good seriousness, I just can't recommend this. Sure it does stand out from Carpenter's original and not just a clone and the idea of exploring the evil sounds like a good idea but this is just one unfortunate business of a film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>I can change the text but I cannot change the star rating. Anyways, I didnt like this movie at first. It took me about three minutes until I changed my mind. Rob Zombie set the story straight and I like how he was very honest about this movie. Its a very good movie if your not looking for a complete scene to scene remake of the original. Thanks to Rob Zombie for that comment. I still hate things about the movie but i'd give it four stars anyways. Its Zombie's idea and vision and I respect that. His commentary on the dvd is very well done. Ive heard him do it before on anther one of his movies. He is very well spoken and gives good insight to his vision and movie. I cant wait for his next movie and I wonder what horror classic they'll make remake next. Great movie, four out of five stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>As a die-hard fan of Carpenter's classic, I was incredibly dissapointed & angry at this lame, trashy remake.<br /><br />The problem with this "Halloween" is:<br /><br />1. Zombie needs to stop, & I mean stop, casting his films with entire casts from his previous films. The entire cast from "Devil's Rejects" is here & it was really annoying. He also needs to bring his films into the present. Enough with the white trash 70's.<br /><br />2. The film spends way, way too much time in Michael's youth. He kills his sister - we know this going into the picture, since we're versed in Carpenter's original. This makes the movie sag like William Forsythe's stomach. Putting a human face on Michael Myers was also a big mistake.<br /><br />In the original, the grown up Michael was known as "The Shape", for the simple reason being, is that behind that mask was the simple definition of pure evil incarnate. In Zombie's remake, basically, Myers turns out to be just another a-hole gone psychotic from a byproduct of white trash American society. Get him a job at the local post office & he would fit right in.<br /><br />3. The timeline in this film is totally f***ed. I can only assume that the beginning of this film starts on Halloween of 1978, since little Mikey is listening to "God Of Thunder", has a Kiss t-shirt on, & the entire atmosphere looks like, at least, poor whitetrash mid-seventies. So add 15 years to 1978 add at least 2 or 3 more for good measure & you still come up to 1995, 96 at best. Thats all well & good until Lynda tries to make a call on her cell phone, topless, in the Myers house.<br /><br />4. Tyler Mane as Michael Myers. I really had no problem with this until he first shows up in his cell in a bathrobe & slippers. Its gets worse as he turns around with an orange mask on his face that reminded me of the WWE's Kane. I was waiting for the Undertaker to show up for god's sake! "Rest in Peace"? You bet.<br /><br />5. Michael actually catches Laurie - & doesn't kill her. What!?!? That's like Wyle E. Coyote catching The Road Runner, turning to the audience, & saying, "What do I do now?"<br /><br />6. The score. Not here it isn't. Carpenter's haunting opening theme is used in Zombie's film 4 times at best & at all the wrong times. Zombie uses old school 70's tunes during different scenes. Not bad, but this is "Halloween" not "High School Musical".<br /><br />7. Its not scary. It's almost like watching an epiosde of A&E's "Cold Case File" or "American Justice". Zombie doesn't really set any tone or atmosphere for the film. Its just one set piece after another.<br /><br />8. The ending. Absolute bull***t.<br /><br />Stick with Carpenter's eternal classic, because next Halloween this remake will be forgotten, like last years autumn leaves</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>First off, the original Halloween is my favorite horror film and I knew with Rob Zombie directing, things would get very twisted. The constant swearing (this coming from a guy who watched HBO's Deadwood) was way too frequent in the first twenty minutes. Thankfully that thinned out as the story progressed. It felt too much like the recent Texas Chainsaw remakes for my tastes. The acting wasn't as bad as most critics are saying and some of the dialogue actually made me laugh a bit. This is a very brutal movie to say the least. Even when Rob doesn't show a lot of gore, the way he films some of the murders is flat out disturbing (especially the ones involving young Michael).<br /><br />I'm glad he kept the famous music and didn't shy away from showing some nudity. The MPAA seems to feel that showing a little skin is worse than peeling it off someone and deep frying it. What are these suits thinking?<br /><br />The back story was nearly an hour long (1/2 hour too long) and the second half with the girls felt rushed. You just get to know them and in the next scene they are dead.<br /><br />Overall, Rob didn't impress or disappoint me too much. This is really the kind of film I figured he would turn in. For me, I liked Michael Myers better as a mystery.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>In fact, I was actually bored throughout the first Halloween, and never bothered to watch any of the MANY sequels. My mum loves the original movies for some reason, but I just never saw the appeal.<br /><br />When I was asked to go and see the Rob Zombie 'remake', I was sceptical to say the least. I didn't remember too much of the original, the occasional scene here and there. But I do like Rob Zombie movies, and own House of 1000 Corpses and Devil's Rejects. He at least seemed like a good choice to do a remake, even if it was unnecessary.<br /><br />The movie starts with a young Michael Myers at home with his mum (Sheri Moon Zombie), his older sister, his baby sister, and his deadbeat stepfather. His stepfather and mother have many screaming matches during the opening scenes, and Michael seems to be caught up in all this. His older sister doesn't seem to care about him, his younger sister doesn't have a clue what's going on, and his mother would care about him if she wasn't constantly trying to clear up after his stepfather and doing her poledancing job. The sister's promiscuous, and looks to follow in the footsteps of her mother with a deadbeat boyfriend.<br /><br />I won't reveal anything more about the movie, for those who haven't seen it (but you need to go and see it). Sheri Moon's role is unfortunately, not as long as her previous movies, but she's still terrific, if getting a tad skinny.<br /><br />What shocked me about this version of Halloween, is that I actually found myself sympathising with Michael's character. With the whole build up as to what started him off killing (what do you expect with that family?), Rob Zombie does give the impression that he's trying to give Michael a heart, a conscience. The other strange thing is that after the age of 10, you never see Michael's face. He's hiding his face behind his hair, and eventually, the infamous mask, and you desperately try to picture a grown up Michael, but it didn't work for me, I always ended up picturing a 10-year-old's face behind the mask.<br /><br />The film does start to stutter when it skips to the present day, which I think was supposed to be set in the mid nineties, and it did start to go on a go slow for me.<br /><br />Halloween I didn't think was scary, much the same as I thought about the original. But it's so, so, so gory, it's unbelievable. A teenage girl (the actress was in her late twenties) lying topless, stabbed numerous times, still alive. A man, with his throat slashed, still desperately trying to work out what has happened, as the blood bubbles down his front. Bleurgh.<br /><br />There's a great cast in this, of course including Sheri Moon Zombie, Brad Dourif (unrecognisable from his role as Billy in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest), Malcolm McDowell, and look out for Captain Spaulding too. Hehe.<br /><br />There is nudity in this - pretty, pert, perky teenage girls rolling around in bed with deadbeat men, and sending their men out for beer. Watch out for one funny bit, where the 'boyfriend' walks back in with the beer, and the girl doesn't even notice he's grown about a foot and a half in a few minutes. Hello, you'd think that would be obvious! Now get your chest off the screen and die already.<br /><br />Halloween 2007 is definitely superior to the 1978 version in my opinion. Many, many reviewers are going to heavily disagree with me on that point, and I've already seen my fair share of one star reviews. But it's not a bad movie. It's well worth seeing, and believe me, if you don't find it scary, you will be turning your face away from the screen when someone gets their throat cut.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>Rob, you've had me frustrated with this film from the very beginning. The fact it was being made, that you were doing it, and then the horrendous reviews that were coming in from critics and "online" people. I went into the movie expecting the worst after reading these so called "reviews", and I came out very happy. No movie in recent memory has had me frustrated, nor have I been so led astray from online communities I usually believe. Rob Zombie's interpretation of the 1978 John Carpenter original is by no means a masterpiece. It is flawed, it has cliches, it has holes big enough to drive a semi thru, and parts that expect you to defy all logic. That being said, it was an interesting ride. You all know the story, so no need to get into that. The second the movie starts, it's a bit jarring. It is definitley a Rob Zombie movie, but definitley not a Halloween movie. Things get better once little Michael starts to snap. I was not a fan of the redneck, hillbilly, white trash section of this film, but it gets good when Michael finally flips. Plus, Sheri Moon Zombie is surprisingy emotional and touching in places. William Forsythe?. Well, he's William Forsythe. The second section, at Smith's Grove, is quite interesting. Michael's break out is a little too easy, but riveting nonetheless. The third section, where things really take us to "Halloween" land, is not a "shot by shot remake" that others would lead you to believe. There are some dialogue lifted from the original, and some classic scenes are recreated. However, most of these recreated scenes have a different touch to them, and this half also has new scenes, outcomes, directions, and so on, that cancel out ALL claims that it is a shot by shot remake. Zombie always keeps things interesting and interesting looking, if not some of the characters. He has littered the movie from start to finish with numerous decorations, pumpkins, and trick or treaters, to make this movie feel more like Halloween than even the original, and a number of the sequels. The three teenage girls are a problem. The Laurie character is no Jamie Lee, but she doesn't quite get as short changed as the other two, especially the Linda character. This part of the film felt a bit rushed and poorly thought out. At least Danielle Harris is still beautiful!. Malcolm McDowell is a welcomed Loomis. Once you see him and hear his voice, you realize that there is no other person but him who could of been Loomis. As for Tyler Mane, I was ready to hate his Michael, but I didn't. I still think he's too big, but he was effective and creepy in places. Brad Dourif was a fun choice for Sheriff Brackett, but like other B movie veterans, he is underused and discarded not long after he's introduced. The violence makes Carpenter's original look PG rated. Brutal violence like this has it's place, but I don't care for it in a Halloween movie. That being said, it didn't take me out of the picture as stated by other critics. However, I did feel a scene here and there were quite pointless and were just there to be extreme and hardcore, as if Rob couldn't dream up some scares so he wanted to just jolt people again. The score is teriffic. Bits of Carpetner's original are here and there, as well as Tyler Bates' own. Folks, this isn't the hatchet job a lot of Zombie haters and Halloween purists(of which I am one)are ballyhooing about. It's a very strong and interesting film that had me hooked from start to finish. There is no denying that nothing will ever top or match Carpenter's scary classic, but this was probably the best Halloween since the original, and the first to really give out that classic Halloween vibe, especially in the third act. I never thought I would find myself defending a Rob Zombie movie, since I was not a fan of his other films, but here I am. It's wicked, it's nasty, it's atmospheric, it's creepy, and it's just a wild ride. The first horror movie in a long time to really grab me and make me think about it afterward. Rob, I was all set to write some witty attacks on your film, but I won't get to use them. Instead, I say thanks, thanks for making a Halloween film that really hits you for the first time in nearly 30 years.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E9TRM8096BXU.html">A2E9TRM8096BXU</a><br/><p>My first reaction to Rob Zombie's remake of HALLOWEEN was: "Why?" The film is near-perfect as it is, and didn't need to be remade or, as the idiotic studio-suit buzzword goes, "re-imagined." But what the hell. Since Hollywood isn't interested in new ideas, and Zombie has apparently run out of such ideas as he has, I guess it was inevitable. This leads me to my second reaction, post-watching-the-film, which is, "Is Rob Zombie a f-ing idiot or what? Doesn't he get why this was a good movie in the first place?"<br /><br />I don't say this to be abusive. I do believe Zombie has some talent and aesthetic style. The problem is that his style - at least as it pertains to HALLOWEEN -- is the wrong one. You don't use a sledgehammer to do a flyswatter's job, and you don't let a sadistic, gore-infatuated fanboy direct a horror masterpiece. The original HALLOWEEN was great for a lot of reasons, but chief among them, it didn't overanalyze its villain. And this is the real point that needs to be made here, because what Zombie does to his HALLOWEEN is part of an much wider and sillier trend in modern horror - the need to provide a reason why its killers do what they do.<br /><br />If I had to sum up the original, John Carpenter-directed version of the film in one phrase, it would be this: "Yes, Virginia, there really is a Boogeyman." That's basically it. The motivations of the film's masked, mouth-breathing murderer, Michael Myers, are never explained to any meaningful degree, because - gasp! - they don't have a rational explanation. Michael doesn't get an "origin story"; no insight is provided as to why he murdered his sister Judith as a young boy, or why he's re-enacting the crime on a much larger scale as an adult. He's killing Because. Just BECAUSE. That's as much why as you get. It's almost Biblical. ("Who are you?" Moses asks the burning bush. "Who I AM." God replies. "I Am Who I AM.") As Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) explains to the Sheriff, Michael is not so much a human being as an embodiment of Evil itself, a Bad Thing that Happens to Good People. He's the Book of Job in a William Shatner mask. (That's why, incidentally, he's credited at the end of the film not as Michael Myers, but as "The Shape": he's taken the shape of your fears, whatever they might be.) But HALLOWEEN is not less scary for this lack of information. Quite the contrary. It's scarier precisely because we don't get the satisfaction. There is no "Why?" where Michael is concerned. He just Is.<br /><br />Zombie isn't satisfied with that answer, and so he's approached the film from a different angle - the angle of the "origin story." Here, Michael's origin is that as a child, he was abused, neglected, picked-on, and basically f'd from birth. As a result, he developed into an unspeaking, sadistic, remorseless killer. Very neat. Very plausible. And completely missing the point. Because by reducing Michael to a set of influences, mere cause and effect, he's also taking away nearly all his power as a villain. There's a reason we don't look behind the curtain in Oz; we might discover the Wizard is a sweaty dwarf on a treadmill. That's not cool. That's boring. And so is this film. Because not only does Zombie ruin the best aspect of HALLOWEEN - the almost-supernatural Boogeyman angle - he also viciously stomps the other aspect that made the original special -  its sense of restraint. Carpenter had enough sense to understand that what is left out of a movie is often just as important as what is left in. Instead of a few perfectly set-up and executed murders, we get a gigantic massacre that quickly numbs. Instead of a few drops of blood, we get buckets of steaming gore (always the first refuge of the hack who can't actually scare his audience). Instead of long cat-and-mouse games with totally unsuspecting victims that rack up the tension to an unbearable degree, climaxing in sudden death, we get drawn-out bludgeonings, followed by nonfatal stabbings, followed by near-escapes, followed by more bludgeonings and finally, fatal stabbings. Zombie's complete lack of subtlety, his refusal to leave anything to the imagination, isn't just bad film-making in and of itself; it's completely unsuited to the telling of this particular tale. Using him to do a HALLOWEEN remake is like using a rusty chainsaw to perform eye surgery.<br /><br />I suppose you could make an argument that since this is a remake (excuse me, a "re-imagining"), Zombie was entitled, even obligated, to go in a different direction than Carpenter, one which has Dr. Loomis actually apologizing to Michael for "failing" him instead of blasting him with a .38, 'cause tha's what you do with Pure Evil when you find it. But even here the film falls down, because if Michael is a pure sociopath, as Malcom McDowell's version of Loomis maintains, Loomis has little to apologize for. See, while the jury's still out about whether a psychopath/sociopath can be actually be "made" in childhood (as opposed to simply "born wrong") there is universal agreement that neither sociopathy nor psychopathy are actually curable. How can a doctor fail the incurable? And this brings us back to the whole idea that made Carpenter's flick scary: that pure Evil is something outside of human influence, happening on its own terms for its own reasons and not subject to psychological analysis or treatment. (Donald Pleasance's Loomis ultimately got that Michael couldn't be "reached" - except by bullets.) Put simply, the genius of the original HALLOWEEN is that it ducked all the moral-psychological elements Zombie embraces and concentrated on one simple idea, best summed up by the last two lines of dialogue in the film:<br /><br />LAURIE STRODE: (sobbing) Was that the Boogeyman?<br />DR. LOOMIS: As a matter of fact...it was.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>I hate remakes.  The horror genre has become a breeding ground for remakes and re-hashes of classic films in the genre, as is the case with Halloween.  As flawed as House of 1000 Corpses was, musician turned director Rob Zombie more than made up for it with The Devil's Rejects, which really seemed to find him coming into his own.  That's why I was looking forward to the Halloween remake, of which I had heard both great and terrible things about.  After viewing it, well, it's not nearly as terrible as what I had heard, but at the same time, the film is a needless remake that wastes much of it's potential.  The subtlety of John Carpenter's original classic is replaced with brutal violence and buckets of blood, as we witness the beginnings of Michael Myers' (played as a child by Daeg Faerch, and later by X-Men's Tyler Mane) journey to becoming a killer from his childhood on, as Zombie makes an attempt to give the viewer a sympathetic view towards Michael.  The relationship with Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) is further examined as well, as is Michael's return to Haddonfield.  The abundance of backstory and sympathetic view towards Michael Myers is where Halloween fails, but where it succeeds is with Zombie's techniques for getting the most out of the shocks and scares that he pummels the viewer with.  The final act, in which Michael faces off with Laurie Strode (the super cute Scout Taylor-Compton), is a visceral blast, as is what leads up to it.  As he has done before, Zombie has peppered genre stalwarts throughout the film, including his wife Sheri Moon, Brad Dourif, William Forsythe, Dee Wallace, Clint Howard, Udo Kier, Bill Moseley, Danny Trejo, Dawn of the Dead's Ken Foree, Sid Haig, and an all grown up Danielle Harris, whose role here is a far cry from the petrified child of Halloween 4 and 5.  The two-disc Unrated edition features an insightful commentary from Zombie, plenty of deleted scenes (including Adrienne Barbeau's deleted role), a more downbeat alternate ending, and a pretty funny blooper reel.  Not for the faint of heart to be sure, Rob Zombie's Halloween remake isn't anything spectacular, but it's nothing terrible in the least either, and more than worth checking out for horror/slasher fans young and old alike.</p></br><a href="../users/A2U80IPZXN5V1U.html">A2U80IPZXN5V1U</a><br/><p>When Rob Zombie released a remake of the first Halloween movie in 2007 reactions were mixed and many fans of the original couldn't understand why he was making a remake.  This remake is different from the original and Zombie's remake of Halloween came as a total surprise to me; I didn't expect to like it at all and thought that he was going to ruin a classic of horror films. It goes deeper into the original Halloween story which I thought was fascinating and well done, it explains things and gives the movie more depth. I liked how the movie started with Michael Myers as a child and the flashback sequences which explained what just happened as Myers killed members of his family. You see an interview with Myers as a child and the setting is very interesting it tries to explain what happened. Then the movie progresses to the point where he is older and escapes from prison and murders people. There is more gore and everything seems more brutal than in the original which was to be expected and makes it more according to today's standards in horror movies. Some things are different and entertaining and are not an exact copy of the original scene by scene which I thought was well done and creative of Rob Zombie. It's like he took the movie and added things to it and made it his own.<br /><br />Most remakes tend to be pretty bad (even if there are some great ones) and contrary to what many fans thought of Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween I actually enjoyed it and found it was a decent remake. Make no mistake this remake is not as good as the original one and it will never be I just think it was good and that it gave the movie an interesting twist to it. I thought it turned out better than some of the sequels. All I can say is that it's worth watching fans of the original or just curious people.</p></br><a href="../users/A2O97GKCSISM3F.html">A2O97GKCSISM3F</a><br/><p>Whether you saw the theatrical or director's cut, unless you're a die-hard Rob Zombie fan, (and I'm not!)this film is not owner's material.<br />The language is way too constant, and the violence is needlessly graphic.<br />If John Carpenter really wanted his film re-made, he should've done it himself, or gotten any other director to do it, besides Rob Zombie, he doesn't have the slightest idea what he's doing and should continue writing music, and retire from directing.<br />I give this film 3 stars for two reasons: Malcolm McDowell and the explanation for what made Michael go nuts, this is rent-material only.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I did like how Rob Zombie made this remake very different from the original 1978 masterpiece of horror. Most horror film remakes today are the exact same film with bigger production values and zero horror. At least Rob made something totally fresh, though it has many flaws. I liked Michael Myers much better when I knew nothing about him. Now he is given a more realistic abused past and thus makes him human. Big mistake. The acting is decent enough for a horror film, but even the original wasn't the best acted film, so I can't really knock this one too much in that department. I think this is the third best film in the Halloween series after Halloween and Halloween II. Hallween 4 was okay, but all the rest aren't worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>The unrated director's cut of Rob Zombie's remake of "Halloween" coming out in time for Christmas?  Well, the movie only came out on August 31st of this year, which I thought was two months early for this particular film, but apparently that was so they could still get the DVD out in time for it to be an ironic if not perverse stocking stuffer (the movie was still in theaters at the start of December).  Marketing strategy aside, it should be made clear that this film is actually more than a remake of John Carpenter's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00104AL5Y">original</a>.  The story of how young Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch) became a killer as a little kid is now the entire first act of the film and not simply the prologue, and in Zombie's revisions it is made clear why Michael picked up that big knife and started slicing and dicing.  Bullied at school, abused at home by his wicked stepfather (William Forsythe), and saddled with a stripper for a mom (Sheri Moon Zombie), Michael has more than his fair share of issues.<br /><br />We also get to see some of Michael's sessions with Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) and what happened to make Michael's baby sister an orphan.  This reflects the other significant difference between this and the original, which is that this time around we know that Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) is Michael's sister.  Actually, in the final analysis this movie covers what happens in the original and what happens in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LC4Q">sequel</a> (and if you want to stretch things Michael's fascinating with masks could be a wink and a nod to the atrocious "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AOX09">Halloween III - Season Of The Witch</a>").  Not that Laurie ever makes it to the hospital, but in the end it come to the siblings.  That sounds like a lot, to condense two movies and add a whole new first act, but once Zombie gets to Halloween present he concentrates on hitting the highlights from the original and throwing in plenty of echoes from the originals: "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009NHC0">The Thing from Another World</a>" is still playing on the television and "Mr. Sandman" is still being sung.<br /><br />Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at Zombie's strategy in making this film.  On the one hand he sticks to the unforgettable music of Carpenter's original score, but on the other he avoids going head to head with that movie's iconic scene when Laurie finds the tableau display of Annie's corpse.  I also have to say there was a lot less blood and gore than I would have suspected given Zombie's previous cinematic efforts (e.g., "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AXWHSA">The Devil's Rejects</a>"), but there is a concerted effort here to be more in the style of the original and it is nice to be reminded that a good door slam can be more terrorizing that a geyser of blood.  It is for that slight change in sensibilities, plus all the nifty DVD extras, that lead me to round up on this one.  It goes without saying that the remake does not surpass the original--which stands out in our memories because for most of us it was the first time we saw the killer keep getting up again and again--but no one ever thinks that is going to be the case, so when that turns out to be the case it is not a surprise.  Just do not be surprised when you finish watch this remake that you do not feel the urge to go back and enjoy the original yet again.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>This is a decent remake, no where near as good as carpenters Halloween movies but none the less a decent film.  Carpenter's Halloween is a 5 star film, this remake however is not even in that class.  I am a Huge Halloween fan, I just didn't feel like this wa a true Halloween Michael Myers film.  This remake is no where near as good as the TCM remake, but over all it's a decent popcorn movie at 3 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XQ48481DIO80.html">A2XQ48481DIO80</a><br/><p>i must say...........im not a big fan of the halloween movies,but this movie really was good to me! im just waiting for rob zombie to make part two!</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>It's hard to recommend this new version of Halloween because it's brutal and disturbing but well acted and well made. The body count increased incredibly in this remake. I can't even count how many people died in the movie.<br /><br />  The movie is creepy and scary and despite how awfully violent it is I couldn't keep my eyes off it. I might need therapy for that reason though. This is probably the most insane movie I have seen, well next to Devil's Rejects anyway. Rob Zombie is a good director but.....the movie is a bit over done. We didn't need the body count to be even bigger this time around.<br /><br />  Seeing person after person die brutally tends to get tiresome and hard to watch and it even holds the movie down from being great. There's a little too many un-needed killings in the movie. Rob Zombie went all out when he really didn't have to. He loses focus on the main story by having sooo many side characters brutally murdered.<br /><br />  The movie is gripping especially at the end but the beginning drags on too long and is a bit depressing despite a creepy performance by the kid who plays young Michael. Sarah Moon also does good work as his mother and you feel bad for her since she clearly loves her child who broke her heart by going all psycho. Rob Zombie pulls off giving us a film that's a bit different, so if you are avoiding it because you feel as if you seen it already, don't avoid it for that reason. You might want to avoid it due to being so over the top violent though.</p></br><a href="../users/A37OOQQLMMKYR8.html">A37OOQQLMMKYR8</a><br/><p>This review is on the long side, but please just bare with me.<br /><br />Halloween just might be the most controversial horror remake of all time; when it was announced as a remake with Rob Zombie directing a lot of people were for it and a lot of people were against it. While I wasn't happy Halloween was being remade I also looked forward to it. I feel the last couple of installments were rather weak. Even though I do enjoy 2-5, it's all been downhill after the classic original. Also being a fan of Rob Zombie got me interested.<br /><br />The series though needed something to get back on track and I hoped this would be the movie to get things going. I know a lot of people were upset that the series wouldn't get closure now. But does it really matter? This series has so many loose ends to begin with. The unfairly bashed Halloween 3 has nothing to do with the previous 2 or anything afterwards so that will never be wrapped up. Halloween 4-6 were ignored come H20 and Resurrection. So no matter what this series would never get closure. And honestly after Halloween: Resurrection this franchise was in much need of a resurrection.<br /><br />Adding a back-story is something that can be very tough to work and that is what really made me nervous and when I heard it was the first half of the movie I got even more nervous. This may be a remake, but let's face it most people will still see this as the 9th Halloween movie. The funny thing is I happen to think the first half was the strongest of the movie and I know a lot of people felt that way. Even those who hated the movie, a lot of the times say the first half was better. The backstory here is far, far better than the lame curse of thorn. The first half was an interesting character study of a very disturbed boy.<br /><br />The screenplay by Rob Zombie was very uneven; most of his ideas play out well, but there are some cringe worthy moments. The first 10-minutes or so features some weak writing. But as a fan of this genre the writing is often the weakest part and none of the Halloween movies had great screenplays. Yes even the original; the script really wasn't all that great. The reason Halloween is the masterpiece it is, is simply because of the strong lead performances and Carpenter's directing and music. In Halloween 07 most of the poor dialogue is from Ronnie White played by the very cool William Forsythe. His dialogue is terrible and his performance is border-line of a parody. His character is entertaining, but the biggest flaw with the first half. But the good is any scene with Dr. Loomis played by Malcolm McDowell and young Michael played by Daeg Faerch. Also the scenes withy young Michael and Deborah Myers played by Sheri Moon Zombie also works very well.<br /><br />The Loomis and Michael scenes actually come out well, and it was quite interesting to see Loomis actually trying to reach Michael and help him. In the original we never see Loomis working with young Michael, which is fine. That wasn't the point of the original, but it is interesting seeing Loomis trying to reach Michael. I found their relationship the strongest part of Halloween 07. In the original as well as the sequels Loomis is out to stop Michael no matter what. Even if it means giving his own life; when Loomis first comes across Michael at the end in the original his first reaction was shoot to kill. In Halloween 07 Loomis though tries to reach Michael first and if that doesn't work than shoot to kill. The scenes with Loomis and Michael are well written and acted and play out very well overall. Daeg Faerch does an excellent job as young Michael.<br /><br />Some people dislike the backstory, but it was for the most part well done some people disliked the fact Michael was given a motive. I don't think that was the case. Michael was a disturbed boy who was bound to snap sooner or later. His home life just made him snap sooner. But the things he does as a child and later as an adult isn't something people do unless they are very disturbed.<br /><br />The first half actually works well despite some weak writing at times; the performances were mostly good with Sheri Moon Zombie being the stand-out; I do think Zombie has a slight problem writing for normal characters, but he does a great job with Deborah Myers. She was likeable and very sympathetic. I do think though the screenplay could have used a touch up in the first half, but Zombie keeps the pace moving at a solid pace and makes up for any shortcomings.<br /><br />The problem with the 2nd half is basically 80-minutes of the original crammed into about an hour. The pacing is the biggest problem; characters are introduced for a scene or two and are killed off right away. There is very little getting to know them. There are moments where it does sort of become a rehash of the original, but it still works well. No doubt it's not as suspenseful and scary as the original, but Zombie's scenes do work well overall.<br /><br />With Halloween, the problem of writing for normal characters is still there for Zombie. None of the characters were really all that likeable outside of maybe Ismael Cruz played by Danny Trejo. The Strode family was Rob's attempt at writing normal characters, but the problem is they come across as really weird. It's like those people who get older, but yet try and act like they are down with the youth they always seem weird. Pat Skipper does a good job as Mason Strode as does Dee Wallace as Cynthia. Both characters are likeable though, but just come across as a little weird. Their deaths though are very brutal and work really well.<br /><br />Scout Taylor-Compton does an excellent job as Laurie Strode, but her character was just not fully developed, but than again the point of Halloween 07 was to focus more on Michael Myers. It was his story where as the original was Laurie's story. Scout gets some heat, but she was one of the bright spots of the movie. Some people say she wasn't likeable and was too mean to Tommy Doyal played by Skyler Gisondo. I have to disagree; the scenes with her and Tommy and than later with Lindsey played by Jenny Gregg Stewart are the strongest scenes in the 2nd half. She wasn't being mean to them they have brother/sister kind of relationship and it worked quite well. Zombie is getting better at writing for normal characters. His first two were all about the villains, and here the main focus is the villain, but he does do better with the normal characters, than he did in Corpses and Rejects. But The Devil's Rejects is still by far his best movie thus far.<br /><br />By the time Laurie enters the movie there is about an hour left and there was no way all these characters plus Laurie could be fully developed without slowing down the pace. This Laurie isn't the repressed virgin Jamie Lee's Laurie was. Scout's Laurie was a nice girl with an edge to her. But her first scene was very weird and that shows Zombie needs more work on normal characters. By the time Laurie came into play developing her too much would have slowed the pace down a lot. And at this point you gotta keep moving forward. There was potential with the Laurie character, but despite not being fully developed I do think the character was likeable.<br /><br />Some people complain about the lack of screen time for Lynda played by Kristina Klebe and Annie played by Danielle Harris making her big return to the Halloween series. If you go back and view the original Halloween, Lynda actually doesn't have a lot of screen time. Difference is her part is spread out more through the picture, where as here it's not. Though it does seem like Annie may have had less screen time than the original Annie did; both girls though play their roles well. They weren't all that likeable in general, but they both provide solid performances.<br /><br />I think the writing for Laurie, Lynda and Annie was good and bad. They do come across like teenagers in the things they say and do. Not all teens are like that, but a lot of them are. But they just lacked depth. But as much as I love the original there was some weak writing and Lynda had the weakest of lines. Lynda in the remake is no more developed, but in some ways she actually is. Prior to her death when she talks to Laurie on the phone does add a little bit of depth to Lynda. Her tough girl act is just that an act. Zombie's screenplay was very mixed, but there is some potential there for him as a writer with normal characters.<br /><br />Tyler Mane I thought did a great job as Michael Myers. To be honest I would rate him 2nd to only Nick Castle of the original. If the original Michael was the incarnation of evil, this Michael is the incarnation of rage. Despite his size he's still stealthy. The scene when he stands behind Lindsey Wallace as she watches TV is a very creepy moment. Tyler's Michael and Nick Castle's Michael are very much a like, but very different. But I really loved Tyler's performance.<br /><br />The good and bad of the backstory is simple. We get to know Michael so well it does sort of take away the boogeyman element. But it also brings a human side to Michael and makes him feel so much more real. I'll admit the 2nd half had some creepy moments thanks to Tyler's movements and the fact we knew Michael more makes him seem real. In the sequels he became too much of an un-killable monster. Like the original, this is the most human Michael has ever been. In the original Michael was just pure evil, he was the shape of evil in a man. But he felt like a real person. And while he kept coming back an excuse can be made for why he survived what he did. Zombie goes back to that in a sense. Again this is the most human Michael has been in a while.<br /><br />What I liked about Tyler Mane was his eyes show nothing. And what I mean by that they show no remorse. He has this empty look. The person inside of him is dead and just evil has taken over his body. Having such a big Michael may not have been the smartest move, but it works out great as Tyler Mane gives it his all and makes a great Michael. Malcolm McDowell was excellent as Dr. Loomis, though nobody can ever top Pleasence. My only problem with McDowell is sometimes he comes across as a bit shady. The major problem is a lot of his scenes in the 2nd half with Brad Dourif as Sheriff Brackett is a rehash of the original just worded slightly different.<br /><br />Some people complain about the violence, but I thought it was done in a great way. The one thing Rob Zombie really has going for him as a filmmaker is he knows how to shoot a brutal death scene. His love of exploitation cinema serves him well with the deaths. The victims try and fight back and put more of a struggle up. The scene with Michael dragging away a topless Annie is a very creepy moment. And when Laurie finds her later on it's actually quite chilling. This is probably the most violent Halloween, but it does work well since it's very raw and real. As a director despite some pacing problems Rob Zombie is able to keep things moving forward and like him or not there was a story and I personally enjoyed it.<br /><br />Not everybody will like this flick, but I can't help but feel a lot of the hate stems from it being a remake. I saw a lot of negative reviews from people who never even have seen this and I read a lot of negative stuff before the movie was even shot. Liking the remake doesn't make you any less of a fan of the original and Halloween 07 will never replace the original. I don't get that so many people are willing to accept the sequels, but dismiss the remake before even viewing it.<br /><br />Make no mistake Halloween 07 isn't a perfect film and not as good as the original. But it does deliver some suspense and scares. I would rate Halloween 07 as the 2nd best of the series only behind the original. I didn't like Halloween 07 at first, but now I've come to love it. Give it a chance and just forget it's a remake and enjoy the ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M1N8G4W4END8.html">A2M1N8G4W4END8</a><br/><p>Rob Zombie's remake of John Carpenter's legendary and classic horror film HALLOWEEN (1978) is absolutely outstanding.  Remaining basically loyal to the original and tampering with the basic plot in only minor ways, Zombie's contribution is to provide a back story to the famous serial killer that simultaneously makes him more human and more unnatural...and therefore much scarier!<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Unrated Director's Cut on DVD is not the same film that was offered to horror fans in theaters. More than just added footage that had to be cut in order to receive an "R" rating by the MPAA, this Unrated edition actually contains alternate scenes that replace the theatrical ones and, in many ways, make the offering a totally different film. Unfortunately, the alternate scene on the DVD that explains how Michael Myers escapes from the sanitarium is much weaker than the one used in the theatrical version, and it therefore makes the film on this DVD a much weaker flick. Alas, the original scene is not even included as an extra on the disk and is missing altogether, and a few fans that missed the film in the theater run don't realize they are watching a different film.<br /><br />Rob Zombie deserves the kudos he's been getting for creating a fantastic new vision with his remake, but sadly the film for which he earned those kudos is not the one on the Unrated Director's Cut DVD.  Zombie should be chastised NOT delivering that great remake to his fans for home viewing.<br /><br />The four-star rating is for this DVD, not the real film fans saw in theaters last fall.  Alas, Zombie's true work of art is currently only offered in the vsiually butchered 1.33:1 Wal-Mart Trailer-trash version, but fans won't find it on the Unrated Director's Cut.  Fans who want to revisit the great vision they saw in theaters can only hope that it will someday be released on DVD in widescreen...perhaps as a part of some ultimate edition package.</p></br></body></html>

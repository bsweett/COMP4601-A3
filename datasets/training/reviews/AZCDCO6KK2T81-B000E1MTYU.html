<meta name="summary" content="Awesome Popcorn Entertainment"></head><body><p>A great continuation to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305079900">The Terminator</a> franchise.  I was wonderfully surprised at how skillfully this film was made without James (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JLWW">Titanic</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008G8LY">The Abyss</a>) Cameron at the helm of it all.  Jonathan Mostow who gave us the fabulously instense <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005B9UZ">U-571</a> directs this film with great flare, deftness, and respect for the franchise.  The script is also respectful of its predecessors and doesn't contradict them a la "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LRZHQO">The Grudge 2</a>."<br /><br />The acting is all first-rate for this kind of film and Kristanna Loken is a real find as the "Terminatrix."  The effects, sound, editing, and action sequences are top-notch and should be at $172 million.  BTW: It may have cost a bundle to make, but it earned nearly 1/2 billion at the box-office.  When you consider that this is the third trip to the well, that's not bad at all.<br /><br />This is definitely Schwarzenegger's swansong as the terminator as he began his political career shortly after this film's release; nevertheless, he continues to fit the part perfectly and even brings a certain amount of depth to the role this time around as he had done in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009QG68">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a>.  He is actually a better actor than he is often given credit for being.  He certainly doesn't look his 55 years in this film and his stature continues to intimidate.  He will be greatly missed in this role and on the silver screen as he now focuses on his political career.  What a life he has lead: world-class body builder, world-wide box-office smash actor, and now respected politician.  There is definitely great intelligence and strong-willed spirit with the brawn.<br /><br />While this is just popcorn fun, there is depth to this latest entry into the franchise as we and the characters discover that Judgment Day wasn't stopped, just postponed.  The story is exciting and suspenseful, but meaningful and touching too.  The ending sequence is actually moving and haunting.<br /><br />Rumor has it that Terminator 4 is being made where we finally live in the "future" time that we only saw in snipets in the prior films.  If it is made by the same folks who did T3, I will definitely wait in line for tickets.  I miss James Cameron's specific vision, but the folks behind T3 have a solid vision of their own and it's respectful to Cameron's at the same time.<br /><br />Finally, this two-disc "special edition" is worth the price to get all the behind the scenes info.</p></body></html>

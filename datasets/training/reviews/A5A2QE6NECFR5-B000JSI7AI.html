Worth seeing once, it is an honorable effort to portray the power of forbidden love between two modern-day cowboys who would obviously vote Republican on all but gay issues, and perhaps even on some of those. Now that the film is a couple of years old, I think it is safe to reveal that one of the leads does not survive the film. That was the most disappointing part...we come to care about the men, yet one passes from this world with only the briefest of depictions. I was surprised it did not win the Oscar as best film, but the awards were given out before I saw the movie. Now that I have seen it, I think it can be fairly called one of the ten best films of its year, and one of the three most talked about, but not deserving of the top honor for its season. Good performances for sure, but the script could have used some trimming and some punch.</p></body></html>

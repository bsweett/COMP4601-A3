<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful to look at but not much going on"></head><body><p>I understand and appreciate the artistry of Terrance Mallick but he can be a very flawed director.<br /><br />This could have been an amazing movie with an all too familiar story (adoption by a tribe, think "Avatar" or "Dances with Wolves") but Mallick did too much with the cinematography and not enough with narration. Mallick also gets too enchanted with having his film express a poetic effect rather than having his film express story telling.<br /><br />This is the simple story of 17th century English explorers coming to North America and clashing with the native Indians. Instead of gloriying and putting an unrealistic sheen on that era, Mallick effectively depicts that in now way/ no how was it similar to how we live today. The native Americans are apparently civilized yet also very savage. The English appear civilized, but, in reality. much more savage than the Indians. The English bring with them disease and nothing is easy about living off of the land. Great premise but some real problems with the execution.<br /><br />Mallick improperly lets the camera do too much talking when he should pay more attention to dialog and narrative. He uses weird voice overs and does not properly segue when advancing time.<br /><br />Collin Farrell is an ostrocized English explorer that falls for the Indian Pochahantas. In between there are conflicts between the two groups from where these protagonists emenated from.<br /><br />There are battle scenes that should have been fantastic but they are confusing and do not advance the story. There is a seemingly beautiful blossoming of a relationship, yet the director explores it, backs off from it and does away with it. The English may appear more adorned but a close up of them make them look more barbaric than their Indian counterparts. There should have been fascinating nautical scenes yet, they are too much bypassed.<br /><br />Eventually Pochahantas is excommunicated from her tribe, is forced to live with the colonists and moves to England. That is where this film really goes sour.  I'm neither the smartest nor the dumbest guy, but it is really hard to tell what is going on, what the director's objectives were and what the point of the movie is in the last hour of this movie. The first part of this movie is Colonists enamored with this strange land, their conflicts with the Indians and a different perspective from the Indian's point of view. That could be pretty interesting and entertaining. The second half is quite boring.<br /><br />What distinguishes Mallick from other directors, how beautiful and etheral his films look like is the same thing that detracts it. His style comes across too pretentious when there is no need. A more straightforward, organic approach would have fortified the film. I saw "The Tree of Life" and loved Mallick's approach but that had a lot to do with the subject matter. This is practically a "cowboys and indians" flick, and the arty nature is inconsistent with the subject matter.<br /><br />Artistic directorial restraint, cutting back on it's length and remembering that a movie is supposed to entertain could have made this a whole lot better of a movie.</p></body></html>

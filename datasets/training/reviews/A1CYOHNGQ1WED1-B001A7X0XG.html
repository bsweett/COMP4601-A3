What plot there is is so convoluted when you unpack it you won't care because it's contrived and unoriginal. The acting is terrible. Then again, the only thing worse is the dialog the actors are forced to say. All fight scenes in movies are choreographed but the good ones are seamless so you can't tell. The fight scenes in Ultraviolet are a ballet with every move telegraphed so you never believe any of it for a second. I'm sure a lot of money was wasted making this film as was the money I spent to watch it. If you want to watch Milla Jovovich rent The Fifth Element or The Messenger.</p></body></html>

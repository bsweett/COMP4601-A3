Really if somehow you're reading this and haven't seen the Thing close out of this and just watch it right now. The Thing is a horror movie stripped down from all the BS cliches that most horror movies at the time and even now are bogged down by. People like to think Alien is the best sci-fi horror movie but you have no scenes in the Thing where there is some idiot chasing a cat down a dark hallway, none of that crap in the Thing.<br /><br />The start for the Thing is fairly slow, the film opens up in the empty Anartic tundra when a lone helicopter fades into view, chasing a dog while shooting at it. Not something you see everyday. The dog eventually runs into an American outpost where the Norweigens promptly follow, guns blazing on a hell bent mission to kill the dog. One of them accidently grazes one of the American's and promptly gets shot dead on the spot, leaving the American's with a destroyed helicopter and this dog. From here on out the American's do some investigating to see just what the hell happened and why, while the dog is free to roam around the camp.<br /><br />What The Thing establishes better than any film ever is a stifling sense of dread and paranoia, and when you actually see the Thing it is easily the greatest horror monster ever, Frankenstein, Dracula, Leatherface, Freddy, etc, eat your hearts out! It's such an ingenious design where you are shown a lot and yet you know very little about the Thing, it's origin, just how it got those ghastly shapes, etc, and like any good film it leaves the details up to your imagination. The other great aspect about it is that it can perfectly imitate anyone it kills, basically it's a much grislier version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and it can emote like us, sure there's a way to find out who's human but it takes quite some time to figure that out for the Americans.<br /><br />The pacing is perfect, at first everyone is mildly curious and confused at the Norweigen encounter early in the film, then when they discover just what the deformed corpse at the Norwegian camp is capabale of the scientists of the crew grow concerned (to say to the least for Blair), until finally everyone see's an incomplete Bennings contorting in the snow, then everyone is watching each other like a hawk and very skeptical of each other, tired and confused pointing fingers and making mistakes. This is where the sense of dread comes in, the whole atomosphere is so well established and maintained that this, more so than the monster, is what makes the Thing such an excellent horror film.<br /><br />The acting is perfect as well, unlike the Hollywoodized remake where Mary Elizabeth Winstead is the only person to basically make every decision, everyone in John Carpenter's weighs in on the situation and butt heads and form groups to oppose another's ideas. All of the actors are uniformly good, since there are so many of them none of them are really fleshed out but you get an idea of their different personalities, from the cold calculationg Blair to the wise-ass stoner Palmer, they all have a certain charm that distinguishes them from each other instead of just looking and acting like clones.<br /><br />The technical work is also phenominal, the sense of claustrophobia is well punctuated by the Anarctic blizzard that's going on for most of the movie, and it gives you a sense that you're stuck in a sardine can with a monster, the question is who? The establishing shots in the beginning showing the Anarctic are simply breathtaking, and the close up shots really emphasize each character's subtle reactions to the circumstances. The monster FX despite the final Thing looking like an obvious clay-model, the whole ambition and pay off is incredible, the Thing guarantees you'll see stuff you've never imagined before.<br /><br />Very, very few films in my opinion are five stars, but The Thing is goddamn perfect in every regard, the sheer ambition of it all and the fact that it all pays off well, The Thing is the crowning achievement of the 80's horror movies and set a high standard that horror movies (and movies in general) come nowhere close to. A must if you're a fan of horror, who-dun-it's, and air tight scripts, and don't mind disturbing graphic violence than you can't do any better than The Thing.</p></body></html>

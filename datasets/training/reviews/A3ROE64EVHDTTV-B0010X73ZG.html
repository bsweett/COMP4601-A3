<meta name="summary" content="Brutal Monstrosity!"></head><body><p>The Good Things:<br />*This set includes both the original color version and the black-and-white version.<br />*Both versions of the film have pretty good video quality.  It is sharp, has good color, and for the b/w version, has high contrast.  However, it does have a fair amount of grain to it (could be bad if you're expecting a crystal-clear transfer; could be good because it adds to the visceral nature of the film).<br />*Contains deleted scenes, several fascinating featurettes, webisodes, and trailers (same stuff as from the 2-disc DVD set).  It's all contained on disc one.  Disc two has only the black-and-white version of the movie (with an introduction).<br />*The movie itself seems to be influenced by HP Lovecraft; the monsters are all otherworldly bugs and shapeless monsters. Definitely some of the freakiest monsters ever put on the screen.<br />*Also, special effects are pretty good.  Maybe not the best, but better than most other Stephen King based movies.<br />*There are only a few bad scenes of violence, but they are exceptionally brutal and quite scary!<br />*Even scarier than the monsters are the people. Most of the movie focuses on how everybody reacts to the situation, and there are many mixed and wild reactions. Many people act dumb and irrationaly, and few are sensible. This makes for very realistic and intense drama.<br />*As a whole, it is a deep, brutal exploration of human nature in an extreme apocalyptic situation. The whole film is very thought-provoking.<br />*Most of the story is close to the original novella by Stephen King; only the ending is different (see below).<br />*It's not as corny or cliched as some of the other Stephen King works.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*The ending was exceptionally brutal, and can be seen as either good or bad. I think it could have had a happier ending, but as it is in the film, it does leave you thinking and feeling bitter.<br />*On the minus side, the ending is radically different from the original novella.<br />*Sometimes, you just want to punch these stupid characters in the face (then again, this could be a good thing too, because the drama really absorbs the audience).<br /><br />This definitely goes above and beyond my expectations. It's not the typical horror flick; it's an intense thought-provoking study of people under pressure. The result is explosive, and unfortunately, highly believable. Even though it is stylistically similar to "Dreamcatcher," or "The Thing," it is more akin to "Children of Men" or "Pan's Labyrinth." Because of this, it is frightening on all levels, and I would consider this to be one of the best Stephen King-inspired films ever made.</p></body></html>

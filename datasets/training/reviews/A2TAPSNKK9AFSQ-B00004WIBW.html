<meta name="summary" content="Another Masterpiece From Mr. Tim Burton!!!"></head><body><p>This movie is set in the the late 1700's where a series of murders have occurred in the small town of Sleepy Hollow. Ichabod Crane , played very well by Johnny Depp is a forerunner to modern Forensic Science as he goes to investigate the killings. The camera work and lighting is  suburb is this movie and this is one film that you should watch on the big screen. Mr. Burton manages to capture the mood and the eerieness of the era  with uncanny and unsettling accuracy.  Christina Ricci also gives an excellent performance in this film as the mysterious girl who may or may not be hiding a secret. Well done , Mr. Burton!!!</p></body></html>

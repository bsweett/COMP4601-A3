He suffers from thirst and hunger, wears rags and sleeps in ruins and other fortune hideouts. He must protect himself from the deadly blazing sun during the day and a not less deadly cold at night. He is lonely, as he crosses few people on the road - and amongst those he meets, most are thieves, bandits, madmen and cannibals. Although not yet old, he is not a young man anymore and his strength slowly abandons him. Scars and burns cover his skin, the stigmata of his personal Via Dolorosa. And he can not stop as he carries a heavy burden, and he would rather die than abandon it, as he must bring it to a safe place - which he didn't find yet. His name is Eli (Denzel Washington) and he has been walking like that for the last thirty years...<br /><br />"The book of Eli", as one of the previous reviewers mentioned, is basically a mixture of "Mad Max 2" and "The Road", but with one very special element which distinguishes it from all other post-apocalyptic movies I saw - a very powerful Christian message. Because the burden Eli carries is the last Bible that exists in this devastated world. And two perils threaten this treasure - that it is destroyed, or even worse, that it fells into wrong hands...<br /><br />The wrong hands in this story belong to a certain Carnegie (Gary Oldman), a ruthless, cruel, but cunning and ambitious man, who rules tyrannically over the only "town" lost in the middle of desolation. His power is based mainly on the control of the only source of clean water in his vast domain. He used his power to gather a community in which people are protected from thirst, hunger and roaming cannibals - but where there is little freedom and where brutish thugs serving Carnegie are aristocracy, bulling the powerless plebeians. Carnegie wants to expand his domain and rise from a local boss to a king, but he is not certain if his little army can achieve that. He believes however, that if he owned a Bible and could preach its message to scattered remnants of humanity, he could become quite easily the supreme religious, political and military leader of a kingdom.<br /><br />The unavoidable confrontation between Eli and Carnegie includes some action scenes, but it is essentially spiritual and contains some very simple but powerful lessons. At one moment Eli recites the famous psalm 23: " The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death; I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever." And the whole movie is actually mostly an illustration of this prayer - a message of encouragement to the righteous.<br /><br />But there is also a warning for the wicked - even if you lay your hands on the greatest treasures of the Earth, soon they will turn to dust which will slip between your fingers... And the thing that I liked particularly in this movie, is that director and scenario writer decided, that the Almighty sometimes simply can not resist to play a particularly naughty, even vicious joke at the expense of the villains...)))<br /><br />Another great treasure of this movie is THE twist before the end, which changes completely the way we perceived EVERYTHING that happened before, a little like the revelation in the "Sixth sense" (but just to be precise, NO, it is not the same revelation!). This twist has its importance. I must humbly admit that in the beginning I was not thrilled by this film and I almost stopped watching it after 10 minutes - but I forced myself to continue and I was ultimately greatly rewarded. When the film was finished, I immediately rewatched it a second time, because once you know THE twist, the whole film is changed and it is really worthy to be seen again.<br /><br />Although this is mostly a Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman show, I also liked to see Jennifer Beals and Malcolm McDowell in smaller but important supporting roles. On another hand, Mila Kunis, although quite present on the screen, is not allowed to play a lot, as her character is there mainly to give Eli an occasion to speak and let us know a little about him and his story. It is not very fair for her, but she plays this auxilliary role with grace.<br /><br />Finally, I must admit that being a Christian I may not be entirely objective when reviewing this film and OK, maybe I liked it a little bit more than it desserves. But still, it made quite an impression on me and I can not give it anything less than five stars - and the final message of "The book of Eli", which is also the title of this review, taken from the New Testament, is splendid and a very powerful one.</p></body></html>

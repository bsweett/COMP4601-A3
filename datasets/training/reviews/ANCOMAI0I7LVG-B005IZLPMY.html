<meta name="summary" content="Captain America's first half is far better than his second..."></head><body><p>I want to say this.  I am firmly convinced that Chris Evans IS a super hero.  Sadly, he isn't much of an actor, and it shows in this film.  He just isn't convincing as a person, constantly displaced from the people around him (especially the stunning Hayley Atwell, who can actually act her butt off here).  Honestly though, Chris Evans is the least of this film's problems.<br /><br />`Captain America: The First Avenger' suffers from trying to do too much without placing it firmly in focus.  It opens VERY strong, establishing young sickly Steve Rogers' backstory very well.  As an origin story, this film gets it and it works it beautifully.  This is aided by the beautiful production design, recreating an era and a place that consumes every frame.  From the costumes to the set pieces to the brilliantly cloaked cinematography, `Captain America' promises to be amazing.  Sadly, after Steve Rogers makes his transformation and his first heroic act the film loses its footing.  This comes from rapid segments that feel like an excuse to show pointless action sequences.  There is no meat in these scenes.  Secondly, the reveal of Hugo Weaving's villain seems kind of anticlimactic (why does he wait so long to show his comrades something he doesn't seem so intent of hiding anyways).  All of these elements create a second half that drags pretty badly.  The film wares out its welcome before it is half over.<br /><br />Still, some of the scenes are expertly crafted, and the technical elements at play here are nicely composed (making Chris Evans a scrawny little twig of a man is not only mind-blowing but believable) but in the end, this is a film that only `half' works.  I just wish they had stopped while they were ahead.</p></body></html>

Stephen Chow wrote and directed this film and I have to say that this is awesome! He is sure to be the next big martial arts star of Hollywood. The script is your typical Kung Fu story, but the fight scenes are excellent and I can't say enough and the fantastic special effects. The Lion Scream, The Buddhist Palm, I could just go on and on, this film is amazing.<br /><br />My personal favorite scene of the movie is when the kung fu masters fight the two assassins that play their instruments while tossing swords at their opponents. I have never seen anything like that in my life on a movie; the best part! Worth seeing the movie just for that battle sequence alone! If you love martial arts/kung fu movies this is for you!!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bug attack!"></head><body><p>"Starship Troopers," directed by Paul Verhoeven, is based on the novel of the same title by Robert Heinlein. While the film differs to a significant degree from the book, I find Verhoeven's version to be a thoroughly exciting and enjoyable piece of science fiction adventure.<p>"Troopers" takes place in a future in which humanity is waging an interplanetary war against an extraterrestrial collective of insectoid creatures. The film focuses on the personal journey of Johnny Rico (played by Casper Van Dien). We follow him from high school graduation to enlistment in the space infantry to combat against Earth's alien enemies. So "Troopers" is as much coming-of-age film as sci-fi adventure.<p>"Troopers" works well as a straightforward sci-fi adventure, but the filmmakers have also woven a lot of satirical material into the film. The result is a film with an odd vibe: should we be more fearful of the "bug" aliens or of Earth's own government? Incorporated into the story are bits of futuristic newscasts and propaganda.<p>Van Dien and the superb supporting cast play their roles with sincerity and enthusiasm, so regardless of the film's satiric thrust, the viewers wind up with heroes whom we can really cheer for. There is a great chemistry among the youthful ensemble of troopers, and tough guy Michael Ironside has a fine role as an older mentor figure.<p>The special effects and action sequences are top notch; the filmmakers have shown an amazing attention to detail in realizing this future world. The insectoid aliens, who come in a variety of forms, are very impressive. The whole thing is presented with great visual flair, and is superbly complemented by Basil Poledouris' thrillingly bombastic musical score. And while the outrageous gore and violence of some sequences may be too much for some viewers, I found this material to be well integrated into the overall cinematic vision. "Starship Troopers" is a sci-fi epic that definitely packs a punch.</p></body></html>

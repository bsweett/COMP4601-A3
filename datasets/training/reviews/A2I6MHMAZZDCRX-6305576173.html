He's even gone so far as to insist that his last name is pronounced Fronkensteen.  But his career as a neurosurgeon comes to a quick stop when he is informed he has just inherited the family manor in Transylvania.<br /><br />Traveling there, he meets up with new lab assistant Inga (Teri Garr) and Igor (Marty Feldman).  By the way, that last one is pronounced Eyegore, in case you were wondering.  But it's Frau Blucher (Cloris Leachman) who gives everyone a bad fright, even the horses.<br /><br />Slowly, Frederick begins to discover his grandfather's secrets.  Unable to resist the pull of destiny, he creates his own Monster (Peter Boyle).  Will history repeat itself?<br /><br />I find Mel Brooks films to be hit and miss, usually in the same film.  Parts are funny, and parts are just okay.  That was certainly the case here.  There were several running gags I really enjoyed, and a few of the scenes had me laughing pretty hard.  But there were long stretches where I wasn't laughing.  And, frankly, I kept trying to understand what some scenes were doing in the film.  That's probably my own fault for not watching the films Mel was spoofing first.<br /><br />Now I knew going into the movie that there were be plenty of double entendres.  And I didn't care for them that much.  But by far the worst part of the film for me was the rape.  It was supposed to be played for laughs, but I found it and the after math downright offensive, especially since they were supposed to be funny.<br /><br />Even though there were parts I enjoyed, I won't be seeing this film again.</p></body></html>

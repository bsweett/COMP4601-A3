The result is a delightful film in which private investigator  Sam Spade (Bogart) attempts to answer a series of questions which somehow seem much more important to him than they do to those who see this film. The screenplay is based on one of Hammett's novels and was written by John Huston. This is also the first film Huston directed. He and Bogart worked together on four other classics: Key Largo  and The Treasure of Sierra Madre (both released in 1948), The African Queen (1951), and Beat the Devil (1953). If anything, I find this film even more amusing now than I did when I first saw it. How about the names of the characters? Miss Wonderly/Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Astor), Joel Cairo (Lorre), and Kaspar Gutman (Greenstreet). Someone's tongue was firmly in the nearest cheek. The plot makes little (if any) sense but who cares? The film's greatness is explained by the consistently superior acting and by the dialogue which never loses its Snap! Crackle! and Pop! To his great credit, amidst all the harmless nonsense, Bogart maintains his gravitas. He seems genuinely interested in "getting to the truth" to explain why his partner was murdered, why the Maltese Falcon is so valuable, etc. We tag along so as not to miss any of his interactions with a truly colorful cast of characters. Yes, that's Elisha Cook, Jr. in the role of Wilmer Cook. (No relation.) And yes, that's Huston's father Walter as Captain Jacobi. If you have not already seen it, why wait? If you have, see it again. Somehow it gets better and better, time after time, year after year after year.</p></body></html>

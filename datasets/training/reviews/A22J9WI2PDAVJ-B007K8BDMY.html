<meta name="summary" content="The man who tempts the grizzlies."></head><body><p>Werner Herzog (Director) puts this documentary into a visible masterpiece of a man gone awry. Timothy Treadwell's one hundred plus hours of video footage is condensed into a two hour storyline that borderlines schizophrenic.<br /><br />Werner Herzog combines interviews of friends, lovers, DNR employees and parents to try to make sense of a man and his obsession with grizzly bears. Timothy Treadwell spent thirteen years in the Alaska Katmai National Park and reserve observing and naming all of the grizzlies that he encounters. Some think that Timothy was acting out as a grizzly. He was acting and thinking like a grizzly in his eyes. The video gives insight into Timothy's modus vivendi.<br /><br />  The last five seasons he brought along a video camera. The grizzly video is visually remarkable.  The video of Timothy talking into the camera trying to convince the viewers to understand his love for the bears is like watching a man with a death wish. Towards the end of his death the video clearly shows his lost sense of reality. He really thinks that the grizzlies are his friends and not food.<br /><br />Every viewer clearly understands that these are wild animals. The video takes me back to the first "Blair Witch Project" when everyone thought it was real. I felt lucky that was not me in that video. Same of this one, but this video is REAL. And it shows how a man can lose his sense of reality. As seen through the lens of a camera.</p></body></html>

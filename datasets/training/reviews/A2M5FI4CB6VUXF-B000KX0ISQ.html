Freed from one bond of servitude, these men of color were chained to another bond of servitude, the U.S. Army. Battling for freedom and equality that was nothing if not weak and half-imaginary, these brave men fought valiantly to earn a previously-unsung spot in history.<br /><br />Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman lead a magnificent ensemble cast in a movie that is about more than just a war. It's about an epic struggle. A struggle between men, between races, between thoughts, between ideas, between societies and between past and future.<br /><br />The bravery of the men depicted in this movie should never again be forgotten. The unselfish sacrifice and the reward they were denied for so long should stand as a lesson for all time. They were given nothing though they were expected to give their all in the service of a country that hated them, that thought they were no more valuable than a horse, a mule or the dog sitting on the front porch.<br /><br />The courage and the humility is must have taken... it gives me shivers just thinking about it.</p></body></html>

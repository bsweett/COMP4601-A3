<meta name="summary" content="OLIVIER'S GHOST"></head><body><p>My first question:  why in the world did the producers and directors of this film decide to use the "ghost" of the great Sir Laurence Olivier in this movie?  It doesn't seem at all necessary and its cleverness merely elicits a scratch of the head from this reviewer.  Oh, well, guess they thought it would be "original?"<br /><br />Anyway, this film, a digital masterpiece, is a wonderful homage to the films of the 30s 40s and 50s, gorgeously colored and with awesome digital effects.  It is most definitely an eye candy movie, its acting and plot overshadowed by the sheer artistry of the special effects crew.  Suffice to say, Jude Law, Angelina Jolie and particularly Gwyneth Paltrow have never looked more beautiful or stunning.  Giovanni Ribisi is excellent as always in a smaller role, but the real star of the movie is its visionary director, Kerry Conran.  Although I wouldn't want to see a lot of movies filmed in this manner, one must admit the excellence and hard work that went behind it.</p></body></html>

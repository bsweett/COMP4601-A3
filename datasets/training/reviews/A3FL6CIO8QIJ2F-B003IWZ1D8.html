<meta name="summary" content=""Now This Is A True Classic""></head><body><p>Anthony Perkins became a household name after starring in Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho". Playing the mentally unbalanced momma's boy Norman Bates, Perkin's portrayal is both mesmerizing and haunting as he leaves the viewer enthralled with his vivid performance of one of the cinema's most complicated characters. Janet Leigh is also fantastic in this, although her character is killed off early in the film. Out of all of Hithcock's films "Psycho" is the best, with his other masterpiece "The Birds" coming in a close second.<br /> If you enjoy "Psycho" you will love the "Psycho" sequels and prequel that are available in one fabulous set: in it you get all three remaining "Psycho" films, "Psycho 2", "Psycho 3", and the prequel that was made for cable TV called appropriately "Psycho 4". There is also a remake of "Psycho" that is available individually starring Anne Heche and Julianne Moore, directed by Gus Vant Sant, that was released in the late '90's. Not up to par with the original, it is nevertheless entertaining.<br /> This particular set of "Psycho" is filled to the brim with bonuses, the best being an informative 90 minute documentary on the making of this Hollywood classic. One thing is certain after watching "Psycho": you will be nervous when taking a shower. Janet Leigh stated many years before her death that after filming wrapped she could never take a shower for the rest of her life.</p></body></html>

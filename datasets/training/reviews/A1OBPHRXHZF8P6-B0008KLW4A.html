This character did not recieve her due in the original theatrical release. <p>Until I saw previews for this abomination of a film. <p>Since Eartha Kitt played Catwoman for a stint in the Adam West-era Batman, I am not bothered by the ethnicity of the character. I am concerned about the apparent 360 of the plot. <p>Selina Kyle is supposed to be a lowly executive assistant who eventually snaps and fights back. Nothing I have seen indicates the production crew is reasonably going to live up to the earlier release. It honestly looks like Charmed with fur and a tail. <p>Halle Berry is a good actress, but I must wonder what made her sign on to this train wreck in waiting. Not even her star power will be able to bail out this disaster.</p></body></html>

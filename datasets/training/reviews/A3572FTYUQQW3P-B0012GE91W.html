<meta name="summary" content="A Good Summary of a BIG Book."></head><body><p>I am a grandfather who initially read Harry Potter to see what had captured the imagination of my grandchildren.  Rowling is an outstanding author and has created what in my opinion is a masterpiece.  I have now read all of the books and have seen all of the movies -- and I have enjoyed every one.  This latest film was a huge challenge to the screenwriter and director due to the sheer size of the book.  In this film we see Harry, Hermione, and Ron as near adults -- ready to graduate and certainly with much greater maturity and mastery of magic.  Certainly each movie gets darker and darker as do the books as Harry and friends encounter the growing evil of Valdemort.<br /><br />This was not the best of the series of films but it keeps the story moving.  The director has clearly elected to capture the essence of the story rather than to follow all of the details, which would have made an impossibly long movie.  However, for those who have never read the book, the movie moves along well.  For those who have read the book, they can fill in the details without having to see them on the screen.  The result is many of the major characters have relatively small parts in this movie.  In fact outside of Harry, Ron, and Hermione virtually all of the characters have small parts -- still the story moves along very well and you don't see the time pass.  I really liked the movie, I highly recommend it, it is probably not a movie for very young children because it shows the characters in some dangerous and threatening situations.  I only gave 4 stars because it is an abreviated version of the story -- but still well done.</p></body></html>

The Vampires and Werewolves "at each others necks" for so many generations instead of letting bygones be bygones, teaming up and feeding on us mere mortals...I mean...how silly.<br /><br />Well I guess it's a good thing for us though, no? And without the war there would have been no action-packed thriller about this war called Underworld.<br /><br />The effects are great in this flick. There's suspense. The DVD comes in a brilliant HD transfer with terrific 5.1 sound. What more could one ask for? How about a sequel/prequel?...Due out about a week from this writing....Hence, my decision to do this belated review.<br /><br />This DVD documents a war that has been raging between the Vampires and Lycans for years all because one of the Vampire leaders didn't want his Vampire daughter marrying a Wolfman several centuries back. Flash back to the present and Kate Beckinsale is a death dealer/Vampire that hunts the last of the Lycan. Scott Speedman is a mortal (for now) that holds the key to end the war, and he takes some licks (and a couple bites...key words: a couple) protecting that key.<br /><br />All in all a very well done story that will likely spawn many more modern day Vampire versus Werewolf movies to come...like Van Helsing, and, oh, the sequel!...Underworld: Evolution!<br /><br />The sequel holds much promise actually. All of the key characters are back played by the same actors...with the same director. That's the first ingredient to a successful sequel (looks like kind of a prequel too).<br /><br />Underworld: Evolution apparently continues the story of the war between the Death Dealing Vampires and The Howling, and also traces the beginnings of the fight between the two mythical, legendary monsters. But that'll have to be another review entirely.<br /><br />So if you've not already, get Underworld into your collection, or at least view it before seeing the next installment. It's definitely a keeper for those into the genre.</p></body></html>

He should be so proud, but alas, if theres one thing that prison has tought him it's that he was there for a reason...he was wrong.  This film has so much heart and soul it's a shame that there are still those who don't see it for what it really is.  You have a man who knows only one way to feel, and due to experiences in his life he feels he is justified, and throughout the movie, while listening to Derrik rant and rave you will start to see where he's coming from.  It may be scary to admitt, but then again it's not when you see the life he lived and the adverse effects childhood trauma can have on someone, regardless of rights and wrongs.  It's like when a man, abused relentlessly by his father turns around and abuses another child.  There's no justifying the crime, it's WRONG, but you can start to break down the reason's as to why.  That's what this film does, it breaks down the reasons as to WHY there is so much hate today and why people feel the way they do.  The key to this film is that you can't blame the world for what one person has done...and you can't blame a race for the jack@$$ decitions of a few.  Derrik realizes this after spending his time in prison, realizing that there is good and bad in all races, even whites, and that you can't hold a nametag over the heads of every minority you see just because the ones you know are @$$holes...It's a timely lession because we all do it.  Stereotypes are so common that he blacks will make comments in regards to there own stereotypes and whites will do the same.  We all cast judgment because of a few instances and thus make it harder for each coming generation to make there own choice as to how to feel.  We are molding our youths to feel the hatred we keep inside by the comments we make under our breath or the jokes we make when in mixed company.  EVERYONE does it, but what this movie does so well at showing is the HORRID outcome that can happen if we don't learn as a society to accept one another.  We should not hate a race but hate an action.  Don't hate every african-american because the ones on your street seel crack and gang beat your brother...don't hate whites because your brother was harrased at school by the class racist...There is good in bad in every race, culture, religion...you name it it's there...but the bottom line is that with the bad there is the good and we as humans only have to dig so far before we find it.  Edward Norton deserved that oscar hands down, no if ands or buts because with his POWERHOUSE of a performance he made me a beliver...a beliver in the fact that anyone can change what they feel and with enough effort and love we can make a differnce in the lives we effect!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""All three of us got in that car""></head><body><p>As a general rule I like to read the book before watching the movie. However, every once in a while it happens to me that while watching a film I think that I would like to read the novel too. This was the case with "The Shipping News", and it was also the case with "Mystic River". When I watched this production, I was constantly thinking that the story was so perfect, that the book must be great. I hope I get a chance to confirm this suspicion soon.<br /><br />Anyway, going back to the movie, the story evolves around the lives of three childhood friends that went through a traumatic experience when one of them, Dave, was bullied into a car by two adults posing as police officers. He was abused for days until he could finally escape, but something broke inside him, and all three friends where affected as a result.<br /><br />Now, Jimmy (Sean Penn) owns a convenience store and is still involved with some dangerous men from his days as a delinquent, Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a police officer who was abandoned by his wife six months ago and Dave (Tim Robbins) is a married man that lives a quiet life but still has ghosts from his past that visit him. These three men have not really been in contact with each other over the last few years, even though they live in the same city.<br /><br />When Jimmy's oldest daughter is murdered, Sean is the detective in charge of the investigation. Also, Dave was in the bar Jimmy's daughter went to the night of her death, and he later came home to his wife bearing a knife wound and alleging that he was mugged by a man that he had to kill. Once the path of the three friends converges, we find ourselves in the middle of a craftily constructed story, which has all the elements that make a great mystery.<br /><br />Besides the script being incredibly good, it allows the actors to show their best aptitudes by having very powerful scenes and a lot of interesting exchanges. If you have seen this movie it should come as no surprise that both Sean Penn and Tim Robbins won Oscars for their performances in the Lead Actor and Supporting Actor respectively. I really found no drawbacks in this film, but understand that some people may find the story somewhat disturbing. I still think that it is worth seeing by anyone that is not extremely sensitive to murder and violence.</p></body></html>

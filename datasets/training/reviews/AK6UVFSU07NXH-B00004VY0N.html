<meta name="summary" content="NASA's finest hour"></head><body><p>To truly appreciate this film it may be necessary to see the TV mini series, &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;. However &quot;Apollo 13&quot; stands  on its own nearly as well. It is the story of the Apollo 13 NASA mission to  land on the moon. It was to be the third landing, Apollo 11 with Neil  Armstrong being the first.  Unfortunately Murphy was at the helm and  anything that could go wrong did.<br /><br />While the film was based on  reality, it actually went fairly close to showing reality, (a once on a  blue moon event, ha ha). The only deviations, (determined after reading Jim  Lovell's account), were minor and for the sake of simplifying complex  situations or dramatizing an otherwise technical problem.<br /><br />The cast  was terrific. Tom Hanks as Lovell was at his usual brilliant best. He was  well supported by Bill Paxton, (who seems to get parts in a lot of great  films), playing astronaut Fred Haise. And I want to give a special mention  to Kevin Bacon, who played Jack Swigert, for a better than usual effort. He  is really starting to mature as an actor.  I am a fan of Gary Sinise, so it  would be remiss of me not to praise his work as Ken Mattingly, the  astronaut that is bumped from the mission due to a potential case of  measles.<br /><br />The whole film was created from scratch, that is to say  no old NASA launch footage was used. The quality of the effects makes the  film seem more real than actual space missions. The director, Ron Howard,  was advised by actual astronauts and assisted by NASA, (for an enormous  fee). Even to the point of using true free fall environments to film the  appropriate space sequences and as far as I know, that is a first in movie  history.<br /><br />I see no point in giving a blow by blow rendition of this  film, if your are interested, read a history text. Suffice to say that it  is not only educational but thoroughly moving.</p></body></html>

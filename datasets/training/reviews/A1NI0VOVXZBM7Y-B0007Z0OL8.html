<meta name="summary" content="Team America"></head><body><p>Team America:<br /><br />Probably one of the most funniest movies I have ever seen despite featuring puppets!!! The movie is Hilarious,<br />And so true, Hans Flix(U.N. Inspector) "We will be very very Angry"in reply to what will happen if Kim Jong-Il does not comply with the Joke that is the United Nations, "Derka!,Derka"Soundtrack is hilarious. This unrated Dvd is Awesome.The Best is the portrayal of the Film actors guild and the silly liberal stance they take. Matt Damon!<br />All at these Celebs expense you can laugh at, Sean Penn,Clooney,Douglas,Susan Sarandon,Tim Robbins, "We Guards,Guards". so many lines stick out, I can understand were liberals can't stomach this movie. See it for yourself.It's A+ Funny, And still holds true today!</p></body></html>

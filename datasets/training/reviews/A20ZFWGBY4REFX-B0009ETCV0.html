<meta name="summary" content="Bruce Willis is back and better than ever in "Hostage"!!"></head><body><p>In all my years of watching every Bruce Willis film that has been made, there has never been a film of his quite like "Hostage", possibly the first great action thriller of 2005! I saw this in the theater just yesterday, and I was completely blown away by the action, suspense, and the surprising twists and turns from pulse-pounding start to breathtaking finish! The direction of Florent Siri was flawless! Willis' intense performance could not be better! In fact, this is his best since "Die Hard" and "The Sixth Sense"! Joining him are Kevin Pollak (Willis' "The Whole Nine Yards" and "The Whole Ten Yards" co-star), Ben Foster ("Liberty Heights"), Jonathan Tucker ("The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"), and young newcomers Jimmy Bennett, Michelle Horn, and Marshall Allman, in which they all gave excellent supporting performances!<br /><br />The film focuses on LAPD negotiator Jeff Talley (Willis), who became devastated by a failed hostage situation which resulted in the deaths of a young mother and her child. Talley exits Los Angeles for a no-profile job as chief of police in the low-crime hamlet of Bristo Camino, a small town in Ventura County. When three delinquent teenagers named Mars (Foster), Dennis (Tucker), and Kevin (Marshall Allman) follow home a family intending to steal their car, they have inadvertently picked the wrong house on the wrong day. The trio find themselves trapped in a multi-million dollar compound on the outskirts of town, owned by Walter Smith (Pollak), an accountant working for a mysterious crime enterprise. Panicked, the teenagers take the family hostage, placing Talley in exactly the kind of situation he never wanted to face again. Soon after, Talley readily hands authority of the hostage situation to the Ventura County Sheriff's Department and leaves the scene. Meanwhile, inside the compound is digital information, which is time-sensitive and invaluable to the mysterious criminals and critical to their enterprise. They will stop at nothing to get what belongs to them. The collateral: Talley's wife and daughter mysteriously taken hostage as well! This really puts Talley in a predicament: How does he save his wife and daughter without losing the lives of the hostages inside the house? Talley is forced to resume the command he abandoned, where the stakes quickly evolve into a hostage situation more volatile and terrifying than anything he could ever imagine.<br /><br />The ensemble cast is amazing! Bruce Willis, without a doubt, brings an electrifying presence into the role of Jeff Talley. Possibly his best role since the John McClane "Die Hard" days! Kevin Pollak was a little bit underused, but was still great nevertheless. Ben Foster brings a sinister, morbid change-of-pace performance to the role of Mars. A very well-done performance by the rising young star. Jonathan Tucker and Marshall Allman, who play brothers Dennis and Kevin Kelly, give powerful, extraordinary performances throughout. 17-year-old Michelle Horn really lives up to her name as Smith's daughter, Jennifer, and young newcomer Jimmy Bennett, who plays Smith's son, Tommy, was simply amazing! In fact, there seems to be a powerful and unforgettable connection between young Jimmy's character and Willis' character (reminded me of Willis and Haley Joel Osment in 1999's "The Sixth Sense").<br /><br />In conclusion, "Hostage", without a doubt, really makes up for the other Willis disappointments that were "Tears of the Sun" and "The Whole Ten Yards". In fact, "Hostage" has everything that a great action-thriller should have, including kinetic wall-to-wall action, crackling suspense that doesn't let up for a second, dynamic performances from a talented cast, and more! To me, this film really warmed me up until Willis' next film, "Sin City", will be released next month! "Hostage" is without a doubt, a DVD must-have to any Bruce Willis collection when released!</p></body></html>

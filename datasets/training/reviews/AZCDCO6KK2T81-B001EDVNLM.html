<meta name="summary" content="Bond Continues to Prove He and This Formula Will Die Another Day!"></head><body><p>I have to say that I loved this Bond film.  I loved the gadgets, cars, the women (who doesn't love Halle Berry?), the villains, the stunts and the effects.  This addition of the DVD is loaded with bonus features with special focus on the car stunts (the glacier chase).<br /><br />This Bond film has him making a mistake here and there (unlike most Bond films), and having a partner of sorts (Berry) through most of the film.  In addition, the style of direction is very different and highly stylized which was better than the typical "paint-by-numbers" of the previous directors.  This was just all around fun escapism and doesn't pretend to be more than that.  If this is Brosnan's swansong as Bond, then it is a fitting end for him unlike both Connery (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W9C9">Diamonds are Forever</a>) and Moore (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W9CD">A View to a Kill</a>) who had lackluster finishes as Bond.<br /><br />This was financially (at the time) the most successful Bond film raking in over $400 million until the recent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MNP2KI">Casino Royale (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a> which has hit the $500 million mark.  Brosnan has the role down and looks great for his age.  He certainly had plenty of Bond left in him and I am sad to see him go, but he should be onto bigger and better things now as he's really proven to be a fine actor.  Check out his marvelous performance in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EQ5UIC">The Matador (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  He has proven to be a diverse actor beyond the Bond films.  You might wanted to check him out or recall his performances in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IFQLIM">Mrs. Doubtfire</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783225547">Dante's Peak</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305657947">The Thomas Crown Affair</a> to see what I mean.  I think his later years will mirror Connery's, if he continues as he is.  I also think it's in the realm of possibility to see him as Bond again just as Connery revisited the role later and successfully in his more mature years in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004WEJZ">Never Say Never Again</a> where he is an intentionally aged Bond, but still smooth.<br /><br />Although this Bond film was the best by my standards, I realize there are many who have tired of this successful formula and I am one also to some degree.  I would have loved to have seen one or two more Bond flicks with Brosnan as he is a youthful looking 54, but I have no trouble with the direction the producers went with "Casino Royale" (see my review there if you are interested).  Just because something is very successful, doesn't mean it can't use some improvement and/or change.  Of course, none of this justifies the Bond producers terrible manner of firing Brosnan by fax message after they have always said "he can have the role as long as he wants it."  I think that is Hollyspeak for "until we change our minds . . ."</p></body></html>

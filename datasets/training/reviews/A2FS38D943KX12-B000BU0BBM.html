<meta name="summary" content="Visually striking, but with no depth in the story or characters; 3 1/2 stars"></head><body><p>To be fair, calling this movie simply eye candy is not completely doing it justice.  It is far too dark a movie to be categorized as such, and it is also clear that Gilliam has some aspirations beyond simply producing a visual spectacle.  If one really works hard at it, one could find the allegorical qualities in this film, as the captive children children in the forest could represent the captive population of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Westphalia.<br /><br />It is possible to see what this movie would have liked to have been. Unfortunately, the story-telling gets so muddy at times that any subtle messages that might exist simply get lost in the tangle of special effects and visual spectacle.  It also doesn't help that the Jacob Grimm, the central character who should have the most depth & complexity, is played by Heath Ledger, who has rarely displayed any particular acting talent.  Matt Damon (as Wilhelm Grimm) is adaquete but unremarkable in a role that has not been given much nuance by the script.  The supporting talents of Jonathan Pryce & Peter Stormare are put to entertaining use, but their characters are such broadly-drawn caricatures that they do not truly contribute to the development of the story.<br /><br />Younger children will be easily frightened by some of the abduction sequences, not to mention a few gruesome deaths.  I would imagine that those 12 and older will not find most scenes to be too jarring.<br /><br />And the rest of us?  In all probability, one will find this movie making precious little impact at all.  It is fascinating to watch while it is on the screen --- and the big screen really is the best medium for this film --- but once it is over, I very much doubt that many people will be drawn to see this movie again.</p></body></html>

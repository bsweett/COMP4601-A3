<meta name="summary" content="A haunting and overwhelming dystopian vision of the future"></head><body><p>By any measure this is one of the finest dystopian works of art ever made.  It easily takes its place alongside other visions of the future such as novels such as 1984, FAHRENHEIT 451, and BRAVE NEW WORLD and films such as BLADE RUNNER and BRAZIL.  But unlike most of these other dystopian masterpieces, CHILDREN OF MEN ends on a hopeful, mildly optimistic note.<br /><br />The movie, set approximately 20 years in the future, begins shockingly with an announcement on television news that the world's youngest person has died at age 18.  A few seconds later the fast food place on whose TV we have been watching the news is destroyed by a terrorist bomb.  The two shocking events set the tone for the rest of the film.  We get a picture of a society in rapid decline, a dying world in which one widely advertised project is Quietus, a reference to the peace that Hamlet might receive if the fear of an afterlife did not keep him from suicide.  In this instance it is indeed a medication for ending one's life.  The film is set in England, which is the last orderly spot on earth and which has become both armed encampment and police state, struggling both to control the populace at home and keep the rest of the world out.  The world crisis has been created by the sudden infertility of all the women in the world.  I normally would hestitate to reveal the next detail, but since advertisements for the movie have been giving it away there is no point in playing coy.  Theo, played by Clive Owen, is recruited to help assist a young black immigrant girl to a location where she can escape from England by vote.  The reason she is so important is simple:  she is pregnant.<br /><br />I won't spoil anymore of the plot.  I think this is a film that is best seen with minimal knowledge.  I will say that I have never seen a film that is more viscerally real than this one.  There are numerous action sequences that feel so realistic that they almost feel real than rigged.  This is not typical movie special effects, which usually are exaggerated to make it more theatrical.  The action is more muted, but also vastly more realistic, so that you almost feel that it is happening around you.  It is not always an easy movie to watch.  As Theo and Kee, the young girl played wonderfully by newcomer Claire-Hope Ashitey, wend their way through the chaos around them, you feel at times that the world is on the verge of collapse.  Some here have criticized the ending.  I found it moving and deeply touching, as well, as I mentioned above, quietly optimistic.<br /><br />Almost everything about this movie stands out.  The design of the film is outstanding.  It feels both futuristic and yet still very much like the world we live in now.  The cinematography is outstanding and the special effects as good as you will see without using CGI (there was CGI, but what I'm praising are the non-CGI effects).  The direction by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n is deft throughout and on the heels of such diverse successes as Y TU MAM&Aacute; TAMBI&Eacute;N, HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN (still by far the best film in that series), and THE LITTLE PRINCESS further establishes himself as one of the world's most fascinating directors.  And the acting is impeccable.  Clive Owen is simply one of the world's finest actors and this is his finest performance yet.  The film is buttressed by a number of supporting performances.  Although he hasn't yet had a break out performance to establish his popular reputation, Chiwetel Ejiofor has through a number of fascinating performances established himself as one of the worlds most versatile and gifted actors (try watching this film along with his performances in SERENITY, KINKY BOOTS, and DIRTY PRETTY THINGS and you'll get an idea of his talent and range).  Michael Caine is superb as a hippy journalist.<br /><br />I rarely like to comment on DVD special features because I don't think most people watch them and partly because it is never why I buy a DVD anyway.  But this disc has some of the best special features I've ever seen.  They explain how they performed some of the amazing special effects in the film.  I definitely recommend watching them.<br /><br />Just a word or two about astonishingly low rating this film is getting here on Amazon.  If this isn't a five star movie, the rating makes no sense.  Critics have been beside themselves in raving about this movie and ordinary fans and viewers are not giving this low ratings elsewhere.  On IMDB.com, for instance, it currently has a 8.1 User Rating and is #149 on the list of the 250 most highly rated films.  It really is that good.  I can only speculate on who is giving it such low ratings, but let me caution potential viewers that this is not a blockbuster adventure film.  If your idea of a great movie is SAHARA or NATIONAL TREASURE, you will find this to be a shocking disappointment.  But if you enjoy more artistically rendered films, like art films, and like more serious rather than merely commercial films, you will love this.  In my opinion it was, along with PAN'S LABYRINTH and THE LIVES OF OTHERS, one of the three truly great films of 2006 (though it went into general release in 2007, it had a limited 2006 release).  If you like intelligent, serious, noncommercial films, this will leave you stunned.</p></body></html>

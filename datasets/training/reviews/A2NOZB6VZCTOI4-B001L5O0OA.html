<meta name="summary" content="I Triple Dog Dare You!"></head><body><p>&quot;A Christmas Story&quot; is one of the true classics of American Cinema. I am admittedly not very big on most Christmas themed movies (too commercial), but I make a big exception here. Adapted from Jean Shepherd's wry book &quot;In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash&quot; and set in the American midwest of the 1940s, the movie follows young Ralphie, perfectly portrayed by Peter Billingsley, his family and friends during a youthful Christmas season. <p>During the course of the film we get to see typical childhood problems through the eyes of Ralphie. The problems include dealing with a neighborhood bully, enduring hideous Christmas presents (most notably the pink bunny suit, which is not to be missed), and the dreaded 'triple dog dare.' A brilliant cast is directed by veteran director Bob Clark. The parents in this film embody the no-nonsense, yet loving, parents of period America, in this case played to perfection by Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin. The highlight of the movie for me is EASILY the delivery of the dad's 'major award,' and his wife's acute embarrassment when it is placed in the living room window. (That's all I am going to say about the matter: if you haven't seen the movie, this scene alone is worth the asking price.) <p>The recurring theme through the movie is the angst induced by being repeatedly told that the one gift that Ralphie truly wants, a Daisy Red Ryder BB Gun ('with a compass in the stock and a thing that tells time') is off limits with the sentence &quot;You'll shoot your eye out.&quot; (Even the deranged department store Santa gives this same warning in another masterstroke.) In the end Dad turns out to be way more of a softy than we would have ever taken him for, and Ralphie has the best Christmas ever, despite the 'Bumpus hounds' devouring their Christmas dinner.<p>For the 2 CD set, you get the movie (of course) and some truly wonderful extras, most notably a documentary &quot;Another Christmas Story&quot; which interviews Clark, Billingsley (who looks exactly the same as an adult), and many other cast members about the making of the film. Also included is a fun trivia game (I got one question wrong), and the mini documentaries &quot;A History of the Daisy Red Ryder,&quot; and &quot;Get a Leg Up,&quot; which irrevocably demonstrates that humor is alive and well in America.<p>This is a classic! Get in the Christmas spirit and buy this film!</p></body></html>

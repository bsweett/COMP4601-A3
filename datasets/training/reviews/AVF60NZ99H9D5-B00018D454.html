<meta name="summary" content="another low budget indie horror classic DESECRATED"></head><body><p>Aside from Jessica Biel, who does her best with the feeble material given, as do R. Lee Ermey and the woman who plays "Leatherface's" mother, this is a pathetic effort--and done for the sole purpose of exploiting all the young and naive horror fans who don't know better--and who may not even be aware of the 1974 original.<br /><br />The people who made this thing are absolutely souless and have made this for one reason  and ONE REASON ONLY: to fill their pockets--with no regard for what made the original horror masterpiece work.<br /><br />The script is B.S, the direction? Lame. (Pun not intended.) Where is the suspense, Mr. Director? Did you think you were making another laxative commercial? Is that why the entire film feels like a commercial made for morons with a short attention span?<br /><br />The photography (even though it was Pearl, who did the original) is way too slick and makes what should have been grubby and eerie locations,appear fake--as though done on some Holllywood soundstage.<br /><br />So what was the purpose, then? Whose idea was it? Nispel's? The producer's?<br /><br />You stumbled and you fell.<br /><br />Go take a real look at the original TCM--and tell me what you see. Can you figure out what makes it work? Can you? It's not rocket science.<br /><br />The music? Way too lush for this film. Orchestral music for TCM? This is nuts. Look at the original! Mostly sound-effects--and NEXT TO NO MUSIC! THE WAY IT SHOULD BE DONE---for TCM!<br /><br />And "Leatherface?" Give me a break.<br /><br />Don't they know there is ONLY ONE GUY WHO CAN PLAY THIS CHARACTER? His name happens to be Gunnar Hansen. Remember the name?<br /><br />Of course, they do--but you see, the Hollywood whores just don't give a damn.<br /><br />It saddens me that this version pulled in 80 million. Because now, they will crank out even more tripe of this nature.<br /><br />I didn't buy this, by the way, a friend shoved it at me, saying he only paid ten bucks for it, used, and that maybe I should take a look, since I respected the original TCM so much.<br /><br />Guess what? I absolutely regret that I wasted time looking at this not-very horrifying and/or convincing "horror" flick. The only solace for me was being made aware of the gorgeous Jessica Biel.<br /><br />Lisa L. as well did what she could with what she had to work with. It would be interesting to see what these actors can do with a real director guiding them.</p></body></html>

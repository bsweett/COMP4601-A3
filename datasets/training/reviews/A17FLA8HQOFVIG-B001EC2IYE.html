<meta name="summary" content="A real winner.  Certainly deserved the Academy Award."></head><body><p>No doubt about it. This film certainly did deserve every academy award it walked away with.  Clearly, it is one of the finest films I've ever seen. It certainly is sad though.  And so I don't think I'd recommend it to everybody.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood has emerged as a new film icon.  He's 75, an age when most actors are quietly moving out of the public eye.  But he is at the top of his game and it's getting better and better.  He's perfect in the role as the fight manager who reluctantly agrees to train Hilary Swank and then connects with her in with a very special kind of bond.  Perhaps though, it is his role as a director that should win him the honors.  Every scene rings true, and the film techniques which use shadows so dark that occasionally the only light is on the perspiration on a actor's face, work well.  It's not overdone but it certainly adds to the atmosphere of the story.<br /><br />Hillary Swank is one of the finest actors I've ever seen. She immediately endears herself to the audience as the trailer trash waitress who dreams of becoming a boxer.  She has a special way of smiling and of showing determination on her face that is completely her own.  And Clint Eastwood brings out the best of her.  Then there is Morgan Freeman as the former boxer who works at the gym and who encourages Eastwood to train Swank.  His role calls for wisdom as well as the angst of losing an eye in his final boxing match many years before.  His presence adds character to every scene he's in.<br /><br />Some of this film is hard to watch, but it's certainly worth it.  It's more than just a boxing story.  It raises some serious questions of right and wrong and personal responsibility.  I will be thinking about it for a long time.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

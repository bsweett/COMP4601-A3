<meta name="summary" content="Slow movie plot detracts from great acting performances"></head><body><p>Michael Clayton received several Oscar nominations and features a star studded cast, so of course it must be judged accordingly. Is this movie worth the hype. I love George Clooney, in spite of the fact that I disagree with about everything he says politically. He's a great actor. He's great again as the star in Michael Clayton. Michael Clayton is a lawyer for a big firm whose biggest client happens to be U-North. U-North has been involved in a class action suit for six long years. Tilda Swinton plays Karen Crowder, U-North's in-house cousel. Authur Edens (played incredibly well by Tom Wilkinon) is the conflicted leat attorney in U-North's fight agaist the class action suit.<br /><br />When you get right down to it, this movie is a legal thriller. The plot gets thrown to you in pieces. The movie opens with a few scenes then backtracks to four days earlier. As a viewer, I wondered a lot what was going on. The movie got the suspese right, but unfortunately treated every scene like a supsense scene. I spent a lot of time wondering what was going on. Michael Clayton is a fixer that handles the firm's biggest problems. He has gambling problems, a kid that he sees occasionally, and a brother who has lost a lot of money to some thugs that Clayton is trying to repay. Arthur is having doubts about the case he is trying to win and has gone off his medication. Is he going crazy, or does he know what he's doing. Oscar winner Tilda Swinton's Karen Crowder, as U-North's counsel, will do anything to win.<br /><br />I had a lot of problems with this movie. It was incredibly slow, and the entire movie seemed evasive. It couldn't just come out and tell the story. The acting was top notch, except for Tilda Swinton. She seemed to play a one note character as a woman constantly in physical pain about the decisions she had to make.<br /><br />I was glad to see a "traditional" movie like Michael Clayton nominated for an Oscar instead of the usual foreign or left-wing politcal drivel that the general public never sees. However, Michael Clayton just doesn't seem like that good of a movie. Maybe I'm missing something, but in spite of the great acting and directing, the story just seemed to plod along and never connect with the viewer.</p></body></html>

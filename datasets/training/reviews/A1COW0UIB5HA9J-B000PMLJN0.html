<meta name="summary" content="Quite good supernatural thriller!"></head><body><p>Jamie Ashen (Ryan Kwanten) received a special ventriloquist doll mysteriously and his wife has been murdered, he believes the doll belongs to a famous ventriloquist named Mary Shaw a celebrity in the town of Ravens Fair. He takes the dummy with him and joins with an investigative detective (Donnie Wahlberg) as they go to Ravens Fair to investigate the mysterious murders that have been happening especially involving dolls as he discovers that the town is haunted by the evil spirit of Mary Shaw (Judith Roberts) and her demonic dolls.<br /><br />Refreshing and different horror thriller from James Wan and Leigh Whannell the makers of "Saw" that offers actual scares rather then gore abound. It's a supernatural fable with an interesting story, decent acting, a nice twisted ending and dark atmosphere that help makes this an exciting and enjoyable ghost story, i'm sure that people that want story and supernatural scares rather then just gore will find this movie a nice change of pace.<br /><br />This DVD contains the unrated version with some violence and scenes not shown in the theatrical version with nice extras like alternate ending & opening seuqneces, deleted scenes, Behind The Scenes of "Dead Silence", "Mary Shaw's secrets" featurette, "Evolution of a visual FX" featurette and Music Video.<br /><br />Also recommended: "The Shining", "Tourist Trap", "Magic", "Devil Doll (1964)", "Trilogy of Terror", "Dolls (1987)", "Puppet Master", "Child's Play Series", "Saw Trilogy", "The Others", "Making Contact (a.k.a.

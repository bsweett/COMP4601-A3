<meta name="summary" content="Good movie; horrible, propaganda-filled "extras""></head><body><p>I was somewhat hesitant about renting this movie, as I had heard that it was just another left/liberal rant against corporate/conservative types. It's not. If anything, it's more of a Christian allegory than anything else. The protagonist is named Theo (Greek for "god"), the movie opened in the USA on Christmas Day, and the story is basically a Nativity story set in a bleak, fascist future. It's a bit ponderous and heavy-handed in places, but overall "Children of Men" does a great job of making the world it is set in real and frightening. On its own merits, I'd give it four stars.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to dock this DVD a half-point or more for its inclusion of an unnecessary, irrelevant, and highly biased "bonus feature" called "The Possibility of Hope," which is complete rubbish. It is nearly a half hour long, and consists entirely of leftwing wackos ranting against globalism, capitalism, and industrial society in general -- all of which has little or nothing to do with the movie!<br /><br />At one point during the movie itself, when one of the Fishes starts making political comments, the others tell him to shut up, that it's all irrelevant now. Too bad the movie's producers didn't follow that advice. If they had, I'd be giving this DVD four stars, but as it stands I'm downgrading it to three.</p></body></html>

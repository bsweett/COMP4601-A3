<meta name="summary" content="ANOTHER REASON TO BE SCARED OF THE DARK!!!"></head><body><p>man this movie was hard core, since the first time i watched it, and even now after many many times of seeing it. it's still a good one for me. man especially since vin diesel was up in there. my hero. movie does him justice. he's great, his acting, and his skills. let the world know who he was. he's been unstoppable since. another one of my favorites is cole hauser. i give him props. this was a thrill ride. you never know what's in the dark. there's always a scare of the unknown. don't venture in the dark alone. "i'm not the one you gotta worry about", nicely spoken. riddicks not the bad guy here, he's going to turn out to be the hero, the leader, their hope. good movie, if you haven't seen it you definitly should.</p></body></html>

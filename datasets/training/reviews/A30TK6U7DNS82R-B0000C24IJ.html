<meta name="summary" content="Eliza in Peril"></head><body><p>She's able to climb the tallest trees in the forest, but the thing that is coming after her is faster, larger, infinitely sadistic . . .  If you liked seeing Eliza Dushku in ANGEL or BUFFY, you'll be happy she decided to take a similar part in this cheap, low budget and mindless thriller.  She is tough and sexy, and her amazing body gets quite a workout in the course of a few short hours, as she and a number of other young people stumble across a twisted family of serial killers who entrap the unwary and kill them, selling off their cars for parts and other junk.  It could happen to you!<br /><br />Also in the show is Jeremy Sisto, whom I know best from seeing him play the turbulent, talented Billy Chenoweth, the schizophrenic photographer on SIX FEET UNDER.  I wanted to see Billy and Faith get together but alas, after a mere twenty minutes into WRONG TURN, you knew this was not going to happen.  Alas.  Still the movie pairs Eliza with Desmond Harrington, who's got his own kind of charm and some serious survival skills.  On DVD you can stop the action on a dime and see where the "strings" of the monsters are, but that just adds to the fun.</p></body></html>

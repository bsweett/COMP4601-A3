<meta name="summary" content=""When a man loves a man""></head><body><p>"Brokeback Mountain" was a breakthrough in mainstream American cinema. It's the first (relatively) mainstream movie to address gay issues, and to treat a gay romance the same way as a straight one. In fact,the poster/CD cover of the leads was purposefully modeled on the one for "Titanic." Unlike "Titanic",however,"Brokeback" brings up important issues,has great depth,and is emotionally moving.<br /><br />Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) goes to the mountains of Wyoming for sheep herding. There,he meets Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal),and there's a spark between them. For a time,they enjoy a pastoral and amorous idyll. Soon,their paradise is lost. Both Ennis and Jack marry. They have children. They reunite every summer, their time together bittersweet. Apart from each other, Ennis and Jack break down. Ennis' marriage ends in divorce. Jack carries on an affair with another cowboy,and also has a one night stand with a Mexican prostitute. Jack has hopes for a life with Ennis-but Ennis is afraid. In the end, Jack is murdered in a gay-bashing,and Ennis lives a life mourning "the road not taken." Ledger is excellent as the emotionally uptight Ennis,while Gyllenhaal is heartbreaking as the hopeful Jack.<br /><br />"Brokeback Mountain" is hardly "homosexual propaganda" (as LifeSite has called it),or an "attack on masculinity" (according to DecentFilms) Jack&Ennis' mutual adultery does devastate their families. It's not the "adultery without consequences" that's so often glamorized. The consummation between Jack&Ennis is disturbing because it looks like a rape--not because it's between two men. The morning after is hardly domestic bliss-Ennis finds a lamb killed by a wolf during the night. Anne Hathaway is amazingly sympathetic as Jack's heartbroken wife.<br /><br />The positive aspects of the movie are the performances of the leads,the powerful soundtrack (Gustavo Santoalalla is great),its beautiful scenery.<br /><br />One can disagree with the movie's message that it's an argument for gay marriage,or that homosexual and heterosexual love are the same,but it stands as a work of an art. As a work of art,it's open to interpretation;it's hardly "a homosexual propaganda film." Does it say gay is OK? It depends on the viewer.<br /><br />The ending of "Brokeback Mountain" is a tearjerker. When Ennis cradles Jack's bloodied shirt in his arms,how can one be unmoved? "Brokeback Mountain" takes on new,poignant resonance in light of Heath Ledger's tragic,untimely death. Ennis was his breakthrough role,showing his promise as a subtle,powerful actor. He conveyed the depth of Ennis' emotional repression&suffering. Heath Ledger will rightly be remembered for "Brokeback".<br />RIP Heath Ledger (1979-2008)</p></body></html>

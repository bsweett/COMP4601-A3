<meta name="summary" content="It's Superman"></head><body><p>Thanks to this movie, we now have the 89' Batman movie, and all other comic book movies. After watching this again, this is what a Superman movie should be, I'd give it more stars if I could. The movie opens up with John williams soaring iconic score, and then we come to Krypton, now the original intent was to film a massive Superman movie, kind of like what the salkynds had done with the three musketeers. They wanted it to be really campy too, but Dick donner ruined that, Now it's already been said about the behind the scenes arguing between Donner and the salkinds. Christopher Reeve as Superman, Marlon Brando as Jor-El. Now, he was cut out of Richard Lester's Superman II because the salkinds were cheap and didn't want to pay him, pure and simple. Now, for it being 1978, the effects of this movie stand up pretty well, and I'm sorry, but even the modern movies could take a lesson from this movie. Because I honestly believe that Superman is flying, and it's all done without CGI, the romance between Superman and Lois is believable. Now yes, Gene Hackman played Lex Luthor over the top. But to be fair, Lex Luthor wasn't the evil billionare in the comic books yet. Now some have complained about the whole turning the world back ending, I honestly didn't care. Because that's something that Superman is capable of doing, and it was supposed to be the ending to Superman II, but because the salkinds never told Donner that he was over budget. They wanted him to wrap up Superman The Movie, thus the ending was Taken from the second movie and put in the first. And it works, this movie was ground breaking, and Christopher Reeve is Superman.</p></body></html>

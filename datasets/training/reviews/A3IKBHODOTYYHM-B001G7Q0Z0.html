One must marvel at Franklin J. Schaffner's ability to make something this scientific and controversial work on the big screen. <p>One of the great aspects of the film is the slow build up of tension at the film's outset. Taylor (played by Charlton Heston) is aboard a spaceship with a few other explorers as the ship careens slowly through space. The gloomy outlook that Taylor possesses on existence (he says mechanically &quot;I feel lonely&quot;) is only outweighed by the mysterious existence of time travel. The ship lands in the year 3978 in the waters of some land, and those who survive are left to discover exactly where they are and what time they are living in. <p>Although it is a physical journey, there is also a philosophical journey for Taylor. He adopts the standpoint that &quot;life is meaningless&quot;, appearing rebellious against the human spirit. Seemingly, he is not only escaping time but, in his bitterness, looking for something better than mankind. <p>The progression of discoveries in the first part establishes a mood of slight creepiness. This is not a movie that rushes the critical points of background information so it can cut to the chase; instead, the viewer is experiencing the journey of a new land with the travelers. The crew begins to find small existences of life (waterfall, plant life, footprints). Ultimately, they discover that humans are there, but this discovery is truly ironic. <p>We eventually discover that there is a twist to this society. The role-reversal is that apes rule people. Not only are humans ruled, but also kept captive and treated as the inferior race (&quot;beasts&quot; is what one of the apes says when referring to a human). Apes believe humans are dirty. The apes are doctors, scientists, guards, philosophers and leaders while humans are lacking intelligence and the ability to speak (except for Taylor). Also within this topsy-turvy world many of the expressions are reversed to fit the apes' world (&quot;Human see, human do.&quot;). <p>The question of origin is the movie's main subject. Cornelius, one of the apes, announces to one of the leaders his theorem that &quot;ape evolved from man&quot;, based on his findings in The Forbidden Zone (a land that is seclude from society of apes). This viewpoint is naturally construed as ridiculous and impossible by many of the apes. Taylor searches for a way to escape, and, at the same time, tries to come to terms with an understanding of how society evolved this way. <p>In one form, the movie is a commentary on both evolution and individual and societal identity (or lack thereof). Taylor's ultimate discovery is a subject of irony and devastation, his destiny being his ultimate fear. Masterfully put together, Planet of the Apes mixes a blend of sci-fi, action, creepiness and commentary that not only produce a good movie, but an intelligent one as well.</p></body></html>

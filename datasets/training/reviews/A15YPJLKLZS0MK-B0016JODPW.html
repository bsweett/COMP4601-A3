<meta name="summary" content="Thriller"></head><body><p>This is a suspense thriller about a robbing of a jewel store. The owners are the cuplrits' mom and dad. Opens with a sex scene. Outside of a couple scenes of that, I wouldn't recommend it, but it wasn't a bad movie. Even though I would not want to see it again.</p></body></html>

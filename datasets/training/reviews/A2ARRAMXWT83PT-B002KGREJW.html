<meta name="summary" content="The best film of the summer, possibly the year!"></head><body><p>It's been a while since I have written a review on this website, so I'll start off a new string of them with the best film that I've seen in a long time. "Little Miss Sunshine" is one of the most well-written, engrossing, hilarious, and touching films that I have seen in a very long time. By now, you all know the basic plot of the film: a highly dysfunctional family goes on a road trip in order to get to a beauty pageant that Olive, the youngest of the clan, has been nomintated to compete in. The first half of the film focuses on everything that happens on the way to that beauty pageant, and it is great! The performances were ALL top notch, especially the ones from Abigail Breslin as Olive, Steve Carrel as Uncle Frank, and Alan Arkin as Grandpa. Everyone else was just as great! The direction and the script were all top-notch. All in all, this film was perfect. It takes all sorts of "family film" cliches, turns them upside down, and into one of the best satires in recent memory.<br /><br />The directors themselves have stated that this was a film "not about family values, but the value of family", and this couldn't be farther from the truth. Those looking for a tidy, clean family film should probably steer clear from this one. It's R rating is there for a reason, mainly because of the language, brief drug content, and a few glimpses of pornography. It's definitely not for young children, but everyone else will be in for a treat!<br /><br />This film is highly recommended! Another great thing about this film is that it makes you appreciate your family!<br /><br />Go see it! You will not be disappointed!</p></body></html>

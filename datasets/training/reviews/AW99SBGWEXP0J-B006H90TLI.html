<meta name="summary" content="No Country For Old Men"></head><body><p>Anton Chigurh (Bardem) is a serial killer, wandering Texas and killing indiscriminately.  The only thing likely to help one win an encounter with him is winning a coin toss.  He is cold blooded and merciless.  Moss (Brolin), a welder on a hunting trip, stumbles upon a bunch of dead bodies, a truck full of "Mexican brown" and a suitcase full of money - all that remains of a drug deal gone bad.  He takes the cash and runs, but somebody else wants the money.  Sheriff Bell (Jones) is the sheriff in the county where Chigurh escapes and where the drug deal went down.  They are all on a collision course, and not all of them will be left standing when all is said and done.<br /><br />"No Country For Old Men" is non-stop relentlessness from beginning to end.  The story is great, full of twists that are not at all predictable.  The acting is top notch, especially Bardem, whose Chigurh is a terrifying, remorseless killer.  He is not someone you would ever want to run into.  The direction by the Coen Brothers is some of the best of their careers.  This film is a definite Oscar contender on many fronts, and I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

The story begins when two farm boys, Ennis and Jack, meet while herding sheep on isolated Brokeback Mountain.  The job is for the summer and they must camp out with the sheep.  They share the stories of their love deprived  childhoods and on a cold night they end up sharing a tent.  They make love and develop a passionate bond.  Taciturn Ennis is nearly incapable of revealing, let alone talking, about his feelings to the more demonstrative Jack.<br /><br />Over the next twenty years or so, Jack and Ennis meet for fishing trips and to renew their passion.  Both are married with children in their attempts to fit in to the demands of culture. Jack is able to express his dissatisfaction with being apart from his true love and repeatedly suggests that he and Ennis get a ranch together.  Ennis is barely able to talk about this, let alone allow himself to be with Jack.<br /><br />This film creates an atmosphere of love and longing, while unflinchingly showing the lack of acceptance by mainstream culture of alternate lifestyles.  The scenic splendour of nature is filmed with haunting clarity.  This provides an element of nature, almost as another character in the film, acting as a neutral witness to human passion.  Gyllenhaal and Ledger are touching and beautiful in their roles.  The supporting actresses playing their wives, Michelle Williams and Ann Hathaway, provide accurate and devastating performances.</p></body></html>

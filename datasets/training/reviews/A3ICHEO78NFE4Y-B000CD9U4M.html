<meta name="summary" content="Weird!"></head><body><p>Not a family film in anyway.  This film is just weird, scary and not really entertaining.  Why film makers of now-a-days think that they can outdo something as wonderful as the original production is way beyond me.  I was not impressed, if anything the film was extremely distorting.  I should have realized that Tim Burton does not have a grip on reality anyway.  Hollywood gets more weird each day and i believe that i will be staying away from Hollywood/american entertainment of film making.  No wonder less and less people are viewing american films.  It seems that whatever is produced in Hollywood should stay in Hollywood.  It would be a blessing if someday the state of California just breaks off and falls into the ocean.</p></body></html>

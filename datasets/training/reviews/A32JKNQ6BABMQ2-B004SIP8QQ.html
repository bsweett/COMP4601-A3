<meta name="summary" content="would have had a 5 but for some sloppiness."></head><body><p>first the flaws.once again,the dead baby thing is no good.the end kind of sucks.it ends with them laughung together.besides one interesting story about superman,the final scene is a letdown.the story,carried over from the first part,has uma killing off the remaining people on her list including a redneck and a chick with one eye.that was a good fight.theres a bad ass burial scene that gave me the creeps big time too.then it goes back and shows her and some blind oriental dude from the skittles commercial who trains her.he treats her very poorly.then onto bill.the kids really shouldnt watch it due to rather innappropriate additions to thier vocabulary and graphic violence.quenten tarentinois your director,so you know its a godsend of a movie.i think it is better than the first one.i really liked the first one too.action fans and martial arts fans will probably like this one te most.it is emotionaly charged but the emotions are poorly in the last scene.umathurman is pretty hot.she has a very pretty face when shes buried.i know that sounds sick,but when shes in her casket shes pretty.that dude from kung fu the legends continues is bill.hes been in a bunch of cool movies like death race 2000 and cannonball run.the most intense part is when uma is buried alive.very spooky.i guess there cant be a kill bill 3.an excellent film.like i said,if it wasnt for the crappy final scene and the whole dead baby thing,it would have got a 5 star rating.</p></body></html>

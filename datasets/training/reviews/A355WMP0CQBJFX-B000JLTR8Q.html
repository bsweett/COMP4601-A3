<meta name="summary" content="A FAIRY TALE WORTH TELLING!!!"></head><body><p>i love all of m. night shyamalan's movies. he's great period. signs, the village, the six sense, and now lady in the water. he did it again. all of his movies have a different creepiness to them a different chill, a what if? or is there? behind them. this movie is super the story is lovely. from the hotel, to the people, to the lady, to the monsters, it's all good.  imagine a beautiful fairy tale coming to life. real people being heros, villians, and things that you just wouldn't expect. a young woman from another world comes into our world and opens a mans eyes to a lot more that's out there. gives him a reason to feel useful, that there is more to life, even things you thought impossible. he must help her, protect her, and get her to her destination with the help of those in his hotel. the imagination is beautiful, the creatures are very well designed, and so out there. if you don't get it then you just don't get it, but for those of us who do, you know it's certanly worth it. i wonder what's next.</p></body></html>

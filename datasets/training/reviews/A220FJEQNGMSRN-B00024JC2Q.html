<meta name="summary" content="More fun that it has a right to be"></head><body><p>Starsky and Hutch is more fun than it has any right to be, even if it does depart from the series in many ways. Stiller has Paul Michael Glaser's mannerisms down to a tee (he even has Glaser's bizarre run, like a hyperactive duck doing a windmill impersonation, down to perfection) but otherwise is another of his trademark anal neurotics while Owen Wilson takes Hutch even further away as a laid back dude not above a spot of robbery to supplement his salary. But it is funny, good natured and doesn't outstay its welcome too much. The only real bum note is giving the final glory to Snoop's terrible Huggy Bear, a charmless, boring and lazy performance constantly outshone by his own bodyguards.</p></body></html>

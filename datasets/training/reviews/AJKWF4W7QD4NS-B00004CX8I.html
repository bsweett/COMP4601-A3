Nicholson's McMurphy is a new inmate in a psychiatric ward who quickly rebels against the oppressive staff (which is personified by Nurse Ratched; played by Louise Fletcher in her Oscar winning role) while making quite an impact on his fellow inmates.  Director Milos Forman populates the film with memorable sequences while the screenplay offers many memorable, and in some cases unforgettable, characters; but none can steal the thunder of Jack Nicholson in the role he was born to play.  The rest of the cast includes Brad Dourif (in his film debut), Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, William Refield, Scatman Crothers, and an unforgettable Will Sampson as people you won't soon forget; and all of whom give superb performances.  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest went on to sweep the Oscar's for all the major award categories (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay) while it solidified itself as a true masterpiece of film.  The film itself hasn't aged a day, and is still as much of a classic today as it was when first released almost thirty years ago.  The DVD itself is worth noting as well: including a commentary by Forman and producers Michael Douglas and Saul Zaentz; plus an interesting documentary and some deleted scenes as well.</p></body></html>

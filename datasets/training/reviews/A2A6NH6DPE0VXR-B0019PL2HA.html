<meta name="summary" content="The Fast and Hilarious"></head><body><p>I felt pretty stupid watching this movie because I just couldn't stop laughing. It's a racing comedy and the racing scenes are surprisingly well done and the cast works great together. Will Ferrell is hilarious as Ricky Bobby who just wants to go fast, so it's not surprising that he became a fast rising racing star. His father "Gary Cole in great comic form" appeared once in his childhood just to give him one piece of advice "if you're not first, you're last". So Ricky heald on to that piece of advice his entire life.<br /><br />  After a racing accident that leaves him afraid of driving fast, his father finally shows back into his life to try and get him back on his feet. He didn't only lose his racing career but his best buddy "the awesome John C. Reilly" stole his wife. Cole helps him out in the funniest ways. I mean one scene has him telling Ricky to drive away quick because he taped cocaine on the bottom of the car and called the cops. This movie is just great fun and it's hard not to laugh watching it when everyone in it is actually funny. Michael Clarke Duncan is even more lively than ever as Farrell's racing coach. While John C. Reilly and Gary Cole "especially Cole" are so good here in supporting roles that I wish comedy roles got nominated a lot more. Reilly can handle any type of role whether it's comedy or drama and he's a great partner for Farrell here. He was Ricky's bestfriend since childhood and loves him but is jealous that he  has to help Ricky win but Ricky never helps him win.<br /><br />  Even it's uncalled for  jokes are hard not to laugh at even if they are wrong. Sure Ricky's kids curse a lot and he taught them to tell off their grandfather and it may have been wrong to laugh but.... I laughed. I may also go to hell for laughing at how Ricky prefers praying to baby jesus but....I laughed. Stuff like that may make the movie sound overly offensive but it's not really. It's actually a smart movie with some charm and has a better script than most Adam Sandler comedies "maybe even all Adam Sandler comedies". I usually think the summer is dead once August hits but this movie really caught me by surprise. It's a ton of fun and one of Will Farrell's best movies. It's certainly way better than any of his comedies that he made last year.</p></body></html>

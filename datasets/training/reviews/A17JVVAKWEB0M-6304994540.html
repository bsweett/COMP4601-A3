<meta name="summary" content="Sometimes there's a man..."></head><body><p>"Sometimes, there's a man, well, he's the man for his time and place. He fits right in there. And that's the Dude. The Dude, from Los Angeles."<br /><br />"The Dude" never had much use for his given name, Jeffrey Lebowski.  And for a man who lives to drink White Russians and bowl with his friends, who needs a big old name like that?  His real name is the source of much of his trouble in The Big Lebowski, however, as he is mistaken for a millionaire with the same name whose wife "owns money all over town".  Played by Jeff Bridges with a goatee, long hair and oversized pajama bottoms and Bermuda shorts that look like he stole from a homeless man, the pot-smoking Dude passes through life with the constant abandonment of a lazy summer day...until goons seeking the other Lebowski assault him and urinate on the rug that "really tied the room together, man."<br /><br />The resulting action is a charming, meandering follow-up to The Coen Brothers' critically acclaimed Fargo.  Although the two have a few cast members in common and the Coens' trademark of finding art in shots of day-to-day life (a great montage of bowlers plays with the opening credits), the films have little in common.  Where Fargo was an unrelenting drama, full of suspense and mystery, The Big Lebowski is more of a good time.  Yeah, there's a plot in there about how Lebowski's search for retribution for his soiled rug thrusts him into a kidnapping caper with pornographers and nihilists, but the film is more about The Dude, the man for his time and place.</p></body></html>

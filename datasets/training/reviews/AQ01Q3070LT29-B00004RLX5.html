<meta name="summary" content="The crew time-travels to San Francisco 1986."></head><body><p>The beginning of this VHS treats you to a preview of the upcoming new tv series, STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION (1987-94).<br />  This film also is dedicated to the crew of the space shuttle Challenger who exploded 73 seconds after take-off on January 28, 1986.<br /><br />Leonard Nimoy is the director of this film.<br /><br />The Ambassador of Klingons (John Shuck) is upset with James T. Kirk and the Genesis project.  Sarek (Mark Lenard) attends the trial to defend Admiral Kirk.<br />  Currently, their is a probe from an unknown source in space that is causing phenomenal weather conditions in Juno, Alaska and San Francisco, California where Starfleet is based.  The probe is vaporizing the ocean.<br />  Stardate: 8390: Spock has had three months of Vulcan exile.  Spock (Leonard Nimoy) is taking a computer exam.  When asked, "How do you feel?", Spock does not know how to answer.  Spock's mother, Amanda (Jane Wyatt) explains to her son, his human feelings for the crew of the Enterprise.  Spock returns to command, however McCoy (DeForest Kelley) has some misgivings about Spock that he might not have all of his bearings yet.  The Enterprise crew has decided to return to Earth in the Klingon spaceship since Starfleet cannot send a ship. The Enterprise ship, their home, had to be abandoned and was destroyed. By a timed destruction, they saved their lives.  They must find a way to tranmit to the probe to stop its avenge.  The tranmission signals the probe which is releasing a whale song. It needs a reply.<br />  The Enterprise crew, along with Scotty (James Doohan), Chekov (Walter Koenig), Sulu (George Takei) and Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), must travel back to the 21rst Century to find humpback whales and bring them into the 23rd Century to reply with the probe.  At warp speed 9.8, they end up at 20th Century Earth.  They follow a whale signal and they land in San Francisco, California in the Golden Gate Park.  It is 1986.  Kirk and Spock find a whale biologist, Gillian (Catherine Hicks) that will be of some help to them.<br />  Also in the cast: Robin Curtis, Majel Barrett, Grace Lee Whitney, Vijay Amritraj, Madge Sinclair, Michael Berryman, Joe Lando, Brock Peters, Robert Ellenstein.<br />  This is my least favorite Star Trek film, however, I did enjoy the comic relief of our beloved Enterprise cast abd Catherine Hicks was a "seventh heaven" to look at.  Always nice to see Jane Wyatt.<br /><br />  Jane Wyatt played Spock's mother, Amanda, in the original STAR TREk tv series, Season 2, episode #10, "Journey To Babel" with Mark Lenard as "Sarek" in 1967.<br /><br />The next year after this film, a new tv series, STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION, premiered on the UPN Network in 1987, introducing a new crew to the Enterprise, set 60 years after Kirk's original reign as Captain.  DeForest Kelley returned  as Dr. McCoy as the oldest living crew member, in the pilot episodes.  Majel Barrett, Mark Lenard and Leonard Nimoy would later appear in the tv series.<br /><br />  The next film is: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305350205">Star Trek V - The Final Frontier</a> (1989).<br /><br /> Followed by:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305252599">Star Trek VI - The Undiscovered Country</a> (1991).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002HDOB8">Star Trek - Generations (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a> (1994).<br /><br />The cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987-94) took over the movie franchise.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305127638">Star Trek - First Contact</a> (1996).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000ILBK">Star Trek - Insurrection</a> (1998).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008O0WN">Star Trek - Nemesis (Full Screen Edition)</a> (2002).<br /><br />The original STAR TREK characters (1966-69, 1979-94) were explored again in<br />STAR TREK (2009).<br /><br />***Update: STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS will be released May 17, 2013.</p></body></html>

Rowling. I think it's one of the better adaptions, in terms of flow of plot, even if it omits and augments sizable elements of the book.<br /><br />It's Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe's) fourth year at Hogwarts, and what a special year it is. Over the summer, Harry got to see the Quidditch world cup, and during the school year, he gets to compete in the Triwizard Tournament. The only problem is, he isn't actually supposed to be in it. It is only for students over 17, and only for three champions to compete in. Harry is 14, and is the fourth champion. Has someone planted his name? Has the Goblet of Fire, the magical artifact that makes such decisions, made a mistake? The Triwizard Tournament is very dangerous, perhaps someone wants to see him died. With new faces, a strange new teacher and an upcoming school dance, it turns out to be a very hectic year, and one that will change the lives of all concerned forever.<br /><br />If you've read the book, you'll notice that a lot of side plots have been cut out of the film. We don't see the Dursley family at all, nor do we see the Creeveys. Dobby, Winky and the kitchen of house elves are completely absent, and their actions important to the plot given to other characters. Sirius Black, apart from a small scene, is missing too. We don't even get to see any Veelas! Still, I didn't find it a major point. It keeps the plot pacy and the film shorter, and you still can follow everything, even if you haven't read the book, which can't be said about all of these films. However, I really would have liked to have seen more of the Quidditch World Cup, the scenes from which were way too quick and cut up. What is with modern filmmakers avoiding slow paced beginnings? Annoys me a lot, that particular trend.<br /><br />All the kids growing up, which has always been interesting to watch. The school dance scenes are nicely done, and there's plenty of awkwardness and embarassment between the sexes, a little exaggerated, but that just adds to the color and humour of the scenes. It A few new faces in the cast, including David Tennant, the man who has just recently become the 10th Doctor Who, as Barty Crouch Jr. British character actor Mark Williams once again plays Mr Weasley. It's interesting, because here we get to see him play angry, furious in fact, something I've never seen him do terribly often, and I'm a fan of his. It's a far cry from campy menswear salesman of "The Fast Show" and the rough and tumble Olaf Petersen of "Red Dwarf". Also, check out the band that plays in the school dance. It features Jarvis Cocker of Britpop band Pulp, plus two members of Radiohead (Johnny Greenwood and Phil Selway). Don't really get to see them much though.<br /><br />The special effects were pretty standard fare. I mean, they're detail, but there's no giant leaps, CG seems more an institution rather than an innovation here. Did they have a lower budget or something? Even the DVD seems a little more cheaply, it terms of presentation.<br /><br />Still special features, like always, are many and varied, though the way they're displayed is a little more subdued and static than the last couple of Harry Potter DVD volumes. There's about 9 minutes worth of deleted scenes. Rather than being put in a menu to choose from, they are all stuck together as one long montage, which I found a little bit annoying. A couple of them are worth a mention. There a performance Hogwarts School Song by the school (whose lyrics you can find in Rowling's first Harry Potter book), and a full song by the Wyrd Sisters band. There's the featurette "Preparing for the Yule Ball", a behind the scenes look at the school dance scenes.There's the 30 minute "Conversations With The Cast" hosted by Richard Curtis, which features a lengthy interview with Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watston. It also features questions by fans who won a competition to meet the cast. There's "Reflections on the Fourth Film", a featurette which shows the cast at work and at play. There's a behind the scenes featurette for each of the tri-wizard tasks, which show us interviews with the ever hard working CG/SFX guys, plus a little bit from the cast. There's a "Meet the Champions" feature, with interviews and plenty of behind the scenes banter and fly on the wall antics with the actors who play the Triwizard Champions. There's a featurette on Voldemort, and there's the original theatrical trailer too.<br /><br />As in all the other DVDs, there are the games, this time based on the tasks of the Triwizard Tournament. For the most part I found these to be most frustrating. They were the sort of games where you have to press your remote at exactly the right time and exactly the right way, games that don't give you too many times to make mistakes. It's more about remembering a sequence than fun. The maze was the best of them, a lot like an RPG video game, complete with computer animated characters. You can choose your school and cast spells on the nasty creatures within, plus you can take your time. It was pretty atmospheric for a bonus feature, and features things from the maze mentioned in the book but not in the film (like the mysterious golden mist). If you manage to get through those games, you can have a run through Voldemort's graveyard, which is a reasonable mini-game.<br /><br />It's worth a look, but I'd check out the previous titles in the series first, be they books or DVD.</p></body></html>

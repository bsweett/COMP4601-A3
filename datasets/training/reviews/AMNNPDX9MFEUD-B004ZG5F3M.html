It is a sweet fable about personal freedom and the simple enjoyment of life. The acting is superb all the way around from the always great Judi Densch and Alfred Molina to the small but vital work of Johnny Depp (nice guitar work on the Robert Johnson and Django medley!)and culminates in the excellence of Juliette Binoche. It is a  shame that her subtle and understated elegance lost out to the over-the-top performance by Julia Roberts for the Academy Award.<br />The pacing, the tender storyline, the acting, the gorgeous scenery, and the precise musical scoring allow for a total abandonment of the self so that one can revel in the deliciousness of this film. Chocolat is rich, warm, and satisfying.</p></body></html>

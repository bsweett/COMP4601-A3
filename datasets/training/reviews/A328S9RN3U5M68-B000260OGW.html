<meta name="summary" content="The Return of the Romance Western"></head><body><p>OPEN RANGE is top on the list of recent Western films - but then there really haven't been many decent Western films since Clint Eastwood's mighty THE UNFORGIVEN.  But here is a majestically beautiful, seemingly endless expanse of open range with waving grasses, field lupine, ominous clouds, torrential rainfalls, and vistas that seem to extend forever.  This 'place' is the true Star of the film and though we may long for the American prairie it depicts, in reality the star is Canada!  <p>The story is simple and direct - the cowman vs. the rancher.  Kevin Costner and Robert DuVall (both in superb acting form) are bonded with Abraham Benrubi and Diego Luna are free ranging cattlemen who encounter the antipathy of evil and corrupt rancher Michael Gambon and strike at each other until the shootout in the local town decides the victor.  The townsfolk include a Doc and his sister, Annette Benning, and a wily character plyer with gusto by Michael Jeter.  Though this doesn't sound like much of a tale it is in the telling and the visualization that the magic happens.  The discourses between DuVall and Costner are not only beautifully and subtly written, but they are played with enormous sensitivity.  Director Costner knows when to let the universal  beauty of the open range sing when it is the stage: he also knows how to handle the essentially dark interiors of the hokey little town saloon and jail.  All of the actors are in synch with the tone of the movie and it is much to Costner's credit that he has resurrected The Western as one of the significant and sublime American art forms.  A spellbinding, visually magnificent, excellent movie.</p></body></html>

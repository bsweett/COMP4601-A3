One day, during a race, Bobby replaces famed NASCAR racer Terry Cheveaux (Adam McKay) and finishes the race at 3rd. Regardless of that, he caught the eye of Carly (Leslie Bibb), a smokin'-hot woman who flashes him. Both got married, and live in a beautiful home with two kids (Houston Tumlin and Grayson Russell). Around this time, Bobby and childhood friend Cal (John C. Reilly) have perfected a technique called "Shake and Bake," where the former shakes and the latter bakes. This helps Bobby win races. That may come to an end, when he meets competition in the form of flamboyant formula-one racer Jean Girrard (Sasha Baron Cohen).<br /><br />Back in 2004, Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay made a 90-minute SNL sketch, not on the sketch variety show, but on the silver screen. "Anchorman" was a hit with critics, but released at a bad time ("Spider-Man 2," anyone?). Well, the duo is back, moving from the news desk to the famous Talladega Superspeedway. This is "Talladega Nights."<br /><br />McKay and Ferrell (once again producing) have added some new twists to this comedy. Including keeping actors from hogging the camera for too long, "Talladega Nights" features plenty of NASCAR idiosyncrasies (including product placement from EA Sports to Power Ade), lots of redneck lampooning, and the idea of gay French men being part of a hard-boiled sport like this (once again, the artist formerly known as "Ali G" rocks the boat, this time with a hilarious French accent).<br /><br />Adam McKay also has a knack for directing good action scenes. But hey, you get famed cinematographer Oliver Wood ("The Bourne Identity" and "Face/Off"), anything's possible. Sure, some scenes look like they've been created with computers, but unlike "Dukes of Hazzard" and "Taxi," they don't wear out their welcome. And there's a rockin' good soundtrack featuring tunes from Audioslave, AC/DC, Saliva, and many more.<br /><br />Of course, the movie still has a lot of actors ad-libbing their way through scenes. This is Will Ferrell's comedy, and unlike in "Bewitched," McKay knows what works and what doesn't work. It's hit-and-miss, but Ferrell isn't as annoying. He even has good talent working with him, including some SNL alums (David Koechner, Rob Riggle, and Molly Shannon), award winners (Amy Adams and Michael Clarke Duncan), and Gary Cole and Jane Lynch as Ricky Bobby's parents. There are a good couple cameos from the real-life NASCAR drivers and announcers... but why waste Mos Def and Elvis Costello? I think they would've benefited from McKay's comedic direction. Oh well...<br /><br />I must say that after a couple of downers in 2005, it's great to see Will Ferrell back with his SNL writer-cum-director. And the actresses (including Leslie Bibb) are a joy even if they're not in the movie long enough (Molly Shannon, what the hell?). If you enjoyed "Anchorman," by all means check out "Talladega Nights." Let's hope it makes bank.</p></body></html>

Shia's character reacts particularly realistically, certain that his chances are better with the FBI agents who have taken him into custody and only fleeing when the alternative is to be shot and killed. Equally realistically, both of the "activated" people react with hostility and suspicion towards the other, convinced that the other may not be as innocent as they know that they themselves are.<br /><br />The plot unfolds quickly and manically, with just enough "catch up" explanations to keep the viewer in the loop (and plenty of "Oh, THAT's why..." moments) without ever devolving into a derailing exposition monologue. The 'good guys' catch on to the real story much faster than in your average "everyone must be dumb to facilitate the plot" story and the villain behind the mysterious phone calls has a nice, if slightly predictable twist. All the acting is done surprisingly well, which is just that much more proof that an action movie doesn't require a bunch of big name actors to be decent. And I was particularly pleased that while the movie did finally succumb to the mandatory "we have to fall in love now" nonsense that every action/adventure movie seems to adhere to, the love interest material was kept to a severe minimum and left until the very end of the movie - a nice choice, in my opinion.<br /><br />"Eagle Eye" isn't perfect, but the flaws it suffers from are the usual action-movie flaws that can't really be avoided. The super-computer shouldn't be able to tap remotely into so many devices, and I'm pretty sure that you can't remotely blow up power wires on the power grid (why would you program in that particular little ability?). Why is the experimental medicine locked in a time-case (designed to look like a bomb timer) and carried by a security detail, but the government's new powerful explosive is being sent by regular USPS? Why does the super-computer wait until everything goes wrong before attempting a back-up? And there's really no reason other than tragic suspense to have the little boy's trumpet be the trigger for the bomb - if there are speakers in that building, the computer should be able to remotely generate the necessary sound to trigger the explosives. I tried to come up with a "first law" reason for why this wasn't done, but considering how often the super-computer directly kills people, that explanation just doesn't seem to work.<br /><br />I don't know if this movie deserves accolades when compared to every movie ever made, but "Eagle Eye" was definitely the most fun action movie I've seen this year and I'm grateful for that.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I adored this one."></head><body><p>One of the most embracive comedy-dramas I've ever gotten to see. I don't know why I ordered this from Columbia House (it was 25ish bucks at the time) but I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />I can't say enough about it because it has an all-star cast (Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Keanu Reeves (sexy doctor) and Amanda Peet was the love-starved daughter of Diane's.<br /><br />The love in this movie was so misdirected. Amanda's character fell for Jack's and soon, Jack's fell for Diane's. For the longest she kept her guard up and refused to date him cause she was her daughter's ex (very good, Diane) but she gives in.<br /><br />And takes happiness by the ears and has a little fun. They live in one of the nicest beach houses you could possibly imagine, that looks down on the sandy beach.<br /><br />Jack has this heart issue and when he's overactive or having sex, it tends to act up. Amanda and Diane are at his side at the hospital when he has a heart attack but then he recovers.<br /><br />Diane and Jack are soul mates but they don't even know it till the very end. This movie is charming to a tee, very witty and smart. A little sexy is thrown in for good measure also. You get to see Diane naked (Ew) and Jack's but too (Funny).<br /><br />Cover Art: C<br />Story: B+<br />Characters: A<br />Length: B<br />Overall: B+<br /><br />4.1 stars.</p></body></html>

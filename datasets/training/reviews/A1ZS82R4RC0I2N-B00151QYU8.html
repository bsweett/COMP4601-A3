<meta name="summary" content="A Bad Joke"></head><body><p>What a worthless, childish and pretentious movie. It`s supposed to be a satire on catholicism, but is such an inane film that I almost felt pity for it. So this is what a hip, clever, witty movie should be nowadays, eh? Well, in fact it`s just a lame mess. The beginning isn`t bad, Damon and Affleck have a couple of entertaining scenes with some black humour, but it doesn`t last for too long and soon falls into mediocrity. The film seems endless and gets worse from scene to scene. In the end, &quot;Dogma&quot; is a failed parody with a few decent moments and a lot of crap. The characters are flat and uninteresting, the acting bland and the direction shows little creativity. While it's strange, different and offbeat, it doesn`t qualify as being actually something worthwhile and poignant. A letdown.</p></body></html>

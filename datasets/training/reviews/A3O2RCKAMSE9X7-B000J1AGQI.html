<meta name="summary" content="There Were Many 'We's' in WE WERE SOLDIERS"></head><body><p>WE WERE SOLDIERS is one of the most significant war movies of this or any other era. Director Randall Wallace tells the tale of the Seventh Cavalry (Custer's Cavalry) as it fought a numerically superior North Vietnamese Army in a battle that meant nothing in a tactical sense in the Vietnam of 1964.  There are two perspectives.  One is from an American colonel played by Mel Gibson while the other is from his adversary, a Vietcong colonel played straight by Don Duong, without the bucktoothed screechiness of a former generation's Asian army commander. Despite the different uniforms and political philosophies of both Duong and Gibson, they are more alike than each would probably care to admit.  Both are dedicated and experienced leaders of men and neither is willing to allow personal feelings to get in the way of the killing business that is war.  <p>WE WERE SOLDIERS is seemingly no more than the tale of a regiment of soldiers that covers first their training for battle, then later the battle itself.  But as in many war movies, the complexity of the war is only slowly brought into focus.  Director Wallace, in addition to showing the Vietnamese side through many vignettes that parallel the strategy sessions of the Americans also shows the wives and families of the soldiers.  Madeline Stowe is particularly effective as Gibson's wife who knows only all too well that the fortunes of war are sometimes reduced to the cliche of insensate luck as the determining factor in who comes home in one piece and who does not.  It is she who takes on the onerous burden of delivering the telegrams of death to the wives of her husband's soldiers.  The large cast includes a sterling performance by Sam Elliot, as an experienced sergeant-major who helps his men retain both life and sanity in the insanity of hand to hand combat. <p>What emerges as a subtext is the unsettling notion that in combat the enemy often differs more from us by the color of uniform worn than by anything else.  The extremely realistic scenes of bodies being ripped to pieces make the viewer care that some soldiers are being killed by some other soldiers, while not particularly caring about the colors of their uniforms.  The 'We' of WE WERE SOLDIERS is a sobering reminder that we should be glad that killing is so horrible, else we might grow overly fond of it.</p></body></html>

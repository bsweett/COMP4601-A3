It was unlike anything I had seen before as far as non-stop action, great characters and an explosive story. The hero, Bruce Willis, was a wise-cracking, NYPD officer with more guts then brains and the villain, Alan Rickman, was the greatest villain since Jesse James. Well, the years passed on, other films took on the non-stop action sequences rarely as exciting or as well-done as DIE HARD. All the heroes took on the wise-cracking, lovable, tough guy hero. But rarely did any of them approach the fun or intent of DIE HARD. So I took a passing interest in the DIE HARD sequels and recently watched LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD. Well, the beginning was very promising, a story that pulled me in and kept me on the edge of my seat but somewhere about 2/3rds of way through the film it started to lose me. I know it's a DIE HARD film franchise and a DIE HARD film must<br />always try to outdo itself with the explosions and killing and making Bruce Willis look invincible but c'mon they had a really good film going here and it just peters out. The action became too unbelievable, the explosions too unnecessary and the whole story line seemed to fall apart so as we can have one more chase or one more explosion. Hey, you know what you're getting when you watch anything in the DIE HARD series but since when does making a good film take a back seat to entertainment, I though a good film would be more entertaining then mindless action. Also John McClain has gone from regular Joe to some kind of superhero. Maybe, it's just been too long and my tastes have changed.</p></body></html>

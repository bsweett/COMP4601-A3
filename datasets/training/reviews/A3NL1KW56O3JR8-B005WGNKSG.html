<meta name="summary" content="A good adaptation"></head><body><p>Overall, this was a pretty good adaptation of the book. Sure, there are a lot of things missing but they had to streamline a very complicated story into a single film. Despite these omissions, the movie is fairly true to the book. Sure, nobody is going to win any acting awards for this but the books aren't exactly Nobel prize material to begin with. The biggest flaw with the movie is that they under-develop Salander's emotional and/or personality disorders; that's what makes her an interesting character. Even so: good book; good movie.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

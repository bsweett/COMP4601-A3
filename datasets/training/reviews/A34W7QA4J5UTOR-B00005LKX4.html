It is a movie about a cannibal. Anthony Hopkins is good as "Hannibal" again. This time we get more insight into what type of man he is. This movie is both thrilling and amusing. <p>My only worry is that some could see this movie as the glorification of a serial killer. It isn't blatantly said that what "Hannibal" is doing is right in the movie but all the indicators are there. "Hannibal" attacks only people he considers sinners. The majority of these people aren't shown in a favorable light for the viewer. He saves "...." And the ending shows him in a favorable light. He's actually this movie's hero! <p>That said, I still want to see this movie again. It's morbidly fascinating.  I keep recalling all these scenes I would like to see again.  The more I think about it and the more I see the commercials for it, the more I realize how much I liked this movie.</p></body></html>

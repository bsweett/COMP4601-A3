<meta name="summary" content="Jack's out of place here, the script has holes...enjoyable nevertheless"></head><body><p>Casting the romantic comedy...Cameron Diaz? Check. Jude Law? Check. Kate Winslet? Double Check. Jack Black? WTF?  I love Jack Black, but he's seriously out of place here.  Even he doesn't appear to believe he's in the right place.<br /><br />Moreover, you could drive large Caterpillar trucks through the holes in Nancy Meyers' script.  Like how these two ladies actually swapped their houses despite Diaz's character happening upon the web site that very day.  Or, Winslet's character referring to some manual that Diaz's character put together covering the intense electronics in the house...despite the fact the Diaz's character left town in an unplanned state of frenzy.  Or Eli Wallach's character finally agreeing to be feted by his screenwriting peers, then suddenly having the very formal event held like one week later.  There's a long list of "doesn't work" things like that.<br /><br />Despite all that, what can I say - Cameron Diaz is a gifted physical comedienne in the classic Hollywood screwball blonde sort of way, I'd watch Kate Winslet in anything, and Jude Law always looks great on the screen...he's what a movie star ought to be.  And Nancy Meyers - my comments above aside - is someone worthy of respect with her hard work, creativity, vision and success in a male-dominated industry.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The most shocking ending I've ever seen in a horror movie"></head><body><p>There isn't much more to say that what I've stated in the heading of my review. Plus, what others have said in their "mini-dissertations." Who says that all horror movies have to have a happy ending? This one certainly didn't. And it more than leaves you saddened and depressed (it'll wear off); but that is a good thing, because you'll never forget this movie if just for the ending. Wow!<br /><br />Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Laurie Holden, William Sadler, Tobie Jones, Andre Braugher, Frances Sternhagen and the rest of the cast give tension-filled and sometimes maddening performances in this thriller (more so than the actual monsters). Those who think that Marcia Gay Harden as the wacked-out Bible-thumping Mrs. Carmody overdid it, have never been around religious zealots as she portrayed. Believe me, I've gone to churches where there are such self-righteous, "Fire and Brimstone" fanatics all but condemning you to Hell without warning. Which made her character all the more real and frightening.<br /><br />This movie is unforgettable. And Thomas Jane's final scene makes it so.</p></body></html>

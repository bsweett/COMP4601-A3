<meta name="summary" content="Astonishing View into the Events of That Time."></head><body><p>In thinking back over my high school years in the early 50s in Boulder, CO, I must have come into contact with at least 1000 students of that age and I cannot recall knowing of a single homosexual (gay or lesbian). Such matters were just not revealed or discussed, except in bad-taste jokes. My parents and other adults seemed not at all inclined to yield any information about the subject, nor did they point their fingers at any known suspects. I grew up almost totally ignorant and it wasn't until I went to college and graduate school (Boulder, CO, and Seattle, WA, in late 50s and early 60s) that I even became aware that there was such a thing as a gay community (not called gay at the time).<br /><br />Flash forward to the present. I've now attended three San Diego area Gay Pride parades, large festive gatherings attended by thousands of open gays in amusing and outrageous get-ups and gathering thousands and thousands of interested and generally supportive spectators along the way. Oh sure, there are the preachers, angry people carrying placards and police ready to go into riot mode at an instant's notice, but that just adds to the charm and festivity of the gathering. It's a fun annual event. If your community has one, be sure to take it in. It's highly educational and very worth while.<br /><br />Well, the difference certainly marks a radical change in our society and one I never would have anticipated. The change has been gradual over those 60 years and punctuated by killings, beatings, court orders, protests, voting on propositions and what not all. Cultural changes are not easy and this one has been an especially difficult struggle. I've always been on the outside looking in and it represents an extremely interesting period of cultural change.<br /><br />Last night, my wife and I viewed the movie "Milk" on DVD. The story involves Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in the US and the people he was surrounded by and the context of the time they were in. The story took place largely in the Castro District of San Francisco where Milk was elected as a City Supervisor. The movie is stunningly well done. Kudos to director Gus Van Sant. It's done up as a semi-biography in a subdued documentary style. To me, as a total outsider, I would say the movie was fair and balanced. If you have strong views one way or another, you may have a different interpretation. Sean Penn and the rest of the cast do a marvelous job with the acting. The whole story is very believable. I can clearly remember many of the events and people of that time, and I appreciate seeing them put in this context. To me, the movie "Milk" presents an astonishing view into the events of that time.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

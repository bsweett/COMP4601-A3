In 1958, two camp counselors were murdered. In 1962, fires and bad water thwarted the camp's reopening. Now, in 1979, Steve Christy finally reopens Camp Crystal Lake with the help of a few new counselors. Ignoring the warnings from a local wacko, the murders start once again while a mysterious stalker prowls the area. This movie has everything appealing about the 80's horror genre and wraps it up neatly into this fantastic horror package. A classic in it's genre.</p></body></html>

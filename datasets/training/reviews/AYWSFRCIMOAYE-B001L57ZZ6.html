<meta name="summary" content="It's an one-eyed eagle."></head><body><p>It's an one-eyed eagle. It copied all the ideas from other science fiction films. Then it added many special effects. The plot is absurd because it's so illogical. The action is non-stop but it's so far-fetched that I don't feel suspenseful or excited at all. It's because I've seen them all before.<br /><br />I paid for a matinee ticket to this movie but I still think it's a waste of time and money.</p></body></html>

And like Juno herself, the film outgrows its own mannerisms and defenses, evolving from a coy, knowing farce into a heartfelt, serious comedy." A.O.Scott<br /><br />Juno, played by Ellen Page, is the 16 year old heroine of this film, was named after one of the Roman Gods. In this case, it fits this character explicitly. Juno is one of the more mature 16 year old in this universe. After 3 pregnancy tests and a gallon of orange drink she accepts the fact that she is pregnant. She considers aborting but rules that out quickly. She confides in her close friend, and they look for suitable parents and find them in the local Penny-Saver.  Juno then sets the stage for her parents who are supportive and loving. J K Simmons plays her dad and Allison Janey her step mom.  They are not saccharine sweet but realistic and realize they have an independent and capable young woman in Juno. Her boyfriend Bleeker, Michael Cera, gives his support and in his way is there for her.  Her best friend, played by Olivia Thirlby, is the kind you gotta have, Dude.<br /><br />It took me half an hour of listening to smart, cool language, Dude, to realize I was indoctrinated quickly into the culture of this film. The film is not about pro or con abortion or any legal or moral message. It just is. Juno is pregnant after unprotected sex, and everyone comes together to accept what is happening.  The to-be parents played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are just the right mix until one of them decides this is not to be. Juno is in all honesty the most mature of this bunch-she guides the adults in her direction and nothing will upset her path. The soundtrack is great- a mix of the most quirky music out there- but you find yourself humming along and tapping your toes.<br /><br />"Part whip-smart teen comedy, part drama, backed by a quirky soundtrack and the most subtle comic performance by a youngster in years, Juno is a rare feel-good film in the morose pack of Oscar contenders." Jim Slotek<br /><br />I had no real wish to view this film, but was told by friends that it was a a winner, and it is. I loved the film. Got kind of teary at the end and the fresh approach by the writer Diablo Cody kept my attention.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 04-20-08<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GI3KGC">Hard Candy</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000060MWS">Switching Goals</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Truly Surprised Me"></head><body><p>I did not think I would like this film.  Before I finally saw it, there was just something about it that reeked of pretension.  Not sure why, but that's how I felt.  When I finally did get around to seeing it, I was blown away.  So tragic in a stupid, senseless, pridefull way that it really hit me hard.  Entertaining - not really.  Riveting -yes.  The performances here are amazing. A real actors' film - similar to the way I reacted to Mystic River.  It made me angry, depressed, sad - and I could not stop watching it.  The biggest win for me was the fact that all of the characters were in a way stupid or blinded by their experiences, the environment, the timing of the situation, laziness - all of that and more.  In fact, I did not and could not root for anyone, but I still understood them all.  Pride, tradition, self-destruction, sloth, and anger all add up to tragic consequences.  Not a movie I would watch again for entertainment value - but it packs a punch.</p></body></html>

This is actually a pretty decent horror film.  Flawed, to be sure, but I still liked it and could overlook its shortcomings....<br />The beginning was rough; it felt like a movie of the week melodrama.  The town drunk shows up at a ballgame loaded for bear: to shoot or not to shoot?  His widow giving the sheriff a halfhearted slap didn't help the pervasive sense of hesitancy on the part of the director.  Pick a genre, it's not that difficult: horror or something limp and whiny.  Eventually, they found the right tone and things began to percolate.  It also helped that there were three solid leads playing the most important characters: Radha Mitchell, Timothy Olyphant, and especially Joe Anderson as the loyal deputy.  It was caring about these people that made this movie work (an element sorely missing in the original movie).  The stand out scenes were: sewing in the morgue, the bedroom battle where the sheriff gets a good grip on a knife, the carwash, and the truck stop.<br />Not as appreciated were the endless walking scenes, the throwaway piece with the major, the BOO type scares, and some of the connecting scenes that made little sense time-wise.  Also, if you're on the run from someone, don't go walking down the middle of the highway in broad daylight!<br />I do think they could have done more with the herding of the townspeople into trucks and hauling them away, but that's a minor point.  I'm just glad they finally picked a direction and went for it.<br />It's a keeper (the original was not).</p></body></html>

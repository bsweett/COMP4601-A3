While it was a visual feast with impressive special effects, I felt that Snyder used those visuals as a crutch to support a rather dull plot.  The actual historical account of the battle at Thermopylae was, to me, a much better story than Snyder's film or Frank Miller's graphic novel.<br /><br />With that said, I wasn't expecting much from Snyder's "Watchmen."  Based on the comic series by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, I thought that it would be just another special effects-laden, plotless film.  I was quite surprised.<br /><br />What Snyder has done is take a very good story and give it an excellent treatment on film.  From recreating panels with near perfection from the comics and retaining the bulk of the story, Snyder has outdone himself.<br /><br />The plot of the film revolves around the murder of one superhero, the Comedian, and the attempts of another, Rorshach, to discover the culprit.  Rorshach tries to drag other former heroes out of retirement with mixed results at first.  Eventually he gets Nite Owl II to help him in his quest.  Another pair of heroes, Silk Spectre II and Dr. Manhattan, also become involved, but they primarily struggle with themselves.  Silk Spectre is trying to find a reason to stay with Dr. Manhattan despite his becoming increasingly detached from her.  Dr. Manhattan has become bored with humanity and also accused of giving cancer to some of his colleagues and spends much of the film in solitude on Mars.  Another former hero, the very public Ozymandias, would rather keep his distance on all matters.<br /><br />As expected, Snyder does provide excellent special effects.  In fact, they are some of the best I've seen in the last couple of years.  Even the perpetually blue-glowing Dr. Manhattan looks rather convincing on the screen.<br /><br />Jackie Earle Haley rises above the rest of the cast as Rorshach, the primary catalyst in the film.  He keeps the tale interesting throughout.  He's a tortured soul intent on finding the murderer of his former ally.  Patrick Wilson does an excellent job as the depressed Nite Owl II, who's all but thrown in the towel on being a superhero.  He's somewhat like Batman had Bruce Wayne quit hitting the gym and became a homebody.  Billy Crudup does a good job as Dr. Manhattan, giving a cold and nearly emotionless performance.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays the rather unlikeable Comedian, who appears primarily in flashbacks.  He's a disgusting jerk and quite possibly the ultimate anti-hero.  Carla Gugino portrays the original Silk Spectre, and shines as a drunken, washed-up former hero.<br /><br />The only real disappointments in the acting department were Matthew Goode and Malin Akerman.  Goode just wasn't believable as the super-intelligent old soul called Ozymandias.  His performance was very flat.  Still, he wasn't as bad as Malin Akerman, who delivers a wooden and emotionless performance as Silk Spectre II.  Akerman comes across as a likeable person in real life, but I felt that she wasn't the right person for this particular role.<br /><br />Despite the subpar efforts of Goode and Akerman, I felt that "Watchmen" was a very good film.  Loyal to the source material, full of tormented characters, and giving the viewer a very unique spin on the mythos of superheroes, I highly recommend "Watchmen."  It's a definite purchase for fans of the comic serial and anyone who enjoys an excellent mystery or solid action.</p></body></html>

Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The video quality was excellent.  The item description above says it is 2.40:1, but before I read that, I thought it was 2.35:1.<br /><br />The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was also excellent - lot's of surround sounds and sub-woofer bass.<br /><br />The movie lasted about 1 hour and 47 minutes.  I thought it was pretty good, except for the ending, which I thought was incomplete.</p></body></html>

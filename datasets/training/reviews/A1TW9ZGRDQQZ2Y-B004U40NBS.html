The more I think back on it, the better it becomes. Yes, this is an art-house type of film and like the other movies from director, Darren Aronofsky, it has no problem strolling into some very weird territory. The Wrestler is the most mainstream we have gotten from Aronofsky so far and it was my favorite movie of his until today. I know Requiem for a Dream has a lot of fans and I admire the it, though watching it is close to torture because it's just that realistic and disturbing, but Black Swan is head and shoulders above everything I have seen so far this year, save for Inception.<br /><br />The acting is exceptional all around. Everybody just fits into place perfectly. Natalie Portman is flat out jaw dropping as the obsessive and uptight Nina. Not only is her acting better than any other actress I've seen in a long time, but her physical transformation is just as astonishing. Dropping 20 pounds off an already small frame and doing 90% of the dancing is no small feat. She better get an Oscar! Mila Kunis is also good in a smaller than expected role as her rival. Portman's Nina is cold and childish, while Kunis brings sensuality and seductiveness to her part. Vincent Cassel, Barabara Hershey and Winona Ryder make up the rest of the strong supporting cast.<br /><br />Other than the acting, the cinematography and music elevate what would normally be rather boring scenes into something unique and interesting.<br /><br />If you are anything like I was when I first heard about Black Swan and the ballet setting, you'll be missing out on the thriller/horror elements that turn this thing dark and messy. Sure the ballet is a major part of the film, but there are many other layers.<br /><br />Black Swan has regained my faith in modern cinema. It's so nice to have an original filmmaker with new ideas in the age of something as awful as Little Fockers. I'm looking forward to see what he has up his sleeve for us next.</p></body></html>

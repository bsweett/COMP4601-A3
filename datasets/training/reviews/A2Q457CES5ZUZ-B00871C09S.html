<meta name="summary" content="A Voyeuristic Masterpiece"></head><body><p>&quot;Rear Window&quot; and &quot;Vertigo&quot; have been referred to as Alfred Hitchcock's voyeuristic masterpieces with good reason.  The latter film relates to Jimmy Stewart playing a retired detective determined to make another woman into someone he believed had previously existed but never did, and was only a fictitious creation of her lover, who was a clever murderer.  Kim Novak, in one of her early efforts, played the dual role with just the proper measure of ethereal distance.<p>Four years before &quot;Vertigo&quot; previewed Hitchcock directed another powerful voyeuristic film with Stewart cast in the male lead, this time opposite another blonde bombshell, the future princess Grace Kelly.  Based on a story by master thriller author Cornell Woolrich, &quot;Rear Window&quot; is about a successful photographer who, after breaking his leg in an accident while covering an automobile race, is laid up in his Manhattan apartment.  In between visits from gorgeous socialite Kelly he whiles away his time observing his neighbors from the apartment building behind his own, separated by a courtyard.<p>Stewart lives as a voyeur, spending his time observing people like Miss Lonelyhearts, the woman who fixes herself candlelight dinners she shares with wine and music with imaginary love interests, a composer constantly at work at his piano, and a seductively constructed ballet dancer with a seemingly unending host of male admirers.  Kelly becomes concerned over his interest in observing the ballet dancer.<p>Eventually Stewart becomes preoccupied, however, with another neighbor, the husky, white-haired Raymond Burr, several years away from his future starring role in the Perry Mason television detective series.  Stewart notices that Burr's wife is ill and confined to bed.  He then becomes increasingly preoccupied with Burr's comings and goings at various hours of the night.  At first Kelly tells him he is concerned over nothing.  He then attracts her interest, and finally that of his detective friend and former World War Two Air Force buddy Wendell Corey.<p>Just what is happening?  Are their imaginations overworked?  The finale is spelled out in typical Hitchcock fashion, after he has worked his audience's curiosity to overpowering levels.  Hitchcock seemingly loved little, if anything, more than tweaking his audience.  The curiosity grows and grows until the finale.<p>The color and camera work are spectacular.  We stare into the lives of individuals who are unaware of the fact that we are there.  That is, until Raymond Burr begins to suspect something.  At that point the story moves into high gear, all the way to its compelling climax.</p></body></html>

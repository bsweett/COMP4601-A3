<meta name="summary" content="Country Fried Movie"></head><body><p>I don't know what went wrong.  I thought this was a no brainer (no pun intended).  I almost bought it without seeing it first. Thank goodness for $1.00 rentals. "No Country For Old Men" (what does that mean anyways?) didn't live up to my expectations.  Because I love "Fargo" and "The Man Who Wasn't There", I thought this latest installment of a Coen Brothers film would blow me away.  The film just got too evil for me and too creepy.  The characters were bizarre and reprehensible so I wasn't too interested in the story that went along with it.  I like Josh Brolin, he was the best part of the movie for me.  Javier Bardem's character just creeped me out in a bad way, maybe it was the hair, who knows.  The quirkiness of The Coen Brothers films was missing here and when the characters tried to be quirky, it didn't work in that genuine way.  Like why the scene with the teenage boys selling their shirt?  That scene was borderline inappropriate, like we need to see a shirtless teenage boy, the movie could of done without.  The scenes with Tommy Lee Jones bored me to tears and then out of nowhere the movie stopped.  Credits rolled and I just chalked it up as a loss.  Very dissapointed. Now I wish Hal Holbrook would have won the oscar for supporting actor, and "There Will Be Blood" or "Into The Wild" should have won for best picture.  No country for me, I'll leave it at that.</p></body></html>

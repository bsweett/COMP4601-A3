In other words, it's another combination of the old-fashioned vampire movie with the butt-kicking martial-arts extravaganza.  So if you liked the first one, you should have no problem getting into the sequel.  Of course, since "Blade 2" IS an action sequel, everything from the original has to get turned up a notch (or ten).  As a result, the fight scenes are more frenetic, the violence more graphic, the enemies more dangerous, and the special effects more extravagant.  The first "Blade" was very impressive visually, but this one makes it look like the original "Dracula."  That said, the unremittingly bleak look and feel of the original is very well preserved in the sequel.  Since the vampire-hunting plot of "Blade" wouldn't have been as impressive in a sequel, this movie finds Blade hunting an even more fearsome foe: genetically engineered SUPER vampires!  That's right, Blade (reunited with Whistler and teamed with an elite crew of "regular" vampires) now has to take on a gang of "reapers" who are even stronger and more bloodthirsty than regular vampires, not to mention immune to silver and garlic.  Pretty scary.  Naturally, the plot stops for a killer fight scene every ten minutes or so, and the choreography and cinematography are enough to rival that of "The Matrix."  It's all pretty far-fetched, but it does make for escapist entertainment at its finest.  And since "Blade 2" was gangbusters at the box office, hopefully they'll be getting a third installment out there soon.  Wesley Snipes has been all but typecast as an action hero by now anyway, so he might as well go with it.</p></body></html>

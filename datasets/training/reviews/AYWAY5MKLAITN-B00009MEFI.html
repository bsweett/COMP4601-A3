<meta name="summary" content=""Don't even think of leaving that Phone Booth.""></head><body><p>This, along with CELLULAR and RED EYE, makes for a perfect trilogy of suspense.<br /><br />But this one has a style all it's own.<br /><br />Gritty New York Characters, Creepingly sinister voice on the other end, mastered by Keifer Sutherland, and suspense.<br /><br />This particular Killer likes holding a high-powered rifle in one of the surrounding buildings while his victum struggles to stay calm standing in one spot. He forces the Victum to see the consequences of all the stupid choices and weak ones in his life.<br /><br />A real nail biter.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></body></html>

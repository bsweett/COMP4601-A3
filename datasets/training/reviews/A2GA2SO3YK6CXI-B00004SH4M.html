James Bond is a fictional character created by writer Ian Fleming in 1953 while he vacationed in his Jamaican property by the name of Golden-eye.<br /><br />The James Bond movies capture the action and romance found in the books by the author and surfaced a world of espionage, gadgets, secret weapons, beautiful women and amazing cars. The success of Sean Connery created an image so powerful that still to today, it is thought as that of the best Bond character.<br /><br />By the time the third movie "Goldfinger" was released most people were already addicted to the smart sayings of Bond... "My name if Bond, James Bond;" "Shaken, not stirred" and so many others. Goldfinger incorporated unforgettable bits: "Do you want me to talk? [Goldfinger] No, I just want you to die!"<br /><br />With Goldfinger, the plot is to take over the ultimate Gold bank, Fort Knox and while the movie is not filmed at that location, a replica is created and we almost believe we are visiting it. Without a doubt, this is one of the best Bond movies.<br /><br />Living in South Florida, it was fun to see the film open up in Miami Beach as Goldfinger, played by Gert Frobe, a gold tycoon plays cards with a man while a woman watches through binoculars from his hotel room and tells him what to play.<br /><br />Bond discovers what he is doing and tells Goldfinger, who does not like to lose, that he better allow the man to recover what he has lost or he will get the authorities involved. Jill Masterson, played by Shirley Eaton, has the role of the assistant who gets killed by skin asphyxiation [body is covered with gold paint] because she helps and allows herself to be seduced by Bond.<br /><br />Soon, Bond is told that he needs to discover how the gold is transported by Goldfinger but Oddjob, an overpowering mute played by Harold Sakata, who works for Goldfinger, lets Bond know that it will not be easy to come up against his boss. Oddjob has a steel rimmed hat that is a lethal weapon and he soon demonstrates his powerful skills to Bond by decapitating a statue on the golf course they are visiting.<br /><br />Bond discovers that Goldfinger is planning an "Operation Grand Slam" with the ultimate goal of taking over the gold stored at Fort Knox. He plans to have nerve gas released by planes flown over the site while his men are using oxygen masks.<br /><br />As Bond is transported by Goldfinger's personal pilot "Pussy Galore," unforgettably played by Honor Blackman to his Kentucky farm, another famous line is exchanged because, upon hearing her name Bond says... "I must be dreaming!"<br /><br />The scenes are smart, the plot is fascinating, the technology used in cars, airplanes, and weapons... leading edge for the times, thus Goldfinger became a favorite of audiences the world over.</p></body></html>

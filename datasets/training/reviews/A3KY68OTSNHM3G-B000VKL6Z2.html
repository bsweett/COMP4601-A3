<meta name="summary" content="A Very Good Remake"></head><body><p>Rob Zombie has done a very good job in remaking one of horror's most classic films.  Seldom do remakes live up to the original, but this scary film comes very close and adds in some extras along the way.<br /><br />Unlike the original Halloween, Zombie's version starts out with the entire Myers family.  Young Michael (Daeg Faerch) is constantly tormented by other children at school.  They make fun of his stripper mom Deborah Myers (Sheri Moon Zombie) and his promiscuous sister. Deborah's slob of a boyfriend Ronnie White (William Forsythe) spends his days lying on the couch and hurling insults at the rest of the family.  The only person that Michael is somewhat close to is his baby sister.<br /><br />One day, the tormenting from the other children goes too far, and Michael snaps.  One child is killed, and Michael then kills his sister, her boyfriend, and Ronnie on Halloween night.  His mother finds him holding his baby sister on the steps outside the house.<br /><br />Michael is put on trial, found guilty, and sentenced to a mental hospital.  At the hospital, Michael is placed under the care of Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell).  At first, Dr. Loomis sees Michael as a troubled child who has no recollection of what he has done.  He longs to go home to be with his mother.  But, as time passes, Michael slips deeper and deeper into a shell.  He begins wearing masks constantly and soon, he snaps again.  More people are killed, Michael escapes, and he heads back to Haddonfield to claim his last victim; his young sister Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton), who was adopted after Michael's earlier killing spree.<br /><br />The events after this point unfold pretty much the same as they did in John Carpenter's original Halloween.  There are some subtle differences but, for the most part, Zombie follows the original very closely until the end, which is very different from the original.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Carpenter's Halloween movies, and I was anxious to see how this version compared to the earlier ones.  I was very impressed with Zombie's film.  What I liked most about this movie was the look into Michael Myers' early life and how he became the madman he turned out to be.  Unlike the beginning of Carpenter's film, where the viewer only sees Michael killing his sister, Zombie spends almost an hour of film time setting the stage for Michael's slide from a troubled child to maniacal killer.  He also makes the viewer feel somewhat sympathetic for Michael, due to his troubled upbringing by a mom who works as a stripper and a deadbeat boyfriend.<br /><br />I recommend this movie very highly.  Rob Zombie has taken a classic horror film and reworked it in such a way as to make it almost better than the original.  I still prefer Carpenter's version over Zombie's, but this scary movie is definitely worth watching.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Does Anyone Else Feel This Movie Is Overrated?"></head><body><p>This is a movie that has gotten glowing reviews. IMO, it is a love it or hate it movie. I didn't really enjoy it much because, to put it plainly, it bored me to death. The movie drags on at a realistically paced soap opera. I admit the acting was decent and the story was alright, but it was really boring. I would definitely not watch this again, even on a boring rainy day with green eggs and ham.<br /><br />Problems:<br /><br />1. The plot of the movie isn't really complex. I won't say it since it'll spoil it for you.<br /><br />2. The love scenes and love relationship in general feels more like a fetish reenactment or a spare the moment "I haven't gotten any for a long time" kind of thing. The love never really hits a believable level where you're like "yeah, they really care for each other even without the sex". Sex is the limit of their love. I know the movie tries to portray it differently but come on now every time they meet there's always some sexual encounter. They never really build their relationship much past that point.<br /><br />3. The movie was extremely static and slow paced. If I was ever to be tortured, watching this movie again would probably be the finishing move.....<br /><br />4. Have anyone noticed that the characters don't really change physically even though they said it's been about 20 years or so? In the end when BLANK met his daughter, the daughter almost looked like his wife, the dad and the daughter looked almost the same age!<br /><br />5. No satisfactory conclusion. I guess that's how it works in real life but again it goes back to the pretty static plot. You would think that there's some sort of better resolve in the end, but it just feels like the whole moral of the movie was "love sucks, don't get into it or you'll be like US (echo effect).<br /><br />I was seriously bored out of my mind. I just thought there would be something that would make this movie more rewatchable or rather....watchable at all. It just bored me to death. I'm very open to different types of movies, but yeah...<br /><br />My thoughts are: I think the only reason this movie got so much attention and overexaggeration is because of one single thing. HEATH LEDGER. Well, that and of course because it stands for homosexuality and the ever growing community which supports it WHICH probably explains the ratings.</p></body></html>

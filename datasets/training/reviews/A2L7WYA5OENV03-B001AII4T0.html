Great recreation of how CIA's upper management will call in favors from retired individuals off the record.  Ben Affleck did surprisingly well, just don't try to create a logical timeline of all the Clancy films.  I think the Jack Ryan CIA analyst character is just an archetype, because in each film it's the first time he's ever had to go "operational".  Though a lot of critics have thought it didn't realistically deal with the topic of radiation, it was actually fine.  Those are the same Hollywood critics who think Independence Day's obsession with nuclear winter was warranted.  And yes, the Russians are fully capable of attacking a US carrier using their low-level flight techniques.  I particularly enjoyed the sight of anti-missile artillery automatically knocking down a couple of those anti-ship missiles. The running out of the stadium, detonation, and subsequent scenes of the US Marines retrieving the president were breathtaking.  This film's a serious contender for Best of the Genre.</p></body></html>

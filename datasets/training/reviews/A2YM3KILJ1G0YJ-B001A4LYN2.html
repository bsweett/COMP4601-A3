<meta name="summary" content="A drama as dark as oil"></head><body><p>Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis) is a nearly emotionless man, a business first prospector and oil man who will do whatever it takes to be rich.  He comes off at times a bit possessed by the concerns and desires of becoming a filthy rich oil baron, at others a somewhat caring man, including his son H.W. Plainview in nearly all his business meetings and speeches with land-owners.<br /><br />A mysterious young boy comes to Plainview one day with tales of cheap oil land for sale in California.  He seems interested in a quick buck, but also willing to hand over the whereabouts of land that could provide Plainview untold riches.<br /><br />The small town Plainview was told about is Little Boston, and therein lives Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), a very contradictory man.  Pious yet greedy, interested in the church's prosperity but also his own stardom, perhaps a televangelist before the advent of television, Eli yearns for the power that Daniel already has and demands from others.<br /><br />The movie does a great job of displaying the incredibly harsh, dangerous life of a miner at the turn of the last century.  In this trying environment, a man will do anything for what he covets.  The juxtaposition of two powerhouse characters, who seemingly share aspirations as well as vices, is destined from the very beginning to cause a clash of wills.  Once each character is made to publicly display their flaws - Daniel's failures as a father and Eli's blasphemous nature - there is no turning back.<br /><br />There Will Be Blood is a good movie, but it's not as great as it's made out to be.  It gained Hollywood's flavor of the month shortly after its release, and Daniel Day Lewis is the best of his career and deserving of every accolade, but it's far too slow in short spells for it to be a truly epic movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Fine Science Fiction Film"></head><body><p>Prometheus marks Ridley Scott's first science-fiction film since Blade Runner 30 years ago and returns to the universe of his seminal, 1979 masterpiece <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00498VS1E">Alien</a>. The question over whether or not this is actually a prequel to Alien (as was originally intended) has been thoroughly exhausted at this point and ultimately irrelevant. You need not have seen any other film to appreciate, admire, and enjoy Scott's latest sci-fi venture. Prometheus takes place in the same universe and references Scott's earlier film, but it really does function as a stand-alone film. With a budget somewhere between $120 and $130 million, there is little to separate Prometheus from a typical summer blockbuster. What ultimately does separate it is Ridley Scott, a man gifted in making big films with big ideas. There is enough action and visual effects to please the average moviegoer, but Prometheus is backed by an intelligent script that asks a lot of questions, answers few of them, and gives us something to ponder instead of just mindlessly blowing things up. Take that, Michael Bay.<br /><br />The hypnotic opening sequence (shot in Iceland) shows a humanoid alien standing above a waterfall, drinking a mysterious liquid that induces vomiting and rapid decay. This scene is ambiguous in that it gives us no information about where he is, what he is, and or what the implications of this moment are. It intrigues us for a moment, before the film jump cuts to the year 2089. Here, archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) has discovered a star map among wall paintings from several unrelated cultures that she views as an invitation from the Engineers that may have created human life. Funded by Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation, Shaw and a crew embark on a voyage to the distant moon LV-223 aboard the vessel Prometheus. Travelling in stasis and monitored by the android David (Michael Fassbender), they arrive in 2093 and embark on their mission to find their creators.<br /><br />Despite taking place in the same universe as Alien, the world created by the extravagant sets in Prometheus evoke a world all its own. The sets are intricately designed, large-scale creations; early contenders for the best set design Academy Award next year. Scott masterfully blends large sets, special effects, and good location scouting to create an atmospheric new world. If Prometheus offered nothing else by way of quality, it's an amazing film to look at.<br /><br />It recalls Alien most noticeably in that both have a strong female protagonist and both emphasize patient, slow-burning suspense, atmosphere, and an intelligent script that equally balances a complex narrative with beautifully integrated special effects. Prometheus does not jump directly in to the action. You'll be intrigued before you'll be amazed. In a genre that frequently allows acting prowess to take a backseat to hyperkinetic imagery, you'll find some fine performances here too.<br /><br />Fassbender, always the fascinating actor, wonderfully captures the ambiguous emotions of his android character. His performance is sophisticated, robotic, and yet layered with depth. It's as if HAL-9000 had assumed the look of T.S. Lawrence and was allowed to freely wander the ship. It's a performance that hurtles him ever-closer to the A-list. Rapace makes a strong, sensitive substitute for Sigourney Weaver and Charlize Theron sternly embodies a character that metaphorically holds the entire narrative subtext together.<br /><br />Prometheus is imperfect, but these flaws are few and far between. Sure, fanboys may find fault with how it works chronologically with Alien (despite the fact that it's not a prequel officially), but my issues come from two much different aspects. One is Guy Pearce's makeup. When compared to the seamless visual effects, his makeup seems unconvincing and overdone. Granted, I didn't initially recognize Pearce, but I also didn't believe that Peter Weyland was an elderly man. Another issue comes from something I've already praised; the script. As intelligent and thought-provoking as it is, it doesn't offer anything new by way of story structure. It follows the template seen in Alien and more recently in Sunshine (as well as, I assume, several movies in-between). It just follows too many cues that the seasoned moviegoer will recognize right away (establish reason for mission, upon arrival there's a change in the mission, the characters begin exploring, ominous things happen, characters get scared and die unbeknownst to the others, etc.). Sure, writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof have fashioned something spectacular, but it wouldn't hurt to break from the template and create something wholly new.<br /><br />Minor issues aside, it's terrific summer entertainment and a roaring return for Ridley Scott to the genre in which he made his name. Prometheus is a terrific film and one of the better high-minded science-fiction films to emerge from Hollywood in several years. It has suspense, horror, intelligence, drama, and depth typically eschewed in favor of a special effects extravaganza during Hollywood blockbuster season.</p></body></html>

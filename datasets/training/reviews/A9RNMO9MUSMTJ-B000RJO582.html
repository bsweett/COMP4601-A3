<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good remake"></head><body><p>The unrated director's version is the one that i have.<br />Great movie, but not as great as the Romero version.  Some of the<br />zombie scenes felt like that crappo 28 days zombie movie... which<br />is edited a la mvt video style, and  some of the ending scenes are filmed in high speed shutter in which gives out a feeling not as satisfying as the original movie.<br />Saying that, i can say that i recommend this movie to anybody that<br />like zombies movies...and the bonus is that this movie has a good<br />budget its characters are interesting....it wont let you down..it'l just try to take a bite out of you..........</p></body></html>

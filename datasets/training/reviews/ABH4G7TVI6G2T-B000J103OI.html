Some hideous skirt convention you have to go to?""></head><body><p>THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is a sinfully delicious comedy set in the cut-throat New York fashion industry.  When journalist Andie Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is hired as the new assistant to Runway Magazine editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the stage is set for a a legendary culture (or should that be couture?) clash!  Miranda Priestly--inspired by Anna Wintour, renowned editor of Vogue--is one of the most fascinating characters that Ms Streep has ever played on the screen and she really tries to give some depth to Miranda's life away from the spotlight.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway, fast becoming the Audrey Hepburn for Gen. Y., has another of her trademark "ugly duckling to Cinderella" transformations with her role as Andie.  Stealing every scene is the amazing Emily Blunt, playing Miranda's flinty main assistant; plus Stanley Tucci as one of the catty Runway designers.  A modern classic.<br /><br />I've compared the Blu-ray disc to the earlier DVD release and the difference is literally night and day.  Extras include audio commentary with the filmmakers and deleted scenes.  This particular BD disc is encoded for playback in regions A through C.</p></body></html>

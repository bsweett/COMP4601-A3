I particularly admire director Yimou Zhang's use of color as a way to propel the story forward: color as a narrative as well as a design device.<br /><br />The plot is told in several versions with different characters giving their version of the story, "Rashomon" style. Nameless (Jet Li) is the catalyst for all of the action and the transcendent Ziyi Zhang (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and Maggie Cheung (In the Mood for Love) add beauty and class to the proceedings.<br /><br />"Hero" is a gorgeous film, breathtaking in its visuals and unique storytelling and a triumph for all concerned.</p></body></html>

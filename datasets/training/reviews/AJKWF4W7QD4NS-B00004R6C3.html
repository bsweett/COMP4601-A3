Carpenter's favorite actor, Kurt Russell stars as one of a group of scientists that discover the body of an alien being frozen in the arctic for thousands of years.  What unfolds is that the alien can take any form it chooses, and what results is some very gory images and disturbing scenes (courtesy of Rob Bottin with some of the best makeup ever used in a movie, especially considering this was made 20 years ago), and there is a lot of suspense and tension, giving the movie a very eerie atmosphere as well.  While some consider the ending a bit of a letdown, there really was no other way to end it (except the alternate ending talked about in the making of special feature), and this remains one of Carpenter's better films.  The special features of the DVD are a nice touch as well.</p></body></html>

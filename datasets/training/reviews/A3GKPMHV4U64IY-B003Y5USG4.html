This is a movie about some tornado chasers and the biggest storm system on record.<p>A group of tornado chasers are out to test a new device that will provide researches with enough data to give a fifteen-minute tornado warning (as opposed to the current three-minute warning).  There is a rush to succeed as an evil associate with lots of funding has stolen the idea and is out to get the data first.  Throw in some special effects tornados and the result is Twister.<p>On the side of the good guys is a researcher who has an almost-psychic link with tornados and is thus able to predict their paths better than any instruments.  But then you have the common problem of scale that occurs when special effects are added to live footage.  Half-a-mile looks pretty small in this film.  Half-a-mile is the supposed diameter of the film's final funnel cloud.  Unlike Crichton's other films of this nature, the scientific breakthrough is not lost at the end and therefore the film fails to fit the real world.  But despite these things, this is a edge-of-the-seat, white-knuckle film.  If you like action and tension then this is a film to see.  While, in my opinion, the story is very implausible, the movie succeeds in affecting the audience as planned and that is a rare thing.  So I have to recommend this movie to those who have not seen it.</p></body></html>

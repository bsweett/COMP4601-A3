Or at least, it set into motion one of the premises, which is somewhat annoying. This is an action/horror/science fiction film that's overly condensed and needlessly complicated, with an intricate structure that was improperly handled. What we have here is a rare case: a movie that actually needed an extra thirty minutes for every plot point to be clear and resolvable. There's no point in criticizing the heavy stunts, the excessive gore, and the unrealistic story; I expected nothing less from an adaptation of a video game. But when it comes to character development, pacing, and stability, there is something to complain about.<br /><br />The film opens the same way that many films starring Milla Jovovich do: by her awakening half naked in a strange place, confused but able to stay in control. Her character, Alice, now finds herself lying on the floor of a shower, wearing nothing but a plastic curtain. She then dons a red dress and attempts to escape; based on the sterile hallways and the advanced technology, it's clear that she's once again being held at the Umbrella Corporation's research facility, a laboratory built deep under Raccoon City. As she reaches a doorway, she's gunned down by a cleverly hidden booby trap. We're meant to think that the main character has already been killed off, but wait a minute--her body is dumped in an open grave filled with Alices, each one wearing the same red dress. Somehow, our genetically altered heroine has been cloned, and the ones that die end up in a mass grave.<br /><br />At this point, we're given an insightful (if brief) update as to the state of things, courtesy of Alice's narration. Apparently, the Umbrella Corporation's attempt to quarantine Raccoon city and eradicate the dreaded T Virus failed. It actually managed to spread throughout the entire world. Remember that the T Virus can re-animate dead tissue and mutate living tissue, in essence turning anything it infects into a flesh-eating zombie; an epidemic of this scale has collapsed governments and laid waste to heavily populated cities. The virus has also destroyed plant life and lakes, meaning that the earth is now a planet of desert continents. The world as we knew it is over.<br /><br />Those that survived have learned to stay on the move, because remaining in one area will only attract the infected. This is how we find Alice; she travels alone across the deserts of the Western United States on a motorcycle, stopping only for gas, weapons, and an encounter with a sadistic family of mutant-dog owners. We also meet a mobile group lead by Claire (Ali Larter), a dedicated, efficient young woman. Joining her are "Apocalypse" survivors Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) and L.J. (Mike Epps). They reunite with Alice as they're being attacked by a swarm of infected crows; it would seem that her genetic modifications have allowed for supernatural powers, such as forming force fields and spreading fire. How these powers developed is never adequately explained, but whatever the reason, she uses both abilities to save the remaining group.<br /><br />That's when they decide to head for Alaska, a state so isolated that it's possibly not infected. But before they can make such a long, difficult journey, they have to stop for supplies. And since every small town has been drained of its resources, they're forced to rely on a major city, which is most likely swarming with zombies. They settle for Las Vegas, which has since been consumed by the desert.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back at the Umbrella Corporation, the overdriven Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen) is desperately trying to track Alice down. Because her body has been able to tolerate the T Virus, he believes that her blood is the key to finding a cure, one that may be able to "domesticate" the infected. Unfortunately, his slew of Alice clones has failed to be effective. Effective in what way, I'm not entirely sure; I still haven't figured out why they were needed in the first place. There might have been an explanation hidden somewhere in the film, but with a story this dense and meandering, I can't help but believe that I missed a couple of things.<br /><br />Such with the way with "Resident Evil: Extinction," an overly ambitious film that tried to fit too much into too small a space. The battle sequences are fun, and the makeup effects make for more than a few genuinely frightening moments. Milla Jovovich gives yet another decent performance as an action heroine (although I'm beginning to wonder if she's capable of playing any other role). Missing from the equation is a cohesive, well-developed story, something adequately suited for a film only ninety-five minutes long. When the fourth film is released--since the end of "Extinction" makes it clear that Alice's story is far from over--I can only hope that the vague plot points and unanswered questions will be dealt with. Of course, I'll also be wondering if the story will ever come to an end; movies like this prove that words like "extinction" have no finality to them whatsoever.</p></body></html>

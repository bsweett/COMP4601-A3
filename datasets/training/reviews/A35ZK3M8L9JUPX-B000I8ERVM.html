<meta name="summary" content="The Exorcism of Emily Rose (Special Edition)"></head><body><p>The nineteen years old Catholic college girl Emily Rose dies a couple of days after being submitted to an exorcism carried out by her parish priest, Father Moore. Emily believed she was possessed by six demons, and although authorized by Emily and he parents, Father Moore is accused of negligent homicide, since he had suggested Emily to interrupt the use of medications for epilepsy. In order to avoid a scandal, the Archdiocese hires the successful, ambitious and agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner, and the prosecution assigns the religious prosecutor Ethan Thomas. Along the days, there is a battle between science and religion in the court. There are some very interesting scenes in this movie, that find ways to express things in subtle and creative ways without spelling them out. And an incredible performance by Jennifer Carpenter. This is not a full-blooded horror movie, but definitely one of the most unsettling, disturbing and thought-provoking dramas, seeing Emily possessed is terrifying. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

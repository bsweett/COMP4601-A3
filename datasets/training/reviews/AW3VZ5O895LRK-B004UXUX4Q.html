<meta name="summary" content="Ultimately Where We All Are Now"></head><body><p>I looked at some of the other Amazon reviews and noticed some viewers found this film boring.  I am not one of them. The film is about a middle aged man who is in crisis because he has life altering decisions and events to face.  This character is played by George Clooney.  Some people when faced with immense land holdings in one of the richest real estate markets on earth, Hawaii, would be wastrels.  Not him.  He is an attorney who supports himself even though he has final power in a trust that involes huge land holdings which came from the original family.  Although these descendants all look white now, way back on his maternal end, there was a full Hawiaan great grandmother who was the heiress,<br /><br />What he is facing is that all of his relatives want to sell the land and he has that power under the trust.  They do not. Also, his wife was in a boating accident, ended up in a coma and now lays dying in a vegatative state.  She has signed a living will which everyone is honoring. He has two daughters who also must be brought into the picture.  They think she's going to recover.<br /><br />In the midst of all of the above, his older daughter tells him his wife was having an affair.  He decides to find the guy and tell him what has happened.  The guy is a real estate agent who stands to make a fortune if the land deal goes through,<br /><br />None of this is played at a melodramatic level.  It unfolds as it would likely unfold in real life, mostly very quietly.  Clooney does a wonderful job.  This is where we all live at some point, where there are decisions and events that will follow us until our days wind down.<br /><br />There is a small role of the dying wife's father which is really fantastic.  Everyone has experienced this kind of person.  Given the bad news of his daughter's coming death, his sole reaction from there to the end is to lash out and blame everyone.else in the family.  He even makes the accident their faults although the wife was with someone else who was driving the boat at the time of her accident. He never lets up, just finds new ways to continue the attack on others as the day of death moves closer.<br /><br />This film has Oscar written all over it and I expect it to do very well at the Oscars.  It already won the Golden Globe for best drama.</p></body></html>

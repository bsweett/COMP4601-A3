Rambo is living in Northern Thailand and transports people in his boat. Michael Burnett, a  missionary asks Rambo if he will take him and his associates up the Salween river to help injured people in Burma. Rambo tries to tell them is a very bad idea, but Sarah Miller really tries to get him to, so Rambo does it. After they arrive and help people, some Burmese army people come and try to kill them all, showing a bloody carnage! When Rambo finds out, Rambo and some soldiers return to Burma to kill the bad guys and save the innocent! So, if you love action, bloody violence, and the Rambo series, you'll definitely enjoy RAMBO!!!</p></body></html>

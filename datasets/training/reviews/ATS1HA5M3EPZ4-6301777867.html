Glory is the true story of how the Black Americans in the 54th Regimen fought for a country that didn't appreciate them.  Not enough can be said about this movie.  The story is solid, the performances by the actors is excellent.  Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington and several other black actors give fantastic performances as black men, but all of them very different black men.  An escaped slave, a grave digger, and an educated free black man (from the time when blacks were free in Boston).  Broderick gives one of his most unique performances to date, setting aside the image of Ferris Bueller to play a young Colonel who trains and prepares the men for combat.  His performance is accurate, playing a young but smart and wise Commanding officer who genuinely believes his men are equal soldiers to any other regimen.  The movie is powerful, beautiful, frightening and thought provoking.  The men who died in this story died for real, and for almost nothing.  Their story should be told to everyone, so they can realize that more then just the heroes who wrote history existed.  Highly recommended, especially the Special Edition DVD.  There are a lot of extras and interviews.</p></body></html>

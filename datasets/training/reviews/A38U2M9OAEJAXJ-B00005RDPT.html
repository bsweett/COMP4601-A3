<meta name="summary" content="An "Ocean" Worth Diving Into."></head><body><p>After hitting Oscar gold with both "Traffic" and "Erin Brokovitch," director Stephen Soderbergh became a bankable Hollywood filmmaker. His remake of the 1960s original, "Ocean's 11" is a hugely entertaining hesit flick that soars on the strength of its all-star cast. George Clooney stars as Daniel Ocean, who, upon release from prison, teams up with his sidekick played by Brad Pitt to orchestrate a robbery at Vegas's top three casinos, all of which are managed by their owner (Andy Garcia). Meanwhile, Ocean is trying to patch things up with his ex-wife (Julia Roberts) who is now with the owner of the very casinos he plans to rob. So, is the robbery a success or a bust? I won't spoil it for you, but the film, while lacking the deph and gravity of "Traffic," is fun to watch. Other notable players are the always-funny Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Matt Damon, Scott Caan (son of James), and Casey Affleck. I hesitated to give the DVD a 5 star rating only because it skimps on the extras. Aside from the 2 commentaries, all we get is a 15-minute fluffy documentary and a handful of trailers. Nevertheless, the movie's a real treat and gets the green light from me.</p></body></html>

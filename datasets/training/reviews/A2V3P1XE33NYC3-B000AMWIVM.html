Every other day brought new photos, new links to trailers, new behind the scenes stories, and new conjectures all pointing to the incredible potential of this movie. Those insiders lucky enough to view the film before its general release spoke in reverent tones about the carnage we all would soon see with "Saw." They furthermore whispered words like "giallo" and "Argento" to describe the stylistic aspects of the movie. Needless to say I wanted to see this picture in the worst way after reading such high praise: I love films larded with gory carnage, love gialli, and think Dario Argento is one of the great horror masters of the modern age. Sadly, seeing "Saw" in the theater would not become a reality for me. In a tradeoff with my girlfriend that I will rue until the day I die, I agreed to attend a screening of the pedestrian "The Forgotten" instead of "Saw." I just got my revenge, however, by forcing her to watch the DVD edition of a film that I consider one of the best new horror films to come down the pike in quite some time.<br /><br />"Saw" begins by introducing us to two characters who will come to dominate most of the film's screen time: Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes). The two men awake to find themselves chained to pipes in a phenomenally grungy bathroom with little knowledge of how they got there or why they are there. Then they start discovering clues: a corpse clutching a tape recorder and pistol lies in a pool of blood in the center of the room, envelopes containing cassette tapes lie in their pockets, hacksaws soon turn up, and a camera watches them from behind a two way mirror. It's obvious someone with a sick sense of humor placed these guys in this room with a purpose in mind, and that purpose gradually comes to the fore with horrific implications. Dr. Gordon suddenly recalls a series of incidents a few months before involving a serial killer named Jigsaw, a killer whose victims perish in extraordinarily graphic ways. It turns out that this murderer isn't an average stalk and slash psychopath, however, but a cunning sadist who thinks his mission is to teach others the value of life. He does so by placing them in traps that require the subject to overcome their flaws in order to escape. Adam and Gordon are definitely caught up in Jigsaw's latest shenanigans.<br /><br />Most of what we learn in "Saw" comes from flashbacks from Adam and Gordon. We learn that a Detective Tapp (Danny Glover) and his fellow investigators on the force tried to pin the crimes on Dr. Gordon when they linked a piece of evidence to the good doctor. We also discover that Gordon has a lot of family problems with his daughter and wife. Heck, it isn't too long before we realize that nearly every major character--Tapp, Adam, Gordon, and a couple of others--possesses some secret that hints at the possibility that any of these guys could be Jigsaw. And we learn more about Jigsaw, his strange philosophy, his haunts, and his stomach churning props. This killer locked one of his victims, Amanda (Shawnee Smith), in a helmet that could tear her head apart and demanded she look for the key in the most unusual of places. He's a warped, warped individual, but he's also a guy who keeps his word. If his victim escapes from his scheme they are free to reenter society, hopefully with a better outlook on the importance of life. "He helped me," claims Amanda, and it's disturbing to realize you understand exactly what she means.<br /><br />Jigsaw's philosophy is one of only a large number of massively disturbing elements in "Saw," but it's one of the more interesting ones. People say his stance on life mirrors the film "Seven," and perhaps that is so. I saw a greater similarity between Jigsaw's tortures and the scene in "Fight Club" where Tyler Durden uses the threat of death to force a young convenience store clerk to follow his dream of becoming a veterinarian instead of wallowing in apathy. The idea is to get people to wake up and start appreciating each and every day. If it takes a barbed wire trap or a bear trap helmet to bring the sheep to their senses, so be it. "Saw" offers us more than mere mental gymnastics, fortunately, including Cary Elwes hamming it up as the coolly aloof Gordon, a very creepy puppet used to great effect, and a scene with a flashbulb taken right out of the original "Texas Chain Saw Massacre." In fact, "Saw" rips off a lot of stuff from other classic horror films, but it does so in way that didn't bother me. Frankly, I like to see a movie paying homage once in awhile. What did surprise me was the gore, or lack thereof. This is the unrated cut? Where's the sauce? There are a few nasty surprises but "Saw" keeps most of the grue safely out of camera range. Pity.<br /><br />Extras on the widescreen edition disc disappoint. I kicked back before starting the behind the scenes feature, figuring that the whole thing would take twenty or thirty minutes to play out. It took TWO AND A HALF MINUTES! Then there's a music video and a short documentary about making the music video. The poster gallery and trailers section don't break new ground, nor does the commentary track from director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell. Who wants to bet a double dip special edition DVD will arrive in stores soon? Any takers? Nevertheless, "Saw" is definitely worth a watch; it's a fine film that blows away most of the mainstream horror coming out today.</p></body></html>

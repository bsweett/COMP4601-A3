<meta name="summary" content="SAD BUT TRUE!!"></head><body><p>This movie is one of the strangest, but yet good cause it deals with history.<br />It shows how a dictatorship gives a single person way to much power.<br />It also shows me that it doesn't matter the color of your skin, we're all<br />human and with that kind of power we all would let it go to our head.<br />I would say this is one of the best movies I've seen whitaker in.<br />It's to bad so many people died under the rule of this man.<br />In my opinion if you like historic movies this is a must see.<br />I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly Good!"></head><body><p>Freddy vs. Jason (as in Nightmare on Elm Street Part VIII and Friday the 13th Part XI, all in one) sheds light on a pair of familiar, though not too friendly, faces: that of Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees.  Freddy, who has successfully been forgotten by the community he has been terrorizing, uses Jason as a means by which to implicate himself in a series of gruesome murders, hence allowing him to return in people's fears and subsequently their dreams.<br /><br />Things become a little complicated when Jason becomes a tad overzealous and Freddy gets a little bit jealous ...<br /><br />The plot, the setting, the acting, and the dialogues are all very good.<br /><br />Monica Keena is delightful as Lori Campbell and a little "exposure" would have been pretty nice...<br /><br />In a nutshell, Freddy vs. Jason is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will provide for an evening's entertainment, as long as you're in that kind of a mood.</p></body></html>

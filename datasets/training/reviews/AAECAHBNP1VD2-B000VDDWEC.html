<meta name="summary" content="But it's NOT a Zombie flick!"></head><body><p>Unbless I missed something really vital when I saw this, the crazies in this aren't zombies but infected victims. Zombies are already dead; these folks weren't(and every director doing a zombielike film has stolen the super-speed effect since). An important distinction when you're referring to a film by the wrong genre.<br />That being said, while no cinematic classic, the movie is entertaining, well-photographed, and well-cast. Personally, a little more overall character development, more physical interaction between the 2 main characters and, yes, a bit more gore (it's a horror/slasher film, no?)would've been nice. Certain areas seemed way too jumpy. There's also an interesting subtle nod to George Romero with one of the "characters." The extras are very well-organized and pretty interesting. All told, worth renting at least, owning if you can get it cheap.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Copy of a Copy of a Copy of a Copy."></head><body><p>Movies usually don't turn out better than the books they are based upon.  Movie sequels, unless part of a trilogy, rarely turn out better than the original movies. However, movie sequels based upon book sequels usually turn out better (see THE LOST WORLD for example). BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON isn't one of those cases. In fact, it's the exact oppositte. This movie is an example of what happens when you make a copy of a copy a couple of times over. The original film adaptation of BRIDGET JONES was a joy to watch and in many ways improved upon the original novel.  However, the book sequel was a disappointment and this movie sequel is a pure disaster. The film is one of the worst movies I have seen in a theatre in a long time and if it wasn't for the prescence of Colin Firth, it wouldn't be worth watching ever.<br /><br />The first film stayed fairly close to the novel. This movie doesn't. That's not necessarily bad, especially seeing that the novel's sequel is inferior to the original writing as well. However, the way the filmmakers chose to veer away from the novel's plot is just so wrong. From the commuted stay and sentence in Thailand with very little background information to the turning of Bridget's nemesis Rebecca into a lesbian out to seduce her and not Mark Darcy to the complete disappearance of certain important events, situations, and people (e.g. naked housekeeper's son, the party at the summer house, Wellington) the book rarely uses the original text as an outline. Like I mentioned before, that's not necessarily bad, but instead of straying away from the text to improve upon it, the book swerves completely away.<br /><br />Then of course there are all the extras that were added. Supposedly to make the script more interesting:  Bridget trying to buy a pregnancy test somewhere in, Austria I guess. Or how about the fistfight between Colin Firth and Hugh Grant--the only reason that scene is even in the movie is so the directors could have some excuse to have Colin Firth fall in a fountain of water again and get soaking wet so that the ladies of England would lick their lips. Scenes like these add nothing to the story whatsoever. Not only that, they aren't even funny; not in a typical American-type ha-ha-funny, not in the usual droll British guffaw type funny. The only people who would get a serious laugh out of those scenes are people who aren't going to be watching the movie (the REAL WORLD/MTV crowed will be watching things like AMERICAN PIE, not BRIDGET JONES) to begin with. So why even bother to putt them in as filler?<br /><br />Besides all that, there's also the actors' enthusiasm.  In the first movie, everyone seemed liked the must have really had a good time making the movie. In THE EDGE OF REASON, everyone but Colin Firth seems like they are just there to pick up a paycheck. Renee Zellweger is a very talented actress who is one of my favorites and one an Oscar nod for her first performance. In this movie, Zellweger appears as though all the weight gaining/loosing/gaining and other physical demands she has placed upon herself have gotten to her. Bridget no longer seems perky and adorable, but down and almost pathetic.  Colin Firth does the best job out of all the actors, but even he at times seems like he's just walking through the paces following the tape on the floor. It just goes to show, if you're going to copy a copy of a copy of a copy, change it up a little bit and make it more original. Originality can be a lifesaver because Colin Firth isn't always going to be around.</p></body></html>

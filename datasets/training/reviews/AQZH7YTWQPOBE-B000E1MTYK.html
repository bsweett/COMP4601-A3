<meta name="summary" content="A good Harry Potter film"></head><body><p>I had some mixed feelings about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6EK2Y">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a>. Prof. Moody is probably the funniest of the Dark Arts professors in the series. Also, we see the kids grow up into teenagers. As cinematography, it's probably the best done movie of the Harry Potter series. The special effects (from dragons to Voldemort's minions) are great. The action is entertaining and captures some of the wonder of the world of wizards - more so than any of the other films thus far.<br /><br />That said, I feel like parts of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6EK2Y">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a> are just downright childish or silly. The whole ball and dating scenes made the film more like a high-school drama rather than fantasy - a "Wizards 90210." Also, the international wizards teams are boring stereotypes of the French and Bulgarians, rather than a more interesting group of characters. I understand the filmmakers had to make do with the material in the books. Still, if I had directed the films, I would have cut the ballroom scene out and included something more relevant to the plot.</p></body></html>

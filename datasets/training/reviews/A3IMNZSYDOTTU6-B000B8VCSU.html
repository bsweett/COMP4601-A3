<meta name="summary" content="A Phenomenal Film With Em's Impressive Debut..."></head><body><p>Rapper Eminem is one of the biggest names in rap...period. He's sold over 40 million albums worldwide and has garnered Grammys and other awards over his near-decade career. With so much success, it was only a matter of time before a movie would become a reality, and 8 MILE makes a big case for Eminem's acting career. Boasting impressive settings, a really good cast, and gritty drama, this movie is fantastic from front to back.<br /><br />We follow the story of Jimmy Smith (aka B Rabbit) who can flow like any rapper can, but the trouble is he is wicked shy of the crowd at the "shelter" where the rap battles happen. His friends Chedda Bob, Future (Mekhi Pfeiffer, who makes a strong presence here), and his other cohorts are his friends. He lives in a trailer with his alcoholic mother (played by Kim Basinger, who is vulnerable here), and his little sister. Eminem works at the Detroit Stamping company, where the pay ain't great but the work is hard, and there is some prejudice. Jimmy doesn't exactly have the best life, but he's trying to do the best that he can. His mother's abusive boyfriend, Greg, isn't exactly helping matters either...he doesn't really like Jimmy and takes every opportunity to put him down. Eminem starts to really take his rapping future seriously, though, and when he meets a new girl (Brittany Murphy), things begin to change a bit. But pressures ride as Leaders of the Free World claim to have the best raps, and after an altercation with one of the members, Eminem gets the crap kicked out of him. But this only makes him stronger, and he intends to beat the LOTFW at the rap battles. His mother strikes it big at bingo and things really start looking better. The night of the battle, Eminem can't choke like he did the first time at the beginning of the movie, so now he's gotta show that he is the man when it comes to stepping up to the mic. His relationship with his boss at work gets much better too, so work is piling up. I don't want to give away what happens at the rap battle, but I'm sure you can guess what happens. Even the ending of the movie is really strong, with "Lose Yourself" playing in the background as Eminem walks off into the alley, having a newly restored confidence as he strolls back to work.<br /><br />The movie benefits greatly from Eminem's convincing performance. He's not just cashing the check here, he really can act. He mixes some good emotions and strong acting with impressive raps and this was bound to happen. He's good at what he does...and he's good here. The rest of the cast is good, too, with Brittany Murphy, Mekhi Pfeiffer and Kim Basinger all taking good turns honing their acting chops. Of course the rap bouts are the talk of the town, and you should find plenty to enjoy in these moments. But the quiet, anguished moments are just as strong, and the slum-like sets of Detroit ring loud and clear in this picture. All of it makes a big difference in the power and the lesson of the movie.<br /><br />So Eminem fans, fear not. Eminem does just fine in his big film debut here. You'll find a lot to appreciate here, with some laughs, some tear-y moments, and some gritty street drama. While many never thought Eminem could carry his own as an actor, 8 MILE presents a strong case for his possible future in this business. This is one tough film you don't want to miss.</p></body></html>

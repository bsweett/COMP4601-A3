Bigotry is an ever-growing boorishness in our society and young Americans are easily induced into believing that one sex or one race is better than the other. It is scary to think that one man alone can be responsible for such wide-spread hatred, but this movie only proves that you need but a few people of similar thinking to spread the word and build your biased militia. The story is told through the eyes of Derek Vinyard's younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong), an impressionable adolescent who idolizes his brother's power of persuasion and blindly consigns to his discriminatory views. <p>Derek (Edward Norton) has reasonable predisposed opinions of African-Americans: his firefighting father was murdered by one of them while sousing a blaze in an impoverished quarter of Venice Beach, California. From the immediate point of this personal tragedy, his vocation is to spread the belief that foreigners and ethnics are given more rights than hard-working, white Protestants and the solution is now in the hands of the victims: themselves. Thus under the headship of well-known white supremacist Cameron Alexander, Derek builds his legion of racist devotees, deftly christening his growing gang of disillusioned teens the &quot;D.O.C.&quot;. The consequences of these beliefs take a powerful impact on his family when he guns down two Crips trying to steal his truck and is incarcerated for three years. During this time, his fledgling organization continues cultivating under the supervision of Cameron whilst Danny is swallowed into the chaos and adheres to Derek's corrupt ideals.  <p>Through his junket in a maximum-security prison, his fellow inmate in the laundry happens to be a young black man interned for a false charge of assault. He breaks down the towering wall of stereotypes that surround his race, making Derek realize his beliefs were largely askew and that he had dissapatedly influenced many innocent people, more importantly his brother. As soon as he is paroled, he is on a mission to sway Danny from the neo-Nazi crew that he himself formulated and to unlearn the harmful ethics he so vigorously preached. This proves to be a difficult task as Danny has been completely conditioned by the fascist agenda of the D.O.C., posing a grueling solution: Derek must confront Cameron and confess to Danny the agonizing incident that induced his miraculous epiphany behind bars.<p>Edward Furlong is excellent here, showing there is a deeper acting power lurking in him than such flops as &quot;Brainscan&quot;, &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; and &quot;Pet Sematary II&quot;. He plays his character with impressive range and doesn't inflate Danny's Nazi disposition to a ridiculous degree and balances his emotional outbursts to an acceptable median. Beverly D'Angelo and newcomer Jennifer Lien turn in top-notch performances as Derek's distraught mother Doris and his educated, fiercely liberal sibling Davina. I have to say I was surprised to see Ethan Suplee as Derek's narrow-minded companion Seth after the bawling dimwit he played in Kevin Smith's critical flop &quot;Mallrats&quot;. Some other famous faces included Stacy Keach as the indomitable Cameron Alexander, Avery Brooks as the laissez-faire counselor Bob Sweeney, and the former Mr. Streisand Eliot Gould as the Jewish boyfriend Murray. Who I was not surprised to see playing the brainwashed girlfriend Stacey is Fairuza Balk, a veteran of such bizarre films as &quot;Return To Oz&quot;, &quot;The Island Of Dr. Moreau&quot; and &quot;The Craft&quot;. She definetely fits the character description with her willingness to buzz her raven locks and wear unattractive appliques to the most noticeable parts of her face. She's one in a million, and I have to say she was wonderful.<p>Who really turns this film and its audience upside down is Edward Norton. A colossal performance anchoring this recycled theme, Edward brings the stereotypical skinhead to life with horrifying realism, pushing the limits with Derek's loutish temperament and blissful ignorance. He spews the Nazi-esque propaganda with nary a flaw or pause, his powerful preaching frightening convincing at times. I found myself nodding my head in agreement in the scene where he complained about &quot;border jumpers&quot; vying for American jobs and the citizens of our country receiving inadequate support in their growing poverty because of invading foreigners. I thought how incredible it was that I had been swayed as easily as his audience of teenagers on these issues, but not on others (believing I am supreme because I'm a Catholic Caucasian). This is a sign of an amazing writer, one who harbors an autocratic power that is channeled through this mesmerizing and credible character.<p>Tony Kaye's artistic brilliance lent this film an emotive and metaphorical leg, curbing the abhorrent pretense with ingenious merit and poetic essence. The black and white segments are purposely applied to convey the mindset of its protaganist. The film finishes with the full-color portions of the beach, suggesting to the audience that everyone (characters and viewers) is illuminated as a result. Many complained that this artsy approach hampered the grisly subject matter, but I think it balanced a delicate scale of mindless violence by reintroducing humanity with our fragile existences. Overall, &quot;American History X&quot; shows us that violence is an infinite circle that traverses far and wide but always comes back to haunt us.</p></body></html>

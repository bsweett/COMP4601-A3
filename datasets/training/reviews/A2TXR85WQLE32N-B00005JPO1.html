Harrison Ford reprises his role as Professor Henry "Indiana" Jones.  Karen Allen returns as the Miriam Ravenwood of "Raiders of the Lost Ark."  Shia LeBeouf debuts in the series as an angry young man who seeks out Indiana Jones' help in the case of a missing professor (a shaggy John Hurt in a nicely demented turn).<br /><br />The movie opens in the Nevada desert of 1957.  A group of Russian KGB thugs disguised as U.S. Army soldiers breaks into a warehouse at a secret base.  Their leader, a female KGB Colonel with paranormal abilities (played with icy disdain by Cate Blanchett) is in search of a crate containing a mysterious item.  To help locate the item, she has kidnapped Indiana Jones, who makes a perhaps suitably semi-dramatic entrance.<br /><br />At gunpoint, Indy is forced to help the Russians find the item, a crystal skull, before staging a dramatic escape through what looks like a museum of Cold War artifacts.  Indy will improbably survive an atomic test during his getaway.<br /><br />After a brief narrative bow at Cold War paranoia and the missing characters from the last Indiana Jones movie, Indy links up with Shia Lebeouf's Mutt, an angry young greaser on a motorcycle who needs Indy's help to find his kidnapped mother and a Professor Oxley, an old friend of Professor Jones.  Professor Oxley had apparently discovered a long-lost, semi-legendary City of Gold in the Amazon jungles, a city holding a secet the Russians want for themselves.  Mutt carries a letter from Oxley, written in code in a dead language that only Indiana can make sense of.  The two are off to Peru in an improbable partnership, just steps ahead of the Russian KGB.<br /><br />The ensuing treasure hunt pays homage to all the plot devices of previous Indian Jones movies, with creepy tombs, nasty bad guys, archeological puzzles, and several breathless chase scenes.  Along the way, Indiana will be reunited with an old flame and one old friend and survive betrayal by another. The climax of the movie is as thrilling as an overload of CGI can make it.<br /><br />The good news for fans of Indiana Jones is that Harrison Ford is entirely credible as the older and creakier but still sarcastic and savy adventurer.  Bringing back Miriam Ravenwood provides an intriguing love angle, although Karen Allen isn't given a lot to do.  Shia Lebeouf picks up a lot of the action chores for Indy, and there is just the slightest suggestion at movie's end that he might pick up the franchise.  The bad news may be that the franchise is now competing with younger and fresher versions of itself such as "National Treasure."  Less attention is given to character and story development and rather more to over-the-top special effects.  Fans of Indiana Jones will appreciate the movie and the ending; newcomers may wonder what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is highly recommended as good entertainment for fans of the Indiana Jones franchise.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable Action Flick - Recommended"></head><body><p>"Shooter" is a very watchable action movie with fairly good acting and special effects to keep interest up through the few slower parts.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: The story follows John Lee Swagger (great name for this character), a retired Marine Sniper, that is asked to do one more seemingly beneficial job for the government. Obviously, things do not go as planned and he is soon the subject of a nation wide manhunt and Swagger needs to use his Marine Corp Sniper training to stay alive. There are quite a few plot holes and it is hard to believe that the experienced and powerful forces at work in the shadows could be so good at somethings and so very incompetent at other related activities, but that is where some suspension of disbelief is required.<br /><br />It would be easy to get drawn into harping on the few preachy parts and political cynicism that crept in from the time this movie was made (released in 1997), but I choose to just enjoy it as an action movie.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></body></html>

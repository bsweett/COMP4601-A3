<meta name="summary" content="Too Borrowed"></head><body><p>Pinch me if you haven't seen most of these scripts before:<br />(1.) Military has secret alien project.<br />(2.) Alien escapes.<br />(3.) From, usually a military escort like a convoy, or train, or ship.<br />(4.) Alien looks like any combination of the following (in this case - all): Predator, E.T., Alien.<br />(5.) Poor alien is misunderstood. Needs better make-up or a Victoria's Secret casting resum&eacute;.<br />(6.) The military (or any enforcement agency) is always portrayed as dumb-assess.<br />(7.) Scientists look the same today as they did in the '40s, '50s ... Although I know an athletic female astrophysics student at Yale who's hot. Come on, casting director evolve into the 21st century.<br />(8.) Usually one notable CGI scene which in this case is the train wreck.<br />(9.) As usual the teens need to show the adults what dumb ... they are and save the world.<br />(10.) Alien is anatomically and biophysically impossible most likely because the writers, directors and producers have zero interest in taking advantage of an educational opportunity. Alien spaceship violates not only every conceivable physical law but is illogical as well. If it's familiar it sells! Money, money, money!<br />(11.) Everybody lives happily ever after. Alien gets her modeling contract.</p></body></html>

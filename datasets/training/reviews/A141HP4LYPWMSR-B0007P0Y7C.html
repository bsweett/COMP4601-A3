Jennifer Garner is terrific as Elektra, a ninja assassin turned protector of a single father (Goran Visnijic) and his daughter (Kristen Prout), a martial arts prodigy known as "the Treasure".<br /><br />'Elektra' boasts a strong storyline, excellent cast and enough martial arts, mysticism and occultic themes to keep most fans of this genre of film satisfied.<br /><br />Also starring Terence Stamp and Cary Hiroyuki Taqawa.</p></body></html>

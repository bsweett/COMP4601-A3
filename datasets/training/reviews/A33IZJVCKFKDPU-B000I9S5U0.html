But it also goes a little deeper.  This story takes place in 1930, and for all you history majors, thats during the great depression.  Jim Braddock (Crowe) was the top fighter during the late 1920s.  Then the depression happened, age and injuries that he couldn't afford to repair started to take their toll, and suddenly Jim Braddock is an average man that goes to the docks everyday looking for some work.  He is having a really tough time trying to support his family, until he gets a lucky break.  He gets a chance at another fight because someone dropped out.  What does he do in this fight?  He whoops up on his opponent and gets back into the boxing circle.  After continuing wins, he gets a shot at the champ, Max Baer.  Baer is the most dominant boxer of the time.  He actually killed two men in the ring. YIKES!!  None the less, Braddock fights him in the championship and ....<br /><br />This movie is almost like a sure-fire can't miss.  It has Ron Howard directing.  We all know what he is capable of doing and man, does he do it good here.  He creates a great image a depression era.  The lighting is very dim, there are not very many colors and even down to not making Russell Crowe too big, that way he looks more like a 1930s era boxer, Ron Howard sure knows what he is doing as a director.  Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger star in this film.  I'm pretty sure that both will recieve Oscar nominations for their roles in this flick. And stealing the show from both actors is Paul Giamatti (who is the most under-rated actor in the business) doing the supporting role as Braddock's trainer Joe Gould.  He provides the comic relief in a film that definitely needs a little.  Theres a really good storyline of survival during the depression and its one of those feel good movies that makes you proud to be an American.<br /><br />If my first statement wasen't enough to hint at my recommendation, here it is again.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!  The first 45 minutes of this movie move a little slow but hang in there, the ending is worth the wait.  I guess you can say that this movie is a knockout.</p></body></html>

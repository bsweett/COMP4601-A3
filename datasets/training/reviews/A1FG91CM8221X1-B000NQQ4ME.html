Whatever you may think of Gibson as a man, he shows himself in "Apocalypto" to be an extraordinarily daring, extraordinarily gifted writer-director.<br /><br />"Apocalypto" is as grand, expansive and panoramic as anything Cecil B. DeMille ever attempted, meticulously recreating the Mayan culture and civilization of the 16th century at the exact moment before the Spaniards arrived. But in its narrative sweep, intensity, realism, and sense of tragedy, "Apocalypto" leaves DeMille in the dust. There is nothing stilted about "Apocalypto;" you feel you are really there, living the anguish of Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), a jungle hunter and warrior, as he tries to flee from a cruel Mayan death squad and reunite with his pregnant wife and small son.<br /><br />This being a Mel Gibson film, be warned that the level of violence in "Apocalypto" is very high, and Jaguar Paw comes in for a LOT of punishment. Nevertheless, once you have seen "Apocalypto," you will never forget it. It deserves to be ranked among the classic cinematic epics.</p></body></html>

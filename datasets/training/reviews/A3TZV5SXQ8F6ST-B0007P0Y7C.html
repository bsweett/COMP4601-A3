Elektra (Garner) is a hired assassin who refuses to go forward with an assigned hit, which doesn't sit well with an evil organization.<br /><br />The shadows that twists and turns the soul of Elektra are not heavily delved into, as the focus is on action. Garner has a striking presence, but is underutilized due to the character never fully stepping away from the comics.<br /><br />The bonus material is outstanding, with a documentary on the character - which includes an interview with Frank Miller - and an in-depth "making of" documentary and film commentary by director Rob Bowman and editor Kevin Stitt.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, there was potential missed to turn Elektra into a solid movie franchise.</p></body></html>

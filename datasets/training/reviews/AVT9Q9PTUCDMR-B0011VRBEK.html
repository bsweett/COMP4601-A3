<meta name="summary" content="ridiculous but watchable"></head><body><p>The story is ridiculous and has so many holes in it, I'm shocked at the press reviews lauding it so much. Where the movie works for me is the layers that are revealed as to why this guy was imprisoned in hotel room (why a hotel room...your guess is as good as mine) for 15 years and why he's never told why he's being imprisoned. Yet this whole psychological experiment is really one of revenge from something tragic that happened back in his high school days.<br /><br />Weirdly loopy logic throughout. Incredibly dark sets. Gratuitous nudity. Hilarious English dubbing. It works on a B movie level but to think this is great "art" is taking it a bit far. It's basically a typical story found in Japanese manga that J-salarymen get off on (high school sex and suicide) redone in a South Korean setting.<br /><br />The extras are dull as dishwater usual--audio commentary track, director interview, deleted scenes.<br /><br />A rental at best.</p></body></html>

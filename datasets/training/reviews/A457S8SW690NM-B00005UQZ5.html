<meta name="summary" content="An excellent thriller"></head><body><p>The Fugitive is one thriller that you can't go wrong with. First of all, most of the good thrillers that I have seen are rated R, while on the other hand, this is rated PG-13. That is always nice to have some great thrillers rated PG-13. So, more people can see them. Anyway, the movie has great action, great suspense, great acting and an amazing escape from the prison transport vehicule. This is also one movie that never gets old. I have seen it probably 7 or 8 times and it's always so awesome.<br /><br />The movie is about a surgeon wrongly accused of murdering his wife. This surgeon escapes from the prison transport vehicule and sets forth to find the real people that killed his wife. But, the cops are everywhere after him. The movie has a great conclusion, nonstop suspense and is a thriller that is necessary in every collection.<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, I find this movie to be Harrison Ford's best movie and not Indiana Jones.</p></body></html>

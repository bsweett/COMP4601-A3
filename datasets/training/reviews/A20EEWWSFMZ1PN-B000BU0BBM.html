<meta name="summary" content="And they all lived happily ever after"></head><body><p>Many of you grew up in the sugar coated version of their tails. Some have read the real ones and recoiled. Well we finally get the real skinny; this fine true to life movie is more of a documentary explaining the real Brothers Grimm.<br /><br />In French occupied Germany the brothers Jake and Will Grimm (Heath Ledger and Matt Damon) are out to make a fast buck. And they do to, until they are found out by the French general Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce who played Juan Per&oacute;n in "Evita" [1996]). Now force to work for the French or perish they must confront what appears to be a better organized group of hucksters, or just maybe the real thing.<br /><br />Will they accomplish their mission and maybe find a new respect for each other?  Or will they fail to save a damsel in distress. Can we hold up through all this peril?<br /><br />Anyway this is an enjoyable film even if a bit too campy. And they all lived happily ever after. Well maybe not.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393058484">The Annotated Brothers Grimm</a></p></body></html>

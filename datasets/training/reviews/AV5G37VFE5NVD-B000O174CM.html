It may be forgotten, it may remembered, but what's important is that while watching it, the audience is transfixed, uplifted, and compelled to get up and sing.  It has great music, a great cast, and a great screenplay to tie it all together.  The moral of the story, if there is one, isn't really clear, but the plot, based on the tale of Diana Ross & The Supremes, revolves around three young women who become R&B superstars in the 1960s, and how their lives fall apart as their stardom increases.  If the film does have a problem, it's because it uses the same formula used by every other "motown bio drama" ever made: nobodys have a shot at stardom, they work for stardom, they become superstars, they fall into drugs and depression, they redeem themselves and accept the end of their careers.  Fortunately the rest of the film is grand enough that the formulativeness is hardly noticeable.<br /><br />The three young women are portrayed by Beyonce Knowles, AMERICAN IDOL finalist Jennifer Hudson, and Anika Noni Rose; by the film's end, a fourth girl, Sharon Leal, has joined.  Jamie Foxx plays the slimy manager, and Danny Glover plays the kindhearted manager.  Keith Robinson plays Hudson's brother and the girls' songwriter, and Eddie Murphy plays the rambunctious James "Thunder" Early.  The entire cast is excellent, but standouts are Hudson, who is a surprisingly talented actor, and Murphy, who finally receives a chance to show off some dramatic acting and succeeds in doing so.  Foxx is also great as his most despicable character ever.<br /><br />Bill Condon, who did a marvelous job with 2002's hit CHICAGO, does some great work here, utilizing numerous camera angles to create a sort of swirling, uplifting feeling.  The editing is seamless, and the production design is shiny and fresh.  It's the music that's really wonderful, though - sweet, hearty, warm, soaring, and a variety of other colorful, delectable adjectives.  With audiences' recently-renewed interest in musicals, I'm surprised that an R&B musical hasn't been done earlier.<br /><br />There's not a lot to be said about DREAMGIRLS - there's nothing especially original or bold about it.  But it's good, well-made, high-spirited fun, and if you're looking for a way to kill 2 hours, you can't do much better.  The cast is great, the music is great, the film is great, and even if no one remembers it ten years from now, the sheer enjoyment the audience gets from the experience is all that matters.</p></body></html>

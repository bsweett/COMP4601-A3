<meta name="summary" content="IF ONLY IT HAD SLOW-MOTION IT WOULD BE PERFECT!!!!!!!!"></head><body><p>Everything in this movie was perfect for a WILD action film!! But WHERE THE SLOW-MO????!!!!!<br /><br />The movie also had a few defects, but they are not THAT important! Here they are:<br /><br />* The fisrt action scene is kind of boring when you see the movie for the second time to foward. (Im talking about the dark action scene that took soo long before the action)!<br /><br />* No slow-motion as I said.<br /><br />* The final fight was original but stupid and short.<br /><br />* The evil boss look's SOOO LAME!!!!<br /><br />* All the action scenes were kind of short but COOOOL!!!!!!<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, The movie is AWESOME!!!!! It just that it could be a LOT better!<br /><br />Adios!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock at his best!"></head><body><p>I first saw this movie last summer at a friends house, and I immediatly  went out and bought the movie! It is one of the best movies that I have  ever seen. <p>It is about a woman named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who is  on the run with some stolen money. She drives off, leaving her job and her  home. She ends up at the Bates Motel, which is ran by a creepy manager  named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Norman notices that she is wet and  cold since it was raining outside, and offers to make her a sandwich and  get her something warm to drink. He goes into his house to get the food,  and Marion overhears Norman yelling at someone, who turns out to be his  mother. Marion starts to worry, and apologizes to Norman that she got him  into trouble. He tells Marion that his mother is not quite herself. Marion  eats her food, and talks to Norman, and then she goes into her cabin to  take a shower. Someone comes into the shower and stabs her to death. Norman  suspects that it was his mother, and cleans up the mess, and drives  Marion's car into a lake. Anyways, a detective and Marion's sister and  boyfriend end up investigating the scene....and thats all that I am saying!  Rent this movie! It is great, and I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

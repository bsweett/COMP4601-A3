Alike another horror concept."></head><body><p>Ridley Scott's American Gangster about real life bad guy and drug lord, Frank Lucas, in American Gangster receives two Oscar noms.  Forrest Whitaker won an Oscar for his portrayal of Ugandan dictator, Idi Amin.  Who says you can't do a biopic film of a fictional character?  Rob Zombie does just that in this biography, not remake, of horror icon Michael Myers.  I would also guess that more Americans have probably heard of the fictional, Michael Myers, than Amin, or Lucas.<br /><br />Zombie's Halloween goes into detail of Michael as a child, while there is still something of a child left, and the hell on earth that exists in many households.  Michael Myers will become the manifestation of evil in society.  Halloween was reminiscent of David Cronenberg's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009PY2T">The Brood</a> and how the mother's anger physically manifested itself as she spawned deformed children to seek out what angered her.  Unlike the mother in The Brood Michael doesn't lash out at society but becomes the evil in society and eventually will no longer be human.  True evil cannot be stopped with a gun or a knife and neither can Michael Myers.<br /><br />My point is Zombie's film can be looked at as poetic and a message for non violence (you think I'm crazy).  Michael Myers is a metaphor for the evil in our society, specifically the evil that hides in the suburbs behind closed doors.  Myers uses a mask to hide this evil as suburbs could mask this with white picket fence as a happy front. If you can't use violence to stop this evil as we do in our society then you have to go to the roots, the family and family values.  Similarly the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143038257">Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Promote Peace . . . One School at a Time</a> which uses education to fight terror where it starts and not bombs.<br /><br />There are two moments in the film where, Michael Myers, the boy fights that evil.  The first, after Michael has murdered his family and is locked away in an institution he has an emotional breakdown with Dr. Loomis at Christmas time.  Michael for an instant realizes the situation and is terrified this reminded me of Regan in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/079073804X">The Exorcist (25th Anniversary Special Edition)</a> as the demon left her.  Flash to the next scene and Michael is gone and the evil has taken him.  The second moment after Michael has kidnapped Laurie he once again becomes human for a  moment, drops his knife, and shows his face to his sister, once Laurie stabs him and he puts the mask back on Michael is now dead and there is only evil.<br /><br />Zombie has a stellar cast of horror veterans that there are too many to list.  Zombie does not use this as a gimmick or to wink at horror fans the film is taken seriously from beginning to end and their are solid performances all around.  Rob Zombie seems to get better with each film as does his wife Sheri Moon Zombie who gave a solid performance as Michael's mother.  The photograph that is shown at the end was very effective and tragic.<br /><br />DVD FEATURES<br />On Amazon it says the theatrical version is presented in Full Screen only but Disc I contains both Full Screen and Wide Screen versions. - Feature commentary by Writer/Director Rob Zombie as well.<br /><br />Disc II<br />Alternate Ending - Deleted Scenes with optional Directory's commentary - Bloopers- The Many Masks of Michael Myers - Re Imagining Halloween - Meet the cast - Casting Sessions - Laurie Strode Scree Test - Theatrical Trailer.<br /><br />I have seen both the unrated and theatrical versions and theatrical version is the one to go with by a mile.  The unrated just throws in to many over the top incidents that really aren't needed.</p></body></html>

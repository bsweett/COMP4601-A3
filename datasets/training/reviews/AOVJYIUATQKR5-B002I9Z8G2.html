I was tempted to make this my #1 favorite Star trek movie, but Wrath of khan won out.  Within my family though this is the children favorite ST movie.  The borg are cool.  They like the Obe Dobe song.  They love the "Mean Queen".  Stewart is terrific as Picard, and I will miss him in future ST movies.  Maybe frakes can pick it up.  Or how about some movies about Captain Archer!</p></body></html>

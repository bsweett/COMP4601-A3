After all, they both deal with a war between vampires and humans. The reality of the situation, however, is that had the filmmakers here tried to do a stupid American remake of a brilliant British TV miniseries, the end result, no matter how bad, would have been far better than this plotless mess. As far as I can tell, the script for this was cribbed together by someone who'd watched at least a thousand action movies and thought "wouldn't it be cool to take all the best scenes from all these and put them together in one flick?".  To be fair, they did a pretty good job of that. There are a lot of well-done action scenes to be found here. The problem is that the "story" holding them together is tissue-thin, with characters for whom "cardboard" would be a higher-rent district. And for some reason it bugs the hell out of me that Wimmer, along with all the other movies he's stolen scenes from here, also cannibalized his own work (more than one scene was lifted straight from Equilibrium). The only thing to recommend this is one brief, badly-lit shot of Milla Jovovich's rear end. I'm sure I've seen worse movies this month, but offhand I can't think of one. (half)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Toy Story 3 continues the trilogy's two expanding, disturbing themes - Abandonment and Incorrigible Villainy"></head><body><p>***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />Let me establish at the outset that I have savored and appreciated all three "Toy Story 3" movies for their charm, latent sly satire, cliffhanging adventure, and vivid characters.  At the same time, however, the trilogy continues two dark, harsh themes - abandonment/death and set-in-stone villainy - without really addressing either one squarely.  As the trilogy progressed, first Woody, then Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl, then eventually ALL of the toys confronted abandonment, obsolesence, and even destruction.  The flaming inferno of the garbage incinerator at "Toy Story 3"'s (hereafter TS3's) climax was an indelible symbol of toy oblivion.  But because TS3 is of course a Disney/Pixar movie, no toy buys the farm, not even the suavely ruthless Lotso Hugging Bear.  This is understandable; TS3 would have taken a dive profit-wise even if a minor toy character had been destroyed.  However, TS3 kicks the abandonment can down the road toward the movie's end, where young adult Andy bequeaths all his toys, even Woody whom he improbably wanted to take to college with him, to the little girl who was his neighbor.  Many viewers hail this as an intensely emotional scene, but I think the scene is somewhat overrated because we never knew enough about Andy to be emotionally invested in his sacrifice, and anyway the toys didn't really care about who played with them (as long as they were gentle, of course).  Furthermore, the abandonment issue is not resolved because someday the little girl will become a big girl, and the toys will have to face their abandonment/mortality all over again.  Perhaps that is TS3's morbid point.<br /><br />More distressing is the theme that permeates almost any Disney or Pixar animated feature - once a villain always a villain.  As far as I am aware, the only Disney animated villain, major or minor, who ever repented of his wickedness (at least kinda) was Iago the parrot in the Aladdin movies.  But in the Toy Story trilogy, neither Sid, nor Stinky Pete, nor Lotso rise above bitter evil vindictiveness.  In TS3, Lotso seemed to have a shot at redemption.  We learn of his and his giant baby doll henchman's abandonment by the side of a road by his thoughless female owner.  Woody saves Lotso's life from the conveyor belt leading to the incinerator.  But in the final analysis, the evil force is too strong with Lotso. He forsakes all the toys, compatriots and non-compatriots, to their fiery fate as he attempts to escape. Yet poetic justice intervenes; for his misdeeds, Lotso suffers, not fiery death, but perhaps a worse fate, being pinned to a bug-infested garbage truck grill with other unlucky stuffed animals.  I don't think irredeemable evil is a theme you should sell to impressionable young minds.  It would be nice to demonstrate that, yes, sometimes an evil character can atone for his misdeeds.<br /><br />I don't mean to make TS3 sound so sinister.  For the most part, it is light, cheery, upbeat, and howlingly funny (especially Mr. Potato Head's turn as Tortilla Man).  But it does have a dark underbelly, which in and of itself is not bad, and is actually commendable, but it does not directly deal with that underbelly, and that is not so commendable.<br /><br />3.5 stars out of five.</p></body></html>

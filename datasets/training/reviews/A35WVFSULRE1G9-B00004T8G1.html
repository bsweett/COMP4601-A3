NOTHING NEW, different color case, provoking potential buyers to get this, that its an upgrade, not hardly. Execs. want a few more bucks in there pockets with the remake coming out soon. People, be original, leave classic films alone, I have never seen a remake that was better. They ever try to remake Jaws, I'll steal every film negative and burn them. Upgrade Jaws fine, like Star Wars, a little cgi for the phony shark scenes but that is it. The Fog is awesome, but the remake differs, I bet the music is different, obviously the story is, because someone is trapped under water in a car being chased by a ghost. So the teenage market probably has no idea there is a Carpenter version, rerelease the original, it stands the test of time. The new version was never even screened to reviewers untill after its release. That says alot, no confidence, hollywood moguls suck. Gee why not redo every Brady Bunch episode with new hip people, NOT. I balk at this dvd release. The film, 5 stars, this reissue 0.</p></body></html>

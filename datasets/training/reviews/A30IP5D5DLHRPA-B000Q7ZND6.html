<meta name="summary" content="Left Me Confused at Points, But Not Bad Nonetheless"></head><body><p>I'd like to give this movie a 3.75/5, making it a solid B movie.  Here's why.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />I don't know what it is about the devil that is just scary enough as is, that's just me though.  There were some points that did make me jolt in my seat a little, such as the opening scene when the guy gets "hit" by the car.  Thriller wise the movie is not bad, good usage of camera angles, music and themes but nothing we have not already seen.<br /><br />Believe it or not, but it was quite humorous in some spots.  The humor mostly revolved around Constantine's jerk attitude towards Weisz' character and the devil when he meets him.  There were one or two moments, where I had to applaud his jerk-like behavior... well, one really and you'll know it when you see it.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The plot was extremely hard to follow at times.  When the devil appeared and took action, I had to ask my friend next to me why in hell he was doing that... turns out I missed it amongst the dialogue that was lost amongst other things.  Other parts, I had no clue what was going on, the screenwriters could've done a much better job at making some things more obvious than others.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves cannot act worth his life, although I saw double the amount of Keanu's facial expressions in Constantine than I saw in The Matrix... namely two.  Weisz is quite the looker and you get a little bit of fanboy service, but it's still somewhat bland.<br /><br />All in all, not bad of a movie but not something I'd want to see again and again over the span of say... my life.</p></body></html>

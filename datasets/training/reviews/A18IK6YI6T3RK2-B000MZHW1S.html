<meta name="summary" content="DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER"></head><body><p>Frankly, Im not the biggest DiCaprio fan, but i really liked him in this, he was very believable as a white Rhodisian, though his accent goes in and out, sometimes it is spot on and other times it is...well..not..The movie has a brisk pace and it very violent, but it always felt real and you really want the characters to succeed.  The film has an authentic feel, I suppose from the fact it was accually filmed in Africa.  If this movie does not have you rethinking your diamond purchase, you need to check your ekg, you may be missing your heart.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

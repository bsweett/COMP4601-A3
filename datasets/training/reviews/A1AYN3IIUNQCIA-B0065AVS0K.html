<meta name="summary" content="the next pulp fiction"></head><body><p>i love Sin City. its now one of my favorite movies, its true what people are saying it is the next Pulp Fiction. the story like Pulp fiction has three storys that very briefly interlock. the first story is about Marv, a thug who awakes to find the hooker Goldie whom he slept with is dead. taking justice into his own hands he finds out her killer is a canibalistic maniac named Kevin. the second is about Dwight who after defending a bartender from a crooked man named Jackie boy follows him to Old Town, a red light distrivt area. after a grave misunderstanding he kills Jackie boy and finds out he's a cop and now the truce of Old Town is gone. now Dwight must get rid of the body and its evidence. the final story is about Hartigen who in the begining of the story saves a girl name Nancy Callihan from a raving raper named Junior. finding iut its the senators son he is sent to jail and charged for all of his sons crimes. Nancy thanks him and writes under an alias but after eight years the letters stop and he fears she was found. confessing to everything he tracks down and finds she is now a stripper at a club and realizes...he was set up. now he must protect Nancy from the same lunatic who tried to kill her. i recomand this to any one because it is a great movie, great cast, and is set in the great times of black and white.</p></body></html>

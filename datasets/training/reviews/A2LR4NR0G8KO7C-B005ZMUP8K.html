<meta name="summary" content="Way too smooth"></head><body><p>The first movie already contained a lot of bollocks, but this practically identical sequel just goes beyond a certain limit. Again we find brave Will, spice girl Elisabeth and Captain Jack Sparrow up against a seemingly invincible opponent, Captain Davy Jones who has, yes here the bollocks really kicks off seriously, a face made of octopus. Jones and his also half man half fish crew have controls over a huge sea monster and live under water. Sofar the real scary plot...everything is just way too smooth. There are no real bad guys and all violence comes with a smile. In that case I rather watch the old A-team series again instead of this. Part three will be out next year and no doubt it will break new records again. It is impossible for true film fans to love this movie. (SARR)</p></body></html>

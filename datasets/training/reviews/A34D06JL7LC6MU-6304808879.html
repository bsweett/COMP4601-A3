<meta name="summary" content="A Very Satisfying Horror Film"></head><body><p>This is the first film by Clive Barker, whom Stephen King called "the future of horror fiction." Hellraiser spawned a couple sequels, a couple more direct-to-video sequels, and a Freddy/Jason-like horror icon in the form of Pinhead. What we have here is not just a landmark horror film, but a pretty good one too.<br /><br />A man buys a puzzle box and is seen messing with it in a basement (attic? Who cares). Moments later, he is ripped to shreds. Enter Larry and Julia who are moving into a house that has recently been vacated by Larry's brother Frank. What Larry doesn't know is that Julia had an affair with Frank and harbors a fanatical obsession with him. When Larry cuts his hand open and the blood drips through the floorboards, Frank is reawakened. Problem is, he looks like a rotting corpse...So; he enlists Julia to assist him in bringing victims to the house so he can eventually fully regenerate and escape before the mysterious cenobites get ahold of him.<br /><br />Of course this synopsis plays down the role of both Larry's daughter Kirsty and the cenobites, but I don't want to give too much away.<br /><br />Hellraiser was made in the 80s and like almost all 80s horror movies; some parts haven't aged very well. Furthermore, some of the acting is less-than-spectacular, particularly the two Franks. Frank, before he's ripped apart, is played by Sean Chapman. This guy's line delivery is hilarious (although, apparently dubbed). Frank in monster form is played by Oliver Smith. Smith looks 100% frightening, but once again...Some of his delivery is just a bit off. On the other hand however...There are several examples of poor dialogue throughout this movie.<br /><br />The make-up effects however are exceptionally good, give or take a few scenes (i.e., Frank being ripped apart in the beginning). An example of some of the good makeup effects is a rather grotesque scene in which Frank is being reanimated by Larry's blood. There is something gag-inducing for you.<br /><br />Then, there are the sadomasochistic cenobites. The cenobites are some of the creepier, unique creations of horror cinema. Doug Bradley as the Lead Cenobite (that's right ladies and gentlemen, he's not actually called Pinhead in this film) gives the best performance in the film. Yes, he is given the best dialogue but he's actually really quite good. The Pinhead make-up and latex look very real and Bradley makes the character genuinely menacing and creepy. Pinhead is a horror icon for a very good reason.<br /><br />Hellraiser is not a great film by any stretch of the imagination (few horror films are), but it is a very satisfying horror movie. Even the sub-par acting isn't bad enough to take away from that. If you like your horror films bloody, depraved, grotesque, and unique...This is your horror film.<br /><br />GRADE: B</p></body></html>

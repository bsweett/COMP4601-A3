<meta name="summary" content="Yet another release (and not the last) of "Star Wars" & we finally get the 1977 unaltered version with mixed results"></head><body><p>If George Lucas wants to tinker with his films until he dies I don't have a problem with that as long as he makes the films that fans fell in love with available. Finally we get the unaltered original "Star Wars". There's no new digital effects, no additions to the plot and we also get the digitally enhanced, altered version in the same package. So how does the picture look for the 1977 version? It looks fair compared to current standards for DVD. Using the original 1993 transfers for laserdisc as the source Lucasfilm cleaned up the original a bit in preparation for its DVD debut. It's not presented in anamorphic widescreen (which means the picture quality isn't as good as for the other version. That translates to less lines of resolution and a less sharp picture overall). Colors are inconsistent but considering the age of the film that's not surprising. The images are darker and there's a lot of film grain evident again no surprise. It's a pity that the film wasn't cleaned up more and restored for its DVD debut but we'll probably see some enhancement in that area (one hopes) in the deluxe boxed set that Lucas plans next year for the 30th Anniversary of Star Wars.<br /><br />I do find it disturbing though that Lucas made no effort to restore the film. It's almost like a spoiled child giving you something you've asked for. They DO hand it over but there's a lot of pouting and it's clear that it's not something they want to do. I would think that Lucas who grew up on classic horror, science fiction and adventure films would appreciate wanting the films the same way that he remembers them. It's a way to relive those childhood moments and pass them on to your children as well. I would still think that he's proud of his accomplishment of turning a $10 million movie into a $200 million + blockbuster that connected with audiences and present it in the best way possible (much how "Veritgo" or even "Touch of Evil" were restored for home video). I'd suggest a nice long talk with Robert Harris who restored "Rear Window" and "Vertigo". 3 stars for the image and sound quality of the first film 5 stars for the second.<br /><br />The digitally enhanced version looks terrific. I didn't see any differences here compared to the previous release. It's basically the same transfer as before with the same extras as the previous release of a couple of years ago. If you must have the original 1977 release this is the only set to buy.</p></body></html>

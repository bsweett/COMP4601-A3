Sure often his films are quite bizarre, gothic, and quite a bit quirky. At times they can be a mit morbid and he tends to rely on visuals rather than plot or a huge amount of character development. Nevertheless, Burton's films remain as some of the most imaginative movies being made.<br /><br />Take for instance his latest picture, THE CORPSE BRIDE.  Even though the film took around 5 years to be made, it has been released just a few months after Burton's fairly successful CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (the studios wanted to ride the coat tails of CHARLIE's hype). The movie is a stop-motion animated film and is based off an old Ukrainian folk tale. In the story, we have young Victor.  Victor is the son of a wealthy and up and coming fish marketer.  His father and mother were impoverished people, but through hard work and free enterprise have become wealthy. Wealthy enough, in fact, that one of the town's most established families wants to have their daughter, Victoria married to Victor.  Victor and Victoria have never met; it is an arranged marriage.  Upon meeting each other the couple connects and they realize very much that they want to be married to each other. However, Victor is a nervous person and can't seem to remember his lines at the wedding rehearsal.  The rehearsal is characterized as a disaster and Victor seeks shelter in the forest so that he might practice his lines.<br /><br />Practice he does. Until finally he has them down pat. Place the wedding ring for Victoria upon a limb of what he assumes is a dead branch, he says his lines perfectly. Except, the branch really wasn't a branch but was the finger of the Corpse Bride:  a young woman named Emily who was murdered on the spot while awaiting for her beloved to take her away. Victor is chased, faints, and visits the underworld.  Meanwhile the plot thickens above ground as Victoria's parents arrange for her to be married to a sly, older newcomer who has devilish plans of his own.  Victor is presented with the challenge of trying to get back to Victoria, yet not hurt Emily while remaining true to his ideals and sense of honor.  The Corpse Bride on the other hand has to decide if she is willing to have love ever after, but at the sake of hurting another in the same way that she was.<br /><br />THE CORPSE BRIDE isn't a movie for young children. However, it is an entertaining film that those over the age of 11 on up can enjoy.  I enjoyed watching this film.  There were a few moments that were quite funny, e.g. the skeleton band and some that were a little frightening, e.g. when the dead all rise and march to church for a wedding.  However, there really isn't anything in the movie that is gross, sick, or graphic. I highly recommended the movie for any Buron fan, fans of stop-animation, and anyone who has an interest in the macarbe or Eastern European folktales.</p></body></html>

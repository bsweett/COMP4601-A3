My personal fave is season 2 but the first season had some great episodes as well. My favorite episode from season 1 is The House of the Rising Sun. A lot of characters were killed off this season and I won't give away who. Matthew Fox, Evangeline Lilly, and Terry O'Quinn are my fave series regulars, impressive and talented actors. I highly recommend this flashback frenzy show, enjoy!</p></body></html>

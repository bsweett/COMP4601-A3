<meta name="summary" content="Not Enough "Iron Man" in This Sequel"></head><body><p>SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />Word has it that Robert Downey Jr. requested the screenwriting services of Justin Theroux, who was one of the writers of Tropic Thunder.  Tropic Thunder was hilarious.  Iron Man 2, overall, was not.  It seemed like a poor attempt for Robert Downey Jr. and Justin Theroux to make Iron Man more comedic.  Jon Favreau should have known better.  While Iron Man has some funny moments here and there, the character is not supposed to be funny overall.  We had some light moments in the original film that worked really well.  But in the end, Stark was true to his goal and he took it seriously.  In this film, Stark seems to take nothing serious at all.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 tries to be a lighter movie than the previous one, while taking on a "darker" spin on the character of Tony Stark and his new nemesis, Ivan Vanko, aka Whiplash.  Iron Man 2 fails on both fronts.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 isn't nearly has fun and innovative as the first film; a movie that had plenty of action and charm, with enough characterization for Tony Stark, Pepper Potts, and Obadiah Stane.  In this film, Iron Man casually makes only a couple of appearances, and it isn't enough to keep the audience involved.  Tony Stark dominates the film.  We see very little of Pepper Potts at all, and what could have been a great character in Ivan Vanko, is all but placed secondary to the very goofy Justin Hammer, poorly played by Sam Rockwell.<br /><br />Tony Stark's battle with alcoholism is addressed here.  In the comic books, it is tragic, and we see the fall of a great character and his battle to overcome it.  In this film, they chose to make Stark look like a buffoon.  He spends his time drunk, dancing around ridiculously in his Iron Man suit, and even making a silly bathroom stunt by "showing" his fellow party friends how Iron Man goes to the bathroom in his suit of armor.  It doesn't work.  The laughs that the filmmakers were hoping for were sporadic at best when I was at the premiere showing.<br /><br />Ivan Vanko is actually a combination of two villains...Whiplash and the Crimson Dynamo.  They actually set up a good premise with this character; a Russian man who is the son of an inventor who worked with Tony's father.  When tragedy struck Ivan's father, he obviously holds Tony Stark responsible and vows revenge.  Taking on the mantle of "Whiplash," and utilizing the same technology that powers Stark's Iron Man suit, Vanko creates two energy whips that can cut through metal like butter.  It's too bad that we're only given one short battle between Iron Man and Whiplash before, in a very predictable fashion, Vanko ends up fighting Iron Man in, guess what?  Another suit of armor!<br /><br />In the comics, Justin Hammer is a cold, ruthless man who views Stark as an obstacle that must be removed, since he runs a rival company.  Instead, we're treated to Sam Rockwell who makes Hammer look clueless in anything he does.  It's truly sad that one of Iron Man's premiere villains was reduced to this.  Normally, I don't like to bring up comic book comparisons, but in this case, they completely missed the boat with this character.  Rockwell plays Hammer like he, himself, has no idea what the character is like or what he is supposed to be about.<br /><br />Don Cheadle takes over as Rhodey and he does a good job with the character.  We are treated to the addition of "War Machine," the armored superhero that Rhodey becomes.  Gwyneth Paltrow's character didn't have enough screen time, and her interactions as Pepper Potts with Tony Stark are too few and far between.  This is a shame because these two characters worked very well in the previous film.  The light banter between Potts and Stark in the previous installment is nearly gone in this film.<br /><br />Another great character that we see way too little of is Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow.  People seemed to wake up in their seats when she finally takes to the screen in her tight, black outfit and making short work of a score of guards when she breaks into Hammer's facility.  Too little screen time hurt the characterization of what should have been an interesting character.  Many superhero films make the big mistake of having too many characters.  This film finds itself among those.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 has a few redeeming things that keep it from becoming a total failure.  The actions scenes are, for the most part, well done.  Unfortunately, we see too few of them.  The attention to detail as Iron Man soars through the skies in the original film have disappeared in this film.  It's too bad.  So many people were in awe when Iron Man first takes to the skies in the first film.  The special effects are still top rate.  It's too bad there wasn't a good enough story to go with it.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 has its moments here and there.  It's worth one viewing, but frankly, I'm casting this one aside with Spider-Man 3, Superman Returns, Ghost Rider, and some of the other "failed" superhero films.  I don't know if any recent comic book film held such anticipation for its fans, and ended up being such a bitter disappointment.<br /><br />With Favreau, Downey Jr., and the rest of this talented bunch, they should have been able to deliver.  They didn't.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I Loved this Movie!!!!"></head><body><p>Catch Me If You Can is based on the true life story of one of the most successful con artists in history - Frank Abagnale Jr. ( Leonardo Dicaprio). Frank is able to assume several different identities including a Secret Service agent, an airline pilot, a doctor, and a history professor to cash more than $2.5 million in fraudulent checks in the United States, as well as 26 other countries.  Carl Hanratty ( Tom Hanks) is the lead FBI agent in the Checks Fraud division that is tracking Abagnale, and is determined to take him down no matter what. "Catch Me If You Can" takes us on an exciting and extremely entertaining cat and mouse chase between the two men. <p>"Catch Me If You Can" is without a doubt the best film I have seen in the last couple of years. The film's screenplay was an extremely accurate adaptation of the book that was written by Frank himself. The story was absolutely perfect to bring to the big screen, simply because of how successfull Frank was. He managed to accomplish everything before he was 19. The overall direction from Stephen Spielberg was amazing. The film is paced extremely well, and even though it is almost 2 1/2 hours running, the film never seems long or drawn out. The set designs were also extremely authentic, and Spielberg was able to get the best performances possible out of the actors. <p>The overall cast was just great in this movie. Each actor was the perfect choice for their particular role. I am not a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. But I must admit, that he turned in an outstanding performance and captured the true essance of Frank Abignale Jr. He is cunning, intelligent, and witty. This let him play the different identities of lawyer, teacher, doctor, etc, so convincingly. Tom Hanks was brilliant as Carl Hanratty. He will amaze you with the determination he gives in tracking Abignale. Hanks will also make you laugh because of his Boston accent, and also because of how extremely naive he can be at times. At one point, Abignale is able to convince Carl that he is a Secret Service agent working on the case. Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Jennifer Gardner ( TV's "Alias"), and the rest of the cast put in top notch performances as well. Finally, the film is extremely fun to watch and down right hillarious. I was laughing for the majority of the film, and I actually had a good time watching Frank from one moment to the next. <p>"Catch Me If You Can" was easily the best film of 2002. The film provides - an extremely authentic portrayal of Frank Abignale Jr.'s life, wonderful performances, masterful directing from Spielberg, and non-stop laughs. Not to mention the DVD has some pretty good extras as well. I highly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Souless But Still a Grand Epic"></head><body><p>Technically, this movie is a blast.  For a geek like myself, it was fun sitting through the sections explaining how the movie got made.  There was the training of the stuntmen (but it conveniently left out the Bulgarians' strike for the extreme condition that they worked in and also the pay packets), how the scenes tied in together even when the location shoots were located at Mexico and Malta, the editing, the sound effects, et cetera.  The behind the scene segment also talked about what we already knew about the hurricane that destroyed the set, the delay due to reconstruction of the Troy fortress and waiting for Brad Pitt's achilles tendon to heel (ironic)?  In terms of the acting, it was good in patches but one couldn't help but notice that the acting was secondary to this grand spectacle when they had to strictly adhere to the structures to make sure that it worked like a clockwork.  Peter O'Toole was faultless in playing Priam and as Brad Pitt said himself, the scene of Priam asking for Hector's body back for a proper burial was the highlight of his career and understandly so.  Eric Bana was charismatic and tremendous as the reluctant and tormented Hector who fought for his beloved country, Troy and his obligation as a Prince and as a protector to his younger brother, Paris.  Brad Pitt was almost always criticised for being too good looking for his role but his presence in this movie was credible.  Sean Bean was faultless playing the king of Ithaca, a pragmatist ruler who mediated between Achilles and Argamenon and sided with the Greek for his country's livelihood.  Then, there was the priestess (an Australian girl whose name had escaped me) and also Achilles' love interest in this movie who stole every scenes that she was into.  Then, there was Brian Cox (reminding me so much of Dennis Hopper on a bad hair day), Orlando Bloom (not another epic movies with his involvement in it - yawn).  All these characters basically tied the whole movie together.  Despite that it's such a visually exciting movie, it is akin to Titanics, devoid of a soul which would make it a modern classics.  This disturbed me.  Perhaps, we all knew that this is a tragedy and in the end, everybody died.  There wasn't a just cause in this story and the massacre of people from both sides were simply senseless especially when we knew that it was all started of the vanity of Paris, falling in love with a married woman when he wasn't supposed to.  I would remember Bravehearts for we have a tendency to vouch for the underdogs especially when we know that  Conqueror was arrogant and devious in their conquest of Scotland.  We would also vouch for mel Gibson's character again in the Patriots for his family was under threat and as a father, he had to do what's necessary not simply to defend his family but also his country.  All of these were something that we would attach our feelings to but for a Greek tragedy that was almost four thousand years old, it's a bit difficult.  Wolgang Petersen wanted to do this movie because he missed his chance in the Gladiators but in the end, Gladiators, to me, scored on the emotional side as we had empathy for someone who had lost everything and to revenge against someone who had wronged him.  Anyhow, if you can overlook the mixture of accents in this movie, having Englishmen, Aussies, American, Bulgarians, Mexicans and if you can also overlook the faithfulness of this movie to the Greek tragedy, this is actually quite an entertainment movie to be shared around!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very Intriguing!"></head><body><p>This is a very different thriller, with one of the most intriguing characters I have seen in a thriller.  A body is pulled from the ocean with a couple of bullet holes in the back.  Amazingly, the man is still alive.  He is treated by the ship's physician and slowly brought back to health.  The only problem is that he lost his memory.  The physician finds a metal nugget in the man that projects a bank safety deposit box number.<br /><br />With no clue as to who he is, the man goes to the bank and is able to get to the box with his thumbprint as his identification.  Inside the box he finds a slew of passports, currency and weapons.  Each of the passports is under different names.  He uses the one that says Jason Bourne and when he uses it for travel, the immigration computer sets off a whole bunch of alarms to some CIA operatives that very much want him dead.<br /><br />At a US embassy, Jason eludes his assassins (through some highly refined combat techniques and climbing skills) and asks for a ride from a lady he saw at the embassy.  She takes him, unknowingly putting herself in danger.  The two of them need to unravel Jason's mystery as to who he is, why he has the skills that he has, and why are the government agents trying to kill him.<br /><br />Jason and the woman (Marie) head to Paris to an address that Jason lived at.  There Jason is attacked by a hitman who has photos of both Jason and Marie that were taken back at the embassy.  Suddenly Marie realizes that she is stuck with Jason fighting unknown enemies, just to stay alive.<br /><br />The movie is quite different than the book of the same name but is excellent nonetheless.  Matt Damon appears well cast and all the CIA operatives are excellent as well (Julia Styles plays one of them).  The actress that plays Marie does a passable job and there seems to be a good chemistry that evolves between her and Damon.<br /><br />A non-stop roller coaster ride with some great car chases thrown in.  This movie is one of the best thrillers that I have seen!</p></body></html>

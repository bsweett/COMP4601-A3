Each person must learn trough trials and tribulations to overcome his or her shortcomings; this requires each to rely on the unique abilities of others to survive. They must realize the dangers in lies and deceit; then they must repent. There is death and destruction. This is a rare instance where revenge is a motive for a good outcome.<br /><br />They could not have picked a better cast. I have the feeling that they were playing themselves. And the chemistry that usually is between one or two people was between them all. Tim Allen plays the Commander that, while relieving himself, comes to the realization that the other actors consider him a joke. When he gets second chances visa-vie the intrusion of an alien war, he invites the other actors to join him on the "Galaxy Quest". After you get over the initial shock of Sigourney Weaver's appearance, she makes you feel that she is Gwen DeMarco. She takes the job that life has handed her and turns it in to a positive.<br /><br />Move over Gene Roddenberry. I can't wait for the series.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />With the addition of Blu-ray, we now have many more DVD extras.

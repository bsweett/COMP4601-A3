<meta name="summary" content="'When man cannot choose, he ceases to be a man.'"></head><body><p>Which is better: to be capable of choice even if we use this capability to choose monstrous evil, or to be capable only of 'good' even if we are therefore incapable of real moral choice?<p>Anthony Burgess asked and answered this question in his haunting and disturbing novel _A Clockwork Orange_. Stanley Kubrick's stunning adaptation of the book to the screen succeeds at every level in conveying both the question and Burgess's preferred answer.<p>The film is rigorously staged and stylized, the graphic visual content often in fittingly violent conflict with the classical music of the soundtrack. The sex and violence are both repulsive and fascinating, as they must be in order to pose Burgess's question fairly (and to fulfill another purpose of Burgess's that he acknowledges in his introduction to the 1986 U.S. edition of the novel: 'to titillate the nastier propensities' of the audience).<p>Like the novel, the film features the unlikeliest 'hero' in the history of literature (and one of its greatest antiheroes). Alex is a sadistic teen gang leader with a taste for rape and destruction (and for Beethoven). Eventually, for reasons you will learn in the film, he's subjected to a groundbreaking behavior-modification treatment at the hands of a 'benevolent' State bent on reducing crime (partly in order to make room in the jails for political prisoners; incidentally, Burgess's book is also one of the finest man-vs.-the-State novels).<p>Malcolm McDowell is hypnotic in what is still the role of his lifetime. His moral choices during the first portion of the film will make you want to vomit. This guy isn't a handsome Cool Hand Luke charmingly lopping the heads off parking meters, or even a disarmingly free-spirited Randle Patrick McMurphy getting caught engaging in consensual sex with an underage girl. Alex is a violent thug, rapist, and (eventually) killer, and he does it all for the sheer fun of it. Far from being a likeable antiauthority figure, he will initially have you rooting for the authorities.<p>But after he (ironically enough) chooses to be subjected to the Ludovico treatment, you will find yourself on his 'side' (such as it is). The fact that Burgess is able to bring his reader to _sympathize_ with such a character is one of the novel's greatest achievements; Kubrick matches it point by point on the screen. (That's why this film is so much _better_ a 'countercultural'/'antiauthoritarian' film than even the admittedly great _Cool Hand Luke_ and _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_.)<p>The end of the film leaves something to be desired: namely, the final (twenty-first) chapter of Burgess's novel, which wasn't included in the original U.S. edition of the book. For some reason, even though the film was shot in the U.K., Kubrick elected not to incorporate this final chapter, with the effect that non-U.S. audiences were surprised at the abrupt and seemingly unfinished ending. U.S. audiences who have read the 1986 U.S. edition of the novel may feel likewise.<p>Whatever the merits of the omission, the film is not only great on its own terms but one of the greatest screen adaptations ever made of a novel. It will help a bit if you've read the book first, just because you'll have been thereby clued in to the largely Russian-based slang used by Alex and his droogs. But it's not necessary; as in the book, the screenplay gives you time and opportunity to adjust. In this respect and in every other, Kubrick's film stands just fine on its own merits.<p>This is one of the greatest motion pictures ever made. You'll need a strong stomach to watch it, but it will hold up under repeated viewings for as long as you can stand it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Great Film That Lives In The Spirit Of The Original But It Never Rises Above & Beyond"></head><body><p>MOVIE: Instead of giving us X-Men: The Last Stand, Bryan Singer decided to take a grander project first. The new Superman sequel has been anticipated for quite some time now, and it truly does live up to the hype. Superman Returns basically is set after Superman II, because I think everyone can agree that we may as well just pretend that numbers III and IV don't exist. Here we see Superman returning back to Earth to find that Lois Lane is now engaged as well as being a new mother. He comes back and also finds that planet Earth is still in chaos with crime and danger around every corner. Lex Luthor is Superman's villain in this sequel once again. Kevin Spacey steals the show as the eccentric pioneer, and suprisingly looks very much like Gene Hackman. Superman Returns is a good movie, it really is. However, I think what I found subpar about it was that it tried to make the man of steel this vulnerable and emotional character. The original films made this character an icon, a character with no weaknesses that could overcome anything. I mean sure, in the hero's journey there must always be some adversity that the main character needs to overcome in order for the plot to work, but for some reason I just never saw Superman as this complex character. I'm not saying that it was bad to make Superman more complex, in fact if I saw a replica of the original with nothing new to offer then I'd be trashing the movie. I really liked Superman Returns, but I just wasn't blown away by it like we were all expecting. The movie doesn't really offer us anything we haven't seen before in other superhero movies. I still think that Spider-Man is the film franchise to beat in this genre. On the technical side I can honestly say I was blown away. The CGI work was breathtaking and very detailed. I heard a lot of people complain about the length of the movie, but I never found it to drag at all. It is a great summer blockbuster, but it wasn't great enough to make me anticpate the next installment in the franchise.<br /><br />ACTING: Newcomer Brandon Routh is a perfect fit for the character. His acting was not stilted or dull, and he really added great depth to the character. He had lots of great stuff to work with though, and that definately helped. Kate Bosworth did a fine job but she felt incredibly cold as a character. It seems like she was mad at Superman and that in turn made her mad at everyone else, even her son and fiance. There was no warmth from Lois Lane, and that made the romance of it all feel very dull. Kevin Spacey steals the show and does an amazing job as the power hungry Lex Luthor who plans to grow his own continent. Kevin Spacey was so good that at times I thought he overpowered the Superman character, which I thought hurt the film a little as well.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Bryan Singer definately crafted a well made superhero movie, but when there is a superhero movie in the theater almost every few months sometimes "well made" is not enough. The only problem with Superman Returns is that it played it safe and didn't change that much. For example, Batman Begins completely reinvented the franchise and gave us a completely fresh new movie to enjoy. Superman Returns is great, but we've seen it all before.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I wanted so much to like it!"></head><body><p>But when it was done, all I wanted to do was re-write it. Fix it, make it better. It was, to be honest, awful. Absolutely nothing like Pitch Black, which was a solid Sci-Fi movie; this was a sort of sci-fi-fnatasy-horror-mix, and a badly done one. It could have been so good, if only the'd done a bit more reasoning and a bit less wandering around.<br /><br />Riddick is living alone on an ice world when bounty hunters chase him down - blah, blah - the plot gets complicated (unnecessarily so) from there on out. Oh, I SO want to fix this movie. It really had so much potential and it wasted all of it. Just, someone, give me a budget and I swear I'll make it all better...<br /><br />It makes me angry just thinking about it. Grrrr. If Vin Deisel were here I'd yell at him.</p></body></html>

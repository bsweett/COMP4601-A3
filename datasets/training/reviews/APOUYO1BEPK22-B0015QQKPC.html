The race for the moon is over, and America isn't even interested anymore in `routine' flights to the moon anymore. That is until reports come in that there is major trouble going on on the spacecraft. As the pilots are on their way to the moon, an explosion happens somewhere inside their ship. Major problem after major problem begins to happen. The routine mission to the moon has just become an intellectual fight for survival... and now a mission to get home. 250 thousand miles in space inside a ship that feels like the size of two phone booths, Jim, Fred, and Jack use their brains and their guts to fly to the dark side of the moon to slingshot themselves hopefully back to earth. Power is diminishing, Carbon Dioxide is building, engines are failing, and the freezing cold is piercing. The true story of Apollo 13.<br /><br />Never gets old. No matter how many times I see this movie, it just never gets old. I've probably seen it at least 5 times now and I'm still glued to my seat. How is this a real story? Honestly it's so miraculous and incredible the things that happened and the things that were done to get these guys home that it seems fake. But it's not. It's crazy to think how close to death these guys were in such a foreign area such as space. Even the guys in Houston were having a hard time believing that so much was going wrong at one time. At one time the crew had to sit in the lunar lander to fly home. The thing about that is that most of the walls are just a millimeter thick (not even that much). So they had to watch where they stretched out so they didn't puncture a whole in the wall and suck themselves out.<br /><br />Ron Howard's direction of the movie was incredible. Not once did I get bored. Everything was done just right. From the story, to the characters, the little jokes here and there, to the action, to the suspense. It's got it all. And with a cast that consists of Tom Hanks (Lovell), Bill Paxton (Haise), Kevin Bacon (Swigert), Gary Sinise (Ken Mattingly), and Ed Harris (Gene Kranz), how could you really go wrong? Every performance was littered with emotion for the story or for who they were playing. It seemed like everyone wanted to do their best to make this movie memorable for us as the viewer, and more importantly for the people who they portrayed and the story that was being told.<br /><br />After the movie was over this time, I was still caught up in the story so I immediately pushed play on The Making of Apollo 13. I HIGHLY recommend watching this. There was a LOT of real footage used in this documentary. From Nixon's speech to seeing the actual ship that exploded float off to space while we get to see the actual damage. Incredible. Also it's really neat to see how spot on the movie was to the actual event that happened. While the doc is going on, parts of the movie would happen, and then we'd see or hear the actual events happen (or vice versa...I can't remember). It was really cool to hear "Houston we have a problem" from Lovell himself. And while they do show a lot of actual events, they also show some really funny stuff too. Watching how they did the floating in space parts was really cool. I've known about airplane flights that take you up and then drop real fast to give you the zero gravity feel. I actually looked into doing last year but it's a tad expensive (like a thousand bucks...eesh). I just didn't really think they would do it. But they did. A lot of the shots are actually in an airplane doing this and the actors all did it. It was funny to watch them floating around and then hit the bottom of the plane when the plane would come up from the dive.<br /><br />In the end, I highly recommend this movie for anyone. Incredible movie on an incredible true event in America's history.<br /><br />P.S. What happened to Kevin Bacon? Like he looks like a normal guy in this movie, but man he's starting to look a lot like Skeletor in more of his recent movies.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hey McFly!!!"></head><body><p>The summer of 1985. What a wonderful time in the cinemas that was for a little kid like me. After witnessing "The Goonies", another cherished childhood movie, I went and saw the first BTTF movie. Another defining childhood moment at the movies. The wonder and magic of that first film, and the subsequent sequels, is still strong today. All of the wonderfulness that is the original movie and the trilogy as a whole, is collected here in this box set with a worthwhile pile of fun and wonderful extras. Since you already probably know the films and stories, there is no real need to go into detail with all three films. The basic premise is teenager Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox)going into the past to 1955, thanks to Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd) and his DeLorean time machine, and has to get his mother and father together or he will never be born. The resulting sequels has Marty and the Doc going into adventures in the future(part 2), and going back to the wild, wild west(part 3). There is no denying the wonderful and whimsical charm and brilliance of the original film, thanks to Robert Zemeckis' wonderful direction and script(with Bob Gale), the endearing characters, and many wonderful set pieces. The sequels don't fail to entertain, but the original can't be touched. Part 2 was all over the place and showcased Zemeckis and Gale's wonderful vision and creativeness. Part 3 was more simpler, and returned to the softer charm of the original. The load of extras here is a major treat. All 3 films come with the same set of extras. Deleted scenes, outtakes, music videos, screen tests, etc. The little documentaries and behind the scenes stuff is great. All 3 films come with short specials that were originally done at the time of each film's release. All 3 also come with new documentaries discussing each film, and the second one finally tells me why Crispin Glover didn't reprise his role. Director/co-writer Robert Zemeckis and co-writer Bob Gale are the main people present in all 3. Fox appears here and there. No Lea Thompson. No Thomas Wilson. No Christopher Lloyd(I hear he never does interviews). No Crispin Glover. That was kind of disappointing. Otherwise, it's fun stuff. There is also some page to screen comparisons, and some behind the scenes look at the hoverboard creation and designing the town square of Hill Valley. This is definitley a collection worthy of high praise, and worthy of being in your own DVD collection. It's a series of films that are looked upon very fondly, and rightfully so. That summer of 1985 was one that made huge impressions on me, and BTTF can be thanked for that. Pick it up.</p></body></html>

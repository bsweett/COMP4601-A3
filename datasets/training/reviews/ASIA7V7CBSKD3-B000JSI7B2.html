<meta name="summary" content="Jack The Ripper"></head><body><p>A Great film about the world's first serial killer.  Crafted in a way that some part of the film it is hard to distinguish between Hollywood Glam and Historical Fact.  Very entertaining and Johnny Depp reveals an excellent English accent (which can at times be heard in his "Jack Sparrow" voice).  Also, for those looking to be entertained by stories similiar to "the Da Vinci Code," checkout "From Hell" as the Freemasons make an appearance.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="HooDoo"></head><body><p>"The Skeleton Key" is a good thriller with an expert cast headed by Kate Hudson (Caroline), Gena Rowlands (Violet) and a mute John Hurt (Ben).<br /><br />Director Iain Softley (the stunning "Wings of a Dove") has a great eye for the grotesque and the beauty that lies therein and his mise en scene is cluttered with over-hanging Ivy, cataract-blinded country folk, crumbling mansions with scary attics, sweat-inducing humidity and back-woods depravity vs. upper crust, tuxedoed depravity in the bayou country just outside of New Orleans.<br /><br />There are also great big doses of Hoodoo thrown in to spice-up this boiling Gumbo of a movie but for once the attitude of the film, thanks to Softley and the amazing cast, is one of tolerance and respect: "The Skeleton Key" has the good sense to believe in it's own themes and characters and as a consequence it scares the hell out of us because, despite our better judgment... we start to buy into it also.</p></body></html>

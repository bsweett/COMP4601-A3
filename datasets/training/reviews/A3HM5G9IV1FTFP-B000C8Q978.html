<meta name="summary" content="Subtleties"></head><body><p>"Broken Flowers" is just the kind of film I love: It's equal parts funny and sad, intelligently written, beautifully shot, and directed by someone smart enough to get out of the way and let the outstanding actors shine. And shine they do. Once again Bill Murray, as Don Johnston, is understated, and once again it works, allowing the rest of the cast to flesh out their richly idiosyncratic characters. The journey is Don's, but the film really belongs to the actresses who play his former lovers. Don sees himself, and the world, differently through the eyes of each of these four women. The beauty lies in the subtleties: the glimpse of nudity that Laura's (Sharon Stone) daughter un-self-consciously allows Don, the desperate looks Dora (Francis Conroy) shoots to Don over dinner with her obnoxious, soulless husband, the hostility that seethes under the surface of Carmen (Jessica Lange), or Don's strangely unsurprised reaction when he's attacked by Penney's (Tilda Swinton) backwoods companions. Rich, dreamy, and bittersweet, "Broken" never looked so good.</p></body></html>

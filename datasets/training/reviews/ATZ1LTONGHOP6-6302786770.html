<meta name="summary" content="Enriches the "Dark Tower" novels"></head><body><p>Set against the backdrop of the American Civil War, three men, one "good" (Clint Eastwood), one bad (Lee Van Cleef) and one "ugly" (Eli Wallach), race to find $200,000 in buried gold.<br /><br />At the time of writing this review, "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" was number 4 in the IMDb Top 250. Although it is a very well made movie, with impressive cinematography, and one of the most memorably scores of all time, storywise, it's not actually all that great a film and there are many other westerns that are far superior ("Rio Bravo" and "High Noon" are two that spring to my mind). Its main problem is that it is just far too long. The story is a relatively simple one, but it takes about an hour (out of 2 1/2) for the main goal of the characters to become apparent, and the remainder of the film is cluttered with many scenes that, although interesting as stand-alone scenes, don't do anything to further the story. To add insult to injury, Lee Van Cleef's character vanishes for a good chunk of the film, making him an incredibly ineffective villain.<br /><br />In the film's favour, "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" was one of Stephen King's inspirations for writing the Dark Tower series of novels, and even though I didn't particularly like this film, as a King fan, I did find it interesting to watch this film in order to learn what was in King's mind when he wrote these books. Seeing the landscapes of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" enriched my vision of the "Dark Tower" world and actually made me want to re-read these novels.<br /><br />Overall, I would strongly recommend this film for fans of Stephen King's "Dark Tower" books, but if you're not a King fan and not into the Western genre, then you're probably not going to enjoy this film at all.</p></body></html>

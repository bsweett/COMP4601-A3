<meta name="summary" content="I have to agree..."></head><body><p>With the majority so far here...this picture, panned almost to a man by the critics, was actually as enjoyable as I thought it would be before I started hearing the avalanche of negative reviews. Why did they hate this film so much?! It has NON-stop action, great art direction, good casting, (I am in love with Peta WIlson!) a nice, world-threatening plot, (probably yet another nod to Connery,) and passable special effects.<br /><br />Perhaps it was the obvious hand that Marvel may have had in it...the whole movie reminds me an AWFUL lot of "Van Helsing",  what with Mr. Hyde having a prominent part in it, on top of the presence of Richard Roxburgh, who played Dracula in that movie. "Van Helsing" also, in turn, bore a strong resemblance to "X-2, X-Men United". CGI effects are also a lot more obvious in Marvel's movies than they are in anybody else's, and they are here...THAT could have been a put-off...but for me, the not-so-great CGI was hidden well enough by shadows so that it wasn't as bad as it was in "The Hulk" or "Spiderman".<br /><br />The group consists of: Allen Quartermain, (Connery...glad they didn't pick Richard Chamberlain,) Tom Sawyer, The Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, Captain Nemo, (wait 'til you see the Nautilus...WOW!) and a persona de femme from "Dracula", Mina Harker, played by Ms. Wilson. Dorian Grey is along for the ride, too, but how much can you trust a character made up by Oscar Wilde?<br /><br />It's great seeing Connery slug a villain and making it stick, at his age...(he's 77 now, can you believe it?) and Peta Wilson...YES!! Love that accent, love that stature, love that improvement-on-Julie-Christie thing she's got going for her....Love that car, too...I'll bet you anything either Panther Westwinds or Sbarro had something to do with that beast! That looked like a Lancia grille, too!<br /><br />Anyway, there is, indeed, non-stop action! You really do root for the good guys, especially after it's revealed that the group's being conned by a surprising source, and just marvelling at the great sets and cinematography used in the film is a kick. I highly recommend this underrated little film, one that the critics made look much worse than it is!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Energized remake of a masterpiece"></head><body><p>Not too long ago, in one of my reviews, I expressed my longing for the remake of George A. Romero's "Dawn of the Dead" to prove wrong the hoopla that the mass arrival of classic remakes was to no one's benefit. Marcus Nispel delivered a heavily stylized update of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" that really didn't improve on anything except cinematography (by the same DP of the original). The decision to give these films to virtual unknowns was a huge gamble on the behalf of the studios who financed these remakes, and this time, they got it right. Zach Snyder, with an assured hand and a respectful nod of the hat to his predecessor, has crafted a remake worthy of comparison to the original. Though not half as socially relevant or satirical of the times, this "Dawn of the Dead" blasts from start to finish with a single-minded energy that makes it the best of the remakes so far.<p>The opening of the film, rounding out at about ten minutes from production company logo to "Directed by Zach Snyder", is one of the most compelling, scary, pulse-pounding introductions I've ever seen. It deserves comparison to Takashi Miike's hellacious "Dead or Alive." Complete with Johnny Cash's fantastic musical accompaniment, it strikes a tone that is hard to live up to for the rest of the film, but Snyder does his best, and manages to come out on top.<p>The plot is simple, and has been done before, but rarely with such zest: An unexplained phenomenon (what explanation could possibly suffice?) sweeping the nation is turning human beings into flesh craving ghouls, quick on their feet, and vastly increasing in numbers. The disease, virus, or whatever it is, is only transferrable through the bites of the infected, no matter if it's a tiny nick or an artery-tearing gash. Sarah Polley very simply observes: "Bites killed her. Bites brought her back." Polley is one of the rogue's gallery of survivors that inhabit Crossroads Mall during the invasion, along with Ving Rhames' tough as nails policeman, Jake Weber's sensible divorcee, and Mekhi Phifer's desperate former felon. The acting in the remake is vastly superior to the original, and gives us a wider variety of characters to identify with, which is an important step because of the absence of Romero's looting bikers. These are, for the most part, likable people, and even the ones we would sooner see mauled to death have moments that make us laugh. ("Alright, we draw straws, and the loser runs across the lot with a ham sandwich.")<p>The best scenes of the film are between the Ving Rhames character and a gun store owner across the parking lot from the mall, named Andy. They converse through the use of binoculars and dry-erase marker boards, and even manage to play a game of chess. In one hilarious sequence that is on a par with the best satirical moments in the original film, the mall survivors pick out celebrity lookalikes in the zombie crowd and flash their names to Andy, across the way, who picks them off with a sniper rifle.<p>As I said before, "Dawn of the Dead" is pure energized filmmaking of a high caliber. It doesn't try and be Romero's original film, and in that way, it stands on its own, with its satire carefully concealed in its music (when the survivors first break into the mall, "Don't Worry Be Happy" plays over the speakers). The action sequences toward the end are shot half on film and half on digital video (a la "28 Days Later"), and in one effects shot, involving a propane tank and a flare, we get one of those rare moments that inspires applause during a film. This, combined with the performances, great makeup effects, an embrace of the gore that Romero pioneered, and that kinetic opening, make this a perfect companion piece to sit next to the original "Dawn" on collectors' shelves everywhere.</p></body></html>

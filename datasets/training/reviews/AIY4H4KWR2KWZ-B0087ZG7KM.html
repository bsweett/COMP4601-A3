<meta name="summary" content="What An Amazing Advertising Campaign - What A Pile Of Poo"></head><body><p>Huh. I really fell for that b.s. advertising campaign.<br /><br />Unusual for me as I'm normally quite adept at seeing through the manufactured manure. But give credit where credit is due - they caught a cynic and an experienced film fan. I got sold a pile of poo dressed up as a steak.<br /><br />Extremely disappointed would be an understatement.<br /><br />The campaign made this out as the female version of '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UV4XEW">The Hangover</a>', so I had very high expectations. This was NOTHING LIKE like that hilarious flick. This was...<br /><br />Geez, I don't know. I don't have a frame of reference to compare this to or with another film. Maybe something seen on the Lifetime Channel or Oxygen. Maybe.<br /><br />I suppose there were some silly moments, and Melissa McCarthy's occasional flatulence flare-ups and profanity laced commentary mildly livened things up a bit here and there. But there were stunningly long stretches of Kristen Wiig's character being overwhelmed, extraordinarily uncomfortable, and dealing with a mega heavy dose of soul-crushing low self-esteem.<br /><br />Ha ha?<br /><br />I don't get it.<br /><br />The body expulsion scenes were gross without any real sense of hilarity. That's a gimme in comedies. And it failed. What the bleep?<br /><br />And that was sixty-minutes worth of the film. The only real laugh out loud moment was... uhm.... there wasn't one. That was one tough hour let me tell you.<br /><br />The second hour... can you believe this was actually two bleeping hours long?!?!?!?!<br /><br />The second hour was the start of the "Vegas Trip" which was heavily advertised, and I completely don't get this part, but they didn't end up in Vegas. In fact, there isn't one scene in Vegas and the characters all return to their homes and lives in Wisconsin.<br /><br />&lt;deep breath><br /><br />And the downward spiral continues from there.<br /><br />&lt;sigh><br /><br />I haven't been this fooled before in a very long time. And how sad is it that an AC/DC song got pulled into this pile?<br /><br />Two hours, ten minutes, and sixteen seconds. I bet I'll want that back one day.<br /><br />So sad.<br /><br />One final note - what does it say when the funniest parts of this entire flick were the 15-second outtakes with, again, Melissa McCarthy?</p></body></html>

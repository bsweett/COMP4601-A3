<meta name="summary" content="A real success"></head><body><p>With the recent glut of similar cockney gangster movies that followed in the wake of 'Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels', Guy Ritchie is back to prove that he really is the master of this genre.  Okay so the plot involving a diamond heist and a boxing ring may not exactly be world-class but it's milked for all it's worth with several fantastic characters.  Maybe it's Ritchie's management of an ensemble cast that should really be applauded here.<p>'Snatch' is obviously geared more towards the American market than his previous movie, with the addition of Brad Pitt and a relatively small role for Benicio Del Toro.  The rest of the cast consists of various British actors, and there's even an appearance from jungle artist Goldie.  However, it is Brad Pitt that really steals the film in his best performance to date as an incomprehensible Irish gypsy.  Of course Vinnie Jones pops up again in yet another of his stereotypical roles, but he's still very funny so who's complaining?  It's depiction of hard gangsters and wannabe gangsters also fits in surprisingly well with the movie's artier tendences.  For instance, slow motion is used to great effect and the camera work for the fight scenes is genuinely inspired.<p>Finally though, 'Snatch' is absolutely hilarious with its quickfire conversation that doesn't patronise its audience.  Ritchie sure doesn't pull any punches.</p></body></html>

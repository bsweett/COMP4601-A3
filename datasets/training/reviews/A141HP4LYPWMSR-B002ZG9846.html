<meta name="summary" content=""I Never Play" ~ The Girl Your Mom Warned You About"></head><body><p>The 2010 release 'Kick Ass' is exactly what the title indicates and more. The action, blood letting and witty dialogue never stop in this violent but funny superhero-on-steriod film starring Nicolas Cage (Big Daddy), Mark Strong (Kick-Ass) and the real star Chloe Moretz (Hit Girl). With great performances from Cage and Moretz trashing the bad guys has never been more fun. It's definitely not the brand of superheroes and caped crusaders I grew up with but once I got over the initial shock I was good to go!<br /><br />You might want to keep small children from viewing this one, at least until you've seen it yourself and are able to make an informed decision. In the meantime I'm ready to watch it again!</p></body></html>

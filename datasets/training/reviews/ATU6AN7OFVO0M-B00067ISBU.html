<meta name="summary" content="Step into the new age of DVD production with this DVD set!"></head><body><p>I didn't like the movie honestly! of course it had some strong points. one of the most important prominences of this movie was the right and enoght imagination. they didn't bring us something unique at the price of sacrificing the impression of the film. It's a tradition in these days movies that they want to depict new versions of well known monsters and heroes and the consequences most of the times will be ridiculous and critical phenomenons! Fortunately I saw one of the best remakes of comic heroes in this movie! Hellboy was astonishingly brilliant and realistic. Visuals and CGs of this movie were excellent and looked realistic too. The only critical and unsophisticated character of the movie was "The Corpse"! the reason that I didn't like this movie was it's scenario. I think it's not dynamic enough. It's good and reasonable but it's not dynamic. there is not a jaw dropping action scene that makes you screen or jump out of your sit and there is not a hanging story that encourage you to watch it till the end. they tried to bring us both action and mystery. and they didn't succeed in both, specially the mystery! I can't give this movie more than 3 stars. but It's a 5 star DVD set!<br /><br />This DVDs design is a masterpiese! you'll get all you want, synchronized and real time! this is not the begining of new type of DVD production. I've seen such thing before in New Line Infinifilm series but, the job they've done here, is the peak of it! and made this DVD set a matter of hours and even days of entertainment! I admire them for the brilliant and revolutionary DVD release and I bought this movie only for the DVD options.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bad sequel, but a very honest SF/action movie, with an amazing performance by Sanaa Lathan!"></head><body><p>I was myself surprised by how much I actually liked AVP, considering that it is very inferior to the founding films in both franchises and also to the Dark Horse original "Aliens vs. Predator" comics.<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind, that this film plays in an ENTIRELY different (lower) league than "Alien", "Predator" and "Aliens". To my personal taste it is also mostly on the same level of quality as "Alien3" and "Predator 2". On another hand it is definitely better than "AVP 2", "Alien Resurrection" and "Predators".<br /><br />The possible future fusion of both franchises was first announced on the screen in "Predator 2" in 1990, in a short glimpse on the trophies wall in Predator's ship - amongst other memories of succesful hunts we could admire one huge adult xenomorph's (adult form of Alien creature) head. This promise was further confirmed in 1991 by the extraordinary Dark Horse comics "Aliens vs. Predator", which was in part an inspiration for AVP. "Aliens vs. Predators" comics met a considerable success in the following years, although none of them ever came even close to the quality of the first one.<br /><br />It took however 13 years to produce a film in which both Aliens and Predators are present and this long wait didn't help the whole enterprise. The scenario adopted for this film was clearly not the best of solutions. Placing the action of AVP in Antarctica in present times broke the logics of both franchises. The aura of awe and horror surrounding the Aliens was in part created by the fact that they were a complete novelty for humanity - a completely new form of existence, absolutely unfamiliar, unheard off, in one word ALIEN. Placing them on Earth quite regularly since prehistoric times and suggest that images of some of the monsters in ancient temples were in fact traces of their presence on our planet, all of that ripped in shreds this particular shroud of terror in which they were wrapped. Also, putting Predators in Antarctica, was ludicrous, as it was stressed otherwise in both movies, that they are partial to heat and hunt on Earth only in the hottest spots, during the hottest summers...<br /><br />All of that was already a HUGE mistake, but giving up on the best parts of the original comics was even worse! Replacing the character of Machiko Noguchi (colonial administrator of a distant planet) by Alexa Woods (guide for high mountain and polar expeditions) was a rather bad idea, but it had also its good points, for reasons which I will explain later. But changing the ending was a DEADLY SIN.<br /><br />I can not go into details, in case if you didn't yet see the film or read the comics, but let's just be said that the final fate of Machiko Noguchi in the original comics is one of the best ideas I have seen in the whole SF - and it opens the gate to infinite possibilities for sequels full of wonderful adventures. But AVP closed this gate so thoroughly that I think the producer, the director and the scenarist simply CHICKENED OUT after seeing the sheer scale of future possibilities. I can not say anything more - read the comics and see the film and judge by yourself.<br /><br />That being said, if we forget for a moment that AVP was supposed to be part of BOTH great franchises, it is not such a bad "stand alone" SF film and ultimately I rather liked it, for reasons which I will enumarate below, with limited SPOILERS:<br /><br />1. Antarctica. This place of action gives to AVP a quite unique atmosphere, to such extent, that it is easy to forget that we are on our planet... The abandoned "village", where once whalers dwelled and worked, inspired clearly by the real life "ghost town" of Grytviken, is particularly well made.<br /><br />2. The Great Pyramid of Predators. That gigantic structure is really well done and contributes a lot to the oppressive atmosphere dominating in the film. And the deadly surprises hidden in its mechanisms are also quite impressive.<br /><br />3. Alien vs. Predator fights - VERY well done! The duel between "Grid" (a particularly big Alien "soldier") and one of the young Predators is actually the ONE scene which is as good as anything from "Aliens" or the first "Predator".<br /><br />4. Lance Henriksen. It is a real pleasure to watch this actor in any movie in which he appears - and here, as Charles Bishop Weyland, the founder and CEO of Weyland Industries (which later, after a merger will become the infamous Weyland-Yutani), he is as good as Bishop the android in "Aliens"<br /><br />5. "Scar" Predator. The most gifted of the three young Predators who appear in the film is a very impressive creature and an imposing presence on the screen, quite a lot like the principal Predator in "Aliens vs. Predators" comics.<br /><br />6. Last but not least, Sanaa Lathan. Cast as Alexa Woods, the principal character, she is the MAIN reason why I liked this film so much. Although her character was clearly inspired by Machiko Noguchi from the comics, Alexa is different, but definitely not one bit less interesting. Making her living by guiding expeditions in Himalayas, Arctic and Antarctica, respected in her profession, confident in her abilities and financially independent, she is completely in charge of her destiny and is definitely no damsel in distress. But, although very tough when needed, she is also a very feminine and warm person - and thanks to Sanaa Latham unique charm, this character is also very beautful and sexy...<br /><br />Also, what I liked very much in Alexa Woods is the calm, the self-control, a great dignity, all mixed with modest and gentle behaviour. When she needs to take charge, Alexa rules with an iron fist - but wrapped in a soft silk glove... Finally, she is also a lady, in the best meaning of this word - it takes two hours of all hell breaking lose and a hurricane of violence, death and suffering to finally force her to raise her voice and shout one obscenity!<br /><br />And then, there are also scenes, in which Alexa meets one of the Predators face to face. Sanaa Latham played in those moments PERFECTLY! I believe that I have never seen in the cinema a more intense and more interesting meeting and interaction between a human and an alien intelligent creature. The scene in which Alexa receives a "gift" (well, sort of...) is particularly strong - and her acceptance of it is... well, no. I am not saying anything more - if you didn't see this film, you desserve to discover it by yourself.<br />---<br />CONCLUSION: if one manages to forget that this film is supposed to be a sequel in two franchises and succeeds to no less than three MASTERPIECES ("Alien", "Aliens" and "Predator"), AVP is a quite good SF movie, visually stunning and well interpreted. I simply can not help it - I LIKE IT!</p></body></html>

Jaws is a movie that no one will ever forget. For a 1975 movie, Jaws still remains a classic. What a great movie for the decade. As many times as I've seen Jaws, if I see it playing on t.v., I can't help but watch it again. Great acting, great special effects, great writing, great everything. There are not many movies that people talk about 31 years later, but Jaws is one of them! There are sequels to this classic but none of them can beat the original Jaws....... the movie that made you scared to go into the water!!! Excellent movie!!!!</p></body></html>

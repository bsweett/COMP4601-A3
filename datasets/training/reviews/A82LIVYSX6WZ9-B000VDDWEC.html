<meta name="summary" content="28 Days Later is a clever, original movie thats delivers"></head><body><p>Cillian Murphy (Intermission, upcoming Batman Begins) plays Jack, an ordinary man who wakes up one morning in the hospital and finds out that the world around him is barrin and empty, though he encounters strange people who look like they took too much drugs and have beat red eyes. Soon, he is saved by 2 people who tell him about the deadly rage outbreak thats infecting all of the areas around them. When one of the crew gets bit, they leave and find a man and his child locked up in a abandoned apartment complex. Soon, all 4 journey out again to go towards where the military said they'd be and they make it but they lose another member, so Jack, the woman and the girl named Hannah are at the safe house or mansion, led by a nasty Christopher Eccleston (Shallow Grave, Jude). He says the message they sent was to woe in any women because the men he is in charge with are going crazy without it....so, Jack, the woman and Hannah are stuck inside the mansion with the insane soldiers and outside are the zombie like infected people. A completely good original movie with fun and clever and horror ideas that make and glue the whole story together.....you know, just think...what would you do if that happened to your hometown...you'd panic like hell and run very fast. A winner in my book. Also starring Brenden Gleeson (Tailor Of Panama, Dark Blue)</p></body></html>

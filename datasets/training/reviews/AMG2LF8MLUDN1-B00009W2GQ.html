<meta name="summary" content="A New Era for Scifi"></head><body><p>For those of you who ask for comparisons between Star Wars and the Matrix series, the answer is a very simple one.  There ain't none!  It would be like comparing apples to potatoes.  It just doesn't work.  What we have in the Matrix Trilogy is a new benchmark in the scifi world.  There has never been anything like it.  As with an artichoke, one must peel back each layer because there are many.  It requires the viewer to watch it more than once or even twice.  The Matrix requires some actual thought unlike other films that do the thinking for you.  Everything is on the screen.  No need to think.  The average moviegoer has become lazy.  When a picture like this comes along we don't understand it.  It appears not to make sense, hence we don't understand what we're seeing.  Hence the bad reviews that many folks have dished out.  We don't want to work for our entertainment.  We just want to take the "blue pill" and be told that we are being entertained.<br /><br />It is for this reason that I emplore you not only to view the Matrix Trilogy for the first time but many times after that.  As I have stated in my reviews of The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded, I too have had to watch it more than twice because I didn't think much of them at first viewing.  But having seen them all many times over now I have turned into the biggest Matrix fan I know.  There are those of you who know nothing about computers and you may surely become confused but not to worry.  Just find the nearest computer geek and he/she will explain all.<br /><br />There are those out there that have practically turned this trilogy into a religion all on it's own.  I dare say, you need not go that far.  There are elements in the film that correlate with the story of Jesus and the Wachowski brothers state that this was intentional.  I don't know what the rationale was behind that decision but whatever it was, it clicks with the audiences.  Pastors are breaking the film down and showing pieces of it to their congregations, philosophers debate it and the great thinkers of our time are expressing their views about meaning behind The Matrix.<br /><br />(Beware of Spoilers below)<br /><br />This movie concludes the trilogy with the death of Trinity and Neo and the end of the war between man and machine.  The Oracle told Neo that he or Morpheus would die in the first film.  And so it came to pass.  Neo so loved Trinity that he could not imagine life without her.  That is one of the reasons  why he fought so hard against the machine world.  He could not be separated from her.  With her death however, he was now able to sacrifice himself for Zion.  Perhaps he did not even want to live without her.  It just so happened that the plan he and the oracle had would benefit Zion so perhaps his death was not as self-sacrificing as it appeared to be.  What would he have done if  Trinity had lived?<br /><br />While this film does mimic the story of Jesus it also (I'm sorry to say) mocks Him at the same time.  His name is constantly used in vain as a swear word.  Unfortunately, it does bother those of us who worship the Lord.  It could send mixed messages to those who are not spiritually educated in these matters but that's why Christians should view this film.  It's our job to point out certain items and educate.  It's very important to use the vehicles that we can use to minister.  Many people will not see the Jesus story here because they don't know it.<br /><br />The basic concept of The Matrix is so new that it boggles the mind.  Humans being cultivated and used as an alternative source of power for a machine world.  Some humans want freedom and others are content to remain in the matrix.  Those who fight the matrix await the coming of a savior (foretold by Morpheus-a John the Baptist sort of character) who has the ability to save them.  Imagine that your life and all that you knew was only a dreamworld that the matrix cooked up for you.  In reality you are being kept in a vat of liquid, connected to cables, unable to speak or see, suppling the machine world with the power it needs to exist.  Humans are no longer born but grown by the machines.  Brilliant concept!  I'm surprised that no one thought of it sooner in this age of the computer. The Matrix is almost like a living super hero comic for adults.<br /><br />Please give this trilogy a chance.  This is the movie that all future scifi will be measured against.  If you miss it then you'll wonder where all the new scifi came from.  Just as Star Wars broke ground in it's day, now we have The Matrix which has broken new ground.  No matter what comes next in the Star Wars saga, Star Wars is dead.  Long live The Matrix!!!</p></body></html>

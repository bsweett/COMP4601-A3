<meta name="summary" content="Call me a sap, but this is genuine hollywood magic"></head><body><p>I have watched this movie many times, and each time it makes me cry and feel overwhelmed with emotion.  This amazes me, because it is so sentimental and in many ways contrived, at least as we see it through our jaded modern eyes.  Sure, it was made for a simpler time, but there is no doubt that it taps into universal human truths and hopes.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart is wonderful as a good and talented man who allows his sense of responsibility to guide his life, which costs him hugely in his sense of frustration and thwarted ambition.  You see it in him as a child, particularly the scene in the drug store, where he saves more than one life.  (That scene chokes me up every time I see it.  There is such struggle and caring in it, such courage as he sticks to his decision.  It is one of the most powerful scenes I have ever seen in the cinema.)  Of course, he has a terrible crisis that is resolved, with a renewed sense of life.<br /><br />Donna Reed is also wonderful as his wife, a simple woman who loves him in the way we would all hope to be loved in marriage.  Indeed, she embodies an ideal and yet is so believable that it makes me introspect on my own marriage.  And Barrymore!  The perfect capitalist ogre.<br /><br />Like many, I watch this every Christmas season and feel awe at the power of a perfectly crafted hollywood story.  While we get down on hollywood formulas, there are times when it works as well as one could hope.  That is this film, one of the finest ever made.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.</p></body></html>

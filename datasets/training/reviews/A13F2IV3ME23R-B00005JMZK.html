<meta name="summary" content="DEFINITELY AN 8 PLUS"></head><body><p>After watching the extended version and both commentaries [which gives an insight to what it takes to make such a movie]<br /><br />It is hard to take comic book characters come alive with any great success but this is the best ever with regards to any type of alien.<br /><br />I was glad to see Lance Henricksen back [the forrunner of Bishop]and my Predator was great.  All the actors fit the parts they were playing with great success.  The execution of the difficult shots were fabulous.<br /><br />Hang in there guys - you did a great job [great entertainment]<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ------- DEFINITELY A KEEPER!</p></body></html>

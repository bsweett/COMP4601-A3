<meta name="summary" content="The Warm World of Loveable Losers"></head><body><p>Little Miss Sunshine is a dysfunctional family drama that follows the trials and tribulations of six family members as they trek cross-country in their crumbling VW bus in an attempt to get the youngest, Olive, to a Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California.<br /><br />Perhaps the most endearing thing about Little Miss Sunshine isn't it's intimate look inside the slightly twisted hearts of its six main characters.  It isn't the off-kilter comedy of its road-trip plot.  It isn't even the almost flawless acting of young Abigail Breslin as Olive, the precocious young girl with dreams of being a beauty pageant winner.<br /><br />No, what makes this movie truly unique is how it takes what could be a rote plot contrivance (Will she win the pageant?) and turns it on its head (SHOULD she win the pageant?).  By the time the family reaches the end of their difficult journey (having endured mechanical failures, an uncomfortably close experience with death, and even the saving grace of pornographic magazines) they are moving on auto-pilot, doggedly moving ahead simply because that has been their purpose.  When they reach the pageant, though, instead of a moving moment of self-redemption, it serves as a grotesque reminder that sometimes dreams are less important than the reasons those dreams exist in the first place.<br /><br />This movie is, after all, about people who have failed.  Greg Kinnear plays with exquisite desperation the patriarch, Richard, a failed motivational speaker (and, no, the irony isn't lost on him).  Dwayne is a typically-rebellious young teen who follows the teachings of Nietzsche and has sworn to a vow of silence until he achieves his goal of becoming an Air Force fighter pilot.  Alan Arkin is the foul-mouthed, drug-addicted grandfather, searching for his own version of contentment in his life's twilight years.  Toni Collette is absolutely perfect as the mother, Sheryl, who has made this frazzled family the locus of her own frazzled life.  And Steve Carell shines, cast against type as the once-eminent Proust scholar, Frank, who is attempting to recover after losing his lover, his job, and his will to keep on living.<br /><br />Given such a cast of characters, it would be easy to see it devolving (even with the talent at hand) into something melodramatic and cheesy, but this movie operates with a light touch.  Never does the film indulge in the kind of shameless self-congratulatory lesson-learning that dysfunctional family comedies are so rife with these days.  We are treated, instead, to a tender and yet unflinching look at these people and how they struggle.  This is, quite obviously, a family of losers (in whatever way you want to define that word), but -- as we are shown in the final scenes -- in a world that is sickeningly obsessed with winning, being a loser is nothing to be ashamed of.</p></body></html>

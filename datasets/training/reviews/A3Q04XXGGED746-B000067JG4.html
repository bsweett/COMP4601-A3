Who could forget the scene where the father says, "You delivered your message. Now get out of here!" to the guy (the future boyfriend of his daughter) who has just given the Heil [...] salute? Or the scene where the father tears down the German [...] flag soon after the Anschluss? The music is always lively and upbeat, especially for such a sad and tragic time in history.</p></body></html>

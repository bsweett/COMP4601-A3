It had a good cast with Kevin Costner and Demi Moore in lead roles and a wonderful co-starring role for William Hurt as the alter ego to Mr Brooks.  In fact, the film started well but thereafter fell apart.<br /><br />My major criticism of the film is that it just became plain implausible and far too contrived.  Perhaps many people are credulous and just accepted the plot.  I couldn't manage this part.  By the time the film ended, I felt relieved.  Murder had been heaped upon murder with each twist of the plot becoming increasingly unrealistic.<br /><br />Overall, given the quality of the cast, this film left me feeling cheated.  Potentially, it had much to offer but, in the end, delivered little.</p></body></html>

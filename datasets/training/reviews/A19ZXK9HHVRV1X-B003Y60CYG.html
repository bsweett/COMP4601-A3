Created and hosted by Keillor, the show, as its title suggests, offers a folksy blend of country music, humorous anecdotes, live commercial spots and generous helpings of homespun wisdom.<br /><br />For the movie, Altman and Keillor chose not to go with the actual PHC cast (with the notable exception of Keillor himself), but to hire big name movie stars - Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, Lindsay Lohan et. al. - to do the on-stage performing as well as enact the fictionalized drama taking place backstage.  It is in the drama that the movie runs into its greatest trouble.  Needing some sort of narrative hook on which to hang the otherwise disconnected musical sequences, the filmmakers have come up with the stale device of a big bad business tycoon from Texas (Tommy Lee Jones) buying the station and threatening to shut down the program which he sees merely as a quaint little relic from a bygone era.  In a bizarre foray into the supernatural, the movie also has the angel of death in a white trench coat (Virginia Madsen) gliding around the theater uttering enigmatic comments on the meaning of life as she zeroes in on her latest scheduled "victim."<br /><br />Since Altman was seriously ill at the time of filming (this turned out to be his final movie), we can understand why so much of the film deals with the issues of death and the melancholic passage of time.  But what we can't understand is how he managed to turn "A Prairie Home Companion" into such a lifeless and uninvolving movie.  One wonders how the show itself would have been able to stay on the air for as long as it has if it were really as desultory, enervating and dour as it appears to be here.  Even the live audience can't seem to muster up much enthusiasm for what's taking place on stage.  The least Altman could have done is include some shots of the audience to create at least some sense of interaction between the fans and the performers and gin up some excitement.  Instead, the people remain shrouded in darkness, with only some occasional applause or muted laughter to remind us that they're even there.  The movie is far too lackluster and passive in its approach to the subject, lacking the energy, passion and dynamism one would reasonably expect from a movie centered, as this one is, on live musical performing (watch "A Hard Day`s Night" and "A Mighty Wind" to see how it can and should be done).<br /><br />The musicianship and singing are unobjectionable and decent, if not exactly foot-stomping or rousing, yet even they fail to rouse us out of the lethargy we've been lulled into by the dull behind-the-scenes drama that somehow passes for a "storyline" in the film.  There are some occasionally funny moments along the way - Kevin Kline scores as an anachronistic security guard straight out of a bad film noir mystery, and Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly have some fun as two singing cowpokes whose risqu&eacute; lyrics offend the producer far more than they do the audience - but there's a definite air of desperation about the project, as if the people who came up with the idea just couldn't find any way to really make it work as a film.  There are lots of nice little "bits" floating around inside "A Prairie Home Companion," but the filmmakers never manage to bring them all together into a movie that really matters much.<br /><br />The tone of sadness that permeates the film makes it more effective as a valedictory for the late director than as a fitting tribute to the goal and spirit of the original "Prairie Home Companion."</p></body></html>

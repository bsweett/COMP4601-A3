After seeing it 3 times, I now realize it's a brilliant work and one of the all time classics for a drama.  The performances are just unbelievable.  All of the actors completely immersed themselves into their roles.  This type of passion is rarely seen in today's cinema.  Paul thomas anderson captured magic in a bottle and Magnolia lives on as a documantation of brilliant cinema. It is story driven and character driven and it is why Paul Thomas Anderson in my oppinion is one of the best directors and writers in Hollywood.</p></body></html>

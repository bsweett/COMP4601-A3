BOURNE SUPREMACY (Universal) follows hard on the heels 2002's "Bourne Identity" and does not disappoint.<br /><br />Matt Damon secured action star status as Jason Bourne.  In "Identity," the amnesiac CIA agent discovers who he is.  In "Supremacy," he discovers what he is.  Director Paul Greengrass does not let up in the forward motion of the relentlessly face-paced story when Bourne, seeking some kind of redemption for the unwanted killer identity he has discovered about himself, is framed for murder in Berlin.<br /><br />A surfeit of cool extras include better than average documentaries on the casting, photography and action sequences (car chases, fight scenes and explosions).  The startling deleted scenes are worth checking out and actually add something to the film. The informative commentary from Greengrass is actually worth listening to.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent 'popcorn' movie"></head><body><p>Honestly, I don't remember enough about the first "Terminator" movie or its sequel to know how logically "Terminator 3" Rise of the Machines" relates to them. I decided it didn't matter because the basic premise is itself illogical and because so many years separate the making of each installment that each has to stand on its own. If there is any parallel between the real world and "Terminator" world, it might be this: By the time "T3" was produced, nearly all the special effects could be computer generated. This technology has gotten so good that the line between `real' and `unreal' images is quite blurred. What all our real life machines can do in the future is both exciting and frightening.<p>"T3" takes place just before a super-computer tries to unleash a nuclear holocaust that will allow machines to defeat human beings. T-X [Kristanna Loken], a `female' killer robot, comes from the future to eliminate a twentysomething John Connor [Nick Stahl] and all those who might join him the resistance to come. Close on her heels is Terminator [Arnold Schwarzenegger], whose mission it is to save Connor and his future wife, Kate [Claire Danes]. There are problems for Terminator such as his being an older model than T-X. [Arnold is himself now in his mid-fifties.] There is the sullen, stubborn Connor, who has already been through so much that he doesn't have a clue as to how to lead a revolution. And, of course, when Connor and Kate meet, they don't much like each other. So, what makes them think they will ever marry?<p>There is lots of action here; in fact, the movie could be called one long chase sequence. To me, the chases were well paced and exhilarating. Long is a relative term.<p>Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are two exceptional young actors. Their presence helped make the movie for me. Both seemed to center the movie by giving it interesting performances. It can be argued, however, that they are too good to be in a movie like this. Neither are typical action/adventure types. <p>Overall, "T3" is one of the best `popcorn' movies of recent times</p></body></html>

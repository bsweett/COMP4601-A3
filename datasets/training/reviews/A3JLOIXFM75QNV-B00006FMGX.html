<meta name="summary" content="A fun, great paced film"></head><body><p>I am not a Tom Hanks fan but I adore Leonardo Dicaprio. He is a wonderful actor and brilliant in everything he does. And this is one of my most favorite roles of his. Its perfect and entertaining. I couldn't believe it was actually based on a factual event. Its amazing to even think about while watching this film. The movie is actually a bit long, however, I barely felt it because there really is no down time or boring parts. It is a great chase like movie. Really captivating.</p></body></html>

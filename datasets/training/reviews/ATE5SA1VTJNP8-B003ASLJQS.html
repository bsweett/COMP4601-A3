A million movies with a redemption theme have been made, what make Mystic River stand out is its candidness when dealing with the human condition.<br /><br />Abducted at a young age while playing street hockey with his buddies, Dave (Robbins)ends up escaping, and we then see him as an adult- a husband and father. When Dave comes home late one night from the bar, his wife finds him with blood stains, he claims that he was mugged, and that he fought with the mugger. That same night, Dave's niece (Penn's daughter) was murdered. And so the mystery begins. While unraveling this mystery, the three childhood friends find themselves involved in this. I will not say any more regarding the plot, but want to emphasize the extraordinary job done in developing the characters, and presenting the viewer with angles that are seldom thought of.<br /><br />Well-done!</p></body></html>

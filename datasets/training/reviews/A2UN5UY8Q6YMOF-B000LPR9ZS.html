<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining, but gory"></head><body><p>I've seen all the Saw movies and this one is much like the first 2, but with more gore and less suspense or mystery.  So I would have to say this was the least interesting of the three.  But the movie provides closure, I just hope they don't make another-not sure what is left to tell.  This was the first Blu Ray disc I watched on my PS3.  I also own the Toshiba A1 HD DVD player so I've seen a lot of high def movies.  As with most high def movies, the picture was very sharp and saturated in brighter scenes.  In darker scenes, the picture was more noisy and looked like regular DVD.  But I have seen this on all high def movies so I don't think Saw 3 was a bad transfer.  If you liked the first 2, then you'll probably like this one too.</p></body></html>

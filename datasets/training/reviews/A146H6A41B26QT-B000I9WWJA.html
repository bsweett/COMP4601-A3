<meta name="summary" content="Great!"></head><body><p>This tightly crafted thriller directed by Spike Lee kept my husband and me enthralled from beginning to end. Denzel Washington is one of my favorites, and here he plays a slightly scruffy, smart, wisecracking detective. He gets off a few great one-liners--in trying to calm down an irate Sikh whose turban is removed by police and screams and yells about discrimination, Washington says "I bet you don't have trouble getting a cab in NYC." A bank is robbed and the burglars disappear--he's just smart enough to be puzzled, rather than simply frustrated.<br /><br />Jodie Foster is marvelous as a shadowy "fixer" of problems--who exactly is she?--we never really know. Clive Owen is the brains behind the operation--and a clever one it is.<br /><br />We only begin to see what must have happened in the last scene or two--the burglars have high motives, and the real "bad guy" is nailed. We left the theatre with heads spinning, only then understanding the clues that had been left along the way. I suppose there were holes--but not so many as to mar this thoroughly enjoyable film.</p></body></html>

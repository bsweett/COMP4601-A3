<meta name="summary" content=""Sometimes you have to kill a whole lot of people.""></head><body><p>Sin City is the first movie of 2005 to actually get excited about; it follows the source material 99.9%(which is astounding for it's extremely violent content).  I've heard comparisons  ranging from Pulp Fiction to Star Wars but really the film stands all on its own.  An amazing and altogether unique moviegoing experience that reawakens us to the incredible possibilities of film.<br /><br />I'm not surprised that we have Robert Rodriguez (and of course, Frank Miller) to thank for this.  The guy knows how to make movies like no other.  I was impressed with Guillermo Del Toro's fanboy fueled Hellboy last year and with Sin City we get an equally impressive and awe inspiring realization of an underground comic brought vividly, and brutally, to life.<br /><br />Sin City is comprised of three books, The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard.  I could almost swear that for some minor deviances due to film constraints and the insecurities of Jessica Alba (really, it wouldn't have killed you to be topless as Nancy the stripper for cryin' outloud!) the movie is a frame for frame reenactment of the comics.  It helps to have read the books first, just to fully understand what is being done.<br /><br />In 1990 Warren Beatty did a superb job of bringing Dick Tracy to the screen and now, in 2005 we have Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller wholly deserving of praise for their new noir masterpiece.  It's visceral, it's raw, and it's entertaining from start to finish.<br /><br />The casting is top notch, Bruce Willis as Hartigan; the truly underappreciated Mickey Rourke as Marv; Clive Owen, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Nick Stahl, Brittany Murphy, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe-they all do fine jobs.  But it's Benicio Del Toro who has the standout part as Jackie Boy.  He's funny, vicious, and unsettling all at the same time.<br /><br />If you're looking for hard boiled, white knuckle action with insane violence (we're talking gleeful overkill here) look no further than Sin City.  The first must see movie of 2005 and a beacon of hope for the future of film.  I'm hoping this makes a killing at the ol' box office because there are more Sin City books ready and waiting for the big screen.</p></body></html>

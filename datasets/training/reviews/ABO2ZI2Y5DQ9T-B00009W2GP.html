<meta name="summary" content="Tired Sequel with Few Redeeming Points"></head><body><p>The (hoprefully) last entry of the 'Matrix' trilogy should be remembered by a single fact -- that is, it was released on the same day worldwide on November 5th, 2003 -- in USA, Russia, India, Japan, Iceland, etc.  Think about the reason behind that; think about the internet, which would spread the viewers' comments about the film all over the world.  One thing Joel Silver did right is the decision about the release date, for without that, people would be informed how awful this 'Revolutions' was.<br /><br />The story starts again where the 'Reloaded' ended.  And what comes then after that first sequel, which suggested many mysteries and plots going on?  Nothing memorable.  Keanu's Neo is trapped somewhere, a certain place like a subway station, where 'The Trainman' appears.  What does HE do?  Nothing.  What does Neo do to escape from there?  Nothing.  What does Monica Bellucci do in this new sequel?  Nothing (except for saying a line or two, I guess). The fate of Trinity and Neo?  Well, both look as if they lost interest in the film itself.  And someone please tell me, who was that guy with French accent?<br /><br />Well, I am not exaggerating, and the things go on and on in this way.  Yes, the city of Zion, the key element which should be one of the culminating points of the film, is in danger, threatened by the armies of lethal machines.  OK, but most of the main characters are removed from the scene, so we experience less emotions about the fatal battle, which should be more 'life-or-death' matter to the characters.<br /><br />The battle between Neo and Agent Smith is tedious, not because of the CGIs, but exactly because those CGIs.  In the original, we are impressed with the fact that Keanu Reeves could do the kung-hu fighting; here, we are supposed to be impressed with Neo flying in the air, or lots (yes, lots) of sneering Agent Smiths.  The ho-hum effects end up with the repetitious fights that seems to refuse to end.<br /><br />Not everything is bad, I admit.  The battle of the City of Zion is certainly gripping (though too long).  Jada Pinkett Smith gives terrific acting.  But what I could remember is only this -- the tame, cop-out ending, which suggests more sequels to come.<br /><br />'The Matrix Revolutions' is a good proof that there are limits for creative energy for any humans, even if you spent as much money as possible.  Sorry if I sound cruel, but that's the truth.</p></body></html>

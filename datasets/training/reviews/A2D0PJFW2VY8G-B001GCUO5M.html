<meta name="summary" content="Effective but predictable thriller"></head><body><p>Martin Scorsese's 2010 collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio is a mystery thriller boasting an impressive cast with the likes of Mark Ruffalo and Sir Ben Kingsley supporting DiCaprio who takes the lead role. Scorsese immortalised himself in film history for me with the flawless Goodfellas (1990). The question was could he reclaim that same Midas touch with Shutter Island?<br /><br />Set in 1954, DiCaprio takes on the role of Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshal who is sent to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patient from the Ashecliffe Hospital. Joined by his partner, Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), Teddy soon finds himself on the trail of Rachel Solando, the missing patient that came to the hospital after drowning her three children. What begins as a seemingly straightforward assignment becomes a fierce power struggle as Teddy and Chuck's efforts to find Rachel are frequently hindered by the evasive hospital staff with short memories, while Dr John Cawley (Ben Kingsley) seems to be at the head of a strange cover-up, but what are they all hiding?<br /><br />Shutter Island begins quickly with the opening scene showing Teddy and Chuck on a boat bound for the island. They're soon beginning their investigation and we gain insight into Teddy through a series of flashbacks of his time in the Second World War. The background to what he witnessed is slowly introduced but it's clear from the start that Teddy carries demons with him. Such constraints are not eased by the difficult hospital staff who reveal some information about the missing Rachel Solando but not enough for Teddy and Chuck to scratch beneath the surface. The insistence that Rachel somehow escaped from a locked room seems implausible but no one is talking and the frustration soon begins to build.<br /><br />As Teddy's investigation progresses it soon becomes clear that something is amiss on Shutter Island beyond the reluctance of any of the staff to say anything about Rachel Solando. Unfortunately, about an hour into the film I had speculated with Mrs B about what was going on and I'm disappointed to say that between us we sussed out the story well before the end! The failing I think was in too much information being revealed too soon. Seeing Teddy's flashbacks, beginning with the Second World War then moving onto his family, began with much intrigue but many will be able to hazard a guess at the twist to the story, which is good but too predictable.<br /><br />The film does boast an impressive setting on the island and the autumnal feel of the surroundings adds to the overall mystery. DiCaprio acquits himself well as the leading man while Mark Ruffalo, Sir Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow provide good support. The performances do not hinder the film which progresses well for the first hour but as soon as my speculation about the film's inevitable twist started to unfold I found myself disappointed. That said, Shutter Island does have one final shock to deliver and I'll hold my hands up and say I didn't see this one coming and it did help round the film off nicely.<br /><br />Shutter Island is an effective thriller with the isolated setting adding to the unease of the environment as soon as Teddy and Chuck set foot on shore. While the film maintains the interest for a while, the premature revelations of key aspects of the plot give the game away too soon. This is still worth watching especially as the final scene is much more difficult to predict than the core of the film's story.</p></body></html>

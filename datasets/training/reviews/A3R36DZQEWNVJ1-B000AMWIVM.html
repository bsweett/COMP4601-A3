<meta name="summary" content="Saw delivers the goods with a killer ending"></head><body><p>Two men wake up in a scuzzy and awful looking bathroom with chains and ankle bracelets on them attached to pipes. They dont know why they are there until they find 2 tapes and a recorder on a dead guy in the middle of the room. So, there's a sadistic loony killer called The Jigsaw Killer out there who loves to play games with his victims and has them play in dangerous scenarios involving barbwire, bear traps and fire. Soon. Doctor Gordon, played by Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride, Robin Hood Men In Tights) and the other man Adam, played by Leigh Whannell (Razor Eaters, Matrix Reloaded) ,find out why they are there....they find 2 saws and to get out they  cant saw threw the chains, but their legs to get loose. In the same vein as SEVEN. Who doesnt want to see Cary Elwes, Westley from Princess Bride, saw his foot off? That scene of superbly done, the music was just right and the ending was what got me...totally didnt see that coming. Also starring Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon movies), Tobin Bell (Black Mask 2, The Firm) Monica Potter (Tv's Boston Legal, Con Air), Benito Martinez (Tv's The Shield), Shawnee Smith (Saw 2, Tvs Becker), Dina Meyer (Saw 2, Starship Troopers) and Ken Leung (Rush Hour, Keeping The Faith). Dina Meyer and Shawnee Smith also star in Saw 2 as the same characters...Tobin Bell as well too</p></body></html>

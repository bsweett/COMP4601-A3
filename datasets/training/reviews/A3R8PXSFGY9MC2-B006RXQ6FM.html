<meta name="summary" content="Doubt"></head><body><p>`Doubt' is an outstanding film with exemplary performances from both Meryl Streep and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. They both lift this film from being standard fare to being something great and with gravitas. Hoffman is a progressive priest and Streep is a puritanical nun who is desperate to see any bad in him so that she can hound him out of the church school and maintain her austere status quo. She then starts to have suspicions of inappropriate behaviour with the children, which in reality may just be an informal personality and a man in touch with his gentler side, and yet she is so certain of her suspicions that you are left doubting his behaviour by the end as well. The direction and acting is excellent and although the story could have been resolved more fully, it gave you enough to become fully involved in the plot. In fact, it may have deliberately left the ending slightly ambiguous so that you feel the doubt that other characters also feel and if that was the intention it was a masterly cinematic trick. This has top performances from the main cast and an engaging plot and is well worth watching at some point. Even for those of us who are fatigued with seeing yet another catholic scandal film, this is so well portrayed that it is worth viewing anyway.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

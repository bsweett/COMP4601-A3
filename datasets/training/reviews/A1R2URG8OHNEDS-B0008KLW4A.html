This is one mess of a movie, and I sensed it from the ads, but since I give everything the benefit of the doubt, I had to go check it out. Halle Berry gives one of the worst performance ever, but she was never that great of an actress anyway. I never saw the preformance that she won an Oscar for, "Monsters Ball," but anything has to be better than this. Sharon Stone was awful as well, and Benjamin Bratt, who was never really that good anyway. The script was so weak, with awful lines, horrible situations, and of course, cliche's galore. There was a scene where Berry and Bratt was at a county fair, on a ferris wheel, and there is an electrical breakdown, and somebody almost falls off the wheel, but it's Catwomen to the rescue. There was another classic Berry/Bratt scene where they were playing basketball, and she used all of her new cat skills and cat powers to beat him. Throughout the entire movie there is a sexual undertone, and even when her character and Bratt's character "make love" he does wake up with a scratch on his back. It's actually pretty lame, but briefly funny. I also couldn't understand if Catwomen was supposed to be bad or not. I know that Sharon Stone's character was bad, but Catwomen fights her, which is the good side, but then she robs a jewerly store, which was her bad side. There was so coherent background to the character, and the movie feels like it was made in about eight seconds.<br /><br />The movie actually starts with opening credits, which actually steals the little attention that you would want to have while watching this film. Halle Berry plays Patience Phillips, a young women who has too much patience to put up with all of the people at work. She works at Hedare Beauty, with her friend Sally, and always puts up with her boss George. His wife, Laurel, the face of the business, is going to retire, just as the company is releasing a new product that will reverse aging. The product does have a side effect, a terrible awful horrible one, and Patience ends up seeing the meeting that discusses it. She runs away, but ends up drowning in the ocean, or a lake, I can't remember. But, cats end up resurrecting her, because of Egyptian Mau, who used to hang out in old temples, but has been found around Patiences apartment. There is even a scene where she tries to stop it from jumping off a ledge, and a cop thinks that she was going to kill herself. Enter Tom, who is a cop. When Patience wakes up, her eyes go from the human pattern to the cat pattern, which was one of the lamest special effects I could think of. Patience doesn't remember anything, so she sets out to find out who killed her. She becomes Catwomen, with the slick, letal, sex like, whipping attire, but is then framed for murder. Tom begins to persue Patience, but then things begin to connect, and he could find out who Catwomen really is. . .<br /><br />There was no point in "Catwomen" being made. It has to be the worst superhero movie I have ever seen, and I didn't even know if she was supposed to be a hero or not. I could think of so many things wrong with it, that I can't even praise it. There was a scene where, before Patience discovers that she has powers, she is walking with her friend, and they pass a women walking her dog, and the dog barks at her, and she hisses. It was supposed to be funny, but it was just funny because it was so awful. You end up not caring what happens to anyone, because nobody is likeable enough to care. Tom is always right around the corner to make sure nothing is wrong, and Laurel is so bad that she is always waiting for Catwomen to arrive. It's hard to write a review where there is nothing to say that is good about a movie, because it's so one directional, so I'll sum it all up in a single sentence. With lame special effects, a hack script, and terrible acting and direction, I have to call "Catwomen" one of the worst movies of the year--after "The Girl Next Door," of course. I didn't like it, but you might.<br /><br />ENJOY!<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for action violence and some sensuality.</p></body></html>

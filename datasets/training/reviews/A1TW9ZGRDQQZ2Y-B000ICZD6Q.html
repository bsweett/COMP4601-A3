I thought going in that it would be mildly entertaining, but by the time the credits began to roll I didn't want to leave these characters I have come to know over the last two hours. Each character is well written and the three leads are cast so perfectly that none really stand out due to the fact they are all equally good. Dennis Quaid is usually hit or miss in the acting department, but this is a role that he really shines in. Topher Grace may be best known so far for "That 70's Show" but this role here proves that he will have a long acting career. And finally we come to Scarlett Johansson. While this is probably not her best role to date, she is good in any part she is in and her presence is undeniable. She is gorgeous (never looked better) and I love that voice of hers. All in all, this is a movie well worth seeing and I am glad I didn't pass this one up.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Short, Sweet, and Effective"></head><body><p>This movie is quite short, even when compared to the latest Disney movies that are 90 or more minutes long. Phone Booth is a short and sweet 82 minutes long, but don't think that the length makes it a bad movie. It's not at all. It's short because it works. The movie's situation is something that could actually happen to some poor schmuck who can't leave a ringing phone unanswered. <p>The movie stars Colin Farrell as Stu, a hotshot publicist who walks around NYC in fancy designer suits toting his cell phone everywhere he goes. Everyday, he uses the same phone booth (so the call doesn't show up on his cell where his WIFE will see it) to call an actress (played by the sincere Katie Holmes) he's representing and also hoping to get into bed with. When he's finished talking to her, the phone rings, and not even thinking, he answers it. The voice on the other end tells him that if he hangs up, he'll shoot him.<p>One of the great things about this movie is that you will not know what to think of Stu. In the beginning, you'll find that you only see Stu as a huge materialisitc jerk. I was actually hoping that he would get shot. As the story progresses, your mind may change and it may not. I won't tell you how I felt about Stu at the end, that would ruin the fun.<p>Perhaps the most amazing aspect of this movie is how effective the voice on the other end of the phone is. The voice is Keifer Sutherland, sounding clear, but raspy and scary. And the motivation of this pyscho on the other end picking on poor Stu is excellent as well. Is he really a psycho afterall? Watch and judge for yourself.<p>Colin Farrell does a great job playing a guy who is forced into an array of emotions while on the phone. It may not be Oscar worthy, but it's worth the bucks to see. And of course Keifer Sutherland, the forboding voice, is highly effective-- definitely a noteable performance. <p>Good perfermances, interesting cinematography, and certainly a lead character that anyone can relate to at some point, this movie is most definitely worth seeing. With no frills or wasted minutes of exposition, it's quick, too the point, and just an all around awesome thrill ride. And hey, if you didn't like it, it was only 82 minutes of your time.</p></body></html>

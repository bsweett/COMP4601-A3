<meta name="summary" content="Smeagol and Gollum are One"></head><body><p>This movie is easy to rewatch and easy to recommend.  The movie production is pitch perfect in every way.  There  are no misses in the casting, the set design, the dialogue and story.  The audience is never insulted with any pleas that Mr. Brooks is the innocent in the clutches of an evil separate demon.  His daughter is a born gold digger who treads carefully around her rich parents accordingly for fear of losing her inheritance.  I didn't really get to see much of Demi Moore in this movie.  Kevin Costner really dominates and Dane Cook gained just enough weight to be off-putting.  William Hurt is for once not grey and beige and vague.</p></body></html>

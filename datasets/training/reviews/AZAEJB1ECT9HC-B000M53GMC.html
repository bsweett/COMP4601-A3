<meta name="summary" content="The Most Famous Bond Film"></head><body><p>I can remember clearly when "Goldfinger" premiered in December 1964.  I was 14 at the time and was utterly amazed that this film was playing on Broadway 24 hours a day to accomodate the crowds.  (This would be repeated the following December with "Thunderball," which shockingly created even more excitement than "Goldfinger.)  I'd been a Bond fan since seeing "Dr. No" at my neighborhood theater in June 1963.  (Thats right, there were 3 James Bond films that premiered in the U.S. between May 1963 and Dec. 1964: "Dr. No in May '63, "From Russia With Love" in April '64 and "Goldfinger" in Dec. '64.  Can you imagine: 2 Connery/Bond classics premiered in the same year.  And "Thunderball" premiered almost exactly a year after "Goldfinger."  Now we have to wait at least 2 years or more for each Bond film.<br />Anyway "Goldfinger" is probably the most popular and famous 007 film.  It is great, but I don't think it has aged as well as some of the others.  I still enjoy some of the other Connerys more: "You Only Live Twice," "From Russia With Love" and "Thunderball."  But "Goldfinger," like the others mentioned, is still one of my 10 favorite Bonds.<br />I won't go into most of the positives since you've read them before.  The major flaw that has always annoyed me is, (SPOILER ALERT if you still have not seen one of the most famous films ever made,) how within the few hours, that Pussy Galore has to alert the CIA to Goldfinger's plan, they are able to switch the poison gas and get the thousands of soldiers and residents of Fort Knox, Kentucky to play dead. They even have time to create fake car crashes.  This has always seemed a bit implausible. I know that you are thinking that the Bonds have never been known for plausibility.  Still don't forget that this was still only the 3rd Bond and they were still being played straight at this time, "Moonraker" was still 15 years away.  The American soldiers also featured at the end of the film also just don't seem very American.<br />Anyway, I know I'm being picky.  "Goldfinger" is still a great Bond film and Connery is still the best Bond (Sorry, Daniel.)  He is absolutely at his best in "From Russia With Love," "Thunderball" and this film.<br />The picture on the blu-ray is terrific, beautifully clear.  Most of the extras are from the deluxe dvds released in the late '90s.  I love those "Making of" features, narrated by the great Patrick MacNee, featured on each Bond dvd and blu-ray.<br />In conclusion, if you are a Bond fan or a film fan in general and you have not seen this film, I'm quite surprised.  If you don't own it yet, this blu-ray is certainly the way to go.</p></body></html>

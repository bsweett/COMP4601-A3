It deals with scary elements of real life, rather than blood dripping scares one would expect from a so-called-vampire-movie. The acting is phenomenal when Lina Leandersson and Kare Hedebrant are together. They convincingly share a bond that makes the ending powerful, and all the more accepting.<br /><br />'Let the Right One In' invites you into a scene with small details. You listen to small sounds that draw you into the movie, like the breathing, or the clicking of a rubics cube. There isn't a plethora of dialogue, because this movie is more about visuals that create a shadowy, but familiar world.<br /><br />The movie also has some strange elements that are only muted moments from the much darker and disturbing book by John Ajvide Lindqvist. But these very strange elements are what really made me interested in this magnificient movie. Every strange event did not seem like some cheap attempt at shock value, but rather artistic and passionate. The novel presents very different routes that the movie does not recreate, but the movie stands strong by itself.<br /><br />It is a different version of the masterpiece novel that is acceptable and adds something wonderful in its own. For instance, I could never see Eli as anyone else but Lina Leandersson. The book is much more vague (purposely), while in the movie Eli is a more concrete character. I cannot go into any more detail without giving away a fascinating plot of the book, I implore you to read the book and do not search for spoilers.<br /><br />The director Tomas Alfredson is a new director to me. He seems to have a good eye for scenery and for inhibiting himself from interferring with the story. I say this because I believe he had a good chance to show more of Sweden at the risk of muddling with the pace of this movie, but he restrained himself to a few locations and kept true to a more lonely landscape. I felt that he included many scenes that would have been dropped, and looked at as mistakes in North America, but turned out to be hidden gems that made the film feel alive, with a beating heart. There are times when the children make mistakes, and in the beginning there is such a genuine flavor of nervousness under their cool exteriors that I think that the director must have set it up purposely. Taking the first few takes perhaps. I do not mean to say that there are ameteurish mistakes, far from it, it is more diliberate in my opinion.<br /><br />It is not difficult for me to say that 'Let the Right One In' is a modern masterpiece that is one of the best movies of the decade. It is a different version of the novel that adds a new layer of artistry and ideas to the vampire genre. It is a patient movie, but that swims through time. You will have watched it, restarted it and by the time you know it, have spent ten hours rewatching this film, and it would seem like you spent very little time. It is a movie that is like a romance, where you never want to spend time away. It occupies your mind for a time, and it grinds down your mind. Forget what any critics have to say, and spend little time reading about the movie, and just go see it. If you love movies, this is why. Movies like this aren't made very often.</p></body></html>

He was heard on radio and seen in comic books.  In 1941, a brief cartoon of Superman was shown in the movie theaters with the voice of Bud Collyer as "Superman".<br />  Kirk Alyn made his appearance as "Superman" in 1948 with Noel Neill as "Lois Lane".<br />  Superman returned again in the form of George Reeves as Clark Kent/Superman in "Adventures of Superman" (1952-58).  Noel Neill returned as "Lois Lane" and Jack Larson began as "Jimmy Olsen".  George Reeves was growing tired of playing "Superman" and was upset that he would be typecast.  He committed suicide, June 16 1959.  This was dramatized in the motion picture, Hollywoodland (2006).<br />  The most poignant motion picture of "Superman" came in 1978 with Christopher Reeve (no relation to George) in the title role.  He had been an actor on the soap opera "Love of Life".<br />  Superman was a super-hit with Christopher Reeve and three more movies were made, Superman II (1980), Superman III (1983), Superman IV: The Quest For Peace (1987).

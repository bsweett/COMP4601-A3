<meta name="summary" content="what a nice surprise!"></head><body><p>An animated film with great visual and sound effects that actually has (gasp!) a sharp well-written script featuring real humanlike characters, a fairly creative storyline, and even something of a subtext buried underneath it all!<br /><br />I rented this film not expecting anything more than a quick 2 hours of fluffy entertainment and a workout for my home theater system, and am happy to report that all expectations were far surpassed!<br /><br />There are some great voice performances by some great actors: Samuel L. Jackson, Holly Hunter, Elizabeth Pena, etc.<br /><br />Much more of an "adult" film than I had ever dared to hope!  But would be plenty enjoyable for the kids as well, the theme of non-conformity is certainly educational.<br /><br />And lastly but not least, if you like to watch a lot of films like this a good home theater system with a capable subwoofer is a must...I feel sorry the folks who are stuck with their TV's onboard sound!</p></body></html>

John Travolta shouldn't wonder why he's not getting any good roles lately if this is the kind of crap he thinks is worth his time. This movie is 100% recycled from the excellent original and offers nothing new but a ridiculous singing pipe dream story and far fetched bad ass John Travolta moments. Everything that worked and seemed fresh the first time around seems tired and stupid this time around. Fully unnecessary and unforgivable.</p></body></html>

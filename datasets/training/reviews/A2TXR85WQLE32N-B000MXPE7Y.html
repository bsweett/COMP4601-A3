It features an array of talented actors, promising plot material, and some incredibly atmospheric cinematography.  It is also a long, dark, unhappy journey into a world so complex as to almost defy translation into a feature length film.<br /><br />The story centers around Edward Wilson, a counterintelligence officer who at the opening of the movie is investigating a security breach affecting the failed CIA-sponsored 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion.  In a series of extended flashbacks, we learn that Edward was a young, idealist Yale graduate recruited into the Office of Strategic Services at the start of the Second World War.  He learns his trade from his British counterparts, already locked into a cutthroat duel with Nazi Germany.  Edward moves on to Berlin at the close of the war to recruit former Nazis and to size up the Soviets, who will be America's postwar competition.  In particular, he meets his Soviet counterpart, a spymaster codenamed Ulysses, who will haunt his career for the next two decades.<br /><br />Edward returns to America in 1946, to a new organization that will become the CIA and to a loveless marriage with a woman he got pregnant right before the war.  His duties will involve him in CIA adventures in Guatemala and Cuba and in handling Soviet defectors.  As the movie circles back to the present, Edward traces a series of clues to the shocking source of the leak on the Bay of Pigs.  The answer will threaten his career and what remains of his family life.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson as a quiet, dedicated but guarded man; he learns the hard way that no one can be trusted.  The hazards and hard moral choices of his career turn a likeable poetry-loving student into a man all but emotionally inaccessible by movie's end.  Angela Jolie puts in a anguished performance as Wilson's wife, who lives a sterile life with a man often gone and withdrawn when home.  Alec Baldwin has a nice turn as an FBI agent who works with Wilson on a number of cases.  John Turturro is superb as Wilson's long-time assistant.  Billy Crudup and William Hurt play fellow OSS and CIA colleagues.<br /><br />This movie gets a lot of things right about the espionage business.  The founders of the OSS and CIA relied on ties among Ivy League alumni as a substitute for a vetting process.  The spy and counterspy business between the US and Soviet Union did become a wilderness of mirrors.  The Edward Wilson character seems loosely based on James Angleton, the CIA counterintelligence chief who spent years looking for Soviet moles in the CIA.<br /><br />The story is extremely complex, even for those familiar with the history of the CIA.  The average viewer may be challenged to keep track of the characters and their motives.  The focus of the movie is really the effects of the spy business on its practioners; action is infrequent apart from the deaths of several agents.  This movie is likely to appeal primarily to serious fans of the spy business and the spy movie genre.</p></body></html>

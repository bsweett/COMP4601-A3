<meta name="summary" content="Silly Humour at Its Best"></head><body><p>"Wedding Crashers" makes no pretentious claims, and is what it is: great humour that is both silly and appealing. You can swith off and enjoy a good laugh with this movie.<br /><br />THe plot is fairly simple: two buddies gate crash weddings to hit on women and sleep with them. It happens to be something they take as an art form, and one they are pretty good at. It is when they crash the Cleary wedding that life gets interesting. Jeremy Grey, (Vaughn), gets a freaky time with one of the daughters, while John Beckwith, (Wilson), chases the other daughter, who already has a boyfriend.<br /><br />Yes, the humour is pretty crass at times, but for a good laugh that is relaxing and just plain fun to watch, this is a good choice.</p></body></html>

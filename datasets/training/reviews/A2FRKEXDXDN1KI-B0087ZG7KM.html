<meta name="summary" content="Bridesmaids" is hilarious, fun and a fantastic comedy!"></head><body><p>Saturday Night Live have generated many female stars who have transitioned successfully from television to film and you have to add Kristen Wiig to that list as her film "Bridesmaids" is hilarious, fun and a fantastic comedy!  Definitely recommended!<br /><br />It's time for another Apatow produced comedy but this time, it's not about the guys but all about the ladies in "Bridesmaids", a film written by Saturday Night Live star/comedienne Kristen Wiig and actress Annie Mumolo and directed by Paul Feig ("The Office", "Nurse Jackie", "Weeds").<br /><br />The comedy was released in May 2011 by Universal Pictures and was met with critical acclaim and surpassing "Knocked Up" as the top-grossing Judd Apatow film to date (the film was budgeted at $32.5 million and earned over $281 million in the box office).<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"Bridesmaids: Unrated" is presented in 2:40:1 anamorphic widescreen.  Picture quality for the DVD is very good as a lot of the scenes are shot outdoors BUT if you are wanting the best quality version of this film, the Blu-ray version is the way to go, because this film is quite vibrant and looks much better in High Definition.<br /><br />The Audio is presented in English, French and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 and English DVS Dolby Digital 2.0.  On DVD, the audio is clear coming through the front and center channels, good use of ambiance from the crowd and music coming from the surround channels but if you want better audio quality, once again, you will want to go for the Blu-ray version which should have a much more immersive soundtrack ala lossless.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"Bridesmaids: Unrated" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Audio Commentary - Featuring an enjoyable, upbeat and hilarious audio commentary (for the unrated edition) with director Paul Feig, co-writer Annie Mumolo and cast members Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Melissa McCarthy, Wendi McClendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper.<br />  Gag Reel - (3:47) Outtakes from "Bridesmaids".<br />  Line-O-Rama - (12:10) Featuring the multiple improvised scenes from `Bridesmaids".<br />  Deleted Scenes- (7:52) Featuring three deleted scenes: Blind Date with Dave, Bonjour and Last chance.<br />  Additional Extended & Alternate Scenes - (8:40) Featuring five extended and alternate scenes: Meet Gil & Brynn, Judy on Barb, Ham Slacks, Becca Pukes Again, Split the Rent: Breasts<br />  Cholodecki's Commercial - (1:05) Check out what's new with Cholodecki's when you watch the never-beforeseen "commercial" from Annie's jewelry employer!<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />"Bridesmaids: Unrated" comes with a slipcover case.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Finally, we get to see Kristen Wiig show us her true talent as a writer and as an actress in "Bridesmaids".<br /><br />Yes, she has appeared in "MacGruber" and "Extract" and of course, we see much more of her comedienne talents on "Saturday Night Live", but "Bridesmaids" is the film that allowed her to show her creative side as a writer but also as the lead actress.<br /><br />And what I loved about the movie is that while it does contain the hilarious, gut-busting gross out scenes that we are typically used to seeing on a Judd Apatow film, what "Bridesmaids" does much better than other Apatow films is that it manages to keep things real, in the fact that the situation Annie is in, happens to many people during this survival era during this economy.<br /><br />Depression from losing a business, depression from not making much income, depression of working a job that you don't enjoy, depression of things not working right in your life and things tend to compound itself one after the other with Annie that she is unable to deal with it.  She becomes reclusive, doesn't have many friends and the one true friend that she does have, she finds out that she has this other life with friends and also has a best friend, while Annie had always thought that she was Lilian's (Maya Rudolph) "best friend".<br /><br />Fortunately, "Bridesmaids" is a comedy thus the film doesn't explore the psyche, dark depression that Annie is in but instead showcases her ability to sabotage things in her life.  Her jealousy towards Helen (Rose Byrne) ignites this inner jealousy of trying to one-up her, but she is unable to and it just causes problems.<br /><br />Maya Rudolph's role as Lillian is possibly her best role to date.  While she does partake in some of the hilarious moments in the film, it's not forceful like other Apatow films where everyone has to be hilarious (or borderline-stupid).  She cares about her friend and trying to keep things balanced between her childhood friend Annie and her best friend Helen.<br /><br />And Rose Byrne does a fantastic job in playing the somewhat devious best friend that clamors for attention and always trying to remain positive despite not having any close relationships with anyone else around her but Lillian.  Similar to Rita, her stepkids are just as mean to her.  But Byrne looks absolutely ravishing in this role and also partakes in some of the fun moments of the film.<br /><br />But then you have the other female characters and once again, I'm sure people can relate to these type of women...Becca (Ellie Kemper) as the woman who has been with only one man and has never experienced other men, so she never really had the chance to explore and the other friend Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey) is a woman who may have married wealthy, but she is bitter about how life has changed after marriage and having children.  Having a husband who doesn't look at her the same when she was younger and having children who are young but yet are quite profane towards her.  So, Rita acts as the negative person towards Becca of how life will not always be happy and cheerful because of marriage.<br /><br />And then of course, you have the odd-ball Megan.  Melissa McCarthy's character is so off-the-wall, you just don't know what is going to come out of her mouth.  Surprising, hilarious and once again, the Apatow style of filmmaking of where improvisation really brings out the craziness of the character.  And just as off the wall are Annie's British roommates, you just don't know what will come out of their mouths as well, especially the visual of the female roommate (played by Rebel Wilson).<br /><br />And the film also has the one of the final appearances of the late Jill Clayburgh and also features the musical reunion of Wilson Phillips.<br /><br />The DVD contains both the regular theatrical edition and the director's cut. The main difference from what I have found is a scene in which Annie's British roommates are bathing with each other and when Annie goes on a blind date with a single father. There is nothing extra raunchy about the unrated version, but it was good choice for Paul Feig to eliminate those scenes from the theatrical edition.<br /><br />There are a good number of special features included and but if you have a Blu-ray player, I would definitely choose the Blu-ray edition over the DVD edition because their are many outdoor, colorful scenes and I have no doubt in my mind that those scenes would look much more vibrant in HD.<br /><br />Overall, "Bridesmaids" is a fantastic comedy.  Guys who are used to Apatow films can easily get into this film and see how an-all female cast can be equally funny (and gross) but I have to admit, of the many Apatow films I have seen so far, "Bridesmaids" is well-written and well-cast and strikes a fine balance between the crazy and hilarious moments of an Apatow film but yet managing to incorporate a screenplay that is fun, entertaining and worth watching.<br /><br />"Bridesmaids: Unrated" is definitely recommended!</p></body></html>

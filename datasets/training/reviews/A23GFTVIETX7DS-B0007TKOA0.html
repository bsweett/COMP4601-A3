<meta name="summary" content="A Buddy Movie in California Wine Country"></head><body><p>When a low-budget, independent film like "Sideways" and "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" gains a wider audience, the accompanying hype always ruins the pleasure of discovery; if you come to it too late, you are often disappointed.  And so it was for me with "Sideways." This buddy story of two unmarried men (one newly divorced and one about to be married for the first time) who spend a bachelor-party week in California wine country is competent and smoothly written/acted, but it lacks the pizzazz of a memorable movie.  This film is enjoyable and often funny, but also somewhat predictable.<br /><br />Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) have been friends since college, and they are dedicated friends despite being caught in their own personal dramas.  Miles, a whiney middle school English teacher, is mourning his divorce and hoping that his 750 page novel will be published.  Jack is a former soap opera star now relegated to commercial voice-overs who is about to get married to an Armenian beauty; Jack isn't sure about settling down, so he wants to sleep with as many women as will have him.  Miles knows everything about wine (at least, he thinks he does), and Jack knows nothing and is barely willing to learn.  The two men meet up with Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh), two wine-loving friends who are as different from each other as the guys are.<br /><br />Sandra Oh, in the smallest part of the four, steals the show with her luminous, sexy, no-nonsense characterization of Stephanie.  Giamatti's Miles grows on the viewer despite the pathetic and not always sympathetic nature of his character; the changes in Miles form the core of the film. Madsen doesn't get enough screen time, especially since her seductive monologue about "living wine" is riveting.  Church, on the other hand, plays a jerk, and it's difficult to do much with that kind of role.<br /><br />The film turns on wine, particularly the delicacy of pinot noir, and the wine talk makes the film incredibly pretentious at times. If not for the sweetness of true love and friendship, the movie could have become mired in self-importance. Ironically, Jack's ignorance keeps the tone light and saves the movie from its own snobbishness.  It is Jack's stupidity and single-mindedness that moves everything forward.<br /><br />This film is worth watching for the performances as it is more character- than plot-driven.  As long as you don't expect too much, you'll enjoy this film that melds male bonding with romantic comedy, thus appealing to both genders. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p></body></html>

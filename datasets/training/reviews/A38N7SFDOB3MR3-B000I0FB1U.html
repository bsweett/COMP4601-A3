<meta name="summary" content="Jack Black Weighs In."></head><body><p>After weighing down King Kong, Jack Black returns in the role of Nacho Libre. Jack Black plays a priest who becomes a wrestler to help an orphanage, and its newly arrived "nun babe", Sister Encarnacion (played by Ana de la Reguera).<br /><br />This movie will be a hit for its target audience. The story is fun, and Jack Black as a wrestler is priceless. If you need a few good laughs, and find the 3 Stooges funny, you will like this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Lackluster sequel to THE DA VINCI CODE."></head><body><p>Not that the first film was a classic or anything, but it was still mildly interesting. This film begins well, but then devolves into a ridiculous pseudo-mystery and becomes tedious as it goes on.<br /><br />This is Ron Howard and Tom Hanks in need of a hefty paycheck, and nothing more. Hanks' Langdon is a bore, devoid of any detectable human emotion.<br /><br />This franchise needs to end.</p></body></html>

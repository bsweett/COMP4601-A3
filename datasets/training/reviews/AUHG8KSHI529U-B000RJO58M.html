<meta name="summary" content="VERY Funny, very gross violence, but still very funny"></head><body><p>This film has such a funny light heart that it can make some amazingly gross violence seem innocuous and quite funny.  I am not sure how it is pulled off, but, really, it is FUNNY.  It is a British film so you might have a slight accent problem (I do not) and you will have to get used to the driver being on the opposite side of the police car than you expect.  But other than some turns of phrase, the movie takes on the cop genre in a way that is thoroughly understandable to anyone who has ever seen a cop film or show.<br /><br />Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a stereotypical supercop.  He has never wanted to be anything else, passed the schooling with superb scores (a double first in British terminology), and has racked up a tremendous and heroic record on the force.  His reward?  Being sent to a bucolic village far from anything requiring the kind of police work Nicholas has ever cared to do.<br /><br />But we all know that villages are not always as they seem, right?  I don't want to talk about the movie's plot because it isn't particularly difficult to figure out, but going through the parody is much more fun  than having it described to you is.  Sgt. Angel's partner, PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) is terrific (Frost and Pegg are friends and often work together).  The movie uses every, and I mean EVERY cop show clich&eacute; and makes them all fun.  Just be willing to put up with a bit of swearing (there is a swear box to raise money for the church roof, after all) and some amazing violence.  Timothy Dalton plays a terrific slimeball named Simon Skinner.  Jim Broadbent, whom I always love on screen, is superb as Inspector Frank Butterman (Danny's dad).<br /><br />Enjoy!  By The Power of Grayskull! (yeah, they use the line from He-Man in the movie).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WAY SCARIER THAN THE ORIGINAL!"></head><body><p>I just said it, this is scarrier than the first Halloween. There is more gore, more better jump scares, and more susspense. The only part that I found of distaste was the scalding the nurese's face in hot water scene, because it was disturbing and also she was a beutiful woman. My favorite in the series is Halloween: H20. Get this with Halloween 1 and H20 now.</p></body></html>

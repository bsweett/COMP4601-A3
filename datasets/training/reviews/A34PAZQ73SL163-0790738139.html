<meta name="summary" content=""Silent Night for the Hollywood P.D.""></head><body><p>"LA Confidential" is a totally hardcore ride through the underside of human nature.  When I use "hardcore", of course, I refer to it in its adrenaline filled sense (as opposed to its "wonk-wonk" music meaning).  The setting of the film takes place in the "the gray area" between right and wrong.  There's so much deception and intrigue that it becomes practically impossible to guess as to what will happen in the end.<br /><br />Eventually, we see that, regardless of surface differences, the three main characters, Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey, and Russell Crowe, are all united by their distain for the mercenary and extortionate atmosphere on the LA police force.  Early on, when we hear the chief say to Crowe, "I particularly admire your use of violence on the job," we know exactly why he acts as he does.  All three men have consciences and would prefer protecting and serving over the role they have been dealt.  They became policemen for the right reasons, but the wash of time eroded the clarity of what they stood for.<br /><br />Is this classic film noir?  Absolutely, and maybe better in quality than many of the classics.  The movie is so watchable that it seems to be over before it starts.  Not a shot or scene is wasted.  It's everything that a dud like "Cop Land" was not.</p></body></html>

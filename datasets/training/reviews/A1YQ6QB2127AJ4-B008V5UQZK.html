Beyond all the humor comes a serious side to the movie.  This is one of the most unique comedies I've seen.  Nia Vardolos needs to write more screenplays.  I especially liked the portrayal of the bunt cake.  If you watch it, you'll see what I'm talking about (can't give too much away).  There are many other scenes like it so you'll probably have your own that stick out as much as the bunt cake with me.  If anyone pees their pants from laughing so hard, don't be afraid to write it in your own review.  I'm sure it'll be a big help.</p></body></html>

Harry is certainly looking forward to going back to Hogwarts but it seems that again this year, danger awaits him. Reunited with his two best friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), they discover that Hogwarts is in dire danger as a 50-year-old mystery is reawakened by the opening of the 'chamber of secrets'. As one by one, students become mysteriously 'petrified' and soon the students begin suspecting that Harry is behind it all! Will the three friends be able to find the secret behind the chamber of secrets, and clear the good name of Harry Potter? <p>Not being a real fan of the Harry Potter series, I have not read the books. So I am reviewing this movie from the view of someone who has seen only the movies.<p>*PLOT* - The plot of the movie was the real downer of the move for me. I had found the first Harry Potter to be really interesting with its fun story and interesting theme. But unfortunately, "Chamber of Secrets", gives the feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu to the movie watcher, except this time we're led into a two hour and forty minute movie. Somehow, I must say that the story was (I'm sorry to have to say this Potter fans!) dull and boring. The plot seemed to drag a bit, and I felt that there were too many similarities between the two Potter movies. There's the Quidditch (forgive spelling mistakes) match, a secret room with deadly forces at work, a venture into the deadly forest, and much more. Maybe it's just me, but I also felt the movie was too long. The movie seemed bogged down for its length, giving the feeling as if the director tried to hard to contain as much from the book as possible while still trying to keep it interesting enough for youngsters to sit through the movie. Well, the special effects and some masterful action sequences may help to keep kids occupied, but I think the teens and adult crowd may have found it a bit tedious. <p>*ACTING* - Daniel Radcliffe has certainly grown up since the first film and handles his character very well. A bit more serious and not quite as 'innocent', he give the characterization of Harry Potter a bit more maturity. Emma Watson as Hermione Granger also does a good job, her haughtiness from the first film toned down more. Unfortunately, Rupert Grint as Ron Weasely seems to be only a comic relief to the movie as his only acting ability seems to be having this weird expression whenever his character is supposed to be scared. I couldn't help but cringe whenever he made that face, couldn't he have done a better job? Best acting done by the adult actors and actresses are most notably Richard Harris (Albus Dumbledore), Maggie Smith (Minerva McGonagall), and Alan Rickman (Severus Snape). I was disappointed that there was not much of Alan Rickman's character Snape, he was one of my favorite characters from the first film. Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart is little more than an annoying character and there should have been less of him. The same could be said about Moaning Myrtle (Shirley Henderson) who was VERY annoying!<p>*PG RATING* - It was a bit surprising for me to see that this movie is aimed for younger children. I can see how some may say how this movie shows very good morals, I must point out some conflicting points on this subject. Not only does the film make a point to show that Harry and his friends deliberately disobey the teachers and break rules, in the end they are rewarded without any punishments! I'm not sure what children are supposed to learn from this. Another reason parents might want to be cautioned is the violence. Oh, I know the violence is nothing compared to other films rated PG-13 or higher but I do know that some parts may be a bit disturbing for children. Most especially the end where Harry goes into the chamber of secrets, there's a battle going on that doesn't end simply. A bit gruesome and disturbing, I suggest that parents be cautioned.<p>*OVERALL* - Overall, the movie is a mediocre film. The good points of the movie include: 1) some good morals are shown, mostly about strong friendship and good triumphing over evil, 2) pretty good acting, nothing dramatic but still pretty good, 3) terrific effects, and 4) some nice action scenes. On the other hand, some of the bad points of the movie include: 1) a plot which seems to drag and feel stretched over a too long amount of time, 2) some unnecessarily realistic violence, 3) some questionable morals, and 4) too many similarities between the previous Harry Potter movie. As a series, I must say that unless the next movie has more of an intriguing plot with better pacing, I'm sure that non-Harry Potter fans might start finding the movies getting a bit old.</p></body></html>

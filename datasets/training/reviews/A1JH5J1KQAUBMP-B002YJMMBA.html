<meta name="summary" content="Talk about holding a grudge..."></head><body><p>While the faithful await the election of a new pope, symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and a beautiful physicist (Ayelet Zurer) follow the trail of the Illuminati, who have abducted the most likely papal candidates and threaten to destroy Vatican City in a blaze of anti-matter in retaliation for the persecution of Galileo and other scientists.<br /><br />This film features a few nail-biting scenes, so it is not as boring as its predecessor.  However, it's still just a bit too neat the way Langdon is able to follow the trail of hidden clues and it's unclear why the villains would provide such clues in the first place.  Oh, wait, that's right...without them, there would be no movie.</p></body></html>

You old prudes, this movie barley had the F word in it. Boo Hoo! WAHH! Why don't you get out more and stop living under the 1950's rock you were born under.<br />  **Oh and Pierpont Snicklefritz, I'm glad you mentioned "intellectually able" because "Obviuosly" is spelled "Obviously" and "suttle" is spelled "subtle" Just goes to show you what kind of people like this movie.</p></body></html>

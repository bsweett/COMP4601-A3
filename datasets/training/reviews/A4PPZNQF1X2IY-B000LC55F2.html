<meta name="summary" content="Decent flick, long live Tesla!"></head><body><p>The movie gets points for being engaging and dramatic, and for making<br /><br />you think a bit in order to follow the chopped up timeline.  The movie<br /><br />gets a bonus point for honoring the great Nikola Tesla.  However, it loses that extra point for creating the ridiculous doppleganger machine<br /><br />("Attention Checkov, this is the Captain, please beam us up!  zzzzoooolllluuuulllluuuuu").  Ok, that was a downer, totally ridiculous ending, but I was taken up in the story.  Jackman and Bale<br /><br />do good work, as of course does Sir Caine. SJ, meanwhile showed as much emotion as a lamp post and was awful.  Finnaly, David Bowie nailed Tesla, great work.  I'd like to see him on the stage again.</p></body></html>

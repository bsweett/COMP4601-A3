<meta name="summary" content="Fun action movie but lacking trully hd picture..."></head><body><p>Watching this movie hasn't really changed since the DVD days.  The story is exciting and the action is constantly flowing.  That is why this movie gets four stars from me.<br /><br />What keeps this movie from getting five stars is the grainy picture.  I have a 1080p and watching other hd movies looked good.  This movie appeared as they did very little to enhance the quality of picture.  The picture was grainy and really didn't appear any better than my dvd version.  You may want to invest in some other movie with a better quality picture unless you haven't viewed it before.</p></body></html>

While not as good as Anchorman, I found the Ferrell Reily team to be very funny.  Cohen is excellent in a new role as a gay French race car driver.  Not very long on plot and very few suprises keep this from being anything other than an over the top silly comedy.  This one is a good buy and good for repeated viewings.</p></body></html>

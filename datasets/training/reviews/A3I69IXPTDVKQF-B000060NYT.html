<meta name="summary" content="Like Its Sequel, An All-Time Great - Essential Horror"></head><body><p>"Jeepers Creepers" is one of the ultimate horror movies, scary, awe-inspiring, emotionally powerful, and outstandingly made.  Like its sequel, it's the kind of movie that starts off extremely strong and compelling, and doesn't lag for a single second, right through the end credits.  What it starts out with is a brother and sister driving across the prairielands on a crosscountry trip home during a college break, when they encounter something dark, sinister, and dangerous, but which they're left compelled to investigate because of the simple fear that others may be in deep danger if they don't.  What they encounter is the Creeper, and his lair; and one of the most inventive and flat-out awesome of all horror mythologies to ever spring out fully formed upon the screen.  Twists and turns abound, all of them superbly played out.  Excellent characterization, cinematography, and special effects.  An all-time great.</p></body></html>

A mere seven months have passed since Britney's "Crossroads" experience summed up the destruction of 40 years worth of feminist progress.  And now Eminem, rap's bad, white guy, takes a drive down "8 Mile," making a case that he's both a serious artist and a serious actor.  Critics argue he is neither; whether it's the PC crowd from the left or the "gotta be offended at something" crowd from the right, it's easy to hate someone who presents such an easy target.  But, like Elvis, a figure Eminem references several times in his songs, he continues to appeal to youth and upset the adults, all while making oodles of money and, now, films worthy of praise.<p>"8 Mile" (the name refers to the road in Detroit that separates the white suburbs from the black inner-city) showcases a week in the life of wannabe rapper Rabbit.  Like Eminem, Rabbit fights for respect in the black-dominated rap underground.  Like Eminem, Rabbit lives with his mother in a trailer park.  And like Em, Rabbit is desperate for a way to get out.  His friends encourage him to become involved with "battles," 45-second freestyle raps where two contestants try to insult each other, and the best insults win.  Although Rabbit readily lets his rhymes slip at work and at play, when it's crunch time, he chokes.  The movie opens with Rabbit blowing a contest, and then stumbling home to explain to his alcoholic mother (a perfectly cast Kim Bassinger) that he broke up with his "pregnant" girlfriend and gave her the car.<p>The movie then moves through a series of vignettes - Rabbit at work, Rabbit at play, Rabbit in love, Rabbit rapping - with the desperation of his situation tightening like choke-collar.  The "plot" is loose at best; "8 Mile" could best be described as a slice-of-life with a "Rocky"-like ending (like we didn't know that was coming).  The utter poverty and hopelessness which pervades the film is superceded by a single ray of hope: that there may be a way, through talent, to rise above the cycle of poverty that has dragged every one of Rabbit's friends and family into despair.  It finally becomes a decision between working overtime for guaranteed cash, or taking a risk and aiming for something more - a choice that any creative person will recognize.<p>"8 Mile" works because it ignores its star and stays true to the spirit of creativity.  What could easily have been a "look at me" movie for Eminem remains a "look at THIS' movie about creative people trapped in the worst of urban conditions.  The ending of the film does not have Rabbit signing a multi-million dollar record deal, or marrying the girl, or becoming a superstar.  It's a small but important victory in a person's life, and keeps the entire film in perspective.  Director Curtis Hanson did the impossible: took a musical artist and turned him into a great actor in a very good movie.  Take a walk down "8 Mile," but check your cynicism at the door.<p>Final Grade: A-</p></body></html>

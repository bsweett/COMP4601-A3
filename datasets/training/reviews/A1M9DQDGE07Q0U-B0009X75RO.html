<meta name="summary" content="DISAPPOINTING TRANSFER - LOUSY EXTRAS, but ALL THAT JAZZ!"></head><body><p>&quot;Chicago&quot; is the Academy Award winning musical from 2002 that brought back the genre in elegant style.  Set during the rum running twenties, the plot loosely follows to murderesses (Catherine Zeta Jones-Douglas and Rene Zellweger) who are awaiting their fate on death row.  Enter the over confident lawyer (Richard Gere)who promises to make it all better.  Electrifying musical numbers rock this rather flat story and bump up the action a well deserved notch - but was this really the Best Picture of 2002?!?!<br />Mirimax's DVD won't be winning any awards.  Colors are well balanced but flesh tones are overly pinkish and flat.  Fine details are lost in the darker scenes, even when viewing the movie in a completely blackened room.  Edge enhancement and aliasing crop up now and then, though nothing that will terribly distract.  Film grain is a real problem - certain scenes are smooth as silk while others look as though they are at least twenty years old. (Herein I am not making references to the stylistic aged look employed during certain segments of the movie but various shots within a particular scene that veer wildly between generally smooth to excessively grainy.  Check out Zeta Jone's &quot;All That Jazz&quot; number that opens the film. When Rene Zellweger intrudes with her own bar and chorus, the background information in the shot is suddenly riddled with grit, grain and a digital harshness.)  Not a terrible mastering effort - just not an exemplary one and for a BEST PICTURE WINNER of one year vintage, entirely unacceptable.  The audio is 5.1 and DTS but neither are particularly distinguished though both offer an aggressive bass and some kick during the musical numbers.<br />EXTRAS:A deleted song, audio commentary and theatrical trailer.<br />BOTTOM LINE: I would have at least expected a &quot;making of&quot; for this movie but I suppose Miramax is holding that back for a special &quot;deluxe&quot; edition sure to be out before Christmas.  This is a very disappointing over all marketing of a BEST PICTURE - especially one that garnered tons of critical attention and a host of awards!</p></body></html>

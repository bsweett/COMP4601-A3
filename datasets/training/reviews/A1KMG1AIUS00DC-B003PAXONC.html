The story combines science fiction and horror in a bleak, pessimistic view of the future of mankind.<br /><br />In the latest version, "I Am Legend," Smith stars as Robert Neville, a scientist who was unable to halt the spread of an incurable, man-made virus.  Immune to the fatal virus, Neville is the sole human survivor in what remains of New York City and possibly the world.  His only companion is his dog, Samantha.  But mutant plague victims -- the Infected -- lurk in the darkness, watching Neville's every move and waiting for him to make a fatal mistake.  Day to day, Neville is driven by a single mission:  to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus.  To do so, he must use his own immune blood.<br /><br />"I Am Legend" is by far the most ambitious of the three screen adaptations of Matheson's novel.  The opening scenes, showing a deserted Times Square overgrown with vegetation, are spectacular, and Smith manages to keep the story flowing in the early scenes even though he's the only person we see.  Flashbacks illustrate the stages leading up to the present near-obliteration of humanity and are elaborately staged by director Francis Lawrence.  The film's third act resorts to a fairly routine formula of the hero versus the monsters but, overall, "I Am Legend" is an impressive effort.<br /><br />The "I Am Legend Ultimate Collector's Edition" is just the thing for sci-fi and Will Smith fans.  The three-disc box set contains two versions of the movie, one with a controversial ending; a digital copy of the film; four animated comics; 12 never-before-seen deleted scenes along with filmmaker's commentary; a 44-page concept sketch book; a lucite commemorative piece featuring images from the movie; and hours of featurettes covering filming on the aircraft carrier Intrepid, canine training, making New York City look deserted, assistance provided by the U.S. Military, and the integration of CGI images with live action footage.</p></body></html>

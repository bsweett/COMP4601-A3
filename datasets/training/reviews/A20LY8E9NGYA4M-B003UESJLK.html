<meta name="summary" content="ONE OF THE GREATEST FANTASY FILMS OF ALL-TIME."></head><body><p>In 2002, Steven Spielberg decided to release an updated version of his 1982 classic "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial". Universal announced that this update included new footage and new digital effects. Some people complain about the new special effects and the added scenes, but to be honest, it's not a big change, it's just some makeup that doesn't change the heart and soul of the movie: the story and the characters.<br /><br />This movie features our favorite alien, a little squashy guy known as E.T., he gets involved in a very special relationship with a little boy when he is left alone in the Earth. And that friendship is one of the strongest things about "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial". Steven Spielberg created a great dynamic with the cast (specially the children), it's easy to see the wide display of emotions that these young actors printed on the movie. The adults are very good, but the young actors stole the show on this film.<br /><br />"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial" has some of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history, a lot of people was touched with the brief death of E.T., or the return of the little alien to his home, or the magical scene when Elliott and E.T. cross the sky at night in a bicycle with the moon as background. This movie is the best thing that most of the cast was involved in. Henry Thomas (Elliott) and Robert MacNaughton (Michael) never were involved in a project of this size. Only Drew Barrymore remains very popular today, but most of the people will forever see her as the cute Gertie.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg solidified an already strong reputation as a remarkable filmmaker with "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial", and John Williams (his favorite composer) created more incredible songs for the score of the movie. Spielberg filmed movies of greater scale, but "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial" remains as his more emotional movie. The DVD features great stuff that the fans of this movie will love, so if you like "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial", then the DVD is a must-buy</p></body></html>

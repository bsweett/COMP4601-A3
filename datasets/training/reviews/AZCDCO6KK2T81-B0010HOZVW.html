<meta name="summary" content="The Brave One: A most appropriate title for this film."></head><body><p>A powerful and Oscar worthy performance by Jodie Foster is unfortunately overlooked because far too many associated this film with Charles Bronson's classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000541AN">Death Wish</a>.<br /><br />While there are definitely similar themes in both films and strong performance are given by both leads, this film is far more cerebral with its approach than Bronson's film.  We feel Foster's pain more via her bravura performance and especially since as a radio DJ she has the unique opportunity to air her thoughts on the subject at hand, vigilantism, and hear how others think of her actions (without realizing they are actually speaking to the vigilante herself).  This puts a powerful psychological spin on the story often lacking in other similarly themed films.<br /><br />I also found the title intriguing as it may be asking a question more than defining a character here.  Foster's Erica Bane, clever choice in last name which means burden or cause of ruin, is conflicted over whether her actions are praise-worthy or even brave as both topics come up on her radio talk show.  Her reaction is bewilderment to think others think she is brave when she believes she is acting out of fear, and disgust for those that think she is "doing the city a favor" somehow or for finding her behavior easy.<br /><br />She does her actions as a compulsion to rectify a wrong, to vent, and, yes, get revenge.  She does not believe she is "helping" the city and is angry at that perception and with herself for this obsession that is now invading every part of her being.  These criminals who hurt her have taken more than her finance, they have taken her peace of mind and a chunk of her life and she is angry that many don't understand this.  She feels very misunderstood by most except for a detective, excellently portrayed by Terrance Howard, who is on to her, but very sympathetic as he is something of a tortured soul himself.<br /><br />The film explores just who is brave here.  Is it Bane for facing her anger, for finding a manner in which to vent, for seeking resolution, for simply surviving her harrowing encounter, or is it the power that a gun gives one.  It's easy to be brave with a gun in your hand is an underlying message in this story as it was in a famous novel I just finished teaching my students this week.  Atticus Finch said in Harper Lee's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060935464">To Kill a Mockingbird</a> to his son Jem who watched an old woman die facing a battle most could not or would not face themselves and said, "I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand."  Courage isn't measured by how many bullets one has, but by how one faces a struggle in which one can't win.<br /><br />Foster's Bane seem to feel great anger at herself for the control that she has allowed some criminals to have over her life and for the power she was finding in a gun.  Isn't this why some carry a gun?  For power?  For control?  For their notion on what justice is or ought to be?<br /><br />Who is the brave one?<br /><br />Sadly, it isn't the writer or director who choose to take an emotionally charged and intelligently developed story and go down a trite, contrived, and completely unrealistic resolution to a story as provocative as this one started out as and could have and should have ended as such.  Those who like their stories to end with a neat bow will be pleased, but others who prefer realism and honesty in films will resent the cheap cowardly ending this film contains and that is my only reason for this film getting four stars instead of five and perhaps why it got snubbed at the Oscars even though Foster's performance and Terrance Howard as the detective keeping tabs on her are completely flawless even with the silly ending they are forced to act out with a straight face.</p></body></html>

The only thing I can think of is that the film was a lot different than I thought it would be based on the movie trailer, which made it out to be a scary thriller. It's not that at all. The movie revolves around three people living in three different countries who all are affected by death in some way. One man is a medium of sorts and has the ability to communicate with the dead. A woman survives a near-death experience that changes her life. And a young boy is lost after the death of his brother and is desperately searching for answers and reassurances.<br /><br />I thought the movie was great. It tackled this sensitive subject matter from multiple perspectives and was incredibly moving at times (I teared up during some of the Marcus/Jason scenes). Clint Eastwood is amazing, and "Hereafter" is just one more of his brilliant films.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great action and lots of fun"></head><body><p>I enjoyed this movie on DVD and it is even better on HD DVD.  Great picture quality with the lush jungle scenes and lots of bass in the soundtrack.<br /><br />The movie is also very entertaining with lots of action and humor.  The Rock plays a goon that has been sent to retrieve his bosses son played by Seann William Scott (a.k.a Stiffler from American Pie).  The interaction between them is hilarious.  The great Christopher Walken plays the bad guy and he is his classic self.  His awesome dialogue (I wonder how much was ad-libbed?) and his pants pulled up to his drooping breasts add the finishing touches to this terrific movie.  I think this is the Rock's best movie and a sequel must be made!</p></body></html>

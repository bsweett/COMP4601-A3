<meta name="summary" content="24 meets The Fugitive with Douglas and Sutherland"></head><body><p>Michael Douglas was a great choice as a Secret Service agent (the one shot during the Ronald WReagan attempted assasination) wrongfully accused of being a mole., with Keifer as his protege/accuser, in this thriller. I have to say, I was drawn into this film from minute one, as the movie began giving us an insight into secret service routines and code names for the President and the First Lady. Then, when Douglas is blackmailed for having an affair with the First Lady (Kim Basinger), I was totally hooked.<br /><br />From there, the film takes on a bit of the `No Way Out' (film with Kevin Costner)theme, and THEN becomes a noir version of The Fugitive with Keifer pursuing Douglas with Douglas being suspected as mole in a plot against the President. Thankfully, the writers decided Keifer wasn't a mindless drone and was able to figure out Douglas was framed.<br /><br />From there, it becomes a run against the clock to stop the assasination of the President.<br /><br />Any more info gives the movie away. Just trust me, I do NOT give good reviews to Hollywood pap like some reviewers who think good reviews get them on Amazon. You will enjoy this film. It is a top notch thriller.<br /><br />4 stars, only because I pictured Harrison Ford in Michael Douglas' part.</p></body></html>

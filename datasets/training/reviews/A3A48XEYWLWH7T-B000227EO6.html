<meta name="summary" content="Almost languid ending"></head><body><p>Thursday, August 12, 2004 / 4 of 5 / Almost languid ending.<br /><br />Compared to the frenetic carnage of the first installation, the second has an almost languid ending to the chop-socky revenge saga.  Uma returns as the bride and continues her quest to wreak revenge on those who apparently killed her and her unborn child.  As the scenes shift between southwest spaghetti western locales and her training in the east; I was reminded that I actually preferred the first installment's Tokyo rumble and the treatment.  Granted, a second dose of the same killing would be tough to handle, it was just ... different.  More introspective and dare I say it, calm in its damage.  Uma is more precise here and not as whirlwind, tearing through 88 gangsters.  Taken together, it's an impressive homage piece and artistic statement.</p></body></html>

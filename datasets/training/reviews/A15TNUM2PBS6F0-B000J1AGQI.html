<meta name="summary" content="Another war movie...."></head><body><p>"We Were Soldiers" is the latest film about the Vietnam War.<br />It is based on the book by Lt. Col. Hal Moore, who is portrayed quite intensely by Mel Gibson.<br />I am not a big fan of this genre, and was pretty much dragged into it by my husband.  I certainly don't feel that my time was wasted by any means.  It was very well done, and I thought some of the acting was just brilliant. Sam Elliot deserves the Oscar for his role!  He is great in this movie, and his character gets some of the best lines of the script.<br />Madeline Stowe, who I have never liked as an actress, plays Moore's wife.  Her and t.v.'s Felicity, Keri Russell, become fast friends being wives on base while the men are away at war.<br />It was just heart wrenching to watch them go to the homes of the women who had lost their Hero husbands to the elements of War. <p>It is so hard for me to review this movie, let alone recommend it. I think of going to the movies as an escape from real life. This is no escape. It is a slap in the face of the realities of the Vietnam War.  Although, this is a slap that leave a lifetime mark. Recommended to die hard fan of war movies, especially Vietnam.  I haven't read the book, but I am sure it's best to read it before seeing this.</p></body></html>

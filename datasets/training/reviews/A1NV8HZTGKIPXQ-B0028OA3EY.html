<meta name="summary" content="Many Happy 'Returns'"></head><body><p>Let me start off by saying that the first two Chris Reeve films were the first movies I ever saw as a little boy. They changed me. Superman and the films sculpted my entire childhood. 19 years later, we get to witness his return. And what a wonderful return. By now, you probably already know the details of the film. Superman comes back after 5 years, Lois Lane has moved on and has a kid and a fiancee, and Lex Luthor is plotting a new real estate scheme involving Superman. But really, how is the film itself?. Folks, I had a great time with this movie. It's big, it's breathtaking, and makes you happy. Superman is back, and we couldn't be happier. Brandon Routh is wonderful. I saw Chris Reeve in him early on, but it doesn't last long. He becomes Clark/Superman and makes it his own. Spacey is wonderful as Luthor. There is some humor there, but this is not Gene Hackman or Michael Rosenbaum. This Lex is nastier and deadlier. Bosworth does well, is beautiful, but doesn't have much beyond being hurt over Superman's disappearance and being the damsel in distress. Story wise, it's out there(at least the Lex part, but does one come to these films for intricate plots?. John Williams' theme and other familiar Superman scores pop up, and they really take you back and make this film soar. The effects are not only astonishing and visually stunning, but some are just breathtaking. The look of the film is beautiful and so well detailed and planned out. The movie is just superb looking. Some complain the film is too long, light on action, and moves slow. The movie is long, but this shouldn't be a problem to anyone. Light on action?. If you call the chilling and mesmerizing airplane sequence, roof top gun fire, earthquake, water rescue, and more and more light on action. Folks, this movie isn't light on anything. There are a number of homages to Richard Donner's film, and they will bring smiles to any true Superman fan. How about Lois' kid?. The boy is great. Just a normal boy who isn't forced to be cute or whatnot. A great kid and a great kid actor. There are a number of memorable moments here that aren't soon to be forgotten. The airplane sequence is incredible and the best sequence in any Superman movie. I could go on. Do I have complaints?. Very, very minor ones. I would've liked more scenes that were cut in Smallville(James Karen must be ticked)back in, and the last half seemed kind of dark. Like it was a "Batman" film or something. Basically, my gripes are meaningless to the greatness of the film. The movie is dedicated to the memory of Chris and Dana Reeve. Sadly, this comes after the end credits when it should of come before, when more people would see it. Noel Neill and Jack Larson are along for the ride as well. And what a ride. Superman Returns is filled with wonderful humor, real, genuine heart and emotion, wonderful set pieces and score and imagery. This is one summer blockbuster that justifies the term. Go see it, and await anxiously for Superman's next big return.</p></body></html>

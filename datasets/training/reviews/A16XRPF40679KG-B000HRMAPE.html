<meta name="summary" content="I like cruise but these movies suck."></head><body><p>Mission impossible is about a TEAM of professionals who go after the enemies of america. This movie and the rest are abominations that even Tom cruise can't save. The plot is thin which I could forgive if this wasn't a HIGH budget movie.  And of course there is no team in this movie. Instead it's a lone action hero, if this was called "man impossible" then I might give it a break. It's excrement though as a movie; that is based on a good premise that is not here barely. Even worse the whole idea of fighting bad guys has to always include the american government. ???<br />It's not related to mission impossible. AND HORRIBLY there are going to create another one of these monstrosities. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!!!!!! let me guess, evil americans are out to get tom cruise. who can't be killed of course. which is fine if this didn't have the misssion impossible NAME ON IT. I do like cruise. he's good but these movies are a disgrace.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Intense Horror Film"></head><body><p>The original part 1 'Wrong Turn' movie is quite suspenseful and intense horror film.  I am not really a fan of horror movies but sometimes if they are on basic cable channels I will watch one every now and then.  For me they are good to watch only once unless there is a good true story to it that I can take something away from it.  There are movies that might have some horror like scenes to them but are not true movies of that category.  'Wrong Turn' is a true horror flick that should satisfy the average horror movie fan.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></body></html>

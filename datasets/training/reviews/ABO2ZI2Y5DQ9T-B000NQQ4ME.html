<meta name="summary" content="Mel Gibson's Engrossing Adventure Story"></head><body><p>Mel Gibson continues to explore bravery and cruelty of humans. You can describe the story of "Apocalypto" in this way, but the fact is his latest work as director is a very engrossing adventure tale in the tradition of "The Last of the Mohicans." The difference is this adventure tale is set against the background of the last days of Mayan civilization; and as in his Oscar-winning "Braveheart," "Apocalypto" comes with lots of violence.<br /><br />The story revolves around Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), his beloved wife Seven and young son, and the villagers living peacefully in the rainforest. One day his village is attacked by the merciless soldiers sent from the plague-infected city, where the captured men and women are brought for the purpose you have already guessed. Jaguar Paw knows he must come back home before the next rain falls because his wife (who is pregnant) and child are trapped in the bottom of a dried well, and he does it no matter what it takes.<br /><br />The story itself is rather conventional, but the way it is presented is unique. All the dialogues are spoken in the Mayan language, and most of the cast are non-professionals without previous experience as actor. The cinematography is by Dean Semler ("Dances with the Wolves"), but the shooting is mostly done digitally by HD camera. But you wouldn't mind all these things once the film starts to roll and tell its story about Jaguar Paw and the warriors chasing him in the jungle.<br /><br />As to the film's content, it is true that there is violence in the film (like the execution scene of "Braveheart"), but it must be also pointed out that Mel Gibson does not make it gratuitous and excessive. Of course all these things depend on every viewer's sensitivity and certainly this film is not made for pre-teens, but Gibson avoids too direct descriptions of murders, rapes and decapitations.<br /><br />The production designs are amazing to see, but I am not sure of the historical accuracy of the customs of Mayan people or the streets and buildings of the city. I cannot judge that part. But I am sure this is an exciting, well-told adventure story that will keep you absorbed in the world unknown.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="About Mules"></head><body><p>This film effectively brings the world of drug mules to the big screen.<br /><br />A bright, albeit stubborn 17-year old Colombian girl stumbles upon the world of traffiking drugs into the USA through swallowing pills, and pooping them out.<br /><br />The film is paced just right, and it develops the lead lady's character quite nicely. There are some disturbing moments, as there should be, 'cause lots of disturbing things happen in this world.<br /><br />The acting was top-notch (except the 2 guys in the USA who recieve the mules--they were really bad actors), the script was great...a very fine film. I highly reccomend this to all drama lovers.<br /><br />And for all you rock/pop en espanol fans, there's a new JULIETA VENEGAS tune at the end!</p></body></html>

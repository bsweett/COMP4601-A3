<meta name="summary" content="Violence & Ultra-violence from the `70s!"></head><body><p>Amazingly, director Stanley Kubrick's (1928-1999) career comprises only 16 films of which just 9 of them were done after his first great success: "Paths of Glory" (1957).<br /><br />With this rather small amount of movies in his 50 years as film director, he carved a place in Director's Olympus!<br /><br />He had a controversial personality, obsessive and perfectionist was dreaded by actors due to his "do it again" that may conduct to dozens of retakes.<br /><br />"A Clockwork Orange" (1971) was, arguably, his most controversial opus. Scenes of sex & violence leaded to film's exhibition being banished in many countries (Argentina amongst them), so we were able to see it for the first time many years after its release.<br /><br />There are scenes of rape, gratuitous violence against senior people, drug abuse and sheer madness.<br /><br />Nevertheless all these violence is not senseless as in most contemporary movies. It tries to shock the viewer and make her/him reflect about public and private use of power, social and individual manipulation, hypocrisy and family relationships amongst other critical issues.<br /><br /> The story, adapted from Anthony Burgess' sci-fi novel of the same title, is situated in a decadent future (may be due to post-WWIII conditions) at London.<br /><br />In this world teenagers band in quartets, consume exciting drugs, fight each other ruthlessly, use a peculiar language (the novel provides a glossary at the end of the book), ravage isolated country villas and commit remorselessly whatever violent act comes to their fogged minds. At the same time some institutions as penitentiaries & police force still stick to old repressive codes.<br /><br />Alex is the leader of one of these infamous quartets until an "excess" lead him into prison. Being there he will apply to receive an innovative "conversion" method.<br /><br />The outcome of this therapy-conversion method will have unexpected results.<br /><br />Malcolm McDowell in the best performance of his extended professional life fleshes Alex de Large. Michael Bates is very good too as Chief Guard.<br /><br />As is his trade mark, Stanley Kubrick, uses non-original music score outstandingly. During the movie it may be heard Beethoven's 9th Symphony, three opera overtures from Rossini and in a key scene Brown's "Singing in the Rain".<br /><br />Color cinematography is product of John Alcott, who will team with Kubrick two more times, wining an Oscar with "Barry Lyndon".<br /><br />It is a great movie only recommended for adult mature audience!<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

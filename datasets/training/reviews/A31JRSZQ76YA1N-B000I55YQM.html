<meta name="summary" content="CHIPS ON MY SOLDIER, err shoulder, err ......"></head><body><p>IMPACT? A Curious Tale seen through the looking glass of Global Corporations and the impact ...... the Global impact ...<br /><br /> SO? This one hits close to home - beloved son returns as War hero, later his ambitious mother [read Lady MacBeth] shoves sonnyboy headlong into the political meatmarket.<br /><br /> PROBLEM? Combat buddies [falling fast] seem to be having the same recurring nightmares about sonnyboy and the 'rescue'.<br /><br /> THIS version does not quite follow the same path the original 'flew' but hits home in rather a nice way. Along the way - especially towards the 'conclusion?' We really hit a double wammy - very, very NICE.<br /><br /> MAKE SENSE? 'Control, control and more mob control' - most chilling is the TV 'fodder' CGI corrections at the end ...... not that startling....think Lee H.O. As for those color-coded 'Threat Warnings'!<br /><br /> TECH CREDITS? Costumes, Art direction - music - all quite good - Oscar calibre work.<br /><br /> STREEP as Lady Mac, or ...err ... 'You know who's lookalike' is fairly chilling, but one can sympathize with Ellie ... after all 'just WHERE are all the real men' [leaders?] in today's world? She also spews rather an interesting bot mot about one's neighborhood serial killer[s]. Prime scenes for STREEP - especially the 'Marketing' of the Candidate - and the Electoral Vote structure ...... Florida???<br /><br /> [Unless you have your head buried somewhere and still believe in Kansas].<br /><br /> WASHINGTON? Nice, modulated performance.<br /><br /> SCHREIBER? Very moving, very effective as 'Our Son' - nom worthy here.<br /><br /> VOIGHT? Slightly wasted, but excellent in the confrontation[s] with Streep.<br /><br /> Most chilling is the 'South African' rogue doctor somewhat physically a Hitler lookalike. Lots of cameos [Dean Stockwell, Ted Levine - other Demme alumni]<br /><br /> BUT still can't quite forget the LANSBURY version ......<br /><br /> FOR SHEER PERVERSION?<br /><br /> TOM HANKS in the "Ellie' role ~ CHARLIZE THERON ? Raymond natch!<br /><br />MERYL as Tom Hanks?</p></body></html>

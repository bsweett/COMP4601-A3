This one isn't quite as good as National Treasure (so what if I like Nick Cage better??!!) but I still had a great time-- the action, the stupid sidekick, the foreign chick, this movie has it all.<br /><br />Dirk (McConaughey) works for NUMA (I forget what that stands for). Basically, he's a treaure hunter. His best friend is played by Steve Zahn-- these two have great chemistry. Dirk has been searching for a long lost ship, supposedly stranded somewhere in Africa. A girl is tossed into the mix, a worker for the World Health Organization played by Penelope Cruz. She's looking into some kind of outbreak that is killing hundreds. The three get tangled up together, Dirk still seeking his treasure while helping the girl figure out the source of this disease. It gets more complicated, though nothing that will hurt your brain, but it's all good fun.<br /><br />All in all, a pretty fun movie. Awesome on the big screen, one of the great reasons to see it at the theater. I love how everything is connected and is wrapped up in the end, even if it is a bit extreme and far-fetched. That's what movies are, after all. If you don't like action, see this movie for McConaughey's tan, buff body. Or Zahn's comic zaniness, which is just fantastic (he loses his hat three times in this movie, all of which are big deals, to him at least!!). RECOMMENDED!</p></body></html>

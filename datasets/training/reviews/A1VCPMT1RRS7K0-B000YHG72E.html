<meta name="summary" content="What's a Christmas Gram? I want one!"></head><body><p>Elf is a Christmas story with a twist.<br /><br />The twist is provided, in the midst of a cute Christmas story, by the writing of Jon Favreau and the performance of Will Ferrell.  The movie manages to stay innocent, while still allowing Will to be expressive with his natural brand of humor.  It's a Christmas movie that everyone can enjoy, children and adults alike, as it appeals to both the kid in all of us, as well as our more adult sensibilities.<br /><br />The Infinifilm edition includes 2 discs: One contains the Widescreen version and special features and the other contains the Full Screen version and special features.  There is plenty on the interactive DVDs to keep you busy for quite a while, including quality featurettes, deleted scenes, games you (or the kids) can play, commentaries and even DVD-rom features.<br /><br />This is a new favorite to add to the Christmas list.</p></body></html>

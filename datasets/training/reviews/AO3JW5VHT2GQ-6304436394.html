But this is just one of the many plots in this movie.  <p>Barillo (Willem Dafoe), the drug lord in this latest installment in the 'Mariachi' series, has hatched a plot to remove the Mexican President (Pedro Armend&aacute;riz Jr.) from power by staging a coup, headed by the same general El Mariachi wants to kill, General Marquez.  But CIA agent Sands (Johnny Depp) isn't about to let this happen, or something like that.  So, he has contracted with El Mariachi to kill General Marquez.  However, Sands is betrayed by another agent and in the end it all comes down to the mysterious Mariachi (a.k.a. El), his henchmen, and a retired FBI agent to stop Barillo and General Marquez.<p>My Comments:<br />I'm actually amazed I'm giving this movie as good of a rating as I am because the story isn't at all coherent.  But despite the incoherencies, it has some redeeming qualities that make this an engaging film.  <p>First, as far as the story goes, I think my summary illustrates that there is a loosely developed plot underlying the movie, but what is missing from my summary are the haphazard cuts from one subplot to the next as the story tries to develop.  Incorporated into the larger story are a number of intentional throwbacks to the earlier films in the series.  For instance, there is a sequence in which El Mariachi and Carolina slide down a wire onto a moving vehicle which mirrors a nearly identical sequence in the original El Mariachi.  Also, the boy with the bike is also a throwback to the original El Mariachi as there was also a pudgy boy on a bike in that film.  There are probably even more sequences that integrate the films (the opening scene is nearly identical to the opening scene in Desperado), but I haven't watched the movies that closely (I don't think they warrant it).  So, perhaps some of the haphazard cutting and loose story structure can be justified based upon the intent to incorporate these throwbacks.  But in the end, you pretty much just have to admit there isn't a very clear or engaging plot driving this film.<p>Even with the nearly incoherent story line, I found myself engaged with the movie. But what was engaging me wasn't the story - it was the commentary on action films and some of the subtler points of the film.  Let me explain.  I'm basing my opinion of this movie on the assumption that it was intentionally trying to mock action films.  If it wasn't, then this is really a terrible movie.  But if it was trying to mock action films, then it does a great job.  There are so many ridiculous shoot out sequences and so many people that are killed for no apparent reason, that you can't help but laugh.  So, if you watch this movie with that perspective, you should actually enjoy it. However, I should note that this commentary/mocking quality loses its edge by the end of the film.  After the 700th time you see some guy get shot and fly about 40 feet through the air as the result of being hit by a 9mm bullet, it gets old.<p>Another key factor to enjoying this film is Johnny Depp.  As a Depp fan, I always recommend people watch him closely, but in this film he is hands down the greatest redeeming quality.  I'm still laughing at the scene in which he was wearing the C.I.A. shirt.  He was a C.I.A. agent working in Mexico and wearing a shirt that clearly identified him.  Brilliant humor!  There are a few weaker sequences, but for the most part Depp is the only actor carrying this story.  Even Banderas, whose extreme close-ups seem to last interminably long, pales in comparison to Depp. I should also note that even though Selma Hayeck is headlined in this movie, her role is pretty peripheral.  After all, she starts the movie dead.  She is only seen in dream sequences that play out in the Mariachi's head.  The rest of the cast is okay, but not particularly brilliant.  <p>Overall, I'm impressed at what that one $7,000 dollar film did for Robert Rodriguez's career.  But I'm really beginning to hope he's gotten El Mariachi out of his system.  The fact that El Mariachi was vying for the lead actor role in this film is somewhat revealing - there's only so much you can do with guitar cases and weaponry and I think Rodriguez has done it all and then some.  If he can't come up with a clear story to culminate this series, I'd recommend he look for another project (and please, not another installment in the Spy Kids series; it's beginning to feel like Rambo or Rocky).  If you've seen the movies leading up to this one, you may enjoy it.  You may also enjoy it if you like Depp and approach this film expecting it to be mocking of action films.  Otherwise, I don't think I'd recommend this it.</p></body></html>

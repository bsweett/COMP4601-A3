<meta name="summary" content="Manhunter."></head><body><p>The HOPKINS/LECTOR shtick is getting old.  Almost identical in content to 1986's MANHUNTER save the very beginning and Hollywood cookie cutter ending, RED DRAGON is merely there.  Manhunter was the better film and BRIAN COX deserves more credit for basically inventing the LECTOR character for film by paving the way for HOPKINS tour de force in LAMBS. Although both performances excellent, it was nice to see two different takes on the same psycho. The canibal has now pretty much been turned into a mockery of himself and the 'franchise' needs to take the vacation DR. CHILTON did.</p></body></html>

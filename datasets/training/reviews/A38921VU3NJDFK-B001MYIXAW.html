I can't think of a better parallel: Each film is as graceful and authoritatively affecting; and just as Beehive faintly honors the grandeur of the story and heartbreak of Frankenstein, so does Let the Right One In tribute the entire lore of vampires and the corresponding stories of its written and spoken history through gentle underscores in the film's own narrative. As you've heard -- and as you will always hear from anyone who's seen it -- Let the Right One In is only a vampire horror picture on the outside; beneath its surface is an intricate, deeply intimate, and ironically life-avowing story of love (not only of the romantic bond between one individual and another, but of a deep passion for the nature of people and things as they relate to the development of the universe). A staggering film. Film grade: 10/10.<br /><br />DVD/Blu-ray: The first (and only, thus far) print of Let the Right One In, from distributor Magnet, is a product that should be avoided indefinitely. In their attempt to make a "more pure" translation of the film's original English subtitles, those at Magnet have doubtless loosened its tension and lessened its overall impact. Magnet has been promising a reprint of the product since April of 2009, though has not made any progress in either detailing its projected release or confirming distribution.<br /><br />Because of Let the Right One In's caliber as a motion picture -- one strong enough to survive a moderate subtitle issue, but one that will increase drastically once the issue has been resolved -- and its ghostly availability in its theatrical form, viewers too eager to see it before its indeterminate re-release won't be completely wasting their money by purchasing this product. But they will certainly need to re-purchase the corrected print if they wish to enjoy the film in its original state.</p></body></html>

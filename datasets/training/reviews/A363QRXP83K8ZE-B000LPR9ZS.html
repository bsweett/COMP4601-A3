<meta name="summary" content="Serial killer with a lot of stagehands"></head><body><p>Saw II is that rare horror movie that is just as good if not better than the original.  Depending on what you thought of Saw, Saw II looks to be about as demented, and makes about as much sense as Saw.<br /><br />The film opens with another hapless fool waking up in another music-video-leftover room with another insane device attached to his head.  The serial killer Jigsaw (who has never killed anyone) informs him via video that he has about a minute to cut out his eyeball to retrieve a key to unlock the venus-flytrap device on his head.  Argh!  From there we are introduced to a weary cop with family troubles who is being personally called out by Jigsaw.  Before long, we find out that Jigsaw has kidnapped his son, along with a bunch of other idiots and placed them in a booby trapped house with poison gas being pumped through the vents and a time limit for them to endure sick, twisted, horror-movie-traps and tests in order to prove how badly they want to live.<br /><br />Don't think too closely about this one, as by the end it makes even less sense than the twist of the original.  And yes, there is a twist of sorts.  The movie looks like the original, meaning it looks like a Nine Inch Nails video and has all the editing of the ADD school of filmmaking which is now apparently a pre-req for making at least 50% of movies.  The ridiculous editing is getting out of hand now---why do they feel the need to TELL you visually that it's time to get tense, or scared?  Are the filmmakers too uneasy about the material and their ability to just rely on the situation, the script, the actors?  Do I need to see crack head editing and lights and that over-produced dirt and grime in every movie in order to feel anything?<br /><br />These movies are not scary in the least, masking a lack of imagination in the horror/fear department, but plenty of imagination in the 'how else can they die' department.  Cruelty and tastelessness are the new horror genre checkpoints, I guess it's a lot easier than creating genuine scares or fear.  How about babies in a blender, that'd be a good horror flick.  These films can be demented fun for 90 minutes and can be a lot of fun in a crowded movie theater, but they're overdone and over-stylized.  The visuals don't show you as much as tell you (with the same lighting, editing, colors) that this is a horror film.  The moral 'message' of the killer, or the writers, is perhaps the real reason this is a horror film.<br /><br />Plenty of extras about the making of the film and the traps, all the work that goes into this madness, new ways to torture and kill people, and other wonders.  It's always nice to see that artistic, creative people can make a living designing torture contraptions for fictitious serial killers (fictitious today, that is), and that those serial killers become 'beloved' characters to American audiences.  There's a 2 DVD set out there as well, though this single disc unrated widescreen edition should suffice for most folks.  I would bet the house that Saw becomes a video game or a series of them, the possibilities for interactive sadism are too much for them not to hybridize Saw.<br /><br />Followed by Saw III.  And IV.  Box set coming...</p></body></html>

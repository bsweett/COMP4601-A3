<meta name="summary" content="Terrific film with terrific acting"></head><body><p>A rookie, Ethan Hawke, having completed 19 months on the police force decides, with marked trepidation, to join the narcotics unit. He spends a terrible, enlightening, and frightening day under the tutelage of Denzel Washington, who turns out to be a rogue cop who is pursued by the Russian mob, and who they threaten to kill unless he gives them one million dollars. Both Hawke and Washington are splendid in the film, which has a quick-moving plot, lots of drama, and violence. Washington won his second academy award for his acting in this film as a bad person, rather than his usual good guy image.<br /><br />Hawke undergoes many experiences during his day with Washington, including, among much else, being forced to take drugs and alcohol, letting criminals go free, stealing from them, breaking and entering, robbery, and murder. He is almost killed several times.<br /><br />It is interesting to watch Washington violate the system and ignore the interests of people he was sworn to protect and Hawke's reactions to what he sees and participates in.<br /><br />The film has a somewhat obscure ending, leaving us to decide for ourselves exactly how Hawke acted at the end. However the DVD has an alternative ending in which this issue is clear. I liked both endings.</p></body></html>

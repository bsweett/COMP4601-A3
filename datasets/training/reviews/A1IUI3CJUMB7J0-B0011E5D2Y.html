<meta name="summary" content="A funny movie with great acting but losses it in the last half hour"></head><body><p>I enjoyed this film but I did not find it the best comadey of the year like most people are saying. Yeas this movie is good and hallariouse at times but it's the acting that makes this movie good. Vince Vaughn is great and steels all the scens's I felt really bad for him in this movie, Owen Wilson is funny, Rachel McAddems is great and is a rising star, it's the crazy girlfriend that steals all the scene's. The bad thing is the last half hour when Will Ferell makes a cameo, the last half hour is slow and stupid till the last part of the movie when everything comes together. Overall plenty of laugh out loud moments makes this a great movie that you can watch again and again.</p></body></html>

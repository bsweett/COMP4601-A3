<meta name="summary" content="Not really scary at all"></head><body><p>Remakes have been done time and time again, let's face it. But it seems kind of rare for a film to actually be re-created by the original director and have almost shot-for-shot imagery from the original. And so it is with the Grudge, an american production shot in Japan with the original director of Ju-On, where the source comes from. While it seems kind of creepy, it was kind of bad bordering on stale.<br /><br />As we're told in the beginning, if a person dies in the grip of a powerful emotion, then it'll bring a curse on whoever comes near and consume them. So in this case, it's a house, anyone who sets foot in a japanese house is basically haunted by these 2 kids: Toshio, a kid who can screech like a cat which borders on irritating than scary and Kayako, a teenage girl who has this weird vocal thing going on.<br /><br />The story is told very non-linear(chronologically) so we start with the death of a character than go to a character's rendezvous with the curse in the house. Then jump into the past for more people. Then back to present and we actually uncover why the curse started and what drove the first character's death and we also get the end of the present's story at the same time.<br /><br />As for the "scares", they're not really that scary. The best scares always comes when it seems like there's nothing on screen then there is. A lot of these you can actually pinpoint before they happen like the attic scare or the under the covers ones. But in a scene that almost seems straight out of the Ring, one of the girls appears in a surveillance video seemingly coming out of the ground. That was more creepy than it's "jumps"(although to be honest, when you see the end of the tape, it got ruined for me).<br /><br />The performances as you can expect are average. Nothing completely inspired but at least they do a good job at getting the images across. Rent it for your date and see if they'll get scared but you'll probably be creeped out less than the date, if they get freaked out at all.</p></body></html>

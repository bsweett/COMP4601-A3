<meta name="summary" content="Scorsese needs more people to reality-check him..."></head><body><p>Meh.  This is a painfully heavyhanded, broadly played, on-the-nose, over-the-top dud.  Scorsese just can't help himself, can he?  I recall reading reviews of this film which concentrated on Daniel Day Lewis's supposedly delicious turn as a villain -- but his role was one of the central weak points the film, and was, in all honesty, just a rehash of the same old, tired, badguy schtick that Robert DeNiro does with equally belabored relentlessness.  Anyway, a potentially fascinating story -- of the outlandishly violent, corrupt gangs that ran New York City in the later 1800s -- is ruined by Scorsese's blunt, pointlessly aggressive direction and a remarkably unsubtle script.  You can practically hear him goading the actors on keep "giving more" and indulging their hammiest impulses.  Thus, the film is drowned in a deluge of overly-obvious violence, cheap melodrama and garish visual design.  If done right, this could have been a masterpiece.  As is, it's a real stinker.  Wish I'd skipped it.</p></body></html>

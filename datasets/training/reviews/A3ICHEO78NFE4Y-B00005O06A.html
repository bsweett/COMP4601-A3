<meta name="summary" content="Great film"></head><body><p>I viewed this film this past weekend and i'm ashamed to say that i had never seen it before.  The acting was the best, story telling, music, design of the movie was all wonderful.  I realize that this film is rated the "Best of Hollywood" and i can understand why.  My only fault that i see with this film, and it might just be me, but i don't think it's a film you could watch over and over again.  But don't let that stop you from really enjoying and great piece of work and i'm so glad i finally know who "Rosebud" was.  Great work of Americana!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Trite plot punched up by funny gags & Zooey Deschanel"></head><body><p>During the first half, it seemed Failure To Launch was just another variation of the most cliche formula in Hollywood:  A deceptive relationship in which the deceiver falls in love with her (or his) victim, but he finds out she's phony before she can tell him the truth.  Well, that is the story in a nutshell, but Zooey Deschanel rescues the movie from triteness in the first half, and enough funny, relatively original gags and plot twists bring it to a satisfying conclusion.  However, some bits are just variations from other recent films, and not recommended for the whole family - like the retired father standing around naked once he gets the house to himself.  I'll give it 4 stars because on the whole it kept me interested and amused from start to finish, and I see a lot of movies - most don't.</p></body></html>

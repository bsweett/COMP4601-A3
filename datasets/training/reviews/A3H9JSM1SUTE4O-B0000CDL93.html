<meta name="summary" content="FACT OR FICTION: A SUPERB THRILLER"></head><body><p>Oliver Stone's films are being re-released in definitive DVD editions with commentary and extras. The masterpiece of the lot is his controversial take on the 1963 assassination of President Kennedy. This terrific two-disc set includes a riveting and highly detailed audio track by writer/director Stone as well as 17 added minutes to the now 223 minute feature. In Disc B, there's a collection of deleted and extended scenes with optional commentary by Stone and multimedia essays that update the assassination. <p>I was in Dallas on the eve of that fateful day. I remember an eerie, blood-red moon hanging over the flower-strewn grassy knoll at midnight. Later, I spoke to a baffled policeman who was running beside the President's car.  I heard many bizarre stories regarding the immediate aftermath of the events of that day including a witness, a local weatherman on WFAA, who claimed he saw Ruby and Oswald together at Dealy Plaza 24 hours before the death of JFK. Like Stone observes, "Once you enter the rabbit hole, there's no coming back." This gripping mystery-thriller stands on its own as a great piece of technical filmmaking whether fact or fiction (or both). Stone's incredible commentary raises the drama to a new level -- and is a valuable historical document. Cast includes Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Jack Lemmon, Donald Sutherland, Sissy Spacek, Kevin Bacon, and Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald. Oscar-winning cinematography and editing. Highly recommended. Rated R.</p></body></html>

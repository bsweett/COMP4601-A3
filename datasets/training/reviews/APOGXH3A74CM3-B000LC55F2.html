<meta name="summary" content="Storytelling Slight of Hand"></head><body><p>I've seen this movie a couple of times now and really enjoy it.  This cast does a great job and gives excellent performances, but what really makes this movie for me is how it's constructed.<br /><br />The story is told from overlapping points of view, one inside of another, an obsession within an obsession until the end.  The beginning from the end, a rough and sorry journey that is well thought out, and delivered in a manner that gives homage to the immortal world as it unfolded from from the pages of Bram Stoker's classic tale.  This gives this movie its real punch and makes it stand out from contemporary storytelling.</p></body></html>

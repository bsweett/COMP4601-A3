<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant social commentary."></head><body><p>I have two educated friends who saw this movie before I did and advised me not to see it because it was "terrible".  But I saw it anyway and I thought it was brilliant.  Those two friends are still my friends, but now I know not to take their advice on certain matters.<br /><br />"District 9" isn't a movie about aliens from outer space, though it does feature them.  It is a movie about xenophobia, Apartheid, corporate greed, and other real-life issues.<br /><br />"District 9" is a movie directed toward your social conscience and, in the end, your heart.  If you only see it as just another shoot-'em-up, blow-'em-up action film, then you are missing the point.  You may enjoy it for those elements too, but if you enjoy it JUST for those elements, then you probably need to learn a little bit more about the world around you to take this film in its proper social context.<br /><br />The special effects are top-notch, and I look forward to seeing this in either Blu-Ray format or even on regular DVD.<br /><br />******  December 23 addendum *********<br /><br />The Blu-Ray contains many bonus features, but not all of them are easy to see/read.  There are "MNU Files" on the aliens and the District 9 project, but the font is so small in the detail work that you can't really read them unless you put your face right up to the television.  If my Blu-ray player had a "Zoom" feature like my regular DVD player then I could manage, but it does not.<br /><br />Also, the subtitles are in white and superimposed on the film image itself.  That makes them hard to read sometimes.  Had they been in yellow they might be easier to read.  In the days before 16:9 TV sets, everyone watching a letterboxed film had black bars at top and bottom of screen, and those were where the subtitles usually were.  Less black bar space with 16:9 sets.</p></body></html>

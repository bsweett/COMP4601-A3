<meta name="summary" content="NOTLD: A Thin Wall Between Order and Chaos"></head><body><p>Those who have seen NOTLD usually claim that it is one of the scariest if not the scariest horror film of all time.  The reasons most often mentioned include the grainy black and white pseudo-documentary filming, the heretofore unbroken taboo of onscreen cannabalism, the bold decision to use a black man as the protagonist, and the dreary ordinariness of the zombies.  Certainly, the sum of these factors makes it easy to tag this film as something special in the horror genre.  Yet for NOTLD, the whole is somehow more than the sum of its parts.  There are other films in other genres that had talented directors consciously try tactics that would appeal to the immediate senses of the viewer.  What separates the merely effective film from the truly memorable one is what the director presents as lurking beneath the surface.  In the horror genre, Alfred Hitchcock is the acknowledged master of the subconscious demon that lurks in us all. George Romero, the director of NOTLD, surely runs a close second. What Romero manages to do in NOTLD is similar to what Ridley Scott managed a decade later in ALIEN.  Romero knew that walls and claustrophobia often interact on the screen to produce a creepy feeling in the audience.  In fact, walls and wall-breaking become the central metaphor of this film. As the movie opens, a zombie attacks a woman who seeks safety in her car.  The zombie tries to break in by smashing the car's window. The woman seeks safety in a house, and with the aid of other normal humans, seeks to buttress the structural integrity of the house by using nails and boards.  Soon enough a horde of slow-moving corpses tries to smash into the house.  Eventually they succeed. The grotestque climax occurs when the recently murdered brother of the woman reaches through a smashed door and drags his poor screaming sister out into the night to be devoured.  The cumulative impact of this scene scares the viewer on more than one level.  The horror of seeing a sister ripped apart by her ghoul brother is surely nasty enough, but Romero amplifies this grotesqueness by suggesting that the malevolent events of this movie are nothing more than an exaggeration of a fundamental principle of life--that the order and stability of this universe has only the thinnest of gossamer protection against the terror and chaos that exists just inches from that wall. It is almost as if Romero is suggesting that the nightmares which afflict us all are only glimpses into that anarchic nada which preceeded the origins of our universe.  If a nightmare glimpse scares the ordinary individual, then, he shows on the screen what the grim reality of a wall collapse must be like.  This other nightmare universe sucks us into its foul regions where the dead are not dead at all.  By the end of the film, the audience is forced to see that the dramatic focus of the title is not on the living at all, but on the dead.  And it is this soul-shaking divination that causes a new generation of audiences to continually reappraise the sometimes elusive distinction between that which is dead and that which is not.</p></body></html>

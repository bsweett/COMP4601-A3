Frasier stars as Trevor Anderson, a college professor who teaches plate tectonics and volcanism.  He is kidded by his colleagues because he only has two students in his class.  Ten years earlier, Trevor's brother went off to prove that the assumptions made by Verne in his novel were actually true.  Trevor has also agreed to take in his nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) for the summer.  Trevor share his beliefs about the center of the earth with Sean.  Soon, the two are off to Iceland to track down a possible entry to the center of the earth.<br /><br />Once in Iceland, Sean and Trevor meet Hannah (Anita Briem).  Hannah is the daughter of a dead Icelandic professor whom Trevor's brother was working with.  It is possible that the two may have indeed found the entryway described by Verne.  Hannah agrees to be Trevor's guide and take him to the possible entry site.  Once there, Trevor discovers a piece of scientific apparatus and retrieves it, but a severe lightning storm strikes, forcing Trevor to drop the apparatus and run to the safety of a nearby cave.  Unfortunately, Trevor, Hannah, and Sean are trapped when a large rockslide covers the entrance, but they did indeed find the entrance to the center of the earth, for soon, they are careening down an abandoned mineshaft in coal cars.  Then, they fall through a thin layer of rock and, just as in Verne's novel, find themselves at the center of the earth.<br /><br />But, once there, Hannah makes a sobering discovery; she find's Trevor's deceased brother.  After burying him, Trevor, Hannah, and Sean must find a way back to the surface before the underground temperature gets too hot.  Along the way, they encounter some nasty sea creatures, a very scary T-Rex, and some hungry carnivorous plants.  Their only hope is to reach a vent which leads to the surface, but this vent is located on the far side of a vast underwater ocean.  Will the three adventurers make it before its too late?<br /><br />This is an excellent movie.  Brendan Frasier is excellent in his role, and Josh Hutcherson and Anita Briem are very good as well.  The special effects are first-rate, and there are several exciting moments in the movie, including the T-Rex chase, the journey across the underground ocean, and the thrilling ride in the mine cars.<br /><br />I give this great movie my highest recommendation.  It does a good job of combining adventure and comedy.  Viewers familiar with Jules Verne's story will surely enjoy this fine movie.</p></body></html>

When I first heard the title of this film and saw the teeny bopper cast from the promos, I was pretty sure this film would be a waste of time. But, then a funny thing happened. I started to hear from friends who said Jeepers Creepers was really scary and I read an endorsement on the newspaper ad from the &quot;master&quot; Clive Barker who said &quot;...The Scariest Film I've Seen in Years.&quot; That was enough for me. The film doesn't waste much time getting right into the plot which is good. The plot is also very basic, a brother and sister driving home along the backroads from college. They are menaced off the road by a maniac in an old fashioned car. After surviving the scare of their lives, the loony drives away and the kids think all is well. As they continue driving they spot the maniac's truck at an abandoned old church. They see the guy chucking what appears to be bodies into a sewer drain. The story progresses well from here incorporating elements of the supernatural and standard horror. The director of Jeepers Creepers is the true star of the film. You can tell he is an avid fan of the genre and knows exactly what buttons to push to scare the hell out of you. The last scene is pretty grizzly but one that will stick with you every time you mention the film hereafter. Overall, great direction and some scary moments add up to a worthy addition to any horror collection.</p></body></html>

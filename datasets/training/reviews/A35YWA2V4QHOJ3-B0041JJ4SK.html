<meta name="summary" content="Hey, I liked it!"></head><body><p>This is the best party movie I've seen in quite awhile.  It has all the main ingredients you look for in a party movie;  plenty of laughs, gratuitous nudity & zany good times.<br /><br />Our heroes find themselves craving White Castle burgers after getting stoned.  It does not sound like too big a deal to get to the burger joint, but their trip turns into one filled with so many quaint twists & turns that it turns into a miniature version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXIY">Road Trip (Unrated Edition)</a>!<br /><br />The funniest part of the movie was their run-in with a creepy tow-truck driver, aptly named "Freakshow."  While some of it was a bit predictable, it was humorous nonetheless.  The cameo by Neil Patrick Harris (AKA:  Doogie Howser) was cute as well.<br /><br />While I'm never big on movies that aggrandize getting high, I'm willing to make an exception in this case.  If you're into the party movie genre @ all, this one is worth a look!</p></body></html>

The success of the film (modest box office hit, Oscar wins for Best Movie and Directing) garnered four sequels of varying quality before the franchise was put in hiatus for 17 years. But, now, at last, the 60-year-old Stallone, feeling his oats again and desiring one last hurrah, brings to a close the Rocky Balboa saga.<br /><br />SPOILERS and a few boxing trivia follow here: If you're any sort of boxing fan, then you know that the heavyweight class has been in steady decline for a number of years now; it's just been fairly recently that Wladimir Klitschko has been imposing his dominance over the sundry contenders/pretenders. ROCKY BALBOA borrows from the real-life lack of an undisputed, linear heavyweight champ and transposes it somewhat onto its movie premise. In the plot, undefeated and current heavyweight champion Mason "the Line" Dixon (real life light heavyweight pugilist Antonio Tarver) has been knocking out his opponents for a while now but, because of the lack of depth in his weight class and the absence of a fighter who could truly test him, he's considered to be a dubious champion by fans and boxing pundits. Even an ESPN computer simulation refuses to show him respect as it pits him versus a past champion in Rocky Balboa; to add insult to injury, the computer even has Balboa knocking out Dixon. Dixon's manager, who is well aware of his client's prevailing unpopularity, hits on the idea of putting on an exhibition match between Dixon (33 wins, 0 losses, 30 knockouts) and Rocky Balboa (57 wins, 22 losses, 28 knockouts). And, speaking of Rocky...<br /><br />With the loss of his wife and anchor, Adrian, to cancer, ex-prizefighter Rocky Balboa, now 58 years in age, has basically been just drifting. He spends much of his time missing Adrian and, every year, on the anniversary of her passing, he frequents their old hangouts, much to the distress and disgust of his brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young), who is as unpolitically correct and irascible as ever. Rocky owns and runs Adrian's, a nice, little Italian restaurant, and amuses the customers by regaling them with his fight experiences and accomodating them with photo ops. When Rocky catches a glimpse of the same virtual match on ESPN, his aged motor gets going; he begins to mull over the idea of re-entering the ring and fighting in small, local bouts. Somehow, against everyone's wishes (including and especially his overshadowed son, Robert), he's even granted a boxing license. Dixon's manager and promoter approach him with the offer to fight a 10-round exhibition bout (but with no protective gear) with the current champ; this  challenge proves to be too much for Rocky to resist as he still harbors a "beast" inside of him.<br /><br />The rest of the movie goes on to depict the by now expected montage of training sessions - including the traditional sprint up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art - and culminates in the highly anticipated match, where Rocky is considered a massive underdog. Even with the fans solidly behind him and chanting out his name, Rocky is hard pressed to beat a champion who's reigning and defending his crown in the prime of his life. In the end, as usual, it goes down to heart, as Mason Dixon finally finds the defining test he's been looking for and Rocky seeks to tame the savage beast within him one final time. I won't say who wins, but let me put it this way: Rocky exits on his own terms.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa is, without a doubt, the quintessential underdog, and, obviously, is one of the most universally beloved cinematic creations of our time. The city of Philadelphia has taken the Rocky character on as one of its very own citizens. Rocky, for 30 years now, has simply resonated within the souls of the populace and it's easy to see why. The man isn't too bright, though he does have a certain street savvy and has become wiser over the years. He's innately lovable - a big palooka who works hard and is intrinsically true to himself. He's very rootable. In ROCKY BALBOA, Stallone returns his iconic character to his roots, the seamy neighborhoods of Philly peopled with blue-collared Joes. This film is predominantly a series of low key character-driven scenes, one after the other, punched up, every now and then, by Balboa's occasional impassioned speeches (you could see Sly straining for the Oscar), until the big, showy brawl at the end. We get to hear and ponder Rocky's gravelly, ineloquently vocalized homespun philosophies and realize that, while Rocky's no brain surgeon, he's smart enough to know what matters most in life, a nugget of wisdom he imparts to his unfulfilled and whiny son, as played annoyingly by the plastically smouldering Milo Ventimiglia (who also isn't exactly my most favorite character in HEROES), whose turnaround to his father's side happens too rapidly for my taste. Yes, the pace is deliberate and, at times, threatens to plod. A lot of the flashbacks shown in the first half hour will certainly test the patience of folks unaware of the Rocky history. I even found some of the old clips too much to take as I wanted the movie to advance already. But, in the end, Sly knew what he was doing as these quiet moments do serve to make Rocky's last time in the ring heartachingly more resonant.<br /><br />The other actors aren't shabby. Burt Young inhabits Paulie from such a deep, personal place that I really can't picture him in any other kind of role. Antonio Tarver (who, by the by, after this movie, went on to decisively lose his very next bout to the elderly, blown-up heavyweight Bernard Hopkins) is decent enough as Rocky's boxing foil, although the script doesn't really call for him to stretch as an actor. Geraldine Hughes takes over Jodi Letizia's role as Little Marie, who reappears after 30 years. Little Marie was the girl who told Rocky, "Screw you, creepo!" after he walked her safely home; this time, she has more of an integral role to play. Marie, apparently, didn't listen to Rocky's advise from way back and has become a single mom with very low self-esteem. We'll never know if a romance will develop between her and Rocky but we are assured of a blooming friendship between the two. Hughes' deft portrayal of the wounded Marie makes you wish good things to happen for her. Unfortunately, not much can be said of the actor who plays her son, Steps, as the audience never really gets a chance to know him.<br /><br />It was nice to see actual folks in the flick who are major players in the world of boxing. Credibility is lent with the appearances of ESPN's Brian Kenny (who's had his own verbal battles with Floyd Mayweather, Jr.), the HBO boxing commentary crew (Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant, Max Kellerman), announcer Michael Buffer ("Let's get ready to rumble!"), ref Joe Cortez (who really does say "Remember, guys, I'm fair but I'm firm"), promoter Lou Dibella, and the cigar toting boxing historian Bert Sugar.<br /><br />Of course, this movie ain't perfect. The plot tends to drag at times, not enough time is spent working on Mason Dixon's character (although his relationship with his former trainer proves to be surprisingly touching), and I find it vexing that not one mention is made about the brain damage Rocky incurred in ROCKY V.<br /><br />So is ROCKY BALBOA as good as the first ROCKY? No, not by a mile. But, while it doesn't live up to my high expectations, it certainly contains enough graceful moments which affected me at a deep enough gut level that I can honestly recommend it. Needless to say, this movie is best experienced in a rambunctiously crowded theater with folks who are all in the know about the Rocky films. I guarantee you ROCKY BALBOA'll serve up a nice, warm slug of nostalgia. Like I said, the movie's pace is leisurely so take the time to savor the scenes as there won't be any more after this. ROCKY BALBOA is a fitting capper to what has been an iconic film series. By the way, in an interview on a radio sports show, Stallone made mention that he would like another crack at John Rambo with the intention of making the next movie more character driven as well, as opposed to the last two action oriented sequels. If he can revive Rambo as well as he did ROCKY BALBOA, then count me in.</p></body></html>

It probably will never have a sequel.<p>So, why did I give it four stars?<p>Simple, I had fun.  I was not expecting a masterpiece.  I wasn't even expecting to like it much, but I was pleasantly surprized.  Almost from the beginning I enjoyed Sean Connery's character.  It helped that I like him and that I saw KING SOLOMON'S MINES several years ago.  Then I started playing at identifying as many lines from various books as I could find.  Then I just sort of got into it.  If I compared it to professional sports I'd have to say that it certainly wasn't the Super Bowl, perhaps more like all star wrestling.  Then again, out of all the sporting events I've been to, one night ring side at an all star wrestling event stands out as my all time most fun.<p>RECOMMENDATION:  Don't expect THE LORD OF THE RINGS or STAR WARS. Losen up and have fun with it and you will find an enjoyable movie.  Pop some popcorn and laugh as you watch it with a friend.</p></body></html>

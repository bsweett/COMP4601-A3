<meta name="summary" content="An Okay Way to Spend Two Hours...James & Mendes Shine!"></head><body><p>Will Smith will always be Will Smith in his movies. His personality is getting old to me, but thankfully Kevin James (the new John Candy) and Eva Mendes (she has the you can't take your eyes off her exotic look...smoking hot!) save this film. Most of the funny scenes are the ones you see in the previews and the funniest of them all is the second dance scene that happens right before the end credits. This is a great date film that most guys will enjoy too. A little happy-sappy in parts, but there is enough relationship humor to keep it interesting.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"></head><body><p>Lately, it seems, if you're looking for remake fodder, Scandinavian cinema is where it's at. Christopher Nolan mined Norway for Insomnia, and Matt Reeves went to Sweden for Let Me In, both of which turned out to be rousing successes. Enter David Fincher, who last year helmed the American version of another Swedish property, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, an adaptation of Stieg Larsson's global bestseller of the same name, and came out with a great hit of his own. The story, for those unfamiliar, revolves around a disgraced journalist who enlists the help of a rebellious young hacker in hopes of unraveling the mystery behind a decades-old missing persons case; as they dig deeper, they uncover a vast conspiracy with far-reaching implications. With material here that fits squarely within his wheelhouse, Fincher succeeds in translating the Swedish hit for American audiences, complete with all the lurid details, the unabashed brutality, and the wholly committed performance from his lead actress.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Well Done, But Definitely Not Spielberg's Best"></head><body><p>When one considers the plight of Jews portrayed on film, nothing compares to Mr. Spielberg's "Schindler's List." And though this was a story that needed to be told, I can think of other Spielberg films that were somehow, more rewarding. "Jaws" "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" "E.T." "The Color Purple" "Saving Private Ryan" and even "Amistad."<br /><br />I can remember quite vividly, the tragic events that destroyed the whole meaning of World Unity, that were supposed to be the 1972 Olympic Games. I was 17, and trying to find meaning to life at the time. But rather than concentrating on the acts of revenge, I would rather have seen more character development, especially of the members of the Israeli Olympic team, and their life stories leading up to Munich. In some ways, I think the fascination with vengeance could be counterproductive to the future peace of Israel. Sad as that may sound. The impact and effect of viewing "Munich" still rates 4 stars though.</p></body></html>

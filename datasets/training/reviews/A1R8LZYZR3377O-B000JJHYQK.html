<meta name="summary" content="Very average."></head><body><p>Michael Douglas trys hard as a secret service agent who appears to be framed. Kiefer Sutherland plays a co worker whos suspicious of him as he projects credible acting. Kim Bassinger as the typical frail, shaken first lady is a bore. That would basically sum it up. I was expecting more mystery and action and was disapointed on both. I can not find anything further to say about this film, and thats whats known as average. Destined for the back shelf . Oh, I came up with one more thing. The movie was full of camera jutting along with quick cuts in and out of scenes at an attempt to give big screen splendour. Great audio and picture quality .</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Sky Captain"...a blast of thrills on the grandest scale!!"></head><body><p>I have seen the highly anticipated "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" at the theaters for the second time in a row, and the film was nothing short of amazing! It was like nothing that I've ever seen in a film before until now, especially since "Sky Captain" has lots of action and thrills that never let up for a minute! The direction of first-time director Kerry Conran was magnificient! The performances of superstars Jude Law ("Cold Mountain") and Gwyneth Paltrow ("A Perfect Murder") were outstanding and top-notch! (The last time that Law and Paltrow appeared in a film together was in 1999's "The Talented Mr. Ripley", with Matt Damon.) Joining them are Oscar-winner Angelina Jolie (The "Tomb Raider" films), Giovanni Ribisi ("Flight of the Phoenix"), Michael Gambon ("Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"), and Bai Ling ("Red Corner") in which they gave great performances as well.<br /><br />"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" focuses on an intrepid reporter named Polly Perkins (Paltrow). Polly discovers that famous scientists are disappearing from around the world. During an encounter with one of the potential victims, there are a bunch of giant robots parading across the streets, destroying everything in their way. Polly sees the scientists' disappearances and the attacks of the robots as some sort of a connection, and she teams up with her old flame/avation officer Joe "Sky Captain" Sullivan (Law), the captain of a mercenary legion of pilots. Joe and Polly are investigating the case when the robots attack the city yet again, though in a stroke of luck, Joe/Sky Captain's right-hand man, Dex (Ribisi), manages to locate the source of the strange goings-on. Joe and Polly then travel around the world to find the evil Dr. Totenkopf (played by the late Sir Laurence Olivier, in a cameo via manipulated video footage), who is bent on creating a utopia of his own, a "World of Tomorrow", and destroy the world of today! And the world's only hope lies in the hands of Joe and Polly, along with the help of Joe's comrade, Capt. Franky Cook (Jolie), as they try to thwart Totenkopf's evil plans before it's the end of the world for them!<br /><br />Jude Law, who plays the title character with charming, silk-scarf nonchalance, is likely to linger in the memory with the staying power of Indiana Jones. Gwyneth Paltrow's Polly Perkins character, however, has the makings of a Lois Lane-type character with enduring appeal. In their own ways, the characters are interchangeable with the appliances they battle, each a collection of attitudes and foibles. (Joe cricks his neck manfully before engaging in combat; Polly is prone to pouting as an expression of sexual tension.) But while they are busy saving the world -- an assignment that takes them to Nepal, Shangri-La, and beneath the sea -- Paltrow and Law fit snugly and happily in front of the bluescreen on which director Conran and his production designer (and brother), Kevin Conran, have built their entirely CG dream universe, in which actual sets are obsolete. And when Law and Paltrow are joined by Angelina Jolie, sporting a kinky black eye patch and a fetish-compatible tight uniform as Capt. Franky Cook, the confection is irresistible: three of Hollywood's most polished stars, assuming the contours of 2-D characters without irony or condescension.<br /><br />And they never forget their silver-screen roots. "I'm late for a movie," Polly tells her editor (Gambon, in a sly tip of the felt brim to his noir masterpiece, "The Singing Detective") as she hurries off to an interview a source at Radio City Music Hall. On the Music Hall screen, Dorothy is just realizing that she's not in Kansas anymore. This couldn't have happened; "The Wizard of Oz" never played in Radio City, another smooshing of fact and fiction, as is having the late Laurence Olivier "play" the evil wizard Dr. Totenkopf through the magic of pixels. Indeed, for all the grandeur of "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" visible on screen, hidden in behind-the-scenes technical specs, and audible in the stirring, enveloping score of Edward Shearmur, it's the little, low-tech grace notes that stand out. I love that Dex, Sky Captain's trusty, tinkering sidekick, chews gum like an all-American boy. That Polly's charm bracelet becomes a liability. And that Frank barks "Alert the Amphibious Squad!" Ooh, yes, please do! we reply, bouncing with happiness.<br /><br />In conclusion, "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" has it all: thrilling action, laugh-out-loud humor, an excellent plot, groundbreaking special and visual effects, and a great soundtrack as well! This is Jude Law's best film since "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence" and "Cold Mountain"; Gwyneth Paltrow's best film since "Shallow Hal" and "A Perfect Murder"; and Angelina Jolie's best film since the "Tomb Raider" films and "Gone in 60 Seconds". Truly a DVD must-have when released, there will be no other film quite like "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"!</p></body></html>

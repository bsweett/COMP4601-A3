<meta name="summary" content="Well Deserved Oscar"></head><body><p>This is a wonderful little fairy tale about a boy who lives in the slums of Bombay and makes it to the top via Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? The movie mixes images of the show in the present and the flashbacks of the protagonist's horrible life. Everything is perfectly timed unlike real life but reality isn't the point of this movie.  This is a type of Rocky where a slum boy makes good.</p></body></html>

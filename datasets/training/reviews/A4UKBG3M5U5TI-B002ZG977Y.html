After a massive statue of Zeus (Liam Neeson) is dumped into the ocean, Zeus' brother, Hades (Ralph Fiennes), takes vengeance on the perpetrators, killing a family of innocent bystanders.  The family includes the parents and sister of Perseus (Sam Worthington), who becomes our protagonist.  Hades (who feeds off the fear and hatred of mankind) convinces Zeus (who basks in the love of mankind) to teach the silly humans a lesson.  Zeus reluctantly agrees, and Hades begins a war upon the Kingdom of Argos.  Only Perseus can prevent the destruction of Argos and save mankind.<br /><br />"Clash of the Titans" is a bit silly at times, and like many movies of its ilk, it relies on an overly complicated back story that is related as a prologue.  It's easy to lose interest and get lost before the story even gets started.  However, the story here is not really that important when it comes right down to it.  That'd be the sword fights, battles, and special effects.  For an early summer popcorn movie, "Clash of the Titans" is above average.  In particular, the special effects are quite well done without being overly fussy, especially the horrific monster, Kracken.<br /><br />How does it compare to the original 1981 film on which it is based?  The 1981 version has become a bit of a camp classic, replete with horrible acting and even worse special effects.  However, it's also a rather fun movie (although I haven't seen it since I was a teenager).  I'd say that this new version is less fun but much better directed and acted.  Ralph Fiennes is actually quite good as Hades, even if his role consists mostly of appearing and then dissipating as a cloud of black smoke.  I also liked the character of Io (Gemma Arterton) - Perseus's benevolent protector.  Sam Worthington is not a particularly good action hero for me; he's a bit too bland and boring.  However, he can act rings around the original Perseus, Harry Hamlin.  I'd call the battle of the "Clashes" a draw.  I did miss the mechanical owl, Bubo (look fast for his cameo!), but many people will find his absence a blessing.  Incidentally, the movie was not available in 3-D in my area, so this review is for the 2-D version.</p></body></html>

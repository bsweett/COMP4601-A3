<meta name="summary" content="A student film run amuck"></head><body><p>First of all...how did this film get made?  I mean, the actors don't even bother to act.  It looks like and sounds like a group of friends got together over one too many drinks and brainstormed this whole thing.  And good for them if they were able to get on the phone and convince a bunch of idiots to give them money to make it.  However, I think it's equally important to have a few drinks in you too in order to get the right buzz required to enjoy this film.</p></body></html>

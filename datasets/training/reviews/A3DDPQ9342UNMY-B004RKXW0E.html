<meta name="summary" content="Abandoned toys make their great escape in film that exceeds expectations..."></head><body><p>If ever there was a film that exceeds all expectations it's Pixar's TOY STORY 3, a movie with the familiar cast headed by TOM HANKS and TIM ALLEN as Woody and Buzz Lightyear, respectively, featuring the further adventures of the toy gang everyone fell in love with after the first smash hit.<br /><br />The toys are accidentally abandoned when Andy's mom is helping him pack for college. They end up dumped unceremoniously at a daycare center for kids whom the toys think will appreciate and play with them just as Andy did--with tender, loving care.<br /><br />As they discover on their first day in the playroom, these kids are a nightmare with toys. Woody resolves to return to his owner's attic while the others stay behind until they must plan their great escape. What happens next is unpredictable from start to finish, the only certainty being that there will be a happy ending--which gives the story a final tug on the heartstrings with a poignant and tender conclusion.<br /><br />This is animation that is beyond clever, as imaginative as a film of this kind can get, masterfully staged and brilliantly animated. It's also a bit scary at times since all of the characters almost meet their final destiny a number of times, long before the story is over, thanks to a villainous plush toy bear called Lotso, wonderfully voiced by Ned Beatty, hug-gable on the surface but a scoundrel at the core.<br /><br />Since all the technical stuff is beyond reproach, there's no reason why TOY STORY 3 shouldn't please fans of the first two in this series. It even exceeds expectations with a story of depth, compassion and humor that gets better as it goes along.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

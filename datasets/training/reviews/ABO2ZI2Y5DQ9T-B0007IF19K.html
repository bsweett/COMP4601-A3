<meta name="summary" content="See Jamie Foxx's Powerful and Heartfelt Performance"></head><body><p>Jamie Foxx is Ray Charles.  That's what you would feel after watching Taylor Hackford's bio-pic of late Ray Charles.  Not only Foxx moves like Ray, with his characteristic, jerky body movements, but he represents the soul of the great musician himself.<br /><br />Despite the long running time (more than 150 minutes), the film never shows lull, covering the life of Ray Charles from his childhood to the stardom.  Despite the too familiar ways of showing the psychological aspects of his life, the film is skillfully edited, and shows his genius as musician and strong will for success, both of which are no surprising matters.  Made with the artist's own  saction, the film is fairly honest about the negative sides of his personality -- about use of substance, womanizing habits, and dubious judgements influenced by money.  But they are also part of Ray.<br /><br />[MUSIC] But the film's greatest strength lies in the interpretation of Ray Charles' music, or how his style came to be what it is.  It is easy for anyone to portray him as genius, but the director knows rightly that his talent lies in innovation -- fusing gospel music with rhythmn and blues.  And 'Ray' presents us the innovator's way of thinking, or inspiration, by cleverly putting his classic songs in the context of his own history.  How and where did he think of 'I Got a Woman'?  How did people (including his future wife) respond to it?  The music history is never so accurately and succinctly interpreted as in 'Ray.'<br /><br />For all the hit songs like 'Georgia on My Mind' or 'I Can't Stop Loving You,' the film suggests that the culmination of Ray Charles's career is 'What'd I Say.'  The whole film is great, of course, but that scene showing the birth of that song (my favorite) alone deserves 5 star rating.  At that moment, the music gets irresistible.  From there, the film's latter half is slightly weak, for after all, Ray Charles sitting behind the executive's desk is much less attractive Ray Charles singing in a travelling band.<br /><br />But all the actors, especially Jamie Foxx and Sharon Warren as Ray's mother are so memorable that you won't just stop watching it.  My only complaint is that Taylor Hackford should not have let Foxx take off the glasses at one scene -- you will know where -- in which he looks like not Ray, but Jamie Foxx, for he revels his own eyes.  You know, Foxx has eyes that remind us of puppy, and in that scene only he stops being Ray.<br /><br />But for all its small flaws, 'Ray' will remain in your mind as a great tribute to Ray Charles and his music.  Watch and listen to it.</p></body></html>

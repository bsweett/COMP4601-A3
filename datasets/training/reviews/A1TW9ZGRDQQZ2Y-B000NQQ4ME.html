<meta name="summary" content="Not quite worthy of five stars, but still very good"></head><body><p>This is just an interesting film to watch. With most people knowing little to nothing about the Mayan civilization, this film is an eye opener for just about everyone. The visuals, costumes, make-up, and acting are all so good you will often feel like you are watching actual history on film, rather than just another hollywood epic. Mel Gibson has crafted a movie that should be around come Oscar time, especially in the technical categories.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></body></html>

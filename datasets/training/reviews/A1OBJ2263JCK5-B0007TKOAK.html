Both these genres mesh together perfectly to create both big laughs and some sobering reflections about how people live their lives.<br /><br />In the film we meet two old friends. First there is Miles (Paul Giamatti) a schlumpy, depressed, middle aged, high school teacher and would-be novelist. He is also a wine connoiseur, who is using his hobby as a cover to get drunk and medicate his depression over his divorce from two years ago. His life is basically stuck in neutral. Then there is Jack (Thomas Haden Church) a handsome but shallow actor, who seems to do most of his thinking with his private parts. His addiction is women and he will say just about anything to get them into bed.<br /><br />As the film opens, Jack is about to get married. The two middle aged men embark on a "bachelor's week", vacation road trip, before the nupitals occur. Miles' plan is to go north from San Diego, visit a number of wineries for "tastings", have some good meals and take in a little golf. But Jack has other ideals, which are basically more carnal in nature. In their travels, they meet and pick-up, both Maya (Virginia Madsen) a local waitress (and fellow wine connoisseur) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh) a sexy winery employee. Romantic sparks fly and entanglements occur, that produce humor, hidden truths, and self-realizations for the characters.<br /><br />The Academy Award winning Script ("2005 Best writing, Adapted Screenplay") by Alexander Payne & Jim Taylor is both witty, funny and emotionally moving. They have created interesting characters, who you just want to listen to and find out more about. The most interesting scenes in the movie don't necessary involve the slapstick humor, but are the parts, where the characters just sit and talk about themselves. In one of the most memorable scenes of the film, Miles is describing Pinot Noir grapes (his favorite) but eventually you realize he's actually talking about himself. Maya's response to his description is just as good. The scene is almost poetic.<br /><br />The cast in this film is just first rate. Paul Giamatti as the morose, Miles, dosn't just play his part, but inhabits it! The fact that Giamatti wasn't even nominated for an Academy award is mind-boggling. Virginia Madsen (who was nominated) plays the Maya character with a special vitality and sexiness, that the role requires. She makes it believable, that this bright, sexy woman could fall for this sad-sack of a man. Thomas Haden Church (also nomimnated) and Sandra Oh are very funny in their indespensible roles. After seeing these actors you can't imagine anyone else playing these characters.<br /><br />I also want to mention how much this film does work as a road picture. Most movies of this nature ar either filled with endless highways or national monuments. But in this picture, not only are the characters interesting, but so are their vacation stops. Both the locations and the beautiful cinematography (By Phedon Papamichael) just hold your interest and make wish you were there! (In real life the film locations became tourist hotspots!) Finally, I want to mention the breezy, light jazz sountrack from composer, Rolfe Kent, that unobtrusively adds to the flavor of the film. You will unknowingly be humming along with it. This is a wonderfully, funny and moving film, that has some interesting characters. Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

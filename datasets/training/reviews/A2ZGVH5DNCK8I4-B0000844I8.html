<meta name="summary" content="A good film but why do they do this to us?"></head><body><p>Well if this sounds familiar about an ultimate edition that's because it is all to familiar , tip for those who buy DVD's out<br />there if it's not offerd in Dts then there usually will be a huge<br />much more elaborite version as is in the case with Stargate sure<br />im curious as to what this film will sound like in full Dts sound<br />I, mean yeah it's going to be awsome.And is it worth the extra 10<br />dollars yes because nothing can beat Dts as far as home theatre<br />sound but why did they not put this version out , Star Trek has<br />done the same exact thing putting a 2 disk version of there first<br />four films and Lord Of The Rings is going to do it with all three<br />films but are doing it with grace and respectibility thinking of<br />the film and not just a bunch of extra features.<p>  Stargate is a good movie it is exciting and fun to watch the<br />journey into the Stargate and James Spader and Kurt Russell are<br />great as a pairing and the special effects still to this day are<br />mind blowing but movie companys need to learn that what you put<br />in your special or ultimate edition is just as important as the<br />film itself which the only bonus that I, see on this edition is<br />Dts the other options do not look any diffrent from other special<br />editions of this type , so what happens when Warner Brothers is<br />going to bring out The Matrix Reloaded will we have to purchase<br />The Matrix as a 2 disk format this seems to be now only another<br />marketing in the similarity that directors have of selling there<br />film and it does get frustrating if only you could get reimbursed<br />when you bought the new edition of the film, so in actuality with<br />this Stargate version instead of getting a cheesburger as you did<br />before now there giving you a double cheesburger and there hoping<br />you bite into it.</p></body></html>

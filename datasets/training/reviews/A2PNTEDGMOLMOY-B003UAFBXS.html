A charmingly low-budget effort, it has a razor-thin plot that cannot help but generate laughs -- Elvis (Bruce Campbell) is alive and listlessly waits for death to whisk him away from his bed in a convalescent home in Mud Creek, Texas.  His will to live is restored when Bubba Ho-Tep, an Egyptian mummy in cowboy boots, is discovered dining on the nursing home residents' souls by John F. Kennedy (Ossie Davis), who was "dyed black" and deposited in the home to get him out of the way.  Together, Elvis and JFK will fight off this evil spirit before he can turn the nursing home into his own private soul buffet.  Summarize the plot out loud and try to keep from smiling -- I double-dog dare you.<br /><br />Moving at a glacial pace, "Bubba Ho-Tep" does not even have enough going on to meet 90 minutes of screen time.  This is, oddly, a plus.  Just as some books are more appropriately novellas rather than novels, there is a place for an 85-minute movie -- just so long as they are a good 85 minutes.  (One can find many two-plus-hour movies that would have been much better at 85 minutes!)<br /><br />The joys of this movie start with the script.  This is one funny film!  Told with an obvious affection for The King, a plausible yarn is spun about how Elvis actually switched places with his #1 impersonator prior to his demise, living for years as Elvis impersonating an Elvis impersonator impersonating Elvis.  JFK also works as a character, although Ossie Davis isn't given quite as much to work with in the script, and he inexplicably does not have a Boston Brahmin accent.  Always funny and balancing irreverence with affection, this is a script that will surely place some catch-phrases in the American lexicon.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell inhabits Elvis' decrepit body as if born to the role, down to the feebly serious karate moves and other traditional Elvis cliches.  Ossie Davis, always a pleasure to watch on screen, again personifies dignity, even when surrounded by profound silliness.  How these two actors retained such straight faces throughout the film is a wonder.<br /><br />Every once in a while a movie comes along that defies a ratings system -- even the five-star rating system has limits.  You try to preserve the five-star ratings for awesome, terrific, inspiring movies -- it cheapens "Casablanca" if you give a five-star rating to every movie that is merely "really good."  And while "Bubba Ho-Tep" does not rise to the level of a five-star film, one must ask how it could have been much better than it is.  Two excellent performances, a wickedly-funny script, and purposefully-campy special effects make "Bubba Ho-Tep" a true comic gem that may not find itself on the American Film Insitute Top 100 (of anything), but it is one heck of a funny little film, and well worth your attention.  Destined to be a cult classic.</p></body></html>

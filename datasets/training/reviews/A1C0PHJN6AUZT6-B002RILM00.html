<meta name="summary" content="Wow, but I'm scared to write about how much I liked this movie!"></head><body><p>I realize that most of the reviewers on amazon hated this movie, and they all have valid reasons for their opinions. However, at the risk of people thinking I have no taste what so ever, I have to admit that I love this movie! I love the scenery, costumes, the sets, acting, storyline, almost everything about it, I really like. I've watched it a bunch of times, and I love it more every time! I will say that I really adore B horror movies that border on camp, and that's how I took this movie. It's a faveorite of mine, which goes to show that sometimes there's no rhyme or reason to people's reactions. You'll hate this movie or love it, there will be no in between. If you hate this movie, like most people seem to, please don't vote against me just because I have a difference of opinion. If you haven't seen it, rent before you buy it.</p></body></html>

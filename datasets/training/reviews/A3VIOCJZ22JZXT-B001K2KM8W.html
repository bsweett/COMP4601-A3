<meta name="summary" content="Myth and reality mix in a world of threat and renewal"></head><body><p>This is one of the most imaginative and unique films I have seen in years. It is a dark fairy tale for adults and is not a children's movie. The film is a mixture of fairy tale and dark realism since it combines images from the Mediterranean's pre-Christian mythologies with the horror of Fascism in Franco's Spain. The overlap between these two concepts, classical mythology and fascism, is violence and threat as well as unreasonable power over the powerless. Myths often involve heroic action, often taken by an innocent person or child, that helps overcome the forces of evil. The film is very skillful in combining these concepts where they are verbalized by the mythical creatures but we see a parallel world in reality as the rustic peasants develop resistance to the forces of fascism.<br />The transitional character between the fantasy world of mythology and the harsh world of fascist reality is a little girl, the daughter of the new wife of a Fascist officer. She travels between these world through an ancient labyrinth hidden in the woods outside the fascist compound. Here she meets mischievous fairies but also a somewhat threatening and mysterious faun who is ambiguous as to his full intentions. The faun is identified as Pan, the child of the god Hermes, who was the god of transitions and doorways. She is told she is the Princess Moana and must undertake 3 tasks to gain her rightful throne. As in many myths, this child is given three tasks to claim their rightful position with the gods. This puts our young heroine into danger not only when she is in the labyrinth performing tasks but also when she is with her mother and step-father among the fascist and hidden resistance fighters. The adventures within the mythological world with a giant toad full of slime to an amazing monster who is awakened when someone eats from his table and who sees through eyeballs in the palms of his hands.<br />To achieve the tasks prescribed by the gods and to overcome the evils of fascism, resilience and creativity are required and so once again we see overlap between the two worlds. Monstrosity can be reflected in the world of imaginary monsters but also in the acts of the fascists as they torture and kill innocent villagers as well as resistance fighters.  The young female protagonist is not fully protected from the evil of her step-father by her weak mother, suffering with a difficult pregnancy and childbirth. She does not feel fully protected and she is indeed vulnerable to the dark gaze of her dark murderous step-father. She is most protected by the housekeeper who plays many roles in this complex film. Children may retreat into fantasy when threatened but this poor little girl finds a fantasy world that demand much of her and a real world full of real dark threats. This film has some of the best integration of fantasy and reality since A.S. Byatt's the Dijin in the Nightingale's Eye or the works of Borges.<br /> This film has a different feel to it from a Hollywood production, since it has some ragged ends and images that are more European than North American. This is part of the film's strength. The Pan creature for example would have probably been more of a Santa Claus with goat legs if the film had been made in Hollywood. Instead, he is mysterious and ambiguous in a world with little clarity.<br /><br />The child actress Ivana Baquero plays the child Ofelia. She does a super job. Sergi Lopez plays her evil, cruel, fascist step-father Captain Vidal. He is an excellent actor and he has the ability to radiate threat on the screen. All scripts, sets, costumes, special effects, and cinematography were excellent. It all comes together into a great film.</p></body></html>

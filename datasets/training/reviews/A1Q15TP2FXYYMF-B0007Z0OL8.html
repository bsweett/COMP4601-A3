Brought to us by the Matt Stone & Trey Parker who brought us South Park this is just another example of why these guys are so admired in the world of comedy. Team America a thunderbirds like crew of police who are determined to destroy terrorism from the Muslims.<br /><br />To most people this would be considered to be a racist attack on Muslims but that's not the case, it is merely a poke of fun at the way people look at Muslims since the start of the war and that is shown by how they speak in the movie because after all they are from "turka turkastan."<br /><br />The Team itself are puppets worthy of Thunderbirds and it is very comical how they walk and did i mention the puppet sex scene? yes you heard me right a puppet sex scene which will have you roaring with laughter(That was when the wee came out).<br /><br />Like in South Park even the celebrities aren't safe in this political movie as they are part of a crew determined to gain control of the world.<br /><br />If you are a fan of silly type comedy then you will certainly love this film because it is hysterical.</p></body></html>

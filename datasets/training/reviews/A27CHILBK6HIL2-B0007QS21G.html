The sad part is that they marketed this movie so much that by the time you do see it you will have seen almost every major scene be it in trailers, clips, or even the 10 minute preview that aired on FOX. What the movie has is the idea of mankind and survival. The title of the movie may seem awkward but the title is symbolically talking about the future. It's kind of saying "what now?". What will the future bring in times to come and how will mankind respond to it? The title is also saying that change is always imminent and at the doorstep and our lives can change at any given moment be it from our decisions or some other force. There was a part in the movie when the girl tells her friend that all the time she spent learning and achieving for her future has gone to waste. There is some thought provoking questions raised by the movie but its then covered up in special effects and cliched scenes of destruction. I lowered my head in shame when a tornado just so happened to form for enough time to touch down, destroy the Hollywood sign, and then disperse. We've also seen a giant tidal wave hit New York city before in Deep Impact, we've seen massive tornadoes in Twister, and we've seen humans surviving incredible icy conditions in Alive. The movie is entertaining though, the special effects are very good, the questions provoked are somewhat interesting, but they are not enough to save this "popcorn flick". This is a perfect example of a movie creating a passable story just so that it can create its special effects. A movie that has a good story and can aid it with special effects is different. The whole father-son idea was not very good anyway.<br /><br />ACTING: The acting is mediocre in the movie. The younger actors in the movie do a so-so job while the veteran actors do a tad bit better. Dennis Quaid is a very one dimensional actor and his acting her is similar to his acting in The Alamo. The characters of this movie really added nothing except for some forced emotion during the poignant scenes.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: A fun summer movie but it has nothing new to offer the audience. I really cant think of anything that would make the premise of this movie any better because I personally think it shouldn't have been made in the first place. I also don't think that something like that could happen, and if it could it wouldn't happen so quickly and sneak up on us like that. Global patterns in weather that big don't develop that quickly. With all the weather stations worldwide and people in those professions I would think we would see something like that start to develop over time and not be surprised with only a day or two to react.

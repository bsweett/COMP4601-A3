Thank You For Smoking does have some big laughs, but it just doesn't hang together as a movie.  The titles are extremely good - and it does contain one high concept joke - no one is actually ever seen smoking a cigarette throughout the entire picture.  But film is a "show me don't tell me" medium, and Nick's tiresome monologues, required to set up point of view and plot turns, show the fingerprints of a director with young and heavy hands.<br /><br />What this film does get right is the pitch; cynicism is rampant and shows up consistently, there are no heroes.  Robe Lowe is perfectly cast as the completely soul-less super-agent, and the brief moments his assistant spends on screen are memorable.  The reliable Sam Elliott is note perfect - his moral outrage quivers visibly with the proximity of cash.  Robert Duvall, who by now could mail in a performance like this, is very comfortable as the "Captain" - tobacco industry ruler - and even seems to exhibit some remorse at the idea of killing his grand-daughter.  J.K. Simmons - a consistently excellent actor - is outstanding as BR, our protagonist's ruthless boss who pretty much epitomizes opportunism.  Katie Holmes as Heather Holloway is enchanting as she steals our hope that the fourth estate might be on a morally higher plane than everyone else in the miasma.<br /><br />The kidnapping episode, the book's lynch pin, is used, but abused, it seems to drop out of the air then conveniently disappear.  But that's not the film's overriding problem.  Aaron Eckhart as Nick is winning, but completely uninteresting.  Any engaging substance this film might have generated would have come from Nick's personality, and inner struggle with the facile way he bends truth.  Since we never see anything remotely resembling a personality, we can't like him or dislike him, we just look at him as a hideous reflection of what we've become, a symbol of the manipulative and disingenuous forces surrounding us.  For Nick, and for everyone here, truth isn't even an issue anymore; the issue is, what is sell-able?  It's an accurate social observation that would have made a good essay, did make a good book, and didn't make a good movie.</p></body></html>

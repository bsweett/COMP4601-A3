<meta name="summary" content="raunchy, very funny John Cusack comedy.."></head><body><p>this is a comedy, and be prepared for very adult language (if you watch the unrated version).<br /><br />This is a story of 4 forty-something best friends who have drifted apart in recent years, due to marriage, family, and career.  One friend suggests they they all four go back to a resort that they enjoyed together as seniors in high school.  They all agree.<br /><br />Once there, they all get in a hot tub.  Without giving away too much of the plot.....the hot tub transports them back 20 years to the time when they first visited the resort.<br /><br />they have to find a way back to present day and at the same time not disturb the space-time continuum with their actions.<br /><br />For those that came of age during the 80's (like myself), you will enjoy the nostalgia of that time, while the movie plays many clips of songs from that era.<br /><br />John Cusack is great (many will remember his movies from the 80's were teen comedy coming of age films) so this film triggers some of his own movies from that time.<br /><br />a funny trip down memory lane for Gen Xer's</p></body></html>

However, the movie does a good job of offering reasons a wolf pack 'might' behave with such aggression. Forget all that, this isn't really too much about the wolves behavior, other than on the surface. I felt the thrill of a Jack London adventure tale (which I adore). Not only is it Man vs. Nature, but it is Man vs. Man and Man vs. Himself all rolled into one and in the most extreme. The biggest obstacle the main character truly has to overcome is his past and the ability to choose life over death in the first place. If you were left out in nature what would keep you going forward? Why do some people become leaders and others just give up? What in your past has shaped who you are in your future? There were so many layers of questions about human nature and a deeper thread wound through this story that I can hardly see it as just a life and death adventure tale. One particular scene really spooked me (and I had to watch a couple times). When they are pursued by the wolves and standing by the fire look closely at the tree line...very eerie effect. It has a very symbolic 'shadow of death' quality I couldn't help but admire. I recall a time up in Leadville, Colorado when I heard wolves in the far distance. It was both beautiful and haunting at the same time. I swore I saw this in the tree line as I looked at the snow on the ground that night under the moonlight. I quickly retreated to my car and slept there rather than my tent! I got the same chill up my spine while I watched this movie. Very well done. Just keep in mind that as with Jaws and other movies like it that this is 'over the top' Hollywood drama, not necessarily true animal behavior.</p></body></html>

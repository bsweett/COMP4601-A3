<meta name="summary" content="Salty spy"></head><body><p>In this spy thriller, Angelina Jolie is a star.  She is transforming her looks from blonde to black, long hair to short hair, female to male gender.  Her attire goes from business sexy to matrix-like sexy.  As in "Lara Croft" movie this heroine is smart, determined, beautiful and she can fight, pull some serious stunts by riding on the top of the truck, or riding a motorcycle bike. Oh, and this time around, the heroine speaks Russian!<br /><br />This is an action packed movie that will keep you on your toes from start to finish.  However, I found some of the scenes difficult to watch, especially the ones where Jolie's heroine gets punched around by beefy male advesaries.  Good entertainment movie that leaves ending open to "Salt 2" sequel....</p></body></html>

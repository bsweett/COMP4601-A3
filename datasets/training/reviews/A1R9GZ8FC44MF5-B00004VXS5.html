<meta name="summary" content="Leone stands for Old Tarantino."></head><body><p>This film feels like Tarantino, its not however, its Leone who you can tell inspired Tarantino.  Hell Tarantino even used one of the songs from this movie in Kill Bill Vol 2.  This movie has a little bit of action, a little bit of drama, a little bit of comedy, and a whole lot of style.  The only real flaw is the sound editing when people talk, sometimes it feels like one of those sucky Bruce Lee "films" where you hear different things then how their mouths are movin, this happens sometimes, not the whole time, but enough to make it kind of irritating, its a small flaw but after 3 hours it gets to ya.  There is one other thing that really isnt a flaw but is somewhat annoying, the pace, sometimes it takes the characters 3 minutes to walk acroos the room, or 5 minutes to start talking, i know its suppose to build tension or suspense, but once you get 2 minutes of a guy standing there not doing anything i think we get the point, another small thing.  Apart from that the movies is brilliant, the music is freakin awesome definetly inspired Tarantino, the characters names ( good, bad, ugly) more style and original, there is some cool western action and a civil war scene where they blow up a bridge (thats very cool), and theres lots of funny things that just supply more entertainment.  I give the movie a 9 out of a 10, those 2 things make the overall feel suffer alittle, but trust me its the best western ever made, one that you can watch without and enjoy not just watch and hope to die.  Its definetly the only western i like, in fact i think its Leones best, i also like the fact that he didnt put tons of smut in this one like he did with Once upon a time in America, a good movie but way too much smut, see this movie its a classic, its like watchin Tarantino do a western a couple of years ago thats all, totally kick ass.</p></body></html>

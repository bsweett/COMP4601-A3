<meta name="summary" content="Another hope... and another"></head><body><p>Fans have been clamoring for the original, theatrical "Star Wars" movies from the 70s and 80s for years now. But by the time director George Lucas put them out on DVD, he had redone the trilogy with new special effects and inserted scenes.<br /><br />Buuuuut... that's not what the fans have wanted. They wanted the unadulterated original. And until the end of December, a special two-disc edition of the classic, groundbreaking "Star Wars IV - A New Hope" will be available, with both the theatrical and the new versions. Fortunately, it doesn't seem to cost any more than a one-disc DVD.<br /><br />Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is bored and frustrated on his uncle's moisture farm. That all changes when his uncle buys two new droids, C3P0 and R2D2 (Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker), the second of which leads Luke to the eccentric old Ben Kenobi (Sir Alec Guiness) -- and a transmission of a beautiful princess (Carrie Fisher) asking for Kenobi's help.<br /><br />At first, Luke doesn't plan to go, since he still has to help his uncle with the harvest. But when he returns home to find his uncle and aunt murdered by Imperial stormtroopers, he agrees to come with Kenobi and help rescue the princess -- and train to become a Jedi knight, "like my father." But to rescue the princess, he and his new friends will venture into the heart of the planet-destroying Death Star, and have to deal with the evil Darth Vader...<br /><br />Lucas's movie was a groundbreaking moment in cinematic history -- nobody had ever done special effects or science fiction like this before, and it made the mold for future stories with battleships, evil overlords and distant planet. What was better, it was spiced up with influences from Akira Kurosawa to J.R.R. Tolkien, and sprinkled with some Eastern philosophy for "the Force."<br /><br />This was also the biggest role for the three stars Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford, as the naive young farmboy-turned-hero, the feisty princess, and the jaded outlaw. They all did very solid jobs, even with the most awkward bits of dialogue, as they run around the slick, claustrophobic Death Star and the slightly run-down Millennium Falcon.<br /><br />What's the difference between the two versions? Plenty, actually. Many of the scenes just have a CGI character or two wandering around, or a ship swooping down over a control tower. But some scenes were never in the original at all (stormtroopers scouting in the desert), and others were cut, redone and put back in again (like Han's nasty encounter with Jabba in the hangar).<br /><br />Some of these changes are good, some are bad. The best ones are the insertion of tiny moving pilots into the X-wings. But it's worth sacrificing that to have the original bar scene back, as it was in 1977: The original featured Han talking to a bounty hunter, and then shooting him under the table; the remastered one has a very fake-looking shot of the hunter shooting first... and missing.<br /><br />Is it actually bad? Not really; the dramatic punch of scenes like the approach of the Millennium Falcon or the victory over the Death Star are still unmarred. But it feels like it's been slicked down until it loses the raw, groundbreaking appeal that the original had. It's a credit to the theatrical version that this many years later, people still want to see it in its original glory, dated special-effects or not.<br /><br />Fans of both versions of "A New Hope" will find them in this two-disc edition, and those who just want the theatrical can switch it to a single box. Either way, it's certainly worth the money.</p></body></html>

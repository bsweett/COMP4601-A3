But it is my favorite movie of all time.  I can't say it was catching lightening in a bottle, as several of the actors were famous before, and several more continue to be popular today.  Although it is one of those rare achievements where the cinema version outshines it's literary equivalent.  <p>Movies have the power to create worlds entirely different to us, and in a sense, "The Godfather" is one of those movies.  Yes, there is organized crime, and yes, they still seem to have "families" to distinguish one group from another.  But this movie still created a different world by having no character that was not part of this world in the cast.  They are either involved in something illegal, or related to someone who is.  <p>With this isolation, it makes us look at the film differently than if there were so-called "honest" people as part of the movie.  If that were the case, it would be easier to be reminded that these people are criminals.  And not just petty ones.  We see murderers, big time drug dealers, and those that spend large dollars corrupting the so-called "legitimate" government.  <p>Since everyone is more or less playing by these rules, it then makes it easier to root for what would be the bad guys otherwise.  Vito Corleone has murdered, and ordered the murders of others.  But since we have not been told of the innocent people that were probably killed as part of his ascension, and the fact that he was not eager to get into big-time drug operations, and he was just, well, a grandfatherly old man, he's the "good guy" over that dastardly Barzini.  <p>So we care that he truly loves his daughter and wants to give her a good wedding.  We think he's a good guy because he didn't want "all of this" for Michael.  And we agree that when he says "a man who does not spend time with his family is not a real man", that this is wisdom from what must be a very wise man.  Showing that this type of family can indeed love and care for each other while still taking care of business is what makes the film great in my eyes.</p></body></html>

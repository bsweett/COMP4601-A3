Peter O reigns supreme in this defining role that transforms his ego as well as his successful efforts to unite radically misaligned desert tribes, a feat comparable to Patton!  I treasured the lingering moments that demonstrated the tribal life and cross cultural assimilation... the pace was perfect for demonstraing the patient alignment of diverse goals with successful results... The overwhelming addiction of power and watching Lawrence dance in his new robes of freedom yielded a commensurate level of joy without the consicous responsibility of a wretched nation fighting for independence, albeit with limited success... How these war scenes were filmed is beyond my comprehension, have ultimate respect for the crew, actors and energy required to produce this phenomenal presentation.... what really happened with Effendi though, changed his whole mindset and the only plot hole I wish was resolved... v. v. high recommend!</p></body></html>

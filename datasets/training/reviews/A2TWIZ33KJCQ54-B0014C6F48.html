<meta name="summary" content="A FUN FILM THAT TRIES TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY"></head><body><p>CAN JENNA HAVE HER CAKE AND EAT IT TOO?<br /><br />BACK TO 'OZ' SENTIMENTS? --- Jenna learns that there is truly NO PLACE LIKE HOME, but is it too late? Can Jenna have her cake and eat it too and if she does, what will happen to her?<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: COOL AGE APPROPRIATE FILM THAT DEALS WITH REAL ISSUES<br /><br />Well done age appropriate comedy that underscores the universal frustration and impatience that teenage girls are known for. However, this movie's theme is about doing something about it, and to that end the film takes Jenna on a magical mystery time voyage which lands her right where she thinks she wants to be ---- 30 - COOOOOOL & HOT!<br /><br />But is that exactly what she wanted?<br /><br />FORTUNATELY MORE SUBSTANCE FOLLOWS ---- '13 GOING ON 30' ABOUT SELF-AWARENESS<br /><br />There is a price to pay for this jump to age thirty, and as the movie progresses, Jenna becomes more aware of that and more importantly; MORE 'SELF-AWARE' IN THIS LEARNING PROCESS! Exactly what Jenna discovers in this process is what the film is all about.<br /><br />Needless to say, this is a well done fantasy that literally every girl has probably contemplated at one time or another in one way or another. This film brings that universal theme all together so that it does seem to resonate in similar but personal ways for different viewers.<br /><br /> -*- THE PLAYERS -*-<br /><br />Jennifer Garner - Jenna Rink<br /><br />Mark Ruffalo - Matt Flamhaff<br /><br />Judy Greer - Lucy Wyman<br /><br />Andy Serkis - Richard Kneeland<br /><br />Kathy Baker - Beverly Rink<br /><br />Phil Reeves - Wayne Rink<br /><br />Samuel Ball - Alex Carlson<br /><br />Marcia de Bonis - Arlene<br /><br />Christa B. Allen - Young Jenna Rink<br /><br />Sean Marquette - Young Matt Flamhaff<br /><br />Kiersten Warren - Trish Sackett<br /><br />Gina Mantegna - Gina<br /><br /> -*- THE MAJOR PRODUCTION CREDITS -*-<br /><br />Gary Winick - Director [ also Directed the NEW -"Charlotte's Web" - 2006]<br /><br />Josh Goldsmith - Screenwriter [also wrote - "What Women Want"]<br /><br />Cathy Yuspa - Screenwriter [also wrote - "What Women Want"]<br /><br />THE DVD -- GOOD VIDEO/AUDIO QUALITY AND WIDESCREEN TOO!<br /><br />You'll find several featurettes about 'the making of the film', but they were brief, too brief if you liked the film, as I did, than I would have liked since this, after all, is a fantasy film.<br /><br />IN THE END -- WORTH SEEING - STRIKES A CORD STRONGLY AMONG TEEN GIRLS<br /><br />Much in the same tone as "The Wizard of Oz","13 GOING ON 30" takes the thoughts and ideas of a disgruntled young girl, and plays them out in full fantasy form, with somewhat the same outcome. "13 GOING ON 30" is definitely one of the better teen flicks out there, and it nicely melds fantasy with a girls viewpoint into a somewhat familiar though original story.<br /><br />GOOD TASTE WITHOUT PATRONIZING OR CONDESCENDING TO TEENS OR PARENTS<br /><br />For parents, this is both an enlightening film, and a kind of time-capsule that is executed with surprisingly good tastes. An ideal film for parents to see with teens without the cringing discomfort that some films yield when viewed with the whole family.</p></body></html>

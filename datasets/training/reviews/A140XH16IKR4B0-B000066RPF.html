<meta name="summary" content="Some call it....the greatest comedy ever"></head><body><p>What can you say about a film whose script has been virtually memorized by legions of fans since its release in 1975?<br /><br />"Fetchez la vache!" "Bring out your dead!" "English knnnnn-iggets!" "How do you noo she is a witch?" "Castle Anthrax" "Of course it's a good idea!" "Some call me.....Tim?" "It's only a flesh wound!" "Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?" "The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch" "Answer me these questions three!"<br /><br />Each of these quotes will immediately be recognized by Grail fans. The list of memorable lines and sight gags goes on and on.<br /><br />The film itself is the greatest of all comedies by the greatest of all comedy troupes. No small intellect is behind the script, and no insignificant amount of historical knowledge either. The actors avoid playing their parts with self-knowing irony, which gives viewers the a chance to get (or miss) the humor on their own. As much fun as the film are the director's commentaries and various shorts depicting the search for castles (not as easy as it might be supposed) and the shooting of the film itself. Two sad truths: Graham Chapman is no longer with us and John Cleese has developed into (perhaps always was?) an insufferable bore. Ah well, I'm over it.<br /><br />"Holy Grail" is a daffy, delicious send-up of socialist politics, encounters with the divine, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, the Grail romances, medieval science and the perils of living in a verminous and crud-bestrewn land. For anyone with an intellectual sense of humor, this is a DVD you are guaranteed to watch over and over again.</p></body></html>

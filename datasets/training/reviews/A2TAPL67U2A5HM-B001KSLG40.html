<meta name="summary" content="Night of the Living Dead (Enhanced Edition) - 1968"></head><body><p>Night of the Living Dead (Enhanced Edition) - 1968 is a horror movie classic with a well-written script, effective music and well played parts. The beautiful Judith O' Dea plays one of the leading roles and the leading male role was played by Duane Jones. At the time it was seen as very progressive for the hero to be played by an African American. This is one of the best horror movies that I have ever seen and can be compared with other greats such as The Omen, The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby. I can strongly recommend it. 5/5.</p></body></html>

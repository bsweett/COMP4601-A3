<meta name="summary" content="Surviving isolation"></head><body><p>Having seen a great Federal Express commercial during the Superbowl which was a take off on this movie, I decided I would finally see it. Tom Hanks plays a Fed Ex supervisor who is on a plane when it goes down. This movie is well known as a tale of survival when Hanks washes up on an uninhabited tropical island. But unlike Gilligan's Island, it is not comedic. Rather, it takes a great will to survive as well as an ability to hang on to the edge of sanity to keep going and ultimately be rescued.<p>I'm sure I'm giving nothing away by revealing that he is ultimately rescued and there begins the second part of the dvd; life after being marooned for four years. To me, this was the most interesting part of the movie. In the movie, symbolically, as well as literally, he finds himself at a crossroad as he contemplates getting on with his life after so many changes have occured. Just imagine, you are isolated for four years and then you have to pick up and go on in a world that did not stop and wait for you. That's quite an intriguing situation.I reccommend this dvd.</p></body></html>

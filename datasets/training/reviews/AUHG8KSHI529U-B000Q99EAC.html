<meta name="summary" content="A very well done and moving ending to the series - more like the first Rocky than any of the others"></head><body><p>The first Rocky film had a heart and a soul that mattered to people a lot more than the fight.  Rocky was a kind man who wanted to get through life, was unhappy about being a collector for a local loan shark, and fell in love with Adrian.  The whole Apollo Creed thing fell into his lap and changed his life forever.<br /><br />The spirit that made the first film a joy faded with each new film while the fighting sequences became the point of the film.  Sort of like they way the gadgets overshadowed Bond in many of the subsequent films after "Goldfinger".  This film is so enjoyable because it has the heart and soul of the first film and the inevitable fight (this time ostensibly an exhibition) is the right send off for the hero.<br /><br />The film opens later in Rocky's life.  He has experienced the one loss he could not bear well.  Yet, he has found the grace to bear up under its tremendous weight.  Paulie is still as miserable as ever, actually even angrier and in not very healthy way.  He lives in a row house just as he did in the first film and has a small restaurant that serves decent food but whose main attraction is for folks to come by and get a picture taken with Rocky and hear the champ tell his old stories for the ten thousandth time and Stallone does just the right touch on making the stories sound that way.<br /><br />We also see him fill some of the emotional gaps in his life in a very touching way.  Since Adrian is ever present in his heart, it is very touching to see him develop a friendship with a woman that is really a friendship and not a prelude to something that could encroach on where Rocky really is emotionally.<br /><br />The most wrenching relationship in the movie is between Rocky and his son.  Yes, sons do have to become their own man and it is incredibly tough to find an independent place to stand when your father was the heavyweight champion of the world and people want to know you to meet your father.  This is a very active force in Rocky's life and leads him in several directions that all make real sense.<br /><br />I also appreciated the way the film actually set up the fight between Rocky and Mason "the Line" Dixon (by the very capable Antonio Tarver) by actually creating sympathy for him by making him unsympathetic.  Yes, a neat trick.  The film doesn't set him as a big villain as previous Rocky films did with Clubber Lang or Ivan Drago.<br /><br />This was a very fine way to end the series and does so on a rather moving high note.</p></body></html>

I have a THX 7.1 system and even though i thought the film was lacking in all aspects, the sound is out of this world.  I'm not a fan of this kind of film, it was fun to watch but not really worth the money to buy. The extras are kind of a waste of time but the 6.1 is well worth it.</p></body></html>

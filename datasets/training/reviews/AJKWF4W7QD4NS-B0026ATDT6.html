Taking place in South Korea, The Host revolves around a lazy narcoleptic (Song Kang-ho) who, along with his father, alcoholic brother, and archer sister, unite to save his young daughter who was kidnapped by the giant, reptilian/amphibian mutant beast after it's initial rampage; which is also undoubtedly one of the most unforgettable moments to ever grace a movie of this type.  In between all of the slight cracks towards governments and frantic monster mayhem, The Host is a smart and frequently entertaining blast that surprisingly manages to deliver like no monster movie has before in years.  The CGI effects are mostly great, and the slight moments of humor offer a nice change of pace as well.  The only real flaw of The Host is that the film is too long for its own good.  It would have worked better had it only been an hour and a half as opposed to two full hours.  That aside, The Host is a real treat for monster movie fans looking for something surprisingly good, and by all means is more than worth seeing.</p></body></html>

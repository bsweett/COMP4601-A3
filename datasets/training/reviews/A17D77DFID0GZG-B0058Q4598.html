<meta name="summary" content="Is this DVD version as bad as people say?  Not for me it wasn't."></head><body><p>Boy, has this film been pummeled.  Generally speaking, most people and most professional reviewers really disliked this remake.  Heck, I usually dislike remakes of popular films as well, so this movie already had one foot in the grave.  There are numerous reasons why people hated it and I'll give just a few examples here:<br /><br />1.  Does not follow the original movie to a tee (cold war and potential violent escalation into space in the original vs. mainly ecological reasons -- a very unpopular topic these days -- in the remake).<br />2.  The little boy was a nice kid in the original vs an unlikeable brat in the remake (but since the boy lost his father and is being raised by a woman he feels is an outsider, I understood this behavior).<br />3.  Klaatu (Michael Rennie) ended up addressing a small crowd of scientists and gave them a warning in the original, while the remake did not do this.  Both movies did stop all electrical and mechanical devices throughout the world (thus the film's title).  The original showed this early in the film, while the remake did this toward the end of the film (giving the remake some added punch as well as an additional plot hole).<br />4.  Michael Rennie's Klaatu seemed to be more accessible, more understanding and more human and humane, especially toward the boy (he smiled a lot), while Keanu Reeves' Klaatu was cold as ice (but one can also see a slow hint of confusion and conflict in his mind, as the film moves forward).<br /><br />To be honest, I wasn't a great fan of the original (although I certainly liked it at the time).  The problem is, it has been at least 35 years ago that I last seen it, but when I viewed it again (this dvd set provides both movies, which is a nice plus), I suddenly realized how completely dated the original movie now seems.  While justly rewarded at the time of its release (and it grew in stature for many years -- it was pretty sophisticated for that time period), the original now seems ignorant ... or far too innocent ... and just not believable by today's standards.  Face it folks, we've changed (or matured) drastically since the 50's, and so have our children.<br /><br />In the remake we don't find the alien Klaatu enjoying human interactions at all, including the boy.  What we find is an uncaring alien that doesn't want to be here, but was sent to give the ultimate warning ... change immediately to save the Earth from ecological disaster ... or die.  When unable to address the world leaders, and finding no compelling reason not to go ahead with his mission, he sets loose the havoc that will destroy all life.<br /><br />Personally, I found this concept to be much more believable (although perhaps a bit trigger-happy).  I also liked the concept of the Ark ships (saving as many species as possible, other than those nasty humans).  Add to that some excellent special effects and I found the movie quite captivating.  Oh, it has its own set of plot holes (it's tied to the original script, after all), but by and large I thought it was a much needed and solid remake.  Could it have been better?  Absolutely (there is some pretty stilted dialogue in certain scenes).  Between 1 and 10, I give this movie a 7 (or a marginal 4-star rating ... actually, 3.5 stars), and I'm glad I have added it to my dvd collection (Too bad I bought this before I got my blu-ray player).</p></body></html>

If you liked "Independence Day", then you will love this newest film from Emmerich and company. No longer are there aliens ready to destroy civilization, but humanity's greatest enemy isn't terrorism, it's Mother Nature herself. Let me tell you now, Mother Nature must never be messed with and this movie is an excellent example of this. <p> It's another hot and oppressively muggy day in New York and things are running normally elsewhere around most of the rest of the world but things start turning strange and freaky when the weather all over the globe starts turning chaotic and destructive when a blizzard buries New Delhi, India, and basketball sized hail pounds Tokyo, Japan, along with the strongest hurricanes ever recorded occurring simultaneously. A meteorologist scientist who studies the climates of the world has made a startingly discovery of the Ice Sheet in Antarctica breaking up and an iceberg the size of Rhode Island (One the Size of France actually did float into the Ocean from Antarctica a while back) breaks away from the Ice Shelf in Antarctica. Professor Jack Hall is alarmed at the trends taking place in the conditions of the atmosphere and the waters of the Atlantic Ocean have turned colder which results in the Gulf Stream coming to a dead stop and this triggers off a catastrophic chain reaction of the world's climate turning MUCH colder in a matter of days. On top of it all, the alarming fact that has gripped Hall's mind is that the world is on the brink of another Ice Age which threatens the entire northern Hemisphere where the bulk of the world's population lives in. <p> Meanwhile his son Jack Hall is on a flight to New York City for an academic competition but NYC is in the midst of an exceptionally severe thunderstorm but the storm won't let up after three consecutive days and they are unaware that a massive Ice Age that is overtaking the northern hemisphere. Now Sam Hall now has to endure the dangers of the massive glaciers and save his son from the freezing climate. The storm systems are also pulling extremely cold temperatures out of the mesosphere and causing an instant drop of over 100 degrees in a matter of seconds over any region above the center of the storm systems and now Jack and his comrades must find shelter before the Antarctic cold spell overtakes the remains of the city and take shelter. During this time his father Sam Hall must find shelter and rescue Jack from the remains of NYC before it's too late and they all freeze to death in the extreme cold temperatures of less than 80 below zero. <p> This movie absolutely lives up to all of the hype surrounding it. While many believe that it is impossible for such abrupt change in climate to occur in one day, it's not totally far fetched for it to happen and this movie really makes it look a lot more realistic. I was terrified at the numerous scenes throughout much of the movie especially in the first hour of the film because such climate changes will have grave repercussions against EVERYONE on this planet and it's a clear message that WE MUST do our part in helping to cut down on greenhouse emissions and help to clean up our environment because if we stand around and do nothing, things like this might just happen and this movie works very well at getting out the message of this. The special effects are especially amazing and make the entire climate effects look really realistic especially with the tornadoes flattening the large skyscrapers and even destroying airliners on the airport runways. The giant hurricanes also are incredibly scary to look at but really the special effects are absolutely stunning and almost realistic looking. <p> This movie does have it's share of flaws such as focusing almost primarily only on American cities but at least it doesn't say that it's the only country being hit by the Ice Age with scenes like New Delhi being buried in a massive blizzard and Tokyo with basketball-sized hail and to some extent this movie could've been better by focusing on other regions like the Middle East, Australia, and the Southern Hemisphere but since I've had a lifelong fascination with severe weather and weather related disasters, this movie is almost like a dream to me. This is everything that "Twister" and "Vertical Limit" wish they were. This movie trashes both of them right out into the Ice Age with a much better plot, more original twist and a much more powerful tone. The acting by almost the entire cast is good but even then, they've all seen better days but the flaws in this movie are more than compromised with a really excellent and powerful message of the possibilities of what Global Warming may do to civilization. I simply cannot understand why people would shun this movie but unless you're some lazy callous SUV driver or some supporter of some polluting industry, this movie is a must see and it should be a strong wake-up call to what may happen if we don't do what we should to take care of this Earth because it's the only earth we have. <p> They may have labeled this as a move sorely made for sheer entertainment but for me, being a highly environmentally conscious individual, this movie is a really important film that I strongly recommend that EVERYONE go and see. This movie is worth seeing several times over on the big screen and it already shaping up to be one of my favorite movies of 2004.</p></body></html>

While women in film are no strangers to violence, they usually don't do the killing themselves, and especially not with a gun.  Foster plays the role of Erica Bain, a hip radio essayist, with the same courage she conjures in Silence of the Lambs.  Bain and her fianc&eacute;, David (played by Naveen Andrews), are attacked during a nightly walk.  David does not survive his injuries, and Bain's life proceeds down a dark and violent path.<br /><br />The unseen protagonist of the film is psychological closure after a traumatic event.  The plot of the film would not occur if the police had brought to justice the men who attacked Bain and David.  It's the need for closure that drives the plot into highly predictable and sometimes unlikely situations.  The film is not a total loss, however, thanks most to Foster and Terrence Howard.  Howard plays the role of Detective Mercer, and in the hands of a lesser actor, Mercer would have appeared as irrelevant as the character truly is.  Howard's charisma and patience won me over, as did Foster's wide-ranging and dynamic characterization.  The subtle love interest between Foster and Howard was well written and well acted.  R-rated films rarely show people interested in each other without forcing them to sleep together.<br /><br />Despite a familiar plot, the movie is highly entertaining, well acted, and at times thought-provoking.  The film does contain scenes of intense violence.  In the end, The Brave One asks us to consider strange mixes of justice and vengeance, vigilantism and law, love and loss; and while the movie does reach closure, it doesn't quite come to a moment of clarity about these important ideas.</p></body></html>

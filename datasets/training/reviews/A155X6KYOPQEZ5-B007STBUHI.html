The novel was based on the Jersey Shore shark attacks in 1916. Jaws helps to re-image what happened on the beaches. Basically all caos.<br /><br />Are the waters safe? The answer to that question on Amity Island is NO. Martin Brody is convinced of that when Christine Watkins's torn up body washes ashore. To fix the problem he has to do one thing. Kill the Shark. Easier said than done. And, better yet, the beaches have to remain open for the Fourth of July celebration. In other words, Brody has to do something about it, and fast. Can he kill the maneating Great White Shark before it kills the people on the beach?<br /><br />So continues Jaws. The whole idea of a shark rampaging public beaches and eating everybody it sees can get a little boring after a while. But the whole plot and storyline is very well laid out. I haven't read the book Jaws, but I'm guessing it's pretty similar to the movie.<br /><br />The acting is really good in Jaws. Roy Scheider does a great job of portraying Martin Brody. Everyone else does a great job too. Also, the movie is pretty good for being filmed in 1975. But I must say that this movie does have blood and is probably not suitable for kids under 12-13. However, you can be the judge of that as the movie itself is only rated PG. Still just be cautious about that.<br /><br />Now for the effects. I guess for a '75 film, they aren't that bad. But you can easily tell the shark is nowhere close to being realistic. It swims like a robot to me. You can be the judge on the shark. I guess you can give them a break for a '75 movie.<br /><br />So the bottomline for Jaws is that it's a good movie. It's not a sci-fi movie either. So if you hate watching sci-fi movies, you're in luck. If you enjoy this movie, you're in for a lot more Jaws movies. There's actually 3 more Jaws movies. So I recommend Jaws to you!</p></body></html>

It is, claims the "old skool" core of fans that make up the base of support for the industry, a complete sell-out, relying on large-scale production values and special effects rather than legitimate fighting skills of the actors (with the notable exception of veteran martial arts female lead Michelle Yeoh) in order to sell itself; it is an act of sound and fury , signifying nothing.<br /><br />To the vast bulk of the filmgoing public who wouldn't know "Drunken Master" from "The Master Of The Flying Guillotine" from "The Five Masters Of Death" from "The Five Deadly Venoms", that criticism meant...well, nothing at all.  What is obvious from the first scene of this movie is that the director of this movie has fashioned a labor of love that has resulted in one of the most beautifully filmed movies in the history of cinema, regardless of genre.<br /><br />Martial arts film purists seem to revel within the primative nature of the films that temd to define that genre.  Poor acting, shallow scripts, ABYSSMAL overdubs, hack-and-slash editing...these are not the hallmarks of classically revered movies.  Yet they seem to do more to define martial arts cinema than any other characteristic save that of the action itself.  Yet "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" does not want for action.  The combat scenes (particularly those involving Michelle Yeoh; Ang Lee definitely knew his most talented fighter and exploited her abilities to the max) are extraordinary, special-effects laden or not.  The TRIUMPH of this movie is that is sees fit to actually present a story that draws the viewer in, that allows the viewer to form an opinion about the characters in between fight scenes...as opposed to just wishing that we could "fast-forward" to the next combat sequence.<br /><br />What we have is a film more suited to the Classical Age, the Greek Tragedy with better fight choreography.  The levity and sense of comic relief that could be expected with a number of Hong Kong cinema classics (and basically every Jackie Chan film ever made) is lacking here, but it is not missed as it has no place.  Themes such as honor, social expectations, unrequited love (from unexpected sources), revenge (this is a kung fu movie, after all)...portrayed in an unconventional environment in an unusual setting (for Western audiences) make this an intriguing movie that has the bonus of some drop-dead action sequences that most people lacking a background in Hong Kong cinema are going to find quite amazing.<br /><br />The acting is quite impressive.  You will want to watch the Mandarin soundtrack with subtitles for the full appreciation of the effect (particularly taking into effect that the Hong Kong/Canton-based actors do not speak it normally); Chow Yun-Fat is best known for his "gun fu" movies made with John Woo, but the depth of his performance in this movie led to his casting opposite Jodie Foster in a non-musical remake of "The King And I".  Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Zhi-yi (was she REALLY only a teenager when this movie was made???) are amazing and wonderfully strong female roles that aren't typically seen in Hong Kong cinema (clearly a male-dominated genre).  Some people have called this movie the best chick flick since "Thelma and Louise", but anyone who would classify either movie in such strictly gender-limiting terms displays an ignorance which must prove to be quite burdensome and suffocatingly limiting.  This is a terrific movie, transcending both genre and gender.  It is the martial arts movie for people who don't like martial arts movies.  It took home Oscars that neither Bruce Lee nor Jackie Chan will ever see.  It is, simply speaking, what going to the movies is supposed to be all about.  If you haven't seen it yet, you're absolutely cheating yourself.</p></body></html>

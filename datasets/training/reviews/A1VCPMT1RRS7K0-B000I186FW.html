I had heard a bit about it, but I rented it with no real knowledge of what the movie was about or even what genre it fit into. This film is thought-provoking, with excellent acting performances and great action scenes. Hugo Weaving is the absolute standout in this film. As V, he is engaging and interesting. He was perfect for the role and I don't believe that anyone in the business could have outdone him in this role. He delivered in terms of action and dialogue- wonderfully on both counts.<br /><br />Natalie Portman also gives quite a powerful performance. Not to give anything away, the interplay between her and Weaving is excellent.<br /><br />The storyline is unique and is done very well.</p></body></html>

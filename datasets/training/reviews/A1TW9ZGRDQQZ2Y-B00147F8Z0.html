<meta name="summary" content="Just watch Alien, Aliens or the first Predator film"></head><body><p>Edit on 6/9/08:<br /><br />After my harsh review below, I had to bump this movie up one star after seeing it a second time on Blu-ray. It is actually good mindless fun with some pretty neat SFX. Just leave your brain on the seat beside you and have a good time.<br /><br />Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem is only a little better than the first Alien vs. Predator film. The teenager drama straight out of the WB was terrible as were all the actors. The creatures look good, but you could hardly see them (especially in the badly shot fight scenes). The Predators do have some really cool weapons and there is one hot chick, but that isn't enough to call this thing anything but what it is. A complete MESS.</p></body></html>

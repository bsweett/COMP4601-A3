<meta name="summary" content="BRUCE A. EVANS, OPUS 2"></head><body><p>**** 2007. Co-written and directed by Bruce A. Evans. A serial killer, affected with remorse, tries to cope with William -temptation- Hurt. This cynical thriller is a UFO in the Hollywood landscape and deserves your attention. The dialogues between Kevin Costner and William Hurt are extremely well written, Demi Moore is on the verge of a nervous breakdown during the whole movie and if I were Mr. Brooks, I'd immediately despatch my daughter to Australia. Or to a European country. Because I'd rather not want her to like me too much. Recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Classic epic war film"></head><body><p>George C. Scott's finest performance as the larger-than-life General Patton. Apart from Patton's military career, this film tries to uncover who the man really was. The genius of modern warfare? A romantic warrior from another time? Or perhaps a crackpot? Perhaps Patton was all of these and more.<p>Even in the massive scope of WWII this film keeps Patton firmly at the center. Regardless of his historical contributions to the war effort, we see him as the stuff of legend -- the kind of epic hero about whom poets like Homer used to sing.<p>As we follow his breathtaking career from the North Africa campaign to the end of the war, we see how Patton's ongoing collisions with the Nazis rivaled those against his own soldiers and superiors.Here was a man who only found purpose in warfare and who almost failed to appreciate it's painful, human element.<p>In the end, Patton triumphs, only to acknowledge that he is just playing a part in a historical drama.</p></body></html>

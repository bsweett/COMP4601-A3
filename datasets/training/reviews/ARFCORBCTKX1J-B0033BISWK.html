It is so thoroughly professional and /assured/, from beginning to end, that it looks as if it's the work of someone with a lot more experience.<br /><br />It's such a finely crafted and rousing piece of movie-making that I was reluctant to give it only four stars. But I had to, because of serious plot and script problems. Even while you're watching, you're all-too-aware that none of it makes any sense. Why are the aliens unable to leave at the beginning, but suddenly able to do so at the end? Why does Christopher spend 20 years accumulating "fuel" to power the shuttle, then suddenly be able to move the mother ship by remote control and use a tractor beam to enter the ship? Why does the "fuel" cause Wikus to mutate (other than to make him the p[r]awn of MNU and the Nigerians)? Most of all, why were the aliens taken from the ship before anyone determined whether they could have been helped /without/ removing them?<br /><br />I'm often criticized for being overly rational (see my "Up!" review) -- "It's only a movie!". But I expect writers to think things through, rather than using whatever pops into their heads. The writers -- one of whom is the director -- supposedly came up with a dozen possible storylines. Peter Jackson apparently didn't bother to tell them that this one had Queen-Mary-sized holes in it.<br /><br />"District 9" is ultimately a drama (though a shallow and not well-developed one) about beings alien to each other learning a degree of trust and respect. It's a modest success on that level, despite failing to tell us much about the aliens' psychology and motivations. It /could/ have been a better film -- though it would have been even darker and more pessimistic than it is.<br /><br />The Blu-ray's image quality is exceptional. Most (if not all) of "District 9" was shot on Sony and RED equipment. Though the BD looks like film, I suspect it's the composite digital "negative", graded to look like motion-picture film. It is of absolute demo quality.</p></body></html>

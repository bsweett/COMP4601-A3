Scott favorite Denzel Washington plays a veteran train-man who, along with rookie Chris Pine, find an ordinary work day going straight down the toilet when an unmanned train carrying toxic chemicals rages through western Pennsylvania.  Such things as story, character development, and even the laws of physics to a degree are inconsequential.  Despite that though, Unstoppable somehow manages to work regardless.  Washington and Pine are both insanely likeable, the action is wonderful, and the film is surprisingly suspenseful as well.  Rosario Dawson is also on board as a driven operator guiding our heroes along, and she fares better than anyone else here other than our two heroes.  All in all, Unstoppable is a fun blast while it lasts, and you can't really ask for much more than that.</p></body></html>

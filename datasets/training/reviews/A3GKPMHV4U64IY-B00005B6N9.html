<meta name="summary" content="Evil to the Rescue"></head><body><p>A starliner is struck by meteors and becomes a flying wreck.  Only a portion of the ship manages to land on a desolate planet.  One of the survivors is Richard P. Riddick who is a prisoner being transported by a bounty hunter who also survived.  The planet is arid and bright under three suns.  There is evidence that life once lived there as well as an abandoned scientific station.  An escape ship can be fixed with parts from the crash and a water generator can be fixed.  Seems like everyone will be able to get off the planet with a little work.<br /><br />But then trouble begins when one of the survivors enters a dark place.  There is still life around but it clings to the dark.  Not a problem with the three suns.  Not until someone discovers that the suns are all about to be blocked by a giant planet.  Soon darkness falls and only the strength and determination of a convicted felon will be able to pull anyone through as they must finish the repairs while fending off the night predators.<br /><br />According to some preview material when the movie was first released, Riddick is a government assassin who has outlived his mission but the government has been unable to eliminate him as he is too good.  This background gives one a different view of this movie.  The later additions to the series seem to have abandoned this idea.  Still, it is a good story of enlightened self interest.  Decent acting and good effects help drive this tale of survival.  Check it out.</p></body></html>

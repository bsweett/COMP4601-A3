<meta name="summary" content="Maybe the best horror film ever made"></head><body><p>I've loved this film for many years, so I thought it's about time I got around to reviewing it. Along with John Carpernter's other masterpiece, Halloween, The Thing is not only my favorite horror movie of all time, but it is in my top 5 if you include all genres. I was first introduced to this film by my mom when I was a teenager. She has loved it ever since she saw it in theaters back in 1982, so now I share the passion. What makes this flick so great? When there are more great things to say about a movie than fingers on your hands, you know it's something special. I'll just quickly talk about a some of them.<br /><br />The atmosphere is number one in my book. Isolated at a remote research facility in Antarctica creates an amazing claustrophobic setting. Tension really builds when you have no where to go. The music is undeniably one of the creepiest and most suspense building stuff you will ever hear. Ennio Morricone of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly fame creates another masterful composition here. Other than Jaws, no other film's score has done more with two bass notes. Fear of the unknown plays a huge part, especially the first time you see it (I wish I could erase the film from memory and watch it for the first time again). Not being able to trust anyone but yourself becomes the motto. The special effects are way before the days of CGI and 27 years later they still look very impressive. The gore level is quite high and disturbing. Some images will forever be burned in my mind. Maybe most importantly of all, this film is actually scary. I still get chills watching this alone at night with the lights off and I've seen it more than ten times. Just thinking about what might have went on at the destroyed Norwegian camp is enough to make the hairs on your arm stand up. There is not a weak link in the cast. Everyone is believable and you never for once think you are watching a bunch of actors. Even with someone as familiar as Kurt Russell, who wisely doesn't overplay the part. I also loved the ending. Sure it's a cliffhanger, but it still leaves that element of mystery that kept the movie going from the start. Pure class.<br /><br />So do you think I like John Carpenter's remake of The Thing? I was trying to think of some flaws, but a few minutes went by and I gave up. The bottom line is, this belongs in every DVD collection.<br /><br />The Blu-ray itself looks fantastic, especially when compared to the old 1998 release I have. It was worth the upgrade.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Worthwhile Indiana Jones/James Bond Hybrid"></head><body><p>"Sahara" is an Indiana Jones/James Bond hybrid that should be appreciated by fans of, say, "National Treasure" and "The Mummy" (1999), though it's not quite as good as either of those films.<br /><br />I was hoping it would be closer to the Clive Cussler novel, but the main elements of the story are there. Matthew McConaughey makes a decent enough Dirk Pitt (Cussler's hero in his book series), although I envisioned him with brouder shoulders and facial features more akin to Charles Bronson. Steve Zahn doesn't physically look like his sidekick Al Giordino (who is supposed to resemble a human bulldozer), but I enjoyed Zahn in the role. Penelope Cruz is also enjoyable as the W.H.O doctor.<br /><br />I'm a sucker for desert-adventure flicks (e.g. "Raiders of the Lost Ark," "Flight of the Phoenix," "The Mummy," "Lawrence of Arabia," etc.) and so really enjoyed the great desert scenery (from locations in Morocco and Spain).<br /><br />So why only 3 Stars? Mainly because the flick doesn't match the greatness of the novel, but also because of the many implausibilities (e.g. the escape from the pick-up truck, the absurd entrance into the desert facility, the soccer ball incident, just to name a few). In other words, the film often has a highly unrealisitic tone. Still, I enjoyed the fun, upbeat spirit of "Sahara," similar to Indiana Jones or the 70's/early 80's James bond flicks.<br /><br />If you haven't read the book it would be more like a 3.5 or 4 Star film.</p></body></html>

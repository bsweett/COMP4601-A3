But the star of this movie is the Twister and the effects it has on it surroundings. The special effects are great. I have heard some people say that the plot is not great....There is a love story, a healing of a pscological trauma and the story of what it is like to be a storm chaser.....So I think there is a plot with sub-plots involved. But when all is said and done, the twister steals the show.</p></body></html>

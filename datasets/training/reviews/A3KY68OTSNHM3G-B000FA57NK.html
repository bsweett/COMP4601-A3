<meta name="summary" content="Houston, We Have A Problem"></head><body><p>Houston, we have a problem.  Those five words sent chills through the NASA space center in April, 1970.  Apollo 13 had just lifted off on its voyage to the moon.  On board were Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert. Approximately halfway through the voyage, an explosin rocks the ship.  One of the oxygen tanks  burst as it was being stirred. The explosion crippled the ship and left the astronauts unable to land on the moon, and put their return to earth in jeopardy.  Tom Hanks (Lovell), Bill Paxton (Haise), and Kevin Bacon (Swigert) give riveting performances as the astronauts, and Ed Harris gives an Oscar-caliber performance as Gene Kranz.  Gary Sinise is also excellent as Ken Mattingly, originally scheduled to be on the misson, but was kept off due to  exposue to the measles.  However, Mattingly still played an important role in bringing the astronauts back to earth by working in the simulator to develop a plan to conserve the engegy aboard the L.E.M. so the computers could be powered up for re-entry.  Ron Howard does an excellent job with state of the art special effects which bring this apollo mission to life. Combining excellent acting, historical correctness, and edge-of-your-seat excitement, Apollo 13 is worthy of inclusion in any video collection.</p></body></html>

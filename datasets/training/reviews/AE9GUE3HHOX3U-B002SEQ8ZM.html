I would have rather had the voices in Coraline British, rather than English, it would have made the film a bit more mystical and intelligent sounding.  The plot was a bit confusing, you really have to pay attention.  I was more fixated on the beautiful, organic animation and vivid colours.  Coraline, Nitemare b4 X-mas, James and the Giant Peach and Corpse Bride are all fantastic films.  I hope they continue to make these types of films, the time they spend to make them is worth it.</p></body></html>

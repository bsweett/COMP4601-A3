<meta name="summary" content="Great adaptation of a landmark graphic novel."></head><body><p>"Watchmen" when it debuted in mid '80s was a groundbreaking event in the world of comics.  Along with Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight Returns" it began to change the fundamental perceptions of comics -- that they were strictly kid stuff.  "Watchmen" helped establish that the comic book medium could be used to tell serious, thoughtful, adult-themed stories, that discriminating readers could enjoy and appreciate.  Now that Hollywood has discovered comic books as a source of movie ideas, and each comic book adaptation comes practically tripping on the heels of its predecessor, I suppose it was only a matter of time before "Watchmen" was translated to the silver screen.  It was worth the wait in this case.<br /><br />Most people familiar with comics will be familiar with Alan Moore's very public comments repudiating this movie, sight unseen, even to the point of denigrating its director.  Alan Moore needs to get over himself.  I understand he has good cause to feel disappointed with Hollywood, given the awfulness of some previous adaptations of his work.  But he has overreacted, like a kid who wants to take his ball and go home now.  He has declared "Watchmen" to be "unfilmable," which is interesting, since he clearly didn't always feel that way.  He was reportedly "enthusiastic" back in the '80s when he first sold the film rights to "Watchmen."  If it wasn't unfilmable then, why would it be now?  Moore seems to have lost the ability to tell the difference between a bad storytelling medium, and a good storytelling medium badly employed, and now his disappointment has fermented into petulance.  It's really a shame, because a movie adaptation of his work has finally done it justice.  It's far from perfect, and no doubt even if this exact movie could have been made back when he still had enthusiasm for the project, he'd disagree with some of the director's decisions.  But as it is, he's ironically decided to turn his back on films only when at last someone's done a film adaptation of his work that he might actually have liked.  Pity.  It's his loss.<br /><br />This really is a good film.  It's about as faithful to the graphic novel as a film could possibly be, given the changes that have to be made to adapt it into a movie, and keep the movie to a reasonable run time that audiences will be able to sit through.  The cast is nearly perfect.  All of the actors turn in solid performances, and Jackie Earl Haley and Jeffrey Dean Morgan really stand out in their roles.  Their performances are two of the reasons this is such a good adaptation.  The audience ends up perceiving the characters in precisely the same way they came across in the graphic novel.  In the comedian's case, we see an amoral, sometimes vicious man, and yet strangely, while never approving of him, don't quite hate him the way we ought to hate someone who has done the things he has.  In Rorschach, who seems to be the most popular character in both the graphic novel and the movie, we see a character who maintains a very black/white view of the world and the moral choices it presents us, and who is totally uncompromising and true to his beliefs, even to the point of being willing to die for them rather than compromising.  Perhaps this level of integrity and moral courage, as well as pure, unflinching toughness, is what causes people to like a character who is anti-social and violent, and more than a little crazy.  The other characters are almost as well done, but those two really stand out.  Once again, despite the changes made to bring this story to film, Moore really ought to get off his high horse and enjoy the movie for what it is, which is, on the whole, a faithful, respectful adaptation, which keeps the story and its themes fully intact, even if some of the details have to be changed for the medium.<br /><br />Not everything is translated faithfully from the source material, however.  The ending is significantly altered, but this is not a change which seems to hurt the film at all.  In fact a considerable body of opinion exists that it actually improved the story.<br /><br />But nothing is perfect, and the "Watchmen" movie is no exception.  Other changes, though more minor, are not so beneficial.  One example of this is the extreme, brutally graphic violence of some of the scenes.  Dan and Laurie's fight with the gang of muggers in the alley is a lot bloodier than in the book.  And in the director's cut, the assassination attempt on Veidt in his office is a LOT more brutal.  In the novel, we see a gunman step into view, fire at Veidt, and hit his secretary with one shot, and she falls over dead.  In the director's cut of the movie, she gets his twice twice, in super slo mo, with close ups on the impacts, one of which takes off several fingers of her right hand.  Then another bullet hits Lee Iacocca right between the eyes (and he wasn't even in the book).  And for the life of me, I can't see any way in which all this extra carnage improves the story one jot.  It adds nothing whatsoever to the story.  And speaking of the scene with Iacocca, the insertion of him into this movie, in a scene where he and several other corporate CEOs confront Veidt is by far the worst scene in the movie.  It's such a hamfisted, childish caricature of the evil rich capitalist fat cat, right down to one of the sinister plutocrats sneering "Free energy?  Free's just another word for for socialist.  We may just have to look into some of your past associations."  It comes across as just what it is, a Hollywood liberal's fantasy of what a rich conservative corporate executive is.  And again, it adds nothing to the story.  More minor flaws include Snyder's trademark overuse of slow motion, and Silk Spectre's magic boots, which are stiletto-heeled in any scene where she's just walking or standing, but flat-heeled when she fights bad guys.<br /><br />Still the flaws are fairly minor.  And I suppose they -- the consequence of having Zack Snyder as director -- are the price we must pay for the good fortune of having Zack Snyder as a director.  It was probably inevitable that he would insert such things into the movie, but he was also one of the only directors who appreciated the the original story enough to keep the changes minor, and stay as faithful to the novel as he did.  The result is a great movie, which can be enjoyed even by people who never read the graphic novel, but which will also please the novels longtime and devoted fans.</p></body></html>

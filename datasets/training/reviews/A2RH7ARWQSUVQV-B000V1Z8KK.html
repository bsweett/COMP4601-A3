It is truly the worst movie that I've seen in some time.  It relies entirely on old Hollywood standbys--fatal wounds that the hero recovers from; car chase scenes; heroes that never miss; bad guys who always miss; sinister government plots; sinister FBI characters etc.<br /><br />It's an Oliver Stone film on crack.  There are echoes of "JFK" i.e. the three guys on the grassy knoll are buried in Terlingua.  "Hey, I've still got the shovel!"  There are even echoes of the Ruby Ridge massacre.  Our 'hero' is living way out in the woods.  The FBI shoots his dog.  Man, man, man, really original stuff.<br /><br />The plot is far too complex, far too complex to follow, but, not to worry, the director explains it in the end.  The government killed 400 villagers in Ethiopia so that an oil pipeline could go through [get that, folks, evil oil].  Now we don't quite know why they were killed but apparently it's so other villagers will get the message and just get up and move away.  Logical.  Our hero and his shooter friend, shoot Ethiopian retaliation forces but of this I was never clear.  Maybe they were they were shooting the bad guys who did the village murders and our hero, in turn, murders them as a cover-up.  Not to worry.  Our hero doesn't know who he's shooting, either, and, the government, rather than extract or heroes, shoots them up with a helicopter and his friend is killed.  Of course, as we are watching all this we have no clue as to what's happening...we have to wade through hours and hours of this turkey dreck hoping that maybe somebody will make sense of it.  Truly, they never really do.<br /><br />Our hero, after his return, is intelligently employed to detect a long range sniper trying to kill the President.  It's at an outdoor Presidential review featuring the archbishop of Ethiopia [is there an archbishop of Ethiopia?].  Boom! Goes a shot which we learn later, deliberately misses the President and kills the Ethiopian.  Perfect good sense. Suddenly the cops are shooting our hero--again, we have no way of knowing why.  Despite the fact that the hero is shot through the axillary artery, which would have killed him in minutes, and through the gut, which would have disabled him in hours, and killed him in a day or two, our super-hero soldiers on to kill thousands and thousands of bad guys [make that agents and U.S. soldiers] with rifles, pistols, machine guns, garrots, karote and miscellaneous bombs.<br /><br />Wow!!!  What a guy!  And he does all this while mumbling his lines which adds to the mystery of the whole thing.<br /><br />Now, a word for the writers, directors and producers, if they ever read these things.  Why in H... can't you use just a tad of originality?  Why does it always have to be all this Hollywood BS and tripe?  Are you imbeciles or just younger than 22?  Do you still have problems with acne?  Who are you going to vote for in November?  Yeah, I know, it's just a joke.  The whole stinkin' thing is a joke.  Get your stuff together, boys and girls.  You have nothing to lose but your American Civil Liberties card.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite</p></body></html>

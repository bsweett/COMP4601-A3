<meta name="summary" content="Low key but extremely effective indie film"></head><body><p>Directed by Terry Zwigoff (CRUMB) and scripted by Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes from the latter's comic book.<br />It is the early 80s, and punk rock has been replaced by new wave. Wannabe punk Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johnansen) are a pair of misfit best friends who reply to a personal ad as a prank. The victim turns out to be an eccentric loner named Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a guy who according to Enid is "such a dork, he's almost kind of cool". But when Enid and Rebecca start to drift apart after graduating high school, Enid ends up befriending Seymour; who lives for his LP collection and she soon finds in him a kindred spirit. Enid discovers she needs Seymour a lot more than she ever thought.<br />GHOST WORLD features a rather simple story (A basic but effective subplot involves Enid's interaction with an elderly man who is each day waiting for a bus which never seems to arrive) but one that is real and affecting. Both leads are great; especially Buscemi in what is for me his best role since RESERVOIR DOGS. GHOST WORLD is one movie you must see this year. One of Robert Crumb's drawings also appears in the film.</p></body></html>

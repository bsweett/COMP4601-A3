<meta name="summary" content="Good features, Stinky movie"></head><body><p>Let me say this:  based on supplemental features alone, this is probably a 4 star DVD.  There are many documentaries and such, though I must say Tim Burton is very annoying on the commentary track.  He seems to go on and on without really saying anything insightful.<p>The movie is a mess.  If you're familiar with the original film (it's hard not to compare the two), you know what an impact the ending has on the whole movie.  By trying to match that shocker ending, this new version COMPLETELY NEGATES the ENTIRE film that built up to it.  I defy anyone to actually make sense of it.  Not even Tim Burton could!  Sure, he said it made perfect sense to him-- but he didn't want to explain it for fear it would foul up Fox's plans for a sequel.<p>This is a completely disposable blockbuster.  Watch or re-watch the original, or even it's sequels, before wasting time and/or money with this.</p></body></html>

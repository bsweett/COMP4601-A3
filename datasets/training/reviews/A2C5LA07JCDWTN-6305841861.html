<meta name="summary" content="So much better than the first..."></head><body><p>Basically the premise is exactly the same as the first Evil Dead film.  Ash and his girlfriend go up to spend the weekend at a deserted cabin that contains the book of the dead.  Evil Dead 2 is so much more accomplished in terms of special effects and cinematography.  Some of the shots in this film are nothing less than spectacular (when Ash gets hit by the evil force and gets driven through the forest at 100 mph).  The camera work is amazing and Raimi speeds up the film shots at exactly the right moments (when Ash's hand turns against him).  The ending is simply awesome and leads directly into Army of Darkness.  Evil Dead 2 has everything: lots of gore, some classic Ash lines, superb FX, and top notch cinematography.  Every true horror collector should own this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It Works"></head><body><p>This is a nicely animated film that appeals to the kids, but is also clever enough to sustain an adult through the feature.  There are really no surprises in the film, but it is a fun and good hearted story about an out of shape goofy panda with a destiny.  Taking a little bit of story from every Kung Fu picture you might have watched as a kid, the story moves along with plenty of action and the story of rising to the challange/becoming all you can be.  My son enjoyed the movie, and I found it amusing enough that I would buy it when it came out on Blu-Ray.  Watch the end credits to hear Jack Black sing Kung Fu Fighting and see how of the stars voices you figured out during the movie.</p></body></html>

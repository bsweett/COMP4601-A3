<meta name="summary" content="Good movie"></head><body><p>I don't think I've ever seen any Friday 13th movies growing up. But I did hear about them. Walmart had a sale on the Friday 13 movie in Oct. I like scare movie's so I jumped on buying the first three. I have so many dvd's that I just got around to watching the first movie today. I enjoyed it, but hate watching movies that are pitch black and all you can see is a few lights. I don't know if it was my flat scene tv or the movie. But those parts sucked.</p></body></html>

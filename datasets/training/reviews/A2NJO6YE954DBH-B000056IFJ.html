<meta name="summary" content="The Terminator's coming to get you Sarah..."></head><body><p>Looking back almost twenty years to James Cameron's 1984 film, &quot;The Terminator&quot; almost seems quaint.  Given the special effects that would dominated not only its two sequels but just about every other big budget action film to come down the pike, there is an almost brutal simplicity to the original offering.  Lacking the computer generated effectives, more expensive production values, and the self-reflexivity of the two sequels, &quot;The Terminator&quot; simply strikes me as being the best of the bunch.  There was a lot of creativity and thought put into &quot;Terminator II,&quot; but this one has the better story.<p>If you think back to 1984 then what we have in this movie is a combination of key elements from &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;Halloween.&quot;  From the former we get the idea of a relentless killing machine that stops at nothing, while from the latter comes the fact that somebody who knows you is out to get you for reasons that you do not know and none of the tradition tools of persuasion, such as knives and automatic weaponry have any effect; like Michael Meyers this guy keeps getting back up.  &quot;The Terminator&quot; now acknowledges the work of Harlan Ellison, whose teleplays of &quot;Solider&quot; and &quot;Demon With a Glass Hand&quot; on &quot;Outer Limits&quot; are clearly antecedents for this tale, but in many ways Cameron's movie is a high-tech slasher film.  Keep in mind that his previous directorial effort was &quot;Piranha Part Two: The Spawning,&quot; and from this film he moved on to &quot;Aliens.&quot;  It was not really until &quot;The Abyss&quot; that Cameron's films started evidencing a sense of the truly poetic (then again, there is the Polaroid photograph in this one).<p>The premise is simple and direct.  Two naked guys show up in Southern California.  One of them tears a page out of the phone booth and starts killing women named Sarah Connor.  However, there is one more name and address on that list and she is the true target of what is happening.  By now both of the naked men are dressed and the other one saves her from the killing machine, at which point she finds out it really is a killing machine.  Not only that, it has been sent back from the future for the sole purpose of making sure she ends up dead.  Furthermore, it turns out the stakes are a whole lot higher than that as well.<p>Much is made about the title character being played by the (almost) current governor of California, and while this was certainly a breakthrough performance for Arnold Schwarzenegger (at least for those who never saw &quot;Pumping Iron&quot;), the story is still the more important element.  Cameron knows how to have exposition double up for explanation, especially when yelled by a character during a car chase, and that most of his audience are not hard-core hard-science science-fiction fans who enjoy a good time travel paradox narrative, whatever the problems in logic and physics.  <p>As Cameron would prove again in &quot;Aliens,&quot; he knows how to push down on the pedal and pour on things at the end to give us the thrill of several &quot;what next?&quot; moments.  Also, he maintains the Dionysian sense of gloom until the end of the film.  In fact, that is true of the entire trilogy, which has ended the series without every providing a moment when the lead character and the rest of us can believe that things are going to be okay.</p></body></html>

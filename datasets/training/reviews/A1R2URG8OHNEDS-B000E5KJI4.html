<meta name="summary" content="One of My Favorite Stories!"></head><body><p>The story of the Trojan War is one of my favorites. I havn't read the actually poam of The Iliad, but I read an easier version, and thought that the story was great. When I heard that it was going to become a movie, "Troy", I was very excited. When I heard that it was going to star Brad Pitt, that irked me a little bit. I learned that it was going to be 165 minutes, close to three hours. I began to think it was going to be a new great epic. This movie had everything going for it, and I thought it was going to become a five star wonder, but it actually fell short by one star. The one star was lost, mostly because of Brad Pitt. The movie got greta star power because of Eric Bana, who I noticed from "Hulk" which came out last summer. <p>The movie begins in the 12th century BC. The army of King Agamemnon wants to expand his land and take over Greece. Agamemnon calls for Achilles, who is supposed to be the greatest warrior alive who has no weaknesses, to fight Thessaly, a part of Greece they want. They take over, but Agamemnon needs to call him again and bring him to Troy. Prince Paris has fallen in love and taken Agamemnon's brother Menelaus's wife Helen, and has brought her back to his homeland of Troy. Paris' brother Hector doesn't want any problems, and tries to make his father Priam, the king, to send her back to home on a ship. Agamemnon decides to help his brother, after finding out that he if takes Troy he will have taken over Greece. The Greeks assemble 1000 ships, and head out to Troy to get Helen back to her home, along with Odysses, who becomes a sort of leader to the Trojans.<p>"Troy" was a well made movie, with a kind of "Lord of the Rings" fashion with the battle scenes and some of the camera angles. It also had a great score, and the three hours felt like it was only about ninety minutes. The time just flew by. The problem was Brad Pitt. He did not make a good Achilles, and he kind of killed the entire movie. He lost the movie an entire star. I have only seen one movie with Brad Pitt, and that is "Oceans 11." He also kind of killed that movie. A minor problem is that the nudity in this movie is pointless. They could have showed everything they needed to without the nudity. "Troy" focused more on the romance of these figures, and not on the war. There was a heart in Achilles, but Brad Pitt couldn't show heart in this character. I enjoyed "Troy" but a better Achilles would have made it great.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated R for graphic violence and some sexuality/nudity.</p></body></html>

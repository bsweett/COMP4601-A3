<meta name="summary" content="Broken"></head><body><p>The smiling and weeping masks of the Greek stage are meant to symbolize the two most basic branches of theatrical art: tragedy and comedy.  Although this kind of brutal distinction is hard to endorse in today's age of tragi- and dark comedies, it does serve as a reminder that you should know what you're getting.  Screenwriters should know what kind of emotional notes they're trying to strike, and audiences should know, going into a film, what sort of empathies they're expected to give up to the screen.<br /><br />"The Break-Up" may have been attempting a tragic-comic tone, but I doubt it.  And if it was, it failed miserably.  The best dark comedies only work because the darkness itself is meant to be funny, and vice versa.  In "The Break-Up," the two elements - the laughable and the lamentable - aren't mixed, they aren't juxtaposed, and they aren't even set up as flipsides of the other.  They hardly seem to be aware that the other is even there.<br /><br />It's all in the title.  Gary (Vince Vaughn) and Brooke (Jennifer Aniston) are breaking up.  In fact, they DO break up.  (This is not a spoiler.  If you protest, I suggest you read the title of the film again.)  Most of the movie deals with the reality of a relationship on the skids, but in this case a large part of the tension comes from the fact that neither party is willing to move out of or give up the wonderful condo they found and decorated together.  They circle around each other, growling and gnashing their teeth, all while hiding their most vulnerable spots from plain sight.  Gary buys a pool table that Brooke steadfastly refused to allow in the domicile.  Brooke walks around nude to show Gary what he's missing.  Things escalate.<br /><br />Break ups, generally speaking, aren't the funniest of things, especially if they're played straight-faced, and this is about as straight-faced as it gets.  Some elements are unique (Brooke allows her ambiguously gay brother's accapella group -- the Tone Rangers -- to practice in her room, disrupting Gary's sleep), others are derivative (the Game Night scene where the couple fights over a game of Pictionary comes straight out of an episode of The Simpsons).  Most of them are just plain hateful, and I'm talking about every true-to-life yelling match the two get into over the course of the movie.<br /><br />Taken as a case study, it may have proven to be a telling (if not a particularly ground-breaking) look at relationship dynamics.  But Diirector Peyton Reed, perhaps afraid of being too spot-on, tried to balance out the film's black heart with some sincerely funny side elements.  Gary's brothers - the lecherous Lupus (Cole Hauser) and the perpetually awkward Dennis (played ingeniously by Vincent D'Onofrio) - provide moments of relief.  So does Gary's best friend, Johnny O (another great performance by Jon Favreau).  Jason Bateman has a few wonderful moments as the real estate agent, Riggleman.  Even Brooke's boss (the skin-n-bones Judy Davis) and her coworker (Justin Long) offer us a much-needed respite from the break-up's torturous emotional melodrama.<br /><br />But it's not enough, really.  And more importantly, it's distracting.  That was probably the point.  These two people are really and truly breaking up, and the movie fails to explain why that's supposed to be entertaining or even interesting.  Most of us look away or get up and leave when confronted with a self-destructing relationship.  We don't stick around to watch the flames burn themselves out.  "The Break-Up" is a tragedy, but it doesn't want to be, and so it entreats us to stay and watch by offering us a few chuckling crumbs.  Is it tragic?  Absolutely.  Is it funny?  At times.  Is it both things together?  Let's just say that when you try to wear two masks at the same time, neither one fits very well.</p></body></html>

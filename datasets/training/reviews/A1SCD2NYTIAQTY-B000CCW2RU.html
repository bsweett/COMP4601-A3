<meta name="summary" content="Why white??"></head><body><p>One of the questions asked by Lincoln 6 Echo when he starts to question the post-contamination as he launches into a criticism of his surroundings. "The Island" is a movie that was something of a surprise to me, and a good one at that.<br /><br />The world has been largely wiped out by some contamination, and the only survivors live in a utopian compound where a lottery chooses some to go to the only uncontaminated place left on Earth: The Island. The inanity of the utopian life is poignant, made more so in Lincoln 6 Echo's concern over the loss of one of his white shoes, (another colour would be nice, he comments).<br /><br />Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are both surprising in the ways in which they adapt to the roles. McGregor, who usually comes across as a bit spineless in some roles, makes a good show of it later in this film. His change of character typing was excellently done. Johansson, perceived as somewhat more suited to the quiet, light comedy roles of "Lost in Translation", makes the jump to sci-fi actioner easily, becoming a definite action queen. Both of them did exceptionally well in this role.<br /><br />The special effects are awesome, making the film all the more realistic and impacting. The use of the natural light to bring across a warm and hazy glow of summer also added something to the overall feel of the movie. Among the sci-fi movies of recent times, I would rank "The Island" as among the best for technical quality.<br /><br />While the plot starts off with some surprises, keeping the viewers in suspense, the later parts descend into somewhat cliched and corny lines. The ending itself was somewhat overdone and superficial, which did not enhance the movie itself. However, the previous couple of hours were so good that I found myself not minding the film's plummet into predictable sentimentality so much.<br /><br />Bottom line, I really liked the movie, and enjoyed watching a well-executed film that entertained and threw up some nice ethical questions to ruminate on.</p></body></html>

The year was 1979, and director/writer/composer John Carpenter was just coming off the massive success of &quot;Halloween&quot;. What does he do as a follow up to that groundbreaking classic?. Well, he makes another one!. He and his longtime collaborator Debra Hill wrote the script for an old fashioned scary ghost tale. Mission accomplished guys. The story takes place in the idyllic seaside town of Antonio Bay, California. The town is on the verge of celebrating it's 100th anniversary, being runned by local resident Kathy Williams, played by screen great Janet Leigh. At the same time as the big festivities are getting underway, the town is beset by a strange, eerie fog that is more than meets the eye. As we find out through Father Malone(Hal Halbrook), the town of Antonio Bay is built on greed, deceit, and murder. A group of long dead mariners are exacting their revenge on the town and the descendants of the men who originally did them wrong and built what was to become the town on their horrible actions. Now, they want what's rightfully theirs back. And they come in and do it engulfed in a dense, terrifying fog. Caught up in the terror is a small group of people. Local DJ Stevie Wayne(Adrienne Barbeau, who was Carpenter's real life squeeze), her son Andy, hitchhiker Elizabeth(Jamie Lee Curtis), Nick(Tom Atkins), and a few others as well. John Houseman appears in a small cameo at the beginning of the film. There are a few gags in the film that you need to look out for. The Tom Atkins character is named Nick Castle. Nick Castle is the actor who played Michael Myers in the original &quot;Halloween&quot;. There are a few others, but I will let you find them on your own. As I mentioned earlier, this movie is horribly overlooked and underrated. It may not be &quot;Halloween&quot;, but it is a strong try that is almost as equally creepy and suspense filled as that film. It is vintage John Carpenter, down to the cool score, and this was the last film he did that I think was truly scary. He also has a cameo early on in the film at the church playing the 'Bennet' character. The movie is tightly written by Carpenter and Hill, and it moves along at a nice pace and it gets you all settled into the nice town and the residents we soon meet. As always in Carpenter films, it really sets the mood and takes you into the movie itself. Carpenter has a special knack for ringing terror and suspense by actually making it creepy and scary without having to resort to &quot;jump scares&quot; or gore. This one is a perfectly executed film with a perfect balance of scares and a strong tale to go with it. Some people might find it surprising that Jamie Lee Curtis has a smaller, co-starring role here. Barbeau is the real star and heroine. But it's kinda funny because the original poster for the film showcased Jamie Lee and no one else. Misleading, yes, but with her rising fame at the time and the success of &quot;Halloween&quot; a year before, it was a nice marketing move. &quot;The Fog&quot; did okay at the box office, but it kinda got lost afterwards and created a following over the years. Carpenter should be noted for doing this film just as much as he is for doing &quot;Halloween&quot;. It's gotten a resurgence over the years, and you can tell the influence it had on Kevin Williamson for the &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; movie. All in all, &quot;The Fog&quot; is a real exercise in smart and upstanding terror. A classic thriller that is just waiting to be re-discovered again so it can scare the pants off you.</p></body></html>

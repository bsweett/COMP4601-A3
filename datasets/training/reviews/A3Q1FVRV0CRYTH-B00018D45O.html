Marcus Nispel delivers a clever, crisp, gritty as well as very scary reinterpretation of Hooper's 74 fright fest.  What makes this film equally as impressive is the on-spot acting of the cast, most of them unknowns besides Biel, Ermey and Balfour.  This film version still takes place in 73, still involves a group of teens, this time on their way to a Lynard Skynard concert, and they still pick up a hitchhiker that ends up leading them to their doom.  This time though they pick up a different kind of hitchhiker, and to me at least, it adds quite a bit to the intensity of the film.<br /><br />Nispel's version leaves all the macabre of the original behind but instead paints a much darker and grim picture.  Yes, the sheriff played by vet R. Lee Ermey is funny in a sick and twisted way, but even he leans more on the sick and twisted then down right funny.  This film paints the screen black from the beginning and does let up.  I feel that makes this a admirable adaptation because, instead of creating an exact replica it creates something new and fresh, and with all the potential horror films that fall short of expectations, this is a breath of fresh air, to actually get nervous instead of anxious.  Every shot can evoke a form of fear, the whole film carrying a feeling of claustrophobia and constant panic, lacing each frame with dim lighting and random shots of dismembered doll parts and animal carcasses, human and or animal bones and abandoned vehicles, all creating a constant sense of dread and misery.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, the acting is really spot-on.  A few scenes of over acting, but that's normal.  Biel really blew me away with her acting, but it was Ermey that stole the whole show.  He was brilliant as the sadistic cop who was even more terrifying than Leatherface.  I personally feel this to be a great compliment to the original, and whether you feel this is a better film or it pales in comparison, the best way to look at this is as a different film, that way you can enjoy them both as the masterpieces that they truly are.</p></body></html>

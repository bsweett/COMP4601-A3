<meta name="summary" content="Current &quot;Comedies&quot; Should be half as HOT!"></head><body><p>A ad for a current theatrical comedy touts it as being in the same &quot;gross-out&quot; league as &quot;National Lampoon's Animal House&quot; or the recent &quot;There's Something About Mary.&quot;  Well, I, for one,  do not find the childish antics of such fare to be worthy of my attention  or my dollars.<p>&quot;Some Like it Hot&quot; remains an all-time comic  tour de force with witty dialogue, side-splitting slapstick, and great work  from principals. <p>Jack Lemmon, who proved several years later his  dramatic range scores in his role as Jerry(Daphne).  His solution to the  &quot;marriage&quot; problem between his female alter-ego and the rich  playboy played by legendary funnyman Joe E. Brown is priceless.  <p>Tony  Curtis, who in drag resembles Eve Arden, shows his comic flair with a deft  impression of Cary Grant.  It was not until many years later, as the Boston  Strangler - in the film of the same name - would he receive praise for his  acting.  Curtis is great in &quot;HOT.&quot;<p>Finally, Marilyn Monroe is  magic as Sugar.  A much better actress than she is given credit, Monroe  brings childish charm and innocence in what was probably one of her best  characterizations.<p>&quot;Some Like it Hot&quot; has lost none of its  heat!</p></body></html>

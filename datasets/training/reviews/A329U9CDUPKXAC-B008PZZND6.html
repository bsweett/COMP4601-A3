<meta name="summary" content="It was good"></head><body><p>I read the book before the movie came out and my reaction was "They're making a movie on this?" It's just not that great of a story. Granted, the movie is better than the book. There are more characters. But still, it's just not that great. There's a lot of beautiful scenery in this movie though and good acting. Although I found Heath Ledger to be very difficult to understand half the time. I'd say this movie was good but not great.</p></body></html>

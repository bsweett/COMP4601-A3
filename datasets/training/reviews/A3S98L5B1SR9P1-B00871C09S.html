<meta name="summary" content="Rear Window"></head><body><p>James Stewart and Grace Kelly make a wonderful couple in this film. The mystery keeps you guessing until the end. While the focus is out the rear window of Stewart's New York City apartment, his relationship with Grace Kelly's socialite progresses and changes. My favorite aspect about this movie is the juxtapostioning of Stewart learning about his neighbors as he watches them with him seeing new aspects of his girlfriend's adventurous spirit that he didn't know existed.</p></body></html>

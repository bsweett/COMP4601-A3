Beautiful."></head><body><p>Cinderella Man is an extraordinary movie about an extraordinary man, James Braddock during an especially difficult time in America's history. It is deeply ingrained in the psyche of America to root for the underdog; for the comman man to make good. Indeed, it is the embodiment of the American Dream.<br /><br />This is the story of Jim Braddock: a hackneyed, washed-up boxer who, in the grips of the Great Depression, fights his way to the top of professional boxing, against all odds.<br /><br />Russell Crowe and Renne Zellwegger are very impressive in their roles, certainly headed for awards in this fine performance. The grittiness, hopelessness and desperation of depression America is powerfully portrayed in this beautiful film.<br /><br />Be prepared for a lump in your throat as you watch a beaten man fight for his family, his dignity and his country.</p></body></html>

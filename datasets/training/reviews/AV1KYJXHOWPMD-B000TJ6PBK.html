<meta name="summary" content="EXCELLENT NEW STEPHEN KING HORROR ADAPTATION!"></head><body><p>I watched this film in the theater last week and having read the brilliant short story (in Everythings Eventual) I knew this could either make a bad or good movie. When it was done, I loved it. The film stayed faithful to the short story and it rocked. I really liked the casting with very good actors like John Cusack (who was the sole performer for most of the film) and Samuel L. Jackson. The special effects were most convincing. To be honest, I liked the ending in the film better. I've been hearing in a few places that Stephen King recommends the film and I do to. This film washes away the shameful crap houses like Saw and Hostel and restores good supernatural horror to its place. Lastly I recommend both the book Everythings Eventual (it contains the short story) and this film (which I believe I like better).</p></body></html>

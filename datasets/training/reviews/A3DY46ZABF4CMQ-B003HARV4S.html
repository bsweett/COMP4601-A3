<meta name="summary" content=""Everything you have seen here has been an illusion""></head><body><p>The Illusionist is a fascinating film directed by Neil Burger (Interview with the Assassin) and starring Edward Norton (Fight Club), Jessica Biehl (Stealth), Paul Giamatti (Sideways), and Rufus Sewell (Tristan + Isolde).<br /><br />Norton plays magician Eisenheim in 19th century Vienna. The Crown Prince Leopold, played by Sewell, is offended by Eisenheim because of his sudden appeal to the masses, and particularly to his wife to be Sophie, played by Biehl, who happens to be Eisenheim's childhood darling and current love interest. Leopold hires Police Cheif Uhl, played to perfection by Giamatti, to pursue Eisenheim and destroy his legacy.<br /><br />The film is filled with stunning visual effects, as well as many plot twists and surprises along the way.<br /><br />The best thing about the film, however, is the performance of the entire cast, particularly Norton and Giamatti who could easily recieve Oscar nods.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B+</p></body></html>

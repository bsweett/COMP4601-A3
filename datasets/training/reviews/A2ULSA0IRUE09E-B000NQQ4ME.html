<meta name="summary" content="Gory, Overwrought Nonsense : Gibson has finally lost it"></head><body><p>I don't know whether Mel Gibson had "It" to begin with, but who cares, because he's officially lost it with this meandering, heartless film about the decline of the Mayan civilization. Whether or not the actual Mayan civilization was like this is of course open to debate (and historians HAVE been debating this over and over since the films' release) - but what we have here borders on lunacy (and not even in a nice way).<br /><br />The story is simple - a tribe is captured to be offered as sacrifice to the Mayan Gods, and one man (i.e "The Chosen One" like Neo from "The Matrix") saves them all (sort of). Well at least he manages to save himself and his family. There is even a ridiculous child Oracle (again, like "The Matrix") who predicts the coming of the Chosen One.<br /><br />Thrown in an Eclipse, a black Jaguar, some quicksand, and lots of blood and hearts (literally) thrown around, and you have "Apocalypto" down pat. This is not a film for the faint of heart, but its not much of a film either. Rudy Youngblood (who is busy convincing us all in real life of his Native Indian roots) plays the young man who is the Neo of his generation, and the second half descends into a senseless chase - one disaster after the other, and oh, did I mention the blood and visceral body parts?<br /><br />The sad part of this whole thing is that it *could* have been tolerable had we given this project to a better director. Mel Gibson clearly has problems with race, religion and the universal belief system. At the end, the Mayans come across as Godless, barbaric and mindless creatures who 'deserved' to be conquered by the white race. Obviously this is not a good message.<br /><br />A very poor film - even purely as an action film, it falters quite badly. Very mildly recommended. Also, I thought the casting was WAY off - not at all convincing.</p></body></html>

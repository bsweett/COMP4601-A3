<meta name="summary" content="A superb legal thriller, with unforgettable performances"></head><body><p>Michael Clayton isn't a miracle worker; he's more like a janitor.  He fixes situations for his law firm.  Well, something has just come up that's completely out of his league: A senior partner, one of the firm's most respected members, has gone crazy, in the midst of a devastating lawsuit.  But is he really crazy?  Or could he be onto the truth...<br /><br />I really give this movie 4 1/2 stars.  I don't know why I'm not giving it five; maybe I should.  I'll leave that up to you--four or five stars, right now it doesn't make much difference.  I loved this movie, and I'm pretty sure you will to, if this is your bag.  If you're not a fan of thinking-man's thrillers, then avoid "Michael Clayton" at all costs.  This isn't your laywer-yelling-in-a-courtroom legal thriller.  In fact, you can make an argument that this isn't even a legal thriller.<br /><br />What drives this movie is one thing: acting.  Let's start with Tom Wilkinson, who delivers a knockout performance.  Tilda Swinton is also amazing; she's not too sympathetic (would've liked to have seen a bit more character depth) but she makes the absolute best of what she's been given.  The real star of course is George Clooney (when isn't he?).  His performance as the title character is probably one of his best yet.  It's a hard role to play--he isn't exactly a "good" guy, yet has to be sympathetic to the audience--but he nails it perfectly.  And when Swinton and Clooney go head-to-head in the climactic scene...wow.  That's a doozy of a climax; I'd love to see an action movie, with all their bullets and explosions, top the fire in Clooney's eyes.  I may sound like I'm star-struck, but hey, watch the movie and tell me I'm wrong.  Just so long as you watch it.</p></body></html>

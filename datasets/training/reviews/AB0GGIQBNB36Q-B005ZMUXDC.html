And when I write a review, I usually don't put a spiritual spin on things. But this movie leaves me no choice, as an Apostolic Pentecostal. This movie offended me, and my wife. I find it interesting that Disney, and most people today. Say that the hair means nothing, but that's not true. The Bible is very specific about a woman's hair, and I find it interesting that those who defend the short brown hair look. Over look the fact, that after that happens. Rapunzel is the one who asks Flynn to marry her, not the other way around. Which by the way, is a feminist view on things. I'll get comments for that. How dare the man be the one to ask, woman are equal to men. Said sarcastically, and yes. The mother figure, portrayed as being evil, is killed. But it's okay to disobey, because we don't believe in absolutes anymore. such as, an authority figure can't tell me what to do, I'm my own person. I would say, if you want to enjoy good Disney movies. Watch the ones from the 60's, 70's, and 80's. And a few from the 90's, by the way, for those who defend this movie, it's not even close to the original story of Rapunzel. Just a thought.</p></body></html>

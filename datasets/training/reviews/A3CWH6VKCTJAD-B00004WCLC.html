<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant, but less would have been more"></head><body><p>Magnolia is one of those films where less would have been more.  In  attempting to do so much, the film actually suffered from excessive  brilliance.  Paul Thomas Anderson gives us a powerful auteur piece that  succeeds on most levels, but comes up short of its true potential.<p>The  story follows one day in the lives of nine major characters and a host of  minor ones whose lives are loosely connected to one man by various threads.  Anderson does inspired work, giving us deep character development for each  of the nine.  Many themes run through the work, but the most pervasive is  that of guilt and remorse.  Moreover, almost every effort at atonement was  rejected or thwarted in some way, evoking great pathos and a sense of  despondent fatalism.  This is clearly some of the best and most thought  provoking dark writing ever done.<p>From a directorial standpoint, the film  was a magnificent display of directorial virtuosity.  Anderson handled  scenes, actors and visual details with the flair of a maestro.  The swirl  of scenes from character to character, the use of the camera and music, the  juxtaposition of scenes, everything was superbly done.  Yet, the whole was  less than the sum of the parts due to Anderson's inability to let go of  elements that encumbered the film (an irony since one of the main themes of  the story was about being able to let go).  <p>Michaelangelo once commented  that inside every block of marble, there is a masterpiece, and the sculptor  needs only cut away the right pieces.  Editing is one of most excruciating  tasks of an auteur since each excision discards part of his soul.  However,  stoical editing is the area that differentiates great writer/directors from  the good ones.<p>This film had everything necessary to be one of the truly  great films of our times, but it suffered from excess.  There were too many  characters.  The story would have lost almost nothing by eliminating Donnie  (William Macy), Officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) and Claudia (Melora  Walters).  These characters really didn't add that much to the  philosophical points being made in the film and made the film unwieldy.  This would have trimmed forty-five minutes to an hour from the film and  turned the focus more on the relationship between Earl Partridge (Jason  Robards) and his son Frank (Tom Cruise) that was the very best element of  the film.<p>Also, Anderson went overboard on the profanity.  I am no prude  in this regard.  I believe that profanity adds realism to a film because  people are frequently profane in real life.  I disdain the self-righteous  prigs who are offended by it.  However, overuse of any device to the extent  that it starts to burden the story ultimately detracts from it.  Anderson  crossed that line.  It seemed like he was trying to set a record for  frequency and volume of vulgar expletives.  If all the profanity were  edited out, the film would have been 30 minutes shorter and Julianne Moore  would have had about five lines.<p>Finally, the plague of the frogs taken  from Chapter 8 of Exodus was ill advised, as was the chorus of song by all  the major characters at their point of greatest despondency.  Anderson was  trying to make important points with both of these devices, but in the  process, they trivialized an exceptionally powerful drama to the point of  eye rolling incredulity.<p>Anderson was so uncompromising about every  detail of his artistic vision that he missed the Big Picture (pun  intended).  The final version that was released would have been better  released later as the director's cut.  If Anderson had edited the  theatrical release effectively, he could have had it both ways.  He could  have had a commercial success, critical acclaim, and he still could have  given people an opportunity to see his entire vision.  <p>As to the acting,  this is probably the best ensemble performance I have ever seen.  Tom  Cruise was nominated for a best supporting Oscar and much as I love Michael  Caine and his performance in "The Cider House Rules", this was no contest.  Cruise was electrifying.  This was one of his best performances ever.  I  also thought Jason Robards' performance was worthy of supporting actor  nomination.  He was tremendous as the dying patriarch.  The rest of the  cast was phenomenal without exception.<p>It is easy to understand why this  film failed at the box office (at $23M, it grossed $14M less than its $37M  budget).  It was far too abstruse, intense, dark, philosophical and wry  (not to mention lengthy) to have popular appeal.  Of those who actually saw  it, most either loved it or hated it.  I must admit to feeling both  emotions.  I loved its genius but I hated that its final form didn't do  that genius justice.  Thus, I rated it an 8/10.  It will undoubtedly become  a cult classic rather than the true classic it could have been.</p></body></html>

Gymnastics is the classic, and most widely-publicized, example thanks to a few Eastern European tyrant coaches, but figure skating and ballet are two others that come to mind pretty readily. You have to wonder how much Andres Heinz (whose only previous credit is as director; he was responsible for the highly underrated 1998 film The Origin of the Species), who wrote both the original story upon which this film is based and co-wrote the screenplay adapted from it, was thinking of Bela Karolyi when creating the character of Tomas. Vincent Cassel, who plays Tomas, has said in interviews he was thinking Balanchine, natch, but IMDB reports the original script was theatrical, not ballet-based, so I'm giving Heinz a little more leeway in his influences. One way or the other, what we have here in Black Swan is a typical "girl coming out of her shell" script... but then, nothing is typical in the world of Darren Aronofsky. The word "visionary" is overused indeed when it comes to directors, but look at what Aronofsky and the stable he keeps close around him (most notably composer Clint Mansell, who once again turns in a top-notch score) have accomplished in the past ten years and tell me it doesn't apply. Where body-horror auteur David Cronenberg abandoned body horror when he moved onto his brilliant realist films of the past decade, Aronofsky has spent the same decade figuring out how to integrate Cronenberg's vision of body horror into realistic movies. (Think about Jared Leto's arm during the last half-hour of Requiem for a Dream.) Black Swan, with everything from its depictions of common ballet injuries to the infamous final scene of the trailer, is his fullest realization of Cronenberg's tradition yet. And yet no one could ever possibly mistake this for a David Cronenberg film; it is Darren Aronofsky through and through.<br /><br />Nina Sayers (The Professional's Natalie Portman, recently of The Other Boleyn Girl) is a ballet dancer. She's dedicated, but she hasn't garnered the respect that her mother (The Last Temptation of Christ's Barbara Hershey) thinks she deserves. Is she right? (Note that she says Nina is the company's most dedicated dancer, not their most talented.) We don't know, not really. I'm assuming you, like me, are not a ballet dancer yourself. One way or the other, though, Tomas (Cassel, recently of Cronenberg's Eastern Promises), the tyrannical head of the company, decides to cast Nina in the lead role in his new, "stripped down, real" production of Swan Lake over the girl he'd previously chosen, Veronica (the gorgeous Ksenia Solo, in her first big-screen role since 2003's The Republic of Love). We find out quickly enough that he has a number of reasons for this, very few of which seem to have to do with Nina's innate talent. In fact, he tells her on a number of occasions that while her icy control is perfect for the role of the white swan, there's not enough true passion in her to correctly dance the role of the evil-twin black swan. And thus, as I said at the beginning, the story of the girl coming out of her shell. She's helped along by Lilly (The Book of Eli's Mila Kunis), the troupe's newest member, as well as by Tomas' attempts at seduction and her finally deciding that her mother's stifling her. But as the pressure mounts, Nina finds herself moving farther and farther from the world of the stripped-down and the real...<br /><br />Fifteen year ago, Vincent Cassel--son of the great French actor Jean-Pierre Cassel--popped up in Mathieu Kassovitz' first film, La Haine, playing a wannabe gangster, racist, and all-around scummy guy. He was absolutely brilliant, and it was obvious that of the trio of leads from that movie, Cassel was going to be the one who would go on to at least indie stardom. (Hubert Kounde is doing a successful turn in French television these days, while Said Tagmoui has become a reliable character actor). Since then, Cassel has made some resounding successes (Sheitan, Eastern Promises) and some dismal failures (Derailed, anything with the word "Ocean's" in its title), but never has he owned a role the way he did Vinz... up to now. Tomas is slick where Vinz was rough, but the same snake writhes under the surface, and Vincent Cassel knows how to play that snake. Moreover, Cassel was about as perfect a choice for the role as one could get; he's sexy, but in that low-rent way that turns so well into disgusting-homeless-guy (viz. Sheitan). He's not a classy seducer, he's rough sex in smoke-filled bathrooms (viz. Irreversible, and I will leave you to decide whether that was a success or a failure). But Tomas is, in the small world of his ballet company, a rock star, and Nina sees none of that griminess both inherent in Tomas and that Cassel brings to the role. On the other side of the coin you have Lilly, for whom the term "low rent" could have been coined. She says "bad influence" from the moment you meet her, with those big black wings tattooed on her back, and you know that if Nina gets tangled up with her, things will not end well. But you also know that Nina, so desperate to get out from under her mother's thumb, is absolutely going to get tangled up with Lilly.<br /><br />What I'm telling you here, other than that if Vincent Cassel doesn't pick up a Best Actor nom a lot of people in the Academy should be dropped off moving buses, is that there's nothing here you haven't seen before, nothing you haven't read in a dozen Angela Carter fairy-tale retellings. Hell, nothing you don't know from Swan Lake, except that it would be quite a stretch of the imagination to cast either Tomas or Lilly in anything other than a shade of grey far deeper than that to which Nina's clothes have progressed by the end of the film. This movie doesn't deserve the slew of Oscars it should get because it's telling you an original story. It deserves them because of how Aronofsky is telling you that story, because of all the little touches far more subtle than split toenails and tattoos of black wings. Because, according to IMDB, Aronofsky was actively pitting Portman and Kunis against one another backstage to heighten tension on the set. Because the physical-therapy scene was real (Portman dislocated a rib onset). Because everyone in this movie nails their roles (and did I neglect to mention Winona Ryder as the bitter drunk ex-principal, and all the glorious meta under the hood there?). Because even though you have to know what's coming on some level, especially after that last scene in the hospital where Aronofsky comes so dangerously close to overplaying his hand, that last scene in the dressing room still comes as enough of a surprise that you realize that, as in all the best films of this type, you were hoping Aronofsky would cheat and hand you a different climax, even though that would have made this not nearly as good a film as it is. (And come on, did you really expect the guy who gave you Jennifer Connelly cuddling with a bag of heroin, blissful expression on her face, at the end of Requiem for a Dream--and the dirty, disgusting, utterly sexy scene before it--to pull a single punch anywhere in this film? It is testament to the greatness of Darren Aronofsky that I most certainly did.) Because of the delicious little details. ("What happened?" "[sigh] I have a life. You work too hard.") Because Black Swan is the best thing I've seen on the big screen in first run since El Laberinto del Fauno four years ago, and the best film I've seen in any format from 2010 (to be fair, as of this writing, I haven't yet seen the two films that word on the street says may beat it for the Oscar, The King's Speech and Blue Valentine, nor have I seen Poetry). Because Darren Aronofsky did what I didn't think he could: he made a better film than Requiem for a Dream. It is not a perfect film, but it's as close to it as America has seen in ten years. It is beautiful and brutal and deeply, deeply affecting, and you must see it. **** ?</p></body></html>

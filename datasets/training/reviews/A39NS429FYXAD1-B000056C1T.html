You might enjoy it more, oddly enough, if you watch the Commentary track FIRST...perhaps then you will be swept up in the filmmakers' enthusiasm for their project.<br /><br />Why did the screenwriter feel he needed to fictionalize everyone but Cornwallis!?  Like TITANIC, there are plenty of fasconating REAL characters of import.  This is like RAMBO VISITS LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE.  Any second I thought Nellie Oleson would ride into the scene.  Mel Gibson acts all over the place, seeming to be looking for that Oscar.  Jason Isaacs does everything but twirls a handlebar moustache as the villain.  Only Chris Cooper and Tom Wilkinson manage to turn in performance that strike realistic chords, rising above cliche.  John Williams seems to have scored this one in between appointments...very generic, unremarkable melodies.  The cinematography and special effects, however, are top notch....although every time the action drfited into Slow Motion, I kept thinking how LONG it already was at 2:40:00.  In fact, the story itself doesn't pick up until close to the second hour.<br /><br />More about vengeance and less about patriotism.  Still, if the genre appeals to you it will bring you viewing pleasure.  Personally, I'd prefer a good documentary on the Revolutionary War.<br /><br />Pet peeve: the subtitles do not accurately match the dialogue.</p></body></html>

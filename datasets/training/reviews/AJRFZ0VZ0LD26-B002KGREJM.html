<meta name="summary" content="Authoritarian power"></head><body><p>Perhaps the best way to start this review is to praise Forest Whitaker and Gillian Anderson on their powerful performances in this movie.  Both have delivered strong characters with grace and poise.  Their accents are impeccable and portrayal of Ugandan leader Idi Amin is chilling to say the least.  Filmed from the perspective of young Scottish doctor who ends up being Amin's personal physician this portrayal of the heartless charismatic leader from an African country is unique.  It seamlessly portrays Amin's rise to power and his decline as his authoritarian regime swallows all around him, including the closest government advisors and even his family members.  Narrated from the perspective of foreigner, an outsider, young and naive Scottish doctor, gives this portrayal humanity.  No matter how flowed our young doctor is,  there is no way to justify atrocities that surround him and torture that he personally experiences.  Definitely film for young children, but absolute must for anyone interested in Africa, power and story about failed dictatorship inside an independent country trying to define itself in a new, post-colonial world.</p></body></html>

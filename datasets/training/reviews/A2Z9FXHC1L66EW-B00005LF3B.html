His films have been critically acclaimed as well as hugely successful, ranging from modest (That Thing You Do! &amp; The Green Mile) to Box Office Kings (Forrest Gump &amp; Saving Private Ryan).  How does he do it?<p>Well with Cast Away, Mr. King Midas strikes Gold again, with a simple tale of a man who crash lands on an island and must survive it's hardships for four years.  Sounds simple, huh?  And you might think a movie, even with Hanks in it, about one person on an island for most of the time may seem boring.  Not a chance.  Cast Away breaks down the human being in us all and lets us discover who we truly are inside, by watching Chuck Noland (NO LAND) discover for himself what it takes to sustain his own life and well being.  The love for a woman he left behind, that he looks at with a picture in a pocket watch she gave him when last they were together.  There are layers and layers of depth to this piece that is so compelling, if you're not emotional by the end, check yourself for a pulse.  <p>Those that love this film have already fallen in love with Wilson, a vollyball with a bloodpainted face, drawn by Chuck, to have as a companion.  Sounds nuts, you say?  Try being alone for four years and see how long it takes you to make up a friend to talk to.  Wilson represents Chuck's hopes and determination in himself.  He needs Wilson to be there.  I have never gottan more choked up over a vollyball in my entire life, but when you watch that one scene on the raft, well, your heart just breaks...and I know it's crazy because Wilson is not a real person...or is he?<p>Anyone who scoffs at the ending are really too busy to take the time to get the point of what Cast Away is all about.  I am so tired of these cute little endings where the guy gets the girl in the end, when in reality, we all know it doesn't always work out that way.  But you take from Cast Away what you bring to it, and that's what the ending is about.  Which direction to take now?  Not sure.  But at least &quot;Tomorrow the sun will rise&quot;.<p>The DVD extras are FANTASTIC.  So many featurettes that don't feel like featurettes..they feel like short documentaries..and there's even one all about Wilson!  But my favorite is the Charlie Rose interview with Hanks, who is such a delight..it's truly a great interview.  I really wish he could've participated in the audio commentary, but he's so busy.  One mistake I noticed..the details on the back of the case state that Cast Away is presented in anamorphic widescreen with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1, which is incorrect..it's only 1.85:1.  But with tons of trailers and interviews and featurettes, it really makes little difference to me.<p>Grab this movie on DVD, and get ready for an experience you'll never forget.  And Mr. Hanks?  May your streak of hits never end!</p></body></html>

Space Cowboys) has directed for many years and this film is one of the best Who Done It - I have seen in along time. He makes you guess and guess and guess. Just when you thought you figured it out - Wrong! I even got mad at myself watching this because I thought I was pretty sharp...but....oh well.<p>This film is well crafted and very intricate in the story. I really admire Kevin Bacon's (Footloose, Wil & Grace, Apollo 13, The River Wild) for his performance as the straight lace detective of the group of three boys who grew up with a very common episode that happened in their lives as kids.<p>Sean Penn (I Am Sam, State of Grace, Thin Red Line) give an incredible performance as a father who has a tragedy happen to him and makes choices that affect everyone's life. He is scary in this film.<p>Tim Robbins give a stellar performance the boy with the past who haunts his future and creates a situation that he can not control. He is a nut - with a twist...and the stunning performance by his wife played by -Marcia Gay Harden (Space Cowboys, Flubber) makes you feel even more creepy.<p>Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix 1,2 & 3, Event Horizon) gives a great compliment to being Kevin bacons partner.<br />It is truly a mystery within a mystery. Set in today's world of CSI and crime solving Real TV environments - this puts a new twist on who you think did it.<p>Beautifully photographed and stunning camera work make this a very intriguing mystery. Love to see this one again. You should too.</p></body></html>

This is how the story goes: The ultimate struggle for power pits men against kings and kings against gods. But the war between the gods themselves could destroy the world. Born of a god but raised as a man, Perseus is helpless to save his family from Hades, vengeful god of the underworld. With nothing left to lose, Perseus volunteers to lead a dangerous mission to defeat Hades before he can seize power from Zeus and unleash hell on earth. Leading a daring band of warriors, Perseus sets off on a perilous journey deep into forbidden worlds. Battling unholy demons and fearsome beasts, he will only survive if he can accept his power as a god, defy his fate and create his own destiny.<br /><br />The cast led by Sam Worthington (as Persus) is great! The directing by Louis Leterrier (who also directed "Unleashed" (2005), "Transporter 2" (2005) & "The Incredible Hulk" (2008) is great! The screenplay (based on Beverley Cross' screenplay) by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay & Matt Manfredi is great!<br /><br />The music by Ramin Djawadi (who also did the music to "Blade: Trinity" (2004), "Open Season" (2006), "Mr. Brooks" (2007), "Iron Man" (2008) & "The Unborn" (2009) is great!

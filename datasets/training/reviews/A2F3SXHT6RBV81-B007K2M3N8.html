But, loving music won out to my dismay, with a slight machine dysfunction, and the ending had an ironic, pleasant, totally unexpected 'beginning.'<br /><br />Now I like Richard Gere; he was my first choice to play the lead of Robert Kincaid in BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY. This movie proved that point, he definitely would have been a perfect Kincaid. His innocent sensuosity makes women blossom as, in this movie, his character (John Clark) is a late bloomer.<br /><br />In my April, 2003, review of CHICAGO, I wrote, "Richard Gere has aged well, but can he really tap dance?" In this film, he did some fancy footwork especially the Quick Step (ballroom style) which to me was the 'best dance' even though a minor calamity became a tragic consequence at the pivotal point of the Competition. The 'dirty dancing' scene was overdone but I finally found some dance moves I could do! (See my review of DIRTY DANCING: HAVANA NIGHTS)<br /><br />This story is about the humdrum, mundane life of a big city lawyer, bored with his responsible lifestyle of wealth and material things who became fascinated with a young woman who changed his existence during his mid-life crisis.<br /><br />But mainly it is a movie about dancing, all types, showing an excerpt of Cyd Charisse and Fred Astaire in SILK STOCKINGS. He'd found 'the woman of my dreams' though he had two teenagers and a busy wife at home. His life became the dance, less of family and work.<br /><br />On an impulse, he enters the life of this troubled young dance instructor who was carrying a lot of emotional baggage from a failed relationship (her former dance partner jilted her) who was hiding out, frustrated, angry at the 'deck life had dealt her.' He did something totally out of character after twenty years -- 'out of the blue'; his quiet desperation can't be quiet anymore.<br /><br />In the window, she'd looked like he felt, despondent. Every night he'd look for her from the train, and she'd be looking for him. Long ago, I too looked out my window at a young handsome FBI man as he exited work and he'd look up at me. But that's another story.<br /><br />The actress who played the stand-offish dance teacher has much experience doing modern dances but admitted on CBS Early Show that she had trouble concentrating on the ballroom dancing moves. She had a stiff back, and I learned on into the movie that dancing creates good posture along with the graceful motions involved.<br /><br />In the beginning, he fumbled trying to do the two-step (waltz) with the young woman, which reminded me of Eddy Roy at the first swing dance I attended in Knoxville. This gal seemed stiff and I thought early on that the young couple at this local dance performed much better. I was wrong. The Rumba is the dance of love, as explained with emotion by Pauline. Every move of the male dancer is to show off the female partner, as exhibited at Al Curtis' dances.<br /><br />These were a group of mismatched dancers and his beginning compatriots were a riot as they attempted to learn the moves without partners, only an older teacher who owned the dance establishment. She was a good actress, as was the full-figured blonde who wanted to be Cinderella but looked like a taller Dolly Parton. She was John's dance partner at the Competition. A truthful woman, crude but terrifying to the men, when she said, "I'm doing you a favor telling you something obnoxious about yourself." The ChaCha dancers were something else as they showed their stuff. Shades of GREASE. Stanley Tucci lost his wig but gained composure and finesse. Stanley Tucci was a closet dancer who came out of the closet in a big way.<br /><br />As with most marriages, there was miscommunication and many lies as a coverup. He admitted "I was ashamed of wanting to be happy when we have so much." Finally, everything is out on the table; I agree with him that football and dance don't agree. The working wife was sorry for her snooping, which had a positive effect on the investigator.<br /><br />Their home life could never be the same because of his 'change.' He kept going back to the dance lessons and was coaxed onto the floor at a disco by his elder dance teacher, pretending to be Yul Brunner doing "Shall We Dance" from THE KING AND I. My goodness, he was good.<br /><br />As #126 at the Dance Competition, he sparkled in the tux and some fancy dance shoes (similar to what Michael Feinstein wears in his concerts) but had to do some deep breathing practices learned in relaxation response. This life was too emotional for a practical lawyer, but he was a different person from the man who had walked into that studio in search of the elusive 'dream.' They had changed each others' lives for the better; she felt that for the first time she could be herself again. From childhood, she had held an illusion of the 'most beautiful woman in the world' who had influenced her to become a dancer.<br /><br />Dance begins with the dancer's feelings. Teaching the steps to his devoted wife, he explains that all you do is move with the music (with a little emotion involved, of course). Once I said that to someone who refused to believe. She wanted a little part of his new life, and he had his cake (ate it, too!). Like someone I asked to teach me to drink (he refused), he was afraid to hurt the person you treasure most. He resisted his impulses to love and traveled a strange journey to redemption. His son's friend was a surprise.<br /><br />You should get a kick out of the ending. He did. A rewarding movie outing well-worth the price of admission.</p></body></html>

However, that did not prepare me for the sinister nature of the film--from all sides, for the emotions and thoughts the characters' involvement evoked, or for the lingering creepy psychological impact of the perspectives presented.  Who to sympathise with?  Anyone?  I'm not sure.  Haley was equally as awful as Jeff, though I have to fully admit that at first it was captivating to observe how articulately and eloquently she put it to him.  The self-confessed irony of her character is that she is a little girl not able to do what a woman can.  My thoughts on that were that she did dispassionately what a woman would likely be too emotionally involved to do.  The terror that can be exacted by teenaged girls is no better shown that in this film.<br /><br />There were a lot of intuitive leaps on the sequence of events that did not work for me, and a few holes in Haley's logic.  In order for me to fully buy that Haley was what I was supposed to believe she was, I need to understand how she got there, and that information was missing from the film.  It was alluded to, but not established as part of the story being told.  The risk of omitting that part of the plot did not add mystique but detracted from the believability of that character.  Haley was well-acted, but it seems that her performance was poorly directed or scripted unconvincingly.  This film is certainly one to watch, a thrilled, indeed.  I can't hold it up in the ranks of chick-revenge flicks, but it is certainly now rooted in my psyche.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of Disney's & Pixar's best yet"></head><body><p>I've long been of two minds about Disney animated films -- they're often overwritten, sappy, and don't come even close to the fairy tales on which they claim to be based -- but this one is indeed very enjoyable, as shown by the Academy Award it won as best of the year. The story line is original, too: Remy is a French country boy with the makings of a great chef, but there's one big problem. He's a rat. Having found himself in Paris at the restaurant of his late hero, Chef Gusteau, Remy meets up with Linguini, the restaurant's new scullery lad, who has zero cooking talent. But by combining the rat's genius in the kitchen with the young man's human-ness (and his ability to be puppet-controlled by having his hair judiciously yanked beneath his toque), they set Paris on its ear and attract the attention of the city's greatest food critic, Anton Ego (the voice of Peter O'Toole). The characterizations are terrific, the dialogue is fun (especially Lou Romano as Linguini), and the humor is generally subtle. And, like nearly all successful "kid's films," it also has a lot for adults; my six-year-old granddaughter and I both enjoyed it.</p></body></html>

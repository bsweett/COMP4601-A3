This is the kind of movie I grew up on at Matinees. It is about time they brought it back. Fans of the Indiana Jones movies or "National Treasure" will probably like it. The outstanding cast is the best thing. Penelope Cruz was the exception, because her performance was decent, not great. They could not have picked a better group to play the parts. They are all scene stealers that can ham it up with the best of them. Well written action drama with some comedy thrown in at the right moments.<br /><br />The premise is NUMA treasure hunters have been relatively successful and former SEAL Dirk Pitt, the hansom Matthew McConaughey, has his own back story of looking for a Confederate ironclad ship lost during the Civil War. He carries a gold coin that supposedly ties in with its disappearance. The action is almost non-stop when they meet an attractive lady doctor, Penelope Cruz, from the world health organization trying to track down a deadly illness. This is a fairly well made action movie that the whole family can enjoy. The ending hints that the government would pay for future help in similar events, and thus we have an opening for a sequel. I hope they do one, and improve on it. It is a pleasure to watch and I bought a copy for it's replayability. The quality of the DVD is excellent and it has several extras.</p></body></html>

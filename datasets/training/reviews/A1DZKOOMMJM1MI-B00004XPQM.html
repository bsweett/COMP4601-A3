This was the scariest film I have ever seen. I found myself yelling at the screen and screaming in terror, and I being a horror freak who has seen much worse. THe subject of death however is one that scares me and this movie was designed to scare....I seriously do not understand how people could not enjoy this movie...it was great and one I totally recommend....this DVD is a keeper!</p></body></html>

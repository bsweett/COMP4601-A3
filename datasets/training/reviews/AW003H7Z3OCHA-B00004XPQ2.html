<meta name="summary" content="3 Fanatics + 2 Stories + 1 Ending = WWII Pacific POW epic"></head><body><p>Rated #11 on AFI's (American Film Institutes) 1998 top 100 movies of the last 100 years.  This 1957 DVD Limited Edition (7 Oscar Winner including the BIG 3; Best Picture, Director - David Lean and Actor - Alec Guinness) World War II Japanese Prisoner Of War camp Classic remains one of the best psycological war movies made.  (1953's &quot;Stalag 17&quot; a WWII German POW camp is the other.  Ironically William Holden won a Best Actor Oscar).  <p>The story is about 3 main fanatical characters; First is Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) the Japanese prison camp commander.  Second is Colonel Nicolson (Alec Guinness) the English commander of the POW's (introduced by the now famous whistling tune, &quot;Colonel Bogey's March&quot;). Third is an English (demolition expert) Commando Major (Jack Hawkins) guided by an escape POW (William Holden) a reluctant, coerced sailor who's kismet is chosen for him.  These 3 Soldiers and 1 Sailor have impossible missions to accomplish with all their fates focused at one common place at one specific time.  <p>The 2 Stories are; One build &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; in a very compressed time line.  The Second is to destroy this same bridge.  The stories have many twists and turns while the finale is surprisingly abrupt after a long complex journey.<p>This 1957 wide screen classic is beautifully restored and plays very well even without all the special digital effects of today.  The realism is so vivid.  Seen phyically on the POW's and soldiers bodies and faces.  The Dolby 5.1 puts you in the thick of the jungle with an eerie feeling.  A frighteningly close environment, dense, with very little visibility but the sound is 360 degrees.  Only these sounds to cue your imagination and senses.  <p>As always with a DVD 2 pack there is an abundance of background information about the movie.  A nice collectors package.</p></body></html>

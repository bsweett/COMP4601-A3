<meta name="summary" content="Drivel"></head><body><p>"Something's Gotta Give" is a much over hyped film that plays on the marketability of its two main stars, Jack Nicholson and Dianne Keaton.<br /><br />After watching trailers for this film, I was given the expectation of a witty, clever film.  Unfortunately, it is little of the sort.  The handful of amusing scenes or lines are in the trailer and the film itself drags slowly to a maudlin conclusion.  There are no high points.  The film simply encourages the view to keep checking to the time in the hope that a merciful end is close.<br /><br />Both Nicholson and Keaton are better actors than this film allows them to play.</p></body></html>

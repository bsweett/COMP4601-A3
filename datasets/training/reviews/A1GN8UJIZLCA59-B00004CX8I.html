<meta name="summary" content="Nicholson Flies High"></head><body><p>One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is one of only three films in history to win the Academy Awards for best picture, actor, actress and director (It Happened One Night & Silence Of The Lambs are the others). They were richly deserved as Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher and Milos Forman are all outstanding. The film is based on the Ken Kesey novel and takes place in a state mental institution. Mr. Nicholson is R.P. McMurphy who is a convict and decides it's better to spend some time in the loony bin instead of jail. Once in, he stirs the pot and locks horns with the iron-fisted Nurse Ratched played by Ms. Fietcher. The film, as the book, looks at the rigidness of the so called establishment and it's goal of making everyone, through whatever means necessary, conform to its rules. Mr. Nicholson brings a manic energy and charm to the role of R.P. McMurphy. Ms. Fletcher is menacing as the evil Nurse Ratched and Brad Dourif is superb as a mental patient. Mr. Forman paints with broad strokes and he pushes things to extremes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not Boring Just Extremely Exaggerated..."></head><body><p>There was nothing boring about this film. I heard this film's indisputable. Yet again, I was left disappointed because it failed to thrill me. No I'm not void of any sort of exaggeration so as to speak but the concept seemed cramped up. I waited for the movie to start but somehow it never does. By the time the end was around I looked at my watch facing the unavoidable feeling of being lost. Many say the fact that this movie is so difficult to understand makes it "exciting" and "re-watchable". I'm not watching this again in any case because I didn't find it worthwhile the first time around. Now This is a film a lot of people would swear by. However , it left me uninspired but ensured about the number of similar films that would prop up in the near future.<br /><br />Am I over critical? Maybe. I just choose to be so with Memento. I suggest you give this a watch to know for yourself.  There's no review that can actually help you find solid on this movie. Atleast not mine.</p></body></html>

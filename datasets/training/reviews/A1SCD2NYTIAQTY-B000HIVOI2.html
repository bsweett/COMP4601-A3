<meta name="summary" content="Great, But "Ultimate"?"></head><body><p>Straight up, I love "Stargate", and that is why I gave this a 5 star rating. I have been a big fan of the movie for ages and still consider it to be one of the best movies made ever.<br /><br />In this package, you get both the original theatrical release and the extended version of the movie. I question the use of "Ultimate" in the edition description, as the extended version adds very little to the story. In some cases, I agree with the decision to cut the scene from the theatrical release, such as the first scene of the ancient Egyptian lad running towards the huge pyramid ship. While the extras are great, they do not add all that much to the original movie.<br /><br />The Extra Features, on the other hand, are very interesting and worth a look at. I enjoyed them a lot, almost as much as the movie itself.<br /><br />"Stargate" is still one of the science-fiction greats that successfully blends history and science-fiction in one effective plot. It is a great movie with wide appeal, full of action and adventure. It is a bit predictable in some respects, but these are of small concern overall.<br /><br />This edition is very good for those who have not got a "Stargate" DVD, but for those who have already got one, it will add little to your experience of the movie.</p></body></html>

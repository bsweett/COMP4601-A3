He also runs back across his old childhood sweatheart, a duchess named Sophie played by jessica beal. However she is set to be engaged to Crown Prince Leopold, future ruler of the Austria-Hungarian Empire.  Set in a pseudo-historical setting of Vienna around the WWI times, this plays out evenly with a few twists and turns, but overall a very sound storyline.  It has Romance, suspense, and enough action to keep most guys and gals happy.  Pick this up, rent it, buy it, worth watching several times.</p></body></html>

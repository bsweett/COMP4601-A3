Bug pushes that to the extreme in detailing the popular conspiracies of the modern world. Bildebergs, Tuskegee, Tim McVeigh, Gulf War Syndrome,  AIDS etc.<br /><br />It is a psycho-drama that just gradually fades into a mental health tragedy that is more of a downer than a lesson in life. Great performances by Ashley Judd and Harry Conic Jr. can't save this depressing movie.<br /><br />1 ?*</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very Funny, but Drags a Little at the End"></head><body><p>This is a fun movie, pure and simple. Adam Sandler is his usual self and lets the other actors play off him and each other nicely. This film is loaded with WWE wrestlers, NFL players, and other people who populate ESPN & Sportscenter. The first hour or so had me laughing out loud numerous times (Chris Rock has some great lines), but it turned more serious and less fun once the final game began. After a great 3/4 of a film the final game was kind of boring. Still...this is one of the best comedies to come out this year and I'm really surprised it didn't get an R rating for quite a bit of racial humor and more than enough violence to fill five PG-13 films. ***1/2 out of *****</p></body></html>

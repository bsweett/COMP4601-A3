<meta name="summary" content="The original "Die Hard": often imitated, never surpassed"></head><body><p>It seems clear now that the 1988 film "Die Hard" is one of the most important cinematic touchstones of our lifetime, simply because every action film since then can be reduced to being a variation on the theme (e.g., "Speed" is "Die Hard" on a bus).  I am not going to claim that "Die Hard" is more than mindless entertainment, but rather that it is the standard by which all mindless entertainment is to be judged.<p>One Christmas New York City cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) flies out to Los Angeles to enjoy a nice, quiet Christmas with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who is climbing up the corporate ladder of the Nakatomi Corporation.  However John arrives at the company office party a few minutes before a group of terrorists, led by the urbane Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), takes over and holds everybody hostage.  While the bad guys begin the long process of breaking into the building' vault, McClane becomes the proverbial "fly in the ointment," on the loose in the building and causing problems.  The only person on McClane's side is Sgt. Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson), a cop on the outside who learns about what is really happening inside Nakatomi tower when McClane drops a dead body on his squad car.  Also working against McClane are top cop and complete idiot Dwayne T. Robinson (Paul Gleason) and sleazy reporter Thronburg (William Atherton).  <p>What makes "Die Hard" work?  First, the film had the virtue of making Bruce Willis a movie star.  Prior to this point he had failed to make his success with television's "Moonlighting" translate to movies.  Leading roles in "Blind Date" and "Sunset" were disappointing enough that the best part of Willis's cinematic resume was being a courtroom spectator in "The Verdict."  But in John McClane he had a character that allowed him to get off his one-liners but was also involved in some big action sequences and still found time to use his brains on several occasions.  I also like the adding insult to injury twist of fate that finds McClane barefoot when things start happening.  The result was that suddenly Willis was promoted to the A list, which almost always makes a bigger splash than when the star is there to begin with.<p>Second, there were the action sequences, the best of which remains McClane's jump off the exploding top of the building with a fire hose wrapped around his waist.  Everything else pales next to that one, but the common theme you have with all of the key sequences is that McClane is an ordinary guy facing long odds in a series of extraordinary circumstances.  Another common denominator is that for what McClane comes up with usually involves some thinking as well, such as using an office chair and a computer to create a detonator for plastique explosives.  McClane might be unlucky, but he is not stupid.  Add to this the fact that the action is pretty much non-stop once it gets started, and this is by no means a boring film.<p>Third, there are actually some emotional elements to the story, with McClane obviously worried about his wife being held by terrorists being at the top of the list.  But there is also the relationship between McClane and Sgt. Powell, even though it exists almost entirely over the radio (but has a nice double payoff in the film's denouement).  The scene where McClane asks Powell to pass along a message to Holly provides a sense of despair that usually does not enter into one of these films.<p>Ultimately, John McTiernan's film achieves a solid balance between characters and actions.  If an action film succeeds on the basis of the villain, then Rickman certainly provides that (I like the way his character is introduced), and I have always thought that VelJohnson's show "Family Matters" was an obvious and intelligent effort to capitalize on how great of a character he created in this movie.  Then there is Bedelia's Holly Gennaro McClane, who has it all, including a good right hook.  You might not understand how those two ended up together in the first place, but can sure appreciate why he wants to stay married to her.<p>Even the fact that "Die Hard 4: Die Hardest" is currently in pre-production can distract from the reputation of the original.  Actually the two sequels are better than most of the imitators that have come down the road ("Speed" is definitely the best of that bunch).  Besides making Willis a big time movie star it certainly set the bar higher for all the action films that have been made since 1988 and showed that you needed to have some heart and a sense of style to go with all the witty one-liners and explosive pyrotechnics.  "Die Hard" is still a lot of fun to watch.</p></body></html>

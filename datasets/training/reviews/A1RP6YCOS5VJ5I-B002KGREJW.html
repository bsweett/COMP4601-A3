<meta name="summary" content="A Good Movie That May Just Be A Little Overated"></head><body><p>Little Miss Sunshine is a good drama about family and how not everyone's is perfect, definitely nothing like you would see on the early days of television. This movie does have a few funny moments, but mainly focuses on the problems that families have. The dad is a perfectionist, the grandfather is a crack addict, the son refuses to speak and the uncle is a gay man who tried to commit suicide. As you can see, this movie isn't a family film, but it is  great none-the-less. The acting in the film is great, I was happy when they were and was sad when they were as well. The ending was a little disappointing, it has a climax and immediately ends without a real "what happened" after the contest that the movie is named after.</p></body></html>

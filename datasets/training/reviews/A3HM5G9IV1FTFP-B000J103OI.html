The script itself is really a very straightforward "fish out of water" story of a young aspiring journalist named Andi who takes a job at a high fashion magazine called "Runway". In order to survive and adapt, she has to learn to accommodate her ruthless boss, Editor-in-chief Miranda Priestly, and an environment full of snotty fashionistas. And, of course, along the way she learns important lessons about what she wants out of life.<br /><br />Meryl Streep, arguably the greatest film actress ever, chews up the scenery as vicious, powerful, unapologetic Miranda. One scene, in which Miranda is able to destroy a designer's spirits simply by curling her lip subtly at the sight of one of his dresses, is especially telling. However, a lot of credit also belongs to Anne Hathaway. There are few young actresses who could act alongside Meryl Streep without being blown off the screen, but she not only stands her ground but delivers a subtle, charming, comic performance as a smart, yet naive, everygirl facing her first taste of the grownup world. Streep and Hathaway save the film from mediocrity and help make it a charming, lightweight comedy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Feast Your Peepers on This One"></head><body><p>One of the best things about JEEPERS CREEPERS is the on-screen interaction between the brother and sister characters played respectively by Justin Long and Gina Philips. Like regular teenagers, they sardonically bicker, tease, and pick at each other when things start out, but when faced with a life-threatening crisis, the genuine love and respect that they have for each other shines through.  In fact, so genuine are their performances that, after watching the film, it is difficult to accept the fact that the two actors are not actually siblings.  Hopefully these excellent young performers will go on to even greater stardom as their talents mature and they fine-tune their art.<p>But the two young stars aren't the ONLY good thing about this movie.  No siree!  With JEEPERS CREEPERS, writer/director Victor Salva has pulled out nearly all the stops to craft an enjoyable old-fashioned spook-show.  Most of the action takes place in a rural setting during what appears to be early fall, and this creates a very eerie and unsettling atmosphere that harkens back to Tobe Hooper's THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE.  In fact, aficionados of the genre will no doubt notice that JEEPERS CREEPERS is replete with nods to horror greats from the cinema past, including not only Hooper's cult classic, but also such films as DRACULA, FRANKENSTEIN, PSYCHO, Spielberg's DUEL, HALLOWEEN, FRIDAY THE 13th,...and the list goes on and on.  In addition, Salva playfully and lovingly pokes fun at many horror clich&eacute;s--worn-out devices like the old dark house, the darkened tunnel, the urban legend, the barely audible warning from a dying victim, the phone call from a stranger, the warning from a psychic, and many more--yet he does so in clever and witty ways that add to the fun of the film and the logical progression of the story.<p>What would an old-fashioned monster movie be without a monster?  And does JEEPERS CREEPERS ever have one!  Somewhat reptilian in appearance and extremely cunning and intelligent, it is of the coolest, creepiest monsters to hit the cinema since 1979's ALIEN (and its sequels).  Extendable and retractable facial appendages, a mouthful of sharp teeth, big fold-out bat-like wings--all this, and it sews, carves wood, and drives, too!  And in keeping with the nostalgic undertones of the rest of the film, this monster also has characteristics that are reminiscent of nasty cinema favorites from days gone by: DRACULA, the FRANKENSTEIN monster, THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, television's GARGOYLES (1972), the aforementioned titular ghoulie from ALIEN, and more contemporary monsters like Freddy, Jason, and even HANNIBAL the Cannibal.<p>Filmgoers who enjoy the fun creep-shows of yesteryear will get a real kick out of JEEPERS CREEPERS, but it is also modern and hip enough that younger, less nostalgic genre fans should enjoy it, too.  The DVD from MGM is loaded with cool extras, not the least of which are a feature commentary from writer/director Salva, alternate openings and endings, and some interesting behind-the-scenes featurettes. This one's well worth the price of admission.</p></body></html>

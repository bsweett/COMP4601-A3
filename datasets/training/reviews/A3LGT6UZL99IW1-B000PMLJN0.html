<meta name="summary" content="Watch with the lights out - a classic style horror flick"></head><body><p>In many ways this movie resembled a horror first person video game. The surrealistic visuals  especially the exteriors), blue-lit, soft focus foggy shots, overly-dramatic score - it all adds to the atmosphere. There are plenty of hints as to the ending and big reveal. The ending was kind of a letdown. It really seems as if the writers ran out of steam and went for the obvious.  Apart from that, this is a great movie for horror films.  It relies more on atmosphere and suspense than gory effects (apart from the occasional mutilated corpse, and even those are PG.)<br /><br />Any horror fan should see it once. You really will like it.  I usually hate "doll" or "ventriloquist dummy" flicks.  But this one really stands out.</p></body></html>

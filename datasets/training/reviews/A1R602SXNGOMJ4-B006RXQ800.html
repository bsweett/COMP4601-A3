William 'Bill the Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) is the leader of the Nativist gang.  Both gangs wage a bloody war against eachother, ending in the death of Priest Vallon.  Witnessing this tragedy is Vallon's son (Leonardo DiCaprio) who  is sent to a reformatory for delinquents.  Some years later, he returns as Amsterdam to seek revenge against Bill the Butcher, his father's killer.  The worst thing about this movie were the Irish accents of Cameron Diaz and Leonardo DiCaprio.  They were bad enough to make your ears bleed.  The movie was ok but it really didn't need to be over three hours long.</p></body></html>

This is the big kahuna of mixing hitmen with high society (which is not always as pretty as it is made out to be). Yes, John Travolta and Samuel Jackson do marvelous jobs, which is especially interesting for Travolta as his early entry into being "bad" (his later entries were less convincing). Not to meantion Bruce Willis doing a smaller part that is also a bit of a departure for him -- a bad guy that wimps out but does the "right thing" (well, sorta). You get to see all sides -- cold-blooded business man, compassionate, woman-lover, deserter-turned-loyalist, sucker. The editing and sound are excellent (I also bought the soundtrack, but it includes too much dialog to be really enjoyable). I am always torn between "Pulp Fiction" and "Reservoir Dogs" for the best in the genre. They are different just enough to almost be in separate categories, but if you like mobster like films, go with "Reservoir Dogs" and if you like more dark-side-of-high-society, go with "Pulp Fiction".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Can't Hold A Candle To The Original Trilogy"></head><body><p>In terms of film trilogies, the original three "Indiana Jones" sagas are about as good as they come in terms of action, adventure, drama, and even comedy.  Unfortunately, this film goofs up the classic Indy formula and instead creates a lackluster, plodding effort that will only please those enthralled by much movement on the screen.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" sees Indy (Harrison Ford) battling a group of 1950s Russians, led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), for possession of an ancient "crystal skull" artifact that holds the key to the ancient Mayan civilization.  Along the way, Dr. Jones runs into one old friend in Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), as well as a potential child prodigy Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf).<br /><br />The #1 problem with this film is readily apparent for fans of the Indy series up to this point: In the other films, Ford's Jones was always the "straight man" in a world that seemed to be crashing in on him either due to dramatic or comedic circumstances.  He was a guy who could be counted on to get the job done and do the right thing, and viewers can identify with that.  This time, though, Ford's Jones is nothing more than a goof (the tongue-in-cheek play on Ford's age only comes off as trite, not relevant), and thus difficult to root for.  We WANT to see him be that swashbuckling hero again, but that's just not the way his character is developed this time around.<br /><br />It doesn't help that the supporting cast isn't really given enough to do.  Allen (in what could have been a grand return) is little more than a bit part, while Mutt's entire character devlopment is undermined when the film finally concludes (in a final scene that will have you rolling your eyes instead of clapping your hands).<br /><br />Director Steven Spielberg never wanted to resurrect the franchise to begin with, but enough pressure from Ford and George Lucas persuaded him to helm the project once again.  From his own mouth, Spielberg said he never intended this film to be as grand as the original trilogy, but I think that is part of the problem.  As a filmmaker, you can't just go from explosive to average...you either do a great job, or leave it creatively in the past.<br /><br />Thus, unless you are the largest of Indy fans and can overlook this film's many flaws in favor of the simple images of the whip and explorer's cap, you can skip this one.  Just remember, instead, the classic trilogy for what it was.</p></body></html>

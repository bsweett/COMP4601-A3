<meta name="summary" content="This movie is dead!"></head><body><p>I love the Romero's trilogy of the living dead, they were all well executed, I even liked very much the remake of Dawn of the dead with the faster zombies. However I really tried to take this movie seriously, but instead than scare me it made me laugh at times. This film is basically a campy b-movie with average FX and no characters charisma. Overall: FAIR</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="brilliant movie, brilliant DVD Release"></head><body><p>It's diffinately one of the best tom cruise performances I've ever seen. also not forget about jamie foxx as a cab driver. and the atmosphere of the movie, city at night. It was wonderful and it's one of the movies that I can occasionally watch several times without getting bored. let's forget about some scenario problems, but yes, I'm agree with that there were some problems! falling the first victim on the roof of the cab was not a possitive point for a professional assasin. also leaving that imoprtant bag in the cab and getting it back by killing the thievs was rather qustionable! and several same problems... but I can close my eyese to them and say that it was a brilliant movie.<br /><br />Let's have some words about DVD release too. I think they could release it as a single disc special edition DVD cause it has not that much special features for a two disc edition. but release it as a two disc special edition and with a good price & DTS audio track, tantalizing every person not only collector's to buy it! everybody knows that a two disc special edition is more exciting than a single disc even if there is not much on disc 2. thanks to the studio for a good DVD release!</p></body></html>

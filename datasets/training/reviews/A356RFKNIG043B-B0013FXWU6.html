Some might call it sweepingly epic, though the term pointlessly overblown also applies. Considering the hype, I'd call it the most overrated movie I've seen in years.<br /><br />The real dealbreaker for me was the music, which is horridly manipulative from the very start, portending doom during simple expository shots and generally calling notice to itself all the time. I love a good score, but only when it fits hand in glove with the movie. This stuff is more like foot on hand.<br /><br />Lewis is the highlight, and he is indeed excellent, making us care about a man who's not very worthy of much love. Upton Sinclair's story is somewhat overdone here, though; despite some fine moments, I just stopped caring about what happened to whom about 90 minutes in, and knowing we were in for another 70 minutes was somewhat sigh-inducing.<br /><br />Which is too bad, as this film would have wowed me if cut to about 100 minutes, or at most two hours. But maybe that's just me. I'd heard so much for so long that I expected too much and got much less than hoped for. Excepting Lewis, always a treat to watch.<br /><br />Nonetheless, there is no way I'd want to see this again for a year or three, even for a barrel of oil.</p></body></html>

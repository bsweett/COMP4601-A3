<meta name="summary" content="Thank YEW for making up for 'The Motion Picture'..."></head><body><p>As a long time Trek fan, I nearly fainted when I heard they were coming out with 'Star Trek The Motion Picture'.  But my excitement quickly faded when I saw what they had done to my favorite TV series.  C'Mon!  After all those years, THIS is the BEST they could come up with???  Well I almost skipped 'The Wrath of Kahn' altogether, but boy was I glad I went to see it opening night!  This started the whole craze of 'Only the even numbered Trek films are good'.  <p>What a GREAT idea to take a snippet from an earlier original episode and I believe they chose very well when they made 'Space Seed' the one they went with.  I have to admit, Ricardo has held up well over the years, and his acting and madness is well portrayed as Kahn.  From the best special effects (I believe) in the Trek films (yes, even the newer ones aren't any better) to a slam-bam plot that moves at warp speed, 'Kahn' is arguably the best of the Trek movies.  Despite the death of Spock, which is dealt with in Trek III (so so in the Trek world of theatrical movies) my ONLY gripe with this movie (and see if you don't agree) is in the final moments before the Genesis Device goes off in the Nebula, the ONLY thing I wish HAD happened that DIDN'T was Kahn died believing that the explosion would at least kill Kirk...wouldn't it have been great to see Kahn's reaction when the Enterprise goes to warp JUST BEFORE the device detonated? Aside from that minor complaint, this is definitely one of the all-time great Sci-Fi movies and like I said, arguably the best Trek film-to-date (with Trek VI coming in a close 2nd).  <p>Rush out and grab this on DVD, although as one other reviewer mentioned, it did NOT have the added bonus footage that was shown on ABC back in the 80's (I kinda expect this sorta stuff in the DVD editions...) and that left me wanting a bit, but other than that, a well made film and well directed by Nicholas Myer (who also was at the helm of 'The Undiscovered Country'). Trek fans rejoice, this is about as good as it gets.</p></body></html>

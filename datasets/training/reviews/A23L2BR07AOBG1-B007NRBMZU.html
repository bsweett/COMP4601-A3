<meta name="summary" content="This is a bad movie with an excellent trailer"></head><body><p>Why is the trailer excellent?  It decieves you into thinking that certain events happen out of order and at least that mislead has brought some attention to the film because otherwise this fish is dead in the water.  The biggest reason that I can point to the directing.  It's absolutely terrible.  I never had a sense of place within this film whether it was outside, inside, obviously on a set.  These places didn't feel like anything.  The film doesn't establish moods, or opinions about much of anything and that is the fault of the director. I didn't sense any kind of importance, or relevance to the events that happened within the first five minutes and within ten I was passively wishing this was over.  The editing was cold and mechanical when the only way that this would've worked would've been as a personal study (it doesn't the script, or brains to put off a competent sci fi, I'll get to that later).  Sound is the only thing the directors did partially well.  I say partially because when the actors couldn't keep attention on the screen the sound jumped out and got it, but after awhile it became revealed as a cheap trick to simply replace emotional development. What's worse is that in some scenes which are meant to be disturbing, they have surround sound of a crowd laughing and it's so loud that it actually sounds like the crowd in the theater is laughing at the film, just plain bad.  As for the acting, I think that the direction does the performances a disservice, but the casting director is just as much to blame for some obvious miscasts, or maybe they wouldn't be miscasts if the script gave them something interesting to say, or if it was plausible and the actors were being directed by good artists.  There are some whole within the plot and I'm sure that they're intentional.  1) If his father had this power to travel back in time than why is it that the blackouts that Kutcher's character indures within his life are only his own tamperings later in life. 2)If he simply goes back by concentrating on the events that happened in his journals which are actually his memories then why can't he go back by simply remembering?  3)what seven year old boy keeps a journal in today's day and age? 4)If he wrote all of these old journals for such a long time, why is it that he never reads them until after the blackouts stop? 5)If he can go back through time and change events, therefore changing history and his memories then it's not possible that he could save those memories of himself changing, or that they had been changed at all.  He might even forget about his ability to change things, otherwise, it doesn't make sense for his brain to be bleeding. 6)The quote at the beginning suggests that the butterfly effect can be catstrophic and because its effects are limited to the lives of only a few people and not the surroundings and/or entire world it really doesn't fulfill its potential. Ditto on the movie, but Kutcher was a passable actor in the main role. Also, the movie is an empty nuggett because it goes out of its way at the end to say that certain talents are better left unused, if that's the lesson then why waste my time showing them being used haphazardly and only having them work out at the end in service of the plot? On the plus side, I didn't hate it and just felt empty at the end, in a sedated way.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Is Travis Bickle a post-Vietnam Holden Caulfield?"></head><body><p>Travis Bickle - the "Taxi Driver" in the film - is not so much a psychopath but someone who is mentally ill. He struggles to relate and connect with other people, slowly becomes detached from reality, indulges in inappropriate behaviour, and has a naive sense of what is right and wrong.<br /><br />The loneliness and disconnection of Bickle has echoes in the character of Holden Caulfield in "The Catcher in the Rye" who likewise drifts around New York City searching for some kind of meaning.<br /><br />The ending always seemed a little strange until one accepts it as a fantasy of Bickles deranged mind.<br /><br />"Taxi Driver" remains a powerful and disturbing film even after all these years despite far more graphic films because the characters are so believable.<br /><br />A great film from the great Martin Scorsese.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Could Have Been More"></head><body><p>"Constantine" is a movie with one cool premise, and some serious potential. Sadly, I thought much of it was wasted and lost in the final product. While this does not make the movie bad, it certainly left me feeling that it could have offered more.<br /><br />Basically, the story follows Constantine, a coughing, hacking and wheezing demon hunter, (he smokes too much), who is caught up in the cosmic battle between God and Satan when the delicate balance of power is upset. The shadowy agreement, which included no direct influence on humans, gets shattered and Constantine gets caught up in the whole thing.<br /><br />The acting is pretty much the same as anything you would expect from Keannu Reeves, and most of the acting was of the same or similar quality. Peter Stormare's portrayal of Satan was particularly laughable.<br /><br />The somewhat corny ending really did not suit the overall darkness of the movie and seemed to try and salvage something of a feel-good, "good triumphs over evil" message. I will not mention that ending for those who have not seen it.<br /><br />"Constantine" was an average movie, but as I said, it could have been so much better. The special effects were excellent and the visual feast was awesome. Beyond that, it barely poked above average. Not something I would consider adding to the collection, but sure worth a few bucks in hiring it.</p></body></html>

I must admit is was skeptical of the film, but that was quickly dismissed by Burton't genius. The towns' people are very much how I would image them, and the story takes on a more mystical side that Irving gave it. One could almost say it is better than the original story. It is certainly more interesting.<p>DVD is great so is the movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="'The Illusionist' Conjures Delightful Magic"></head><body><p>`The Illusionist' provides great, old-fashioned fun.  Much like `The Prestige,' it is a magician's movie that requires the audience to keep their eyes on the subject.  This time the titled `illusionist,' Eisenheim (Edward Norton) is at the top of his form, but instead of wanting fame and fortune like the magicians in `The Prestige,' he keeps his eyes on the duchess, the love interest of the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell).  At one point his fame gets him invited to an affair held by the Crown Prince, himself, and Eisenheim provides a trick to pull up the Prince's sword, much like the child with the pure heart does in the medieval fable.  He succeeds, but not without some doubts.  His embarrassment at this awkward moment creates a rivalry with `the illusionist'.  Supported by the chief inspector (Paul Giamatti), Eisenheim has just enough time to conjure a brazen love affair with the duchess.  But a drunken confrontation between the Prince and his unfaithful fianc&eacute; provides tragedy, one that seems to only be answered by a different venue on the illusionist's stage.  The Prince's jealous rage has him figuratively putting a noose around Eisenheim, one from which he must escape.<br /><br />While `The Prestige' benefits from Christopher Nolan's modern direction with a progressively dark appeal, `The Illusionist' has time-honored filmmaking with appeal that delivers its magic with greater resolution (from director, Neil Burger).  Both movies are excellent and are edited with precision, but while `The Prestige' is masterful at development; `The Illusionist' wins in a matchup.</p></body></html>

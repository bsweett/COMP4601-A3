<meta name="summary" content="till death do us part"></head><body><p>tim burton is one of my fav directors, i have loved his work since nightmare before christmas and once again he delivers with corpse bride. a witty, dark, and very nicley done stop motion film. the film is set in 19th century england were victor van dort and victoria everglot are due to be married though they never before met. see, the van dorts are rich but have no social class. the everglots have social class but are broke. so what do you do to make sure each family gets what they want? marry of there kids and get the stuff they dont have. victor is incredibly nervous and after a horrible wedding rehersal victor heads of to gather himself but in a turn of events he finds himself married to the corpse bride, a blue faced woman who's husband left her. now he has to go through the land of the dead and get back to victoria. a imaginitve, often funny, and visually good film it quickly lights its way in a brisk 77 minutes, just long enought to not wear out its welcome. very excellent, definent for nightmare before christmas fans.</p></body></html>

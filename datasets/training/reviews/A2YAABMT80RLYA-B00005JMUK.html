<meta name="summary" content="The best movie, and best performance, of 2003."></head><body><p>"Monster" is easily one of the most gripping movies to come along in years, owing to both the potent subject matter and the stellar performances by the two female leads. It is a sad, brutal story about the unfortunate lives of two women who find solace in each other, and their struggle for survival leads to a murder spree that produced America's first female serial killer. <p>Based on the true account of Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron), her sad story will grip you from the beginning. She was a prostitute from the age of 13, and has led the hardest of lives. She has never known love, affection, and has lived on a wing and a prayer. The real life Wuornos claimed to have slept with over 250,000 men in her lifetime. One night, she meets a young kindred spirit named Selby (Christina Ricci). She lives under slightly better circumstances, but still feels detached from the rest of society, being a lesbian in a strictly religious family. What blossoms is a love story between these two girls. Wuornos is not a lesbian per-se, but she is smitten with Selby, who is the first person to love her for who she really is, and not treat her like trash and cast her aside. One fateful encounter with a vicious john and potential killer turns the tide. Wuornos kills a john who has beat and raped her, and if given the chance, would have killed her. This starts her down a pit with greasy sides, and she takes to the streets and kills as many johns who will pick her up. Her motives are both money and survival, for her and Selby, who is na?ve and squeamish but willing to play along. Her initial killing was justifiable, and the audience will empathize with her for it, but the murders that ensue become more and more senseless. <p>"Monster" is not a morality tale, nor does it condone or condemn the crimes Wuornos commits. It tells the story of one life that started in the gutter and never quite crawled out. Wuornos is a character who is both physically and personally unattractive, drunk and mouthy throughout most of the movie, but you cannot help but feel sadness for her, though you don't forgive her for the crimes she commits. The Selby character is the Yin to the Yang in this case. She is much younger than Wuornos, and while open about her homosexuality, she is still confused and somewhat disillusioned about the world around her. She is in it for the love and security, while Wuornos is surprised that she can love at all after the life she's lived.<p>There has been much buzz about Charlize Theron's powerhouse performance, so much that it has overshadowed every other aspect of the movie. The hype, however, is very much deserved. Theron doesn't just play the part, she becomes it. She plays with honesty and conviction that we rarely see in performances nowadays. Even more shocking is how she has transformed for the role. The makeup effects aside (which add 10 years to her life), she gained 30 pounds for the role, and her physical appearances suggest countless rapes, beatings, and the ravages of hard living and consumption. The transformation has to be seen to be believed. Christina Ricci has only gotten better with age, and while this role is more subdued than her best (The Opposite of Sex leaps to mind), she is fantastic as always. <p>What I respect most about "Monster" is that it is not overly dramatic in trying to humanize some pretty nasty characters, nor does it pander to the typical Hollywood clich&eacute;s. Having said that, it is also doesn't pull any punches. The violence and rape scenes will leave scars on more sensitive viewers, but even the most dismissive viewers cannot deny the impact of this movie, and the performance of Theron will stand as one of the best female lead roles in recent years.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent comic book adventure movie, better than the 1st"></head><body><p>I found the story, character development to be much improved over the first Hellboy. All the characters were really great in their roles and the love interest subplot was cool. Most movies just rely on effects and less on story, but this movie has both, great monsters,effects and a great story. Another good comic book hero story makes it big time on the screen. The DVD Collectors Set comes with the Golden Army robot and booklet, DVD and is worth every penny. I think if you like super hero movies in general this shouldn't disappoint. I thought it was better than the Spiderman movies and as good as any of the Xmen movies. I liked it better than Dark Knight as well. This is one action adventure hero movie with substance.</p></body></html>

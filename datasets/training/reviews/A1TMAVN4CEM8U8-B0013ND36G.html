<meta name="summary" content="What's sexy?"></head><body><p>Terminator 3  DVD<br /><br />  In Terminator 3 (T3) the cyborg is a newer model, a TX, I believe and she's not after John Connor as the primary target, but his "to-be-wife, Catherine Brewster.  This movie has a lot of great lines, such as"<br /><br />-What is sexy( not really a line ,but on a billboard)<br />-I like your car<br />-I like your gun<br />-I lied<br />-You are terminated<br />-she'll be back,<br />-I'm back<br /><br />I really enjoyed the use of music to intensify each perilous moment in the movie.<br /><br />Hollywood sure loves chase scenes and gasoline fires.  Ther's a ton of each in this.<br /><br />BTW, what is it with Arnold and the sunlasses?<br /><br />Have you noticed how we/Hollywood anthromorphize the robots so that they have two eyes in their head?  Why not more eyes.?<br /><br />Anyhow this movie begs at least two thing:<br /><br />1) a fourth movie ( well, FOX  is coming out with a TV series so maybe that's the plan.<br />2) A trilogy or quadrilogy set of DVD's like Alien<br /><br />Highly recommended for Terminator fans, Arnold fans and fans of Science Fiction movies.<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2007</p></body></html>

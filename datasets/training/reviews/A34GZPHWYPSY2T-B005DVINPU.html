For those who don't: Burton was a modest, small-fry director and Warner Brothers approaches him with what was to be the biggest action-superhero movie of all time. Remember the year. Burton didn't know if he was doing the right thing half the time, yet look at the result!<br /><br />Sure, the dialogue is stupidly performed. So what? Half of Cary Grant's films are like that. The storyline is solid, the look is all Frank Miller, although Bob Kane was directly hands-on with this film, and he did not like Miller at all. Not a shock: Kane invented the Miller style, only to be told it was too much for readers back then. So make no mistake: Burton married his nightmares to Kane's genius vision.<br /><br />I want to make an aside about the soundtrack, composed and much performed by Danny Elfman (when it wasn't the big orchestra). I never get to write a thing about Elfman, and I'm a HUGE fan since his Mystic Knights of the Oingo-Boingo days. What a tour-de-force he achieved here. He'd never hit this level again, though he's still second only to John Williams.<br /><br />Choosing Nicholson as the Joker was probably a bad move, but that is what Burton wanted. In a way, he fits really well. Compare him to Heath Ledger and decide. The biggest whack on the chin was selecting Michael Keaton to play the Dark Knight. Burton got death threats for that. In his own words, he did not want a "square-jawed, Arnold Schwarzenegger-type."<br /><br />One star was lost because I hate Kim Basinger. She can't act. Sorry.<br /><br />Other than this movie being in so many ways far ahead of its time, I think the casting of Keaton deserves additional comment. For those who were not there on premiere day, as I was, there were people in the theater dressed in Batman costumes. This was due to Keaton. His performance was hailed by all critics, even though part of the public hated the choice. Everyone was saying, "MR. MOM as Batman?!"<br /><br />What is unfair is that Keaton set the standard for the portrayal of Batman and Bruce Wayne. He's been copied faithfully ever since he did this, and Keaton himself seems to have lost his entire career after walking away from the 2nd sequel. Today we tend to forget him and his work here.<br /><br />I recall talking with my martial arts colleagues about it. We said, well, we know masters and great fighters who are puny-looking and weak-chinned, just like Keaton. We knew Keaton had tremendous potential: indeed, the Batman performances post-Keaton are pale imitations of him. Burton selected Keaton because of his mad eyes and expressive brow--someone to square off against the equally mad Nicholson. And it worked. Try to imagine someone else doing that...oh, wait, let's see, Val Kilmer did it, George Clooney (who played Batman as gay), Christian Bale and I am waiting to see if they break out some pimply-faced 16-year-old for the next installment.<br /><br />CRAP ALARM!!--no one holds a candle to this golden original, and there's no one like Keaton to play Batman. I've heard rumors for years that Keaton will play him again, but I think those rumors were about the Bale film and not about Keaton. Still, I wonder if he'd do it again, just to make us all happy again. BATMAN made me happy. I loved that a good guy, albeit it a billionaire, was doing truly good things. I loved that he dressed up just to scare the pants of the criminals. I like the fact that he saved rather than killed them, as Kane originally had him doing in the first comic adventure.<br /><br />I love that Burton and not some other screw-head directed this, and I love Elfman's rousing score (the overture has been compared to Beethoven, so listen up for it). And I love that the 1980s went out with this summer blockbusting BANG!!<br /><br />For all that, this is not only one of my favorite Deeply Personals, it is a ground-breaking film that has, as you all readily know, absolutely NO peer.</p></body></html>

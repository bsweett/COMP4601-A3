<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful Musical with Terrific Dancing -- a Trifle Dated"></head><body><p>&quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; is the definitive Hollywood musical, and charms and delights our 21st century audiences despite the (very few) characteristics of the genre that don't hold up quite so well.  <p>There are so many high points to this movie -- the amazing cast, the songs, the choreography, and, most surprisingly, the satirical send-up of Hollywood and the &quot;star system.&quot;  <p>The plot is well-known.  Silent film star couple, Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly, who also co-directed with Stanley Donen) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are America's sweethearts.  At a Hollywood premiere of their latest romance, breathless fans ignore sidekick Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor, in perhaps the best sidekick performance in film history) and scream in delight as Lockwood and Lamont pander to their adoration.  Nobody, however, seems to notice that the gorgeous Lamont never speaks . . . <p>Her imposed silence Lamont has a voice that recalls a cat with its tail caught in a wringer, although Lamont is such a &quot;dumb blonde&quot; (bless Hagen -- nobody ever played this stereotype better!) that she is blissfully unaware of her screech.  No matter, 'cause it's the silent film era, right?  Wrong!  Progress brings in &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; and the era of &quot;talkies.&quot;  No longer will clever staging of press events suffice.<p>Soon, Don Lockwood is staring career meltdown in the face as the first Lockwood-Lamont &quot;talkie&quot; sends the audience into hysterics.  Not only is Lamont's screech audibly offensive, they can't keep the sound synchronized to the film, and the sound editing even when in synch is as amateurish as a high-school film production.<p>What to do?  Fortunately, Lockwood had fallen for young, beautiful Kathy Selden (a teenage Debbie Reynolds), a starlet in the making.  Cosmo comes up with the idea of dubbing Selden's voice for Lamont's, and all is fixed . . . or not.  Lamont, an imbecile but smart enough to know her value, insists on ruining Selden's career to preserve her own . . . and so on and so forth.<p>The plot, ingenious as it is, is really secondary.  The main delight in this movie is the amazing dancin' and singin' that the performers offer up.  While most of it is pretty silly, campy stuff (particularly the Kelly-O'Connor set pieces), they simply dazzle.  Kelly is the most robust, athletic dancer of his generation, and O'Connor, well, the man doesn't have a bone in his body.  While the movie's most famous scene comes from Kelly splashing in puddles during the title track, the most amazing dance number has to be O'Connor's comic flailings in &quot;Make 'Em Laugh,&quot; where he runs up walls, flirts with a mannequin, and generally pulls out all stops.<p>Debbie Reynolds does a magnificent job keeping up with these two giants, and is generally a pleasure to watch, even though she's clearly outclassed as a hoofer.<p>While some great old films seem to get better with age (think &quot;Casablanca,&quot; &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; and &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;), &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; is an American classic that does not hold up quite so well in some minor respects.  For example, when breaking into choreographed step, Kelly, O'Connor, and Reynolds sometimes appear too rigid, with smiles frozen on their faces, which is incongruous to those raised on more modern musicals like &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; where the dancers take a more naturalistic, emotional approach to their dancing. The dancing in &quot;Singin'&quot; holds up, but the performers were constrained by the expectations of their audiences, which somehow demanded that the performers &quot;look pleasant&quot; while dancing.  <p>Still, &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; remains one of the best tonics to a foul mood ever . . . I defy you to watch this movie and not feel a smile creeping over your face.</p></body></html>

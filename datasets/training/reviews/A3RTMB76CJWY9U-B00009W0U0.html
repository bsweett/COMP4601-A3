Scary clown? Check. Stupid teens w/ broken-down car? Check. It's hard to say whether certain decisions were "homage" or just plain copying (the psychotic, rural-redneck family straight out of Texas Chainsaw's many sequels, and the creepy babydoll-wearing matron pulled from Baby Jane) but taken together it's a mess of a movie. All of them, by themselves, interesting to disturbing images, perhaps... but the entire experience is haphazard and disjointed, and missing out on some crucial elements.<br /><br />Among the elements its missing are a central conflict between protagonist and antagonist. The stupid teens that stumble their way into the charnel-house never have any particular hope or ambition of getting out of things alive, and once they're caught, they're caught. For a conflict to work, whatever passes for the "hero" must have some semblance of plan or at least a fighting chance; here, we just watch to see how their deaths will pan out. There's no conflict in this film because nothing is standing in the way of the murderers' designs. It's all easy pickin's.<br /><br />The plot is ramshackle. Officers are thrown into the film and then summarily dispatched, having caused nothing more than a few more minutes to tick off the clock. It's as though Zombie decided, well, in this kind of horror film there are always a couple of local cops that get offed. And so, there must be some here, too! The murderers dine with their teen-victims, fix their car, let them go... and... then assault them.<br /><br />Why let them go (let alone fix their car), if the overall plan was murder? Sure, we could invent a reason, like "they wanted to play with their minds," but I think the actual reason is probably that Zombie envisioned a scene where scarecrows would "come to life" and attack. And so, he twisted the plot out of shape to realize that vision.<br /><br />This is not a good movie. It's not particularly scary, and fails at nearly every level of what we would call "drama." The only justification for the events in this film seems to be that Zombie wanted those events to happen so that he could film them. They serve no other purpose -- advancing plot, characterizing, developing theme -- that a person might look for in a story. Visually, which is where this particular movie lives or dies, I would say that it's over-produced. The movie just doesn't warrant the many "tricks" (cuts to grainy footage, negative prints, etc.) that are employed, and usually to no great effect or purpose. But there is a certain amount of command in the direction, and if the director had an actual script to work with, who knows but it might not have sucked.<br /><br />I'll give it a second star for some decent visual work, and the fact that many of the films this one hearkens to are some personal favorites of mine. That said, it never nears their quality, and fails on many basic, fundamental levels.</p></body></html>

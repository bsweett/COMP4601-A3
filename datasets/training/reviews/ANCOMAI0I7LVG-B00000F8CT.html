<meta name="summary" content="In all probability, the greatest horror film of all time..."></head><body><p>`Alien' knows how to scare you.  It crawls beneath the surface of your skin and festers, irritating your flesh until you can't take the itch anymore.  It sends shivers down your spine and makes your hair stand on end and whispers the sweet nothings of despair in your ears.  `Alien' understands the human psyche and it exposes it to raw unadulterated fear.<br /><br />As you can probably ascertain; I am in love with this movie.<br /><br />I have seen `Alien' a handful of times and each and every time I am brought to that same secluded place of pure paranoia.  The setting is prime for that feeling of solidarity; the brilliant tagline (`In space no one can hear you scream') says it all.  What makes the film all the more effective is Ridley Scott's masterful pace and direction.  The film may seem slow to many, as if it doesn't want to get started, but that pace is what helps build the tension inside the core of the viewer.<br /><br />Ridley Scott is, in my humble opinion, the finest director working today.  He has a way of understanding the genre in which he is working and mastering it in order to deliver a piece of perfection to the viewer.  No matter what genre he is attempting he does so with effortless precision.<br /><br />How many other directors can claim to have delivered a masterful war film, gangster film, cross country drama, swords-and-sandals epic, sci-fi horror film and so on?<br /><br />In `Alien' Scott beautifully crafts a feeling of dread and terror that stands up even today as one of the purest and most effective horror films of all time.  `Alien' serves as a benchmark for many horror films that follow, so many of them depending on influence from this film to even make a dent in the viewers mind.  `Alien' will always be remembered as one of the scariest films of all time.<br /><br />Another facet of this film that excels is that superb acting by everyone involved.  Who would have ever thought that this film would be Sigourney Weaver's big breakout role but in all actuality it proved to be one of the greatest female performances of all time.  Weaver has never been this magnificent (although there is no denying she has turned out brilliance after brilliance).  Weaver is not the only gem here though.  The entire cast is flawless.  Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Yaphet Kotto; everyone is on point and compliments one another beautifully.<br /><br />The ship itself is probably the greatest performer in the film though.  It breathes a life all its own; one of terror and misery.  The art direction and set designs are flawless and evoke in the audience a genuine fear.  The mood is marvelously set just by glancing at the creaky ship.<br /><br />As the fated crew answers the supposed `distress call' we cringe because we know what's going to happen to them.  As they are hunted and slaughtered one by one we tense up because we know it's only the beginning.  And then there is the infamous tension building `chestburster' scene that will haunt your dreams and build your nightmares for a long time to come.  We become one with this movie as it cements itself into our minds and slowly, yet effectively, spreads through our souls until we feel nothing except what is purposed for us.  `Alien' is uncanny; a brilliant and flawless example of what cinema is all about.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Thank you very much"></head><body><p>For some reason, I wasn't really looking forward to this film. Considering it's all I've heard for the past couple of months, I was wondering if it would live up to the hype of one person. And since I had no choice, cos they wouldn't watch it alone - they were too scared - I watched it.<p>What surprised me, was for an 'Elvis' film, there were no Elvis songs played and when Elvis turns on the TV and sees the Elvis Presley Movie Marathon, none of the clips are from any of Elvis's movies (I should know, my mum has most of them). For both, the licensing costs would have been too much for the budget, so they showed stock footage. I was disappointed at there being no Elvis songs, but the theme used throughout the film more than makes up for that! That theme is absolutely fantastic, sad and lonely, but also happy at the same time.<p>I wasn't sure about Bruce Campbell as Elvis. I've always seen movies with Kurt Russell, and he did a fine job. I've only seen Brucie in two Evil Dead movies - and managed to fall asleep during the second one - so I wasn't sure what to expect. Although, he is a nice looking guy, and reminds me very much of Jim Carrey in those movies. Plus, he was playing the older, fat Elvis, not the young and cute Elvis. For a guy who's now in his forties, he's no longer young and cute, but by the looks of it, it wasn't all him that was Elvis. There must have been a LOT of padding in there, especially that 9-months pregnant stomach. And Brucie had the voice down pat, and even some of the little moves - although none of the hip swivelling unfortunately! So I was fair away with him as Elvis.<p>Ossie Davis provided some light entertainment as John F. &quot;Jack&quot; Kennedy, who would only answer to Mr. Kennedy most of the time. (And in a very cheap joke, he was &quot;dyed&quot; black) He was hilarious, as he tried to accuse 'Elvis' of knowing Harvey Lee Oswald who 'tried' to kill him. And in his little electric chair he's so funny!<p>This is a terrific movie, despite the lack of Elvis songs. It also makes you think about the whole myth that Elvis is still alive - but not flipping burgers! I loved that whole aspect of the movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a belated review...sorry, I was stuck on an island"></head><body><p>A few weeks ago I went and saw the Island, which stars Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor and is directed by Michael Bay.  It's a movie which examines cloning as a practice to make spare body parts for humans.<br /><br />Not so good, not so bad.<br /><br />There is a thoughtful set-up for the movie.  A lot of big and little details are handled well, and in detail.  There was an attempt here to make more than just an action movie.<br /><br />The two main actors do well with the material they're handed.<br /><br />The plot is a little predictable: figure out the setup, grab the girl and escape, and then run-run-run while trying to get a better handle on the situation.<br /><br />However, it's a Michael Bay movie.  There's his typical directing style, which he brings as baggage to every movie he directs.  Which means...he's got a terrific eye for cinematography and colour, and you could stop any scene at any time, and remark to yourself that it looks great, even artistic.  Let the film, run, though, and it's choppy action, running from scene to scene without a pause for thought.  It's like a music video--made for those who have very little in the way of attention spans.<br /><br />We must be getting a little tired of this type of directing style, non?<br /><br />This is about equal to the other big summer dud, for me at least: War of the Worlds.</p></body></html>

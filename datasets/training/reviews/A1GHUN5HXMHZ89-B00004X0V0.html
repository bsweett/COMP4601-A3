Quite honestly one of the best SciFi movies in recent years. Original story adds to the fun. Most people knew that the Air Force conducted investigation Blue Book and sent around men in black suits to ask questions about UFOs. Now we see what is a movie poking fun at what that could have led to. Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, and Rip Torn are a great combo in this bug hunting techno comedy. Has a good deal of replayability so it is well worth having on DVD.</p></body></html>

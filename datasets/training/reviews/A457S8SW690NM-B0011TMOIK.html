<meta name="summary" content="The best Harry Potter movie"></head><body><p>Once again, there's no point for me to tell the plot of this because everyone knows it but I just want to get my point accross. While this book was my least favorite of the first 3, somehow, this movie was brilliant. I was sucked in from the start when I saw Dobby. Dooby was brilliantly created and is like a cute version of the evil Golem. Dobby was wonderfully brought to life. Once again, the movie had great acting, not by Daniel Radcliffe especially but by the wonderful Alan Rickman. But, I'm sure kids reading this review have no idea who he is.<br /><br />This movie is simply an excellent family movie. It's great fun and turns a solid but average book somehow into an excellent family movie. So, enjoy yourselves kids, because this is going to be the best Harry Potter movie of the franchise, period. How do I know? I don't but the rest of the books are too long to put into a movie that isn't boring. Chris Columbus directed two good movies, this one much better than the first, but I'm sorry, now that he's not the director, I think that this franchise is going to take a turn for the worst. Especially after seeing the third movie. Yikes!</p></body></html>

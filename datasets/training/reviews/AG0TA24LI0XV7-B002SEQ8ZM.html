If you or your kiddies don't want to be frightened or disturbed or enchanted, avoid "Coraline" at all costs! Let's just get that out of the way and move on.<br />Now, for those of you who thrive on dark and delightfully creepy fantasy, this movie is right up your alley.]<br /><br />First of all, I fell in love with this story as soon as I plunged into the book by the wonderful British storyteller Neil Gaiman, who is cemented as an icon in the world of fantasy. I am an ardent fan of children's fantasy tales, horror, and all things British... so, I was charmed to the hilt with this dark and wondrous tale. And now there is a fanastic movie to enjoy.<br /><br />This stop-motion movie does the book justice, totally. The character designs, sets, lighting, cinematography, lovely musical score-- everything is very nicely done. You can tell that a lot of work went into this movie. There is plenty here to entertain everyone, and enough peril and danger and scary stuff to satisfy folks like myself who enjoy a good villain and some macabre trappings. Maybe you have to be a fan of all things creepy to appreciate "Coraline". I just happen to love scary films, fiction, and ideas.<br /><br />The character voices are terrific. Teri Hatcher is very effective as the Other Mother and the real mother. Dakota Fanning, Ian McShane, Dawn French, and Jennifer Saunders all contribute quite nicely.<br /><br />If you (or your family) have a penchant for fantasy or horror, this is for you. (And if you're into animation, all the better.) It smacks of the best Roald Dahl tales, of Alice's wild adventures in Wonderland, and of classic horror movies I grew up loving.<br /><br />Henry Selick does a top notch job directing this movie, which pulls you in quickly and takes you on a spooky and colorful ride. Certain things will stand out for you, as they did for me: the opening credits sequence which shows scenes of the Other Mother creating the doll... the enchanting and gorgeous garden in the Other World... the audience of black Scottish Terriers watching Ms. Spink and Ms. Forcible's show... and the emotional core of the story, too.<br /><br />Part of the pleasure for someone who has read the book is seeing these scenarios that were previously only within one's imagination; now they come to life on screen almost magically, and it's the next best thing to revisiting the book.<br /><br />I didn't mind that the setting was changed from England to America; I guess Hollywood still thinks we can't handle that so much. No big thing. I thought the addition of the Wyborn character actually worked well in the story; In the book, Coraline talks to herself a great deal, and I suppose that does not work well on film, so they added a character to help with exposition and to help Coraline in her quest.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is a winner.</p></body></html>

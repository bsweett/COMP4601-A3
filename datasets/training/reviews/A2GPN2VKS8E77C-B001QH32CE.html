<meta name="summary" content=""Baby, Don't You Cry." Tender Romance Movie That Will Make You Love Pie."></head><body><p>Writer-director-star-songwriter Adrienne Shelly's final movie is a bittersweet romance film that will make you fall in love with Keri Russell (if you haven't already) and pie. There's not a false note in this sensuous (figuratively speaking) drama of a young waitress named Jenna (Keri Russell; TV's "Felicity") who is trapped in an abusive relationship with her loser s.o.b. husband Earl (Jeremy Sisto; the abysmal and blasphemous made-for-TV film "Jesus"). I won't give the plot away, though. Watch for Andy Griffith (TV's "The Andy Griffith Show" and<br />"Matlock") as the cantankerous, but warm-hearted, owner of Joe's Pie Shop. Sadly, Adrienne Shelly (who also plays Dawn in the film, besides co-writing the heart-warming song "Baby, Don't You Cry" & writing and directing and the movie) was murdered before the film was released (her killer is currently in jail), leaving behind a grieving husband and a cute little girl (who appears briefly in the film). Rated PG for some language.</p></body></html>

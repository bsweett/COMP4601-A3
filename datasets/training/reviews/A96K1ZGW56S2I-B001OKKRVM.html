<meta name="summary" content="A Story of Love and Survival"></head><body><p>There used to be a time when at least one nature documentary was released on a massive national scale about every other year. Disney used to be the major Hollywood producer and distributer of these films because they were so family friendly, but there were other studios and independent agencies involved, too. Around the late 1970s, these movies virtually stopped being released. Perhaps it was because of STAR WARS (that film changed everything else in the business, why not nature documentaries, too?). Perhaps it was because people just didn't care about animals anymore. Whatever the reasons, major nature documentaries released on a large scale haven't been seen in most theatres around the country for a long time.<br /><br />Until the summer of 2005. That's when MARCH OF THE PENGUINS became the little picture that could and went on to become the highest-grossing documentary of all time (FAHRENHEIT 9/11 really isn't a documentary).<br /><br />MARCH OF THE PENGUINS illustrates a nine-month cycle in the life of Emperor Penguins. Each year these birds trek to the same breeding grounds in Antartica, battling sub-zero temperatures, bone-chilling winds, and ferocious predators all in the name of love and survival. The Emperor Penguin mating rites are one of love because these penguins remain monogamous to their spouses throughout the mating season, they only separate after it's time to leave their little ones behind.<br /><br />MARCH OF THE PENGUINS is a beautifully filmed picture. It not only captures the beauty of nature, but illustrates its wrath as well. Baby penguins are born, but in the process old penguins die and others are eaten by sea lions. It's a difficult lesson for children to grasp, but it is presented so well in the movie that it teaches children about the survival of a species, but without worrying them unduly.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman narrates the picture and his soulful voice adds a distinct flair. As a piece of trivia, Freeman recorded all of his narration in a single day.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of penguins and if I had the money and resources, I would own a frozen penguin refuge somewhere. I figured since I couldn't do that the next best thing I could do was to watch and then buy MARCH OF THE PENGUINS.</p></body></html>

It is a fair blood and guts movie, but it was a little too much been there, done that kind of watch.  Yes there are some cringe worthy moments, but it didn't match the original.  The only real difference between this movie and the first is that the 3 protagonists are women rather than men.  Also the whole revenge type ending was cut very short in this film so it wasn't quite as satisfying.  The thing that made the first film so dark is that you had no idea the guys were being set up, and when they were being dragged into the torture chamber you didn't know what was going to happen.  This one you see everything coming so you really don't have that sense of creepy unknown.  I think this one can wait for the unrated dvd release in 4 months.</p></body></html>

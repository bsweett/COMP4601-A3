The novel was written in 1985 and has been translated into 45 languages, so far selling more than 15 million copies worldwide, making it the most successful novel of post-war German literature. Having been known as un-filmable, the novel presented the ultimate challenge for any director who would decide to adapt it the screen. How is it possible to transfer to the screen the myriads of odors that practically crawl and jump from every sentence of each page to envelop and to overwhelm the readers?...<br /><br />"Perfume" tells the story of Jean-Baptist Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) a young man, who was born in Paris fish market in 1738 and was not supposed to live at all just like his four siblings that had been killed by their mother minutes after they were born but who survived and brought to the world with him double curse of not having any smell of his own and to be able to recognize, memorize, and later to capture every odor existed (or was that a blessing?). He grew up to become obsessed by the idea of creating the perfect perfume, the one that would capture the fragrance of love, devotion, and desire. To create the perfume like that, he would need the ingredients that could only be obtained by capturing essence of the unique scent, an indelible part of the young, beautiful, and innocent women that effortlessly evoke love, admiration, tenderness, and desire in everyone who'd approach them. Not even a human being but rather a creature for whom there is no word to describe, the monster with the divine sense of smile, the depository of myriads of odors, the evil genius obsessed by the perfection and beauty that he never was able to approach and to possess, Jean-Baptist Grenouille would stop to nothing to reach his terrifying and fascinating goal.<br /><br />I believe that Tom Tykwer made an astounding film that is perfect with the exception of a short scene few minutes before the film was over. Tykwer decided to make his anti-hero sympathetic - just for a couple of minutes and it was a wrong decision that goes against the character's logic, against everything we've learned about Jean-Baptist Grenouille. Other than that, I found the movie outstanding in all departments. It is the true Ode to Olfaction where the sense of smell was presented by the incredible, fantastic images combined with the music written by director himself and adding marvelously to the strange, dark, disturbing, and sensual world of mystery, murders, beauty, and obsession. The film director recreated the 18th century France beautifully by shooting the Paris scenes in Barcelona, Spain, and the ones that take place in Grasse, the capital of French perfumers, in Figueres, Spain, the city of Salvador Dali. Just like the novel, the film presents rather pessimistic and un-flattering outlook at the mankind and in this regard, the final two scenes are absolutely brilliant in their morbid irony.</p></body></html>

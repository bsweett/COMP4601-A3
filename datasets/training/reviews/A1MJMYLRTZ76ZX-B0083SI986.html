<meta name="summary" content="Perhaps his best"></head><body><p>Please note that I saw this movie on HBO so I can't comment on the video quality.<br /><br />Gran Torino is perhaps both Eastwood's best movie and his best acting performance yet. He plays a crusty, grumpy, hardened Korean War veteran who doesn't take you know what from anybody. He brings a brooding, smoldering intensity to the character of a retired, working-class white man who doesn't like how his neighborhood has been taken over by various minorities and gangs over the years, becoming crime ridden and the homes falling into disrepair. In fact, he seems to be the only white guy left. But despite his racist feelings, he dislikes bullies and senseless violence even more, and when he comes to the aid of the neighboring Hmong boy when he's victimized by the local Asian gang, he unwittingly and unwillingly becomes a hero to the boy and his family.<br /><br />Eastwood strikes up an awkward friendship with the boy, and teaches him the old fashioned values he grew up with: hard work, self-reliance, independence, discipline, and integrity, values that he sees very little in evidence in his now fallen neighborhood. The scene where he teaches the boy "to talk like a man" is one of the funniest scenes I've seen in any movie, so despite the overall serious tone of the movie, it's not without its humorous moments too. Overall, it's a remarkable performance and movie from Eastwood and a fitting cap to a great career. Even if he retires after this he will have gone out at the top of his game. Not many people who are still working at age 78 can say that.</p></body></html>

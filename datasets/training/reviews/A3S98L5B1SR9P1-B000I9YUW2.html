<meta name="summary" content="The Forgotten"></head><body><p>The plot of The Forgotten feels like a poorly executed attempt at an episode of the X Files. As the answer to the puzzle of the missing children is slowly revealed to the viewer, it becomes progressively less believable and ultimately ridiculous. All the tension built up through the first part of the movie is just lost in a predictable and unsatisfactory ending.<br /><br />Having said that, the movie isn't all bad. There were at least 2, maybe 3, scenes that caused the entire theater to leap right out of their seats. It was great to see Alfrie Woodard for the first time in a long time, albeit in a role unworthy of an actress of her talent. The first half of the movie is intriguing, and had the(ultimately unrealized) promise of a fairly good thriller. It was enjoyable as a free sneak-peak, but I'm glad I didn't pay $8 for it.</p></body></html>

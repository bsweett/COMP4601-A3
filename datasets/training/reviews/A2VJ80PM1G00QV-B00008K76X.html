<meta name="summary" content="HISTORY OF A NUCLEAR WEAPON-"></head><body><p>Ben Affleck is a suitably young Ryan to match the fact that he is courting his future wife; Morgan Freeman, as always, is excellent. James Cromwell does well by the President although not always well served by the scriptwriter. There are thrills aplenty as we watch, knowing that an unexploded nuclear bomb has been discovered in the Golan Heights. Who has it? What will they do with it? Finding out provides its share of thrills as the film unfolds. By far, not of the first rank, but sufficient for an entertaining two hours.<br />After my brief comment I read some of the negative reviews. Taste for films varies by individuals, as it  does for most cultural objects. I did not read the book, or if I did, it was too long ago for me to  remember the plot, so I would not comment on the relationship of the screenplay to the novel. However, I am moved, as I often am, vigorously to disagree with the notion that one can translate a book into a movie as if each word projects an exact image on screen. Words on a page are words on a page, images on a screen are images on a screen,  and never the twain will meet. Of course, some poorer novels are written essentially as screenplays so the film-maker has little trouble using them almost as is. Some movies take a highly literate book  and fail because they do not make something new out it. I am entirely on the side of Fred Astaire, who insisted to a person who was being "portrayed" in one of his films, that regardless of what she and her husband had actually done, the film demanded something other than that to be successful. As one of our ages' best artists said of painting, if what is in a painting could be said in words, you have a lousy painting. Painting is for what cannot be communicated any other way. Amusingly, there is a line given to Larry Parks (as Jolson) in Jolson Sings Again, when he is supposed to be working with the writers on The Jolson Story, in which he tells them not to stick to the truth, but to make up a good story.</p></body></html>

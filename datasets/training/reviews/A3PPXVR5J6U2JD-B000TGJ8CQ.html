The clairvoyant types are always women or kids who talk to ghosts, with the exception of Stir of Echoes...which was about a guy who talked to ghosts. It was high time we had an action-packed, testosterone-injected update of the typical precog movie.<br /><br />Our hero, Chris Johnson (Nicolas Cage) is wandering around Vegas performing magic tricks.  Something is keeping him there: normally, Johnson can only see a few minutes into the future.  But when he encounters (or will encounter) Liz Cooper (the delectable Jessica Biel) at a diner, he discovers he can see his future with her, and only with her.  At heart, Next is a star-crossed romance.<br /><br />What's entertaining about this somewhat flimsy premise is that Johnson can make it work.  Nobody as hot as Cooper would normally be interested in shlubby Johnson, but he keeps trying alternate approaches, visualizing an endless array of possibilities, until he hits on the tactic that will work.<br /><br />As you can imagine, precognition is a lot like time travel, and it's difficult to visually pull off.  Next does an excellent job of showing what Johnson sees and the innovative ways he uses his gift; at one point, we see him splitting into multiple selves (representing all the possibilities of a particular course of action).  In combat, this is really fun to watch - since Johnson can see when someone will throw a punch, he can easily dodge the blow.  He can even dodge bullets.<br /><br />Into this tidy romance steps Callie Ferris (the usually gorgeous Julianne Moore, who looks terrible in this movie), a federal agent bent on using Johnson's powers to stop a nuclear bomb from going off.  The plot spins from there. The terrorists, who are tracking Ferris, figure that Johnson must be important because the government wants so desperately to speak with him, so they try to kill Johnson.  In other words, the movie is something of a closed loop - the whole reason Johnson gets involved is because people THINK he might be important, and thus he becomes important.<br /><br />Next has its flaws, however.  For one, Cage acts like he's in a daze.  His character is bland, confused, and a little addled - not in a cool, I-have-mental-powers sort of way, but an old-man-who-forgot-his-meds sort of way.  It's not very appealing, and strains the credibility of any attraction that Biel's character would have to him.<br /><br />Speaking of Biel, she's simply too attractive for the role.  At the time of the film, Biel was 25, Cage was 43.  They seem wildly mismatched in age, personality, and temperament. Biel does a good job acting bewildered and enchanted, but she's essentially making goo-goo eyes at a walking, talking zombie.<br /><br />The other problem is that Next simply doesn't have enough of a budget to pull off all the really cool special effects in the film.  The worst is when Johnson drives a stolen car in front of a train; the train, the car, and the crash look like they were made on a Commodore 64.  It takes away from an otherwise riveting scene.<br /><br />The bad guys are non-descript Eurotrash.  Their motivation is vague, although they seem to be so powerful that the bad guys even shadow the feds without being noticed.  No wonder the only person who can defeat them is a psychic!<br /><br />When Johsnon and Ferris team up, things really get going.  There's nothing like watching a precog and a sniper work in tandem.  Or a precog wending his way through a maze trapped with bombs.  Or a precog...well, you get the picture.  It's fun stuff.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, Next plays fast and loose with the timeline.  At any point in time, we're never sure if we're seeing the future or if Johnson is actually experiencing the future.  Depending on your perspective, this is either an interesting twist on the action genre or really annoying.  The ending pivots on the phrase, "I made a mistake..."<br /><br />Was it a mistake?  I don't think so.  This little movie works with what it has.  Sometimes it might overreach, but for the most part it's an exciting science fiction action thriller.</p></body></html>

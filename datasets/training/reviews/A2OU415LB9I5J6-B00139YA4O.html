<meta name="summary" content="Lost Season 1"></head><body><p>When Oceanic Flight 815 from Australia to Los Angeles wrecks in the middle of nowhere, the survivors find themselves stranded on a deserted island in the middle of the ocean. Led by Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), a doctor back home, the survivors fend for themselves looking for shelter, hunting for food, and having to find clean water while trying to get the word out that there are survivors of the devastating crash. But when unexplainable events occur, including polar bear attacks, the new residents of the island begin to ponder the meaning of their existence on the island. Furthermore, they may not be alone.<br /><br />I'm just a little late jumping on the Lost bandwagon, partially by choice. After missing the first few episodes due to scheduling conflicts, and hearing that missing an episode would cause you to be, for lack of a better word, lost in the series, I figured I would hold off until they were further into the series before picking up the DVD's to check it out. As time went on Lost became a "water cooler sensation" and I wanted to dive in, but with the love/hate relationship people had with the series slowly unravelling it's mysteries making it pertinent that you not miss a single episode, I thought it would be better to wait till near the end of the series to start the first season. So here I am. The sixth and final season starts on February 2, 2010 and I just finished season 1. Was it worth the wait?<br /><br />Absolutely! With Lost, JJ Abrams and his team of producers and writers have created a fresh and intriguing story with characters that feel real with real arcs. Each episode focuses on an issue on the island while also focusing on a specific character's past. Even though each episode follows this patter it never feels gimmicky and allows the writers to further flesh out the characters in an interesting and inventive way, while also giving story arcs that will further flesh out the world and mythology of Lost in seasons to come.<br /><br />A lot has been made of how Lost keeps piling on mysteries while slowly solving them, if at all. After watching the first season you can definitely see the seeds of this starting to bloom, but since the first season is an introduction to the characters and their predicament, mysteries are part of the territory. Still, for better in my opinion, as the writers let you in on one secret another two or three in most cases are bound to pop up. Since this process always feels organic rather than feeling like a gimmick to keep ratings up, it keeps the viewer intrigued in the story while making the viewing experience more interactive as you try to figure out the mysteries on your own.<br /><br />The acting in this show is top notch, probably one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen for television next to Battlestar Galactica and this season's Flash Forward. With a cast that includes Naveen Andrews (Grindhouse: Planet Terror), Matthew Fox (Party of Five), Daniel Dae Kim (Crash), Evangeline Lilly (The Hurt Locker), and Dominic Monaghan (Lord of the Rings) they found a cast that more than excels at the challenge of bringing this story and these characters to life. Of all the great actors on this show, the one that really stuck out for me though is Terry O'Quinn (Primal Fear, Tombstone, The Rocketeer). As John Locke, O'Quinn really makes you feel every tick of this character, and with a character like Locke, who starts off making you wonder about his secrets and his allegiances that's not an easy task. As the season carries on you see him bring out the psychological and emotional scars buried beneath the confident exterior of the character.<br /><br />If you haven't checked out Lost I highly recommend that you jump on this wagon. The first season is a brilliant ride that will keep you guessing and engrossed in the characters. Since I've started the first season I've had a hard time putting the series down to do or watch anything else. I can't wait to get started on the second season now!<br /><br />5/5</p></body></html>

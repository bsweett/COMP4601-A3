<meta name="summary" content="Let me see that middle claw again..."></head><body><p>This is a movie I'd been looking forward to ever since rumors of its production started circulating on the Internet. And it's a movie that fans of the comic books have been waiting for over 30 years to see. Well, after all of this time, I think we can mostly thank George Lucas for developing the technology necessary to bring an incredible action film like this to life. &quot;X-Men&quot; is every bit as good as I knew it would be, just watching the previews at the movies. Just by the way the story was explained in the three minute preview, I knew that Bryan Singer was going about this the right way, which is ironically like the way the animated series went about it when it first debuted. I think I can give a lot of the credit to the cast picks, and the performances from Hugh Jackman (the best Wolverine we could've hoped for), Anna Paquin (a younger but nevertheless effective Rogue), and of course Patrick Stewart who beamed down from the Enterprise to become part of another successful franchise. Never blink during this movie - you might miss something. But I can't help but wonder what would be different if they had given Bryan Singer the extra six months he originally had... Maybe that grinding swing around one of Lady Liberty's crown-thorns wouldn't look so... unrealistic. Was I the only one who noticed that the claws looked like pasty white straight lines and Jackman looked like he wasn't even there? I didn't think so...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One can't help but think, &quot;When does Nicholson go nuts?&quot;"></head><body><p>I mean, he's as psyhchotic in the beginning as he is in the end.  Jack is talking about the people who ate each other in the olden days, a story he is telling to his son on the way to the hotel. His face and voice, however, look and sound just as freaky as they do at the end of the film. It's almost a little too hilarious. <p>The Shining is a masterpiece, a classic, yadda, yadda, you already know since all about since nearly 400 hundred people have already reviewed it. If there is an impossible chance that you know absolutely nothing about this film, you will find a great horror film about the mental breakdown of a man, only in Kubrick's version we can't really begin to see when Nicholson goes nuts. <p>NOTE TO VIEWER: There are a number of hilarious parts in this film, the scene where Nicholson is staring aimlessly out the window for one. There are, as it should be, a few very freaky parts too. Look for the boy going nuts, it's very freaky. Also, the segment about the dead lady in the tub is scary. <p>WATCH THE MAKING OF THE SHINING, it's enough to make you pee your pants in laughter.</p></body></html>

However, sentiment for the film will remain high because MR. AND MRS. SMITH will always be looked upon as the film that brought stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie together (despite having probably been involved together before working on the production).  The film opens with John and Jane Smith (Pitt and Jolie) discussing their life together and looking back on the rather bored domesticity they shared in the early years of their marriage.  Originally they found each other attractive and compatible.  But, more importantly, the marriage was a convenience for both John and Jane are top international assassins.  Their relationship enters completely different territory when both John and Jane are both sent to assassinate the same target.  They end up getting in each others' way and the man they were sent to assassinate gets away.  They vow to get rid of the other assassin.  Upon discovering that they are trying to kill each other, John and Jane have to decide whether the love they have for each other is real and worth fighting for or to keep fighting until they kill each other.<br /><br />MR. AND MRS. SMITH is slightly better than the usual action flick.  Much of this is because of the film's stars.  As much as I hate to admit it, Brad Pitt is a decent actor and Angelina Jolie is not a terrible actress.  They are both known more for their looks than their talent, but unlike many of the pretty faces that show up in movies they have some acting chops.  However, looks and talent aside, the real reason that MR.AND MRS. SMITH stands out from other similar action movies is because of the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie.  The weakest scenes in the movie are when their characters try to prevent each other from finding out what they really do for a living and when each of their characters "struggles" with how they feel for each other.  They like each other.  They like each other a lot and their passion is white smoking hot.<br /><br />Not being a fan of either Pitt or Jolie, MR. AND MRS. SMITH wasn't a film I was very excited to watch.  I will admit that it was slightly better than I thought it would be.  The story isn't especially strong and there are some scenes that make many James Bond films seem plausible and realistic.  The acting is much better than in many action flicks.  I especially enjoyed Vince Vaughn's supporting role as one of John's co-workers, Eddie.  Even though I know most will be drawn to the film because of either Pitt or Jolie or both, I was more impressed with the secondary actors in the film.  Unfortunately, they receive very little screen time at all.  Highly recommended for fans of Pitt and Jolie.  If you just enjoy watching action films, you could do better, but you could also do much worse.</p></body></html>

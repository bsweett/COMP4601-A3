<meta name="summary" content="House of broken hearts"></head><body><p>This is a painful reminder of what can happen when the law of unintended consequences follows in-step with what would seem to be a banal clerical error.  Lives become unraveled in ways you could hardly imagine.  <p>The story details a house owned by a young woman (played by Jennifer Connelly).  Somehow, she is pinged for not paying a business tax (which she does not owe).  After ignoring her mail, the house is re-possessed.  Within a day it is auctioned off to an Iranian family (the head of the household is played by Ben Kingsley).  <p>The balance of the film portrays  the heart-wrenching obstacles that she must go through to try and get her house back.  In short, the whole ordeal is a legal and logistical mess.<p>One of the most salient aspects of the film is that there are no real villains in it.  We never see the clerk(s) who screwed up in the 1st place.  The personages in the film are all basically good people, but are driven to take desperate action when the legal apparatus fails to resolve the situation.<p>The acting is top notch, and is worth the price of the DVD alone.  I've always thought that Ben Kingsley was an under-rated actor, and he shines in perhaps his most powerful performance.  Jennifer Connolley is an outstanding actress who has the most passionate eyes I have ever seen in my life.<p>If ever there were a Real Estate deal gone awry that could be elevated to the realm of a Shakespearian tragedy, this is it.  The movie is not for the feint of heart as it is actually physically painful to view.  It is depressing with an emotional poignancy I've not experienced in a long, long time.  In short, it is a Masterpiece.</p></body></html>

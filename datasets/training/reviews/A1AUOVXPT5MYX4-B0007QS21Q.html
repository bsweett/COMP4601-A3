<meta name="summary" content="A good Will Smith movie"></head><body><p>Will Smith shows a little more maturity in this one and is good as a robot-hating detective on a case that implicates a robot in a murder, something robots are not supposed to be able to do. Alan Tudyk's portrayal as Sonny, the robot with its own personality that can choose not to obey the three laws was really good. He really is the soul of the film.<br /><br />I admire the fact that director Alex Proyas tried to blend a good science fiction story with a popcorn movie mentality, although it falls well short of being a classic because of that. Even the special effects, the fights, and the bots were all good. This is one of Smith's better movies (up there with Independence Day). The film works, but one wonders what could have been if Smith didn't always try for a laugh, or if they went for a darker feel. However, despite those problems, it was a fun film.</p></body></html>

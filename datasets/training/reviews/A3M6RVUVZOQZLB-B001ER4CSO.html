Hellboy himself is amazing, especially considering his DNA. The early scene in which his Earth father reads a bedtime story about the Golden Army: How it came to be and how it was put to "sleep" --is also amazing and sets up the premise for the story at Hand (er, no offense, Hellboy). Young Hellboy is so endearing with his broken horn--you know, boys have mishaps--so believing in all his father says, so, well, downright sweet (considering his DNA).<br /><br />However, Hellboy grew up. His adult demeanor is cynical, macho. He works for a very secret branch of the FBI that houses--literally--"odd" creatures from the supernatural world. We get a glimpse of a few when the film turns to the time sequence for this story. We also learn that Liz (the fiery woman who can ignite at will) lives with her man, Red--Hellboy--and is miffed at his behavior as a domesticated male. Yet, remember that sweet side? Hellboy is totally in love with Liz.<br /><br />The most delightful scene occurs when Red takes a six-pack to Abe Sapien's room (he's the Fish Man) who has also fallen in love. After Red convinces Abe to imbibe, they start singing with Barry Manilow (of all singers!) his saccharine song "I Can't Smile Without You."<br /><br />Meanwhile, Lord Elfin wants to awaken the Golden Army and put them at his command. His goal is to declare war against humans because of the awful things they have done to the planet. Elves respect nature (remember Lord of the Ring?).<br /><br />Of course, Lord Elf gets the third piece of the crown (or we wouldn't have a battle) and finally gets his army--the indestructible golden ones. Only the progeny of royalty can challenge the royal holder of this special crown. That's where Hellboy's DNA comes in. But I'll say no more.<br /><br />Here are a few things so mysterious, so dazzling about this film:<br />1. Reminding the viewer of Hellboy's dual fathers<br />2. Setting up the current circumstances of Hellboy's life<br />3. Reminding the viewer of Hellboy's love story<br />4. Setting up the premise for the Golden Army<br />5. Dazzling special effects, both simple and boldly imaginative<br />6. The reminder of the beautiful and destructive sides of nature<br />7. The universal qualities of love<br />8. A vivid reminder that, in the end, good wins over evil.<br />9. Also, a suggestion that what seems evil may, in reality, have good intentions.<br /><br />This film comes highly recommended. Director, actors, music, cinematography, editing--it's all perfect and every second bonds with the second before and after it!</p></body></html>

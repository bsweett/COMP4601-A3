<meta name="summary" content="[4.5] The time for war has finally arrived"></head><body><p>This 5th entry in the Harry Potter series sits comfortably in what has now become a much darker and more mature series.  Though this is not be intended as violent and unappropriate at all, it is however much more than what began as a simple children's tale.  Voldomort - the evil dark Lord, is back in force, and assembling his armies of darkness while on the other hand, the armies of good are preparing for battle as well.  Hogwarts, though present throughout the film, focuses very little on actual school this time around.  The events going on in the world around Hogwarts, specifically the battle of good vs evil raging, has infiltrated the institute and placed heavy burdens on everyone inside.  And though Phoenix doesn't have all the action and humor that supplied some fo the eariler Potter films (and not a mention of Quidditch), the impressive story still makes this a superb film.<br /><br />A very serious tone surrounds the air in this film, as is a sense that there is no time for play (the overall lack of fun and humor adds to that feeling).  Still, it is a very mature and well told story, that keeps the interest of events high and suspenseful.  And though there is an overall lack of action, the climax makes up for it with an incredible visual feast of effects in an impressive duel between Dumbledore and Voldomort himself.<br /><br />The reality of death is back again, after the loss of Cedric in the previous film.  The loss of a fellow Hogwarts student looms the air, and forces Harry to come to some sort of terms with the facts, and with his crush, who had a relationship with Cedric - Cho.  In Phoenix, another dies by the end of the film, and this time it someone much closer to Harry, and the death is not taken so lightly this time, as the incredible feelings of anger begin to take over Harry.<br /><br />I say this every time I write a review for the Potter films, but we have come so far since the first int he series.  Each film adds more and more to the story, being more reality and more emotion in a very grown-up situation for simple teenagers.  The children have indeed grown up by far, but that just makes it more fun for the adults who are watching these great films.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5</p></body></html>

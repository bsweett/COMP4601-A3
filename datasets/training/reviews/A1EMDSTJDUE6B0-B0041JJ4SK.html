<meta name="summary" content="Silly but Fun"></head><body><p>I generally find this genre ridiculous, but this film is kinda silly but fun. It is creative than most and is refreshingly frank and openly honest about many things. It is like finally finding a good friend that you can trust. Good acting and not overboard in any area. Just cool.</p></body></html>

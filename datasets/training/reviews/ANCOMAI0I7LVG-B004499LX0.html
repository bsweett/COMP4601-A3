<meta name="summary" content="Time has only driven me further away from this film..."></head><body><p>While some films really get stronger and stronger with each viewing, I can't say that that is the case with `Closer'.  When I first saw the film I was totally ravaged by it and swore it a near-perfect masterpiece.  It just really spoke to me, with its blunt and harsh depictions of the realities of relationships.  The performances just wowed me in every sense of the word because I felt that bitterness and that anger and that passion.<br /><br />Then I saw it again...and again.<br /><br />As time goes by and this film turns over again and again in my head I begin to see flaws I didn't notice on the outset.  Especially when you compare this with the similarly themed yet drastically different `We Don't Live Here Anymore' (which was released the same year), `Closer' begins to feel stagnant.<br /><br />I'll get to that in a minute.<br /><br />The films premise is rather simple.  Dan is a flirtatious and charming man dating Alice, a stripper who is trying to feel a part of herself that has been missing for a long time.  Dan is attempting to become a novelist.  He meets and instantly falls for Anna, a photographer, but she isn't interested in a relationship that isn't exclusive.  So, in an attempt to seek revenge, Dan ends up sending Larry (a dermatologist) after Anna, only to have his plan backfire when the two end up hitting it off.<br /><br />Oh the twisted web we weave.<br /><br />`Closer' is never tame, and it never holds back from completely wiping our faces in the dirt that has become of their relationships ("he tastes like you, only sweeter" is still my favorite line from any movie in the past decade), but I think that in all its brave audacity one finds its biggest flaw.  `Closer' feels rather one-note.  There is no real variation of emotional complexity.  This is just a very evil film.  The performances, while seemingly powerful on the outset, lack any real longevity for me because they simply don't carry with them the range of emotion needed to make that long lasting impression.  All four actors put in some amazing work, but it's the characters that don't feel complete and so their performances don't have that well-rounded quality to them.  They are all very good at being angry and destructive.<br /><br />But, there is always Natalie Portman.  Say what you will about her lack of talent (the girl really has put in some `stinky' work during her career) but between this and `Cold Mountain', she proved that she has a lot of potential.  Maybe it was being given the only character that seemingly comes full-circle, but when all is said and done, it is Alice that I remember most of all.  While Clive Owen and Julia Roberts (Roberts is also remarkable astute in her performance and really elevates her characters lack of a real arc) may have the most volatile and explosive and memorable scenes in the film, it is Alice as a character (and thus Portman as an actress) that we will remember most, because her presence is so haunting.<br /><br />I still get shivers whenever I hear `Blowers Daughter'.<br /><br />In the end I still feel that `Closer' is a very good film, it just lacks that extra layer in order to achieve brilliance.  It comes on very strong, and so you initial reaction can be very deceiving (this is brash, this is brave, this is crushing; it must be marvelous!), but over time its lack of real emotional depth leaves it feeling rather shallow.  I highly recommend `We Don't Live Here Anymore' over this film, but as you can see, a B grade (which is what I am giving this film) is still very worth your time.</p></body></html>

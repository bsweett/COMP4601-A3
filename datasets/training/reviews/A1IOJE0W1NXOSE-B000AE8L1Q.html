She drowns herself in booze and anger and leaves her four daughters in exasperated confusion as she flounders around trying to make sense of a new life without her husband.  As her daughters are going through important passages in their lives, she continues on her bitter way, showing little support for their hopes and dreams.  Her only solace is her next-door neighbor, a former professional baseball player (Kevin Costner) who offers her companionship and understanding.  The movie seems to have an identity crisis and has moments of comedy, drama, and darkness which alternate in no particular order and for no particular purpose.  I spent the first 3/4 of the movie trying to decide where it was going and the last part, marveling at the ill-advised twist at the end. The acting was good, but the writing and plot were not and the results were very unsatisfying for this viewer.</p></body></html>

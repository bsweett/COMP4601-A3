<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding Cinema"></head><body><p>Hollywood wunderkinder Joel and Ethan Coen return with this self-penned & self-directed social commentary about ordinary guy Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who is pursued by the psychopathic hitman Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) and bemused Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), when he steals $2 million from the scene of a botched drug heist.<br /><br />Slap the phrase "Coen Bros." on the front of a movie and you can be sure of two things: you're in for an unusual and almost-always excellent film, and "No Country" is no different: this is an excellent and strange piece of cinema that reverberates long after the final credits roll. Brolin and Lee Jones give excellent performances as the sympathetic characters, as do Kelly Macdonald and Woody Harrelson (as the two more prolific supporting actors in the piece), but the show belongs wholly to Javier Bardem, whose studied, intense portrayal of Anton is absolutely terrifying and totally absorbing.<br /><br />Direction is superlative: beautiful to watch, effectively tense and very layered; the Coen-brand intelligence is never more palpable when you consider the parallels between the characters of Anton and Llewelyn, and then see the visual motifs of isolation and seclusion that the Coens use to underscore this most bizarre of relationships (deserted streets, darkened motel rooms, arid deserts and so forth).<br /><br />From a storytelling point of view, things don't begin to make sense for a half an hour or so, cleverly allowing Brolin, Bardem and Lee Jones ample time to make their presence felt - another clever touch, and one that adds more punch and muscle to this film's character-driven atmosphere.<br /><br />And then, just when you're absolutely certain that you've been treated to two hours of the finest cinema to come out of North America for a long time, the ending jumps on you and you're left with more questions than answers: this plot device is fine for a sense of ambiguity and moral questioning, but this reviewer can't help but wonder if "No Country For Old Men" wouldn't have been more satisfying with slightly more resolution?<br /><br />Still, for all that, this is a brutal and brilliant masterpiece, and one which you absolutely  shouldn't not see. It will bear repeated viewings, if only to resolve the unanswered questions for yourself.</p></body></html>

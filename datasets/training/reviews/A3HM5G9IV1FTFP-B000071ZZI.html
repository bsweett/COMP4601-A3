I just watched the first two films in the series for the first time last weekend after years of avoiding them. My impression? That so far, the "Bourne" films deserve all of the praise and success that they've received.<br /><br />"The Bourne Identity" manages to take a story with a myriad of cliches (the super spy, the spy with amnesia, secret government experiments and cover-ups, etc, etc, etc) and still make a film that's fresh, exciting, intelligent and engrossing.<br /><br />So the question is, why does this film excel when so many other action films fall flat? First, the film utilizes an excellent cast. Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is the thinking man's action hero, bringing a complexity to the role that flies in the face of the typical cocky, wisecracking American action hero. Veteran actors like Chris Cooper and Brian Cox bring gravitas to their supporting roles, and Franka Potente brings an international, quirky sex appeal to her role as Jason's love interest.<br /><br />As great as the performers are, the script and direction also really deliver. Although the action scenes are all wonderfully executed, the film makes sure not to sacrifice character development either. Jason Bourne is a man who has lost his identity, and as a result is able to regain the humanity he has clearly lost in his previous life as an assassin.</p></body></html>

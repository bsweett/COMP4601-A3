<meta name="summary" content="Very creepy movie"></head><body><p>Although there were a lot of holes in the plot that are never tied up or explained (which I'll discuss shortly), overall, I really enjoyed this film. It's actually a mystery wrapped in a horror/thriller film, and there's even a brief film within the film which is a big part of the plot, and is actually one of the scariest and creepiest things in the whole movie, and whose haunting, creepy, and disturbing images will stay with you for a long time.<p>I watched this movie without knowing much about it, so I didn't have much in the way of expectations, but after the first few minutes I was hooked and watched the whole thing, and I wasn't disappointed. I'm usually not much of a fan of the horror/thriller movie genre, because all too often they try to frighten you with a lot of gratuitous violence and gore that really isn't relevant to the movie. Although this movie has it's share of violent and gory scenes, it's much more of a psychological thriller than another cheap Hollywood gorefest, and the movie's dark and disturbing images and even the dreary and overcast Seattle and Puget Sound weather maintain an appropriately dark and creepy mood until the very end.<p>My only problem, as I said, is with a number of plot and story elements that don't make much sense, such as why the horse on the ferry became disturbed and jumped overboard when the woman lead character walked up to the horse trailer, how the video recording codes could be removed from the mysterious video tape that the people are watching, how the phone caller knows when you've watched the movie to call you, why the old farmer on Puget Sound committed suicide 20 or years after the little girl was murdered when the woman reporter came snooping around, what's causing the reporter's son to make the strange drawings that seem to relate to the murder of many years ago, why nobody was supposed to help the little girl, and even why the mother, who was said to have wanted the child more than anything in the world, murdered her daughter, and so on. And the movie's story line is complicated enough so that I'm probably missing a few. You just have to assume that there are strange, supernatural forces at work and let it go at that. <p>Those points aside, if you just ignore those problems and just go with the flow and let the movie's haunting, mysterious, creepy, and well-done visuals and images carry you along, you'll probably enjoy it like I did, and all in all, this is one of the scariest and most suspenseful movies I've seen in a long time.</p></body></html>

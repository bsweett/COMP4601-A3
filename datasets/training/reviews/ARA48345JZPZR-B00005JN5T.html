<meta name="summary" content="Painfully unfunny."></head><body><p>This awful tripe is of the "squirm" school of comedy.  People are so obnoxious or do such odious and tasteless things that the only logical response is discomfort.  Like watching your best friend get drunk and make an ass of himself or herself at a wedding or funeral.  That kind of thing.<br /><br />It can be done well. And judging by the movie's popularity I guess there are legions who found the godawful Fockers contrasted with the uptight DeNiro hilarious.  I wasn't one of them.  I found it especially apalling considering the wealth of talent in front of the cameras.  DeNiro, Stiller, Hoffman and Streisand, and it sucked?  Yep.  Sorry.  I couldn't wait for this one to be over.<br /><br />The first film had some of this discomfort humor too, but that film actually had its moments, with Stiller's geometric progression of effups becoming increasingly absurd and funny.  But here his parents were so completely obnoxious and inappropriate at all times (to my mind) that it was just one labored scene after another with some people you wouldn't want to know if your life depended on it.  DeNiro was so stiff reacting to these old hippies that he was a pain in the ass too.<br /><br />Anyway, the only way to enjoy this film was to detest these people, and I didn't want to waste the time.</p></body></html>

To be honest, I did not think I was going to like it and the first five minutes of the film seemed to confirm it.  I found his character dull and uninteresting.  But as the movie developed and the character's dullness was revealed to be an extension of his sedated state (both emotionally and physically), the film really took on a new shape.  Unlike many who have commented that the film is not a comedy, I certainly think it is.  I found myself laughing my ass off at a few lines in particular and thought the entire movie was delivered with a nice touch of humor.  Moreover, it is a comedy in the sense of the overall arch of the main character.  However, I suppose that if one's definition of a "comedy" is a film done in the style of a SNL production, then this film will probably not please.  This is not _Old School_--it is a bit of a dark comedy about reconnecting with the world again.<br /><br />There are a few scenes in this film that are superbly well done, parts where the script connects with the audience and everything comes together.  Fortunately, there are enough of them to make up for any awkwardness in the pacing that results from any movie attempting to balance itself between humor and emotional intensity.  This film is certainly worth a rent and even purchasing if you can find it for a decent price.  With wonderful acting, a great oddball script and premise, and what is quickly becoming acknowledge a stellar soundtrack, _Garden State_ delivers exactly what it promised and much, much more.  Be sure to check out the documentary on the making of the film included on this DVD version.</p></body></html>

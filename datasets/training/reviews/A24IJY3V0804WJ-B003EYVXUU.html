The original film was based in Blackeberg, Stockholm but the in the American version the action has shifted to a small town in New Mexico. Director Matt Reeves has chosen the year 1980 as the year in which things unfold, this has to do with the Reagan American thought process of the time of good and evil, communism. There is Owen (Kodi Smith- Mcphee) who is fighting his own fight with the school bullies, he is terrorized every day. He is lonely and friendless, it is during this time that a young girl Abby, a 250 year old vampire, according to the original book (Chloe Grace Moretz) moves next door to him and they begin an unlikely friendship which will change their lives forever.<br />I would not go in to details about the films pace and events as I think it would give away the story but this is in short, a very remarkable film about loneliness, finding friendship and companionship in the most unlikely places. The pace is slow and the director has not relied on sounds and CGI to bring the story to life. The horror is very subtle and the acting is amazing, two gifted young children have given such a good performance that it would give many grown up actors a run for their money. The cinematography is splendid and so are the other supporting actors. Nothing has changed from the original film; the soul is still intact only the setting has changed with a few minor changes. I highly recommend this film 4 stars. 6/20/2011</p></body></html>

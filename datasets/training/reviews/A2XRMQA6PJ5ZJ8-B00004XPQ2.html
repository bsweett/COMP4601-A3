<meta name="summary" content="Very possibly the greatest war movie ever."></head><body><p>This is a great movie about a great story.  It was a big budget movie featuring awesome scenery and cinamatography. As if that were not enough, the film is embellished with bravo performances by William Holden, Alec Guiness, Jack Hawkins, Sessue Hayakawa and others.  No wonder &quot;Kwai&quot; won no fewer than seven academy awards in 1957 including Best Picture.<p>The story is brutally simple.  British (and one or two American) POWs in Southeast Asia are being forced to work in railway gangs for the Japanese.  The struggle between the British POWs and the Japanese makes for a great story, as the British Senior POW and the Japanese commander engage in a battle of wills.  The outcome of the film packs a wallop, and I found it to be very satisfying.  This movie never drags, and is punctuated with humor although the overall tone is deadly serious.<p>One nice thing about this film is that although it does not in any way glorify war or whitewash the awful consequences of war, it also avoids gratuitous violence, and is suitable for fairly young viewers to watch. <p>This is quite possibly the greatest war movie ever made.  What more can one say?</p></body></html>

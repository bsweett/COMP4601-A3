He realizes he can use his power for good, and becomes Daredevil to correct the wrongs in the city he lives in.  The movie is not super fantastic, I guess I did not really like Ben Affleck in the role, and the fighting scenes just seemed too stiff, and not fluid and natural.  I did like the scene where a young daredevil fights three bullies blind was really nice.  Colin Fareel as bullseye was excellent casting.  He plays crazy really well.  Him losing the power to use his hands renders him powerless.  Nice touch.  I also liked Micheal Clarke Duncas as Kingpen.  With his imposing size he made a good villan.  The movie ending left room for a potential sequel......which I hope they don't do!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="So Many Awards and So Many Memorable Lines"></head><body><p>CASABLANCA is the favorite movie of many fans for good reasons. They can really be summed up in the numerous Academy Awards and Academy Award nominations given to the film. The combination of superior direction, acting, cinematography and a superb screenplay doesn't come together in one package too often.<p>Bogart, Bergman and Paul Henreid work together beautifully. The supporting cast is incredibly deep in talent. S.Z. Sakal, Madeleine LeBeau and Leonid Kinsky are tough to beat. Is it possible that this is only Dooley Wilson's first film? Added to this mix is the veteran star quality of Claude Rains, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet.<p>Few movies leave us with so many memorable lines such as "We'll always have Paris" or "Round up the usual suspects" or "Here's looking at you - kid." In this respect CASABLANCA is reminiscent of THE MALTESE FALCON and GONE WITH THE WIND.<p>For the record the Academy Awards were for best picture, best director (Michael Curtiz) and best screenplay (Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein and Howard Koch).<p>The Academy Award nominations were for best actor (Humphrey Bogart), best supporting actor (Claude Rains) and best cinematography (Arthur Edeson).</p></body></html>

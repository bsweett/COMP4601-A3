<meta name="summary" content="Too much praise for a regular movie"></head><body><p>After building a career of "nice guys", smiling, funny and even sometimes silly characters, Robin Williams recently decided he could play the bad guy. "One hour photo" is an example, and the more recent "Insomnia" is another (I haven't watched "Death to Smoochy"). I always thought Robin Williams was a one-character actor, meaning he couldn't change his performances from one movie to another - even the psychologist in "Good Will Hunting" and the troubled husband in "What dreams may come", like all other Williams' characters have a sound resemblance to Patch Adams. Well, in "One hour photo" and in "Insomnia" I was proved wrong. Not only Williams can play a problematic and sad character, he can be very convincing (although we always feel sorry for him). <p>In "One hour photo", the Yorkes (Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan and Dylan Smith) seem the perfect family for Sy Parrish (Robin Williams), the "photo guy" from a ... store. Sy is obsessed about the family. All the photo-sets the Yorke family get from Sy have a copy in Sy's house. When Sy gets to know the Yorkes aren't so perfect after all, he slowly but surely starts to plan his revenge. <p>Being a movie essencially about obsession and photography, "One hour photo" is full of light (there is a light bulb, or the sun, or the moonlight in EVERY scene) and colorful. It just didn't work for me, because I was supposed to be watching a thriller, and in my conception (maybe I'm too old-fashioned) thrillers don't work if they're light- and colorful. <p>Mark Romanek's script isn't innovative. His direction is confused, blending old and new technics during the movie. About the actors: Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan have been better (in "Gladiator" and "Alias", respectively), but theirs are average performances. The kid, Dylan Smith, is rather good. The best performance is by Robin Williams, different from everything I'd seen him doing. <p>In the end, the best thing in the movie was the Yorkes' house (I'm an architect).<p>I give this movie only three stars mainly because I was expecting one thing and got one totally different. <p>Grade 6.8/10</p></body></html>

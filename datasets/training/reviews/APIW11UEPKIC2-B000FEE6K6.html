<meta name="summary" content="Very good movie"></head><body><p>I rented this along with unleashed, two for the money, saw, constant gardener, and transporter 2.  It was obviously better than transporter, but it was easily the best of the bunch.<br /><br />This movie really does nothing too special, but it is a story that we haven't seen before.  Nicholas Cage plays a gun-runner/conman.  There is no huge plot in this movie, but Nick's bro has some major issues.  His wife becomes a pretty good character even though I would have liked to see some more conversations between them.<br /><br />What this movie does do is capitilize on every oppurtunity that it had, this is not billed as a huge action thrill ride, and rightly.  The action is mainly those funny suspensful moments when you know the star is gonna figure something out to get out the stuation.  Best I've seen Nick Cage since 8 millimeter.</p></body></html>

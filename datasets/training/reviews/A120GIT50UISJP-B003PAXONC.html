<meta name="summary" content="A fascinating exploration of sanity and the will to survive."></head><body><p>There is a theme that runs through many horror films: the monster is initially welcomed as a wonder, then feared and reviled as its true nature becomes apparent. Attempts to destroy it fail, but an uneasy detente is reached by the end. I Am Legend is a fascinating instantiation of this theme, saved from being a takeoff on 28 Days Later by its deep exploration of loneliness and humanness.<br /><br />The genetically engineered virus that cured cancer mutated into something that deprived its victims of their skin pigmentation and their ability to control their survival impulses. Those that survive its 90% kill rate turn into dark-seekers, creatures whose skin burns at the touch of light, and whose carnivorous urges compel them to feed on any living animal, including humans. But some intelligence remains; they can set traps, act in coordinated fashion while hunting, train infected dogs to assist them in the kill, catch the eye of a man standing in the sunlight and give a look that says, "you win this one, but wait until dark." We are brought to wishing that they didn't have minds any longer, so hideous their existence, but they do have minds, and the thought of being one of those millions who didn't die is worse than death.<br /><br />Just one percent of the human population is immune to this virus, and one of them is Robert Neville [Will Smith], an Army virologist who finds himself at the epicenter of the outbreak, Long Island. He has no reason to go on. His family was killed trying to evacuate the Island; he broadcasts a call to any other unaffected human and waits every day on the pier at midday for those who hear it to come to him. But no one ever does. But Robert has a will to survive, and that will must be given some purpose, so he constructs a basement lab and continues the search for a cure, accompanied only by his dog, Samantha.<br /><br />I Am Legend is far from perfect. It is, after all, yet another good-scientist-does-evil-by-unleashing-a-virus-that-creates-cannibalistic-humans flick. But it is also about sanity, the human need to have purpose and companionship, the scientist who finds that he also needs faith. Mix those all together, and you have quite an interesting movie.</p></body></html>

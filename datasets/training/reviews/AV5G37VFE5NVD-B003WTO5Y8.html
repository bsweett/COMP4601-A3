THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a horror-thriller-drama in one, a masterpiece of modern cinema that swept in five Academy Awards including Best Picture.  Loosely adapted from the best-seller by Thomas Harris, the film follows Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), a young FBI trainee who must play an imprisoned cannibal genius' (Anthony Hopkins) mind games while trying to single-handedly track down a psychotic serial killer (Ted Levine).  THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is deservedly a legend, which was followed by three sequels (chronologically, the film occurs after it's second sequel, RED DRAGON).  Let me try to sum up my good thoughts in words.  Jonathan Demme turns this from a masterpiece to a work of art with his outstanding direction and intriguing Point-of-View shots; Ted Tally writes the creepy, intelligent screenplay; then there's a short but very nice score by Howard Shore.  Foster is at her best and portrays the character better than anyone else could try; Scott Glenn is good as her section chief, and Anthony Heald is good as the annoying and ignorant Dr. Chilton; Levine is very good as well, and brings out the character just as he should be.  But the true highlight of the film is Anthony Hopkins as polite and genius Dr. Hannibal &quot;The Cannibal&quot; Lecter; Hopkins gives his best performance and one of the best performances ever captured on film - there is no doubt in my mind Hannibal Lecter is the ultimate villain.  THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS must be seen to believed.  Make sure you take a bite out of this artful masterpiece!</p></body></html>

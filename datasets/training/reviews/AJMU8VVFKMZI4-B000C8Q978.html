I kept looking for this "Don Juan" to show up and I just didn't see what made him such a lady's man.  I found his neighbor Winston interesting.  I thought his love for mysteries endearing, plus, he seemed to know Don better than he knew himself.  As much as I found the subject matter interesting, the pacing can try the average viewer.  It was just a bit too slow for my taste and I really don't care for open endings like this.  But there are some things to like about the production.</p></body></html>

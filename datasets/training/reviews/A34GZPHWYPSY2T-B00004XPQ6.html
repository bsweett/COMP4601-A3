I'd have loved this film with Ford rather than Gibson, yet I can understand why Ford got angry about this fairy tale in lieu of some more solid, reliable history.<br /><br />The year is 1776, and on the Martin farm it looks like all peace and tranquility. News of the Revolution is anxiously awaited by Benjamin's sons Gabriel (Heath Ledger, how sad to see him looking so young and beautiful) and Thomas (equally lovely Gregory Smith). They want to sign up and fight. Martin is opposed to the war, though he concedes America ought to be free.<br /><br />Gabriel enlists and Benjamin can't stop him. Later, Benjamin is quartering both British and American wounded at his home. The Darth Vader of England, Col. William Tavington (Jason Isaacs) shows up, gets irked and burns the Martin house to the ground after murdering the American wounded. Benjamin still resists any involvement, but hits the ceiling when finally, young Thomas is murdered by Tavington.<br /><br />This is when The Ghost is born. Martin tears off after the officers who have Gabriel and dispatches them with heavenly force. I have to say, when we first saw this film, we thought it had great stuff in it that has influenced lots of subsequent films. Director Roland Emmerich (of several favorites of mine including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OQCV2E">2012</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012Q732O">10,000 B.C.</a> - vid. my review - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMXX">The Day After Tomorrow (Widescreen Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005V9IK">Independence Day (Single Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>) took his time with this.<br /><br />With extensive help and consultation courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution, Emmerich delivered a picture-perfect, detailed rendering of that era not to be matched until HBO gave us <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WGWQG8">John Adams</a>. Though a fictional story, most of the characters are based on real folks. General Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson) is all too real. The Smithsonian even allowed the producers to examine genuine uniforms from the period, and one of the producers remarked how moved he was when he saw sweat stains in a uniform's collar. He remarked, "It was the sweat of the endeavor to free this country!"<br /><br />There are too many stellar performers to list them all - but now here comes the ugly of it: this movie LOVES the slow-mo, and it gets irritating in a film that is 165 minutes long. There is a lot of sub-par operatic music by John Williams, but an equally generous number of brilliant themes that show up in the HARRY POTTER films too. The dialogue is too modern, and is sometimes just as irritating as the shots of a screaming Mel Gibson smearing themselves at a snail's pace across the screen.<br /><br />It is this along with the fact that this story is a work of fiction that makes it too much of a fairy tale for my taste - but then, I am not complaining and I never did complain about that. Hopefully this will silence the unworthy criticism of anyone who states the fact that this is a fictional story. It is barely - just barely - based on a true character and events.<br /><br />Furthermore, though I thought I detected a few added scenes in this special-edition DVD, the special features are pretty rotten. Only an hour-long documentary or a piecemeal documentary with good information can make such a DVD release truly "special" - and this thing is missing all that in spades.<br /><br />All in all, if it is understood this is a fantasy (or "fairy tale") film with painstaking detail, it is not only worthy of viewing; it's darned good. You may not feel so patriotic about it, but you'll feel it's a good film. Many reviewers here seem to despise it for some reason, but I loved it overall. One doesn't need to be a historian - or claim to be a historian - to love a film like this.<br /><br />However, I think they'd have gotten a lot more mileage out of it if they had entitled it "The Ghost", made it closer to an actual historic event, and had not stinted on some of the matters of good taste.<br /><br />One final note: while I made what I saw as good edits to this review, I did not do it for the happiness or edification of any other reviewer here. Or any commenter, or any random screwy person. I frequently edit my reviews to improve them. So I will not be adding any names to the review's authorship or thanking anyone in particular. I do all this hard work on my own.</p></body></html>

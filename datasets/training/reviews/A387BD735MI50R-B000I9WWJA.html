<meta name="summary" content="Jigsaw Puzzle with Pieces Missing"></head><body><p>I watched this movie through twice, and then a third time with director Spike Lee's commentary. And I still don't quite get it. It seems to be a table full of pieces that just don't fit together.<br /><br />For example, what was Jodi Foster doing in this movie? What did her character accomplish? What did Christopher Plummer get, or think he had gotten, when he handed that check over to her? She doesn't seem to perform any function here, other than to cut a fine female figure.<br /><br />It seems we have a lot of A-List stars strutting their stuff, in search of a logical script. Denzel Washington basically reprises his role as Malcolm X. Well, he's a hostage negotiator here rather than a civil rights leader. But he stands and delivers with the same quick, snappy patter. He strides down the street with the same confident air, right down to the way he shears the brim of his hat jauntily into place.<br /><br />Jodi Foster may uncharacteristically play a character of dubious morality in this film. But she tackles her assignment with characteristic intelligence and command. In the same way, most of the actors are playing to type, and do not stretch beyond their usual projections. They all meet in the arena of this bank hesit in the personas we have come to associate with them. But these good actors don't form an ensemble. They aren't given a logical reason for occupying the same screen space.<br /><br />I said that this movie was like a jigsaw puzzle with some pieces missing. Actually, it's worse. The pieces we have are colorful shards that form some interesting patterns as they twist and turn. But they ultimately seem to come from several different pictures altogether.<br /><br />The whole movie is like its concluding music. As the closing credits roll, we hear a rap song juxtaposed against a Bollywood ditty that I guarantee you won't be able to get out of your head. They are both good pieces of music. But they have no logical reason for being stuck together here - other than the fact that they both must have struck Spike Lee's fancy.<br /><br />So ultimately this is a pack rat's nest of shiny baubles drawn from different places. Still, it's good to look at.</p></body></html>

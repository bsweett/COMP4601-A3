<meta name="summary" content="An Average Film From A Normally Above Average Actor"></head><body><p>I am what you might call a huge Kevin Spacey fan. I've enjoyed all of his films to date ...with the exception of this one.<br /><br />The plotting of "The Usual Suspects" left me gasping and laughing and clapping. "The Shipping News" left me equally impressed, as did "K-Pax" and "American Beauty". But here I feel that Mr. Spacey went a bit beyond his reach, and beyond his age.<br /><br />First, let me say that I love Bobby Darin's voice. "Splish-Splash" and "Mack the Knife" are two of my favorite oldies. They're snappy tunes with a distinctive quality to them. Whenever I hear them on the radio, I turn it up. But now, there may be a "stain" in my memory thanks to this film. Spacey is not, could never be, Bobby Darin. It is, to the best of my knowledge, the first time Spacey has ever portrayed an actual historical character, let alone a musical legend, and he didn't pull it off very well.<br /><br />Spacey's love of the material shines through more than the material itself. To his credit, Kevin Spacey gives it his all, trying to sing and dance his way into our hearts. But, unfortunately, he is NOT Bobby. The plotting of the film tries to dismiss Spacey's advanced years by showing us a film being made within this film; a film based on the life of Bobby Darin. But Spacey is so much older than Bobby Darin ever was that his performance rang hollow.<br /><br />And although Spacey can sing, he cannot sing up to the quality of Bobby Darin. Whenever a song was presented during the film, I could instantly tell which ones were being sung by Darin and which by Mr. Spacey.<br /><br />The musical numbers involving choreographed dance sequences also weren't up to today's standards. Moulin Rouge and Chicago were far superior productions.<br /><br />There were some decent moments in the film; for instance whenever Bobby Darin first meets Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth), and doesn't let up swooning her until she agrees to marry him. And when he finally accepts who his true mother was (tear-jerking).<br /><br />Although it had it's good moments, the bad dialogue, scripting, dancing, and songs not sung by Darin himself, made this a tough film to watch. But I'd be willing to bet that big time Bobby Darin fans will love it to pieces.</p></body></html>

There were a lot of extra scenes that could have easily been left out, or cut shorter. Al Pacino did a great job (as always), and De Niro did well with what they gave him to work with, which wasn't great. Val Kilmer was not needed to play his part, as was the same situation with Ashley Judd's character, and with Jon Voight's. For a better Michael Mann film, see The Insider. Heat was fine to watch once. It had its good elements, but not enough to spend another three hours for a second viewing. It is not something that kids would enjoy, and its R rating is due to violence and language.</p></body></html>

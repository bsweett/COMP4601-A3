<meta name="summary" content="Not Good at All"></head><body><p>I knew this was a lackluster movie before I watched it, but I was desperate for HD DVD material.  While it was not painfully bad, it was boring and superficial.  Jennifer Aniston basically plays herself (or any of her other characters on TV/movies.)  She is confused and not sure she wants to marry her fiance-snooze.  If that was not enough, Aniston-in typical golddigger [...]fashion-sleeps with Kevin Costner.  This is the man she suspected of being her father and she knew had slept with her grandmother!  But because he is rich and powerful she jumps in the sack with him.  The lone bright spot is the grandmother played by the great Shirley Maclaine, but even some of her lines seem forced and fall flat.  The HD DVD version is crammed onto a single (15 GB) layer of the disc so the picture quality is only ok (the DVD version occupies the other layer).  If you have absolutely nothing else to do then perhaps this is worth watching.  But I recommend you find another diversion.</p></body></html>

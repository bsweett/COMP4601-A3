The act of magic is described in its three parts - "the pledge," in which the audience is introduced to an object of interest; "the turn," in which the object is transformed, and "the prestige," in which the object is restored. The movie itself is probably built on these three concepts, though a single viewing is hardly enough to say for sure. But superb writing keeps the audience guessing through a maze of false appearances and hidden motivations. Like a real magic trick, the viewer wonders how it was done - how was perception manipulated so subtly so that what one thinks one sees is not what is there at all?<br /><br />Working class Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and aristocratic Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) are the dueling early-20th century English prestidigitators. The stakes are high: the revelation of Borden's greatest trick - The Transported Man. The trick is a doozy, involving an impossible disappearance and reappearance. Borden - as great a magician as he is lousy a showman -- has perfected the trick - eerily so - and though Angier can duplicate it, he becomes obsessed with learning how Borden did it. Managing to obtain Borden's secret diary and compromise mistress, Angier travels to Colorado where he is led to ever-spooky electronics genius Nicola Tesla.<br /><br />"The Prestige" is itself one enormous illusion. There are so many twists and turns and reversals, that neither the characters nor the viewer can truly follow the action. This required a prodigious feat of intelligent writing, but it is pulled off admirably. The plot illusions, like their magical counterparts, are obvious when the viewer knows how they are done. One of the movie's special pleasures is to rewatch it knowing how the illusions are done. Amazingly, character motivations and actions that "read" one way the first time, read perfectly well in the opposite direction as well. Incredible.<br /><br />Michael Caine was a standout in the film - the old showman always concealing as much as he revealed. Jackman was passable - his sullen stage manner made one wonder how his character became so famous. Bale was alternately an emotional cipher and an engaging husband, father and magician. I would like to think that this was in keeping with the film's secret, of which you will not hear a word from me. And a surprise - David Bowie made the most amazing, low-key and proudly weird Tesla ever. He was mysterious, spookily intelligent and convincingly obsessed with his inventions.<br /><br />A most tightly-wrought and exquisitely-produced film.<br /><br />...and now you don't.</p></body></html>

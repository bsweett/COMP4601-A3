<meta name="summary" content="Viva Viggo and Cronenberg"></head><body><p>Saw the trailer to this movie and I must say I was hooked. I went to see it the other day and I was not disappointed in the least. Viggo Mortenson was just tremendous. His portrayal of the Russian Mafia godfathers sons driver was powerful, menacing and dead on. Vincent Cassel was also perfect in the role of the son of the Russian mobster. Naomi Watts was aslo great as usual. The only thing I can say that some might be turned off by is the VERY graphic violence but it goes right along with the subject though it is a bit hard to watch sometimes.<br /><br />I will buy this when it comes out on DVD. I recommend it.</p></body></html>

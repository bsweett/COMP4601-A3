Of the entire cast the only actor I actually enjoyed on a regular basis was William H. Macy and so I didn't have the highest of hopes for this film.  That said, I was blown away with how funny this movie really is.  I mean, I was laughing just about the whole way through, and while Macy probably gives the funniest performance here the entire cast really hold their own as well.  One of my initial arguments going into this movie was that believing Martin Lawrence would be friends with the likes of Allen, Travolta and Macy was a bit far fetched.  They just seem to be cut from a different mold.  I was so very wrong.  Lawrence really left his `Martin' days behind here and has advanced as a comedian.  He's matured and is so believable here.  All four actors really fit well together, and that is a big plus to the enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />The film follows four friends, Woody, Doug, Bobby and Dudley as they take off on the adventure of their lives to find themselves, escape the pressures of their lives and release the stress that just keeps building.  Woody is going through a nasty divorce from his supermodel wife although he refuses to admit anything is wrong to his friends.  Doug is facing stress from work and just needs to escape.  Bobby has family issues to work through, namely the lack of support from his wife and mother-in-law and Dudley just really needs a woman.  Together they make up `The Wild Hogs', their idea of a motorcycle gang, and so it's with leather jackets tightly fastened and Harley's between their legs that they set off for self discovery.  Once they leave for the open road though any and everything you can imagine goes seriously wrong.<br /><br />The gags within the film may not be all fresh and or original (I don't know why every comedy feels the need for the homosexual gags...sure some are funny but they just seem to overdo it at times) but the execution is well thought out and there are plenty of redeeming moments to help you forgive the missteps.  I love John C. McGinley on `Scrubs' but here he did nothing for me.  His character was just too over the top (although I did laugh at some of his scenes).<br /><br />Two supporting actors that are worth their weight here are Marisa Tomei and Ray Liotta.  As Jack, Ray completely steals the scenes he embodies.  His rebel gang leader is so harsh yet so hysterically on point.  You hate him yet want to see more of him.  As Maggie, Marisa is confident, endearing and so beautiful.  Although one may gawk at someone of her level of beauty falling for William H. Macy, but they play this side plot off so well it becomes very believable.<br /><br />There are plenty of scenes within `Wild Hogs' that will make the viewer chuckle and then plenty to evoke full on belly laughs.  A note to all who have not seen this film, as funny as it all is you MUST wait till the credits begin to roll for the biggest surprise.  Lets just say a gag involving a real motorcycle gang and a spoof on `Extreme Makeover: Home Edition' had me in tears it was so funny.  Seriously, it alone makes this movie worth OWNING.  So, in the end, I was wrong about `Wild Hogs'.  I expected to leave the theater pointing at my wife (who insisted we go) and saying "I told you so" as we left disgusted at the waste of time.  Instead I actually think I enjoyed the film more than she did.  I highly recommend this film.  Sure it's not perfect but it's a nice twist on the coming of age film sporting some really nice comedic performances by the entire cast.  And like I said, that closing scene is just priceless, truly and utterly priceless.</p></body></html>

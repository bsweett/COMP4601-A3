<meta name="summary" content="A touching story of hope and friendship"></head><body><p>A salesman and a hitman meet in a bar in Mexico City. What results is a touching tale of hope and friendship between two people who couldn't be more different. Well, sort of. Actually, "The Matador" is a really entertaining and hilarious film.<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan, who seems to be favouring character roles now that he is getting too old to play heroes, plays Julian Noble, a burnt out hitman who happens to meet Greg Kinnear's struggling salesman while on a job in Mexico. As Noble, Brosnan is over the top and hilarious to watch. He's hyperactive, in your face and not in the least bit apologetic for it. Kinnear arguably has the harder role of the two, as his character is essentially just there to witness the actions of Noble, and yet he manages to make his character believable and more than just a spectator.<br /><br />The plot of this film is nothing new, you could argue that it is just "The Odd Couple" with sex and violence. Yet, it is well done, and although not the most memorable of films, watching it did provide me with a good evening's entertainment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An excellent movie with great special effects still stands up with today's Sci-Fi."></head><body><p>Nostromo, a spaceship returning to Earth with a mineral load, suddenly changes course automatically to investigate a distress call, originating from an unknown planet. This is the beginning to a frightening meeting with an alien showing no mercy to other races.<br /><br />Having seen this film recently reminds me that it's quite possibly one of the 5 best science fiction films of all time. The atmospheric feel of the movie is incredibly realistic, which only adds to the movie's suspense. Even if you have seen the un-cut version of the movie, this novelization adds so much more to the story.<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott has become one of the most respected men within movie-making today. With films like `Alien,' `Bladerunner' and `1492: Conquest of Paradise,' he has shown that visually stunning films with deep suspense have much to offer. `Alien' was his first and best movie, with its dark and terrifying atmosphere it showed the unknown side of space.<br /><br />In the Academy award it won for its impressive visual effects. `Star Trek: The Motion Picture' lost its nominations in the same category. Other than that, all die hard Sci- Fi fans should already have this unless you are unto your second copy, as for the rest it's a must have.</p></body></html>

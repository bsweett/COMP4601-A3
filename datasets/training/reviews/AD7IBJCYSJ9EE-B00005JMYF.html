<meta name="summary" content="Great movie & DVD!"></head><body><p>When I first saw Dodgeball in theaters, I loved it. But I knew there would be a double-dip DVD. You know, they release a DVD, and a few months later, they release a better DVD. So looks like I'll be reviewing the brand new DVD!<br /><br /> The story consists of two gyms. The first one is the Globo gym, a giant gym owned by White Goodman [played marvously by Ben Stiller.] And the other is the Average Joe's gym, owned by Peter, and the people who go there aren't normal. Peter. being in debt, discovers if he doesn't pay $50,000, he will lose the gym and White will take over it. After reading about a $50,000 dollar prize dodgeball competion in Las Vegas, he tries to master dodgeball.<br /><br /> If you are looking for a story with great plot and character development, look elsewhere. But if you love a great, funny comedy, see Dodgeball!<br /><br /> This new Unrated DVD is packed with great bonuses. An audio commentary, featurettes, deleted scenes w/ optional commentary, an alternate ending [which sucks], bloopers, and more. A must have.<br /><br /> PS: Press Enter each time White Goodman snaps his fingers [he does it 4 times] during the movie for some Easter eggs, including a second commentary!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""I Can See Why This Film Is A Classic""></head><body><p>"Star Trek 2: The Wrath Of Khan" explores the demension of these characters and takes the "Star Trek" saga to a different level. What happened to the "Star Trek" saga, well Nicholas Meyer directed only a few of the "Star Trek" films, and maybe thats why some of these film are horrible. I hate "Star Trek" now, they replaced Admiral James t. Kirk(yes I said his full name) with Patrick Stewart, who plays a different captain, what were these guy's thinking(I think it maybe Patrick Stewart, I haven't kept up). "The Wrath Of Khan" quotes the most famous line of them all,"Revenge is a dish best served cold." I love that line, it should be in the hall of fame of famous lines, like that line in "Titanic" "I'M THE KING OF THE WORLD."<br /><br />THE PLOT<br /><br />It is the 23rd century. The Federation Starship U.S.S. Enterprise is on a routine training and Admiral James Kirk(William Shatner) seems resigned to the fact that this may well be his last mission of his career. But Khan is back.<br /><br />This is a very good film, but it doesn't even compare to "The Search for Spock", that is my favorite "Star Trek" film.</p></body></html>

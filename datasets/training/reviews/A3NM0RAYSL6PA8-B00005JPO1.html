This lousy mish-mash of a film stinks of his tone-deaf storytelling, although he surely isn't alone shouldering the blame. Spielberg, after all, let him get away with it, and David Koepp (an otherwise decent screenwriter) gets credit for taking Lucas' "story" and trying to make sense out of it. Much like Episodes I through III tarnished the three original Star Wars films, this sad, overly long exercise makes the original Indy films feel like Oscar contenders.</p></body></html>

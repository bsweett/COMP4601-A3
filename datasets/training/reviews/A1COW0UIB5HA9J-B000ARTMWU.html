Later at night, there's a crazed killer that slaughters her family and kidnaps her as her best friend must follow his trail so he can free her and fight off the madman.<br /><br />This French horror thriller written and directed by Alexandra Aja and produced by an uncredited Luc Besson ( "Leon", "The Fifth Element") is one of the new century's best horror movies. There's some good performances here with shocking gore effects by Italian special make-up effects wizard Giannetto De Rossi, the film is a chilling and relentless edge-of-your-seat thrill ride that keeps you guessing till the bizarre ending and has horrifying images to make the viewer disturbed.<br /><br />This Unrated DVD contains scenes which were trimmed originally from the MPAA during the U.S. Theatrical release to avoid an "NC-17" rating are restored on this DVD and there's some decent extras like commentaries, featurettes, music montage, and trailers.

<meta name="summary" content="Night Terrors"></head><body><p>The Good Things:<br />*Good, exciting, engaging story with lots of action.<br />*No shortage of violence and gore; fans of blood and guts should be satisfied with this.<br />*Some action scenes are downright awesome (like when Cherry uses her leg-gun to kill a bunch of zombies...).<br />*Characters are good.<br />*Dialogue is good.<br />*Music is great.<br /><br />The Bad Things:<br />*This is definately the grossest movie I have ever seen.  Lots of gut-ripping, heads-exploding, brain-eating, torrents-of-blood, melting tallywackers, and other gross bits all over the place.<br />*Also lots of disturbing tidbits (but could also be good, because it makes the film edgy).<br />*Some campiness and plenty of parts that are very absurd (but this could be a good thing, because it's stylish and entertaining).<br />*All of the movie is made to look old on purpose (which I think is good, because it's adds some interesting effects and serves as homage to 70s films (and older "Grindhouse" films)).<br /><br />At last, a zombie movie that's not overly dreary, dumb, or boring! Much like "Sin City," this film is an action flick with lots of blood and gore, but with none of the seriousness of "Dawn of the Dead" or "28 Days Later." Instead, you can have fun with this one.  It may not be as deep or intelligent as other zombie movies, but it still has good characters, some suspense, and a pretty good story.  Highly reccomended for anybody who likes blood and gore, zombie movies, or absurd movies (like "Sin City" or "Shoot 'Em Up").<br /><br />This feature was released alongside with "Death Proof," which is sold separately (but I think $20.00 is still good enough for one good movie).</p></body></html>

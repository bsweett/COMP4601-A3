<meta name="summary" content="Fitting tribute to a wonderful show"></head><body><p>The movie version of A Prairie Home Companion is a fictionalized version of the real thing. Garrison's detective Guy Noir (played by Kevin Kline) is actually a character in the film, providing security for the weekly radio show. Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin and Woody Harrelson play fictional musicians and old-time singers. Supporting them is much of Companion's weekly crew - including The Guys All-Star Show Band, Peter Ostroushko and Tom Keith, the sound effects man. The plot is that this is the last show before the theater is sold to a wealthy Texan who plans to tear it down for a parking lot.<br /><br />I have to confess that for the first half-hour or so, I thought this movie would rely on clever, insider verbal gags. But once the characters took root, the ensemble started to click and the music started to flow, I finally relaxed and enjoyed the ride.<br /><br />Garrison Keillor is no actor. He is what he is, which is mainly a vehicle for other talented folk to strut their stuff. His show is wholesome with an edge. The movie retained that flavor, as well as some of the clean, uplifting fun that Keillor's fans have come to expect of him. Death and old-fashioned fun rub elbows in a weirdly comfortable way that generates sentiment but is too real to be maudlin. The only thing missing was Keillor's long dialogs about life in Lake Wobegon, whose name was never mentioned during the movie. Just as well - the dialogs would have interrupted the flow and made the movie about Keillor rather than his guests. Streep and Tomlin were perfect as a singing sister act. Harrelson and John C. Reilly were terrific as Lefty and Dusty, a couple of crude singing cowboys supposedly right off the range. Their extended song of horrible jokes was hilarious. Kline, ever the master of physical comedy, was comically inept as Noir. And even Lindsay Lohan was fairly masterful as Streep's nihilistic daughter Lola, whose notebooks were full of poems about suicide. Virginia Mersden was suitability grave and mysterious as "Dangerous Woman" whose presence meant peril for someone.<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure, but it certainly seemed as if everyone did their own singing. That added a great deal to the flavor and spirit of the show and of the movie. "A Prairie Home Companion" is a film with heart and soul, and successfully transfers the show's energy from radio to film. You will find yourself laughing and smiling and tapping your feet.

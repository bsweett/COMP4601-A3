<meta name="summary" content="Could Have Been Much Better"></head><body><p>Hackneyed vampire story with a script and directing that was predictable, disjointed and lacking in creative storytelling that, sadly,  was potentially possible in this unique juxtaposition of two misunderstood needy lovers. Opportunity missed! Instead we just get shallow personifications of characters such as parents, guardians, caretakers, professionals and teachers that are presented as incompetent expendable meals that have no more depth than a shadow. These people were given such small stereotypic roles that we seem to care little whether they die or do nothing all film long. Just not real! The rest of the unreality of this film was the heavy reliance upon ripping people apart which, again, did nothing to advance our understanding of our misunderstood protagonists.<br /><br />Two stars for the cinematography and Chlo?'s presence. Although, wasted in a movie where her talents were diminished by very fakey blood; CGI teeth; bare feet endlessly filmed (another reason why Americans need to wear sandals more often) and posing for the camera with "the look" punctuated by limited scripted lines that seemed almost tritely comical. She needs a new agent.<br /><br />You would think that a nearly 1000 year old 12 year old vampire would have experienced love at least once in that long life span. Also, you would think that raiding blood banks and hospital blood freezers would be a whole lot quicker and safer source of hemoglobin (you know - AIDS; other viruses and pathogens would be screened out). Also, what does a Rubik's cube have to do with innately primitive blood hunting savagery - there's  just not a whole lot of abstract creative intelligence transfer between the two activities.<br /><br />Conclusion: Just a poorly thought out and directed script.</p></body></html>

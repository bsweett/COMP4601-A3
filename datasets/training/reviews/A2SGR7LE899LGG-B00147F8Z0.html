The movie plots between the predator and the humans is somewhat disjointed and never quite reaches a synergetic staus. The storyline struggles to maintain the viewer interested at times, but it fortunately never quite crosses the boreness threshold. Dialogue is standard and the movie feels somewhat campy sometimes, but again barely so. Besides all the shortcomings mentioned above, I must say that I enjoyed the movie quite a bit. It is entertaining and it kept me at the edge of my seat. Aliens are still as nasty and frightening as I remember them from all the previous movies and their appeal is still high at least in my book (same goes for the predator!). Overall: VERY GOOD!</p></body></html>

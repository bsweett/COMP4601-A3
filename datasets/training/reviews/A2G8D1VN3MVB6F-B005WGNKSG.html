<meta name="summary" content="Better than the Craig version"></head><body><p>This is the swedish version of a cinematic interpretation of a great swedish thriller. The book is fantastic, but cerebral. This version reflects that by not relying upon sound effects and other tricks to make the story hit you in the gut. Rather, this one does it simply be catching the creepy nature of the story through acting and how the film is shot. The imagery does a great job of sharing a mood that stresses the loss felt by one character, and that is as clear as the author of the book intended it to be. This is great because it prevents the story from being caught up in over the top imagery and Hollywood tricks. All in all, the best version of this movie.</p></body></html>

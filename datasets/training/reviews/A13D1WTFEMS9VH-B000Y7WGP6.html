Not only that, the constant jerking around of the camera gives you motion sickness. (That's defintely one modern fimmaking technique I can do without; reminds me of how an amateur would handle a camera rather than imparting some sort of gritty, "real" feel). Then there's the half-baked story. A total insult to your intelligence. In summary: No characters worth mentioning, idiotic story and overuse of film "technique" to try to make up for it. The movie fails on all counts. Bad, bad, bad!</p></body></html>

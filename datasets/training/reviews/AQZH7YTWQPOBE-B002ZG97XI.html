<meta name="summary" content="Back to the Future meets Hangover"></head><body><p>At first glance, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG97XS">Hot Tub Time Machine (Unrated) [Blu-ray</a>] seems like a mix between <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00198X0UO">Back to the Future: 25th Anniversary Trilogy (+ Digital Copy) [Blu-ray</a>] and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Q4VBPQ">The Hangover (R-Rated Single-Disc Edition)</a>. It had the potential to be a really funny movie, particularly the speculation about when the bellboy loses his arm. Unfortunately, the constant cursing (especially f-bombs), unsubtle sex scenes, and simply disgusting moments really ruin the film. I don't mind some of this stuff, but too much and done in poor taste comes across as amateurish and boorish rather than funny. The characters' reactions to much of the movie's events are so blatantly unrealistic and stupid as to make it look pathetic. I'd like to see somebody take this concept and plot and do a decent, tasteful version of it. For now, I'll give it 2.5 stars.</p></body></html>

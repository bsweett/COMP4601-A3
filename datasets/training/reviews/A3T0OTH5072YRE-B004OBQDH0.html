<meta name="summary" content="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1"></head><body><p>I've read all the books, seen all the movies (to date) and this one was good but definitely not the best of them.  I do have to confess that its been awhile since I read the book, but I was scratching my head through part of this movie trying to figure out where some of the scenes came from.  Whether this is from faulty memory or drastic changes from the book, I'm not quite sure.<br /><br />For those who are unfamiliar with the Harry Potter series, they should be read/watched in sequence without skipping around.  To do otherwise is to miss out on a lot of important plot details.  Its also important to note that the books have vastly more detail and help explain some things the movies do not so I recommend reading the books to help fill some of these holes in the movies.<br /><br />Harry Potter had lived with his aunt and uncle and their spoiled son when one day he discovers he is a wizard and can attend the magical school of Hogwarts.  Harry has a sad past though, his parents were killed by an evil wizard and throughout the books, that wizard keeps trying to come back and kill Harry.  This wizard, Voldemort, has finally regained power and taken over the world.  Harry, and his two friends Hermione and Ron set out to find the last of the Horcruxes, talismen that hold a part of Voldemort's soul and are the key to killing him once and for all.  Their journey is not easy, and they are pursued at every step, betrayed, and even injured.  In addition to this, they have to cope with their feelings for each other and maintain their friendship.<br /><br />Since it only covers half of the book, this movie largely focuses on Harry and the gang trying to find some of the horcruxes without going into any real battle.  There are a couple squirmishes so fighting is not totally ruled out in this movie.  The fighting can be brutal and may scare some younger viewers.  Some of the characters are just plain creepy as well.  Bellatrix especially, she gives me shivers.<br /><br />Ron really took a shining role in this movie.  He was witty and showed a wide range of emotion.  Hermione of course was her perfect self, but even she was allowed to fly off the handle a bit.  Harry was stoic and set upon his task, but I do think they could have given him a few more bits of happiness in the movie than they did.  Comic relief was far and few between in this dark movie.  Which is not necessarily bad, but could make the movie a bit heavy for some viewers.  The rest of the characters were all played well and very believable.  Its nice that they really tried to find the perfect person for each part and it makes the movie that much more relatable to the books.<br /><br />My only complaints with the movie are that some of the scenes were longer than necessary.  I realize character development is important, but after awhile, watching them trudge around with their tent got a little boring and I would have liked to see the pace pick up a bit or even some of those scenes cut.  Yes, the book may have had that as well, but movie going is a very different animal than book reading, and some things should be changed to reflect that.  In addition, I was also a bit disappointed they cut out the devlopment of Kreacher in the movie when he played such a huge role in the book.  It seems to me they could have had more of that and less of tent trudging.<br /><br />For the more technical aspects of the movie, the special effects and cinematography were great.  Even better than the previous movies in my opinion. I especially loved the tree outside the Lovegood's home. The music is always wonderful and really fit with the tone of the movie.<br /><br />It was a wonderful movie though and mostly faithful to the book.  I would take a guess that any fan of Harry Potter will probably enjoy this movie.  Now I just have to wait for the much anticipated finale.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2010</p></body></html>

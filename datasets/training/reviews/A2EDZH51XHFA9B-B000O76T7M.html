Anderson, 2004)<br /><br />I've been a fan of the Alien movies for almost twenty-five years, and a fan of the Predator movies for almost fifteen. (Yes, I even liked Predator 2 and Alien 3.) So honestly, I walked into this movie expecting to loathe it, even though Paul W. S. Anderson was responsible for Resident Evil, one of the few videogames-made-movies worth watching.<br /><br />But first, a few words on one of the strangest theatergoing experiences I have ever had. I was in Akron, OH, this weekend, and went to see the movie while my wife was in class. So I was somewhat out of my usual sphere of cinemas, and went instead to the closest place to where we were, a Regal Cinemas outpost just off Rt. 77 in Fairlawn, OH.<br /><br />While the floor wasn't littered with trash or anything, "dirty" was the word that kept coming to mind. There was just something inexpressibly grimy about the place that kept me from feeling comfortable at all. This could well be because I'm used to the insanely-well-kept Cinemark in Valley View, which is pretty much the king of theaters, but there you go. Add to that the insane matinee price (I've paid less than the matinee price at Regal for evening shows at some theaters within the past year) and the insane drink price-forget popcorn (six bucks a tub!)--and I was set to hate Alien vs. predator even more, because it gypped me out of eight bucks more than it should have had I gone to see it at Cinemark (and let's not forget Cinemark has free refills on popcorn, making back-to-back moviegoing such a pleasant experience).<br /><br />Then I got into the theater about twenty minutes early, and instead of the usual projection of still-frame trivia and the like, I walked in on a short promo piece about both the upcoming special-edition DVD of Resident Evil and the upcoming film Resident Evil: Apocalypse. It was followed up (with, of course, commercials in between everything) with short features about other stuff, like the new animated NBC series Father of the Pride. This, folks, is what we should be doing with our time twenty minutes before a movie, not trying to unscramble such difficult-to-fathom-when-scrambled names as Ali Larter. Sheesh. Cinemark, most everything you do right, but this is one place where dingy, dark Regal outscores you big-time.<br /><br />(Also, a trailer for Paparazzi, the first picture from the mighty Icon since The Passion of the Christ, and my, my, does it look fine.)<br /><br />But now. Aliens. Predators. A slew of good reviews from critics and a cadre of fans over at IMDB who have trashed it right into the ground. Basically, they're saying all the things I thought I would. But I'm not going to.<br /><br />Sanaa Lathan (Love and Basketball, Life) is Lex, basically a Sherpa guide who happens to come from somewhere in America. She, along with a bunch of other folks, is approached by Maxwell Stafford (Resident Evil's Colin Salmon), a rather twee representative of Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen), the ancestor, if you will, of the AP in Aliens and the Weyland character in Alien 3 (both also played by Henriksen). One of Weyland's satellites has discovered some kind of heat signature over a small remote island off the coast of Antartica; judging from the walls, it's a pyramid, two thousand feet below the ice. Everyone is rather excited; this could be a major archaeological find, and Weyland and co. want to be the first ones there (over Lex's objections, since no one in the party is trained for this sort of thing). But you can probably tell by the title of the movie that archaeology is not what will be going on in this movie. And as soon as you see the pyramid, you will know the what, the who, and the when (as in, during the next hour and change of film). The how and the why will be explained to you, don't worry.<br /><br />Anderson here does a fine job of keeping with the parallel structures of both franchises (you don't actually see a monster for a while, letting tension build), except there's not much tension to build. Anderson has made the mistake that both Richard Donner and John McTiernan avoided: he's simply got too many characters running around to give us enough empathy with them in the space of forty-five minutes or so before the action begins. A possible budding romance between Lex and the team's chemical engineer, Graeme (Julien Donkey-Boy's Ewen Bremner) wanders off the face of the movie, never to be seen again; an opening shot featuring an archaeologist (Under the Tuscan Sun's Raoul Bova) ends up being a shaggy-dog joke; some of the characters are never introduced to us at all before the team is assembled, so we know very little about them except, if you're paying very close attention, their names (and in one case, what a character does; the rest seem to be there to provide predators with appetizers before they move on to the main course of Raw Scientist). And despite Anderson's beliefs as stated in the AvP special shown on Fox last week, Sanaa Lathan's character ain't no Ripley, by any stretch of the imagination. Lathan is a fine actress, but she has massive boots to fill, and I'm not sure anyone could have done it.<br /><br />So, all that said, why was I so awed by the spectacle that was Alien vs. Predator? Simple: the special effects.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of special effects. I'm the guy who didn't even notice bullet-time in The Matrix, and had no idea what people were talking about until I saw The Art of War (on video!). But every once in a while, a movie pops up with special effects so brilliant, and so well-integrated into the scenes, that you cannot help but sit there, jaw agape, at how well they fit everything together. One scene in particular is so well-rendered that I actually wished Elias Merhige would have directed this picture, because he would have lingered on it longer.<br /><br />Of course, the movie does go over the top into SFX cheese territory a few times (the bullet-time facehuggers provoked a laugh from the audience, as I figured they would after seeing them in the TV promo special), but for the most part, Amalgamated Design, Inc., earned whatever they got paid for this film, and whatever it was, it wasn't enough.<br /><br />Even though I went into this movie with high hopes, I realized about halfway through (while I was formulating that too-many-characters bit in my head) that I wasn't going in expecting Alien or Predator; I'd have had to be nuts to think I was going to get a film with that level of expertise from Paul W. S. Anderson, who's a fun director, but not a creator of deathless art. Once I allowed myself to think the film was going to be brainlessly entertaining, that's exactly what I got. The little in-jokes were fantastic, and some surprisingly subtle (did you catch the homage to an earlier franchise film with Lex and the bottlecap?), the action was fun, the effects were monstrous. One thing I did wonder, though-- why were all the aliens so little? Though, granted, the time frames in this movie were stretching anything remotely resembling reality, the original Alien burst out of John Hurt's chest and grew to full size in an exceptionally short period of time (remember that Ripley, in Aliens, puts the timeframe of the original movie at "less than twenty-four hours" when addressing the soldiers), so it's not like these guys take a long time to grow up. And has anyone noticed how, with each successive movie, the gestation time of an alien, once it reaches its human host, has gotten shorter and shorter?<br /><br />Still, despite all the nits to pick, Alien vs. Predator is the kind of effects extravaganza that's going to appeal to a goodly portion of the masses. And, for some reason I can't understand, this time I'm one of the masses it appeals to. *** ?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A primer for the everyday hero"></head><body><p>Ah, the dreaded ?sophomore project?.  Director M. Night Shyamalan?s second big feature film had me hoping for the best but fearing that the typical pattern would prove true with Unbreakable.  This time the director explores the transcultural hero mythos, which according to the film?s logic is preserved in our modern culture through comic book stories.<br /><br />David Dunn is a security guard with a wife and kid in a big city.  He seems quite ordinary, and probably never would have suspected the truth about himself until a key event changed his life forever:  he survived a devastating train wreck.  In fact, he was the only survivor, unscathed.  There is no logical explanation for how he escaped a mutilating death, and from that point on he is on a mission to track down the answer to Why.  In the process, he meets a rare comic book dealer who explains the universal structure of the guardian/hero archetype told through stories around the world:<br /><br />Heroes ? appears ordinary to the world, but cannot be killed by ordinary means, exceptionally strong; life?s work is to protect the weak and innocent of his time.<br /><br />Villains ? opposite of the hero, but often very close to him, best friends even; life?s purpose is destruction and/or domination. It becomes clear that David was indeed born to be a hero ? but then, who is his opposite terrorizing the city anonymously?<br /><br />I though Unbreakable was a nicely shot in a moody, Film Noir style.  Solid performance by Bruce Willis, who is so very well-cast as an Everyman type who wakes up one day to realize who he really was all his life.  Samuel L. Jackson is his unforgettable counterpart Elijah, the comic bookstore owner -- superbly played. Just slightly slow pacing drags the plot a bit in places, but it is redeemed by a nice twist or two.  I would say that overall, this was a much better-than-average sophomore project for M. Night.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of the dark and speculative genre.<br /><br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></body></html>

Jack Nicholson won his first Oscar for this movie, this is his best role to date. Nicholson brings depth and vulgarity to his role, he knows how to balance between with ease and talent. Louise Fletcher plays Nurse Ratchett, I'll just say she is not a sweetheart, she plays a character that most people won't like but she's fabulous in this drama. I highly recommend watching this beloved classic, enjoy!</p></body></html>

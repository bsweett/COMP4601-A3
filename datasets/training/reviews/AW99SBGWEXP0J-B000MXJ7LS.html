<meta name="summary" content="World Trade Center"></head><body><p>"World Trade Center" is the true story of police officers John McLoughlin (Cage) and Will Jimeno (Pe&ntilde;a), who were trapped on the concourse between the North and South Towers, beneath the rubble when the Towers came down.  The movie follows them from early morning on 9/11/2001 to their rescue.  While trapped, they must rely on each other to survive long enough to be found.  A friendship forms in the most awful of places, and neither would have probably survived if it wasn't for the other.  It is also the story of their wives, Donna (Bello) and Allison (Gyllenhaal), and how they had to deal with not knowing what had happened to their husbands.<br /><br />"World Trade Center" is almost as good as "United 93", the other 9/11 movie from this year.  It has been made tastefully, and shows heroism in a terrible time of national crisis.  Cage and Pe&ntilde;a do good jobs as the two leads, spending most of their time under rubble where only there faces are shown.  They make these people real.  Oliver Stone's direction is good, and he makes the story very compelling.  This, along with "United 93" is one of the must see movies of the year.  I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

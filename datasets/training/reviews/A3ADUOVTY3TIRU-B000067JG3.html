<meta name="summary" content="good movie"></head><body><p>This is a definite all time classic.I think what realy makes this movie the classic that it is,is the very good script and fine acting by all the characters.I'm going to hate to say it but the music in this movie,isnt all my cup of tea.While its kind of ok,some of it never realy hit the spot with me.I enjoy watching the actual movie,and they just happen to be in a bad place when war is breaking out.It must have been awful for so many peoples dreams to be destroyed by war.They are in the thick of it as they try to escape the wrath of the German army.</p></body></html>

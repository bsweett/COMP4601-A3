In my personal world of cinema, the French are mostly known for crafting films with leanings toward the artsy-fartsy, but, you know, every now and then, they do eschew the lofty, artistic pretenses and simply bust out with a no-nonsense, cut to the chase kind of movie. And that's what I thought we had initially when I started watching HIGH TENSION. But, alas, as it turns out, this movie does end up being true to its innate Frenchness as, amidst all the gory slaughter, it does provide its own set of symbolisms, and so, in that sense, it is arty. But not enough to hamper my enjoyment of what is predominantly a bloodily direct, point A to point B, slasher horrorfest.<br /><br />HIGH TENSION, as co-written and helmed by French director by Alexandre Ada, is damned harrowing and moves at a driving clip. In Ada's own words, HIGH TENSION was "conceived as an ode to the 1970s American horror/slasher films (he) loved as a teenager." As such, this latest offering in the slasher genre is deliberately reduced to its bare essentials. HIGH TENSION is a film that is spare, visceral, single-minded, and it definitely pulls no punches. If you're a gorehound of any quality, you'll think it's terrific stuff.<br /><br />The premise is simple and straightforward, involving two girls' frenzied and nightmarish bid for survival against a frightening, homicidal maniac intent on butchering them. The majority of the movie consists of Marie (Cecile de France) determinedly pursuing the murderous lunatic in the workman's outfit who had already massacred the inhabitants of the country home in which she was staying and who had also kidnapped Marie's best friend, Alex (Maiwenn).<br /><br />Now, this paragraph, in part, concerns the movie's climax and does contain serious SPOILERS. With regards to the "twist" ending, this stabhappy feature is somewhat reminiscent of IDENTITY and Agatha Christie's WHO MURDERED ROGER ACKROYD? If you've seen that film or read that book, then you already know what the surprise ending here is. There are clues and hints put out there in the course of the film that do seem to point towards the shocking revelation, but they are so subtle and seemingly non-sequitur as to become virtually negligible. No wonder several viewers are confused and even feel cheated. There is a tendency to feel that the surprise reveal does come out of left field. Myself, I didn't see it coming. I had to watch it twice, with the second screening being devoted solely to ferreting out clues and hidden meanings. For example, only after my second viewing does the early scene - of the nutso killer performing masturbation via the decapitated head of a girl (who resembles Alex) - begin to take on deeper symbology, rather than being merely a scene reflecting the killer's depravity, which was what I thought it was about, originally. There's also a clue-divulging scene involving one character who indulges in a "self-treat" after glimpsing a nude Alex thru a window.<br /><br />But, nevermind all that. Yes, there are inconsistencies in the film, but the aura of unrelenting tension and stark desperation serves to carry the story and camouflage the flaws, at least, until the the big reveal. The intense, if one-note, acting of lead actress Cecile de France and the acute terror displayed by Maiwenn go a ways to accentuate the horror aspect. However, Philippe Nahon, who plays the killer, is ho-hum. Now, the version I saw was dubbed in English (with Cecile de France adeptly doing her own dubbing honors) and I feel the translation did take a miniscule something away from the movie; whenever I get a chance, providing it's sub-titled, I prefer watching a foreign film in its original state.<br /><br />So, let me encapsulate: HIGH TENSION is no frills and gorily no-holds-barred; it's more of a psychological thriller than you might think. Compared to some recent and even not so recent derivative efforts in the horror/slasher genre (the remakes of WHEN A STRANGER CALLS or BLACK CHRISTMAS, anyone?), HIGH TENSION is decidedly a cut above (sorry). So, add this one to the more diverting dice 'em, slice 'em flicks, such as SCREAM, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS, and the SAW series, although as I was watching it, the one film that kept popping up in my noggin was Rutger Hauer's THE HITCHER. As I recall, THE HITCHER, too, shared the same inexorable pace and the same debilitating (from the protagonist's point of view) sense of "Oh, crap, this a**hole's gonna be fairly impossible to stop." Three and a half stars.</p></body></html>

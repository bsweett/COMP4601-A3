<meta name="summary" content="Thrilling and Very Tense"></head><body><p>One of the biggest box office smashes of the '90s, &quot;The Fugitive&quot; still firmly holds its ground as a thinking persons' action film, full of exciting story (based on the television show and the Alan Shepard murder case) and fine kinetic filmaking.  And who doesn't love Tommy Lee Jones (The Client, Men In Black) Harrison Ford (If you don't know one other movie he's in stop reading this review) as adversaries and seeming equals.  Plus the film boasts an up-and-coming Joe Pantoliano (of t.v.'s &quot;The Sopranos&quot; the new CBS drama &quot;The Handler&quot;) as a member of Jones' crack U.S. Marshall unit.<p>The film kicks off as Dr. Richard Kimble (Ford) is wrongly convicted of his wifes' murder, and escapes when his prison bus crashes and is destroyed by an oncoming train.  Soon on the scene is veteran U.S. Marshall Samuel Gerrard (Jones) to start his relentless hunt for Kimble.<p>What follows is an intense cat and mouse game, with Jones dogging Fords' every step and Ford risking almost certain recapture trying to clear his name.  Gifted Director Andrew Davis and his gifted team of editors and cinematographers take this premise and turn &quot;The Fugitive&quot; into a virtuostic piece of kinetic filmaking.  They stage one surprising and no holds barred chase after another, trying to top themselves at every turn and succeeding most of the time. A huge reason for this is Ford and Jones, the films' soul.  Jones won a deserved Best Supporting Actor oscar for his work playing a terrific hard-ass, and no one is better at playing sympathetic heroes than Harrison Ford, and he pulls out one of his best performances.</p></body></html>

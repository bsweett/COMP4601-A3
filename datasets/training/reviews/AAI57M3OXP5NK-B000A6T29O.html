<meta name="summary" content="Worth A Watch"></head><body><p>This movie is worth the watch but not a good storyline at all because she could have destroyed that part of the triangle and it would have ended it right there but no they had to keep it going anyways it had okay special effects it looks worse on TV than it did in the movie theatres.  The DVD is okay but nothing spectacular.  this movie is worth a watch but i can't watch this movie after one time, it annoys me.</p></body></html>

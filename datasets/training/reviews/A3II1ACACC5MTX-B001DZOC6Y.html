What this about is a type of unusual hay fever where instead of suffering sneezing and runny eyes, sufferers jump off buildings and under lawnmowers and stuff. Yes, that's it.<br /><br />As ever, Walberg is so wooden in it, I'm surprised the plants didn't have him identified as a 5th Columnist, but he brings enough confusion and frowns to the show to not actually be too bad in this. I like the guy; he's a different kind of wooden to Keanu Reeves. It would be great to get them in the same film and have them chased by woodpeckers, termites and stuff, now that would be terrifying.<br /><br />I thought Zooey Deschamel was lovely and wonderful, a definite "keeper" in anyone's book, a Zooey Keeper in fact. Ho ho.<br /><br />Now I have got the puns out of the way, onto the film. The premise is ridiculous in the extreme, now, as a scientist, I am sure that there is much we don't know about plants, and yes, plants can produce chemicals to make them unattractive to potential predators, and yes, they can even communicate with other nearby plants of an attack to enable them to start producing the same chemical as well. This much is true. But the actual mechanism and effects themselves, it is just too silly. I am the first to recommend that in many cases, one should just put aside scientific realities for the sake of the film, but this just stretches it too far.<br /><br />If perhaps the chemical induced some sort of hallucinations or random psychotic behaviours, I would have gone for it a bit more. All the dramatic music and waving of grass in the breeze was just silly in the end I thought.<br /><br />Now, on to the direction. M Night Shyamalan is like a new test cricketer who started off with centuries in his first couple of matches, now; however, he is struggling to get the ball off the square. He just seems to have lost his touch and he really needs to get back to brass tacks, stop meddling too much and concentrate on getting the simple things right. There is no doubt that there are moments of tension in the film, but the overtly silliness of the plot means that you are never really fully drawn in.<br /><br />Mind you, I was never really enamoured with the director after seeing that preposterous "documentary" about him a few years back. Please tell me no one could be as self absorbed as that, please?<br /><br />And the ending, oh dear, again, lazy and contrived. Cut to the scene a few months after "The Happening" with the happy family walking down leafy streets full of plants. You can guarantee that if The Happening had actually Happened, there would have been a defoliation that would have made the whole Agent Orange thing look like a brisk whiff of "Roundup". Well, wouldn't you stamp on every blade of grass within a hundred miles if you thought the grass was going to rise up against you? Oh, just writing this made me realise the irony of the "lawnmower incident". Ho ho.<br /><br />Anyway, to summarise, could have been more, not a total waste of time though, 2 and a half stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A good well rounded drama"></head><body><p>I found 'The Descendants' to be quite interesting and touching with a nice performance by George Clooney.  It is somewhat of a family picture as well with no crazy car chases, gun fights or stuff like that.  My only complaint was at the end we were not exactly sure what he did with the land.  Appeared he kept it but then again I left the theatre with that question which I did not like since it really did not bring closure to the film.  Maybe I missed something but I never got bored during the movie so would be hard for me to think I did miss something.  Nonetheless, a very fine picture.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></body></html>

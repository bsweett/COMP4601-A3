<meta name="summary" content="Fugettaboutit -- the best crime movie ever made"></head><body><p>If my title seems like hyperbole, you obviously haven't seen this movie.  With all due respects to Mr. Coppola, &quot;Goodfelleas&quot; blows away even &quot;The Godfather.&quot;  Director Martin Scorsese, who grew up in  the same neighborhoods as the characters in his film, captures onscreen the  most creditble crime story ever told.  Unfolding over the course of three  decades, the movie tells the story of Henry Hill, a mid-level mobster who  only turned state's evidence against his fellows after he had no other  choice.  The movie is bursting with memorable characters; Joe Pesci as the  hotheaded mobster, Robert DiNiro as the cold blooded killer-thief, Paul  Sorvino as the head of the family.  If these guys don't put a chill through  you, nothing will.  This is the best movie from one of America's greatest  directors.</p></body></html>

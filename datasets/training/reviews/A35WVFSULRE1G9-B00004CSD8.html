I was 9 when I seen the original and it scared me to wits, the music, the death scenes, and Damian's sinister look. You can not get any better then Gregory Peck and Lee Remick. I just don't get it. The Fog was redone and so horrible that they didn't even give pre-screening to critics, they knew they had a turkey. The Texas Chainsaw remake, why? The original was way more creepier. Dawn of the Dead remake, zombies running at Carl Lewis speed, I thought they were dead? And now Rob Zombie is remaking the immortal Halloween, I think I will puke at that one. What next remake Jaws, The Godfather, or Caddyshack? Hollywood is so boring anymore. As for this film, yeah it works, if you haven't seen the original, but otherwise the best marketing gimmick was releasing it on 6/6/06. I also heard George Romeros Day of the Dead and the original Friday the 13th are being redone. God help us, remake a film that sucked, like Ishtar or Caddyshack 2.</p></body></html>

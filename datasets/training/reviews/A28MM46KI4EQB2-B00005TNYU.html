<meta name="summary" content="Great Collector's Set!"></head><body><p>This is among my list of all time favorites, and I would have to say that overall this is a pretty awesome collector's set for fans of this movie...the board game and story boards and little magazines & whatnot are all pretty neat little collectables.  Glad to have this set in my collection.<br /><br />I think the only one little gripe I would have to say is that I was sort of expecting a better copy of the Blu-Ray in this sset...maybe some kind of limited edition casing and/or inserts or something.  However, that's a small deal and this set is still pretty awesome!  My wife and I play a lot of board games, and we'll probably enjoy playing the board game together.  I waited to get this for a while because, let's be real, $50 in my opinion is a bit much to spend on a single movie, even a cool set like this.  However, waiting paid off because I wound up scoring it brand new down the road for only $30.  Not bad.<br /><br />If you're a big Goonies fan like I am, this is a really cool collector's set to own, and I would say it's worth it to add this beauty to your collection.  They have both DVD and Blu-Ray sets, whichever capabilities you happen to have.  This set is awesome!</p></body></html>

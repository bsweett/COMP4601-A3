They say it is a movie that made them remember what it is to be a kid again. That it is a movie of pure visual joy. An escapist movie that's main purpose is to please. I think they are over doing it with the hype of that movie, but, if you were to ask me what movie do I think should be described this way, I would respond with, "have you seen "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"?<br /><br /> Here is a movie that is endlessly creative. As I watched the movie I just sat back and relax while this whole new world unfolded before my eyes. I never questioned whether or not what I was seeing was possible or not because it didn't matter. "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" creates its own world. A world where anything is possible. Plus that's half the joy in watching a movie like this, or even the "Harry Potter" series. We can visit a place such as this. The world of make believe. That is what the movies are all about.<br /><br /> I've never been much of a fan of Tim Burton's work. I've always found his movies visually creative but too off beat for my taste. I have enjoyed "Ed Wood" and Edward Scissorhands" but everything else has left me cold. "Mars Attacks", "Beetlejuice" and the original "Batman" all have moments of visual splendor but no heart. But in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" I feel Burton has found the perfect blend. This is a movie where Burton can be as werid and creative as he wants because in this setting he can never really go overboard. Plus the movie has heart. He has found the perfect combination. That is why I think this is his best movie.<br /><br /> I've never read the book by Roald Dahl, which this film is based on, so I'm sorry to say I cannot comment on whether or not this movie is faithful or not. But, from what I've read from the critics supposedly this is. I have seen the 1971 film version with Gene Wilder though. I have always thought that movie was a bit creepy. I haven't seen the movie since I was a kid but I remember certain scenes actually being scary. At least to a wimp like me. I have heard though people say this movie is creepy. Roger Ebert complained that Johnny Depp's performance as Willy Wonka reminded him of Michael Jackson. I can sense why someone would say that, but I was never bothered by it. To be honest I was too busy being swept away by the film's visual to really care about his performance. But I never really found it creepy because again, in a movie like this you can never look at anything with a normal eye. The world created here cannot be compared to our normal existence.<br /><br /> If you honestly don't know what the movie is about it follows a young boy named Charlie (Freddie Highmore) who wins a golden ticket when he buys a bar of wonka chocolate. With the golden ticket he, along with four other children, will be able to go inside Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and discover how Wonka's candy is made.<br /><br /> Along the way though strange these start to happen to the children. Each "accident" is of course fitting to each child's personality. One child loves to eat chocolate for example, so of course it is the chocolate that gets him in the end. Another child is spoiled and it is because of her ways she meets her own fate. "She's a bad nut", Charlie says. In this sense I've always thought the movie was a moral parable warnng children not to behave badly. I could be wrong, but that's how I've always interrupted things.<br /><br /> The only thing in the movie I don't like were the songs sung by the Oompa Loompa's (all played by the same person, Deep Roy). To me they weren't as charming or memorable as the ones in the orginal. Though four of the five songs have lyrics written by Dahl.<br /><br /> In the end though this is a minor complaint. The real star of the movie is the visual details that make up this world. Anyone looking for an escape from reality should see this movie. "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was one of the most pleasurable viewing experiences I've had this year. Tim Burton hasn't just improved upon the original he has made his best film to date!<br /><br /> Bottom-line: An endlessly creative movie that creates a world where anything is possible. The real star of the movie is the visuals. This is Tim Burton's best movie!</p></body></html>

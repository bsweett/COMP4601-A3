In actuality, this movie is both the life story of Johnny Cash and the love story between him and June Carter.  The movie is solid with impeccable performances particularly by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.  In "behind the scene" feature, the Director himself commented that both performers exceeded his expectations and they managed to get their mannerisms spot-on.  What impresses me even more is the downright chemistry & effortless bond that those performers are able to convey of Johnny Cash and June Carter.  The movie has moments of flashback and it tracks down Johnny's gradual rise and downfall and his victory over his demon in a linear progression and along the way, we get to see Johnny's fascination with June since childhood, how their lives collided, how his persistency finally paid off in winning her heart over.  It's surreal to see his performances together with other prominent performers in the fifties such as Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis & Roy Orbinson.  Once again, in the special edition, the Director compiles individual performances of Johnny, June and the mentioned three performers into a jukebox sequences that can be enjoyed on its own merit.  The special edition also has interviews of Johnny's friends and relatives who talked about his faith, him as a person (and not simply a singer), the process of getting the real Johnny Cash and June Carter to approve of this movie (overall, it takes a decade to bring it into fruition) and also the making of Joaquin and Reese into the real stars.  A matured and heartfelt movie that's made with a lot of guts and love.  Mesmering to watch and highly recommended.</p></body></html>

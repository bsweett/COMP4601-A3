<meta name="summary" content="A Fine Movie For The Whole Family"></head><body><p>&quot;The Goonies&quot; is an entertaining movie that the whole family can watch together. It starts with a close-knit band of friends spending a last morning together. Their neighborhood is about to be demolished, scattering the families that inhabit it. When they discover an old pirate map, though, they decide to follow it in hopes of finding treasure and saving their homes. What follows is a fast-paced adventure with caverns, crooks, skeletons, booby-traps, and a old pirate ship. There is also a liberal sprinkling of funny lines to go with all the thrills and chills. <p>While this is a fine movie, and great fun to watch, it is not a long-lost Hollywood classic. It doesn't have the action of the Errol Flynn version of &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, the drama of Hitchcock's &quot;Rear Window&quot;, or the classic humor of &quot;Arsenic And Old Lace&quot;. All the five-star ratings here would suggest that this is a movie of classic proportions. It isn't. It's great fun, and I recommend it for family viewing. There's never a dull moment, and I believe most people will enjoy it. I do. I own a copy, already. Just don't expect too much.</p></body></html>

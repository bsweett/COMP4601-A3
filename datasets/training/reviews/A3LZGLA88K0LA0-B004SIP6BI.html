While it is a handsomely filmed and charming movie, only the manipulations of Miramax honchos forced its way into the Oscar elite.  Lasse Hallstrom infuses the film with luscious cinematography and a strong sense of romantic fantasy.  He also elicits some marvelous performances from his talented cast:  Juliette Binoche as the mysterious chocolatier; Alfred Molina as the self righteous and lonely mayor; Carrie Anne Moss as a charming widow who carries a torch for Molina and a heavy hand in relations with her son and mother (Judi Dench in a cranky but touching performance); Hugh O'Conor as a young impressionable cleric; Lena Olin as the abused wife of cafe owner Peter Stormare.  Johnny Depp has a smaller role as the romantic interest for Binoche, but one figures any actor could have played the role and Depp's rich talents are underused.  The still lovely Leslie Caron brings a touch of class in a small role as a grieving war widow.  Rachel Portman's score is lush and evocative, and while CHOCOLAT is lightweight fare, it's still a testament to Hallstrom and crew for their tight professionalism.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="the original mummy- only with Brendan Frasier and a hell of a lot more action"></head><body><p>The emotional equivalent of eating a MRE when you're starving to death- that is The Mummy.  Boris Karloff's "The Mummy" was remade in 2001 into The Mummy, starring Brendan Frasier. This is the sequel and is so much better than the original. The basic plot: some evil Arab dudes have resurrected Imhotep, chief royal advisor to long-gone Egyptian pharaoh Seti I, in order to power him up enough to take out a bad-ass known as the Scorpion King (played magnificently by The Rock)- and of course, Evie and her husband (Frasier) must kill either the Scorpion King or Imhotep to prevent the other from taking over the world. The DVD is definitely your best choice for this flick; the VHS and DVD contain the same movie but the DVD has much better quality visuals and a hell of a lot more special material. (Unfortunately, only the VHS version has the music video for "Forever May Not Be Long Enough" by Live [a song from the soundtrack and a perfect pick, in my opinion]). I leave you with these words spoken by Ardeth Bay (played finely by Oded Fehr), the family guardian: "My friend, there is a fine line between coincidence and faith." From a movie containing quite a bit of Christian material, this line is a perfect addition to an already great movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One Day in the Vietnam War"></head><body><p>Full Metal Jacket, 1987 film<br /><br />Young men are getting a recruit's haircut; this marks them. They are given a welcoming speech by the Gunnery Sergeant. This is not a recruiting film. [The language is raw, but sort of funny in an exaggerated way.] They are taught to distinguish their rifle from a gun (artillery). "Gomer Pyle" has problems. [I wonder if such training was used in World War One and Two?] Gunny uses peer pressure against "Pyle". He has a "bad dream"! The Marines are taught how to shoot accurately. They finish their training and graduate. Most will go to Vietnam. There is a dramatic scene in the head when Leonard disobeys orders. [How realistic is this?]<br /><br />They arrive in Vietnam and learn to communicate with the indigenous people and learn the culture. The correct phrase is "sweep and clear" not "search and destroy". There are two types of stories published. It is the Lunar New Year. The Marines shoot at the figures who are far away. Joker will be sent to cover the front. One man in a helicopter shoots at the people on the ground. They arrive at the combat zone and find dead civilians. Was that speech by the Colonel supposed to be funny? They meet some frontline troops. There is enemy action and casualties. They photograph the troops, who speak their lines. There is a scene that wouldn't be shown on the 7 o'clock news. The Marines patrol the ruins of a city to check the report. A booby trap claims a victim. The follow the map. Was there a mistake? The enemy shoots the point man to draw in those who want to rescue him. "Where's the sniper?" Did one man stand in an exposed position? The Marines are able to neutralize the sniper. This scene is drawn out for dramatic effect and commentary on combat. What song do they sing as a final comment?<br /><br />The credits roll, the cast is shown in tiny type. "Filmed on location." The story was not designed to be a popular success. So who put up the funds for it? Was it designed to be a loss to offset profits from other successful investments? Oliver Stone's "Platoon" is still the best movie on the war on Vietnam. This is based on Gustav Hasford's novel "The Short-Timers". The first part of the film shows the psychological conditioning of recruits. Do they get any reconditioning before they are returned to civilian life? I wonder if anyone realized that forty years later America would be shipping factories to Vietnam and China?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Still scary in the silver anniversary"></head><body><p>The movie that spawned the term "blockbuster"! Bruce the Shark continues to thrill after a quarter century. Who can forget the opening, with John Williams' chilling score (which generations still hum at grim moments in life), the immortal lines "we're gonna need a bigger boat," Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw singing despite being scared to death, Robert Shaw's immortal monologue about the sinking of the Indianapolis (which inspired a young viewer to try to get a pardon for the Indianapolis' scapegoat captain)....the gore, the great moment when Brody blasts the beast to kingdom come. If you remember being ten and afraid to take a bath (yeah, fruity admits it) then this great collection, with its added attractions, isn't one to miss.</p></body></html>

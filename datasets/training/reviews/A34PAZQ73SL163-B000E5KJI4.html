<meta name="summary" content="Homer Gets Colorized."></head><body><p>"May the gods keep the wolves in the hills and the women in our beds." Thus spoke Agamemnon at the start of this film, yet his words are strangely applicable to all men regardless of the age in which they were born. The same can be said of the epics of Homer. The working title of this film was The Illiad, but there are some major departures between the landmark of literature and the script from which the movie was made. Without the gods as characters, a great deal of the story loses its meaning. Furthermore, a "war, what is it good for?" angle has been introduced and instilled within the characters. In my humble opinion, such a stance concerning battles and death is strikingly misguided in relation to those who lived in the classical world. Sons and husbands dying was a daily occurrence, and many of the conversations in this movie are more reflective of twentieth century therapism than anything to do with the Greeks or Trojans.<br /><br />However, despite one's historical objections to the interjections made by the characters in the name of our times, Troy is a very entertaining movie. Its 2+ hours float by, and I can't recall a film that was so pretty. That sounds condescending but it isn't. Its colors are vivid, and the views engaging. It pleases regardless of how disjointed the narrative may be. As for Brad Pitt as Achilles, if you ask me, he is the best part of the movie. I know some people won't buy him in such a role, but I was quite impressed. He won his acting bona fides with me years ago in Kalifornia and stood out in Snatch as well. Additionally, I thought Sean Bean as Odysseus was outstanding.</p></body></html>

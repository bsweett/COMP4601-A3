<meta name="summary" content="Jack Black Delivers the Performance of His LIfe!"></head><body><p>Jack Black is awesome in this movie.  I didn't think he would act in a better movie than Shallow Hal, but boy was I wrong!  Not only does he beat that performance, he beats it ten-fold.<p>I loved everything about this movie:<p>The plot - Rock and Roll freak kicked out of his band an needing rent money, and a way to get back into a &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot; contest, happens upon the chance to earn cash posing as his roommate and begins teaching at a private school.<p>The FUN - A cast of great kids combined with an amazing script.<p>The background - A school where kids aren't allowed to be kids.<p>The Message - Chasing your dream is NOT a waste of time.  In fact, doing so, can make time stand still...if only for a moment.  I just thought that up, pretty good huh?<p>G.B.<br />www.therunninggirl.com</p></body></html>

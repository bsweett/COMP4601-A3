<meta name="summary" content="A good sport wins again"></head><body><p>The good sport--that's me, dragging my feet initially when my wife suggested seeing this movie, and I had something else in mind.  Finally I decided to be a good sport and you know something, sometimes karma wins.  For THE INCREDIBLES turned out to be one of the best movies of the year, and I wasn't alone in laughing, hollering, screaming, and hooting at the "incredible" action on the screen.  It's not only fun, it's smart as hell, and in our part of the theater there was not a kid to be seen so all you adults out there, you don't have to purloin a kid to come in and see the show, it's perfectly permissible to go just as you are, grown up and unencumbered.<br /><br />You might enjoy yourself even more than the kids, for the pic is slanted towards the adult viewer who might be a wee bit beyond the initial springtime of youth, and who might be regretting growing up and putting away the "things of the child," as the Bible says.  "Who says you can't have your cake and eat it too, darling?" sighs Edna Mode, the tiny, huge-spectacled couteriere as she saunters through her Julius Shulman mansion.  Right on, Edna!</p></body></html>

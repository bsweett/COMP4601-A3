<meta name="summary" content="The Breakfast Club"></head><body><p>Out of all of the BRAT PACK movies, this was one of my favorites. The Breakfast Club is about 5 kids (an athlete, a princess, a nerd, a basket case and a criminal) who are stuck wasting a Saturday for their various reasons. In one Saturday, they all learn something new from each other and also learn a little about themselves.<p>O.k. first and foremost, the premis of this movie is kinda off (i.e. why are 5 kids actually showing up to Saturday detention?) but if you look past that little part, the rest of the movie is funny as hell. There's just a ton of laughs in this from wise cracks to even some pretty good physical comedy and even a smoking pot scene that's really funny.<p>I took off a star because Molly Ringwald's character (Claire) is a bit on the annoying side but at least, Judd Nelson is harsh in this movie! And of course Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall and Ally Sheedy weren't bad either.<p>This is a great hang out film and it's also a bit mooshy at the end for any romantics. Check this one out and also check out FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH.</p></body></html>

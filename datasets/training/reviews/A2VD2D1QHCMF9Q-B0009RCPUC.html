<meta name="summary" content="An Apologist's Tome"></head><body><p>This German film is an apologist's tome.  Hitler is portrayed as tottering, perhaps falling into a type of insanity.  He refuses to believe that there are no more troops, relates his failures in the war to the cowardice of the German people instead of to his own failings, seems to take pride in his lack of education compared to that of the Officer corps, and so on.  By portraying him as sick, one can say that this is not a moral lapse but a physiological one, and that is the problem here.<br /><br />Goebbels and some of the others are painted with the brush of pure evil, but the film's treatment of Hitler has no such clarity.  With his gentle treatment of his beloved dog (until the end of the movie) and his relationship to his secretary, and to the Goebbels' children, and to some others, the film is trying to emphasize a certain humanity in Hitler.  But what's the point.<br /><br />The film appeared to try to lighten the load of this conflict from the point of view of the German people.  It tried to say that Hitler was at heart a compassionate man, and when he did go off the deep end, it was his demons, not his will.  It attempts to lighten the true nature of evil, and that is just plain wrong.</p></body></html>

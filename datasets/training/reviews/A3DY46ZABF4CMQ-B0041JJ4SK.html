Kumar is an outgoing genius in the medical field, but does not want to pursue a career as a doctor just because his father and brother, and every other typecasted Indian, are doctors. The one thing these two guys have in common besides living in the same apartment is their love of smoking weed.<br /><br />On one particular night in which the movie takes place, they both get the munchies after a 'joint' session as they begin craving for White Castle after watching the commercial on TV. And that's where the real fun begins. Harold and Kumar face one obstacle after another on their way to the restaurant including a raccoon, a cheetah, a group of palookas who keep on bullying them, a stoned Neil Patrick Harris stealing their car, a long haired freak and his sexy wife, and the cops.<br /><br />Harold and Kumar are the Cheech and Chong of our time. With that said, be sure to see more Harold And Kumar films in the near future, something I'll be waiting for impatiently.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B+</p></body></html>

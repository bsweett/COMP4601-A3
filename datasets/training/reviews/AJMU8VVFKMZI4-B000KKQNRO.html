The Da Vinci Code is such a thinking thriller that it's nearly impossible to really capture on film.  I like Hanks, but I do have to agree with the critics on this one, he was absolutely boring as Robert Langdon.  The screenplay adaption absolutely doesn't make sense because when the film is over you're thinking-why didn't Teabing just leave the monk in France and just go on the adventure with his friends.  They trusted him at the time and were committed to solving the riddles.  Freeing the monk and the subsequent shoot out and chasing suddenly doesn't make any sense-since we're approaching this from a scholarly position.  The thing about The Da Vinci Code, it's sort of a one trick pony,  Once you know the secret it's sort of hard to then watch it and be pulled into the chase a second time.  (Indian Jones-it's not)  But The Da Vinci Code made too much money for it to be ignored by Hollywood and Howard's version may be as close to transforming the thinking thriller as anyone is going to get.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Oscar Worthy Film"></head><body><p>The script for "First Blood" was floating around Hollywood for some time before director Ted Kotcheff signed on to direct the film and Stallone signed on to star in and do the screenplay. Part of what makes "First Blood" so great is the political realness of it. The way that Rambo was treated is the way a lot of other Vietnam vets were treated when they returned home.<br /><br />"First Blood" is about Vietnam vet John Rambo. The film starts out were we see Rambo walking down a road, to find Delmare Berry. He is the last living member of the team that he served together on in Vietnam. Rambo learns that Delmare was killed by agent orange cancer. Having no where else to go, Rambo wonders into a small town called Hope. The Sheriff named Teasle stops him and offers him a ride to the edge of town. Teasle tells Rambo he does not want drifters in his town. Teasle drops Rambo off at the South end of Town and while he drives away, he sees Rambo walking back into Town. This causes Rambo to get arrested. While in the police station, Rambo has flashbacks to his torture in Vietnam which causes him to escape. With the help of Rambo's Colonel from Vietnam, Teasle is on the hunt for Rambo.<br /><br />The acting in "First Blood" is Oscar worthy. Sylvester Stallone playing John Rambo, does a wonderful job. There is not a whole lot of dialogue for Stallone in this film, but he makes it work. Also, with his breakdown at the end, which is incredible goes a long way and is personally relatable to Vietnam veterans.<br />Also, Brian Dennehy who plays Sheriff Teasle, does a great job. His character is an overweight, but tough cop. He never gives up on the search for Rambo, even when the higher authorities come in.<br />The character  Colonel Sam Trautman played by Richard Crenna is a noteworthy performance. Trautman is not directly involved in the search for Rambo, however since Rambo has no family or friends, Trautman is the only person he can trust.<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone will always be remembered for his "Rambo" and "Rocky" films. However, "First Blood" is Stallone's best individual film.<br />Finally, "First Blood" is not solely an action film, it is a mix between action and drama.</p></body></html>

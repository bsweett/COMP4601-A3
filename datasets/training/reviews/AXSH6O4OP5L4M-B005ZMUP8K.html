Furthermore the story line seemed rather thin.  While it brought up a lot of questions regarding personal agendas and conflict of interests, it also seemed to go on forever without purpose.  It seemed as though "adventures" were added ad infinitum until the movie was "long enough" at which point it was brought to a d&eacute;nouement.  It seemed that manic hijinx for its own sake should carry the film.  After a repeat of a marginally funny uncontrolled roll down a hill into water, I felt that even the insanity was too staged.<br /><br />What really put me off, though, was that the d&eacute;nouement had "to be continued" written all over it, which suggested a far greater desire to milk financial gain from a popular first film than for the entertainment of the audience.  It was very formulaic, sort of A + B + C = movie--or more properly $.  A definite disappointment.<br /><br />I also ended up feeling sympathetic with no one.  Well, perhaps a little with Jack.  Though he is his usual reprehensible but charming self, he was never less than honest about whom or what he was, so he seemed less objectionable!  More than anything, I felt this film had less of the light hearted insanity of the earlier film.  Despite the impressive CGI and the constant bedlam, it seemed a much darker work.  Again there was a sense that "more was to come," and indeed it almost guaranteed that the viewer would return to have his sense of balance restored, which seemed manipulative.  I chose not to purchase or attend the film until after the third was available.  One could only hope that by the next film the series itself would be redeemed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another boring mystery movie.."></head><body><p>Let's not have anymore of this kind of so called mystery movies! Wicker Man will give you a very hard time trying to stay focused as hardly any  exciting events take place. Could this movie by any chance secretly be another M. Night Shalyman movie? The way the story is being told reminded me of the Village, that other boring creepy story. Nicholas Cage stars once again as a police officer who needs to investigate the disappearance of a little girl and ends up in a place that is dominated by women. Without giving away the plot it is fair to inform you, that Cage boring performance is illustrating the lack of credibility of The Wicker Man.<br /><br />He looks just as if he already realizes, that this movie, will not interest anyone.(SARR)</p></body></html>

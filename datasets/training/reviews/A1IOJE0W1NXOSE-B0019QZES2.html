<meta name="summary" content="Sequel to "Meet the Parents""></head><body><p>Now that Gaylord Focker has met his in-laws, he must introduce them to his parents, the touchy-feely, let-it-all-hang-out duo played by Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman.  She is a sex therapist and he is a stay-at-home dad, in contrast to Gaylord's in-laws, the former CIA straight arrow (Robert DeNiro) and his long-suffering wife (Blythe Danner).  There is potential for humor here, but unfortunately the movie-makers go to the lowest common denominator and choose to saturate the film with tasteless sexual innuendoes and bathroom humor.  There are a few funny moments, but unfortunately they come all too seldom in this star-studded flop of a movie.  Take my advice, and skip this one.</p></body></html>

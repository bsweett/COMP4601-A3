The movie stars Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep.  It was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and Nicole Kidman won for Best Actress.  Also nominated were Julianne Moore and Ed Harris for their supporting roles.  It was nominated for Best Picture and Best Director.  This is a film with a high class pedigree.  <p>This film follows three women in three different time periods.  In the end, The Hours is really telling just one story and each of the time periods contributes to it.  We have Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) in 1923 England, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) in 1951 California, and Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) in 2001 New York.  The film does not have a story so much as it deals with issues revolving around the lives of these women: depression, suicide, death, and family.  The Hours does so in a way that is deeply personal but never pushes any viewpoint down the viewer's throat.  <p>Virginia Woolf is dealing with her personal issues of mental isolation as she writes Mrs. Dalloway.  She deals with depression and a desire to die to silence the voices in her head.  Laura Brown is a housewife who has to deal with a faltering relationship with her husband and she feels a kinship with the character of Mrs Dalloway in Woolf's novel (which she is reading).  Clarissa Vaughn is living in New York City, and it seems that she is living the life of Mrs Dalloway.  The movie features supporting performances by John C Reilly, Ed Harris, Claire Danes, Alison Janney, Miranda Richardson, Toni Collette, and Stephen Dillane.  <p>This is the type of film that is made for the Academy Awards but really only has a specialized audience outside the Award circuit.  Critics love The Hours, but it is a slow moving drama and this will not appeal to everyone.  It is extremely well done, make no mistake about that, but this is not the movie to go to if you are looking for escapism.  This is the movie to go to when you are looking to think critically about the film and what it is saying about the human condition.</p></body></html>

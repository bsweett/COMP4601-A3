"Pulp Fiction" is one of my favorites.  Quentin Tarantino is a very gifted director/writer.  Although I love his directing, I must say it is his writing that really impresses me.  But I will get to that later on in this review.<p>I think it's safe to say that the first time this movie was released on DVD, it was a little more than disappointing.  There were no special features, sound and picture was so-so; I mean, my laserdisk at least had three different trailers of the movie.  So, of course, I was very excited to learn that this movie was being re-released in a fully loaded special edition.  Re-buying the movie was well worth it, for this edition of the movie is far superior than the other one.<p>The movie really consists of three different stories; not in any order.  Any one of the stories could be their own little movies.  The players are two hitmen, a boxer, the big boss, the big boss' wife, a crazy gun store owner, a gimp, a cop named, Zed, a man who makes problems go away, and a little suitcase with "666" for the combination.  You add all this together and you get one hell of a movie.<p>The acting is more than superb; including one terrific cast with some heavy hitters (Travolta, Jackson, Thurman, Willis, etc.).  Tarantino is a master when it comes to writing and directing.  Especially when it comes to writing.  I have never heard such clever and brutally honest dialogue in any other movie.  I have said it before, and I will say it again; Tarantino reminds me of Raymond Carver, except with more humor.<p>Now, on to the special edition of this DVD.  Is it better than the previous version?  YES!  Tons of special features, and not to forget the fact that the movie has been restored in high definition.  Picture looks very clear.  And the sound is also a lot better.  You can watch the movie in DTS, which is always a good thing.<p>Special features.....where do I begin?  There's a ton of them!  It's not even funny how much stuff is loaded on this bad boy.  And every one of them is great.  Features include a documentary, an interview with Tarantino on "The Charlie Rose Show," trailers, filmographies, and many more.  If you love special features, then you will not be disappointed.<p>"Pulp Fiction" is a great movie, and the new DVD edition is outstanding in every way.  If you still have the older DVD of this movie, get this one now!  If you haven't seen it yet, check it out when you can!  Of course, with any other movie, there is a chance you may not like this movie.  That's fine, nothing wrong with that.  Don't let hype ruin your preception of the movie, just watch it as if it were any other movie.  You like it, great; if not, well, at least you gave it a shot.  Filled with sharp humor, great characters, outstanding dialogue, and some of the craziest surprises and twists, "Pulp Fiction" is a wonderful film, and will continue to be one of my favorites.</p></body></html>

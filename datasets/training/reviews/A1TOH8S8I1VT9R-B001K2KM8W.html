<meta name="summary" content="Keep those "No" votes coming!!  As entertainment, this film has big problems."></head><body><p>Let me start by offering my motivation for writing this review.  I recently purchased this movie on my brother's recommendation.  I like fantasy movies.  I heard this was "not for kids" (a very dark film).  As an artist, I can appreciate the artistic density of this movie (I'm thinking).  None of this posed a problem for me. I was sold.  I read the synopsis.  I'm still good with buying this film.  No problems.  Then I watched it.<br /><br />D@MN YOU BOB!!!  I should have known better.  You see, I also purchased "Brazil" on my brother's recommendation.  I don't think I'll ever watch that DVD again either.  Not surprisingly, though very different in context, these two films are very much the same in political leaning and emotional slather.  In fact, both films have nearly identical endings.<br /><br />Since I am exceedingly lazy and have limited time, I will resort to my habit of using bullet statements to convey to you why I don't like this kind of movie.  I will also avoid trying to write the names of people involved in making this film because I don't care (it's the film that matters);<br />( I'll try to point out spoilers with these ***)<br /><br />-This film, like "Brazil" leans hard left.  Personally, I don't care how it leans.  It does have a clear agenda outside of entertaining us with a "fantasy" story and that gives it a deceptive smell.  I wanted the fantasy, not the political statement.<br /><br />-Unlike Brazil, this film actually has historical precedence.  This is probably the only movie about 1944 Franco Spain that I have ever seen.  In retrospect, I really don't care what happened in 1944 Franco Spain.  I think bigger world changing events occurred at that time (or is it just me?).  Even though I have plenty of war movies and if this were not sold as a fantasy movie, I still would not have seen a film about life in Franco's Spain.<br /><br />-Like Brazil, this movie takes sides.  It's so easy to get the viewer to side with the poor downtrodden "rebels" especially here in the U.S...  But when I step back, I ask myself "What are the rebels rebelling against?"  In both films it's the established and accepted government.  Though imperfect or highly flawed, these governments provide infrastructure, economic stability and security (for a price).  The rebels usually kill perfectly happy innocent people too.  Making the rebels seam noble is a very cheap trick and I am not impressed.  Did you ever here of the ETA. They are the same people we are talking about here and they are considred terrorists in Spain today.  WHERE'S MY FANTASY?<br /><br />-In the commentary, the Director claims the fantasy is real.  I watched the movie and I have to disagree.  I know this is completely irrational, after all; he's the Director. However, other than a scene with mandrake root, everything points to the fantasy being an escape into one persons mind.  Escaping Franco's Spain.  Therefore this is not a fantasy movie, but a historical war movie.  What one person uses to escape the ugly horrors of Franco's Spain matters little to me since in my mind it is just a diversion.<br /><br />-Both films are undeniably artistic achievements.  If "Pan's Labyrinth" had no fantasy elements at all, it would be a very powerful film about life in the mountains of Franco's Spain (I really am tired of writing that).  Again, I did not really want to see a movie about "Franco's Spain".  I was deceived into watching a movie about you-know-where.<br /><br />-***Unlike Brazil, PL was very realistic.  In fact, this film was so realistic I could almost feel the blood splattering on my face as bullets whistle through men's bodies.  I could almost feel the bottle smashing my face in.  I could almost feel the knife ripping my cheek.  This begs the question.  What is this movie about?<br /><br />-***Oh yea, the fantasy.  If you separate the fantasy elements from the historical drama, you get a very short, scary, horrifying fantasy film.  Let's see, we get clawed baby eating monster with eyes in his hands.  We get said monster graphically chewing pixies in half. We get giant frogs that regurgitate themselves out of their skins.  We get a very creepy pan with a very irritating and creepy voice.  We get mandrake roots (very much like the "Harry Potter" mandrake roots) that require the little girl to bite herself to bleeding on it.  Wait, I just described a HORROR MOVIE!!!<br /><br />-I know many people just love to watch subtitles to preserve the integrity of the film.  What a load of tripe that is.  I had to watch one scene three times to catch all the overlapping dialogue.  Give me dubbing any day.  Done right, you can actually see the movie undistracted by words on the picture.<br /><br />-The villain in this film is such an evil SOB hating him becomes easy.  This begs the question; why did the mother remarry to such a jerk?  Of course, this just adds to the emotional slather I previously eluded too.  Why don't we ever get to meet the rebels torture meister?  I'm sure they would have had one.<br /><br />What's the point of all this?  What exactly am I getting at?  Pan's Labyrinth is sold as a fantasy film when it clearly is not.  You do get images from a fantasy world, true.  You even get grotesque fantasy creatures.  However, it's all rendered moot when the film is actually about the horrors of life during 1944 Franco Spain being so disturbing as to cause a little girl to take refuge in the fantasies of her mind (I don't believe the director for one second).  This is not what I wanted to see.  So I've written this review to give ample warning to those who DO NOT WANT TO SEE A FILM ABOUT LIFE DURING 1944 FRANCO SPAIN, artistic masterpiece or otherwise.  If you want to believe this is a fantasy film with Franco Spain as a backdrop, go for it.  That's not how I see it.</p></body></html>

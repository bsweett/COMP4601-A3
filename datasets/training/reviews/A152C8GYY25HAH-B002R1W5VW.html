<meta name="summary" content="All a thrller should be - clever, devious and entertaining"></head><body><p>"Matchstick Men" is one of the `hidden assets' of 2003. It did only fairly well at the boxoffice and was ignored at the yearend's awards feeding frenzy. This clever, subversive thriller from director Ridley Scott ["Gladiator", "Alien"] is a delight from start to finish. If it has a fault, it is that a plot twist near the end is so surprising and cruel that it was necessary to tack on a happy ending; however, said ending is both appropriate and logical, since the underlying theme is one of redemption.<p>Roy Waller [Nicolas Cage] is a lifelong con artist. He is a mass of nervous ticks, a walking definition of obsessive-compulsive disorder. His partner, Frank [Sam Rockwell] is calm, cool and collected. He puts up w Roy because Roy, is the master con. When Roy goes to a new shrink, it occurs to him that he may have had a child by his ex-wife fourteen years ago. The doctor verifies that he did, and Roy searches out the child, a bright, vivacious girl named Angela [Alison Lohman]. Father and daughter instantly bond. Meanwhile, Roy and his partner have the biggest con of their lives going on. At first a hindrance, Angela soon becomes a partner in crime, as though conning people was almost a genetic trait. <p>Cage, replete with nervous ticks and some speech impediments, is both funny and endearing as Roy, a con man who knows all too well the price his profession extracts from one's sole. Rockwell and Lohman are also excellent. <p>"Matchstick Men" is probably the most entertaining and rewarding thriller of 2003.</p></body></html>

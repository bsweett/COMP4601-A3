<meta name="summary" content="Not too Bad, but not Great either!"></head><body><p>Pitch Black brings to the screen the story of a spaceship carrying a wide variety of passengers that experiences technical problems while en route and is forced to crash land on a planet dominated by flying pterodactylus type monsters.<br /><br />The acting is very poor to the point that acting lessons are needed ASAP for everyone involved.<br /><br />The "bad guy" is much more like the usual pompous high school jock/"pretty boy" seen over and over again in those types of movies.  Apart from his weak appearance he fails to convince in his role as a mean and greedy drug addicted mercenary.<br /><br />Furthermore, he somehow manages to kick Vin Diesel's butt repeatedly!!!<br /><br />Moreover, what was the point of the Muslim cleric with his four acolytes???<br /><br />Or the Australian woman and the arrogant Englishman for that matter?<br /><br />Not to mention the obnoxious, spoiled kid who for some reason is not scared at being stuck on "hell planet" and who has a "surprise" for us later on in the movie.<br /><br />Unless of course the whole point of having these annoying characters in the film was for the audience to enjoy seeing them picked off one by one in true B-movie fashion (as I've seen other reviewers characterize the movie).<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's an average plot, the acting and the actors are very weak, the dialogues are poor and the special effects are very good.<br /><br />The potential for a great movie was definitely there, but the surprisingly poor acting/casting and the full of holes plot prevented it from becoming anything more than average.  As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a B-movie so one should not expect too much.<br /><br />Overall, both Vin Diesel as well as the rest of the "cast" do a rather poor job of trying to cover up for the mediocre plot; wait `til Pitch Black is shown on TV.</p></body></html>

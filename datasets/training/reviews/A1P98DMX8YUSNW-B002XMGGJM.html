<meta name="summary" content="Very violent vengeance viewing"></head><body><p>This one is a variation on the old-fashioned vengeance theme, with a surviving family man seeking to rub out anyone who had anything to do with his family's demise. That means the entire criminal justice system, which he thinks did him wrong. As this goes on, it appears that he is also a genius at killing other people himself, as he picks them off one by one from prison, using his highly developed skills. Despite several script holes and a huge lack of lgic to the whole thing, the movie does move along at a fast clip. You will be forced to watch one man cut up with ssaws, and another stabbed in the jugular with a T-bone steak bone, as well as a woman's head blown off by an exploding cellphone. If you like that sort of "entertainment," then watch.</p></body></html>

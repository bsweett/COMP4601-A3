<meta name="summary" content="Third Best Movie So Far This Year"></head><body><p>Except for troy and passion of the christ, this is the best movie so far this year (yes it is better then spiderman 2, by a little).  The action is great except for the ice battle, which is definetly not the best part of the movie because its too short and all that happens is they shoot some arrows and then one of the knights runs out and breaks the ice and they fall in.  The last battle is very impressive though, much better, with great choreography.  The performances are good and deserve a few nominations, mainly clive owen.  The drama is affective but we could use a little more info on some of the characters, arthur mainly.  I would nominate the movie for best picture, but i think troy might win, unless alexander is good.  I give it a 9 out of a 10.  Please make the DVD better with added footage, at least make the ice battle better.</p></body></html>

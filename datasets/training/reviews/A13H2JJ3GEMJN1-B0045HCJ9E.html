<meta name="summary" content="Another Hitchcock Classic"></head><body><p>There isn't much in the way of superlatives that I can say about NORTH BY NORTHWEST that can't already be found among the other reviews here. Bear with me while I simply point out the following:<br /><br />This is an Alfred Hitchcock movie. Hitchcock is regarded by many as the best movie-maker of the twentieth century. Furthermore, NBNW is is not just any Hitchcock movie, it's generally considered one of his best.<br /><br />The story begins with a classic case of mistaken identity in which our hero (played by Cary Grant) gets caught up in a case of international espionage. As the story unfolds, it's hard to be sure who can be trusted and who can't. The plot twists and turns, carrying the viewer on a roller-coaster ride from city to countryside and from the east coast to the Dakotas. The cast is excellent, several of the scenes are among the most memorable in cinematic history, the background scenery is often spectacular, and the music builds on the story's shifting moods extremely well.<br /><br />NBNW is a genuine Hollywood classic. The American Film Institute currently has in the fortieth position on its list of the 100 greatest movies and it's in the fourth spot in the sub-category of the 100 greatest movie thrillers.<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock made a slew of great movies. While a few (i.e. PSYCHO, THE BIRDS) are probably better known, NBNW and REAR WINDOW are my personal favorites. Both are simply excellent. Coincidentally, the proprietors of this web page are currently offering NBNW and REAR WINDOW together as a package deal. If I didn't already own both flicks, I'd be all over that. So, this is your chance to pick up two great movies in one quick purchase. My advice? Don't miss out. Get both. You won't be sorry.</p></body></html>

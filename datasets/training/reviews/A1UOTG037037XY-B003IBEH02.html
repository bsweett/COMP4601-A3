And it's the reason she was destroyed.  This was a surprisingly watchable movie.  Who wants to watch a movie about a daughter being killed, right?  I didn't want to watch Mystic River or that Affleckted movie but this one is totally different in tone and delivery.  It's awesome.  I recommend it. See if you believe for one second how this story is "resolved."</p></body></html>

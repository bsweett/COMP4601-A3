<meta name="summary" content="Shout at the Devil"></head><body><p>After recently reviewing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L20IF6">The Last Exorcism</a>, I noticed that many of the other reviewers of the movie were suggesting that it was not as scary or effective as 2005's The Exorcism of Emily Rose. I had never seen Emily Rose so I gave it a try this past weekend (and the price sure was right for a used copy here on Amazon!). It turned out that those other reviewers that I referred to were correct; Emily Rose is a well done, well acted, thought provoking and scary movie told in a sequence of flashbacks from two points of view: those who believe it was demonic possession and those who would discredit and even prosecute the priest responsible for Emily's exorcism and ultimate death.<br /><br />Jennifer Carpenter (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003N0QEJA">Dexter</a>) is Emily and while she never goes completely <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001992NW4">Regan</a>, she gets pretty close at times and does a heck of job creeping the viewer out. Yeah, in fact Director Scott Derrickson keeps viewers completely creeped out for the whole film.<br /><br />According to the opening of the movie, Emiliy Rose is "based on a true story".  Derrickson uses some clever deception tactics to make you think that the characters and events in Emily Rose actually happened, but in reality the movie is mostly Hollywood imagination that is quite loosely based on the story of Anneliese Michel. (If you look up Anneliese Michel on Wikipedia you'll find a brief description of her events and a link to a 90 minute tape if Anneliese's actual exorcism...which I wouldn't have the guts to play if you paid me!)<br /><br />I'd highly recommend checking out Emily Rose if, like me for whatever reason, you missed it back in 2005.</p></body></html>

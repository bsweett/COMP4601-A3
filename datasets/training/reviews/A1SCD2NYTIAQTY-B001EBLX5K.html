<meta name="summary" content="Cohen is a Very Brave Man"></head><body><p>"Borat" has caused so much comment to fly, not to mention paperwork for over-paid litigation lawyers, that one is almost obligated to see what all the fuss was about. In one of the first scenes, when Borat says "I like sex. It is nice.", you get a pretty good prelude to what is to follow.<br /><br />This is politically incorrect, tasteless, offensive and crass humour, to put it mildly. However, despite myself, I had to admit that Borat was pretty cool guy and that Cohen is a much braver man than I. Offending everyone from driving instructors, rodeo managers and audiences, passengers on trains, people in the street and etiquette coaches, "Borat" really is "in-your-face" humour.<br /><br />The basic premise of the movie is Borat's journey to the "US and A" to find out about that great country so as to improve his native Kazakhstan. Along the way, he falls in love and travels across the entire country to find the woman of his dreams. I still wonder that he didn't get pounded into a pulp by the security.<br /><br />Despite all the rudeness, I was very surprised that there was a bit of a sensitive side to the movie as well, between Borat and Luenell. It was a nice little message, if somewhat cliched and corny.<br /><br />In short, this movie is not for everyone. If sexual references and nudity are not your thing, I would avoid this one like the bubonic plague. Would I see it again? No. However, I am glad that I have seen it. Some parts were genuinely funny, and others made me cringe. However, it was good and fun.</p></body></html>

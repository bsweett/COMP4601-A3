<meta name="summary" content="When in Doubt, Call the Exorcist!!"></head><body><p>There is much ado about nothing when it comes to "Doubt". Certainly it has a potent albeit badly delivered message; it has stellar performances that nonetheless come too close to caricature. It is always unwise to attempt to insert levity where levity is not welcome.<br /><br />Meryl Streep's turn as Sister-Mother-Superior-Wannabe Aloysius (correct spelling is Aloisius by the bye) is simultaneously shocking, powerful and silly. Philip Seymour Hoffman as the beleaguered Father Flynn is a character study worthy of Spencer Tracy. He has his dark side and dark moments, which still look fairly innocuous to me. I recall that Golden Rule of innocent until proven guilty.<br /><br />What are we, the audience, supposed to doubt? Streep's sanity? Hoffman's sincerity? Didn't the sweet, angelic Sr. James (Amy Adams) steal the show completely? Did Father Flynn abuse young Donald Miller (played beautifully by Joseph Foster II and miscredited at the end as "Daniel Miller")? Was he merely protecting young Donald? Did he identify with young Donald's emerging gayness (something Donald's mother clearly discloses to Streep)?<br /><br />Will the question marks ever end??<br /><br />In a way, this film is sheer insanity-in-the-making. A wicked witch of a nun, overburdened as a school's principal, automatically hates and suspects the young priest working at the school. She's out to get him, because she can smell a rat at a hundred paces.<br /><br />Yet there really is something 'funny' about the priest. His nails are too long. He resents the Church and its Medievalism. He dislikes the principal for her very crumbly old fashioned ways. When confronted, he seems so innocent and purely motivated. That is, until his facade begins to crack in an ugly way, and we think we see a guilty, evasive criminal.<br /><br />Is he a child molester after all? Umm, I do not know to this day. And I've scrutinized the film over a dozen times. All I can tell you is I do not believe Fr. Flynn guilty as charged ... and perhaps that was the main message. I'll never really know.<br /><br />We know very well that the era of pedophile priests had begun to emerge into the public eye at this time, the late 1960s. So, did the priest victimize a ready-made victim, the only black child in the school? Or did he love this child a bit more than he loved the others? Was he merely protecting young Donald?<br /><br />Here's what we do know: nasty looks shot at Fr. Flynn by certain students (BIG clue, thanks a lot). In fact, the little bastard who smiles at the news that Fr. Flynn is leaving gives us nothing - precisely because he's a little bastard. We know the old nun is checking out the priest, investigating his past. We know she's willing to manually explode her rosary into tiny pieces in her crusade to "get" Fr. Flynn.<br /><br />Like a bad, very bad mystery, this film reveals nothing at the end. Nothing but Sr. Aloysius' "doubts" - and I still ask myself, "What?? What does she doubt?", because we are never told what it is she doubts. My wife thought she was doubting her own faith. I thought she was doubting whether she did the right thing, except that she was glad and showed no remorse. Maybe she's doubting that this movie is going to be as good as she assumed ... which I seriously doubt.<br /><br />I took away TWO stars from this alleged 5-star film, one for the bad story-telling and one for the stupidly missed chances to make solid statements about pedophilia, racism and Medieval Church practices. It would have made a fine, tense drama bordering on a thriller, say, in the hands of Hitchcock - who reportedly was scared to death of Catholic nuns.<br /><br />Truly, I can hear Hitchcock's unmelodious voice saying, "One doubts this film is any good at all, but who can say for certain?"<br /><br />Also I say this: now is not the time to begin sowing doubt of any kind about the evil of pedophelia. It is rampant in the Catholic Church and it is all out of control. Is this a time to begin making people doubt?<br /><br />The movie needed to have a solid story, not spoonfeeding anyone with it, only knowing what it wanted to say. It communicated 'doubt' itself brilliantly, but again, it is the wrong message at the wrong time. In the midst of all this pain, denial, the Church running for cover, priests retaining lawyers - BAD time to start doubting!<br /><br />There is one undercurrent that occurred to me that is not mentioned: the very real damage the Church has inflicted on its clergy. Are both Sr. Aloysius and Fr. Flynn victims themselves? God knows what created a beast like Sr. Aloysius, but the Sisters Aloysius of the world may have created the Fathers Flynn.<br /><br />Even this, deep as it may appear, does not solve the mystery of Fr. Flynn, but it starts to infect Sr. James in a horrible way, a way that teaches how easily these awful contaminates can spread through holy institutions. Of that there is NO doubt.</p></body></html>

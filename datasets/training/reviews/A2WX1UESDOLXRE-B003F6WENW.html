<meta name="summary" content="I Don't Think I've Ever Laughed So Hard At The Movies!!!"></head><body><p>I think the last time I really, and I mean seriously, laughed during a movie was when I saw Bruce Almighty for the first time. I almost couldn't help it though -- Jim Carrey and his facial expressions and voice inflections are too much. My uproarious laughter during this movie stems from the hilarious and witty dialogue spoken by two comic greats -- Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. Talk about an amazing team! Truth be told, I'm not a big fan of movies like Anchorman or Old School or Dodegball, so I went into the theater expecting something similar. I would say that fans of the previously mentioned movies won't be disappointed with Wedding Crashers and neither should anyone else. It's a fantastic comedy.<br /><br />Wilson and Vaughn star as John and Jeremy, two guys who can't wait till wedding season. They love the food, they love making up stories and background information about the "characters" they're going to be, and oh yeah, the women. The main reason for crashing weddings is to bed as many bridesmaids as possible. And they're good. After watching a montage of weddings that these guys crash, Jeremy decides they should end the season with one last hoorah. John reluctantly agrees; he was looking forward to putting wedding season behind him. Then it happens -- John falls in love with a pretty bridesmaid (Rachel McAdams, Mean Girls; The Notebook). Suddenly he's breaking the rules of wedding crashing -- never stay too long, don't get involved, etc. Unfortunately for Jeremy, he slept with a crazy, clingy redhead who confessed that she loved him after only two hours of knowing him. She sticks to him like glue the entire time, and the look on his face everytime she kisses him is hilarious. The girl's family is kooky -- cursing grandmother, wacky brother, politician father, and of course, the girl has a jerky boyfriend. What's a wedding crasher to do?<br /><br />How many times can I describe this movie as hilarious? Well, however long it takes to get you to the theater to see it. You won't regret it, you'll be laughing so hard that your side will actually hurt. This movie isn't without physical comedy, but the best stuff is in the dialogue, which is better than most dramas (remind me why dramas are so popular... oh yeah, the "riveting dialogue," something said way too often by film critics). CHECK THIS ONE OUT!!!</p></body></html>

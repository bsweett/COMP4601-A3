<meta name="summary" content="Highly entertaining sci-fi remake."></head><body><p>Remake to the popular 1968 original stars Mark Wahlberg as a pilot who crashlands onto an alien planet where apes rule and humans are their slaves.  This re-imagining obviously won't play well with fans of the original, but holds appeal to those looking for straight-out action/adventure.  Fast-paced, pulse-pounding, funny, and even rousing, this is ideal summer-based entertainment.  The ending is a bit silly, however (still enjoyably so).</p></body></html>

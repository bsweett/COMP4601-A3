<meta name="summary" content="WONDERFUL FANTASY FILM"></head><body><p>Of epic proportion and sumptuously filmed, this first entry in the CS Lewis Chronicles of Narnia is a cinematic delight.<br /><br />Transported the world of Narnia where animals talk and witches fly, four youngsters find themselves embroiled in a battle to save the people of Narnia from the very wicked White Witch.<br /><br />The costumes, music, lighting, special effects, and direction are all superb, and the cast is a revelation.  The four children are well played by Georgie Henley (the cutest little tyke since Drew Barrymore in ET); Skandor Keynes as the dark and brooding Edmond; William Moseley (looking like a cross between Richard Thomas and a young Heath Ledger) is the gallant older brother destined to be king; Anna Popplewell is the reserved, upstanding older sister; Tilda Swinton is awesome as the witch, conveying a chilling evil not recently seen; and James McEvoy is delightful as the faun, Mr. Thommus.  Under Andrew Adamson's (SHREK) sure direction, the movie is a marvelous fantasy indeed.  Even though it is somewhat violent, there is no lingering gore, so kids should be allright with it.</p></body></html>

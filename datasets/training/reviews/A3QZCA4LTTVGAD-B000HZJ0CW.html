Once more, we enter the sci-fi world of the intrepid crew of the Starship "Enterprise." This latest installment in the ongoing "Trek" saga opens with turmoil on Romulus, the homeworld of one of humanity's perennial foes. The "Enterprise," still under the command of Capt. Picard (Patrick Stewart), is sent out to deal with the situation. The film introduces a new alien race: the Remans, who hail from Romulus' sister planet. Key to the story is Shinzon, who grew up on the Reman homeworld yet has a strange and very personal connection to Picard.<p>"Nemesis" certainly has a lot of good elements going for it. The Remans, who reminded me of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" type demons, are a visually impressive alien race, and equally impressive is Shinzon's massive warship. There are some well played action sequences, and it's great to see the Next Gen crew together again.<p>But I felt by the film's end that its makers had aimed for an epic scope and emotional resonance which they never quite achieved. While the film is certainly a great improvement over the last Next Gen feature (the limp "Insurrection"), it never achieves the heights reached in the best of the Next Gen films ("First Contact") or in the best of the TV episodes.<p>Maybe part of the problem is the villain Shinzon, played by Tom Hardy. He too often comes across as a petulant schoolboy. I didn't fully buy him as the brilliant, battle-hardened military commander he allegedly is. He's not in the same league as Trek's best villains, like Khan or the Borg Queen. Also, while the Remans are visually striking and as a species have a compelling history, I felt that in the end they were underdeveloped as a new alien race. And while Ron Perlman brings a commanding presence to his role as the Reman Viceroy, I felt the filmmakers seriously underutilized his great talents.<p>Other aspects of the film struck me as gratuitous or clumsily put together (particularly some sexual innuendo that seems stuck at a junior high mentality). And, like "Star Trek: Insurrection," some aspects of the film had a "been there, done that" feel to them; Hardy's Shinzon in particular felt uncomfortably like a rip-off of a certain blonde nemesis already faced by the Next Gen crew during their TV run.<p>These gripes aside, I must still say that I enjoyed "Nemesis," and I do hope that this film is not the end of the line for either the Next Gen crew or the toothy Remans.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Reser-Blu Dogs!!!"></head><body><p>It's nice to see that Lions gate is putting out better Blu's these days,their Blu's of films like T2,The Punisher,Stargate are pretty void of extras,they look good but Blu's can hold a %#$@load of content,much more than a DVD,get me wrong I DO own those mentioned titles,and they do look great on Blu but they could have been so much more,so if you have the origianl DVD's keep em' for the extras,I smell yee' ol' double dip in the future,especially since the new Punisher and upcoming Terminator film,well back to the review,Reservioe Dogs has never looked of sounded better,and the extras a top flight,but keep your 10th anniversary dvd,because the extras here are different than the ones on that release!!! No collectable gas can case,but heck,the folks at Amazon had it on sale for less than 10 bones brand spanking new,can't argue w/ that!!! A Tarentino(his debut) classic!!! Recommended!!!

<meta name="summary" content="A Cohen Classic"></head><body><p>By far the best Cohen film ever, and that's saying a lot.  This movie is glorious.  The Javier Bardem character is fantastic; his cool efficiency is very impressive.  I particularly like the gas station scene - great interaction with manager guy.  The dialog throughout is very good, the tempo is great, sense of dread, etc. Note, though, this is a good degree of a cerebral film, not your standard killer fare.  Lots of mood setting, slowly building events, etc.  Brilliant though.</p></body></html>

I believe that show is one of the greatest action packed hours of television you can find at the current time.  After watching Kiefer Sutherland promote the Sentinel like it was going to be similar to 24, my expectations were pretty high to say the least...<br /><br />and what we got was a below average action flick that didn't really feature as much action as I hoped.  The first 45 minutes of the film positively dragged.  The idea was to build suspense, but it didn't work in my opinion.  Kiefer's character was on the same awesome level as usual, though.<br /><br />Michael Douglas could have been better.  His character was convincing, but just barely.  The movie seriously doesn't live up to the hype.  Watch the TV show 24 instead to show the proper way to glue viewers into a plotline.</p></body></html>

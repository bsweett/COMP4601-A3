<meta name="summary" content="death to all alien bugs"></head><body><p>this one packs a wallop but some things are way to dumb. the aliens are top notch and way to many to kill. the battles are awesome and the cast is lively. the part where the head alien sucks the brains from his victims is gooey and fun and Casper Van Dien(Sleepy Hollow, Python), looks like he had a good old time riding that bug.</p></body></html>

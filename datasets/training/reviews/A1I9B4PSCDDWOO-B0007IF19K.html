<meta name="summary" content="Foxx is Ray Charles"></head><body><p>The rating should be about 3.5 stars. First I would like to say that Jaime Foxx gave a performance of his life in this movie. He managed to captured the physical behavior of Ray Charles without trying to mimic him. That is a hard thing to do for an actor. Foxx's performance is probably the best I have seen this year and definitely lightyears ahead of anyone else. The music and sound of the movie was also a winner. Foxx captured Ray Charles superbly well in all aspects.<br /><br />Having wrote all that, why wasn't this movie rated "five"? Well, just because the actor is fantastic, doesn't make the film that way. Ultimately, this movie was downer for me. Take away Ray Charles' genius and talent for music and this is what you have: a drug addict, a bad and faithless husband, lousy father and fair-weathered friend. His ambition made him self driven but at the same time, self-centered. In this movie without his music, Ray Charles was one miserable human being. I am sure Ray Charles did more during the Civil Right movement then just refusing to played for a Jim Crow concert in Georgia. The movie didn't focus on any of his positive aspects outside of his music. Didn't he had any positive aspects personally?? I supposed at the end of the movie when he finally kicked the heroin addiction, he became a better man to his family, friends and to himself but we don't get to see how he evolved. Non-musical aspects of the movie dealt with his negatives, even the flashbacks scenes showing Ray Charles as a boy exactly don't help as if it was creating an excuse why Ray is such a lousy guy outside of his music. The movie was repetitive with scenes of Ray cheating on his wife, taking drugs and using up loyal friends. It was rather one dimensional in that aspect.<br /><br />But its still a good film, Jaime Foxx's performance glued you to that theater seat. Even during the "slow and dragging" parts of the film of which there were quite a few, Foxx's performance was good enough to keep you from yawning. Can this get him the Oscar nomination? It should and a win to go with it!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Excellent Sequel"></head><body><p>Sequels that have been filmed back to back tend to be disapointing, like the Matrix sequels. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest doesn't disapoint though. It can drag on and on but once it's over it actually makes you want more that very second. The action, direction, effects, make-up and performances are all in top form. Even Orlando Bloom is better than usual and gives a better performance as Will Turner than he did in the first movie. His character is better developed as is Keira Knightley's. While Johny Depp is as unpredictable as always as Captain Jack Sparrow. The script is smart how it uses all of them, they all have something to do and just aren't back for the hell of it.<br /><br />  The new additions to the cast also do excellent jobs. Bill Nighy is wonderfully evil as the squid faced Davy Jones. Stellan Skarsg?rd is also really good as Bootstrap Bill Turner. He's half alive with starfish stuck to his face and forced to serve Davy Jones. Although he's not new to the cast, Jack Davenport gives us a different Norrington than the one in the first film. Here he's about as dirty as Jack Sparrow and short of dignity after he lost Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and his duties as a soldier. He has no choice but to join Jack Sparrow's crew when he despises him.<br /><br />  Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is pretty long but offers more thrills and surprises than Superman Returns I must admit. It's action scenes are often either silly or exciting. While Gore Verbinski is an expert at making a good pirate movie. His Pirate of the Carribean movies are full of lively and interesting characters. I can't wait to see what he has instore for us with part 3 since he threw so much excitement at us just in the second installment.</p></body></html>

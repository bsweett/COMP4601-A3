<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable post-apocalyptic movie"></head><body><p>I admit it - I love these post-apocalyptic movies and documentaries - Life After People, Aftermath: Population Zero, Waterworld, etc. This movie was a real treat for me to watch. Yes, lots of critics complain that such a thing wouldn't happen that quickly, but I like these kinds of movies for the warning they give us as well as the thought they provoke (What would you do if you were in this kind of situation?) and I loved the special effects as well as showing the various people trying to deal with this situation and the sadness that is inevitable from this kind of catastrophe - the people drowning or freezing to death, and the unique US-to-Mexico panicked immigration was a clever added bit.</p></body></html>

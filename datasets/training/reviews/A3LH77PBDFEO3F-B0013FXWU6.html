<meta name="summary" content="There Isn't Any Character"></head><body><p>When There Will Be Blood came out I was very interested in seeing it. My family was involved in the oil industry in one way or another from 1959 to 1987. One of the first places the film names is Signal Hill in Long Beach CA where my mother was a dispatcher for many years, and my father was a scientist that developed the project to inject steam into the tar in Yorba Linda Ca, that was later adopted to Kern County and other places that provide a majority of domestic crude oil. I myself worked for many years on oil rigs in Kern County (Oildale, Belridge, Taft etc. until my last day when I nearly lost my hand in '87) So.... I thought a film about the early days of California's oil industry would be fascinating.<br /><br />But here is the deal,<br />Every character in the film is  so narcissistic and amoral that the great acting and stunning cinematography was just wasted. I didn't care about any of the characters in the story (with the exception of the wife of the son) enough to enjoy the film at all.<br /><br />So if you want a movie that is well acted, and well filmed, but is unmoving and dull with an annoying soundtrack, this is for you. Otherwise, find something a bit more upbeat.<br /><br />2 1/2*</p></body></html>

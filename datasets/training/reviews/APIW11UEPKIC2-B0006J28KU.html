It plays out like a tv show but manages to cut out all the excess fat perfectly.  Suer, you would like to know a bit more about the charaxcters, but even the people from the casting department admit tehy were still hiring actors up to the last day of shooting.  I have not seen such a star studded cast in a GREAT movei like thsi since True Romance".  The feeling you have for the characters is so strong, you will never see another movie like this. They spend pretty much the whole movie planning out the heist and when it happens, you are glad they waited.  Cops and robbers going at it just like a movie should be:)<br /><br />The special featrues are a bit short and has like a 100 minute running time.  It gives you a lot of good insight on the real story behind the movie.  And also michael mann and the rest of cast give good info.  And good stuff on how it was written to ne a tv show.  Teh commentary was pretty boring, but I like excitng commentaries, I guess I expect them all to be like Anchorman:)</p></body></html>

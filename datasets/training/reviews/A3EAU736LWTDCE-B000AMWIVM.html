<meta name="summary" content="good gore...more gore please"></head><body><p>I liked this movie a lot, I don't get all the negative reviews. However, I have a different complaint than most people though: I would really have liked to see more people fall victims of this killers elaborate traps (I would have liked to seen more traps) More gore please. Even though it did give some good gore, it just teased me.<br /><br />I think people didn't like this movie because of the ending, which I liked a lot. Or people are just crying because they couldn't figure out the ending. You cannot win, people either cry when a movie is predictable, or they cry when it doesn't follow the norm. Make up your mind morons. Anyway, it filled part of my gore meter, so I was happy with it. Loved the ending</p></body></html>

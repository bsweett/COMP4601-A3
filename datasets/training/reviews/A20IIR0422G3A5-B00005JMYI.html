<meta name="summary" content="Average Comedy. Not as good as Elf."></head><body><p>`Anchorman, The Legend of Ron Burgundy' (the unrated version) cowritten by and starring Will Ferrell is a sophomoric comedy based on one idea borrowed from the very rich plot of `Broadcast News', spiked with some tired themes the character Ted Baxter of the Mary Tyler Moore Show plus some other borrowings from less likely sources such as `Monty Python and the Holy Grail'.<br /><br />For starters, I simply did not laugh at this movie. Not once! It was less funny to me than a Three Stooges short, and I don't like the Three Stooges. This is not to say I don't appreciate some good potty humor now and then. I happen to think that Kevin Smith's foul-mouthed marathons such as `Dogma' and `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' are really very, very funny.<br /><br />One of the most deadly aspects of the movie was that it was predictable. You can see punchlines coming from two blocks away. Even the crudest, cheapest gag / shock value in the movie which involved Burgundy's small, much beloved dog being kicked off the highest point of the high bridge over San Diego bay could be anticipated, as improbable as cruelty to animals scenes are in movies. The fact that the canine body falling to San Diego bay was so obviously a dummy dog neither improved the comedy nor took the sting out of the cheapness of the business.<br /><br />Ferrell has had a fair amount of success since he left Saturday Night Live and many, including Kevin Smith attest to his comedic abilities, but I just don't see it. I watched `Elf' a few months ago and I could appreciate that it was a better than average Christmas movie, but it really wasn't anything special. I just don't think Ferrell has the kind of natural comedic talent of people like Billy Crystal or Dan Aykroyd, let alone the comic geniuses like Jim Carrey, Bill Murray, and Robin Williams. Carrey and even Williams can sometimes become parodies of themselves, but the lapses usually don't last too long, and in any given 5 minutes on the screen they will get a laugh out of you by hook or by crook.<br /><br />There are many ways in which this is not a really bad movie. It probably is no less a cartoon of its subject than `Zoolander' or `Animal', but it is neither laugh out loud funny like `Garfield' nor `wryly funny like `Doonesbury'. The only character in the movie for which I had any sympathy at all was the news director played by Fred Willard. Ferrell's foil, the female newscaster played by Christina Applegate was too predictable and unnatural to elicit much empathy from me, especially since her competition was so artificial.<br /><br />If a movie is good, I typically rate DVDs on the basis of the quality of the bonus features. This is why a Kevin Smith DVD is such a good bargain compared to even great classic comedy DVDs such as `Ghostbusters' or `Some Like It Hot'. If the principals are not around to provide a good commentary, the rewatchability drops a bit. But this movie is not entertaining to begin with, so what interest do I have in listening to a commentary of why they decided to punt a dog dummy off the San Diego bridge.<br /><br />This movie may be worth a rent, but not a buy.</p></body></html>

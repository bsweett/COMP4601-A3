<meta name="summary" content="Classic themes and spider webs - a comic gem"></head><body><p>The second installment of the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; saga is likely to be the crown jewel of the series, a blend of comic fantasy and human realism that satisfies action addicts just enough while exploring duality and classist society as well as the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy.<br /><br /> In Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst director Sam Raimi has a couple that transcends the genre: They are not their generation's best actors - Maguire's squeaky turn in &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; proves that - but their personalities - bright, humble, hopeful, just a smidge goofy - are perfectly attuned to this fare. They like others, they like each other, we like them. &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; works on other levels, but mostly because Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson are kids we'd be proud to know (or raise), played by actors who still seem closer to Earth than Hollywood.<br /><br /> The sequel begins two years after the original: Peter is balancing crime-fighting, college and a pizza job while Mary Jane does off-Broadway Oscar Wilde (to unlikely full houses.) Peter's friend Harry (James Franco) still vows vengeance against Spider-Man for killing his father; he's also bankrolling a Nobel scientist working on fusion, Dr. Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina).<br /><br /> Octavious, who wears artificially intelligent mechanical arms to work the ball of energy, is a idol of Peter's, who happens to be writing a paper on the doctor on the day of invention unveiling, when all goes awry. The accident leaves Octavious at the behest of the giant, powerful mechanical arms, who immediately want to recreate the experiment by any means necessary.<br /><br /> Meanwhile, Peter is torn between duty and Mary Jane. His instincts and web slings are on the blink. He's late to Mary Jane's play. He loses the pizza job. He's on the outs with his Aunt May (an excellent Rosemary Harris). Harry wants Peter to produce Spider-Man. And newspaperman J. Jonah Jameson (J.K Simmons) still runs Spidey through the wringer on the front page of his tabloid. Peter seriously begins to contemplate walking away from heroism when Mary Jane gets engaged to Jameson's astronaut son.<br /><br /> Alvin Sargent's screenplay understands what issues withstand the opening weekend box office; the movie takes its time to explore Peter's connection to friends, family, and the citizens he protects. Spider-Man is among the people, not above them. He tires. He gets snippy. An excellent &quot;dying with pride&quot; spech from Harris argues for duty against dream. It's a two-hour comic book, yet firmly rooted in working-class ideals. The subtextual arguments against the media and irresponsible science reject elitism - notice how villainous attacks in both movies are against everyday commuters. Notice that Jonah pits both sides against each other for what he believes to be maximum effect while the masses embrace Spider-Man. Notice in a small scene at Mary Jane's theater how petty, circular art rules conspire to keep Peter from the Oscar Wilde play. Raimi and Sargent are quiet about it, but the movie underlines classic themes, and it does so without gore or violence of nihilism run amok. For bright, receptive teens, &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; carries an excellent message.<br /><br /> Which doesn't mean the movie's perfect. Again the villain is thrown into the background, and while Doc Ock is more imposing than The Green Goblin, it doesn't make him any more memorable. Alfred Molina is serviceable but not wicked - his &quot;evil&quot; humor is droll and detached, his menace casual. Though Franco is a decent young actor, Harry Osborn is a poorly-written, ill-motivated villain-in-waiting, and &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; looks less promising according to the hints dropped at the end of this movie.<br /><br /> The central love story of Peter and Mary Jane, however, is strong enough to withstand hammy, average foes - expect two for the next &quot;Spider-Man.&quot; This movie's final shot suggests there is more emotional terrain to cover despite Mary Jane's revelations; whether Raimi and Sargent remain a team for the future pictures, the critical groundwork is in place. &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and his girl will be with us for some time.</p></body></html>

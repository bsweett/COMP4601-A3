Truth to be told, you will never know, because surprises abound in this Hitchcock movie with a plot based on a "wrong man scenario".<br /><br />Do you want to know more? Well, the main character is Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant), an advertising executive that is mistaken for George Kaplan, a spy that supposedly works for the USA government. The problem is that he is wrongly identified by foreign spies working in America, who are extremely eager to kill him and not particularly predisposed to believe that he is, in fact, Roger O. Thornhill. That is the reason why Roger faces two choices: to run or to be killed. Needless to say, he embraces the first choice, running for his life whilst attempting to learn more about the real Mr. Kaplan. Roger will get unexpected help from a beautiful and mysterious woman, Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). But is she with or against him?. And where on earth is George Kaplan?<br /><br />The answers to those questions are likely to keep the spectator enthralled. Of course, the fact that "North by Northwest"  has a great director, an outstanding cast, excellent musical score (Bernard Herrmann) and a fluid script (Ernest Lehman) doesn't hurt, either  :)  All in all, highly recommended!<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Twisted Look At An Already Twisted Tale"></head><body><p>Tim Burton has almost always managed to please me with his directorial turns.  The only film of his that I haven't enjoyed was "Batman Returns," because I felt he took a little too much artistic license on that one.  In "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," we have a twisted children's tale that seems to be tailored to Burton's vision.<br /><br />I'll bet that most folks are more familiar with the Gene Wilder "Wonka" of years past instead of Roald Dahl's wonderful book.  With that in mind, I'll use the Wilder feature for comparison.  First off, Johnny Depp is pretty good as Wonka.  He's somewhat creepy, with a look and tone almost like Michael Jackson.  He doesn't care for families that much, due to his own sick childhood.  In fact, he's more like a grown-up Peter Pan.  He seems to want to live in a fantasy world where he rules with a sugar-coated smile.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is nice.  The kid who plays Charlie has wonderful appeal.  Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregard, and Mike Teavee are also cast very well.  They are brats, and fit this story well.  The only kid I had a problem with was Augustus Gloop.  He almost looked fake.  He had a Wesson-like glow to his skin that made him appear unnatural and disturbing.  The adults were cast pretty good also.<br /><br />The Oompa Loompas were peculiar.  They shared the same face and were much smaller than the ones in the old version of the film.  I did enjoy their musical numbers in this flick more than in the original.<br /><br />The fates of each of the bratty children were well executed, but might scare the little ones.<br /><br />Overall, this is a twisted look at a story that was already twisted.  I enjoyed it, but I don't know how well it will go over with other folks.  For the adults in the audience, it's probably going to be a walk down memory lane.  For children uninitiated, it might be a little bit too different than their modern, politically-correct world where everybody's a winner and nobody's a bad person.<br /><br />Tim Burton is creepy.  I don't think anyone would argue with me on that.  In turn, he makes "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" even creepier.  Recommended for families with older kids(5 and up) since a few of the scenes(especially the demise of Veruca Salt) may come across a little bit too scary for the young'uns.</p></body></html>

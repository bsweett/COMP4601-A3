After watching this execrable dross it dawned on me that I just wasted 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life that I won't be getting back.<br /><br />Yet, perhaps it was just me?  Much of the audience did laugh from time to time at the often slap stick humour.  I just found it predictable and tired.<br /><br />The original film of 2001 was fresh and at sometimes amusing.  This sequel, however,  showed that you can only get so much out of the one idea.  Bridget Jones had morphed into an absurd caricature.  She even gets stuck in a Thai jail on a drugs charge!  What's more, the feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu when her two suitors are involved in another fight is palpable.  It just wasn't funny!<br /><br />If you're even just thinking of seeing this film, don't waste your time!</p></body></html>

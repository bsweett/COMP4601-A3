<meta name="summary" content="Special effects make it worthwhile"></head><body><p>OVERVIEW: I believe there are two ways to watch "The Day After Tomorrow". The 1st way is to go in with lofty expectations and look for real-life happenings backed up by facts and real-world stuff. The 2nd way is to go into this movie not expecting much at all --> hey another Hollywood disaster flick with some cool special effects! I went into this movie with no expectations... and for the most part enjoyed it. The storyline was weak at best, the acting was uninspired, but the movie as a whole was brought together by the terrible weather. Severe ice and snow storms, tidal waves (hence flooding), tornados, and more reaking havoc on planet Earth.<br /><br />THE GOOD: The special effects were awesome. The huge waves coming into NYC looked incredible. The waves engulfing the Statue of Liberty and taking over the streets were very cool. The numerous high speed tornados in Los Angeles were nicely done, but even the average viewer could tell they were computer generated. The rain and snow looked good and the freezing effects were believeable. Jake Gyllenhaal put in his finest performance since "October Sky" (1999).<br /><br />THE NOT SO GOOD: The cast is weak. Dennis Quaid (as father Jack Hall, special-meteorologist-predictor-guy) is just not on my "top actors" list. Quaid is a better "made-for-TV" movie actor than one on the big screen (let alone to carry most of the movie). Outside of "Frequency", "The Parent Trap" and "The Rookie", it's been too many years in between since I've really enjoyed one of his movies. Jake Gyllenhaal ("October Sky", "Donnie Darko", "Bubbleboy") was fine as Sam Hill (the son of Jack) and I truly believe he is an up-and-comer in Hollywood, but, he and his agent just haven't found that next 'right' script. Sela Ward is present briefly as the supportive Hall wife. Other than these 3 movie family members... you won't recognize anyone - the remaining cast of hundreds are no-names. Was Quaid the first choice here, or did every other actor decline the lead role for this movie? There are so many impossible (or nearly impossible) things going on in "The Day After Tomorrow" that if you sit and analyze everything that's happening you won't enjoy the movie. For example, after Jack Hall's truck gets stuck in the snow, he decides to trek from Philly to NYC to rescue his son... no small feat to do when the severe cold is killing everyone who walks outside in about 15 seconds. Did anyone mention the distance of 100 miles between the two cities? Or the tennis rackets he duck-taped to his feet so he could walk on the 50-foot snow drifts? The wolves chasing Sam on the ship were notebly exaggerated computer-made knock offs. The tidal wave coming into the city arrived in seconds, yet young Sam could run half a football field and back to save the girl and get back inside before the wave hits them. What about the rest of the world (this movie concentrated solely on America)? It would have been neat to see France's Eiffel Tower blitzed by the deep freeze or at least knocked over by a twister. The list goes on.<br /><br />MISC: The extras on this DVD are minimal. There are 2 commentaries to choose if that's your thrill. One with director Emmerich. The 2nd with the co-writer, editor and director of photography (yawn!). Did Quaid & Gyllenhaal decline? There are 2 deleted scenes (yawn), and a making-of footage for your PC (what the?). If you're looking for an accurate rendention of the effects of global warming - you'll be sorely disappointed (the Bush administration has not endorsed this movie). Come into this movie with few or no expectations and an eye for some cool weather related special effects and perhaps you'll get more out of it. Rating: A generous 3 stars.</p></body></html>

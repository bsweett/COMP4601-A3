<meta name="summary" content="RUN OF THE MILLA"></head><body><p>Okay, everyone.  This is a movie based on a popular video game.  Enough said.  Now, as a movie, it is a fast-paced, roller coast ride of a film.  We're not talking HAMLET here, folks.  Director Paul Anderson keeps the action fire hot, and the cast play their roles as one would expect in this kind of movie.<br /><br />The visual effects (for a non video-game fantatic like me) are well done, and there are some jump out of your seat moments.  Milla Jovovich, who was so good in FIFTH ELEMENT, has a rubber face that displays a wide range of emotions for a basically undeveloped character.  Michelle Rodriguez overdoes the tough girl part, but is effective nonetheless.  Eric Mabius gives Matt both a tough and sensitive edge, and redeems himself for BLACK CIRCLE BOYS.  Martin Crewes as Caplan is quite good, as is James Purefoy (A Knight's Tale) in the role of Jovovich's undercover lover.  The monster dogs, zombies, laser killer and chief monster are all well done, and the movie's apocalyptic ending certainly leaves room for the upcoming sequel.<br /><br />I enjoyed this much better than MORTAL KOMBAT, so I'm looking forward to the sequel.</p></body></html>

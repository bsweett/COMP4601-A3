<meta name="summary" content="Original, Endearing and Very Funny"></head><body><p>Peculiar, original, strange and bending towards the darker areas of the comedy genre, this art house film turned popular hit, is full of pleasant surprises with equally sad moments made hilarious.<br /><br />There are two aspects about this film that has made it a great film, and that is its talented cast and off beat soundtrack due to the combined contributions of Mychael Danna and DeVotchka. The music adds to the film's originality and certainly is the right "tone" to the many pitfalls and basic bad luck that this dysfunctional family experience while on the road to California to have the youngest, Olive Hoover, compete in the Little Miss Sunshine contest.<br /><br />What is extraordinary is that all the characters are so different in personality and sensibility, the strongest being the cocaine snorting grandpa, (Alan Arkin) and the most unusual, Dwayne, (Paul Dano) a disciplined boy who reads Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher, has taken a vow of silence, (more to escape from having to engage with his strange family) and goal to be jet pilot. At the end of the film we see that he is not as strange as we first thought. Of course, Toni Collette as the mother manages to somehow keep her family together despite their ecentricities and the many mishaps that befall them: a wonderful and restrained performance.<br /><br />Although excellent performances by the entire cast, Olive, (Abigail Breslin) stole the show as Little Miss Sunshine, realistic and endearing, the end of the film, her dance number truly stole the show.<br /><br />Having heard so much positive talk about Little Miss Sunshine to finally see it, all expectations were met as it is original and very funny.<br /><br />4.5 stars.</p></body></html>

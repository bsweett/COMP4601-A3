It is the fattest book, but the movie is approximately the same length as the others, so even more is left out than usual. Having said that, it is still a good movie, a very good movie. It's just a frustration to the fans of the books, but it's marvelous for those who have never read them.<br /><br />Unlike the first three movies, we do not start with the Dursleys. Harry is visiting at the Burrow (Weasley's place), and has a dream about Voldemort, Wormtail, and someone who is clearly a younger follower of Voldemort whom Harry does not recognize. When he wakes up, it is to Hermione shaking him awake so they can get ready for their trip to the Quidditch World Cup. This is the first we learn there is a Quidditch World Cup, and that there are other schools of magic besides Hogwarts. There is Durmstrang (quite Prussian in style) and there is Beaubatons (decidedly French).<br /><br />But we don't get to see the World Cup at all, just the opening ceremonies that glorify the Bulgarian seeker, Viktor Krum. Next thing you know it is over, and suddenly the grounds are aflame through the marching violence of the Death Eaters. (Readers of the book know just how very much more there is to this.) The same young man who was in Harry's dream serving Voldemort conjures the Dark Mark into the sky. (No Winky; no house elves at all in this episode.)<br /><br />We no sooner get to Hogwarts than the Beaubatons carriage and the Durmstrang sailing ship appear, apparently on the first day of school. There are only girls (not a word about veela) in the Beaubatons contingent, and only boys in the Durmstrang group. Including, of course, Viktor Krum.<br /><br />Rita Skeeter is there, annoying as ever, but nothing is ever said about her being an unregistered anamagus. She just delivers her lies and half-truths to the Daily Prophet and infuriates Harry and Hermione, whom she insists on linking romantically. Hermione's beautiful revenge is altogether missing, which is a great pity.<br /><br />But we do have the Yule Ball, and Ron's ghastly antique dress robes, and Padme and Parvati Patil, and all the jealousies mentioned in the book. They managed to get all that in, no matter what else was left out. (Grrrrrr!)<br /><br />And of course we have the Triwizard Tournament. That story is told rather like the way it was in the book, although the problems encountered in the maze are way over-simplified. No blast-end skrewts, no Sphinx, mostly just weird vegetable matter and the imperious curse on Krum. And of course the trophy cup is a port key. But I won't spoil the rest. The story is basically the same from here out.<br /><br />So try not to mourn for the missing parts, and enjoy the movie. It does have complexity, in spite of all that cutting, and as a movie, it's pretty darn good.</p></body></html>

Tapping into the global paranoia of a post 9/11 world, the story acts as both a standard political thriller and a rallying call for peace through better communication. The screenplay was written by Charles Randolph, Scott Frank, and Steven Zaillian.<br /><br />When Silvia Broome, an interpreter for the United Nations, overhears a conversation concerning a plot to kill a controversial political leader from Africa, she is thrust into a dangerous world of international intrigue. When she reports what she's heard, no one believes her. When a government agent named Tobin Keller is assigned to uncover the validity of the potential threat, he at first disbelieves Silvia's story... until she herself becomes a target. Then Tobin, who recently lost his wife in an automobile accident, begins to bond with Silvia, who herself has a tragic past and is very familiar with loss. As it becomes clear that there really is a plot, Tobin and Silvia must rely on one another in order to find out who is behind the conspiracy. But the more that Tobin learns of Silvia's past the more apparent it becomes that it was no coincidence that she overheard the conversation to begin with. Is Silvia involved in the plot or was she targeted from the start? And can Tobin protect her from the many dangers that they now face?<br /><br />The film stars Nicole Kidman as Silvia Broome and Sean Penn as Tobin Keller. The supporting cast is filled out by Catherine Keener, Jesper Christensen, Yvan Attal, Earl Cameron, George Harris, Hugo Speer, and Curits l'Cook. Director Pollack also has an uncredited role as Chief Jay Pettigrew. The entire cast gives great performances, and Kidman, in particular, gives a powerful sense of loss and moral confusion.<br />While the film may not be Pollack's most impressive directorial effort, it is a remarkable written and acted film with some surprising twists. Unlike most thrillers of this kind, the two main characters never consummate their relationship in a sexual manner. Instead the screenplay allows Kidman and Penn to give subtle performances with nuance and believability. What makes The Interpreter so suspenseful is that we, as an audience, are given time to become emotionally invested in the characters as they are tested emotionally, physically, and morally.<br />Also adding to the believability of the film is the fact that many scenes were actually shot at the United Nations, which had never before allowed a commercial film to shoot within their walls. So in a way, Sydney Pollack has made movie history by earning permission to film there.<br /><br />The DVD includes an alternate ending, deleted scenes, Sydney Pollack at Work: From Concept to Cutting Room featurette, Interpreting Pan & Scan vs. Widescreen featurette, The Ultimate Movie Set: The United Nations featurette, and an insightful audio commentary by Pollack.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000IRE6">Nick of Time</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F12J0C">The Bourne Trilogy</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JN2Z">Collateral</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHQUOE">Crash</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BYA5GO">Lord of War</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F7CMRM">Syriana</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C65Z1G">The Constant Gardener</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIVJF4">The Last King of Scotland</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SQFC18">Babel</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00121QGPY">Michael Clayton</a></p></body></html>

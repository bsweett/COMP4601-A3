<meta name="summary" content="The Best Film I've Seen Thus Far This Year"></head><body><p>"There Will Be Blood" is one of the few films made in recent years that will be long remembered for something more than raking in bucks or featuring the latest flavor of the month topless.  That is to say, it's an instant classic.  Shot with a lyrical confidence that evokes both Bernardo Bertolucci's "1900" and Terrence Malick's "Days of Heaven," it nonetheless firmly establishes its own identity, and if "Boogie Nights" or "Punch-Drunk Love" alone haven't convinced people that Paul Thomas Anderson is the most interesting American director working today, this film certainly should.  Loosely based on Upton Sinclair's "Oil" (but really having as much to do with "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre," with a little "Chinatown" and "Citizen Kane" thrown in), the tragic drama stars Daniel Day-Lewis, perhaps the greatest British actor of his generation, as Daniel Plainview, an obsessive, sociopathic robber baron who in the first scene literally wills himself back to life and crawls across a desert not so much to safety, but to cash in his haul of silver.  Those first five minutes tell us everything we need to know about this character, who will go from bad to worse to worse yet in a depiction of unbridled greed that is refreshing in its brutal honesty.  In a country where greed is so often depicted in film as divinely ordained, Plainview will seem a theatrical canard to those who catch glimpses of themselves in him, or in his like-minded foil, the duplicitous Reverend Sunday (played with effete menace by Paul Dano).  Though Day-Lewis' portrayal sometimes threatens caricature of actor/director John Huston (whose fine works include "Treasure of the Sierra Madre"), and there seems to be an act missing before the disturbing but inevitable climax of the film, it's tough to find any real flaws in the work, whose raw soundtrack by Radiohead's Johnny Greenwood is often as relentless as Plainview himself.  If I have one wish for Paul Thomas Anderson, it's that he resist Hollywood overtures to make the next tinny summer blockbuster or moronic Christmas comedy and instead keep plugging away -- he's on course to go down in history as one of America's truly great filmmakers.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Five Stars for the First 60 Minutes, One Star for the Ending"></head><body><p>"Law Abiding Citizen" stars Gerald Butler ("300") as Clyde Shelton, a genius engineer living in Philadelphia, whose wife and daughter are brutally murdered. The criminals Clarence and Rupert are caught, and the trial begins, but the prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) informs the distraught father that only Rupert will be sentenced to death. Clarence (with whom Nick strikes a deal) will be convicted of third-degree murder, which means in a few years he will be released from the jail.<br /><br />You may call "Law Abiding Citizen" a revenge thriller, but this time the angry protagonist avenges the deaths of his family in the most unpredictable (and brutal) fashion. He is not content with just killing; he intends to bring down the entire legal system of the country. That means Nick and those who are working with him (including Nick's mentor Jonas Cantrell played by Bruce McGill) are not safe ... even after Clyde is arrested.<br /><br />Like his "The Negotiator" F. Gary Gray starts with a great premise, keeps a good pace in the mid-section, and then ends disappointingly, squandering the potential of the intriguing story. I know I shouldn't disclose the ending (don't worry, I won't), but frankly, the last 20 minutes are so impossible (even by the standards of Hollywood movies) that I still cannot believe what I have seen.<br /><br />I like Gerald Butler. I like this kind of "vigilante" film. As for "Law Abiding Citizen," however, four(or maybe five) stars for the first 60 minutes, one star for the ending.</p></body></html>

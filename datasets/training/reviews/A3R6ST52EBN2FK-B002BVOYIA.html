<meta name="summary" content="Oscar worthy performance by Don Cheadle"></head><body><p>A hotel manager houses Tutsis refugees during their conflict with the Hutu militia.  Heartwrenching performances and the overall message of bravery and courage were defined clearly by Mr. Don Cheadle.  There is a definite lesson in this movie about giving of oneself and the testament of the human spirit.  High recommend.</p></body></html>

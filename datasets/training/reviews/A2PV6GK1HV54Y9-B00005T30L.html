Thora Birch is a great actress and she's good in this unique indie film but the plot and ending leaves the audience with many unanswered questions. Steve Buscemi and Scarlett Johansson also star and the late Brad Renfro. Ghost World is based on a comic book, so expect a dark comedy. Wish I liked this film more but it is just ok for me.</p></body></html>

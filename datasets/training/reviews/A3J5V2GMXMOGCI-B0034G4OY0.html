<meta name="summary" content="A very crisp blu-ray strictly for those that believe in ghosts - Boo!"></head><body><p>Eastwood's tabloid take on the afterlife is just as trite as his sports movie about soccer; his bright, white-light scenario is Weekly World News material.  It is not hard to see executive producer Spielberg's schmaltzy wishful thinking pervading this childish excursion into the phenomenon of psychic silliness.  There is an audience pleasing tsunami sequence at the outset; but all hope of ongoing insights are flushed away just like the tropical tourist trap.  It might work as a fantasy for adolescents, although they are unlikely to tolerate anything this slow, let alone subtitled sequences.  Uh oh, gotta go, Mommy is yelling at me from heaven for giving this a bad review!</p></body></html>

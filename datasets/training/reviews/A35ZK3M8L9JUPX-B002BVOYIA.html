<meta name="summary" content="Hotel Rwanda"></head><body><p>Ten years ago, as the country of Rwanda descended into madness, one man made a promise to protect the family he loved--and ended up finding the courage to save over 1200 people. Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager in Rwanda, secretly used his position and intelligence to shelter over a thousand refugees during the genocide crisis. Cheadle is great in this movie. A very moving and powerful movie.</p></body></html>

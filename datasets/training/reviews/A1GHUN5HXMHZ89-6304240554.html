<meta name="summary" content="Dawn of the Dead"></head><body><p>I doubt most of todays audience will appreciate this as much as those that saw it at the theater, but it still has a cult following for good reason. George A. Romero was the master at Zombie movies. Sure the makeup job on this could have been better but considering his budget for his B movies, he did remarkably well. This is one of my favorites with the shopping mall as their hideout from the dead. The remake is pretty good too, but you have to see this original to fully appreciate it. Good quality DVD with extras. If you enjoyed this catch "Day of the Dead".<br /><br />CA Luster</p></body></html>

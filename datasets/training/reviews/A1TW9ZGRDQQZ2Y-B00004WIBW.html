<meta name="summary" content="One of Tim Burton's most visually striking films"></head><body><p>Sleepy Hollow is just a great looking movie that deserves a DVD play at least once a year in October. This is one of the ultimate Halloween movies. It features spooky sets, one of Danny Elfman's best music scores, enough gore to make Sweeney Todd proud and the visual touches of Tim Burton. The acting is good all around, with no one standing out from the crowd. I like Johnny Depp in this, but it's not one of his best performances. As a whole, Sleepy Hollow is my favorite flick from this director and it has been since I first saw it in theaters back in 1999.</p></body></html>

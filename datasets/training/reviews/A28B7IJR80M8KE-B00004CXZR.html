<meta name="summary" content="I knew there had to be a reason for this films delay on DVD"></head><body><p>Unlike many, I think this is a neat &quot;Star Trek&quot; movie, my only problem with this first film is the special effects which seem dated compared to the ones that followed, now this one has received full DVD treatment which i hope will be better, the special effects are supposed to be revamped to today's standards, lets hope so, because if so i will likely buy this DVD. if measured to the later films as far as effects go.</p></body></html>

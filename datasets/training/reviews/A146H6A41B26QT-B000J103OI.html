<meta name="summary" content="Thoroughly enjoyable"></head><body><p>"The Devil Wears Prada" is the familiar story of the innocent in the jungle (business, Wall Street, journalism, fashion,etc.) who achieves success but realizes true values lie elsewhere. Anne Hathaway plays the unstylish, clumsy Andrea who improbably lands a job with Miranda Priestly, played brilliantly by Meryl Streep. Andrea fixes herself up and is smart enough to figure out what Miranda wants, and she finds herself promoted over the senior assistant. In the process, however, Andrea loses boyfriend and friends, as the job becomes all-consuming. In the end, Andrea gives it all up for a "real" job in journalism, and wins her long-suffering man back.<br /><br />The real star here is Streep, who plays Miranda with icy coldness, except for one breathaking scene where she finds out that her husband wants a divorce. The other star is the clothes--sexy, frivolous, sleek and stylish--Hathaway looks great after her makeover. The story is predictable, but no matter--it's totally enjoyable.</p></body></html>

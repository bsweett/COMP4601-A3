<meta name="summary" content="Best Sci-Fi Film in a Long Time"></head><body><p>Others may,or may not agree,but I think this is the best sci-fi film to come along in a long while. Despite some of it's short commings(this is not an oscar winner by any means) it is still entertaining to the last.<br /><br /> The Riddick Chronicals by far surpass in quality what George Lucas has been attempting to do  with his newest Star Wars franchise.Instead of the film being all about special effects,it mearly uses them as part of the canvas to paint the environment and set the scene.<br /><br /> The last Star Wars film was so utterly pathetic in dialog&plot,all the best digital effects ILM provided could'nt help save that dog from drowning.I don't care what the film grossed in the U.S,or overseas...it was a terrible film.Reading the Sunday Funnies is far more entertaining.Sorry George,but despite me being an avid sci-fi fan&Star Wars junkie in my younger years,your last two films barely pass for movies of the week.<br /><br /> The Riddick Chronicals keeps up a good pace,great action, and the special effects don't interfere with the story.Riddick is an exceedingly interesting character with more room to grow&develope,as well as the the Necromongers being an evil&and aggressive race on a quest to covert people of alien worlds to their beliefs,or be anihalated.It kind of mirrors some of our current events happening accross the globe.<br /><br /> There is suppose to be some more films to follow this one,and I can only hope they keep the momentum going.It will be interesting to see what lies in store for Riddick, and where the storyline goes.I  am looking forward for the next film.I highly reccommend this film, if you have'nt seen Pitch Black, you should see it before seeing the Riddick Chronicles.Whether you are a Sci-Fi fan,a Vin Diesel fan, or not...you will not be disapointed.</p></body></html>

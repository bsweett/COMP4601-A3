To me the magical aspect of the Harry Potter series is a vital addition to the storytelling.  It really enhances the feeling of adventure.  I'm happy to report that it's back again, thankfully.<br /><br />As expected by the title of the film alone, it's about Lord Voldemort attempting to officially capture and rid the world of Harry Potter once and for all.  Will he succeed?  That's definitely not for me to spoil, hehe.<br /><br />The setting is quite the surprise as well.  Harry Potter and his friends almost never step foot inside a castle which makes the movie feel different, but not in a distracting kind of way or anything.  Most of the adventure takes places outside in the empty forests or occasionally in the city streets.  A major part of the storyline is on Harry Potter and the gang being cloned into lookalike Harry Potter's and being able to disappear whenever signs of danger present themselves (which is pretty much the norm by this point but used to great effect this time around).<br /><br />Some of my favorite scenes are when Harry Potter was outside in the dark woods by himself and he spots a glowing, mystical deer walking around.  To me this was a *beautiful* moment of creativity.  Another really fascinating and bizarre moment of viewing material (and storytelling for that matter) came later when the story surrounding Death takes place and how Death tricks people into being loyal through conniving ways.  It's actually a very interesting story and even someone like me who normally daydreams through such moments was paying close attention and enjoying it.  Good writing.<br /><br />Overall, great acting by all the characters like always, beautiful sceneries, magical superpowers dominate, good suspense and storyline development come together to create an entertaining chapter in the Harry Potter films.</p></body></html>

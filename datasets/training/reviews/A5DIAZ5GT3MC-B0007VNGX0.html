<meta name="summary" content=""Resident Evil: Apocalypse" Review!"></head><body><p>Coming off the turkey that was "Alien Vs. Predator", Paul W.S. Anderson swings and misses again with another script full of awful dialouge and cardboard characters. Anderson hands over the directing honors to Alexander Witt on this one but it doesn't make too much of a difference. Witt soaks the film in stylized violence and over-produced CGI but unfortunately, such items as "substance" and "content" were thrown on the back-burner, this time around.<br /><br />Starting where the original "Resident" left off, "Apocalypse" has Milla Jovovich's Alice trapped in a zombie plague that has engulfed the fictional Racoon City. Along the way she meets up with female rogue cop Jill Valentine, her partner, and a news reporter. Of course, a representitive of the evil Umbrella Corp. is behind it all. To make matters worse, he throws a genetically-enchanced creature called "Nemesis" into the mix. If the cartoonish super-villian subplot about a corporate honcho who fiendishly sacrifices innocent people for the sake of a major advancement in weaponry has ever see more played out and cheesy than it is here, I have yet to see it.<br /><br />While "Apocalypse" plays out like a mix of "Charlie's Angels" and the "Dawn Of The Dead" remake, it certainly doesn't stop there. It kindly borrows its plot twists and even lifts dialouge from other films as well.While the original film was a promising video game adaption, this sequel is a series of pretty pictures wrapped up in a meaningless story. For all of its influences, you'd think at the very least that "Apocalypse" would make for a decent homage. Sadly, that isn't the case. The treatment of the zombie mytholgy is flimsy and the story feels like it would be better suited for a Saturday morning cartoon series adaption of the movie then a sequel. For all of its faults, if you're looking for a big mindless celebration of action and violence with cheesy dialouge and little of anything else, this could be your cup of tea.</p></body></html>

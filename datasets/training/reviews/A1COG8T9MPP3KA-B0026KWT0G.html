<meta name="summary" content="Am I The Only Reviewer Who Likes the Opening Theme Song?"></head><body><p>First let me say this film is very nostalgic to me. I was fortunate enough to see it in its original theatrical 3-D release. I remember the credits coming out at you in 3-D. As a kid, It was a thrill for me, scary and exciting. Part 3 is my favorite film out of  11 Jason films. I had read this was the most profitable 3-D theatrical release ever. That may have changed with the new onslaught of 3-D movies. While we are at it, My Bloody Valentine 3D was loads of fun!<br />I almost fell out of my chair when I read this Friday the 13th was being released as a special version. I went out immediately and bought it. I must say this DVD must be making some money because many stores had sold out of it, but had plenty of the other 2 special releases in stock. I finally snagged the last copy from Best Buy.<br />My favorite part of the film was the 3-D opening credits. I am even one of those rare birds that dig the theme song. I even own the theme song. It was written by Harry Manfredini under the name of Hot Ice.<br />I am really let down by the opening credits not being in 3-D. Why? I cannot understand this glaring omission. I skimmed through the movie to see how effective the 3-D effects were.<br />Here is a rundown of some of the effects (but not all of them):<br /><br />The first noticeable effect was the laundry pole being handled by Harold. It literally came out right in front of my face. Excellent.<br /><br />The snake in the rabbit cage. Not so good. I saw 2 snakes. (there should only be one)<br /><br />Passing the joint in the van: again I saw double vision here. Not so good.<br /><br />The bum holding the eyeball up to the camera. This time it worked excellent.<br /><br />Lifting the hay into the barn and the hay swaying back and forth on the rope was good. Again this worked great. The depth was excellent, almost dizzying.<br /><br />The fist through the car glass. Not so good.<br /><br />The yo-yo scene: the first part wasn't working but the last few swings really did came straight out of the screen.<br /><br />The gas siphon scene seemed to have perfect clarity and amazing depth. The whole film should have looked like this.<br /><br />The two thugs getting a pitchfork in the barn. Only average here. Could have been better. But the pitchfork handle did come out of the screen.<br /><br />The juggling scene. It was effective. Not bad but not great. The room depth was good here.<br /><br />Kris telling about her encounter with Jason. Her head seemed to float around while the story played in the background behind her. This was good. I don't even remember this scene being in 3-D.<br /><br />The harpoon in the eye scene did not seem to work to well for me. I tried it several times. This was suppose to be the highlight effect of the film. It just happened so fast.<br /><br />The popcorn worked. I think it would work better on a bigger screen.<br /><br />The hippy getting electrocuted; the sparks flew out of the screen, very cool.<br /><br />Effects that did not work. The female hippy with the fire poker through her. And the boy doing the hand stand and getting a machete in his hoo hoo, neither of these had much effect.<br /><br />The eyeball popping out of the head. This was funny, because when the eyeball pops out, you can hear a horn beep. Like a horn at the end of a joke by Groucho Marx. I don't remember the horn noise LOL. Oh and yes the eyeball scene worked very well.<br /><br />Other minor effects: Jason throws a knife at Chris. Jason plummets through the front porch and grabs at Kris.<br /><br />Jason being hung. This worked well as far as the depth. The rope seemed to be on the outside of the screen.<br /><br />Jason getting the meat cleaver in the head and putting his hands out to the camera. Worked excellent, very exciting!<br /><br />All in all it is kind of a headache watching this thing. But I thought the sound was of a much better quality than the earlier Friday Part 3 DVD I have. I really didn't get the ending where Jason's mother pops up out of the water, but hey what part of the movie is realistic anyway? I am glad to have this. Maybe we will get a better version with the opening credits.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Warm-Hearted  Magical Christmas Fantasy"></head><body><p>Tom Hanks dominates this lively, warm, and sweet animated feature, based on the 1985 Caldecott Medal winning book of the same name by Chris  Van Allsburg.<br />  We travel to a home in a snow-filled suburb of Michigan one Christmas Eve, where a young boy on the verge of adolescence lies in bed, hoping to hear the sound of Santa's sleigh bells. His parents (voiced by Tom Hanks and Leslie Zemeckis) check on him and his sister, Sarah (Leslie Zemeckis/Ashly Holloway). But as logic, reasoning, and concrete proof are becoming more essential to the young lad, he has reason to doubt that he will hear the bells; his World Book Encyclopedias tell him the North Pole is a barren wasteland where life cannot be sustained, therefore, no place for Santa to have a toy facory. He has a newspaper story about striking department store Santas, and a copy of Norman Rockwell's painting, "The Discovery", featuring a child discovering his father's Santa Claus suit.<br />  Soon enough, there is a mysterious rumbling outside his house. Clad only in his pajamas, robe, and slippers, our Hero Boy wanders out into the snow to investigate. In so doing, he is confronted by an enormous train called The Polar Express, and a conductor urging him to get on.<br />  Reluctantly, he does so, and as a smiling snowman waves in the distance, he is off.<br />  He encounters a group of children in one of the cars, clad only in nightclothes like himself despite the cold. Another little boy(voiced by Peter Scolari) is hesitant to get on, and almost misses the train. Once aboard, he remains by himself in a dark box car.<br /> The Hero Boy becomes better acquainted with his fellow passengers. The most prominent of these are the Know-It-All (voiced by the Eternal Nerd, Eddie Deezen, who is very much in his element), and  the Hero Girl (Nona Gaye), the latter of whom expresses a motherly concern for the Lonely Boy, whose name we learn is Billy.<br />  The children are entertained by the waiters who treat them to an amusing performance while serving hot chocolate.<br /> During the heart of the journey, the children engage in various acts of kindness and civility towards each other, and the Lonely Boy is made to feel more and more included. At one point, a train ticket goes astray and has an interesting journey of its own.<br /> The conductor, Hero Boy and Hero Girl deal with goofy engineers (voiced by the late Michael Jeter, to whom the film is lovingly dedicated), and a dangerous jaunt down an exteremely steep slope.<br />  The Hero Boy has periodic encounters with  a mysterious Hobo(also voiced by Hanks) who confronts him about his lack of faith in Santa, but does help him save a life.<br /> The conductor comes up with an unorthodox way of getting a herd of caribou blocking the train out of the way, and the Hero Boy and Hero Girl view a car filled with damaged toys and are exposed to the concept of recycling.<br />  In the meantime, the Lonely Boy watches the night and begins to sing a wistful carol which becomes more hopeful-sounding when the Hero Girl joins in. Soon, the four main characters are treated to a viewing of the Northern Lights as they approach their destination.<br /> The Christmas City is lively and full of light. The children are surrounded by a multitude of elves, and the three children on whom the story focuses break away from the others after disembarking.<br /> Amid an array of Christmas carols from the 1940s and '50s (in marvelous counterpoint to Alan Silvestri's glorious score), the three observe the inner workings of Santa's toy factory, watching the elves as they monitor the behavior of children all over the world.<br />  Traveling in a tube-like vehicle, as they saw the elves do, they find their way to a conveyer belt where Billy finds a gift with his name and address. But soon the children and  the gift are dumped into the bag on Santa's sleigh. The Know-It-All is found among the packages as well.<br />  To the strains of "Santa Claus is Coming to Town", sung by a young Frank Sinatra, Santa Claus appears, and the crowd of elves and children go wild with delight.<br />  From his position in the crowd, the Hero Boy cannot see Santa. A bell  falls off of the sleigh's reindeer harness and the Hero Boy picks it up, listening for the jingle and trying to believe with all his might. Of all the children in attendance, Santa selects him to receive the first gift of Christmas before taking off to deliver the gifts.<br /> Watch for a fun cameo by Steve Tyler as an Elf Lieutenant and Elf Singer!<br /> Soon, the children are homeward bound, and the conductor punches a special message of either praise or suggestions for improvement into each of their tickets.<br />  The Hero Boy discovers the harness bell missing, and he is as disappointed about that as Billy was about relinquishing his gift to an elf.<br />  But the magic that both felt had slipped away, is indeed reclaimed on Christmas Day--a theme touched upon the the film's beautiful closing anthem, warmly and soronously sung by Josh Grobin.<br />  While the story focuses on the magic and myths of Christmastime, the Hero Boy and his family are presumably going to attend a church service that day. We learn that as he gets older, the Hero Boy gradually becomes the only one who can hear the sleigh bell.<br /> I wish those on Amazon a fond Christmas 2006, and may we always enjoy the sweetness of the sleigh bells!</p></body></html>

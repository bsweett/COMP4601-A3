I was surprised with what the movie was like, and just as surprised that it wasn't what I thought it would be. What do I mean?. I was expecting the movie to be pretty raunchy and over the top along the lines of more recent comedy fare. It wasn't. Don't get me wrong, it does get a little nutty with some R rated material, but it wasn't like it is in other raunchier comedies. I was also surprised that it was a nicer film with more heart than I was expecting. It's still an R rated film all the way though. It took me a while to laugh because the movie doesn't really get funny until 45 minutes into the film. Once they crash the big wedding and hook up with the girls and their family, then it starts becoming funny. Just wait. It'll come. I was also never a real fan of either Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn, but I liked them a great deal here and will keep an open mind about them from now on. The two star as a couple of friends who, come wedding season, crash the festivities to have a good time, eat good food, drink good wine, and possibly bed some women. They get into more than they can handle when they attend the wedding of the daughter of the Secretary of Treasury(Christopher Walken). John(Owen) meets Claire(Rachel McAdams), the middle daughter, and Jeremy(Vince) meets Gloria, the youngest daughter, who's a few sandwiches short of a picnic. In what becomes very predictable, John actually falls for Claire, who is with a rich creep(also very predictable), and Jeremy tries to flee from the crazy Gloria. The movie is basically very routine. You know what will happen the second it starts, and you know how it will all play out in the end. The movie offers no real surprises, but it makes up for it in plenty to laugh at, fun performances, and a slick direction. Christopher Walken is a god, but he has nothing to really do here. He just seems to be there to be the "dad" looming over the happenings and keep everyone together. Plus, it seems kinda strange to me to see Walken being the "dad". Jane Seymour has a fun little role that plays against what we usually get from her. She also looks fantastic!. McAdams is as sweet as apple pie and looks even better. I can see why she is supposed to be the next big thing. You can't stop looking at her. Bradley Cooper from "Alias" is only there as a cliched and predictable plot tool. Our two stars?. Both carry the film very well. They work and play off of each other nicely. Vaughn has a knack for this kind of comedy and character, but Wilson doesn't match him quite as well. The big cameo towards the end is fun, and it would be a hoot to see a film about that character!. Dwight Yoakam and Rebecca DeMornay also appear in quick cameos at the very beginning. The ending can be seen a mile away, but it doesn't lessen how nice it is. Wedding Crashers is not perfect, nor is it as side splitting funny as other films, but it is fun, funny, and very enjoyable. Not bad at all.</p></body></html>

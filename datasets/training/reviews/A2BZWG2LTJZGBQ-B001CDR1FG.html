<meta name="summary" content="overlong and way too serious"></head><body><p>The Hulk is a bad movie.  It has all the necessary elements to be good, but instead it goes awry in a number of ways.  The special effects are good, but overused, the cast is effective, but campy.  The story follows the original in a way, but doesn't realize that the material needs to be lighter in nature.  In short, this is a misfire that results from everything being just a little off.<p>David Banner (Nick Nolte) has a son, Bruce whom he injects with a chemical he is working on that is supposed to allow him to fix himself when hurt or regenerate limbs he loses.  Later, he is fired from his job in the military, and sets off a nuclear explosion.  His son is home and survives the blast.  Later he is exposed to a large amount of gamma radiation and develops the ability to turn into the hulk when provoked to great anger.<p>There's much to get upset about.  His ex girlfriend (Jennifer Connoley) still works with him in the lab (he does the same thing his father used to do)  Her father (Sam Elliott) was the man who fired David all those years ago.  Now he wants to use the Hulk as a military weapon.  Throw in Josh Lucas as a two fold jerk.  He not only wants to date Connoley, but he wants to use the DNA of the Hulk to develop his own creature for his company.<p>The CGI version of the Hulk is almost humorously campy.  He leaps all over the place and destroys buildings like they're not even there.  This would not be so bad if it were not so obvious that it is fake.  I will give the creature this.  It looks more like a mutant than the original series, which simply featured Lou Ferrigno with green paint.  The problem comes from the fake look of the action.  Also, director Ang Lee looks at this material all wrong.  Instead of it being a fun, entertaining look at a fantasy hero, this film is sullen and serious.  Nick Nolte's speech at the end is so over the top it's amazing.  Lee's previous &quot;Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon&quot; could have been more serious, but ended up being light and amusing.  This is awful.  Compare it to SpiderMan and you'll see what I mean.<p>Finally, the movie is way too long.  This should have been 100 minutes tops, not 140.  It takes us 45 minutes to meet the Hulk.  Why show us a helicopter flying Bruce to the lab for 3-4 minutes?  I'm serious.  The helicopter just flies along.  Why?  At 100 minutes this would have been tight and watchable.  As it is, you'll barely make it to the finish.  The Hulk could have been really good.  Hopefully the sequel (I'm sure there will be one) will understand the shortcomings of the original and get it right.</p></body></html>

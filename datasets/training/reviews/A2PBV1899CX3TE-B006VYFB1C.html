Really it was about money, and how money impacts the game and how you could use a different approach to picking players that would overcome the disadvantage of having less money then other clubs, like The Yankees.<br /><br />Brad Pitt gave a great performance as General Manager of the under financed Oakland A's, Billy Beane. He passed up a full scholarship to Stanford for a career as a player in Major League Baseball, but it didn't work out and throughput the film pivotal moments are illuminated by flashbacks of his dashed hopes. Pitt conveys the frustrations and determination of Beane, a true maverick trying to cut against the grain of Major League Baseball. I rank this performance right up there with Fight Club for Mr. Pitt.<br /><br />While trying to bag some players from the Cleveland Indians Billy Beane spots a talented analyst, a composite character named Peter Brand. The Cleveland management doesn't appreciate the young firebrand's ideas, but Beane knows talent when he sees it. He asks if perhaps he is someone's nephew, but finds that it is Brand's first job, not only in baseball, but his very first job of any sort since graduating from Yale with a degree in Economics. Jonah Hill was nominated for a well deserved supporting actor Oscar for his performance--an understated, dead pan performance that is still quite funny, but doesn't undercut the drama.<br /><br />Phillip Seymour Hoffman blended into his role as A's coach Art Howe so well that I didn't even recognize him. Also notable was Kerris Dorsey as Billy's daughter Casey Beane. I recognized her from the TV drama Brothers  & Sisters. Finally, Chris Pratt, from TV comedy Parks & Recreation, was outstanding in his field as Scott Hatteberg, one of the underrated players, chosen for his ability to get on base--even if he has to walk to get there. All the supporting cast rang very true, like it was a documentary but with better lighting.<br /><br />The movie grabbed me right from the beginning and wouldn't let go, even though I am not really much of a baseball fan. Like the people it depicts, this film was a real game changer. It was the first baseball film to be nominated for best picture since Field of Dreams 22 years ago.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Macho Action to the Extreme"></head><body><p>This movie has a really cool base plot, over-the-top special effects, and an ending that is nearly plausible.  The pacing of the movie is so fast that you tend to forget that the movie is full of far too convenient coincidences and more lucky breaks than any one race should deserve.  Regardless of how many times I have seen this movie, I am always up for one more.<br /><br />Our main characters see some strange things at the beginning of the movie.  It turns out that the strange things are aliens entering our atmosphere.  The generation that grew up with "E.T." and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" decides that the best thing to do is to say hello to the new neighbors.  However, it appears that our alien visitors are more akin to the aliens of "Starship Troopers" than to E.T.  We eventually learn that the aliens have two things in mind; our extermination and the rape of our planet.<br /><br />However, because we have lots of macho, manly, men running about, we are not going to wait for the aliens to exterminate us.  We have President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman, who has had a number of experiences with a variety of creatures, such as reptiles in "Lake Placid," scary dead people in "The Grudge," ghosts in "Casper," and Sandra Bullock in "While You Were Sleeping"), David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum, who managed to hold dinosaurs at bay with biting wit in two "Jurassic Park" movies), Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith, who has more macho in his little finger than most guys in their whole body), General William Grey (Robert Loggia, who just exudes macho, in a grandfatherly sort of way) and Russell Casse (Randy Quaid, who has lots of macho, it's just hard to find), along with a cast of hundreds of other macho people (including some women) who gamely sacrifice themselves to beat off the alien attack.<br /><br />Things initially look pretty hopeless.  The aliens have a game play and they are sticking to it.  Everything looks like they are on a tight schedule, and the aliens smack our high tech equipment as though they were gnats, and ignore nuclear weapons as though they were nothing more than a brief puff of wind.  Ah, but we know something the aliens do not.  Well, a couple of somethings.  First, we have all the macho, manly, men.  Second, we have a spacecraft that crashed in Roswell, and it is kept in the place that does not really exist, Area 51.<br /><br />How can we combine the two things that we have and end up with an alien exterminating play?  Well, it helps to have wise Julius Levinson (Judd Hirsch, who has little alien experience), David's father.  An amazingly simple statement by Julius suddenly triggers a brilliant thought in David, and bingo, a solution to the alien problem is created.  Of course, we need aspiring astronaut Captain Steve Hiller to fly the spacecraft to the alien mother ship so that David's computer (with homage to HAL-9000 on it) can talk to the alien computer.  They also are carrying a nuclear missile to attempt to wreak a little havoc on the alien mother ship.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is aerial battles and a huge self-sacrifice that makes you want to salute an American flag somewhere.<br /><br />This movie is full of corn and coincidence, and yet it is darn fun to watch.  The action is so fast that you rarely have a chance to think too much about the numerous coincidences, or that your emotions are being deliberately manipulated.  Unless you spend too much time analyzing movies, especially science fiction movies, and you like a lot of action, then I think you would absolutely love this movie.</p></body></html>

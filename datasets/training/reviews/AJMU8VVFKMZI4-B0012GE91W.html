<meta name="summary" content="I loved the movie more than the book"></head><body><p>I know that statement is going to get a rash of non-helpful votes.  But the fifth book in the Hp series, while good, did have a lot of annoying things happening.  The main one being Harry being such a snot to his friends.  I know the reasoning, but the angry teenager just rubbed me the wrong way.  I like that his isolation and his frustration was there but didn't drag across the entire film.  Ron and Hermoine are getting less and less screen time, but that's fine, too.  Especially since Daniel seems to be the only one willing to improve his acting chops.  Really, it was almost too painful to watch Emma Watson wooden performance.  Draco Malfoy was another character who's part was noticable absent.  But as a film, unless I want to spend the entire day planted in a theater seat, things have to be cut.  Adaptations are all dwindled down and one shouldn't be running to see movie five without having read the series anyway, so you know the details.  For the money and the entertainment value, I think this was the best movie to date.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Perfect Christmas Gift For Any Prince or Princess"></head><body><p>Disney's classic fairy tale SLEEPING BEAUTY is timeless.  It is as lovely today as it was in 1959.  Full of warmth, saturated colors, and an enduring story, SLEEPING BEUATY continues to enchant princesses of all ages.<br /><br />We purchased this DVD for my three year old as a Christmas gift, but could not resist a sneak peak at Grandma and PawPaw's house over Thanksgiving.  The animation was stellar in 1959, and I must say, it certainly holds its own against any animation of today.  The vibrancy, detail, and charm still capture the imagination, submerging the viewer the fairy tale world.  The story itself is eternal:  good triumphs over evil and love, true love, concurs all.  The music is a perfect accompaniment to the tale, and "Once Upon A Dream" ranks up there as one of the all time best Disney songs.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed watching this with my two girls and the rest of my family.  It was a beautiful way for the entire family to spend a small part of Thanksgiving week doing something memorable together.  I was surprised about how much of this movie I did not remember from when I saw it 40 years ago, and I was surprised how much detail my 11 year old remembered from the first time she saw it.  The three year old was simply enchanted by the entire movie; from the fairies to Princess Aurora.  She was enraptured the magic and the majesty of the story.<br /><br />I highly recommend this dvd as a treat for the entire family.  Little ones, teens, parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles will all have a wonderful time together.  It will make your time together a little happier and a little brighter.  And that is what memories are all about.</p></body></html>

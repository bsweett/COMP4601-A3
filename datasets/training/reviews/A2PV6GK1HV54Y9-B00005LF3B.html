<meta name="summary" content="Good film but too long."></head><body><p>Cast Awat starring Tom Hanks is a good and sad film but it runs 45 minutes too long. The beginning and middle are the best and satisfying parts, the last hour is a bit of a letdown and the ending is left open so the viewer can ponder what road this man has decided to embark on. Hanks is the best thing in this film, his acting is remarkable, only he could pull off this quiet but intense performance. Helen Hunt is miscast and so is Chris Noth. Cast Away is worth a viewing, so check it sometime.</p></body></html>

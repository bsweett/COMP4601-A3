<meta name="summary" content="Underrated adaptation of the classic Vertigo character"></head><body><p>Based on the long running Hellblazer comic series from DC/Vertigo, Constantine is an underrated big budget smash.  Keanu Reeves, of all people, is cast as John Constantine: a man caught between Heaven and Hell.  Coming to the assistance of a detective (Rachel Weisz) whose twin sister committed suicide, Constantine faces off against half-breed demons and angels, embroiled in a plot to bring Hell to Earth.  Pseudo-catholic mythology aside, the film for the most part has an intriguing story, and the CGI effects are top notch.  Reeves is fine as an american accented John Constantine, while Weisz gives the best performance of the film.  Tilda Swinton is a nice touch as the asexual Gabriel, Bush singer Gavin Rossdale provides a few chuckles as a slimy demon, and Peter Stormare makes a great Lucifer.  As a whole, Constantine is a great mainstream thriller, even though it is a bit drawn out, and at times, a bit hokey.  With all the negative reviews that Constantine has garnered since it's initial release (from reviewers and comic fans alike), it's terribly underrated for what it really is.  Yes, John's not english or blonde (Sean Bean, who has been in everything from the first Lord of the Rings film to Troy, would have been an excellent choice had the film been more faithful to it's source material), but it's still better than many of the recent comic to film adaptations to be released as of late.  The 2-disc Deluxe Edition DVD features some nice extras, including a horde of deleted scenes, and featurettes on the origin of the character.</p></body></html>

How he landed on Earth, was raised by great parents, and became Earth's greatest hero.  In 1978, Warner Brothers wanted to bring this iconic hero to the big screen with "Superman: The Movie".  Well audiences of course were curious to see if the movie could pull of the seemingly impossible, and to their surprise Warner Brothers proved to audiences that a man can fly.<br /><br />"Superman: The Movie" is based, of course, on the DC Comic book character of the same name.  "Superman: The Movie" is basically an origin film for the hero, which does an excellent job of adapting the legends origins and presenting them on the big screen.  Included are everyone's favorite characters, Lois, Jimmy, Lex Luthor, and of course Clark Kent/Superman.  Once Clark (Christopher Reeve as Superman/Clark Kent) comes to Metropolis to begin his life as Superman he earns the city's admiration as he saves Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) from a helicopter crash.  At the same time, evil genius Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman), is plotting to, of course, take over the world and only Superman can stop him.<br /><br />With great performances from the cast, to great special effects (especially for the time it was made and suprisingly they hold up pretty well today), and brilliant directing by Richard Donner, "Superman: The Movie" proved you can make a comic book film seriously and it will do big money.  "Superman: The Movie" is one of the best comic book adaptations brought to the big screen, kick starting a huge franchise, and setting off a trend that continues to this day.<br /><br />"Superman: The Movie" is rated PG for violence.</p></body></html>

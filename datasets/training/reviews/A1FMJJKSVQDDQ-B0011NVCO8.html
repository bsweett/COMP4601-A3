This is not just a gangster flick, but, like The Godfather & Heat, is also a psychological drama. It tells the story of Frank Lucas, an African-American man who becomes a #1 drug importer in 60's Harlem. Richie Roberts is the cop who's willing to bring Lucas and his tainted business down. Seems like a simple story, but the film itself is far more complex. There is more story than action (not to say it is bad, but it really stands out with other awe-inspiring motion pictures). Ridley Scott simply knows how to make a great film, and this is one of his greatest. The performances here are also memorable. Washington, Crowe, Brolin, Gooding Jr., Nadal, Dee, Common, and T.I. give their roles their all, and they do it almost flawlessly. I'm surprised Washington wasn't even nominated for an Oscar. And the costumes and sets are just ravishing! It really feels like you're back in the late 60's, where you're anticipating the most intense boxing night in history.<br /><br />It's not as great as other gangster/cop flicks, but it's great on its own level. Grade: A</p></body></html>

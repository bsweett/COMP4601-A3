Let me just say, though, that in this case all those fawning critics were absolutely correct.<br /><br />Where do you start when recommending 'Hairspray'? The singing, to start with, is absolutely divine, and the lyrics of the songs are so fun and wild it's impossible not to laugh. The acting, too, is wonderful - Pffeifer is delightful in her role as the petty, aging prom queen; Latifa is spectacular, as always; Walken plays the same persona that he always plays so well; and while I was initially put off by Travolta's performance, he finally won me over and I had to admit that at the end of the movie, his character is probably one of my favorites - it's one thing to portray a character who is coming into her own as a young woman, but it's another thing entirely to pull off a character who is trying to recapture the spirit and joi de vivre of youth, and he does it well.<br /><br />I was surprised to see that so much of the plot of 'Hairspray' revolved not around accepting a young woman despite her heavy size (what I had assumed the movie would be about) and instead focusing on race relations and acceptance in society in general. Indeed, at the end of the movie, we have two of the most-rare-couples-in-movies: an interracial couple (where the girl is taller than the boy, no less!) and a heavy-girl/heartthrob-boy couple. This universal message prevents the movie from being just another teen movie about loving yourself and not listening to society's demands for perfection, and instead turns it into something timeless and classic. Even better, I was pleased to see that the main character never really judges her body image negatively - she is what she is, and it doesn't really bother her. That's incredibly unusual for a movie - the usual subtext underneath all the 'acceptance' platitudes is that, ideally, you would work to get that perfect body anyway, and just 'accept' yourself in the meantime. Tracy, however, doesn't 'accept' her flaws - she actively loves herself and acknowledges that she is lovely and talented.<br /><br />Although I'm sure that the musical from which this movie was adapted was probably even better (live performances very often are), I definitely recommend 'Hairspary' as one of the best movies I've seen. I went into it dreading a sludgy "love yourself" teen movie and instead found a movie that was incredibly funny, edgy, and unforgettable.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></body></html>

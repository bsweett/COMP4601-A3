<meta name="summary" content="This is a movie review, not a comparison to the book"></head><body><p>Whoa! Potter is a big teenager, and there are no childlike scenes here. I want to say I appreciate the one reviewer that reads the books but only pointed out things from the book that probably should have been included to clarify some things. They are very valid points. At least she did not give us a blow by blow why the movie wasn't the book. I will probably get some negative votes because I am fed up with some book reviewers reviewing movies as though they are the same medium. The movies can no more be the book than the book can be the movie. Once you understand that is not possible you will begin to appreciate the fact that a great deal of effort goes into bringing the ESSENCE of the book to the big screen. As well pointed out unfortunately sometimes the screenwriters, directors, etc. don't get it right and there is something missing that should have been included from the book. The movies are all great and this one certainly is almost as good as the others. Harry must once again prove himself to his friends and the school.<br /><br />This time in a Tri-Wizard contest which he didn't even volunteer to be in. How was he selected? But that is only the beginning of questionable things happening. There is a bit more friction between him and Ron this time. But then considering their ages and the competitive nature of school, is it any wonder? The characters are further developed and the storyline is incredible. The special effects in the magic scenes are excellent. By far the scariest, and not for small children as some scenes are very intense. He must battle not only formidible creatures but his own mortality as well and watch the death of a friend. It will keep you guessing who he can trust to the very end. What struck me most is how much the people playing the characters, and the characters too have aged and matured. As in the books this story is definitely darker than previous ones. I highly recommend it for the adults, but not children and I am sure Rowling would tell you her books were never meant for young children. A bug being tortured, child morphed and tormented, Harry almost drowning, scary mermen attacking, a girl dragged underground by plants, and a young man being killed is not for the faint of heart. A must if you have the other three, but not  as lighthearted as the first two and even darker than the third.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Constantine" Burns"></head><body><p>"God is a kid playing with an antfarm." - John Constantine tells Angela, God has a plan for us all, but, its not what everybody is thinking it is in "Constantine"<br /><br />O.K. adaption to the popular "Vertigo" comic book entitled "Hellblazer" (personally I've never read the comic), but, overall the film is no great shakes.<br /><br />John Constantine has a gift/curse. He has the ability to see real demons roaming the Earth & possessing the living. As the film unfolds the viewer finds out that Constantine rids the planet of these demons to buy his way into Heaven. It seems Constantine at an early age was able to see these demons that no one else can. His parents send him to the local nuthouse for a severe psych evaluation & testing (shock therapy). At the age of 15, Johnnie commits suicide & gets a glimpse of eternal damnantion in Hell. But,to his luck, John is saved & figures that if he bargains his way into Heaven, by ridding Earth of all of its demons, he may spend eternity in Heaven than in Hell (it doesn't work that way, John boy).<br /><br />Things change when a young woman, Angela, comes to Constantine asking for his help in the suicide/murder of her twin sister. John doesn't have much time either. Being diagnosed with severe lung cancer its time John Constantine pays the piper. Or is it?<br /><br />With Hell waiting for him, Heaven not wanting him, Earth needs John Constantine.<br /><br />The film is pretty formulaic, but decent. Keanu Reeves continues his suck-ass acting streak (I swear if he wins an Oscar, the Earth will literaly explode) as the title role coming across as a Neo/Dirty Harry smoking enough smokes to make him the new Marlboro Man. The film strives to rise above the norm but can't. Rent the DVD.</p></body></html>

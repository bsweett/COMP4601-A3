But I'm on a bit of a Hitchcock thing right now and want to see all of his films.  One of the beautiful things about the movie is its superb use of location. The whole movie, bar a couple of brief scenes, is set in the apartment.  The obvious twists Mr. Hitchcock could have delivered upon us are never used. Perhaps we would have found out that in fact the neighbor's wife was alive, but that the neighbor was in fact involved in a crime. What was buried in the garden? The stolen jewel perhaps? No, We never really find out, they just elude to the mysterious treasure and we are left to assume it is just another cut up bit of wife.  Over all the story wasn't all that bad, it does pull you along, and it keeps you watching. But, admittedly a large part of that is because the viewer is left expecting one of those supposedly famous "Hitchcock Twists", but with a rushed and unimaginative ending, the twist never comes.  What intrigued me is that we can witness Stewart's voyeurism, taking the journey with him from curiosity to suspicion to certainty to fear, finally subconsciously delighting in becoming voyeurs ourselves.  I actually caught myself sitting up on the edge of my couch near the end of this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A masterpiece to this day!"></head><body><p>Top-notch filmaker Stephen Spielberg spins a tale about a shark that is stalking the waters of Amity Island, a vaction spot for tourists. And this shark is HUNGRY!  It's up to a policeman and his friends to defeat this giant shark! Brilliant acting, lots of action, and a great musical score [ who could forget the "do-do-do-do" of the shark theme?] makes Jaws a pure classic. The bloopers are funny, too. [There's a blooper about a gun. The actor actually says the F-word!]<br /><br /> After you watch this film, you may never go into the water again, not even to take a bath! :)<br /><br />PS: For a funny Jaws parody, check this out: http://www.angryalien.com/0804/jawsbunnies.asp</p></body></html>

So why the 5-star rating? I was so totally compelled and profoundly disturbed by the film that it falls into the category of "Brilliant Films I'll Never See Again" (Another recent example of that is MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE). Guy Pearce is the kind of actor who never seems to get the acclaim he so richly deserves, and he's astonishing as Leonard. Joey Pants (Pantoliano) is chewing up a good deal of scenery in this film and certainly appears to steal some scenes, but Pearce's self-effacing charm and quiet intensity make you unable to take your eyes off him. Carrie-Anne Moss doesn't amount to as much as I would have preferred, although that may be more to do with her rather uninteresting performance.<br /><br />When you get right down to it, the film ultimately belongs to Nolan. By using the reverse-order single-scene narrative, he makes a film that is very uncomfortable to watch since the film essentially is taking place inside Leonard's fractured mind. Being inside of a mind like that is such a disturbing place to be, and I think that's what keeps me from watching the film again, but I can still say without a doubt, I still realize what a powerful, suspenseful and great film MEMENTO is, and I am doubly glad that Chris Nolan continues to make films that not only defy Hollywood convention, but they also push you and challenge your ideas. In another life, Nolan designed great mazes and created great riddles. In this life, you get to see them unfold on-screen, even if you don't get the answer or find the exit.<br /><br />With the exception of INSOMNIA, which is a film I respect but don't like, Nolan has made some of the very best films of the last decade. From THE PRESTIGE to BATMAN BEGINS to THE DARK KNIGHT to INCEPTION and MEMENTO, Nolan is now a name on par with the very best cinema has to offer.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's a Wonderful Life"></head><body><p>This is one of the most beloved movies in film history.  It is very uplifting, and while can be viewed at anytime for a boost, it always has been part of my family's Christmas Eve tradition.  While the colorized version is okay, I prefer the original black and white.  The quality appears to be much better, and maybe that has something to do with traditional expectations also.  I always wonder when they make a movie like this, if they realize it is something special, and how important it will be.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Strange Movie With a Strange Format"></head><body><p>Guy Pearce and Joe Pantoliano star in this strange and  difficult movie to follow about a man who is hunting for his wife's killer.  Leonard Shelby (Pearce) is obsessed with finding the man who murdered his wife.  However, due to the trauma he suffered during the struggle to save his wife, he now suffers from short term memory loss.  Due to this condition, he's only able to remember names, events, and places for a very short time before he completely forgets them.  He has resorted to taking polaroids, writing notes, and even tattooing messages on his body.<br /><br />Joe Pantoliano stars as Teddy, a person who befriends Leonard and tries to help him find the killer.  But is Teddy all that he seems to be?<br /><br />I found this movie to be very hard to understand.  In reality, it was made backwards; with the ending shown first, and the film then works backwards to the start. It was hard to keep track of the plot, and I really had to "work" to watch the movie and keep track of the events.  Some parts of the movie were good, but when the conclusion came, I was left with just as many questions as I was at the beginning (or should I say end?). Thus, I only recommend this movie to people who have a sharp sense of detail, and who can follow events very closely.</p></body></html>

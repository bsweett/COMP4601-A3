It's been a long time since we've seen a disutopian novel put on the screen.  'Children of Men' takes place in 2026, not too far in the future.  The planet has become infertile, and baby Diego, the youngest member of the planet has been killed in a terrorist attack in London.  Theo Farran (Clive Owen) is caught between the polarities of that world:  There's the military arm of the government, keeping immigrants in the equivalent of concentration camps.  Then, there's the underground resistance.  Theo's a pedestrian.  He cares about keeping as much stability in the chaos and out of as much trouble as possible.  His love interest is for Jillian who's a part of that underground, and his friend, Jasper (Michael Caine), is an elderly hippie who lives out in the country and maintains a mild mannered, but mature dissenter.  As an insider, Theo has what the resistance needs, a program to support their cause.  They give him an offer he can't refuse.  More interesting is someone under their wings, a Fuji woman who is pregnant and in hiding.  Theo has mission impossible, he must, significantly enough, evade both the police state and the rebel radicals while bringing the woman and her baby to safety.<br /><br />Messages galore come out from the movie.  The infertility part is certainly extrapolation, but little else is.  (Merely blowing up tendencies of today is an essential ingredient of science fiction, however.)  The mounting of counter-terrorism in a war at civilization's footstep doesn't try to bring the future too many leaps forward.  The composite picture is an ominous urban nightmare with dilapidated buildings, broken glass, and villains with submachine guns everywhere.  While I think 'Children of Men' is a good diversion from the usual movie fare, I sometimes thought as skillfully as the battle scenes are delivered, and the speeches are being made, that maybe the dialogue and a greater variety of developments would have made it a better picture.  Still, I must concede the movie still haunted me long after I left the theatre.</p></body></html>

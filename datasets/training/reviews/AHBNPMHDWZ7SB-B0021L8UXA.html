<meta name="summary" content="One of the Better Romero Remakes"></head><body><p>The Crazies was a pleasant surprise. After how good Dawn of the Dead was, I was looking forward to another remake of a George Romero zombie, or zombie-esque film. It did not disappoint, but it kind of aggrivates me to say that I do not see a movie of this nature ever being more than what we have seen already in this one, Dawn of the Dead, I Am Legend, or 28 Days Later. I would love to watch a zombie movie that elevates the genre, but it seems to be stuck in a stagnant cycle. But getting past that, I can see the production value in this one. The colors are vivid and help set the shifting tones perfectly. Throughout the course of the film we witnessed a few great scenes in the night time (which most zombie movies tend to fixate on), but also just as many duriing the day. And none were more exciting than the last. I actually bought the explanation of the virus, and began to genuinely hate the government for what it did. That rarely happens to me when I watch these kinds of movies. The actors were great too. All were believable, and I fealt sorry for them. I even fealt sorry for the townsfolk that had been infected.<br /><br />Timothy Olyphant was a great choice to lead the cast as the town sheriff, David. Radha Mitchell played his wife Judy, and she was just as great. I enjoyed seeing the depth in their relationship, and how much they went through for each other. My favorite performance was Joe Anderson as the deputy, Russell. He provided, not only comic relief at times, but also a depth equal to the main characters, and a final resolution that is quite commendable and may bring a tear to someone's eye depending on how invested in this story they are. The transfer is superb, and the extras are surprisingly thorough. So overall, I would recommend The Crazies to everyone who enjoys these kinds of films. It's not too gorey like most movies in its subgenre, there isn't an abundance of profanity, and there's no sexual content at all. So in my opinion, it's pretty family friendly for what it is (to an extent of course).</p></body></html>

The name is practically synonomous with something that will entertain you.<br /><br />And second, who would find fault with a genuine attempt at a good movie??<br /><br />Okay, there are a few problems, but nothing that would prevent me from thoroughly enjoying this movie. It was awesome.<br /><br />For factual people out there, there are some very legitimate "problems" with our whole history of evolution. What has been taught and thought for the last 100 years has been a questionable enterprise. There are historical sites around the world that call into question some very basic ideas that most of us hold as TRUE. Current underwater archeology has shown cities that are not where they should be. That the 11 or 13,000 years of human activity may actually be a LOT longer. I know, it infuriates some people to think that some of the human history we accept, may be a little off. Or totally wrong, different, longer. Using Procession of the Earth, some very respected scientists are dating the Great Pyramid to an age of 13,000 years (this would be to accurately point the 'holes' directly at those stars, and there's no way to carbon date the Pyramid, so who's to say?).<br /><br />The point is, that our history IS ACTUALLY a mystery, the greatest mystery. And for someone to offer up a fictional story, exploring an idea is wonderful. No, I don't think that Prometheus accurately tells our historical beginnings, but why not think outside of the BOX? It's the only way we will ever get closer to the truth. The TRUTH, IS INDEED STRANGER THAN FICTION. If anything, I believe that. So go on Ridley, you keep at it, I AM ENTERTAINED. That's the whole point of a good story, NO??</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Escape into the Labrinth...."></head><body><p>A friend of mine recommended this film to me and I'm so glad he did.  What an amazing film!<br /><br />The director Quillermo del Toro deserves all the acolades he is receiving for this beautiful piece of work.  Set in the early fourties during the facists and bloody Franco regime, the story follows a young girl named Ofelia, who along with her pregnant mother, arrives to live with her cold and sadistic step father, an army captain.  As an escape from the harsh surroundings and her mother's ill health, Ofelia begins to slip into her imagination (or is it?) to visit the labrinth of a Satyr who promises to return a kingdom in which she is a princess.  Once she has completed three tasks assigned by the satyr (and with the aid of his pets--faeries) she is told she will be returned to her royal family.<br /><br />Along side the story of Ofelia, we see the rebels fighting the facists and the troubles they face against a heartless and violent government. Though it is considered a fairy tale (for adults) this is not a Disney produced "happily-ever-after".  Then again, life is very rarely happily-ever-after.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed, with great effects and solid acting, "Pan's Labrinth" is a gem in a year that was pretty lack luster in the good film department.  I recommend this film and look forward to its release on dvd.</p></body></html>

Charlize Theron did an excellent job of playing the lead role of Aeon Flux as I wouldn't have thought she'd be good at this particular role!! This role had seemed more suited for Angelina Jolie!<br /><br />Loved the settings and costumes for this movie. Aeon Flux is set 400 years in the future and most futuristic movies made over the years have been very dark, drab, & dreary..... Aeon Flux's settings are light and bright and are very nature inspired... a more feminine feel. The costumes are great.... a sexy few to them.<br /><br />Thought the writers of the script did an excellent job of translating the original animation series to a non-animated movies with real characters and settings.</p></body></html>

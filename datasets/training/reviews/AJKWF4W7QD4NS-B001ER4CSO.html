Like the first film before it, Hellboy II: The Golden Army finds the visionary director of Pan's Labyrinth and Blade II bringing Hellboy and his cohorts to vivid life, and doing a spectacular job of it.  The film picks up with Hellboy (Ron Perlman), his pyrotechnic girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair), and fellow B.P.R.D. agent Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) running afoul of a vengeful elf (Luke Goss) who seeks to restore his kingdom's power by awakening a legendary indestructible army to go to war with mankind.  To complicate matters Hellboy gets a new, by-the-book boss in the form of Johan Krauss (who has been brilliantly realized on film, and is wonderfully voiced by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane), and has some looming problems with his relationship with Liz to boot.  Hellboy II manages to successfully top the first film in nearly every way, featuring some brilliant set-pieces and art design, and some even more spectacular makeup and creature effects.  The world that Del Toro oversees here really is a world of wonder that should not be missed out at all in the least bit, especially if you are a fan of Hellboy.  All in all, Hellboy II: The Golden Army is a wonderful comic book adaptation from a visionary director, and here's hoping that there will be more to come from Del Toro and Hellboy alike.</p></body></html>

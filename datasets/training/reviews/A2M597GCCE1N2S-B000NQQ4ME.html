Mel Gibson directs this powerful film that made many critics claim that it was "the best movie of the year" as well as "brutally violent" and "shockingly disturbing." Watching this film I have to say that it is more about the story of one man struggling to overcome the odds to get back to the ones he loves and even though there is violence its a small part compared to the larger picture.<br /><br />Rudy Youngblood plays a man named Jaguar Paw in Mayan times. He and his tribe are very comfortable, living in their part of their forest. However just one day after meeting another tribe that was passing through their lands because they were attacked by something, Jaguar Paw and his tribe are attacked and taken prisoner by a third tribe. Many of Jaguar Paw's fellow villagers are killed, most are taken prisoner, but Jaguar Paw's wife and kid are trapped in an underground well after trying to escape.<br /><br />After being bound together, Jaguar Paw and a few of his tribesmen are led on a long journey to a huge temple kingdom somewhere far away. It is there that Jaguar Paw realizes that they are meant to be sacrifices to a god that thier captors worship. After what seems to be a miracle saves Jaguar Paw's life, Jaguar Paw has to escape and get back to his wife and child before it is too late.<br /><br />Apocalypto definately is not for those who cant stand the sight of blood, and the sacrifice scenes are indeed hard to watch for their brutally realistic reenactments. However the story of Jaguar Paw stuggling to stay alive to be with his family, especially his wife who is expecting another child, is something to be seen for the powerful performances that are shown in this film.<br /><br />What also is a good original idea for the film is showing the entire film in English subtitles but also with the actually Mayan subtitles being shown as well. I found it really interesting listening to the way the villagers interacted with each other and seeing how different and slightly similar the different tribes were when compared together. Even Jaguar Paw's captors and himself share some common traits. Another thing I liked about this movie is the beautiful scenery. Giant waterfalls, dense jungles, huge fields, and beautiful ancient cities make this movie something that definately needs to be seen to get lost in. This is one movie you should see if you want to see a great film about love, passion, and survival.<br /><br />Extas include:<br /><br />Commentary by Director Mel Gibson and co-writer Farhad Safinia<br /><br />Becoming Mayan: The Making of Apocalypto<br /><br />Deleted Scens with commentary by Mel Gibson<br /><br />I walked into the theater not knowing what to expect. Since it was a Mel Gibson film I assumed it was going to be nothing but violence. However I was surprised by how intriguing this film became. This movie is definatley recommended. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

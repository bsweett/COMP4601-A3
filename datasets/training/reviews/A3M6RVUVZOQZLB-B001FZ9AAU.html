<meta name="summary" content="Suit up, Ironman, time to soar...!"></head><body><p>Review Number 447.<br /><br />What has red plates, an arc converter, firepower, the ability to fly, and Robert Downey, Jr inside? Yes, I know you know--Iron Man! What with the magic of movie making tricks, a great cast, a creative director, and the edgy, cagey star power of Downey, why wouldn't this movie be a hit? A BIG HIT!<br /><br />The really wild aspect of this movie is that it does not have the feel or look of a comic book. It's more akin to true sci-fi--take a man who has barbs of a modern bomb in his chest, barbs that will migrate to his heart without a battery attached to keep them stationary. Then take this same man who is a munitions genius holed up in a cave with crazed, power hungry Middle Easterners as his captors, demanding the Jericho bomb for their very own. They have many of his weapon types with the puzzling question--how did these weapons end up in their possession?<br /><br />Tony Stark, son of a powerful, very wealthy weapons designer and maker, and godson of Jeff Bridges' character who assumed the mantle of the company at the founder's death, finally has an awakening to the true meaning of destruction while a captive. He must escape with the mysterious, multi-lingual man who assists him in the creation of an escape device--an iron suit, indestructible (for a short while).<br /><br />I've given a background for Iron Man--how he came to be, his inner turmoil leading to a change in professional and personal direction. Robert Downey Jr. makes this all work with his slim, but not powerful physique. He's just Joe Average physically--well, better than that because he has no fat, but he is not bulked up. It is his face, those eyes that make his every close-up so conducive to the building of the story. In his early middle age, Downey has IT and makes IT work in his character and role.<br /><br />Other actors contribute as much: Jeff Bridges (always a favorite actor) becomes an excellent villain. My gosh, in his first scene the viewer knows  he will be a villain. He looks the part! Terrence Howard continues to build his impressive resume here, although he doesn't have as much to do, but his last line sets his role in a sequel.<br /><br />Although Gwenth Paltrow plays the handy girl assistant-- again, the viewer knows that her role will also expand in the future.  As for the S.H.E.I.L.D. agent, I expected him to say "the Other Christine" at any moment.<br /><br />"Iron Man" is an exciting movie. I expect to see it again! What's the record for reviews of a movie on Amazon? I expect this one will break that record! Once a person views this film she just has to praise it--it's that good (if you like violence and excitement and creative genius and heroes and desire to do the right thing and....see what I mean?)</p></body></html>

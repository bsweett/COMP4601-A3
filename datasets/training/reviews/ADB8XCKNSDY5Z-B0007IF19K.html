<meta name="summary" content="Scandal Is Nothing New"></head><body><p>I was born in 1981, so I missed every event featured in this movie.  Ray was always that smiling, blind piano guy to me.  I had no idea he was involved in such shameful scandal.  But what's even more interesting is that at least one of his scandals was based on a noble cause instead of a shameful one.<br /><br />Ray is a perfect picture of humanity.  Struggling through through neverending internal and external obstacles, and always on the verge of total collapse no matter how high his talent and hard work had taken him.  In fact, the higher he went, the closer to collapse he seemed to get.  Why is it that so often no blessing or curse deters us from loving the very things that kill us?<br /><br />I'll never look at Ray's music the same way again.  This was a wonderful film.</p></body></html>

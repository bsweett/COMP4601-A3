<meta name="summary" content="Horror/Thriller keeps the blood pumping"></head><body><p>The movie begins with a subplot of a killer's interview.  Next, on a dark and stormy night, many lives will come together.  George York (John C. McGinley - Dr. Cox from Scrubs) along with his wife Alice and stepson Timothy have a blowout.  Alice is hit by limo driver Ed (John Cusack) driving movie star Caroline (Rebecca De Mornay).  They rush to the closest phone, which is at an out-of-the-way hotel.  Joining them for the evening, also trapped by the storm and flooding, is hooker Paris (how appropriate) played by Amanda Peet, and Officer Rhodes (Ray Liotta) transporting a prisoner (Jake Busey - don't Busey's make the best bad guys?), and a young couple whose passtime is arguing.<br /><br />Rhodes' prisoner escapes, and then people begin to turn up dead.  Secrets are revealed, there are arguments, a lot of creeping around in the rain, and nail-biting suspense.  But there's more to this movie than just the typical whodunit.  Where is the connection between these people?  The key to the puzzle is much more complex than you think.  The plot twists and twists again in a most satisfying manner.  I can't say any more without revealing spoilers.<br /><br />John Cusack and Ray Liotta give stellar performances, and John C. McGinley is good in everything he does.  The film is well photographed and the atmosphere is sufficiently dreary to create the required mood.  This is a great movie for a group of friends and a large bowl of buttered popcorn.  Keep the lights on.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

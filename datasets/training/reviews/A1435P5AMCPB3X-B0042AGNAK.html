<meta name="summary" content="Decent film, good action"></head><body><p>This film is not nearly as dark or as good as it could have been, but Nicholas Cage (older Johnny Blaze)and Sam Elliot do a fiar job, along with Peter Fonda as Mestopheles.  This is a builder movie for sequals, and sets up the storyline of Ghost Rider Well.  There are parts that the movie feels a bit choppy and disjointed, but overall, I found this decent to watch, but could have been more.  Worth a matinae ticket, or a rental in the future.</p></body></html>

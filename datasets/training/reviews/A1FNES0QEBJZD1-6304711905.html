<meta name="summary" content="Tombstone on Blu Ray"></head><body><p>I have long felt that this was one of the greatest westerns ever made, an incredibly delivered story with amazing acting by all involved.  Yes, Kilmer's Doc Holiday almost steals the movie but, never the less, a wonderful film.  However, I wound up returning the Blu Ray disc simply because I wanted the whole film, not a cut version of it.  The Standard Definition film with the full 135 minutes still retains excellent video and audio quality and I would rather have the entire version than a Reader's Digest Condensed version.  Should they come out with the Directors cut on Blu Ray with the movie intact, then that is the one I will buy.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of help and, if so, please check the 'Helpful' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you.

Charlize Theron has won the trophy hands-down with her portrayal of Florida's iron lady, serial killer Aileen Wuornos, in Patty Jenkins' amazing debut film Monster.<p>Monster is a biopic about the last months of Wuornos' freedom, from the time of her meeting with "Selby Wall" (Christina Ricci; her real-life counterpart had a different name) until the time of her arrest and trial, during which Wuornos, a highway prostitute, killed seven johns. And that, in a nutshell, is the plot. As far as biopics go, really, there's not much here you haven't seen before plotwise.<p>But the reason to see it, and I tell you you must see it now, is the ugly, painful depths of emotion to be found throughout the film. Theron's performance has already received lavish praise, all of it deserved. Less noted, but perhaps even finer, is the performance of Christina Ricci, whose character transforms from straight-up God-fearing closeted lesbian into a sneering carbon copy of Wuornos in subtle ways throughout the film, making the irony of the film's ending twist just a little further into the gut. Great supporting roles are also turned in by Bruce Dern and a number of cameos.<p>Despite the questions raised by the film, another thing that makes it brilliant is its refusal to pander to any particular group, something which it could very easily have done on many levels. There's no gay-acceptance subtext. There's no anti-death-penalty subtext. There's the allegation, which I have never seen before in any media treatment of Wuornos, that the seven murders were not all in self defense. (About time, too.) There's brilliant and beautiful irony laced throughout the film, and all of it played perfectly. The film walks on the edges of a whole lot of knives, and the balancing act it performs is masterful.<p>Roger Ebert called Monster the best film of 2003. I haven't seen quite as many movies as he has (oh, to have such a job), but of the lot that I've come across, I am more than happy to agree. Monster is a brilliant film, it is an important film, and it is a film you cannot see fast enough. Turn off the computer, get in your car, and go to the theater. Now. **** ?</p></body></html>

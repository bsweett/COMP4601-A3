Nick Chinlund (Con Air, Tears of the Sun) plays Daxus, a human with ridiculous noseplugs who wants to destory the race that Jovovich belongs to. Jovovich then helps out a little boy clonse of Daxus named Six played by Cameron Bright (Running Scared, Godsend) who may be a cure to cure Jovovich's fang problem. William Fichtner (Tv's Invasion, Armageddon) also stars as Garth, a friend of Violet's. Kurt Wimmer who directed the much better Equilibrium fails in Ultraviolet resulting in a BOMB and beyond. Jovovich plays the same performance here that she does in the Resident Evil movies which is really annoying. It's too bad you're doing this spit Jovovich...too bad. Fichtner and Chinlund are wasted and Bright plays the same performance like so many of his other films. That kid needs a break. All the acting with the dialouge is dense and the action scenes are pretty weak. Also starring a seriously horrible Sebastien Andrieu (Look at Me).</p></body></html>

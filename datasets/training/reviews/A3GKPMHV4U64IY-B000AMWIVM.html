<meta name="summary" content="Let's Play a Game"></head><body><p>Jigsaw is a diabolical and ingenious menace.  He is not a serial killer per se, but someone who puts people in situations where they kill themselves and others.  Each victim finds themselves in tense situation where they have to make hard decisions regarding what they will do to go on living.  The main story concerns two individuals who awaken in an abandoned bathroom chained and confused.  In the middle of the room is a dead body in a spreading pool of blood.  There is a gun and a tape player, both out of reach.  But each of the two men have found a cassette with the words Play Me on them.<br /><br />The to men discover the game they are part of.  If successful, one of them will be dead.  If not, certain loved ones will die instead.  There are rules to be followed.  As the two become more and more desperate, we learn more about them and the evil mind that has put them in this situation.  Although the two are the center of the story, we also get tied up with several other victims and the police investigation.  The action get more and more tense as the time limit is almost reached.  In the end the story delivers with a series of twists at the end that just leave you stunned.  A very good film.<br /><br />This two-disk edition has some interesting features including the original short film that was expanded into the current film.  I have to say that it was a pleasure to see an intelligent horror film again (they are so rare).  I hope the sequel is just as intelligent.  The acting, action, and settings were top notch.  Several moments made me jump (also a rare thing).  As the credits began to roll and all of the twists sank in fully, all I could think was, "Neat!"  If you like your horror raw and intelligent then this is one for you.  If you just want a mindless killer like Jason, then this will not fit the bill.  Check it out.</p></body></html>

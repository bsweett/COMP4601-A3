<meta name="summary" content="Controversial yes, but nevertheless very powerful..."></head><body><p>The fact that Charlize Theron gives an unforgettable performance plus that "Monster" is very intimidating has been told in detail by most reviewers here, so instead, i'll take on the objections voiced by those who feel that this film is portraying a serial murderer in a way so she comes across as "more human".<p>  First off, some people claimed that the film is not accurate and that Aileen Wuornos (the real life killer) was nothing more than a cold blooded murderer. Aside from the first murder, which even in the evidence presented in court, was shown to have been committed in self defense after a savage rape, the film does show that eventually Wuornos killed for the money. Or did she?<p>  The reason i feel that this film does a good (but not quite great) job of going below the surface is because it shows us this woman's life without resorting to cheap sensationalism and without overstating or understating anything. This woman, like many 1000s, or even millions of people, basically live in that fringe of our society that resembles hell. She acquired street wits in the process but she also acquired brutal hopelessness, terminal despair, and ultimately distrust for anyone around her.<p>  When she gets in an affair with Selby, this relationship becomes to her the only way to exit the giant toilet bowl she virtually lives in. Problem was, like with many other things in life, she had no clue how. In her particular case, the fact that she wound up killing for a mere $200 shows what type of despair we're talking about. It's an old argument really, but one that wont go away no matter how hypocritically some of us choose to look at things, that is: anybody in our societies, "good" or "bad" is a direct product of that society. And that's undeniable, noone drops suddenly from the sky and lives amongst us.<br />  The character in "Monster" eventually comes to the point to treat people as she was treated. Yes, noone killed her physically (except the state in the end) but she had been morally and mentally "murdered" countless times before she turned into a murderer herself. <p>  Charlize Theron is incredible not because she took on 40 pounds and was made ugly to play this film, but because she stunningly managed to portray the mess in this woman's soul. That's the part of her acting that gave her the Oscar, which by the way - I felt- was one Oscar well deserved after a long, long time.<br />  But the same counts for the director of the film who manages to capture a life between rainy highways and back seats of cars, filthy apartments, sleazy bars with other hopeless characters, and ultimately a vast scape of nothingness. That's where the "Monster" was bred in and lived in.<p>  As for those who might've been offended with the film's language or the themes presented in it, well that's a true paradox, because that's like admitting that reality offends them. Sure, one can choose to avoid reality, but that never really works in the long run as "what's there" eventually -and always- catches up with us no matter what medium we use to avoid it.<p>  "Monster" is a truly good film, and in my opinion, whatever objections can be raised are either trivial or hypocritical.<br />  C.Theron is not the only one giving a great performance by the way. Christina Ricci is up to par with her even if this goes "unnoticed" as Theron's role is inevitably overshadowing.<br />  A film that intimidates with its rawness and its ultra-realism, "Monster" is one that wont let you easily forget it. Nor should you, if you ask me...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="If you are a Don Cheadle fan, go ahead and see it.  Otherwise..."></head><body><p>Don Cheadle is Samir Horn, a man who makes unlikely friends with a Middle-Eastern terrorist group.  Does he support their holy mission, in furtherance of the God he shares with them?  Or may he be the catalyst to bring this group down...from the inside?<br /><br />You can no longer count the number of movies about the global threat of Middle Eastern terrorism on one hand.  It is a topic that gets headlines around the world, and movie makers must salivate over the screenplays.  I have admitted my bias, and maybe that is what made this movie mediocre for me.  I thought the Americans were portrayed as ruthless, witless cowboys.  I'm not saying I agree or disagree with that viewpoint, but only that I grow tired of it.<br /><br />Don Cheadle is my saving grace.  He is one of the finest actors of this time.  He has a seriousness about him that makes everything he says worth hearing.  This movie followed him through some very difficult decisions and you feel torn in two directions almost more than he is.  He is a talent worth keeping an eye on.  He is also the only real highlight in this movie for me.  The rest of the movie was just another take on these now-popular, religious Crusades.</p></body></html>

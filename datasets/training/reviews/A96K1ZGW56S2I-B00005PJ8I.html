<meta name="summary" content="A Different Kind of Movie."></head><body><p>While watching CAST AWAY, a quote from another movie, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, kept coming to mind; "I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living or get busy dying." That quote sums up CAST AWAY. It is a movie about surviving and making choices.<p>Tom Hanks plays Chuck, a Fed-Ex trouble-shooter who is so constrained by time that he plans dates with his girlfriend months in advance. Chuck get called on an emergency assignment and his plane ends up crashing into the ocean. Chuck is the only survivor, but is abandoned on a deserted island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. The rest of the film revolves around Chuck's quest for survival and his re-education in living.<p>This is a Tom Hanks movie, make no doubt about it. He helped write it, produce it, and stars in it. However, if CAST AWAY was simply a Tom Hanks film and nothing more, it would have sunk faster than the drowning plane in the movie.<p>CAST AWAY is unlike any other film I have ever seen. Most people are sick of their existance in life and go to movies to be entertained. This movie is entertaining, but it's not just an entertainment film. This is a film that was made to make people think. The movie explores man's existance and forces one to ponder the important and not so important things of life: what truly is important in life? What do you most revere? What makes a friend? How strong is love? These are all questions that CAST AWAY forces one to examine. But the most important question of all is whether to get busy living or get busy dying.</p></body></html>

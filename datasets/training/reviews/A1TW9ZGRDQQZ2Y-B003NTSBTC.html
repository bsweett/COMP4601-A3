<meta name="summary" content="And I thought the island on LOST screwed with your head"></head><body><p>Shutter Island seems to be getting a lot of love or hate from the critics, but I happen to fall into the love circle of opinion, with maybe just a foot sticking out. The story really drew me in and even though I figured out the final twist early on (it's somewhat obvious and it's a BIG one), I didn't know how it would get to that point and why.<br /><br />The acting is terrific by everyone. Leonardo DiCaprio gets better and better with each passing film. Just look how far he has progressed since his weak turn in Gangs of New York (or maybe it was just Daniel Day-Lewis stealing his thunder). Ben Kingsley is always fascinating to watch and all the other big names in roles large and small put forth very good efforts, from Mark Ruffalo, Max von Sydow, Patricia Clarkson, Ted Levine, Emily Mortimer, Michelle Williams, all the way to Jackie Earle Haley.<br /><br />Martin Scorsese is considered by most to be one of the finest directors to ever live, and while Shutter Island is better than his average works like Cape Fear or Bringing Out the Dead, it's not one of his best. Still, you can't deny his visual style, the atmosphere he can create, or the way he can capture the inner torment of one's soul (by using some really freaky dream sequences in this case).<br /><br />Now, on the slightly negative side. I think I would have liked it even more had it not reminded so much of David Fincher's film, The Game. If you haven't seen that movie, you will probably have your mind blown with this one.<br /><br />Shutter Island is not flawless in any sense, but it's a well crafted mystery with plenty of chills. Now, what idiot moved this film's release date from the month of Halloween to February? I guess SAW VI had them running for cover. What a sad statement that is.</p></body></html>

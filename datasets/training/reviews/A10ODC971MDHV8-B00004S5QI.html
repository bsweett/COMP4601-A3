<meta name="summary" content="Amedeus"></head><body><p>A marvelously acted, flawlessly directed story about jealousy, obsession, and perfectionism, Forman's stunning "Amadeus" mixes suspenseful drama with historical fact to create a winning fictional biography. The lead actors inhabit their roles with gusto, with Hulce's crass talent playing off Abraham's guileful Salieri with great results. Neville Marriner brings Mozart's music to vigorous life. Winning Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor (Abraham), "Amadeus" is a triumph that will delight anyone with a soft spot for cracked genius.</p></body></html>

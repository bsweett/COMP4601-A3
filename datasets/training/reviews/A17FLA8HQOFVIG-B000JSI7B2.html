<meta name="summary" content="Mostly, it made me shudder with disgust."></head><body><p>This 2001 film was produced and directed by the Hughes Brothers and based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell.  As you know, graphic novels are actually comic strips and, even though there is no animation in the film, &quot;From Hell&quot; has the look and feel of that kind of exaggeration throughout.  <p>In 1888, there were some real and unsolved murders of prostitutes in London by someone nicknamed Jack the Ripper.  That's what this story is based on.  It stars Johnny Depp as the inspector who must solve the case.  He loves to do drugs and in several scenes he's either smoking a pipe in an opium den or cooking up some laudanum at home.  His visions become clues to solving crimes and he's good at his job.  <p>The murdered women are always surgically violated and this leads the good inspector to suspect that the murderer knows a lot about human anatomy.  And so he seeks out the medical establishment to help him and we all see more than we ever wanted to know about lobotomies.  The camera doesn't actually focus on details of the murders themselves, but there is so much talk about them and they are described so graphically, that it made me shudder with disgust.<p>There's the search for the killer of course, and there's also a romance between the inspector and a pretty young woman played by Heather Graham who sure could use a few lessons in acting.  Ian Holm is cast as the royal surgeon and, as the plot thickens, one of the suspects is even a member of the royal family.  I found it all quite silly as well as disgusting although I think it captured the spirit of the myth of Victorian England as a harborer of dirty streets and dirty secrets.<p>The film is intoxicating in a way, moved fast, and set up a mystery that was intriguing.  But there were so many absolutely sickening scenes that I soon grew to hate it.</p></body></html>

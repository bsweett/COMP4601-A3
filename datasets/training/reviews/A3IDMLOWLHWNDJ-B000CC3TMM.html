<meta name="summary" content=""Transporter" Part Deux"></head><body><p>"I'm in need of a Transporter."<br /><br />"I'm listening." - Master Transporter, Frank Martin can hear his next customer now in "Transporter 2"<br /><br />Decent sequel to the "Transporter" has Frank Martin doing a favor for a friend by watching over a Senator's young son. But, when the boy is kidnapped by terrorists The Transporter puts it into overdrive to retrieve the boy & take out the terrorists. Things get worse when Frank finds out that the boy has been injected with a deadly virus that kills everyone that comes in contact with him. Frank has less than 4 hours to retrieve the antidote & stop the spread of the disease. Good luck.<br /><br />The film is just about non-stop action with the usual intercuts of the family going through the worried argueing phase, while the cops try to formulate a plan.<br /><br />The film has a few flaws. The CGI action is terrible. Leading to a lot of "Yeah, right!" sequences that almost sink the film entirely. Jason Statham is great as the transporter & holds the film together.</p></body></html>

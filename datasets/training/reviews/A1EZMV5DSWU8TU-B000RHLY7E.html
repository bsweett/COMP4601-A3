<meta name="summary" content="Dirty, dusty, bloody, ugly, brutal, vulgar..."></head><body><p>Essentially, Rob Zombie brings back the B-movie tradition of the 70's/80's-style slasher-flick, utilizing aesthetics with a combination of influences from 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'Friday the 13th', even 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' {particularly in the resemblence of 'Tiny's mangled face to Freddy Krueger}. These personages are based on Marx Brothers characters in name only - these are entirely "hellbilly" in countenance, consisting primarily of Captain Spaulding, Otis, and Baby Firefly, with a couple of side characters, who are veritably 'awakened' from their slumber by vengeful Police from the massacres in the previous film House of 1,000 Corpses". Mama Firefly is taken into custody, and Tiny is nowhere to be found...<br /><br />Set in the Texas desert, this white-trash family, each with their own neurosis, bounce their particular insanities upon eachother, experiencing the joys and dangers of life on a caveman level of existance. After all, a family of wolves can at one moment enjoy a freshly slaughtered rabbit or deer together, happily tearing limb from limb, then go off to later play together.<br /><br />After another shootout, the pursuit begins again and they are on the run, pulling all their resources together at the expense of others, calling upon the evil clown to accompany Otis and Baby in this latest predicament. So after Spaulding accesses a car in the name of "important clown business", the three are reunited, spreading terror upon all those they encounter, usually ridiculing, humiliating, mutilating, and otherwise raping their victims before finally killing them.<br /><br />Along the way they meet up with pimp 'Charlie Altamont' {Ken Foree, whom you may recognize from 'From Beyond'} and have one hell of a time in wordly pleasures, until he pulls a veritable "Lando Calrisian"*, betraying the group to the crusading Sheriff. Charlie has more of a moron than an imbecile in a henchman named 'Clevon' {played by Michael Berryman: 'The Hills Have Eyes'}, engage in a particularly amusing scene while purchasing chickens from an inbred cletus.<br /><br />Sheriff Wydell, who fancies himself a "devil slayer", readies himself for a 'final confrontation' - a veritable "apocalypse" in his mind, employing the aid of a couple of nefarious bounty hunters called "The Unholy Two", comprised of imposing bikers 'Rondo' and 'Billy Ray Snapper', who interrupt the festivities and construct arrangements to Wydell's specifications. Continuing with his revenge-fueled righteous christinsanity, besides photos of victims being stapled to their chests, Otis is actually nailed into his chair a-la the nazarene {the fact that he has long hair and a beard added to the effect greatly}, and are set to burn alive in a literal "Hell". Now the punctilious "hunter becomes the hunted" scenario transgresses. "The Angel" is let loose to be pursued by the wolf on her heels receiving a taste of her own medicine, but in one of those unexpected 'twists', just when all seems finished, a mysterious ally appears...<br /><br />With the odds stacked against them, the movie ends in a hail of bullets to a final end...?<br /><br />With a relatively all-star cast, there will be some recognizable familiarities from time to time. Herein is one Priscilla Barnes {'Terri Alden' from 'Three's Company'}, being slapped around, fondled, deceived, and stabbed. Geoffrey Lewis, who has one of those faces materializing from many formative evocations. Also amusing is the manner in which the last victim at the motel is dispatched - by pure horror. The skin from the face of her own husband is placed upon hers, where she is left dangling on the back of the door to be found by the screaming maid. She inadvertently does herself in.<br /><br />This film displays, in an albeit base level, the might is right dynamic, and that man is a vicious animal in his most primal state, where so-called principles of 'good and evil' are completely subjective terms, where the clever and ruthless prevail, manipulating where necessary to gain selfish ends, moving the world according to what is placed into action. Perceptions will sometimes be tested in what one perceives is supposed to happen, and what actually can, and does happen.<br /><br />_________<br /><br />* Interestingly, it is noted that some scenes contain subtle 'Star Wars' references from time to time, from a mention of having a Princess Leia fetish, to the subsequent betrayal akin to Calrisian's on Han Solo for Darth Vader.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="For the right target viewer, this works fine. Not for everyone, please read on"></head><body><p>First, I am going to say that if you want an objective review, you'd better read a different review of this film. I went to the theaters as someone who:<br /><br />1.Had read the book, loved it and knew that Will Smith was probably not going to do an exact recreation of that book. That was fine by me. I can accept artistic license, in this case.<br /><br />2.Is a huge fan of Will Smith. I could probably listen to him read the phone book, name by name.<br /><br />3. Loves apocalyptic, vampire and similar movies, even some that others would consider cheesy, campy or just plain dumb.<br /><br />So there are my disclaimers, right up front. If you read on, you do so at your own risk...or because you have a similar mindset. But don't say I didn't warn you.<br /><br />I do suggest that you consider the fact that this book has been considered very hard to put on the screen - and rightly so, as far as I'm concerned. The book, a post-apocalyptic tale of one man surrounded by vampire types - is one of my favorites and I've read and reread it many times. However, I wondered how it'd work as a film adaptation.<br /><br />It isn't true to the book, not in the way a movie like To Kill A Mockingbird or The Yearling attempts to be true to the source material. Even so, I'd recommend this movie. I intend to see it again. Will Smith, generally very watchable on screen, doesn't disappoint and he reveals the unraveling of a man who is in the most desperate of circumstances, unhinged, not sure who is friend or foe or even the complete situation.<br /><br />Smith has the added challenge of appearing as a solo performer for a huge part of the film, a challenge in itself. He held my attention, utterly.<br /><br />Maybe I missed it but I never got the sense that the movie explained why or how there was an illness or disease that wiped out much of the world. Maybe a mutated virus? The cause isn't as important as the situation, a truly ghastly one, one man left amongst a group of vampirish types, crazy and demented.<br /><br /> I couldn't keep my eyes off of Smith's face as he showed a range of emotions, reminding me that the man is an extremely talented actor. If you focus only on the accuracy of the translation of book to film, you'll be setting yourself up for disappointment but if you can let that go....and take this film for what it is...and accept the vision of the director and the acting talents of Smith, you'll be in for one wonderful ride (read my disclaimers above first).<br /><br />Also, I do have to note that the CG special effects bothered me some. I'm not a huge fan of those. Yet I still intend to see the film again, allowing my selective focus to hone in on the areas of the film I loved.<br /><br />I happened to really like 28 Days Later so this might be the type of film that fans of that movie would like, too.</p></body></html>

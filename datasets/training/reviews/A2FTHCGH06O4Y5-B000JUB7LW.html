<meta name="summary" content="beautiful photography, but . . ."></head><body><p>There's something that irritates me greatly about this movie.<br /><br />On the plus side, Cruise's acting is more than passable; the evocation of late 19th-century Japan is convincing; the cinematography, peerless; and the battle scenes, gripping and well-wrought.<br /><br />But . . .<br /><br />Has it ever occurred to anybody that Cruise's character was fighting on the WRONG side?<br /><br />I mean, you've got these boring, stuffy guys in the capital who want to get rid of the samurais, then you have the samurais themselves, living in the mountains in manly splendor like a bunch of maurading Che Guevaras.<br /><br />Except that all those "boring, stuffy guys in the capital" are, when you get right down to it, trying to construct a society BASED ON CONSTITUTIONALISM, CONSENSUAL GOVERNMENT, and THE RULE OF LAW, while the untamed samurai simply long for the perpetuation of the swashbuckling, rule-of-the-strongest-type era in which they were ascendant.<br /><br />In other words, the "villains" of this movie are nothing short of the founders of modern Japan:  the heroes, in my book.  Not just that, but they were exponents of everything we as a civilized society presumably stand for.<br /><br />The samurais of this period -- and in this movie--, though inarguably romantic and daring, were essentially trying to turn the clock back to a time when tribalism, internecine warfare, and general lawless bloodshed were the norm.  In short, these guys were standing squarely in the way of a modern humanistic society informed by values such as meritocracy, egalitarianism, due process, etc.<br /><br />And we're supposed to sympathize with these guys merely because Cruise's character happens upon them?<br /><br />This stuck in my craw so much, it pretty much shouted down every other excellence of the film, and there were a few.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="5 star movie, but this edition loses it 1 star."></head><body><p>One of the great movies of all time. Essentially it is one story for the first 1/2 of the film and another for the 2nd half. But the two stories work so well together it is all the more effective.<br />The cinematography is beautiful and the acting and dialogue is superb. My only probelm is that this digital remastered version is full frame and not widescreen. Will be waiting for a proper edition, remastered and widescreen.</p></body></html>

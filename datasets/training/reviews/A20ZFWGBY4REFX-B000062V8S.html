<meta name="summary" content=""T3"...not better than "T2", but way better than the first!!"></head><body><p>About a couple of days after its release, I managed to check out the highly anticipated "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" at the theater, and let me tell you that the film blew me away! Especially since "T3" has spectacular action sequences and awesome special effects from start to finish! Yet, to me, "Terminator 3" is not better than "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" (which will forever remain one of the best action films of all time), but it is, however, better than the first "Terminator" film from way back in 1984. I do regret them not picking James Cameron to direct "T3", but I do give kudos to director Jonathan Mostow ("U-571") for his intense direction of this film. And guess who's back?! That's right! Superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger ("Collateral Damage") is back in the role that made him a household name..."The Terminator"! Joining him are Nick Stahl ("In The Bedroom"), Claire Danes ("The Hours"), and Kristanna Loken (TV's "Mortal Kombat: Conquest"), in which they gave tremendous performances as well.<p>"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" starts out about 12 years after the events of "Terminator 2: Judgment Day". The apocalyptic prediction of Judgment Day was never prevented, only postponed. John Connor (Stahl), now 22, is living "off the grid" (meaning no credit cards, no cell phone, etc.), being totally disconnected from society. During the film, Connor is being pursued by the T-X (Loken), another ruthless killing machine from the future sent by Skynet, the evil supercomputer that controls machines from all around the world. T-X's mission is to pick up where her predecessor (the liquid metal T-1000) left off: to stop Connor from becoming the savior of mankind. Then, soon enough, an obsolete, disadvantaged T-850 Terminator (Schwarzenegger) arrives from the future to protect Connor and Kate Brewster (Danes), a girl from his past, in triumphing over the technologically superior T-X and forestall the looming threat of Judgment Day...or it will be the end of life as we know it!<p>In conclusion, "Terminator 3" has it all: Action, suspense, a powerful storyline, laugh-out-loud humor that Schwarzenegger can always provide us with, and pulse-pounding special effects! "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" is, without a doubt, one of the best action films that I've seen all summer and will be an unforgettable DVD must-have addition to the first two "Terminator" films!</p></body></html>

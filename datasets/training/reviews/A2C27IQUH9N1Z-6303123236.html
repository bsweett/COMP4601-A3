Snow White has whistles!"></head><body><p>You could never accuse the guys at Disney of being on the cutting edge of progressive social thought, but they sure knew about fun -- and the current crew augments that same idea of fun with the latest technology by coming up with the best bells and whistles I've seen on a DVD.  There are two discs to hold it all -- pretty remarkable when you condsider that the movie itself is only 84 minutes long.<p>The movie looks and sounds great .... a beautiful restoration.  Images are sharp, sound is clear.  You can listen to the original mono soundtrack, or an improved digital track in English or French.  If you choose French, even the opening sequence of a printed fairy tale book appears in French.  Pretty cool.<p>The extras include Streisand singing 'Some Day My Prince Will Come'; a karaoke edition of 'Heigh Ho'; a 39-minute documentary about the making of the film narrated by Angela Lansbury; audio commentary by Walt Disney himself, pieced together from archived materials; an animated short used to test some of the animation; and Dopey's Wild Mine Ride -- a great little trivia/puzzle game -- and that's just the first disk!<p>The second disk is spectacular -- there are dozens of elements here, but I will mention (what I consider to be) the best: storyboard/film comparison; scenes deleted from the film (including a great scene of the dwarves making Snow White a bed, with comments penciled in by an animator); camera tests; featurettes about the voices, audio sessions, restoration of the film, and artistic concepts -- layouts, backgrounds, character sketches and development; publicity materials (posters, photos, trailers, radio commercials); and a timeline of the history of the film *and* Disney studios.<p>The amount (and quality) of extras is truly incredible; and there is a well-designed print brochure, as well as on-disk tours of the material, to help you find your way around.<p>This is a great version of a wonderful film -- and an exemplary use of the DVD format.<p>Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

Hostel: Part II takes the promising set up of his first film and just runs it into the ground with predictability and inaneness.  The film picks up with survivor Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and what he's been up to since the events of the first film, and eventually leads to a trio of girls (Lauren German, Heather Matazarro, and Bijou Philips) that run afoul of the same crew of sadists from the first film.  This time around however, Roth shows us the inside of the organization that preys upon people and uses them as torture victims (one of which, played with excellent creepiness by veteran TV actor Richard Burgi), and this is where Hostel II fails the most.  Roth makes a shallow attempt to get into their heads and ultimately fails, and fails even more so as we get to know the three female leads.  We don't care one bit for the characters or what happens to them, where as at least we did a little bit the first time around when Paxton and his friends ran into trouble.  It is also worth noting that the gore effects are especially grisly and this will be the only reason to check out the Unrated version of the film (if you saw the film in theaters, you were probably wondering just what couldn't make it into the R-rated cut).  Eli Roth has so much potential in becoming one of the next, best directors of the horror genre, but his talent gets wasted here, and hopefully he'll realize that it's time to go a different approach than the new age exploitation route.  You're going to check it out regardless, but don't say I didn't tell you that you're time wasn't better off being used somewhere else.</p></body></html>

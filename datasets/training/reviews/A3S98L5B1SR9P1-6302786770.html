<meta name="summary" content="My favorite western"></head><body><p>I'm not a "western" type of guy, but Sergio Leone's Man with no Name trilogy reeled me in to three of the greatest westerns ever made, starring none other than Clint himself.<br /><br />Nothing compares to this movie in terms of style. Every character has its own charm-be it Clint's reluctant style, or ugly's cunning nature and the cruel "bad" guy (determine for yourself who is good, bad or ugly). The music has become kind of an anthem for the "wild wild west" movies and has been copied the world over. I have seen the movie half a dozen times, still I cannot resist playing the DVD whenever I get time. Would highly recommend it to everyone.</p></body></html>

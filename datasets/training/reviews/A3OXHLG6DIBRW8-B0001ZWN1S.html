This is not your typical gangster movie and it won several Oscars in 1972, including "Best Picture" and "Best Actor" (Brando). The movie gets everything right with a phenomenal cast, perfect settings, and excellent cinematography.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: The story follows the powerful Corleone "mafia" family as they attempt to hold on to their influence in post-WWII NY. The character development is allowed to take place at an unhurried pace as this is a movie that jumps months between scenes, giving us a chance to see how they change over time. This also has some really talented actors, including Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Al Pacino, and, one of my favorites, Abe Vigoda (still alive at the time of this review), that were perfectly cast for their rolls. It was directed by Francis Ford Coppola and it is my favorite movie by him as well. The action is well spaced throughout the movie and it is not needlessly graphic, but certainly feels realistic. The settings and attention to detail makes it easy to forget that wasn't actually made in the 1940s, really helping the viewer to become immersed in the atmosphere. The cinematography was also outstanding, using great perspective shots and often implying more than what was shown.<br /><br />This is definitely a classic that is as good as it is said to be.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></body></html>

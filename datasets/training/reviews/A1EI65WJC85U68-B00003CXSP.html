<meta name="summary" content="HANNIBAL DISHES UP A SMORGASBOARD OF HORROR"></head><body><p>I loved SILENCE OF THE LAMBS &amp; when I read the book of HANNIBAL a while back I started pining for the movie release. HANNIBAL surpasses its predecessor in terms of panache &amp; graphic gore. Anyone expecting Oscar material will be disappointed (&amp; nauseated) with this, but I loved it. Lecter is relatively &quot;normal&quot; in this movie, which I feel makes him all the more terrifying. The plot revolves around one of Lecter's surviving victims, Mason Verger (the always excellent Gary Oldman, in gruesome makeup) plotting to capture Hannibal &amp; feed him to his carnivorous wild pigs, as payment to Lecter feeding his face to a pack of dogs. When Clarice Starling (Juliannne Moore) learns of this she sets out to warn Lecter. Ridley Scott scores another bullseye after his success with GLADIATOR. His expected visual style complements Hopkins' performance well.  Moore meanwhile, manages to step into the role of Starling and make it her own. My only quibble is that Oldman had his name removed from the credits supposedly because he wanted second billing.And for you gorehounds there are several gruesome scenes to savor, including Hopkins introducing Ray Liotta to the pleasures of &quot;brain food&quot;. Yum.</p></body></html>

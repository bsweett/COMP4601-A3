<meta name="summary" content="Furious force of action and suspense"></head><body><p>When action leaped up in mid air and dance like fighting sequences splattered on my screen, the first question I asked myself was "How come I have never heard of this movie before?"  It came and went into the movie theaters like a hushed shadow, yet hundreds of outstanding five star reviews prove it was well received and it did not slip by silently.<br /><br />One can easily assume that Equilibrium is just another action movie, but this hybrid of marital art styles, refined weaponry and stunning fight scenes reached deeper than many movies I've seen of serious topics and non frills entertainment. This movie reminded me of movies such as Kill Bill, V for Vendetta, Aeon Flux and Ultraviolet,  yet the story and theme touched on the rawest foundations of humanity.<br /><br />In the future as wars threatened mankind , drugs replaced all feeling and emotions. There was no art, no books, no fancy clothes, only sterile solemn looking houses and no individuality whatsoever, people looked like they stepped out of an assembly line at a factory. A totalitarian society ruled by a man called Father and his high officials distributed a drug which upon injection sustained the feeling of nothingness. Amongst that society there were real people, those who hid or ran away and tired to keep some of their possessions with them, but they were at risk of an instant and brutal death if found by the Grammaton Clerics, a breed of super cops who sniff out the fugitives. It is amazing what they did in the name of peace, how many people they killed and murdered, makes on think about what is right and what is wrong but carries a good name.<br /><br />One day John Preston (Christian Bale) skips a dose and notices undesirable to him effects taking place. He uses his excellent combat skills to trace reasons of why he should not take it and of what the truth really holds. The story as far fetches as it was, was fun and witty and did not take a trilogy to portray it's message. It was a scary glimpse into the world where all feeling and emotions were suppressed, and when I left my boyfriends house after watching it I thought that the air never smelled so good and the world never looked so fresh before. It made me value the kind of freedom I complain about daily, as non perfect as it is, it sure is better than the life Preston had.<br /><br />There were many twists and turns to the story, secret traitors and hidden agendas and I loved solving it with Preston.  The icing on the cake was the fighting, especially when he used his guns as swords, I real treat to watch! This is a must have movie in anyone's library, especially for action buffs!<br /><br />- Kasia S.</p></body></html>

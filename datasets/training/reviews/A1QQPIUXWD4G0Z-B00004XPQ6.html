In addition to the formulaic cameo shots pointlessly and continuously revolving around Mel; the film is further debased by a pathetic script and horribly gross historical inaccuracies. The story line is generic and can be found in an introductory film class textbook. Mel Gibson's rigid performance kills the film beyond redemption. Shun this film like the plague! Watch 'Last of the Mohicans' or 'Revolution' for films on Revolutionary or Pre-Revolutionary America instead.</p></body></html>

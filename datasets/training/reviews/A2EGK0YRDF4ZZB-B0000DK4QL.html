<meta name="summary" content="Though short, Daredevil offers one heck of a ride"></head><body><p>Daredevil is my first superhero film. No, I didn't see X-Men, Batman, or Spiderman, but from the moment I read the synopsis of Daredevil, it was the only choice for me. I come from the school of tortured souls: Louis from Interview With the Vampire, Nick Knight from Forever Night, Father Kiernan from Stigmata. I want my hero to be both powerful and remorseful. Daredevil is both. <p>Blinded as a child by a freak accident, Matt Murdock's other four senses are hypersensitive. As an adult, Matt is a pro bono lawyer in Hell's Kitchen, but despite his best efforts, his clients don't get justice. By night Matt dons a red leather costume complete with horns and doles out the deserved justice to rapists, murderers and thugs. But he is a tortured soul and seeks spiritual relief in a nearby church, the priest being one of the few that knows of his dual identity as Daredevil.<p>Matt views his gifts as more of a curse: tormented by the extreme noise of the everyday, he sleeps in a sealed chamber. His cupboard is stocked with Vicodin and assortment of painkillers. His body is covered with scars, showing all too well that he is only human. And his life gets more complicated when he meets the beautiful (yet lethal) Elektra. Both Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner bring chemistry and believability to their roles, and there is definitely onscreen chemistry between the two. Matt's faith is tested as he is faced with losing everone and everything he's ever loved at the hands of Kingpin; it's a bitter fight to the finish.<p>The storytelling is at times disjointed, the camera work seizure inducing (made me think of MTVesque Stigmata), the music an ear splitting blend of rock, alternative, and Rob Zombie. The visual and stunt work is incredible, with superhuman leaps, suspended kicks, and weapon trajectories (never knew that paper clips could be lethal weapons, did you?). There are moments of dark humour, most provided by pottymouthed Colin Farrell as Bullseye and Jon Favreau as Matt Murdock's sidekick. Sadly, the love story between Elektra and Matt didn't really play out much, and the film is short (103 min.). I found the ending unsatisfying, although it obviously sets up a sequel. In spite of a few hiccups along the way, Daredevil is one heck of a wild ride.</p></body></html>

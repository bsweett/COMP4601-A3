<meta name="summary" content="The Greatest Mob Movie Ever And One Of The Best Films Ever"></head><body><p>In my three years as a reviewer, I have never faced a more daunting task than reviewing "The Godfather". I thought it would've been hard to review "Dark Side Of The Moon", but I now realize how hard it is to put into words "The Godfather's" effect on pop culture. From the sweeping epic storyline to the brilliant performances (including an Oscar-winning performance by Marlon Brando) to everything in between, everything is so hard to explain.<br /><br />What I can tell you however is that one of the few films in the world worthy of the title "must own". Nobody can have a truly enviable dvd collection without this 1972 cinematic masterpiece directed by Francis Ford Coppolla and featuring a stunning array of some of the film world's greatest talents, including Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a host of others. Unlike most film addaptations, the film stays true to Mario Puzo's ingenius original novel. There are very little differences (I'm sure there are some) between the book and the novel (at least from a general outlook).<br /><br />And back to the acting. It is evident from his first line that Brando never had a finer role than beleagured mob boss Don Vito Corleone. Brando packs an emotional wallop into his performance. From this performance it's easy to see why all of Hollywood still worships at his feet. Al Pacino as his son Michael Corleone proves that he truly was worthy to be Brando's successor, and for the most part retains that status even today ("Gigli" not withstanding). James Caan is brilliant as Sonny, who meets a gruesome end (one of cinema's best deaths) at a toll both. Future Woody Allen cohort Diane Keaton shimes as Kaye Adams, Michael's much put upon girlfriend who loves him yet cannot put up with his violent lifestyle. Robert Duvall plays the adpated Corleone brother, Thomas Hagen, and plays the role to a tee. Talia Shire, though forever remembered as Adrienne from the "Rocky" series, is perfect for Connie, the lone Corleone sister. And the actor who plays Fredo (unfortunately, I forgot his name, John something, I think) is really good and unfortunately passed away at a young age.<br /><br />This is truly an example of a cinematic masterpiece. If you do not own this dvd, you must get it. Otherwise, your dvd collection will be empty without it.</p></body></html>

McAdams is convincing as a young woman in an important job who keeps her cool. We know that something is a little off with her because we see a scar on her chest. She's a customer service maven, a manager of the wealthy Miami Lux hotel, and she's afraid of flying.<br /><br />Murphy on the other hand is a good villain, fairly amoral, not interested in money or companionship, but willing to kill to get his target acquired and then resolved.<br /><br />The other roles are even handed and while they are certainly peripheral, we get a chance to see them interact with McAdams when times are smooth and later on when things become unglued.<br /><br />Kudos as always to Wes Craven who keeps us on the edge of our seats as he weaves the tale one by one closing the doors that lead to any escape of the heroine.<br /><br />It's not a slasher movie. It's just a good old fashioned scary mystery. It does seem to come apart and unravel a little at the ending. But it's not Tolstoy nor does it have any pretentions. Mr. Craven gives us a few hints along the way of what's going to happen: the aforementioned scar. The little girl who has her own will; the big teenagege nervous Nellie with the big pen; the pictute of Lisa (Rachel) and her College Field Hockey stick.<br /><br />I don't know what you guys wanted. I got it all. 5 Stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></body></html>

There are dragons, mermaids, a wicked maze, a new Dark Arts teacher(of course!), and something that hasn't been in the first three films so far--death.  Without giving away too much, just know that "Goblet" takes the viewer straight into the wizarding world, leaving out the Dursleys, trims up the book that it is based on and attempts to give the viewer the meat-and-potatoes version of the novel.<br /><br />The acting is superb, perhaps the best of the film series.  Daniel Radcliffe has grown quite well into his role as young Harry Potter, who is only beginning his years of teenage angst.  Emma Watson has blossomed into a lovely young lady, but Hermione is still just as prissy as she was before.  Rupert Grint has grown up more than any of the other characters both physically and as an actor.  He has a solid handle on Ron.  His twin elder brothers, Fred and George, get a little more spotlight in this film, and Oliver and James Phelps prove to the crowd that they are solid comic performers in this story.  Ginny Weasley(Bonnie Wright) returns in a supporting role.  Robbie Coltrane gets big and tall as Hagrid once again(but in a smaller role).  Of course, Draco(Tom Felton) and his gang are around to torment Harry, but they take a backseat to the Tri-Wizard tournament.<br /><br />Other returning characters include Dumbledore(Michael Gambon), Snape(Alan Rickman), Flitwick(Warwick Davis), and all of the other teachers from Hogwart's, not to mention Jason Isaacs as the wicked Lucius Malfoy.  New characters include Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody, Miranda Richardson as the hilarious Rita Skeeter, Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort, and Katie Leung as Cho Chang.  Three pivotal new characters, the Tri-Wizard competitors, are also introduced in "Goblet."  They are first-time actor Stanislav Ianevski as the athletic Viktor Krum, the lovely Clemence Poesy as Fleur Delacour, and Robert Pattinson as the honorable and trustworthy Cedric Diggory.<br /><br />The story moves at the fastest pace of any of the films so far.  There is some rather rough-and-tumble editing at points in the movie, but you have to give the director, Mike Newell, a mulligan for that considering the length of the book it is based on.  The special effects have greatly improved, and are nearly flawless.  Newell moves the story along at a smooth and quick trot, making the nearly two-and-a-half hour flick move along nicely.<br /><br />This is definitely the darkest film so far.  Folks who brought their young children to the first three films should preview this before allowing their youngsters to watch it.  A good film to measure this against as far as the PG-13 rating goes is any of the "Lord of the Rings" films.  If your child can handle that, they can handle "Goblet."<br /><br />*Potential Spoilers*<br /><br />The death of a prominent character may make this film a little tough for youngsters to view.  Definitely watch the last thirty or so minutes of this film without your child before they can see it.  When Voldemort makes his return, he is a grotesque creature, and Wormtail(Timothy Spall) quickly extinguishes one of the major characters in this tale.<br /><br />Also, the language is a tad bit stronger on this film than in the others.<br /><br />The opening sequence at the Quidditch World Cup comes to a violent end, so you might be wary of that before letting your youngsters view as well.<br /><br />Other than these particular moments, most of this story will be no worse than the other three.  This is an all-around good film, and I don't mean to take away from it by listing these few moments.  However, I don't think that my daughter, who has viewed the other films, should see the ending of this film until she's a little older.<br /><br />The enchanted candy is gone, this is a darker and more violent Harry Potter.  Still, I highly recommend it to fans of the books and the films, as well as anyone who enjoys fantasy flicks.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

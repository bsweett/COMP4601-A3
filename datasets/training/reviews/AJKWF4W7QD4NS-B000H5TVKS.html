<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing sequel"></head><body><p>The first Saw movie was like a breathe of fresh air to the genre.  It wasn't a PG-13 rated teen fest or a remake of a classic 70's horror film either, and while it wasn't perfect, it still managed to deliver the goods with a little bit of originality thrown in.  Saw II picks up where the first film left off, with Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) playing another game with a group of people; among whom is survivor Amanda (Shawnee Smith) and the son (Erik Knudsen) of crooked detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) who is forced to play along as well.  Replacing James Wan as director, Darren Lynn Bousman ups the ante in terms of grotesqueness and the design of Jigsaw's game, but the story (originally based on an older story by Bousman that was later transformed into Saw II) isn't close to being as engaging as it was the first time around, and besides Bell, Smith, and Wahlberg; the rest of the cast (including a returning Dina Meyer, along with Glen Plummer, 7th Heaven's Beverly Mitchell, Franky G, and Emmanuelle Vaugier) range from grating to awful.  There's some pretty good gore effects, and the scenarios offer some imagination, but Saw II is a far step down from the original.  All in all, Saw II isn't horrible, but it's definitely the worst entry in the series by far.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Rear Window with a ghost story twist"></head><body><p>Director Robert Zemeckis gives us your typical suspenseful moments like the mist escaping the bathroom door, the wide angle bathtub shot reminiscent of The Shining, a dog growling at an evil presence, someone opening a door and then when they close it, a person is standing there, and so on.  Seen it all before, but still created suspense nonetheless.<br /><br />Also adding to the movie's suspense is the lighting tricks.  For instance, you'll have a scene that's all dark and then a bolt of lightning will illuminate a figure you didn't know was there.<br />There's also extreme close-up shots that add tension, too.  I especially liked the scene where Michelle Pfeiffer is slowly walking down the stairs backwards and all we're allowed to see is the back of her heels.  It's a very quiet scene and then there's a bang that makes you jump.<br />Not only are these close-up shots unsettling, but I thought they were artistic, too.  One bathtub scene shows us just a woman's legs and it reminded me of a similar painting by Frida Kahlo.<br /><br />There's good special effects in this movie, but what I appreciated most is that these special effects are used sparingly, only when needed.  It annoys me when a movie is all special effects at the expense of a good story.  What's funny is that I've seen this movie several times, but only in my last viewing did I notice at the very end, there's an image of a woman's face in the ice.  It's very subtle, but pretty clever nonetheless.<br /><br />I gave this movie 4 stars only because I thought the ending got a little too unrealistic and silly for my taste.  I also thought the movie could've been edited better (ran a little too long).  And they never explain if that was really blood on the neighbor's shoe.<br />Overall, though, I thought this was a successfully suspenseful movie...kind of like Rear Window with a ghost story twist.</p></body></html>

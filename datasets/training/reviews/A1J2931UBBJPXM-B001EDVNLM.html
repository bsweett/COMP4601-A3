Pierce Brosnan suits up for the fourth time as Secret Agent Man, joined this time around by a lady named Jinx (Halle Berry), who is not only beautiful but demonstrates early on that she can definitely take care of herself; a decidedly capable match for Mr. James Bond.  But whose side is she on, anyway?<p>The film opens with 007 insinuating himself into an operation transpiring in North Korea, where a certain Colonel Moon (Will Yun Lee) is attempting to negotiate a deal to buy South African diamonds in exchange for weapons.  Our man Bond, of course, has replaced the contact and holds the briefcase containing the loot.  As expected, the enterprise quickly deteriorates into an explosive situation, and from that point on the action never stops.<p>Working from a story and screenplay by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (who also teamed for 1999's "The World Is Not Enough," along with Bruce Feirstein), director Tamahori digs deep into the All-Things-Bond box to make this James Bond film...well... everything a James Bond film should be, from the fast paced action (it goes without saying) to the snappy repartee rife with bons mots and double-entendre (at which Berry/Jinx also proves to be a match for Brosnan/Bond) to one of the best "henchmen" (Zao, played terrifically by Rick Yun) since Goldfinger's Oddjob.  There is also a touch of nostalgia thrown in for good measure:  As Q (John Cleese) gives his dissertation on the latest gadgets, Bond casually ferrets through the Quartermaster's cache and comes across the lethal shoe that once belonged to Rosa Klebb, as well as a signature item from "Thunderball."  It's a nice touch that perhaps for the first time tangibly links forty years of "Bond" history together and goes far in dispelling the quite noticeable changing incarnations of 007 over the years; finally, rather than naturally, if subconsciously, categorizing the character into a Connery/Bond, Moore/Bond, Lazenby/Bond, Dalton/Bond or Brosnan/Bond, he's just "Bond."  James Bond.<p>Visually, this one has a lot to offer, with some extravagant sets, a memorable sword fight and special F/X that are, for the most part, top notch.  There is one scene near the end (suffice to say involving a lot of water and some huge waves) in which the F/X seem to dip somewhat below par and actually take on an almost "60s" look (intentional, perhaps, as an homage that would be in keeping with the rest of the film's nod to "Bond" history?) but overall it's a quality production, and the cinematography (by David Tattersall, who also did "Star Wars, Episodes I & II") is brilliant.<p>If ever an actor was meant to play a specific role, it's Pierce Brosnan as James Bond.  From his initial outing as 007 (in 1995's "GoldenEye") he's been a perfect fit, but here he seems to have at last actually settled into the part and made it his own, in a way that Moore, Lazenby and Dalton (for all the individual and unique strengths they brought to their respective portrayals of Bond) were, even at their best, never able to achieve.  Brosnan credibly brings Ian Fleming's unflappable, stalwart hero to life with seemingly effortless aplomb, striking a chord in which the seriousness and the levity that defines the character mesh perfectly (Moore, on the other hand, played up the lightness too often, almost into parody at times; Dalton was altogether too serious; Lazenby was simply an anomaly).  Simply put, Brosnan has all of the qualities that personify James Bond, and he uses them all to the utmost effectiveness.<p>Following up her Oscar winning portrayal of Leticia Musgrove in 2001's "Monster's Ball," Halle Berry, meanwhile, makes her mark as arguably one of the finest "Bond Girls" since Honor Blackman's performance as "Ms." Galore in "Goldfinger" in 1964.  She definitely makes one of the most memorable first entrances from among the rank and file of the Bond Beauties; emerging from the sea in an orange two-piece suit she looks absolutely stunning, calling to mind Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder in 1962's "Dr. No."  Pulchritude aside, however, Berry most importantly makes her character believable, which in no small part lends the necessary support to the anticipated outlandishness of the fiction.  <p>The one female in a recurring role who has yet to be given her due as a "Bond Girl," is a consummate actor who has added significantly to the Bond legacy with her portrayal of "M."  Dame Judi Dench came on board along with Brosnan in "GoldenEye," empowering women everywhere by taking on a highly visible role of absolute authority, albeit fictional, and helping to revitalize the "Bond" series.  Casting her as Bond's superior was a stroke of genius, and the way Dench took over the role and made it her own should at last be acknowledged.  She is, without question, a big part of the renewed strength of the "Bond" of the new millennium.<p>Making her motion picture debut here, Rosamund Pike also adds her name to the roster as Miranda Frost, but though she adds beauty and poise to the film, she is less than charismatic and her performance lacks the kind of spunk that would have made her character more than just adequate.  Still, it would be hard for any actor to get a toehold playing against the radiant Halle Berry, and on a positive note, Pike does lend a decided elegance to the role.<p>As Bond's nemesis, Gustav Graves, Toby Stephens gives an energetic performance and carves out a niche for himself in the annals of Bond bad guys; and with a physical oddity sustained in the opening sequence of the film, Yune makes a lasting impression as Zao.  In the final analysis, "Die Another Day" is the best "Brosnan" Bond yet.</p></body></html>

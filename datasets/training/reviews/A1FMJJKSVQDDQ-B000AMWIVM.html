<meta name="summary" content="First in the series is an absolute must"></head><body><p>I saw this movie a few years ago, and I remember it very well. This is actually a very impressive thriller. It contains lots of high tension, severe gore, and clever plot twists. The actors have done splendid jobs, and the writing is crisp and not too complex. Music is also fantastic, and the cinematography is to die for. I give this an A.</p></body></html>

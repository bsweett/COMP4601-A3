<meta name="summary" content="W. Pulled no punches but was sympathetic"></head><body><p>W. was easily a four star movie which pulled no punches about our X president, but with few exceptions painted a sympathetic portrait of the man.  I think this film was well done and an excellent transfer to Blue Ray DVD. The DVD also included some very interesting historical background for the film, as well as some speculative source material from which it drew. It depicted the president as a very likeable and sociable man who only wanted to do what he sensed was in the best interest of the country.</p></body></html>

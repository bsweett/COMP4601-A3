<meta name="summary" content="Never before has so much blood and gore been wasted on such an atrocious movie"></head><body><p>If this movie were a person, I would devote the rest of my life to hunting him down and making sure he spent the rest of his life in a solitary confinement cell.  I absolutely hated this movie - I hated every single thing about it.  Normally, I love all the blood and gore I can get, but when the movie giving me all that blood and gore is telling me a terrible story and then egregiously insulting my intelligence to boot, I have to yell "Shenanigans!"  And just to rub a little salt in the wound, it's French. Sacre bleu!  How in the world did this movie ever win a single award from any entity even remotely associated with the film industry?  It's the equivalent of naming Yoko Ono female vocalist of the decade.  Come to think of it, I think I would rather listen to Yoko Ono sing for ninety minutes than ever have to suffer through this putrid mess of a film ever again.<br /><br />So what goes on here?  Well, Marie (Cecile de France) goes home one weekend with her college friend Alex (Maiwenn Le Besco), supposedly to study.  Yeah, right.  Anyway, Mr. Magoo could see that Marie (who is an inherently unlikable character, by the way) sees Alex as more than a friend.  After everybody basically turns in for the night, a stranger in a horribly ugly truck invades the house and sets about systematically slashing everyone in the house - well, almost everyone.  He kidnaps Alex, at which point Marie sets out to follow him and free Alex from his clutches.  Basically, the huntee becomes the hunter becomes the huntee.  All the while, blood and gore are the viewer's constant companion.  Sounds like a movie worth watching, doesn't it?  Well, it's not.  For one thing, Marie - well, let's just say that she has obviously never seen Scream because she doesn't know the first thing about how to survive in a horror movie.  I wish I could go into more detail about that here, but it's too germane to the plot.  Oh, yes, the plot.  Just moments into the film, it's pretty obvious what is going to happen.  You don't want to believe any director could be that stupid, though - but this one is.  The last thing the horror genre needs is a director willing to work this hard just so he can insult the intelligence of everyone in his audience.  Blarrgggh!  High Tension makes me want to scream.<br /><br />Speaking of the film's title, I think it's a misnomer because I didn't feel the slightest amount of tension at any point in the story.  I will concede that some viewers will find this movie exceedingly suspenseful; heck, a few will even think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.  That's fine.  In the opinion of this veteran horror fan, though, High Tension is one of the most ineffective, disappointing films I've seen in years.<br /><br />We s Craven actually referred to director Alexandre Aja as the future of horror.  Please, if you know Wes Craven personally, beseech him to seek psychiatric help immediately, as he has quite obviously lost his ever-loving mind.</p></body></html>

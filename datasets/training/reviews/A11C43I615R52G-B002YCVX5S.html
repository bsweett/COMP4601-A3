<meta name="summary" content="Best 2009 Film and one of the Best I've seen!!!"></head><body><p>I never saw a Tarantino film but when I saw the trailers of this one I thought it was funny and the plot was original and inventive. When I saw it on theaters, I absolutely loved the movie. It is so well acted, well written and really really funny. I also liked the way all this people talks in different languages and how this mingles into the story. I didn't mind the violence and I think that adds to the film rich plot. It was dissapointing to see that this excellent film just won one oscar when it deserved best picture, director and screenplay. Of course Cristoph Waltz was brilliant as Hans Landa and he deserved every award that won. Inglourious Basterds is now one of my favorite films and definetely the best of 2009 (alonside with Up).<br /><br />This two-disc special edition DVD does not dissapoint at all. Aside from the picture you got plenty of good extras that adds to the film value. I totally recommend this film and this DVD (except if you own a blu-ray) is the best way to see it.<br /><br />Now I'm gonna see Pulp Fiction.</p></body></html>

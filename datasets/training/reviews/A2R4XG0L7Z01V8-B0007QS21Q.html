Most of the budget was obviously blown on the CGI and miniatures effects. Most of the CGI is quite impressive, although very occasionally the back projection does look a bit iffy, but it only lasts a couple of seconds at most.<br /><br />I, Robot is set in 2035, and most of the futuristic elements are subtle rather than the in-your-face ones say for example from Demolition Man or Back To The Future II. Apart from the severely high rise buildings, there's also spherical wheels on the vehicles (which meant they could go in any direction), more of the self-drive, and the car doors swinging upwards a la Delorean. The production designers and conceptual artists had a great time imagining a progression of today's world.<br /><br />When I think of robots, for some reason I now automatically think of Bicentennial Man, rather than the robot design in this. They're not very friendly looking, but I suppose Alex Proyas wanted to put his own stamp on the robot design, rather than follow in the generic type featured in some other films.  Maybe he wanted the robots to look vaguely humanoid but still obviously robotic, rather than the cyborg type.<br /><br />I always find with Will Smith that he quite often does play the same character, much like the way Tom Cruise is getting. He's still got elements of Fresh Prince about his character, despite being over a decade on from that now, and with a lot more muscles. He's nearly always the funny guy, with the one-liners. He's always been good at the action side of things, all 6ft 2 of him (which he's been since he was 13!), but there's still the funny guy waiting to burst out with a hilarious one liner that will have everyone rolling in the aisles. For all the ladies out there, we get to see Big Will himself in the shower, in profile. The film is worth the price just for that scene alone. And the two scenes where he gets out of bed in boxers. Unless you're a heterosexual guy.<br /><br />For me, I wasn't overly keen on this film. It wasn't a really, really, good film, but on the other hand it wasn't a really, really bad film. It was kinda stuck in the middle, but not in a good way. Not to be sexist, but apart from the scenes in the shower, it was more a guy's kinda film. There were some scenes glossed over, like the story of how Will's character came to be partially cybernetic, which led me to believe that he was a robot, Terminator-esque. He wasn't.<br /><br />The two disc special edition which was released in the UK has a multitude of extras on it, including commentaries (does anyone ever bother with these?); a 44 minute making of documentary; extensive production diaries; CGI effects breakdowns etc. They were reasonably good, if you're into that sort of thing, but I'm finding I watch extras on the DVD less & less now, only if it's a blooper reel, or a film I really, really like.<br /><br />Overall, a film that could have been better, and could have been worse. And I'd like an order of Will Smith in the shower on the side with that. From now on, lets just have all Will Smith films featuring him in the shower.</p></body></html>

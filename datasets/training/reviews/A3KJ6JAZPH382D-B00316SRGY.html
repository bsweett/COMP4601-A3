But watching Clint Eastwood play a cranky old racist who finally gets melted by a pair of adolescent Asian immigrants felt wholly contrived to me. Walt (Eastwood) has shiftless and greedy family members who he can't stand, neighbors that disgust him, a young priest who he treats like a punk and a few old cronies at the bar he can make racist jokes with. But when he discovers the kid who first tried to steal the Gran Torino of the film's title ain't the gang-banging type, Walt decides he will make a real man out of the kid and make up for the failed sons he thinks he didn't teach right.<br /><br />Which makes him the Cop from the even worse movie, "Crash." "Gran Torino" earns its fourth star based on Eastwood, who plays Walt with such effortless slyness that he manages to coast through the movie on sheer force of will. The other is the teenage Hmong sister Sue (Ahney Her), who has picked up American spunk and sasses to Walt in a manner that makes him learn acceptance (sort of). When Walt stops a bunch of gang members from attacking Sue and her brother (with the infamous "Get off my lawn" trailer quote), Walt becomes their reluctant hero...and the gang's new enemy.<br /><br />As the conflict builds and Walt moves towards the inevitable gang showdown, "Gran Torino" stumbles. I could guess the ending from a mile away, and seeing the previously stone-cold racist Walt suddenly make this kind of turn-about felt too "feel-good" to not ring false. Anyone but Eastwood would have made this a car-wreck, but in his skilled hands, "Gran Torino" remains a decent movie to watch.</p></body></html>

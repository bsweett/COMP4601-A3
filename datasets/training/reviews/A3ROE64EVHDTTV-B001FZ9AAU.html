There is some graininess to the picture, but it is still sharp, clear, colorful, and vivid.<br />*Includes a vast number of great special features; 23 minutes of deleted/extended scenes, interviews, documentaries, stuff that explores Iron Man's suit, trailers, and a mock newscast by the Onion website.<br />*Smashing special effects and action scenes.<br />*Good, straightforward filming style. A few scenes in the beginning had me worried, because they had some weird jumping camera effects, but most of the movie's style is slick and smooth.<br />*Very good, sleek production designs and costumes.<br />*Pretty good, straightforward story. Contains a good mix of action, comedy, drama, and a smidgeon of romance.<br />*Good themes and imagery reflecting modern-day conflicts in the world, and the role major business play in it (a little similar to "Lord of War", but not as serious).<br />*Pretty good characters; pretty good acting. In fact, the main character is better developed than I thought he would be. Much of the story revolves around his evolution from a cold-hearted entrepeneur into an empathetic hero.<br />*Look out for Stan Lee's cameo, once again!<br />*Great sound effects.<br />*Awesome music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*One or two slow parts. The really cool stuff doesn't happen until at least 30 minutes into it. But it's still not too dull at all.<br />*Some violence may be too much for young children (rated PG-13).<br /><br />Once you get into it, this is quite an exciting and slick superhero movie. Much of the action and effects are quite memorable. The characters are not too shabby. The story has enough of everything to keep it engaging, even when there's nothing happening. Moreover, it has some subtle elements reflecting modern-day issues (with terrorism and arms dealing). It is quite enjoyable, and would rank it as being better than "The Fantastic Four."</p></body></html>

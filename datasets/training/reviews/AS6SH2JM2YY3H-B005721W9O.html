<meta name="summary" content="The perfect mix of sci-fi, comedy, and action!"></head><body><p>How do the actors in Star Trek behave when they take their costumes off and go home?  What do they do years after the series has been canceled?<br /><br />And just what DOES happen to those radio signals of old Star Trek (and Gilligan) shows escaping the Earth, and traveling outwards at the speed of light?<br /><br />The Thermians discovered these "historical documents" (unfortunately for the Thermians, they had not invented fantasy, lying, or acting), and develop their society based on the principles of "Galaxy Quest" (a mock version of Star Trek) and its crew.  But another race is now fighting the Thermians, and winning.  The Thermians need the commander of the ship, the NSEA Protector.  They don't need the Protector, however, because, based on the historical documents, they built their own.<br /><br />Thus the adventures begin.<br /><br />The similarities to the original Star Trek series are interspersed throughout, and done well.  The bad dudes are very bad, and the Thermians are really just lovable.  No wonder they are losing!  But the key element of this movie is the transformation of the Protector's crew from actors to space-faring adventurers.  The vital connection they have with their groupies back on Earth is also well done.<br /><br />Great movie!  The extras include the deleted scenes, which you won't find on the earlier VHS editions.</p></body></html>

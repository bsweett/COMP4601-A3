<meta name="summary" content="A thoroughly entertaining comedy"></head><body><p>Failure to Launch is a pretty entertaining film with an above average cast.  It's downright stupid in some ways, but it knows enough to just run with the story all the way through.  I was probably most interested in seeing how a constantly amusing Terry Bradshaw did in an actual comedy - not bad at all, really (even though I saw way, way more of him than I expected or ever wanted to see).  Of course, it helps that he's working alongside a world class actress like Kathy Bates, and the two of them do have some nice chemistry together in terms of the give and take.  Matthew McConaughey plays his leading role just right, if you ask me, reinforcing the somewhat farcical nature of the comedy.  As for Sarah Jessica Parker (who seems to be morphing into Madonna, which is sort of weird), there's that old Square Pegs bond still working in her favor.  Like many, though, I thought Zooey Deschanel really stood out from the rest of the cast - but maybe that's just because I find sarcastic morbidity strangely attractive.<br /><br />There must be something in the water wherever this story takes place, as you have a whole group of thirty-something men refusing to move out of their parents' houses (that's what "failure to launch" refers to, by the way).  These aren't nerds we're talking about, either.  Just look at Tripp (McConaughey), for example; he does all right for himself, never having to struggle to find female companionship, yet he feels compelled to nip every relationship in the bud at the first sign of "the look" in the girl's eyes.  All he has to do is bring the girl home, let her find out he still lives with his parents (Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates), and wave goodbye as she hustles out the door.  Now his folks love their son, but they also think it's way past the time for him to leave the nest - he's 35, for Pete's sake.  They can't just throw him out, of course - but there's another option.<br /><br />Enter Paula (Parker), a professional kicker out of nests.  Tripp's parents hire her to date their son, get him to fall in love with her, and thereby compel him to move out of their house already.  It's almost too easy, as Tripp follows Paula's lead every step along the way.  But, wouldn't you just know it, business and pleasure start to meld in Paula's heart and mind, setting up a chain of events Mr. Magoo could see coming five miles away.  Obvious as the ending is, it still works surprisingly well.  The transformation of Paula's roommate Kit (Deschanel) is just as interesting as the Tripp-Paula roller coaster ride of love, as she goes from a depressed semi-lunatic haunted by a mockingbird to a rather winsome lass who finds happiness without losing the dark edge that makes her so mysterious and interesting.<br /><br />The story isn't perfect, but its weaknesses don't seem to matter all that much as you watch it play out, largely because the film is consistently funny throughout.  Upon reflection, though, you realize that some plot details really weren't developed sufficiently - the whole nephew thing being a case in point.  I also can't approve of the way a couple of animals are treated in this film, yet even the most bothersome incident ended up being the funniest scene in the entire movie.  That's sort of Failure to Launch in a nutshell.  With its formulaic story, it really should be just another average film - but the fact of the matter is that it's well above average in terms of its entertainment value.</p></body></html>

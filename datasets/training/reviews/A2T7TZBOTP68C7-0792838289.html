The definition of unsettling is seeing crooner and movie musical star Frank Sinatra giving an Oscar-worthy performance as a terrified man who is in way over his head in a conspiracy he does not understand.<br /><br />This movie had my head spinning with it's description of a powerful corporation and a shadow government.</p></body></html>

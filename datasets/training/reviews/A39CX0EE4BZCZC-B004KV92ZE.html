Yes, it was beautiful artwork but I read where it was the most beautiful animation ever put on screen, and I didn't find it lived up to that.<br /><br />I guess my expectations were sky high, which made it almost impossible to meet. The story could have used more laughs, too. I think that was the main thing that slightly disappointed me: the humor was mild, not laugh-out-loud funny.<br /><br />Having said all that, it was enjoyable and it will put numerous smiles on your face as you watch it. I guess "pleasant," "agreeable," "warm," etc., would be better words to describe the film. It is pretty, too, especially on Blu-Ray. I imagine this looked awesome on IMAX in the theater.<br /><br />Jack Black does a nice job of voicing the main character, "Po," the panda that surprised everyone, including himself, on what he could achieve if he set his mind to it. That's another plus for the film: nice messages.<br /><br />Kids should like this more than adults but grownups will enjoy it, too.</p></body></html>

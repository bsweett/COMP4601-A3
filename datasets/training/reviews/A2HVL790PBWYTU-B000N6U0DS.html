Now, certain facts have been altered a bit, ostensibly, for better dramatic consumption. Three examples of changes that were wrought are: back in 1981, Chris actually had custody of his infant son, not a five year old; instead of being unpaid, he did receive a meager stipend in his brokering internship; and Chris's wife Linda is fully fictionalized in the film. Whether such changes work or are even needed is, of course, left for you to decide. What's not up to debate is the quality of man it takes to pull off an underdog story like this. The real Chris Gardner must've been (and, presumably, still is) a formidably resilient man who made his own luck, who remained undeterred by a life that was kicking him to the curb.<br /><br />The film's plot: THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS (The misspelled "happyness" originates from an outside mural displayed on the crappy Chinatown day care center to which Chris sends his son) is set in 1981, in San Francisco. Go-getter Chris Gardner (Will Smith), who had been an excellent student as a child but who now, as an adult, feels he's basically amounted to nothing, is eking out a hand-to-mouth living as an unsuccessful hawker of a hospital equipment called a bone density scanner, which proves to be a flop with the medical community. With a young 5 year old and an increasingly bitter wife to provide for, it's tough going for Chris. In fact, it's his wife Linda (a worn down, shrewish Thandie Newton), who toils in multiple shifts and, more often than not, furnishes the capital. Linda finds this lifestyle too unbearable and soon takes off for New York. Upon the insistence of Chris, she reluctantly leaves their son Christopher (Jaden Smith) in his care. Bye bye, Linda.<br /><br />Chris has a plan. A few scenes back, a fleeting encounter with a friendly stockbroker sporting a red Ferrari - who informed him that all one needed to have success in stocks was to be "good with people and good with numbers" - had impacted him enough  that he had decided to become a stockbroker himself. A month of persistence (or, basically, politely hounding an executive outside his brokerage building and then impressing him with his Rubik's Cube skills) lands him an interview for a prospective 6-month internship program with the prestigious Dean Witter firm, with the possibility of being hired at internship's end. He passes the interview and is offered a spot in the program, despite showing up dressed like a transient (a long story, involving paint, parking tickets, and prison). However, to his dismay, he finds that it is an unsalaried internship; after some long, hard thinking, he decides to still go for it, while re-dedicating himself to selling more of his bone density scanners to make ends meet.<br /><br />Of course, things go bad immediately. With his wife and her steady income gone, Chris struggles badly. He runs afoul of the landlord, the IRS, and, in one kinda funny sequence, of one dogged taxi driver. He does manage to sell a scanner, only to have his finances subsequently confiscated by the IRS. Down to literally mere dollars, he and his son succumb to poverty and become homeless; they find themselves forced to wait in line for hours to get into homeless shelters and, when not getting in the shelter, having to spend nights in public rest rooms. Meanwhile, during the day, Chris dons his business attire and attends his internship. He finds it difficult to compete with the other 19 aspirers in the program as they manage to put in 9 hours daily, whereas he's only able to spend 6 hours in the firm (he has to pick up his son from day care, catch the bus, get in line for the shelter, etc). To compensate, while in the firm, he doesn't drink water (thus, less time in the bathroom) and keeps the phone constantly in hand (discovering he gains 8 minutes by doing so). As the 6 months of internship continue to elapse, things get progressively worse for the Gardner family. And then the last day of internship comes...<br /><br />I won't lie, it's a pretty dark, gloomy film; but there's a beauty and a sincerity to it. THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is imbued with a certain stark honesty, depicting Chris' struggles as he copes with his internship while simultaneously walking that tightrope between life on and off the streets. This film is sentimental without being too cloying and contains enough levity to thankfully provide a much-needed counterpoint to the main character's dreary, ever worsening plight.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this film. It's 180 degrees away from the normal, breezy Will Smith flick. Although he's done serious cinema in the past, he's never put as much of his soul and his heart as he does in this one. It's evident that PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is a personal project of his. One reason for his emotional investment is, undeniably, the casting of young Christopher, unaffectedly portrayed by Jaden Smith, who happens to be Will Smith's real life son. Their natural chemistry is what makes this whole shebang works. The bond between the two is a delight to behold. If there's any doubt that Will Smith is genuinely a nice guy, his sweet, easy relationship with his son should dispel any doubt, if there were any, to begin with. Young Jaden Smith is a fresh, new talent who is effectively unmannered in his acting and also delivers with some pretty good kid jokes.<br /><br />I've never had any doubts that the Fresh Prince can act. He proved that early on in SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION. Will Smith was also great in ALI, and he is equally charismatic here as he unveils a focused commitment to dramatic acting. Once again, his innate likability holds him in good stead. There are moments in the film where he'll make you positively weep. Witness his performance as he and Christopher are forced to spend a night in a BART station men's room, or the fleeting look of bleakness which crosses his face when he's forced to relinquish his last five dollar bill to loan his boss cab fare, and, brilliantly depicted, the held-in-check emotions he displays in the movie's culminating moments when he finds out he just got hired (c'mon, you did know he was gonna get the gig, right?). I wouldn't be at all surprised if an Oscar nomination is in the offing.<br /><br />So what else can I say to convince folks to check this film out? This movie is fairly stark without being patronizing, hopeful without being saccharine. Yes, there are several patented Hollywood moments (how could there not?), but these are curtailed by Smith's awesomely gritty performance. His protagonist is a man of big smarts whose dignity, optimism, perseverance, resilience, and love for his son never flag. Chris Gardner realizes, too, that resorting to bitterness and anger isn't the answer. Instead, throughout his travails, he maintains his composure, his wits, his smile, and his warmth, qualities which inevitably carry him to the summit. This movie is emotional, heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting. I'm so glad I saw it.</p></body></html>

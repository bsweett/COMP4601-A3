<meta name="summary" content="More moving than I had expected"></head><body><p>SPOILERS below!!<br /><br />This is not your typical creature feature/horror/action fest of a movie.  Will Smith deserves a lot of credit for imbuing the character of Robert Neville with determination, sadness, desperation, and basic humanity in the face of unimaginable danger and desolation.<br />He believes he is the only man left on Earth, so we can't even imagine the depths of his loneliness.  Having watched his wife and daughter die, the only things keeping him going are the quest for a possible cure for the killer virus (which has destroyed most humans and turned the remainder into murderous freaks; and the love of his loyal family dog, Sam.<br />  Two scenes in particular are extremely moving and sad:  the infection of Sam, whom Robert has to put down before she turns on him; and a scene in which he begs a mannequin to say hello to him because he has heard no other human voice besides his own in three years.<br />  It was a bit simplistic to include scenes in which a woman and her son find Robert and he at first declares that there is no survivors' camp and no God--and then later he decides they were meant to find him because they can carry the cure (in the form of a vial of blood) with them to Vermont, where survivors do, in fact, live.<br />  Don't let that keep you away, though.  This is a well-done story of a man, his dog, and the fight to keep the human race going.</p></body></html>

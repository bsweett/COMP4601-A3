<meta name="summary" content="AVP sequel not so great"></head><body><p>I was really disappointed in the direction this sequel went.  There was absolutely no scare factor that Aliens is known for.  Nothing new that you didn't already know about Predators.<br /><br />If you remember from the last movie, at the end, an alien spawn burst out of a deceased Predator.  Thus, an alien/Predator hybrid and made its way to Earth and attacking on humanity.  Another Predator investigates and learns of a hybrid and takes off to hunt it down.<br /><br />That pretty much it.  Humans are just in the way of the hybrid and the Predator is doing its best to track it down and kill it.<br /><br />Like I said, no scare factor.  No build-up of suspense.  The whole thing just felt rushed.  Just plain disappointing.</p></body></html>

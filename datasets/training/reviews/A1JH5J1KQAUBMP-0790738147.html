Three officers symbolize the directions the department might take: Bud White (Russell Crowe), violent and flexible with his ethics; Ed Exley (Guy Pierce), a by-the-book opportunist; and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), plugged into the show business scene and eager to remain so.  A massacre at a coffee shop starts a series of events that will offer each of these morally conflicted men a measure of redemption.<br /><br />This film boasts a huge cast of characters and a complex storyline but never confuses.  Director/co-screenwriter Curtis Hansen deserves high praise, as does his marvelous cast.  This film has tremendous atmosphere and feels absolutely authentic.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

With all the hype surrounding it, there was little chance it could live up to expectations; sadly, it didn't even come close.  The problems with the film are manifold, and it's difficult to assign blame to any one party.  It starts with the script.  The story is promising - an all-powerful alien "thing" is approaching Earth and the Enterprise is sent to stop it.  This was the premise used very successfully in many Old Series episodes ("Obsession," "Doomsday Machine," and "Immunity Syndrome" being the best), and was later used in ST IV.  However, instead of patterning the story off these episodes, the screenwriters instead chose the dreadful "Changling" as their template.  When they borrowed from Kubrick's 2001, they chose the incomprehensible (and dull) end segments instead of the wonderous science fiction elements.<p>Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there.  The actors are not in character (except Deforest Kelley, who does his best to infuse some semblance of humanity into the inhumane plot).  Director Wise shares some of the responsibility for this with the actors.  In addition, the effects overshadow the dialogue, the exact reverse of what ST stands for.  Because the effects had cost so much, the studio execs (apparently) demanded they get the screen time.  It's not that the individual effects sequences are grossly long, but each one is a little too long, and the cumulative effect is to grow very bored with them. <p>Having said all that, the movie does have good points.  There are flashes of the old Kirk/Spock/McCoy triad that foreshadow better films to come.  The special effects are very impressive, if overlong.  Kirk tries his old standard of trying to talk the alien machine into self-destructing, and when that fails he switches to bluffing it instead.  The score is top-notch.  These items cannot rescue the film overall, however.<p>This new DVD director's cut is better than the original theatrical release (but not as good as the television version).  Many scenes were re-editted with different takes/dialogue, and many new effects (with CGI) were added, and they blend in seamlessly with the old.  The sound is an improvement, but there is still some graininess with the picture (apparently they chose to leave it that way, which is bewildering).  In addition to this new edit and effects, the DVD has a large array of extras, many of which are among the best I've seen.  The text commentary by ST guru Michael Okuda is like a Pop-up Video compilation of nifty facts, such as where sets were re-used in later films/TV series, trivia on the cast and effects, etc.  There are some making-of commentaries, the most interesting is a look at the aborted second series "Phase 2," including costume screen tests.  One welcome addition is the inclusion of all the old versions and cut sequences that were in the original theatrical and video cuts of the film, so we can see how they have been changed for the director's cut (George Lucas - pay attention to this when you make the DVD's for Star Wars!).<p>Therefore, I recommend this DVD for any Star Trek fan, based on the extras more than the film itself.  If you are a very casual fan, I would recommend Star Trek II-IV as being far superior (and enjoyable) films.  Hopefully the success of this director's cut DVD will inspire the release of all the Star Trek movies in this format (i.e. double-disc sets with lots of extras).</p></body></html>

To be quite honest, it was a huge letdown. It was still semi entertaining (hence the 3 stars), but it took itself way too seriously. Keira Knightly is as hot as ever and is the standout as the sexy yet tough Guinevere. Clive Owen was okay as King Arthur, but my biggest complaint is that annoying Lancelot and the absense of Merlin (save for a couple of short scenes). If you aren't going to have Merlin be a larger part of the film, don't have him in it at all. And please don't go in this film expecting the true history on Arthur, this film is just more theories strung together to make stupid audience members say "I didn't know that." Some of the action scenes were well done (Ice Battle), but I would wait to see this one on Dvd. Save your money and catch "The Village" and "Alien vs. Predator" which will both be out within the next month.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="**** GRIPPING STUFF ****"></head><body><p>For a couple of years now (since Tigerland) Colin Farrell has been much vaunted as the next big thing but with the exception of his supporting role in Speilberg's Minority Report, Farrell's subsequent additions to his CV have hardly enhanced his reputation. Movies such as Hart's War and The Recruit have left both audiences and critics somewhat underwhelmed, whilst the release of Phone Booth was much delayed due to the real life Washington snipers mindless killing of innocent people. <p>So what of Phone Booth: Is it any good and does Colin Farrell deserve the tag of next big thing? <p>Farrell plays Stu Shepard a slimy, unscrupulous, and very small time, Manhattan PR man with a daily habit of using the same old fashioned phone booth to call a prospective client (Katie Holmes) with whom he is trying to start an affair with. After all he wouldn't want his wife to see a mobile phone bill listing calls to other women, would he? Enticed into picking up the ringing phone, Stu becomes trapped by an unseen sniper who tells him that he will be killed if he tries to leave the booth or puts down the phone. 'What do you want?' demands Stu,  'I want your complete attention' replies the sniper (Kiefer Sutherland) and not only does he get Stu's complete attention he gets the audiences too as we watch Stu unravel into a [weak] mess pleading for his life over the next seventy minutes. <p>With his cocky charm, good looks and uncanny ability to mimic an American accent, Farrell is perfect for the part, which was at one point reportedly earmarked for Will Smith. The Dublin born actor appears to revel in playing the anti-hero forced into confessing his sins by the psycho sniper playing God in order to achieve some form of redemption. There are good supporting performances too from the likes of Forrest Whittaker as the cop in charge at the scene and in particular Kiefer Sutherland as the menacing assassin at the other end of the line.  <p>Written by veteran writer/producer/Director Larry Cohen and Directed by Joel Schumacher, responsible for the very lamentable Batman & Robin, Phone Booth is (in my humble opinion) a very exciting and claustrophobic edge of the seat thriller. Cohen's script and Schumacher's Direction keep the movie lean and tight, steadily cranking up the tension to new heights right up until the movies conclusion. Cohen's script is so ingenious in that it takes an old movie premise (the irresistible ringing phone that has to be answered and the anonymous caller) and gives it a new spin. It's almost hard to believe that this is the same Joel Schumacher responsible for the last two movies of the Batman franchise. Indeed this is very much a return to form for the man that brought us the urban thriller "Falling Down". Keeping you hooked throughout its (by current standards) relatively short running time, it is refreshing to see the old adage that less is sometimes more once again proved true. <p>..., this is top-drawer entertainment and the best thriller I've seen in a long while. There are certainly much worse ways to spend 81 minutes, so take my advice and give this one a try, I'm sure you wont regret it!!! Four stars ****.</p></body></html>

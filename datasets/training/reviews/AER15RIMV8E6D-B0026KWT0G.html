<meta name="summary" content="Jason in Another Dimension!!!"></head><body><p>This is one of my favorite Friday the 13th films! One of the reasons is because he finally gets his infamous hockey mask! This has the plot of some young adults going to an abandoned house for the weekend, and Jason happens to show up. This one does it well, but Part 4,5, and 7 pretty much do the same thing. Chris, Debbie, Andy, Shelly, Vera, Chuck and Chili stay at a farm house in the woods, hoping to have a good time, but Jason comes and crashes the party. I highly recommend FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3 3-D!!!</p></body></html>

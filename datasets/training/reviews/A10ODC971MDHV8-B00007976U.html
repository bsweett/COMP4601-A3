<meta name="summary" content="One Hour Photo"></head><body><p>Shudder-inducing thriller marks an impressive writing/directing debut for Mark Romanek, and after "Insomnia", another virtuoso, non-comedic turn by Williams. This tale of "Sy, the photo guy" hits uncomfortably close to home, evoking countless people we casually encounter every day, human beings whose apparent isolation we instinctively turn away from. This ingenious film plays out what might happen if any of us got a little too friendly with the wrong individual. "One Hour Photo" will make you grateful that someone finally invented the digital camera.</p></body></html>

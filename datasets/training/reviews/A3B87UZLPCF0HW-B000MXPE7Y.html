<meta name="summary" content="De Niro back in the Director's chair--good"></head><body><p>De Niro's first outing in the director's seat since his 1993 debut A Bronx Tale is an in-depth look at the birth of the CIA as seen through the eyes of one of its first agents, Edward Wilson (Damon). Wilson, recruited by the OSS - a counter-intelligence unit - during WWII, is approached by General Bill Sullivan (De Niro) to help build an organization to be the "eyes and ears, not the heart and soul" of the United States. Wilson throws himself into his work, but Cold War paranoia takes over and, distrusting all around him, his job has dire consequences for his marriage (to Jolie), his family and his sanity. The Good Shepherd is a nuts-and-bolts, behind-the-scenes peek at a spy genre - the flipside to The Bourne Identity, the paperwork behind a James Bond mission, a cloak-and-dagger film without the dagger. Pretty good I would say.</p></body></html>

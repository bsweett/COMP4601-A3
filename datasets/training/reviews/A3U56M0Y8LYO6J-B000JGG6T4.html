It's my job to arrange the meeting.""></head><body><p>Tony Scott's "Man on Fire" is one of the better revenge flicks to come along in recent years.  It is a visually-dazzling film anchored by a bevy of fine performances.<br /><br />Ex-CIA operative Creasy (Denzel Washington) heads to Mexico to visit his friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken) and to find employment.  His skills land him a job as the personal bodyguard of Pita (Dakota Fanning), the daughter of a Mexican businessman.  As fate would have it, the young girl is soon abducted while under his care.  When Creasy recovers from the wounds he sustained in the kidnapping, he embarks on a vengeance-fueled quest to punish those responsible for taking Pita.<br /><br />"Man on Fire" has an uncompromising tone that many studio films shy away from these days.  It is a welcome throwback to the savage revenge flicks from prior decades that were made with little concern for those viewers with delicate sensibilities.  Washington turns in a tour-de-force performance that is filled with passion and ire.  You cannot take your eyes off of him when he is on screen.  Fanning distinguishes herself also and serves notice that she is an actress with a bright future ahead of her.  Furthermore, the supporting cast sparkles as Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Mickey Rourke, and Walken all hit the right notes.  Walken in particular is outstanding in a part that contrasts sharply with the more eccentric roles he usually finds himself in.  "Man on Fire" does have some problems with its ending but the film as a whole is still immensely watchable.  A bullet always tells the truth indeed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Terrific  Depiction Of Sixties Rock Scene!"></head><body><p>It is an old literature axiom that all good fiction is autobiographical, meaning of course that among other things, writing believably and well about any subject requires not only knowing something about it but understanding it as well. That this idea has merit is substantiated by this remarkable period piece both written and directed by Cameron Crowe. As he did in his quite captivating original screenplay for "Fast Times At Ridgemont High", he mines his personal background with an uncanny ear for realistic situations, dialogue, and personal experience to pull us deep into the quirky and sometimes surrealistic world of sixties rock<p>The protagonist of the film is a teen-something reporter for Rolling Stone magazine, and like Crowe, has an eyes-wide-open view of everything swirling around him, from sex, drugs and rock and roll to all the happenings associated with the rock and roll lifestyle itself. One finds William (newcomer Patrick Fugit) sucked into the vortex of a fictitious rock band's pulsating experience, and the moment to moment happenings surrounding Stillwater are so realistic, believable, and palpable that we roll along with it all, finding too much to remember from what we recall of the sixties. Also excellent are the ensemble of supposed Stillwater rock musicians, from Billy Crudup to Jason Lee, and the very lovely Kate Hudson showing her future potential as a leading lady in a powerful and convincing role here. <p>This is the closest any of us are likely to come to living vicariously in a rock and roll band. The fact is that Cameron Crowe actually did experience a lot of what goes down here himself as a sixteen year old reporter, and the verve and energy in the film owes to this authentic recollection of those times, and to his uncanny ear for all the elements of the rock scene. This is a terrific movie, and although it is fiction, is also quite representative of the times it purports to describe. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

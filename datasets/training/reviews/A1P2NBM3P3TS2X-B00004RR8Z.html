You could spend a couple of weeks watching and reading all the extras, commentaries, script drafts, etc.  But by then you would have deconstructed the films so much that you have robbed them of whatever &quot;innocent viewing pleasure&quot; you enjoyed before you delved into the minutiae of the extra features.<p>So it is a double-edged sword:  Learn more than you ever thought you would about the 4 &quot;Alien&quot; films, but suffer having to watch them from then on and forever more through the filter of &quot;knowing too much behind-the-scenes info&quot; &amp; &quot;curtain-pulled-back-on-the-Wizard&quot; insider perspective.<br /><br />That said, it is a real treat to have this collection, even though the fourth film was abominably disappointing.  The packaging, which opens to a nearly five foot long foldout, is kind of neat but soon grows cumbersome and irritating.  When you unfold it the first time, it is like &quot;Hey, look what THIS thing does!&quot;.  But after a while, when you just want to retrieve a single disc for some occasion, it has evolved to &quot;Okay, okay, I get it - it's long.  Just gimme the stupid disc already!&quot;<p>For &quot;Alien&quot; fanatics, this is a must-have.  I don't own the &quot;Alien Legacy&quot; set, so I can't compare them.<p>I especially like the DTS sound on two of the films.  DTS always brings a new dimension to the listening experience that the still-great Dolby 5.1 doesn't.<p>Don't complain about the price, either.  You get your money's worth in spades, and you save on tax and get free shipping if you order it online (from the right vendor).  Besides, even if the price is a bit too steep for you, that amount of your money would have been lost to the sands of time soon enough anyway.  Might as well spend the money and have something cool to show for it.</p></body></html>

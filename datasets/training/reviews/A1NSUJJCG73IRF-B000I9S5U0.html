<meta name="summary" content="Cinderella Man  (2005)"></head><body><p>Director:  Ron Howard<br /><br />Cast:  Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger, Paul Giamatti, Craig Bierko, Paddy Considine, Bruce McGill, David Huband, Linda Kash, Nicholas Campbell.<br /><br />Running Time:  145 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for boxing violence and some language.<br /><br />The formula for the perfect sports drama is certainly one that all movie-goers know by heart and directors worry until they are scrapping their bald scalps for some way to create an original "Rocky"-esque fairy tale masterpiece and eventually come to their senses-the originality of the great American sports drama is what makes them so entertaining.  The excellent, heart-warming tale of the legendary boxer James J. Braddock, told through the eyes and ears of director Ron Howard, is represented with great original compassion in "Cinderella Man".  The film does not try to throw any sucker punches with obscure plot twists, racial integration undertones, or shock the viewer with its riveting, edge-of-your-seat, show-stopping, popcorn-flying-off-the-lap, special effects dilapidated , hard-hitting climax; instead it provides a very realistic, historical account of one of the greatest American heroes of the Great Depression.<br /><br />Russell Crowe coagulates himself as perhaps the best actor of the past decade (with a resume that consists of starring roles in "L.A. Confidential", "The Insider", "Gladiator", "A Beautiful Mind", two Best Actor and two Best Picture wins, who are you to argue?) with another grand performance as the hard-working, right-hookin' fighter James J. Braddock, who at one time in the late 1920's looked to be one of the most promising young fighters to jump into the ring at Madison Square Garden.  With a few broken hands and a depression that through his entire family into a small, cold apartment in the city, Braddock lost the ability to earn the big fight and had to make a living outside of the boxing world.  While working at the docks with his pal (Paddy Considine) years after his last fight, Braddock learns from his long time trainer (in an Oscar-worthy performance from the snappy Paul Giamatti) that he has been given the opportunity by the head of the boxing commission (Bruce McGill) to have one more fight.  Braddock begins to win once again, not only shocking his colleagues and critics, but the entire boxing world.  The film eventually leads to the dramatic finale, in which Braddock is giving the chance of a lifetime-a heavy-weight fight against the great champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko), who has already killed several men inside of the ring.<br /><br />Just as all great sports films, "Cinderella Man" is only a sports film secondarily and a family drama at the forefront.  The true essence of Braddock (and Crowe with his superb performance) is outside of the ring, in which he spends time with his wife (Renee Zellweger) and children.  It is these tender moments and the trials and tribulations that Braddock endures for the ones he truly loves that shows not only the incredible horrors that people faced during the depression era, as well as the extraordinary love that Braddock and his wife Mae utilized to right the ship of life.  Director Ron Howard creates a supremely predictable film, but it is so well made and powerful that it does not even matter.  "Cinderella Man" is a true testament to hard-work, courage, and sincerity-ideals plausible for all.  A splendid two-and-a-half hour experience.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Leave your brain at the door"></head><body><p>Several years ago, a minor but entertaining science fiction movie called Pitch Black came out.  Essentially a well-made man vs. monster movie, this film was most noted for being a breakthrough movie for Vin Diesel.  In the Chronicles of Riddick, Diesel reprises his first big role with limited effect.<p>In Chronicles, Riddick must contend with the Necromongers, a superpowerful army that goes from planet to planet forcibly converting people to their cause.  They are in search of some mysterious place called the Underverse, which sounds cool, but never really plays a part in the movie.  The leader of the Necromongers - the Lord Marshal -  has heard a prophecy that he could be killed only by a certain race, which not so coincidentally Riddick is one of the last members of.  Before he can even attempt a killing, however, Riddick is detoured to a prison planet where he must rescue a girl who he met in the first movie.<p>Unlike Pitch Black, which was relatively simple in story and special effects, Chronicles is much grander in both story and look.  This is not necessarily a good thing, as there is too much going on to fit into a couple hours; instead of making the movie longer (or making additional movies), too much is crammed into a limited time.  In particularly, the prison planet sequence really doesn't need to be as long as it is since it really is a diversion from the main story.<p>There are other problems.  Although scientific law is often ignored in these sorts of movies, the science in this movie is often implausible:  characters can outrun sunrises and somehow, when it is 700 degrees in the sunlight, you can still survive if you're in the shade.  Internally, there are inconsistencies: for example, the Necromonger brainwashing process is sometimes absolutely effective and other times relatively easy to break out (it depends on what the story demands at any given point).  <p>Diesel does a good enough job in his role as the anti-heroic Riddick.  Judi Dench contributes little in her minor role, but isn't bad.  The remaining characters are also played competently if not spectacularly.  Despite its many problems, this is not an awful movie, and there is enough here to merit a weak three stars.  If you enjoyed Pitch Black, you might like this one as well, but it's best to turn off your brain before going into the theater.</p></body></html>

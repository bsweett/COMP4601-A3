<meta name="summary" content="I'm singing in the --- rain?"></head><body><p>This movie has a lot of depth. It also tries to do too much with itself. My wife couldn't stand it and thought it was a very long waste of her time. I'm not so sure.<p> Each character is interesting. Each one is written well. Each one with one exception has a mouth on him or her. We have a chronicle of dysfunctional characters doing wrong and dysfunctional things. About half way through the picture I had the oddest feeling that there was a happy ending waiting for me.<p> Since it is such a counter culture picture and the culture of the last 20 years celebrates all that is dysfunctional a counter culture picture can only be one of confidence and redemption and happy endings. We see that here.<p> I'm sure PETA had a fit at the end of this picture. I also think that it could have achieved its ends without the stunt. It had the virtue of being totally unexpected and so irrational that it shocks people to reality (Sept 11th).<p> Then again it could just be a cheep stunt for some guys who couldn't figure out how to get from a-b. Either way you'll find the performances all very good particularly by the supporting cast. (Three cheers for Henry Gibson who has more depth than anybody gives him credit) and if nothing else this movie will DEFINATELY give you something to talk about.</p></body></html>

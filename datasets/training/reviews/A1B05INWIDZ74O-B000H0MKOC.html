<meta name="summary" content="The King of Spin"></head><body><p>The Merchants of Death, the MOD Squad, meet weekly in a bar for mutual support and to share tales of weal and woe. The Mod Squad consists of three spin masters, one each for the tobacco, alcohol and gun industries. We fallow Nick Naylor played by Aaron Eckhart who is the Spin King of the Tobacco Industry. Nick is great at what he does, and that is talk, or shall we say spin. He does damage control and promotes the tobacco industries. No matter what is thrown at him and regardless of how bad the allegation, Nick is able to make tobacco come out looking like the good guy to his audience.<br /><br />Nick Naylor does not know the meaning of the word ethics, and won't let them get in the way of his arguments or our laughs. He weaves his way with twisted phrases and the ridiculous spin; you cannot help but laugh, even when you know you shouldn't. He does le his guard down and lets a reporter, played by Katie Holmes, get to close too him and shares too much information with her which she publishes. The only time you see that Nick may have a heart is when he sees that his 12-year old son is starting to follow in his foot steps and spins things to get his way, even his own mother.<br /><br />This film will have you laughing out loud and though you do not want to, you will be rooting for Nick Naylor. What this movie shows is that all large industries that have the probability of bad press will have spin masters. And we know politicians use them as well. So take a comedic look at how they work.</p></body></html>

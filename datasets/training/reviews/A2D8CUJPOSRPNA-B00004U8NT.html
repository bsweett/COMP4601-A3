Steven Spielberg wrote and directed this tremendous science fiction film with his own distinctive middle-class view on things.<p>Richard Dreyfuss is at his usual terrific best in the role of Ron Neary, another of Spielberg's &quot;Everyman&quot; characters.  He is an Indiana power lineman who is called out on a night where the entire city of Muncie goes dark.  Then, at a railroad crossing, he is suddenly shocked by the appearance of a UFO, flooding him with brilliant white light.  This encounter soon turns both him and his life upside down; his wife (Teri Garr) and kids can't understand his obsession with turning the shape of mashed potatoes or mounds of dirt from his backyard into a mysterious mountain he's been seeing in his mind.  Meanwhile, a lonely mother (Melinda Dillon) has her own close encounters with the UFOs, resulting in the still-unseen aliens abducting her son (Cary Guffey).  She too has visions of a mysterious mountain, visions which find their way into paintings and colorings.<p>When the news comes on TV with word that a train supposedly loaded with deadly nerve gases has overturned in northeastern Wyoming, however, both Dreyfuss and Dillon know the locale--Devils Tower.  In spite of government officials closing the park off to outsiders (the nerve gas leak is an elaborate cover story), Dreyfuss and Dillon witness, along with a noted UFO expert (Francois Truffaut, director of the 1969 classic THE WILD CHILD) and hundreds of others, the first actual close encounter of the third kind--direct physical contact between Earthlings and extra-terrestrials.<p>Spielberg's film was obviously a radical shift from most previous Hollywood depictions about outer space visitations to Earth.  He evokes the famous line &quot;Watch The Skies&quot; from Howard Hawks' 1951 classic THE THING, but does so without the paranoia and hysteria of the space invasion films of the 1950s.  There are no lasers or bug-eyed monsters.<p>Because CLOSE ENCOUNTERS was made after America's twin debacles with Vietnam and Watergate, it takes a low-key but rather apparent questionable view of the military and the government--as Stephen King put in his book &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;, a &quot;don't-let-the-military handle this&quot; approach.  In its scope and approach, this movie is closer, in a middle-class way, to Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, which Spielberg has always numbered among his favorites, than to any sci-fi film of the past.  Dreyfuss and Dillon are excellent in their roles, as is Truffaut; and as for John Williams' score...what more needs to be said; it's brilliant.  CLOSE ENCOUNTERS (also known as CE3K) won an Oscar for Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography, though four other men (William Fraker, Douglas Slocombe, John Alonzo, Laszlo Kovas) are also credited.<p>Well conceived, suspenseful, occasionally terrifying, and finally uplifting, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS is yet one more staggering masterpiece for a director with a whole lot of masterpieces still to come.</p></body></html>

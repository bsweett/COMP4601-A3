<meta name="summary" content="A great science fiction/ action movie. 4 and 1/2stars"></head><body><p>I usually like every Bruce Willis movie and once again, I liked this one. I have seen this movie many times and like it more every time. The movie takes place in a very well made futuristic earth where a cabbie ends up with a mysterious lady in his cab. And then, he finds himself needing to save the world from a very dark evil.<br /><br />The movie has a stellar cast with Bruce Willis, Mila Jokovich, Gary Oldman and Chris Tucker in a hilarious role.<br /><br />The movie has some very well made vilains that have some cool guns. The action scenes are great and Chris Tucker is actually hilarious as a very freaked out and feminine dude.<br /><br />The conclusion wasn't as good as it could have been but this movie ends up being UMBELIEVABLE (as Chris Tucker would say) with awesome special effects, memorable vilains, great acting, and awesome nonstop action.<br /><br />This is one that needs to be in everyone's collection.</p></body></html>

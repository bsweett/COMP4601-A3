<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Films of 2007"></head><body><p>"Ratatouille" is not just the best animated film directed by Brad Bird, whose previous efforts include "The Incredibles" and "The Iron Giant". It is a hilarous, heart-warming comedy about life, love and friendship which will leave both a warm glow in your heart and stomach long after you leave the movie theater. Pixar Studios has wrought in vivid animation, a wonderful valentine to Paris and to the art of fine cuisine, using state-of-the-art techniques that provide this exquisite animated film a grand sense of realism which I've found lacking in many of the recent cinematic summer blockbusters of 2007; if there is one film from this season that will be remembered as an enduring cinematic classic, then I strongly suspect that film will be "Ratatouille".<br /><br />"Ratatouille" is more than an intriguing Gallic twist on the time-worn tale of the country bumpkin who arrives in the big city, and unexpectedly, becomes someone recognized for his superb artistic craft. It's a hilarious look at friendship and personal relationships seen largely through the eyes of the French rat Remy (well-voiced by Patton Oswalt in a truly significant performance) who transforms both his excellent sense of smell and devotion to the culinary art of the late great French chef Gusteau (who also becomes quite literally, Remy's personal muse in brief appearances which resemble either Obi-Wan Kenobi's or Michael Behe's "Intelligent Designer"; I'm more inclined to think of Gusteau as a culinary version of Kenobi.), becoming the "Little Chef" of the befuddled young garbage boy Linguini (Lou Romano), the newest employee of Gusteau's once posh Parisian restaurant, now under the strict thumb of the meglomanic head chef Skinner (Ian Holm). A dazzling set of spectacular adventures await both Linguini and his rodent friend Remy, culminating in a final culinary showdown with Skinner and Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), Paris' legendary restaurant critic, set largely in some of the most authentic-looking depictions of a restaurant's kitchen that I have seen either in animation or live action. With "Ratatouille" director Brad Bird and his crew have crafted an animated film which continues the Disney tradition of great animation, and a state-of-the-art example of animated cinema which will be recognized for years as one of the artistic landmarks of this genre.</p></body></html>

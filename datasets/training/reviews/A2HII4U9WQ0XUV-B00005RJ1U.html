Go on a road trip: look at all those lonely diners marooned along vast, forsaken strips of blacktop. Take one of those empty little roads to nowhere, three turns away from the Interstate: go bumpity-bump down a dusty trail to a gas-n'-go that closes shop on Sunday because---well, there's just no business in these parts on Sunday, Old Hoss.<br /><br />Flip the radio on right about now: chances are you're going to get a load of Jesus. Come to the Lord! Hell awaits! Satan stalking the Earth, hungry as a lion, seeking those who He can devour, Hallelujah!<br /><br />Thousands of Americans disappear every year, in our great interconnected Republic: it's true, many run away, change their names, disappear, start new lives.<br /><br />But it's also true, I think, that many of them set out on road trips, and get eaten alive.<br /><br />So you're Darius and Trish, and you have the worst timing ever. Because, see, on this particular stretch of blacktop, you've got this Thing. A Troll, let's say: an Ogre, the Boogeyman, a Monster. Every twenty-three years it awakens: for 23 days, it gets to Eat. And by Jesus, it sure is hungry!<br /><br />Timing is everything.<br /><br />Now: director Victor Salva is a real sicky: I'm going to avoid into the man's history of pedophilia---though I do think his peculiar obsessions very much inform his deeply personal vision of horror, and---at least from a cinematic standpoint---in a good way. The Creeper doesn't just stalk Darius---he has a lark sniffing his undies!<br /><br />But look: the true ghoulish glory of "Jeepers Creepers" lies in its simplicity: you're on the road, you're tired, you're hungry, you want to sleep. Without meaning to, you see a dark, hulking figure---all inky shadows in its duster and broad-brimmed hat---dumping what appear to be bodies down a corrugated pipe, into God knows where.<br /><br />It sees you.<br /><br />And oh God, though you wish it weren't so---though you later wish desperately you hadn't seen *it*---it comes hunting for you.<br /><br />It's outside your window right now. Looking in.<br /><br />That's the guts and bloody viscera of "Jeepers Creepers"---forget the goofy psychic lady, forget the gratuitous Eileen Brennan---and focus down on the dark, stark, deeply twisted sickness of this flick about the Boogeyman hot on your trail, looking you up, coming calling to your bedside to give you one of those great parting gifts and---oh yes---a long, sweet kiss in the Dark.<br /><br />Pucker up.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

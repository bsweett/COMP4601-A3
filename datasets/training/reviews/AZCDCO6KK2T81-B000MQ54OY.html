<meta name="summary" content="Happy Time with "Happy Feet""></head><body><p>IN SHORT:<br /><br />The animation is truly groundbreaking, the voices are perfectly cast, the soundtrack is a delightful, and although the direction is a bit lost in the pacing department, it is competent.  I thoroughly enjoyed this simplistic story about acceptance, respect, and standing up for one's self.  I am not overly concerned with some of the political, environmental and religious overtones that some have made a big deal over here.  The larger storyline and themes that I already mentioned are honest and straight-forward enough; I just don't see all the so-called "evil propaganda" imbedded in the story about abandoning faith, hating seals, and to stop all fishing.  I think that is just reading too much into things and I don't see any of these as the essential messages of the film. I really can't understand why anyone would fault a family movie that promotes being a bit more environmentally aware and to be more accepting of those that are different.  Sit back and relax and just enjoy the film!  It is an exceptional one.<br /><br />IN LONG (and I hope worth your reading):<br /><br />I always try to avoid confrontation on political, environmental, and religious viewpoints as they tend to be very personal.  We often respond with a knee-jerk reaction to every criticism in these areas because they are so personal and, thus, produce a less than positive outcome by the end (if there ever is one) on any one topic in these arenas.  We rarely "win" anyone to "our side" and often alienate the very individuals we set out to win to our side (whatever "our side" may be).  It is within these very corridors of hate, suspicion, and intolerant extremism that some reviewers here are walking as apparent in not only their reviews, but also in their vicious comments to all that question their specific view of things.  I kind of enjoy the irony that that is one of the very themes within this film and endlessly argued about here.<br /><br />It matters little whether I agree or disagree with others here on the so-called "hidden agenda" or not-so-subtle themes presented in the film.  I always try to have a dignified discussion whenever I can, but this whole online thing seems to allow many to behave like the schoolyard bully we remember from our youth.  They seem to think that it's okay to be ruthless online as they can hide in the safety of cyberspace.  Many of these reviews and discussions, on both sides of the issues, have gotten way out of line and personal and they didn't need to be.<br /><br />I for one found this to be a simple movie and PG or not, it is designed for kids.  There aren't too many adults who would venture out to this without their kids to see it and simply because a film is rated PG does not mean it isn't intended mostly for kids.  I'm not sure where some here got the notion that PG is adults ONLY as I've seen debated here.  PG is simply Parental Guidance is SUGGESTED and usually followed with reasons why.  That's it.  Even some PG-13 films are designed for the whole family although one has to be careful with those films.  In any event,  the themes in "Happy Feet" are simple enough without diving headlong into an endless debate on the film's intentions and rating.  My children, 10 and 14, didn't leave the theatre thinking "Oh my gosh, Dad, they were condemning our faith" or "seals are terrible creatures picking on cute funny penguins" and nor did they respond with "now let's stop all that fishing, Dad.  It's evil" or "Let's dethrone the Pope."  Even if the intentions of the film makers where such, then they failed miserably as I haven't met anyone, child or adult, who has read so much into a simple animated film as those here.  I personally think that is a bit hypersensitive, but like I said earlier, we all can be on issues related to politics, faith, and the environment.<br /><br />Please keep in mind that I'm denying that certain themes aren't prevelent in the film; I simply think that they are good ones for the most part, and for the perhaps negative ones, I'm just not that sensitive to be upset about.  I'm confident many will think differently and label me a liberal moron (even though I'm a conservative Christian by most), and others will label me a lukewarm Christian for not being upset about the perceived anti-Catholic/Christian messages in the film.  I guess I am a moderate or I just don't get all hyped up over a kids movie that has, what I personally believe to be, predominantly good messages in it.<br /><br />For the record, yes, I saw the themes in the film about abusing nature and overfishing.  I think one is hard-pressed to not noticed what we've done to our environment.  I do find it sad that some here hoot and holler "where's the evidence?" and equally complaining about such a message in a kids' film.  The fact that we can literally count the number of blue whales left should be an indication of how far we've gone.  The fact that those on the space shuttle can literally notice the level of deforestation from one flight to another should be another indicator of our abuse of nature.  I offer these off-handed pieces of evidence with the full knowledge that those who think differently will quickly dismiss them or insist on more facts and stats until it weighs a ton above their heads which appear to be buried in the sand.  In any event, I don't see what all the fuss is over a kid's film containing some messages about caring for the planet better than their adult counterparts do or did.<br /><br />Yes, again, I noticed the theme of questioning what we may have always believed and I truly understand how this theme could unsettle some; however, I also saw, to greater extent, accepting those who are different and can not or will not conform to society's norms (whatever they may be).  I really don't see this as condeming Catholics or Christians as some here have been screaming.  Someone once told me that with doubt comes faith.  We shouldn't blindly accept anything, but rather discover what is truth to us individually.  Afterall, isn't faith believing in things not seen but hoped for?  That is going to be different things to different people.  I have never been concerned about our children questioning our faith, and, in fact, I encourage it.  I don't want my faith to be theirs simply on my say so.  Faith is such a personal thing and forcing something on someone never really resolves much and breeds contempt in the end anyhow.<br /><br />In that vein I also noted the theme in the film of ignorance in attempting to destroy whatever is different from what we normally accept and, sadly, I've seen that in the reviews and comments on this film.  Why must we always demonize the individual who thinks differently?  How ironic that that is exactly the focus of this film.</p></body></html>

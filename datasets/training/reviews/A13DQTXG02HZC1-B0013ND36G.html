<meta name="summary" content="A Well-Deserved Finale"></head><body><p>This movie has a finality about it and coinciding with Arnold been selected to become the Governor of California definitely puts the nails in the coffin once and for all.  Here, The Director manages to convey to the audience about the inevitable, that is irrespective of how much young John O'Connor tried to avoid Judgement Day, he can't change his destiny.  Here, we are introduced to his future wife, in the form of feisty Claire Dane from &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; fame.  These days, it seemed like all action movies tried to outdo one another in car chase scenes as we have witnessed in Matrix Reloaded, Bad Boys 2, 2Fast 2 Furious, and what we have here is just as good, if not better than the one in Judgement Day.  A lot of my mates told me that Judgement Day is simply a more superior offering.  I concurred to certain extent.  Perhaps, this movie lacked of James Cameron's clinical direction of the movie but Jonathan Mostow opted not to go head to head with James' style.  Rather, he went for the joyride, pop-corn style with lots of actions and memorable but hillarious one-liners.  I disagree with some critics who said that this is simply a repetition of Judgement Day with the nemesis replaced by a female version.  On the contrary, I see this movie completely from a different light.  Rather, it's simply an entertaining movie that promised to deliver &amp; it delivered well.  Definitely enjoyable to watch &amp; a movie that I wouldn't hesitate recommend to other viewers!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Funny movie that just runs out of gas."></head><body><p>I thought this movie was pretty damn funny. It had a really good cast. Any time you put Favreau and Vaughn together it is gold. They don't share a lot of on screen time but the collaberation between the two is always dynamite and funny as hell. Cole Hauser proves again that he is limited and a good bit player but he is not bad. Vincent D'Nofrio (sp?) is just excellent as Vaughn other brother. Jennifer Anniston is ok and is good for this type of role which is playing Jennifer Anniston or basically the same role she played on Friends and every other thing she has been in. For the life of me I love when they hype a nude scene and how risque it is and then you come to find that the scene was shot so that it could have been Rosey O'donnel walking across the floor. You see, you could see Jenn's head and her making her coy little Rachel faces as she is suppose to be so shocking but they literally make the picture so blurry it could have been a Sasquatch walking across the floor and you wouldn't have known.<br /><br />Now for my knock on the movie and why I only gave it a 2. It just fell apart in the end. It became a hugely overly dramatic... melodramatic semi tear jerker and downer in the end. I saw the same thing in Art School Confiential and the same thing in Adam Sandlers Click. They take a semi funny movie (The Break Up was much funnier than the two I just mentioned because of Vaughn and Favreau) and then they ditch the whole side splitting funny stuff for the whole "getting serious now" or "emotional message" thing at the end that just killed it. I mean KILLED IT. Who wants to go see a comedy and laugh 70% of the time to walk out sad or p.o.'d? Not me.</p></body></html>

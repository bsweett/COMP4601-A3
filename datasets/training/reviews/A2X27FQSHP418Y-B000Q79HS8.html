This movie is a swindle from beginning to end. Why? Let me explain.<br /><br />We had a previously decent, intriguing, sometimes exciting spy action thriller with THe Bourne Identity. What do we hav in this sequence? Let me answer:<br /><br />1) ZERO suspense. You can miles ahead who is (are) the bad guys. Absolutely nothing like the first movie.<br /><br />2) How can a director, ON PURPOSE, decide to shoot a film in such an obnoxious way, using a hand camera all along the way, and ordering his cameramen to shake it, shake it,  and shake it once more, and then goes into the editor's room and orders the editor to cut from frame to frame in less than a second, along THE WHOLE MOVIE. It's not only in the action scenes. It's in the WHOLE MOVIE! It's something to wonder when a director shows such contempt for his audience, not showing ONE SINGLE fight sequence in a way that we could follow! And, even doing so, he receives a lot of reviews like "Oh, except for that shaky camera work, the movie is very good..." How can a movie be good, no matter the quality of its plot, if we CAN'T WATCH IT??<br /><br />The same way that Greengrass showed contempt for me (as a member of the audience paying nine bucks for watching this mess), I show contempt for him, and I do not intend to watch any more movies directed by him. I'd also like to know if Damon has been bitten by the famous "Affleck's Virus", and began to choose his roles only for the paycheck, because I refuse to believe that he got satisfied with the final editing result of this mess.<br /><br />THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is a mess of a movei, COMPLETELY ruined by the director's choices. It's a shame that no one above him put a halt to it. Anyway, the movie is making money, so they must be proud of making audiences sick while watching it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining"></head><body><p>The movie is one of the better comedys from the past year (along with Harold and Kumar go to White Castle).  This movie has its bright moments and some of the film reminded me of Eddie Murphy's Nutty Professor and Boomerang.  Will Smith is entertaining as the date doctor who secretly helps a lot of guys win girls that they would never have a chance with otherwise.  His big assignment is to help a basically nice though "bumbling" guy win the heart of a Paris Hilton type heiress.  Many of the training scenes were in the trailer but are still extremely entertaining seeing them again in the film.<br /><br />My one big problem with the film and the reason it didn't rate 5 stars is that I saw a lack of real chemistry between Smith and Eva Mendez (the gossip columnist who is looking for the elusive date doctor and wants to expose him because her friend was hurt by one of his clients).  Granted the exchange between the two during their first meeting in a bar is excellent.  From there on it seems like there is nothing there especially during the times when Mendez acts really weird in front of Smith.</p></body></html>

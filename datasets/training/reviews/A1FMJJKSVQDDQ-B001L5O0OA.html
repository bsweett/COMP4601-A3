<meta name="summary" content="Always funny, always touching, and NEVER overrated!"></head><body><p>There must be at least a hundred films and TV specials that deal with Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, etc. All of them range from the greatest to the worst, and A Christmas Story is one of the greatest. A majority of this country's population have seen this film, and I'm sure all of them now love it right after they've watched it (well, ALMOST all of them, now that I've seen the current reviews here on Amazon). I should be included on the list of those who love it. I mean, this is a definite classic. It's both hilarious and touching at the same time. Along with It's a Wonderful Life and Home Alone, every single minute of this film is almost flawless. It's also one of those films in which you can memorize much of the dialogue, not to mention the many sight gags (tongue on frozen pole, anyone?). I think my favorite scenes are the ones involving soap and lamps . . . I won't give out any spoilers for those who haven't seen it yet. Speaking of which, if you haven't seen this Christmas classic just yet, give it a shot, especially on Christmas Eve. You'll quickly understand why it's considered one of the greatest Christmas films of all time.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Go, Tracy!"></head><body><p>Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) is a bubbly, bouncy, chubby girl who's a great dancer.  Her dream is to be a regular on the Corny Collins dance party show, like her secret crush Link (Zac Efron) and the most popular girl at school, Amber.  Amber's mother (Michelle Pfeiffer) is station manager, however, and she not only rejects Tracy because of her weight, she bans black dancers from the show except for one day a month.  With the help of her friends and parents (John Travolta, Christopher Walken),  Tracy not only becomes a dancing star on the show, she opens it up to all races.<br /><br />This is one feel-good movie, with energetic song and dance numbers every few minutes that will absolutely have you smiling and tapping your toes.  I soon forgot about Travolta playing Tracy's mother and just enjoyed the performance, which is very good.  Nikki Blonsky is adorable and does a spectacular job in her first movie; Pfeiffer is convincing in the unsympathetic role of a bigot.  Christopher Walken is a joy to watch as always, totally charismatic and loveable as the eccentric dad.  This movie is a lot like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006B1HH">Grease</a> but much more wholesome and positive.  It's a happy, family film with lots of catchy tunes and talented actors.</p></body></html>

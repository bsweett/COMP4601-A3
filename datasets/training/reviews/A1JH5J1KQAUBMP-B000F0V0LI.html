After a lifetime of hard work, aging cattleman Wil Anderson (in a great performance by John Wayne) must go on one more cattle drive, this time accompanied by schoolboys since all of his experienced hands have taken off to search for gold.  Not only must he get the cattle to their destination safely, but he must also teach the boys how to be men.  Great supporting performances and a surprising turn in the plot toward the end.</p></body></html>

This is a good film to watch with your girlfriend or wife since it seems to appeal to both genders.  The story follows the return of a failing actor from LA back to New Jersey to go to the funeral of his mother who he hasn't seen in 7 years.  Along the way he has to face a number of problems from his screwed up childhood to facing his father.  A bunch of off beat friends and a well played crazy girlfriend(Portman) help him out.  This is one to see.</p></body></html>

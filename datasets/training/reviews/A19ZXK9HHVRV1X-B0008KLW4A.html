<meta name="summary" content="unpretentious comic book film"></head><body><p>I admire the approach the filmmakers have taken towards "Catwoman,"  for rather than setting their tale in the same dark, cavernous, largely computer-generated metropolis we are used to in most of these superhero movies, they have chosen to keep it rooted more in the real world.  In a similar way, they manage to keep Catwoman herself believable, vulnerable and realistic, thanks in no small part to the beautiful and beguiling Halle Berry in the title role.<br /><br />Berry plays Patience Phillips, a pretty, but less-than-glamorous advertising artist who works for a major cosmetics company, ruled over by a tyrannical CEO and his equally ruthless wife, the former spokes model for their products.  When Patience mistakenly overhears the corporate bigwigs discussing the fact that one of their best-selling creams is causing women to become seriously ill, she is dutifully murdered by a couple of the boss' henchmen.  However, all is not lost for Patience, for, unbeknownst to her, she has been chosen to receive the special gift of reincarnation in the form of a cat woman who will no longer be subject to the laws of either nature or society.<br /><br />The best parts of "Catwoman" involve Patience's incrementally becoming more and more catlike in her attitude and demeanor, and her slowly dawning realization of what is happening to her.  It takes awhile for her to accept this surprising turn of events, but, when she does, she becomes, quite literally, a new woman, bold, self-confident and willing to take on the oppressors and evildoers in our society.  Patience is paired up with an attractive police officer (apparently the only one ever on duty in that city), who gradually comes to realize who and what she is as well.  Berry and Benjamin Bratt make a very appealing romantic couple, and their scenes together are some of the best in the movie.  Also impressive is Sharon Stone who deserves credit for allowing herself to appear in a role in which her "fading" beauty plays such a significant part (shades of Vivien Leigh playing Blanche DuBois in "A Streetcar Named Desire").  Stone is the villainous wife of the company's CEO who is determined to make sure Catwoman doesn't spill the beans on their defective product.<br /><br />The special effects are probably the least successful aspect of this film.  Catwoman's jumping from rooftop to rooftop looks an awful lot like CGI effects to me.  And the movie does occasionally go on auto pilot (especially towards the end), though, thankfully, not usually for very long.  The literal cat fight between Berry and Stone at the finale is necessary, I guess, but really rather silly overall.<br /><br />Still, considering the pounding this movie received from both critics and audiences when it was first released in the summer of 2004, I wound up being pleasantly surprised at just how enjoyable "Catwoman" turned out to be.</p></body></html>

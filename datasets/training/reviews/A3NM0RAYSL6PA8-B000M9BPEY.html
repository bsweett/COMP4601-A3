<meta name="summary" content="Lovely tear-jerker--with a mild bit of wisdom, too."></head><body><p>There's a dreamlike quality to Big Fish, a kind of luminous, otherworldly tone that befits a story that skips from the incredible to the mundane like a flickering candle. In the end, it is a surreal, touching story--a darn good tear puller--that left me feeling a bit happier, and even a bit wiser.  Nicely done.<p>I must admit that I'd held off seeing this movie because I'd lost hope for Tim Burton.  His downright awful remake of one of my favorite films, Planet of the Apes, had turned me cynical and suspicious.  Was he, as it appeared, just a poseur--with dirty mop of unkempt hair and fat-framed glasses fancied by eighty-year-olds?  Had his successes been a scam perpetrated by a guy who'd fooled a lot of dim-brained Hollywood numbskulls?  Big Fish, if it truly is Burton's child (after the Apes fiasco, I must admit that I've not entirely disabused myself of the idea that Burton just put his name on this--but I digress), redeems him.  It isn't soaringly great, but it is truly well-done and enjoyable.<p>There are a few minor problems which I should point out.  Billy Crudup, who plays a son in search of his real father, is a very weak actor, and whether it's him or the role he plays, or both, he comes across as just plain unlikeable.  It's really too bad, since his role could have provided for an added bit of depth and resonance to the film.  Thankfully, his screen time is very limited--perhaps Burton, himself, judged that Crudup was too weak to merit a central place on the screen.  But for all of Crudup's weakness, Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor give outstanding performances.  McGregor, who plays Crudup's father character as young man, shines with likeability and energy, the kind of person you meet rarely in life and who pulls you in with his joy and indefagitable innocence.  Finney is splended as a sputtering, kind-hearted yarn-spinner.  Jessica Lange is fine in her small role, and the young actress who plays her character as a young woman (Alison Lohman) is almost too beautiful to be believed--which adds, of course, to the ghostly, dreamlike quality of the film.<p>I really liked this film, clumsy fish metaphor aside!  It's gentle and provocative entertainment that is well worth seeing with the whole family.</p></body></html>

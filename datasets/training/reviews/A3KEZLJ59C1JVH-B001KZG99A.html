Stark manages to invent a bionic suit made of iron and escape from his captors, although the experience leads to a shift in his business strategy and an ultimate showdown with his longtime business partner (Jeff Bridges).<br /><br />I knew nothing about the Iron Man character before seeing this movie, and I wasn't prepared to like this film as much as I did. It's a very character-driven movie, which sets it apart from your average run-of-the-mill action flicks. Downey is charming and absolutely perfectly cast in this role, and he has amazing chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow, who portrays Stark's assistance/platonic love interest, Pepper. "Iron Man" is a hilarious, exciting movie that will definitely make me buy a ticket to see the sequel when it arrives in theatres two weeks from today.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable Pseudo-Horror Flick - Recommended!"></head><body><p>"I Am Legend" is a very enjoyable post apocalyptic "zombie" movie that only bears a mild resemblance to the Matheson original story, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765318741">I Am Legend</a>. Will Smith puts in a good performance in the lead as Dr. Robert Neville, who is perhaps the last "normal" human on earth after a highly contagious virus sweeps the US and possibly the world. Being the last man on earth and perhaps the only person who could find a cure for the many infected humans (aka fast zombies) is a huge burden for the good doctor, who has settled into a bit of routine of trying to gather supplies, capture test subjects, and practicing his golf long game.<br /><br />A lot of the story is told through flashback and there are truly some moving scenes that add to the drama and provide insight to the deteriorating mindset of Dr. Neville. The action is fairly evenly paced, with some heart pounding moments scattered throughout. The special effects range from cheesy to very good, but hold up when needed.<br /><br />This movie does a great job of setting the mood of the isolation and fear that Dr. Neville experiences and is a quite watchable horror flick... I just think it could have been named something else and would have been just as good.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></body></html>

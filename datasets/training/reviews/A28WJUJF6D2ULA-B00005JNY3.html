<meta name="summary" content="Southern Gothic With The Supernatural Thrown In"></head><body><p>Atmospheric on-screen southern Gothic sums up this film, as a health care worker, Caroline, played here by America's would-be sweetheart Kate Hudson, relocates from a corporate-managed, assembly line style New Orleans hospice, to a private position in a run-down old mansion in the country. She meets her suspicious, barely cordial employer, the aged Violet (Gena Rowlands)  and is shown the apparently delusional old man (John Hurt),  recent victim of a stroke, for whom she is to care.  There is also a charming but somehow peculiarly ever-present local lawyer who sympathizes with Caroline's unease at this assignment, while at the same time acting as a liaison between her and the subtly superstition Violet. Violet allows Caroline into her home and employ, but imposes some strange rules of conduct on her, foremost among these is that there are to be no mirrors in the house. Caroline undertakes her duties to the best of her ability, while at the same time she finds herself morbidly curious about the history of the gloomy old domicile, scene of past tragedy. Forbidden by Violet to enter the upstairs attic space, Caroline cannot resist doing just that after she comes into possession of an all-purpose skeleton key. And that, as they say, sets off a spooky chain reaction that takes us through the elements of hoodoo, kidnapping, and murder that unwind through the concluding half of the film. There is a twist ending, not on a par with The Sixth Sense or The Others, but a pretty good one, nonetheless, that I'll not give away here, only say that you might guess it before its revelation but if you do, that doesn't spoil the full implication of what exactly has long been going on inside that creepy old house in the bayous.</p></body></html>

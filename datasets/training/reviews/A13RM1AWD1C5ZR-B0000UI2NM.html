<meta name="summary" content="Underworld- Just Cool"></head><body><p>Underworld, an action flick starring Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman can be called diverting entertainment.  Though the plot of the film is rather incomprehensible, the film has enough style to be atleast watchable.  Director Len Wisemen who is recently engaged to Beckinsale) creates a nice setting to the film, with the appropriate tone.  The action scenes are pretty good, as well the visual effects which are passingly cool including the transformation of humans into werevolves.<br />  Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, a vampire.  The film takes place in London.  There are mainly two striving groups, the vampires and the lycans a.k.a. werewolves.  Scott Speedman plays a human who has been bitten and has transformed into a lycan.  Unfortunately Beckinsale and Speedman fall in love, which is intolerable since they are sworn enemies.<br />  Underworld is mild for the genre, since it isn't overly graphic, though there still is an abundant amount of violence.  Mainly including much gunplay, impalements, bitings (some of which are bloody), whippings and fights among vampries/lycans.  There isn't much profanity, just a few instances of the "f" and "s" word.  Underworld is rated R for Strong Violence/Gore and Some Language.  As for the acting, well it wasn't totally believe or convincing but then again you don't expect oscar-worthy acting in a film like this.  I saw it in theatres, sadly not during opening weekend.  This film is worth viewing in theatures, and possibly owning on Video or DVD.</p></body></html>

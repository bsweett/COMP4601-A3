For me when I watch this film it's actually a little more on the disturbing side than funny because it's really not so far fetched,both back when it was made and in the present time. Dr.Strangelove is presented in black & white but is wildly colorful in it's witty content. This is truly a must have for Kubrick fans and anyone who has half a brain and a sense of humor. In these dark & scary times we are living in today where the apocolypse seems to be poking it's inevitable head around each corner this film seems to be both relevent & appropriate.</p></body></html>

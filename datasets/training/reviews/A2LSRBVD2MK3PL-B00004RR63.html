<meta name="summary" content="After 16 Years Still A Great Movie"></head><body><p>It has ben nerly 16 years since &quot;The Terminator&quot; came out, and it is still a great movie. Some movies lose their shine after a few years but &quot;The Terminator&quot; has not. This was the role Arnold  Schwarzenegger was born to play, nobody could have been better. Though I do  love this movie, the DVD has no extras besides a theatrical trailer and the  transfer is only moderatly good. But you can't go wrong with this movie.</p></body></html>

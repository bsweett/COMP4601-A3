What I lkied about it was the fact that it did something different. It toyed with people who were forced to forget something for whatever reason. But, through strength and hope, one woman still remembers her old life that got taken away from her. But, the thing that didn't work for me is the fact that there were a lot of questions in this and only a fraction of them were answered. But, Hey, I dunno, Maybe that's closer to real life.<br /><br />Rent it, don't buy it.</p></body></html>

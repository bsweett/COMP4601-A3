<meta name="summary" content="HOSTILE"></head><body><p>Wow... I didn't expect "Hostel" to be so vicious. I can't recall any American director making such violent and brutal movies as this one.<br /><br />Three friends who travel in Europe looking for some good time (sex, drugs & rock'n'roll), finally find themselves in a little Slovakian town, in a hostel where everything seems to fit their idea of heaven on Earth. And as it's easy to imagine, soon this heaven turns into hell or even worse.<br /><br />And so "Hostel" starting as an average teenage sex-comedy, closer to its second half turns into a bloody mess. But not that stupid teen slasher bloody mess - I mean real sick and horrid bloody mess.<br /><br />Directors used to fight for appropriate ratings for their films lately, hence we don't get to see pictures that are SO gory very often. Eli Roth obviously doesn't care about ratings, so "Hostel" turned out to be everything a true horror fan can only dream of. His film is full of gore, severed limbs, sweat and vomit. Believe me, for a long time we haven't seen such a brutal, twisted and in-your-face picture as Eli Roth's "Hostel". But it's far from being perfect though. It's extremely disturbing and nauseous, as a horror fan I liked it a lot, but there's still something missing. Some characters' development maybe, some sense... It seemed that trying to shock the audience, the makers of the film forgot why they'd decided to make it in the first place. But it's just the second big movie of Roth, he's young and very talented, I'm sure he'll give the fans hell in the nearest future.<br /><br />Interesting observation - I just watched "Hostel" in theater, and after the film people were lowering their eyes as if they were ashamed they were watching it. That's what I call a good horror movie!</p></body></html>

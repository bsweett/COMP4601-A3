<meta name="summary" content="Dramatic historical adventure"></head><body><p>This is truly a masterful and commanding sea adventure in the style of the great old Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone movies from the 30s and 40s such as Captain Blood, or The Sea Wolf, with E.G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart. For those who are fans of "The Mountains of the Moon" with Patrick Bergen (although a land adventure in Africa) you'll know what I mean when I say that if you've been wanting a similar historical adventure in faraway places then this movie might be just what you're looking for. I really enjoyed "The Mountains of the Moon" and have always wished for more.<br /><br />I understand that the movie takes liberties with the original timeline and combines two O'Brian books, which has offended some fans, but as an adventure movie it comes off very well. Using a combination of CGI, big and small ship's models, historical footage, and on site filming, the movie's look and feel is as authentic as you could want.<br /><br />Add to that several dramatic sea battles and hand to hand (or more like sword to sword) deck engagements, and you have a rousing maritime adventure as good as anything from the old days of action and adventure flicks. The brief sojourn to the Galapagos Islands adds another dimension to this well done film. Fine acting by the whole cast and a more than competent script round out the film's many strengths. Overall, a great adventure film from the capable hands of Peter Weir and well worth your time.</p></body></html>

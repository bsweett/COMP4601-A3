I rented this film with the only expectation being that it will probably be something along the lines of an "X Files" episode with Julianne Moore in the title role.  Just from the packaging I was reminded of another film, "The Mothman Prophecies," that eerily has more than a few things in common with "The Forgotten."  By the end of the film I was also comparing it to another film called "Dark City."  I liked both of those films, and the "X Files," so it is really no surprise that I went along for the ride on this one as well.  There is a mystery to be solved with potential for altering perceptions about our place in the world, or perhaps it is just a showcase for how exquisitely bizarre the workings of the human mind really are.  I enjoyed this mystery tour enough to follow along and be eventually rewarded for my participation.  What sets this film apart from the rest in its genre is that there are some real people at the center of the story, ones that are easy to relate to and worth caring about.  Julianne Moore carries the film on her small shoulders with great depth of character and obviously affecting the performances of all that come into contact with her immense talent.  On the DVD there is a second, alternate ending that is clearly not the better choice; but there is one of the deleted scenes that should have been included in the final cut because I was wondering by film's end what happened to that particular character, and it would have tied up that loose end neatly.  The theatrical release ending is more ominous while the alternate is much lighter and less provocative.  There are some slow, even bewildering moments, but the payoff in the end is worth the journey.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

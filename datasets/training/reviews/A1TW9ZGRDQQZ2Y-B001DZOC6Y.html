<meta name="summary" content="Cool concept, but poor execution"></head><body><p>First off, I am not a M. Night Shyamalan hater. I really loved The Sixth Sense and I enjoyed Unbreakable and Signs. The Village was average at best and Lady in the Water was pretty awful. The Happening couldn't be his third bad movie in a row, right? I'm sorry to say that this is one of worst movies I have seen this year and I've see a lot. The concept is neat and there are some creepy elements early on, but it just gets worse as it goes along. The acting is very bad from almost everyone involved and the dialogue makes things even worse. I just don't know what is going on with this once promising director. I'm glad I listened to the critic's reviews and waited for this one to hit DVD.<br /><br />The Blu-ray does offer good picture and sound quality. The extras are just standard stuff and nothing that interesting.</p></body></html>

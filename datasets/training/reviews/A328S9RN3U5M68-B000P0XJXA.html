Instead of focusing on powerful explosions and screaming background 'music' and visual tricks, David Mamet, who wrote and directed this tense expose' of the government and its brutal intelligence tactics, opts for terse dialogue and rapid sequence encounters to lead the viewer down a very twisted, convoluted, but fascinating path.  Val Kilmer is superb as Scott, the ex-military, seemingly amoral Secret Service agent (funny how we use "SS" letters in our own way...) assigned the complex job of finding the President's daughter (Kristen Bell).  He is assisted by new recruit Curtis (Derek Luke of 'Antoine Fisher' and 'Pieces of April' fame, finding himself very at ease in this type of role!). The endlessly surprising but highly orchestrated search uncovers rings of white slavery in Dubai and other Arab cities, prostitution rings, pockets of quasi-terrorist gents - the list goes on.  The filming technique is one closely associated with Mamet: scenes are shot from obtuse angles and collaged together to heighten tension (if confusing the viewer a bit too often).  Yes, the plot is frequently confusing and at times requires backup and rewind to unravel some of the important dialogue, but the end result is one of intense intrigue  and if you don't mind feeling a bit lost at times, the journey is eventually worth it.  Definitely not for the viewer who needs strictly linear scripting!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="About as good as the Swedish version"></head><body><p>Let Me In is a surprisingly well made remake of the Swedish film "Let the Right One In". Mostly because the direction, locations, camera shots and the atmosphere all feel about the same. The movie is good because the Swedish film was and because this is pretty much the same movie. Yet, I never felt bored watching it and was about as entertained by it as I was by the Swedish version.</p></body></html>

(Check out his resume).  Patrick Marber wrote the original stage play and it almost makes me want to seek it out in its truest form, as this film brought out nothing in me other than cynicism and dismay.  In fact, the main emotional themes seem to be neurotic passion, heartbreak, sadness, anger, evil vengeance, pathetic pleading, deception, and honesty to the point of brutality.  Some may find this an interesting exploration of emotions mixed with complex personalities in confusing circumstances.  Some call this entertainment, but I think all involved could have done much better.  This is a very personal film and one that can only be interpreted by the viewer.  I found it very, very bleak.</p></body></html>

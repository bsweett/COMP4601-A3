I took another look at this film after watching Tarantino's recent tour de force &quot;Kill Bill&quot;. Must has been said about Pulp Fiction, from being a violent bloodfest to a spiritual journey; but one thing is certainly true: Pulp Fiction is a cinematic classic.<p>Pulp Fiction is really three films wrapped in one: the story of two hitmen sent out on a job to retrieve a briefcase, a boxer asked to throw a fight, and an actress with a habit that nearly kills her. These stories are intertwined effectively and effortlessly, the seems between them are negligible, so when one character from another story suddenly pops up in another one, its understandable. <p>It took Tarantino's vision to pull this off. Clearly, he's at the forefront of this movie, from its look and style. First, the sharp script, dialogue heavy, is extremely well written. When the Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield dish about Amsterdam McDonald's burgers, you realize you are listening to golden words. This isn't your average violent flick.<p>What also sets Pulp Fiction apart from your average violent flick is that much of the direct violence is never seen, or handled offscreen. Give Tarantino credit for making us think it's a bloodfest, but in reality, other films that have violent scenes that run for ten minutes, compared to Fictions quick scenes, you see the difference. Tarantino manages to build suspense and tension, in order for us to think it's more violent than it is.<p>In addition to that scene, the other classic scene occurs between Vincent Vega and Uma's slinky Mia Wallace at Jack Rabbit Slim's. I was totally entranced by the absolute perfection that scene has. From the stylistic 50's diner atmosphere, to the oddly weird and normal twist contest Mia and Vincent enter, it's brilliant from start to finish. <p>Pulp Fiction is a cinematic feast from beginning to end. Thanks to Quention for preparing it for us, and may we gorge for many years to come.</p></body></html>

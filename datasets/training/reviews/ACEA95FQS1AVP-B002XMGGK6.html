Law Abiding Citizen goes way beyond action, though it does have some explosive sequences.  It's actually more of a noir thriller, with many plot twists and unexpected diversions.  It had many elements that reminded me of films like Phone Booth, Die Hard With a Vengeance and even Speed.  The trailer made it out as a simple criminal versus a virtuous DA, but it's much deeper than that.  Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler are playing a deadly game against one another, and there is no black and white.  Butler's character is supposedly "the villain," but one that is so easy to sympathize with, even justified in his actions. The film really highlights many of the problems in our criminal justice system, lending the story credibility and realism.  The plot kept me guessing as to just how Butler was accomplishing his objectives.  However, I do think the ending could have been better.  After so much clever cat and mouse, the climax was too simple and didn't live up to what came before.  Overall though, it was an exciting film that kept me paying close attention and on the edge of my seat.  Also, the acting from the two leads was top notch, and even the supporting cast was noticeably superb.<br /><br />The DVD has some well done extras, including featurettes on special effects shots and behind the scenes.  However, the best featurette discusses the law behind the film.  Experts explain the actual statutes that impact the characters in the film and how they are realistically played out in the story.  It added a lot to the film, basing the plot on more than than just getting off on "a technicality."  The extras add to the film experience.  Well worth the money; I'll definitely watch this again.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Been Done Before and Better ..."></head><body><p>Generally speaking, I'm really not much a fan of just gratuitous violence or gore, but I MORE then understand its place in the world of horror movies.  Sometimes the point of a horror movie becomes more about its ability to shock and &quot;push the envelope&quot; of the imaginary borders of its 'R' rating then about the actual story within the movie.<p>I know how strange that sounds, but think of a movie like the original 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre.'  Tobe Hooper was less concerned with the audience building up any emotional attachment to his characters as he was trying to freak out the audience with scenes of death and dismemberment that you'd NEVER even think possible for an 'R' movie.<p>Where am I going with this?  Well, 'Wrong Turn' didn't do any of this.  I was really surprised this was as tame as it was.  I mean, if you're going to make a movie about inbred, mountain-men, cannibals, then take it all the way and try and do something really outrageous.  Why settle for something that movies like 'The Hills Have Eyes' or 'TCM' have done better before.  Your audience for this type of movie is DARING you to show them something they've never though possible.  Do something that would have the MPAA white as a sheet when the house lights come on.<p>I felt like this just was a movie that wanted to do a lot more, but, for whatever reason, pulled back its punch at the last minute.  It's a solid outing for (director) Rob Schmidt though, and I'm curious enough to see his next movie.  I want to know if he held back here or was he being restrained?  His next film may be a better indicator of his true creativity.</p></body></html>

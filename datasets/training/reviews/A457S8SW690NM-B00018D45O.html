<meta name="summary" content="Wow, actually a good/ solid horror movie"></head><body><p>I watched this movie on Friday the 13th expecting a stupid horror movie that I would laugh at and not be scared at all. But, actually, it was a good movie that had a couple scary and tense moments. The movie is disturbing and is based on a true story. It's about a chainsaw wielding maniac that hacked a group of youngsters up. It's in the middle of nowhere and this nutcase also has some allies... Well, a group of friends led by the gorgeous Jessica Biel are driving in Texas when a lady just walks in the middle of the road. They take her in the car trying to help her but she says that "he's going to get her". She then commits suicide by shooting herself in the mouth in a very disturbing but wonderfully made (filmed) scene. This group of youngsters then find out that the sheriff wants to mmet them at an old mill, which sounds suspicious. But when he doesn't show and one by one they start dissapearing, the group's nervous, especially after there's a guy running after them with a chainsaw. The movie has some thrills, scary moments, and humor and is surprisingly a good movie. Mark this one down as a surprise and it's definitely worth a rent.<br /><br />But, what I don't understand is:<br /><br />1. How can that absolutley huge maniac wielding a huge chainsaw run as fast as very fit and athlethic youngsters?<br /><br />2. How does the maniac start his chainsaw after one of his arms gets chopped off? With his teeth?</p></body></html>

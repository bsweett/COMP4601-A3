Big Fish's interesting. The concept glorifies the script using appropriate character combinations. Its a big movie of its own sort. I wouldn't say its one of the best films I have seen without seeing it again.<br /><br />The much celebrated father's character in this movie is quite empowering. There are movies that I like and appreciate because they are well wound out as in the story relating is pretty solid. I liked OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU for it tales of past vast country lands and inane yet imaginable people.<br /><br />I liked Big Fish more for the eyes, the small trespasses and the fact that "A big fish remains a small fish if kept in a small pond"<br /><br />Cheesy? Go watch the film , lovers :)</p></body></html>

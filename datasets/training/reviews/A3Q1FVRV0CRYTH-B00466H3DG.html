Kate deserved her oscar over Hilery, even though Hilery was moving none the less...and whats up with Jim Carreys oscar snub.  He reaked oscar in his role here as Joel, a man who falls in love with a spontanious yet charming Clementine (Winslet) only to have his happiness cut short when Clementine has Joel erased from her memory.  Now Joel, in an act of haste, decides to have her removed as well and so he does, but while undergoing the procedure he realizes he doesn't want the memories gone and so he fights to hide Clementine in other places of his mind so he can keep her forever.  It's a unique look on life and how we as humans, while striving to move on never should forget the past for it makes us who we are.</p></body></html>

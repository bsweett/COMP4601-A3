What's nice about this movie is that it makes no attempt to explain the plot lunacies - it simply invites you to join in the fun.  If you do, you'll love it, it's a good natured, charming romance with a sweet - and certainly symbolic - twist.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock is a consistently excellent actress, able to express a great deal of emotion with the smallest glance.  Keanu Reeves, by contrast, could be out-acted by a jar of olives - he has work to do before he could be described as wooden.  Listen to how he reads in the scenes where he is not on screen - simply awful.<br /><br />For contrast, listen to Shoreh Aghdashloo - Kate's co-worker and friend.  That, my friends, is a voice.  Ms. Aghdashloo could read quarterly crop reports and make them sound like 120 Days At Sodom.  Back story of emotionally inaccessible dad really not necessary.  Ignore the flotsam and jetsam and cheer for these ambitious lovers trying to conquer time - as if holding a normal relationship together isn't hard enough!</p></body></html>

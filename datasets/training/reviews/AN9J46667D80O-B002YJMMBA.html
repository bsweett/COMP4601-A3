The source material for that film was pretty weak. Angels and Demons, thankfully, has stronger source material and is, also thankfully, a far better film.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of a group of terrorists who get their hands on some anti-matter and hide it somewhere in the Vatican, promising to blow the place sky-high. They haven't any demands or anything like that. They just plan to blow it up as revenge for an act the Vatican did back in the late 1600's. The Vatican, in the midst of trying to elect a new Pope, calls in symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), to find the bomb and save the day.<br /><br />And that's pretty much it for the plot. What follows is a series of chases through Rome, searches through archives and a lot of eye-rolling on the part of the audience. Well, at least on the part of anyone who knows anything about the Illuminati (which contrary to the story, was not founded 400 years ago and which Galileo very likely did not belong to, given that it was founded over a century after his death). Also near as I'm aware the LHC does not generate anti-matter. That's not what it's built to do, and we already have other ways to make the stuff.<br /><br />But despite the large amount of eye-rolling and suspension of disbelief that's required, the film largely works. Tom Hanks does his usual good job, and the supporting cast is acceptable, if nothing to write home about. The movie also changes several of the more preposterous things from the book (we don't get the reporter subplot, and the film makes it clear that, hey, news stations actually go to places and film stories rather than standing in front of green screens, though ironically, I bet while filming the movie that's what they did), and in doing so turns it into a better story. It's still not great (but how can it be?), but it is at least entertaining.<br /><br />I don't know. There's not a lot to say about this movie, really. It was fun, it was interesting, it was entertaining and I'm sure two months down the line I'll be hard-pressed to really remember anything about it.</p></body></html>

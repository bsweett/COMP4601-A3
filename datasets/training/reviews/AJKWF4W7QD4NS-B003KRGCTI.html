<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly good"></head><body><p>There's something about Denzel Washington that makes just about anything he appears in all the cooler.  Take The Book of Eli for example: a post-apocalyptic action vehicle that comes off being better than it rightfully should be thanks to the starpower of Washington, who plays the enigmatic, and dangerous, wanderer Eli.  Eli is westward bound and carrying a precious text that soon becomes coveted by the maniacal Carnegie (Gary Oldman) after Eli sets foot in his town.  It isn't long before Eli and young Solara (Mila Kunis) are on the run, all the while dodging other hazards of the barren wasteland.  While The Book of Eli hardly offers anything new to the post-apocalyptic thriller or action genres, it does feature some gorgeous cinematography and camera work, as well as the most inspired direction to come from The Hughes Brothers since Menace II Society.  The action sequences are violent and surprisingly creative, and Washington manages to be equal parts charasmatic and stoic: he truly makes the film as worthwhile as it is.  Oldman is his usual good villainous self, Kunis is easy on the eyes, and supporting turns from Ray Stevenson, Jennifer Beals, and Tom Waits round things out nicely.  All in all, if you're hoping that The Book of Eli is another The Road, you're sadly mistaken, but if you set your sights a bit lower, you'll come out plesantly surprised.</p></body></html>

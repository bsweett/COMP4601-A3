<meta name="summary" content="The Return of Robin Williams"></head><body><p>One Hour Photo was a pleasent surprise. Not expecting much, having being disappointed with Robin Williams's latest choice of roles, Insomnia an exception, I was really engrossed in this psychological thriller that is not your average dose of blood, gore and predictable endings.<br />Although not a masterpiece, it is nonetheless powerful and very well directed by Romanek, a director that shows a lot of promise.<br />It is primarily a character study, that of lonely photo guy, Sly, who becomes obssesed with a family he has been servicing  for years. It would have been all your average 'Hands that Rocks the Cradle' type of psychos's obsession, had it not being for the wonderful performance by Robin Williams, and the smartly written script. Williams is one of the greatest actors in living memory, and although he has made his name in comedies from his TV Mork days, it is in drama that his talent takes a very different and equally powerful outlet.<br />His words are few and far between, yet his facial expressions perfectly conveying so many emotions..He is anguished, bitter, angry, and yes lonely..very..<br />The scene in the hotel room is very powerful , the outcome of which is surprisingly fresh, giving the usual hollywood thriller standard formulae.<br />In short, One Hour Photo is a very good film, made all the better because of the presence of an able director, and one of the greatest actors ever.</p></body></html>

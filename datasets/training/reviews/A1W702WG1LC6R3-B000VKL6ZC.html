<meta name="summary" content=""Great Horror Remake!""></head><body><p>Malcolm McDowell stars in Rob Zombie's 2007 horror remake.<br />A doctor hunts an escaped killer stalking his sister and<br />her friends. Rob did a good job and Malcolm's great as<br />Loomis. This dvd not only has nice picture and sound,<br />but it's unrated with cool extras. I highly recommend<br />this great horror remake.</p></body></html>

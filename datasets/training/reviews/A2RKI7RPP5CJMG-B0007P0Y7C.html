<meta name="summary" content="Well, At Least It's Better Than "Hulk""></head><body><p>"Elektra" is one of the weakest entries into Marvel's recent string of films based on their comics.  I'm basing that statement on the fact that I've seen all of these films (from "Blade" to "Fantastic Four" and all of the adaptations and sequels in between, including both "Punisher" flicks).  Although it is a step above "Hulk" and miles above Dolph Lundgren's version of "Punisher," this film isn't quite as good as the film that it was born from, "Daredevil."  Granted, "Daredevil" wasn't a real gem compared to its peers, but the character did have a lot more development than found in this film.<br /><br />"Elektra" starts off fine enough, with a high body count that is sure to get any action fan a little giddy.  However, after this initial look at Jennifer Garner's title character at work, we are dumped into a long, drawn out and quite dull series of flashbacks and a sad attempt at the development of a plot.  When the action is on, this film is at its best, although some of the kung-foolery gets a little silly at times (especially the fight involving way too many bedsheets).  There are plenty of villains, but no one ultimate baddie.  Collectively, the villains are known as the Hand.  I'd love to have seen Elektra go at it with Cary Hiroyuki-Tagawa's character, who really seems to be a bad guy in the wings.  Instead, Garner tackles a motley crew of a tattooed warrior, a chick with really strong breath, and a murdering ninja with lightning-fast moves, as well as a number of other, lesser villains.<br /><br />In the end, the viewer is left wondering just exactly what happened.  Why was Elektra so quick to protect the young girl and her father?  She had no clue why the Hand were after them initially.  Why couldn't she finish off some of the Hand while they were tracking their target?  She finished many of them off quite quickly when she put her mind to it.  There are a few other questions I could mention, but they may reveal too much.<br /><br />In closing, this is a ho-hum flick that tries too hard to be both an intellectual film with all of the flashbacks and an action flick.  What you end up with is a fluffy action flick with almost no plot development and zero character development.  In fact, this film had an advantage over other first films for comic characters:  no need to develop the main character.  That was done in "Daredevil," which I have to give credit for building up two superheroes in one film.  That's the one thing that all comic flicks have to fight with initially.  "Elektra" didn't even use that to its advantage.  Instead, it played out as if it was looking for a plot, or at least a good reason, for our heroine to do what she did during the film.<br /><br />I only recommend this flick as a purchase to hardcore "Elektra" fans.  You may want to buy it if you, like me, are a completionist and just have to have every Marvel flick on DVD.  Otherwise I'd rent this film before laying any cash money down for it.  It's okay, but there are plenty of better comic flicks out there to purchase.</p></body></html>

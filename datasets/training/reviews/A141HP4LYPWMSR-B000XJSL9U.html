<meta name="summary" content=""I Have My Moments" ~ The Problem With Always Being The Hero"></head><body><p>'Live Free or Die Hard', number IV in the 'Die Hard' series revisits the basic outline of the first film only in a much more grandiose stlye expanding beyond the confines of one high rise building to encompass the entire eastern seaboard. Bruce Willis reprises his signature role as police detective John McClane and does a fantastic job breathing new life into this now iconic character.<br /><br />Following in the footsteps of another iconic prototype established in the first film, Timothy Olyphant does a superior job as the Alan Rickman-ish, highly intelligent villian as does Justin Long as computer hacker/sidekick to Detective McClane.. Then of course lets not forget the enchanting Maggie Q, sigh...<br /><br />The action is fast and furious, the cast excellent and the dialogue witty especially Justin Longs lines). The only thing keeping this film from a five star rating is the sequence with the jet fighter which was a little too unbelievable for me.<br /><br />My Rating: -4 1/2 Stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Elektra"></head><body><p>This movie was good. Jennifer Garner is one of the reasons why this movie is good. She does a great job of presenting a cold, darker version of Elektra . Her performance to me was not flawed in any manner. In fact the cast overall was decent. The story was very oringinal, and did keep my attention.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Marvel's super hero's.</p></body></html>

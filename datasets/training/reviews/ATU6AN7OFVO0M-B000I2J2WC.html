Places and characters are all exactly what i had in mind when i was reading the book. but thats not the best part. This movie is a real visual book by using shadows on unimportant and enhanced light on important and key parts of the quests and mysteries and you can feel them inside your mind. I'm not here to tell what's wrong and whats right. Jesus had a child? good for him. his child and blood is as good as Rob zombie to me. In the age of democracy and people's power there is no room for any Royal Blood. each drop of blood in each vein of any human is a royal blood.... but the movie sure is a masterpiese and we are talking about the movie itself, not the concept.</p></body></html>

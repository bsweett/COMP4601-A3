<meta name="summary" content="Touching movie"></head><body><p>Bridge to Terabithia is about 2 kids named Jess and Leslie who, together, build their own magical kingdom in the forest. I bought this movie maybe a year ago and was impressed with it and the moral to it. Basically the moral is that you should appreciate who you are and don't let anybody (bullies) tell you any different. I think that really brought out the story. Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb did an excellent job playing the parts of Jess Aarons and Leslie. If you like calm and touching movies, then I recommend Bridge to Terabithia for you.</p></body></html>

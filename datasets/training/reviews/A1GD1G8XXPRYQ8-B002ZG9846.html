<meta name="summary" content="Hit-Girl owns!"></head><body><p>Simply put: I waited for so long to watch the kick-ass. I don't know why it is such a  good and funny movie. And Hit-Girl is totally adorable. Loved her part very much. Red Mist played a good role...a sweet costume and outlook but totally a bastard. Kick-Ass himself was okay. Not my favorite out of them 4 but it's a movie about him and it's damn fine. I am not sure whether there will be made part 2, books confuse me. But I'll be waiting for it. Of course only if the hit-girl will have her part in it. Coz she is so cool. This is in no way just for kids or a teenagers. The movie is rated R for a reason.</p></body></html>

Will Ferril from old school, Christina Applegate from Married with Children, and special appearances by Ben Stiller, Vince Vaun, Jack Black, and Luke Wilson. The performances were hilarious and I couldn't stop laughing. As watching the film I noticed that there is other cast members from SNL in this film. Will Ferril plays Ron Burgundy so well. Will Ferril would have made a great anchorman for an actual T.V. These actors/actresses play there characters so well its hard to believe this is a movie. <p>[the plot] Set in 1970s San Diego, this is the story of local TV anchorman Ron Burgundy (Ferrell), God's gift to the ladies and the area's most respected reader of the teleprompter of the news fit to be known, who finds his position challenged by an ambitious female newscaster Veronica Corningstone (Applegate) who, unlike Ron, actually knows something about journalism. Ron and Veronica then begin dating and fall in love. But when Ron couldn't make it on time for the news they needed a replacement, which was Veronica. Veronica nails it and Ron gets mad because he didn't really take her serious when she said she wanted to be an anchorwomen. Then it becomes a fued between the two. A hilarious film.<br /><br />If you love Will Ferril you will not be disapointed by his performance in this film. He is funny through out the whole film and doesn't get annoying. If you love comedies, this film is definitley for you. A must see film!!!!</p></body></html>

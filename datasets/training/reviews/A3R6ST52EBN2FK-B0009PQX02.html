It was actually several different storylines going at the same time, but easy to follow, and all linked together. I really feel this is a movie that you have to be in a action type mood to want to see.  I feel it totally deserved a number 1 box office opening weekend, it didn't get that, I think it placed number 4, but let me tell you, whether you're a guy or a girl, this is a must see movie.  Bruce Willis was awesome, matter of fact the whole cast was and there was not a dull moment in this film!  Very worthy of your money to see at theaters.</p></body></html>

His screen presense is quite reassuring and his voice being lent to the story adds to the overall magical screenplay.Clint Eastwood,I haven't seen any of his earlier work but I know he's quite an achiever in life. This movie isn't all about boxing but I must admit it made me want to get myself engaged in it. I know I'll be "Danger" but it's all good intentions here.<br /><br />I didn't know what quite to expect from this film.I must say there were times in this movie when all I could is punch my fist in the air with the kind of raise in moods it gave me.Also there were a few scenes that made me gulp.The subtely with which the characters are introduced is pretty good.It explores two different realms in life.<br /><br />You really want to believe everything Morgan Freeman says.He's more than a good man.Hollywood can try but can not find a man better than him to replace the character he played. The scene in which he knocks out a kid half his age did just what a prozac would do to a man experiencing middle aged crisis.It was his 110th.Hilary Swank has this look of a fighter in her each time she approaced all fights. To see her knock out the opposition was enough for me to feel gallops of adrenaline run through me.<br /><br />THe last 30 mins caused unavoidable heartache.

I won't go into details cause I realise there are some people who haven't seen it yet.Million Dollar Baby is a movie I'll derive another meaning out of with every second watch.<br /><br />The one punch line and dialogue I do remember from this film is what Morgan Freeman uses to describe Maggie.Now this has been said before , sung before but never quite put in the way it was in this film.<br /><br />"It's the magic of risking everything to see a dream nobody sees...but you"</p></body></html>

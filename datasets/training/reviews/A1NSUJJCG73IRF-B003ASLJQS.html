<meta name="summary" content="Mystic River (2003)"></head><body><p>Director:  Clint Eastwood<br />Cast:  Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney.<br />Running Time:  125 minutes.<br />Rated R for violence and language.<p>"Mystic River" delves into the unspeakable world of a boyhood friendship secret, in which three young boys were confronted by a mysterious, dark man who proceeds to kidnap one of the children and torture him for days.  As the story moves to present day Boston, the audience learns that the three boys have moved on with their lives, working in different professions and starting families, but the undying enigma of their past haunts their every move.<p>Sean Penn stars as a local crook-turned-fairly successful businessman who tragically loses his teenage daughter when she is found murdered near a bar.  The initial clues lead to his molested childhood friend (played brilliantly by the creepy Tim Robbins), who was out late that night and has begun to act extremely strange around his wife and friends.  Hot on the murder case is the third of the youth trio, a slick officer (Kevin Bacon) who has separated from his wife and searching for more than just answers to a crime.  As Penn uses the underground to hopefully find the killer and put his despair to rest, Bacon's character must interrogate his disturbed long-time friend, in hopes that he really is not the vicious killer.<p>Clint Eastwood's direction is articulate and scrupulous, making "Mystic River" one of the more strikingly effective films of the year.  The first two-thirds of the film are superb, with the Oscar-winning Penn (in the role that he was born to play) morphing from a father full of anguish, into an unwavering maniac in seek of the truth.  The ending is not a disappointment, but certainly unexpected and unusual-perhaps leaving a bad taste in some mouths.  "Mystic River" is a taut, intense film that will certain strike with its excellent cast and direction, but the slightly uneven adaptation of the Dennis Lehane novel may leave some wanting more.</p></body></html>

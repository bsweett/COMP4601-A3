<meta name="summary" content="don't we all want a happy ending?"></head><body><p>Many interesting stories, mostly fluffy but heartwarming tales, blend together in a loosely interwoven tale. The cast is impressive both in number of people in the film and in the quality of actors (Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, just to name a few) and the film is a mad dash sort of romantic comedy careening toward the Christmas climax. The story follows possibly eight couples who are trying to get together, falling in love, just discovering their true feelings, making their true feelings known, giving in to their feelings or saying "to heck with convention", and going above and beyond the call of duty for love. It touches in a shallow, but not wholly unsatisfying, way the various trials and triumphs of different types of love and does so in an entertaining way. The fact that the characters here could be as well developed as they are (given their sheer numbers) is remarkable and laudatory. Still there is something a bit saccharine about the whole thing, but the viewer will probably forgive because the director is new at directing, because it is a sort of heartwarming and cute story, and because the performances are all good. Besides, it was a Christmastime release and everyone wants a happy ending.</p></body></html>

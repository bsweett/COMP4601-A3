Even rats.)"></head><body><p>Writer and director Brad Bird offers a hilarious, generous take on food snobbery in "Ratatouille". Remy (Patton Oswalt) is a rat whose discerning palette has earned him the derision of his fellow rodents and the wrath of humans horrified to find a rat plundering their pantries. Fleeing one of his kitchen adventures, Remy lands in Paris, food snob capital of the world and home to Gusteau's, the restaurant of Remy's culinary hero. The restaurant's reputation has dimmed since the great chef's death, and a garbage boy named Linguine (Lou Romano) tampering with the soup doesn't bode well. When Remy intervenes to save the soup, he enables an unprecedented human-rat collaboration that may restore Gusteau's to its former glory -if the Head Chef (Ian Holm) doesn't sabotage his success.<br /><br />The folks at Pixar have rediscovered how to make an animated film to please all ages. "Ratatouille" is Pixar's best animated feature since 2001's "Monsters, Inc.". Adults will find plenty to laugh at, and "Ratatouille" doesn't run out of steam in 1 hour and 50 minutes. The filmmakers consulted with chef Thomas Keller and hung out in Parisian restaurants to learn the ways of the professional kitchen. They must have gotten it right, since "Ratatouille" has received high praise from French chefs. The film venerates devotion to good food while poking fun at inflexibility. Remy's gastronomic passions delight and entertain. His ambition to be something more than a thieving rat inspires sympathy. And it made me hungry!<br /><br />The DVD (Disney 2007): Bonus features are 3 deleted scenes (15 min), one featurette, and 2 short films. "Fine Food and Film: A Conversation with Brad Bird and Thomas Keller" (14 min) interviews the director and the chef about where they get their ideas, spontaneity, their beginnings, how they inspire and collaborate with their staffs, and their goals. "Lifted" (5 min) is a short animated film about an apprentice alien whose attempt to abduct a sleeping human meets with some obstacles. "Your Friend the Rat" (11 min) is another animated short, hosted by rats Remy and brother Emile. Remy presents the history of the contentious relationship between rats and humans. Emile introduces some rat trivia. Subtitles for the feature are available in English.</p></body></html>

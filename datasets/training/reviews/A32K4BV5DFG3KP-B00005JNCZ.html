<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful heartfelt road movie."></head><body><p>This movie was a moving heartfelt adventure road movie. Two men set out to traverse the continent of South America the long way, that is north and south, on a used motorcycle. The scenes are beautiful and the people that they meet even more so. This movie is not political and does not want you to take any view on the labor party or any other party. It is just a buddy story about two guys challenging their self emotionally, physically, but most of all spiritually. You want to weep at the ending because their adventure is over</p></body></html>

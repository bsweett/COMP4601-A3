I enjoyed it and thought it was very well made, especially for a first time write and director. There are some very funny moments but it is not hilarious as I've seen some reviewers say. It is a very good character piece that is quirky and odd but not too much so that it turns you off.<br /><br />Zach Braff plays an emotionally disconnected actor who comes home for the first time in 9 years for his mother's funeral. He spends his time reconnecting with old friends and avoiding his father. He meets Natalie Portman's character, an odd girl who he falls in love with. I liked the way the romance was underplayed and yet was integral in Braff's character beginning to come to terms with things in his life. I thought Portman was great in this movie, although the character could be slightly annoying.<br /><br />Overall, Garden State is funny, but not hilarious. It's very well done, if a little too slow in pace at times.</p></body></html>

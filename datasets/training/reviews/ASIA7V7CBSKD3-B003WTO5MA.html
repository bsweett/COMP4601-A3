<meta name="summary" content="Ryan Reynolds in Remake"></head><body><p>This is a great rehashing of the original.  Ryan Reynolds goes for a change of pace from his typical comedy role to deliever a great performance in this thriller/horror remake.<br /><br />The Lutzs move into a fixer-up of a house in mid-1970s Amityville, NY.  Just a year prior to their move in a grizzly murder occured in the same house.  Now all kinds of freaky things are happening.  But is it the ghost of the prior residents or does this go back hundreds of years when an evil priest was torturing the natives?<br /><br />Whatever it was, it drove the Lutz family away from Amityville, never to return, not even for theise possessions.</p></body></html>

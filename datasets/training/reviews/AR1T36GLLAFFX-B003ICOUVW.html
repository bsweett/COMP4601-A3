<meta name="summary" content="4 Stars for 'The Wolfman'"></head><body><p>I generally enjoy comic-book type films like this.  And this is a good film, made better than average by the stunning cinematography and art direction.<br /><br />Appropriately set in a huge but decaying mansion in the wilds of England, The Wolfman stars the always wonderful Anthony Hopkins as Sir John Talbot, the lord of the manor.  Talbot was married to the beautiful Cristina Contes (Solana Talbot), but she tragically dies before the film takes place.  Talbot has two sons, Ben and Lawrence.  Ben is found murdered, in a ditch. Lawrence (Benicio Del Toro) returns to help find his brother, at the insistence of Ben's wife Gwen.  Lawrence has been scarred by the death of his mother, and has moved to America to forget the painful memory.  And there is trouble in the old moor.  Mutilated bodies keep popping up; the townspeople find so many that it brings a investigator from Scotland Yard, Abberline.<br /><br />Sir John is a slightly repellent figure.  Hopkins plays him in excellent fashion (as always), like a seedy, slightly batty older lord, falling slowly apart much as his manor is decaying.  The strange doings in the area (dead animals, and men) don't seem to perturb him too much.  His man-servant, Singh, is still there, helping Sir John with the running of the house (Sir John doesn't seem to do anything; there isn't a farm to speak of, just mysterious woods and dark ponds about.  I suppose the proverbial 'old money'.).  And then there is that brilliant full moon...<br /><br />The film is excellently shot and cleverly put together.  The moon seems twice as large in the skies over Sir John's manor, and it casts an odd light everywhere, including the nearby town, which seems to be rapidly losing its male population.  The colors are vivid and strange when the full moon comes out, and the very environs themselves take on an other-worldly appearance.<br /><br />Recommended.  It's a good film, solidly acted and well-made.  The opening and ending end-pieces of the film, with the tarot cards and the like is especially artful and vivid.  The set design is excellent, the make-up superb, and the costumes so good you don't notice them.  And there are those silver bullets.  The basic plot we've been seen before (so we know what's up when the silver bullets come out); most notably in the film with Lon Chaney, Jr. in the title role.  My only quibble is the film is needlessly graphic and gory.  Please, no more severed heads!</p></body></html>

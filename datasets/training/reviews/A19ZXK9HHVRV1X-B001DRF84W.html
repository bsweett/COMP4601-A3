Director Ang Lee has constructed the film like a giant jigsaw puzzle, with images and events that often don't make a lot of sense when seen in isolation but which, when pieced together, form an interesting pattern once the overall picture is revealed.<p>Lee and his bevy of screenwriters have opted for a darker approach to their comic book material than, say, the one used for last year's "Spiderman."  The "hero" in this case is Bruce Banner, the conventional "mild-mannered" scientist who doesn't realize that he has been the victim of a genetic experiment that makes him (and his underpants) grow to enormous size whenever he is angered.  Unlike Spiderman, Hulk doesn't go out looking to right wrongs, protect the innocent or bring arch-criminals to justice; he basically spends most of his time trying to escape from the army men out to destroy him before he can wreak too much havoc on the unsuspecting citizenry of the country.<p>Although "Hulk" is long, talky and slow-moving at times, it still boasts a few elements that elevate it above the bland innocuousness of the lighter-than-air "Spiderman."  One of those elements is the relationship between Bruce and his girlfriend, Betty, who seems genuinely conflicted about just how to deal with this suddenly gargantuan beau she has on her hands.  Eric Bana and Jennifer Connelly establish an impressive on-screen rapport that gives the film more depth than it would otherwise have had.  Sam Elliott and Nick Nolte ham it up effectively as the youngsters' fathers, the first as a top military leader bent on containing Hulk's deadly and destructive fits of explosive pique, and the second as Bruce's mad-scientist father whose penchant for playing God 35 years ago served as the catalyst for the unique problems besetting the young Bruce today.<p>As to the film's expensive special effects, they are a decidedly mixed bag, to say the least.  Hulk looks pretty impressive in the facial close-ups, but he often appears ludicrous in long shot, particularly when he is bouncing around from boulder to boulder out in the desert.  It is enough to make one thankful that Steven Spielberg made "E.T." twenty some years ago, long before CGI effects ruled the land.  Otherwise, we might have ended up with an alien far less cuddly, believable and real than the one we fell in love with.  Sometimes "progress" is not always synonymous with "improvement."<p>Lee also relies heavily on the use of split-screen images, a visual style that is sometimes effective in capturing the fragmentation of Bruce's mind, personality and world, and sometimes just plain irritating in its pretentiousness and artifice.  Like virtually everything about "Hulk," the look of the film seems both daring and dorkey at the same time.</p></body></html>

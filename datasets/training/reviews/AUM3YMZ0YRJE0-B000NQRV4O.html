<meta name="summary" content="static, superficial, boring, often ridiculous"></head><body><p>Boy was I disappointed by this purportedly "deep" film.  It is about relationships between silly self-important yuppies, with few real responsibilities except to their careers and their fantasies about themselves.  None of them care particularly for the ones they are involved with, but instead are consumed by their own ideals of love.  So instead of working on their relationships, they seek perfection.  This has been done before, and better by others.  The only thing that saves this film from total mediocrity is the actors, who really are good.  It's just that the script offered little and the direction virtually nothing.<br /><br />Nichols is mainstream, but wants to have the cache of an Indie filmmaker.  Alas, he can't have it both ways and so relies on stars to sell the film with their sex appeal.  Idiotic, stilted dialogue passes for depth, and abrupt time shifts - where relationship shuffling must be explained - destroy the realism.<br /><br />Not recommended.</p></body></html>

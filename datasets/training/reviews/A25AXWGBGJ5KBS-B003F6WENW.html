<meta name="summary" content="The return of the great R-rated comedy!"></head><body><p>Yes, consider me shallow and superficial, but every once in a while, I like to laugh during a movie while a breast is flashed or a curse word is uttered.<br /><br />In recent years, with the PG-13-ification of film comedies, we haven't had a decent, smart, fun R-rated laugh riot.<br /><br />I take that back...wasn't "There's Something About Mary" R-rated?<br /><br />Anyways, "Wedding Crashers" is a giddy, giggling comedy about two buds who crash weddings with enthusiasm and aplomb. By their own admission, "wedding season" is better than Christmas. The opening montage sets the stage, as they crash five weddings of varying religious denominations. Right off the bat, you get the sense that they do this not just for the free food and the strategically beneficial female-to-male ratios, but because they genuinely love being there, meeting new people and in some over-arching sense, being part of the entertainment.<br /><br />Whether it's dancing with the flower girl, offering toasts in the native language, or making balloon animals for the kids (all of which can be found in the "Rules of Wedding Crashing"), you get a sense that they almost earn their free admission.<br /><br />As events lead to the big wedding-to-be-crashed, you can see for miles ahead where this film is going. You can in most comedies. But the way this film gets there is constantly surprising and entertaining.<br /><br />And funny. Funny funny funny.<br /><br />Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn make a terrific combo. They take their caricatured personas and humanize them. Wilson, the de facto romantic lead, has never been more appealing, with his laconic delivery and winning smile. Vaughn is the perfect counterpoint, with his hysterical verbal diarrhea being the source of countless classic lines. It's not that he can't stop talking...you don't want him to. And you get the feeling that the characters responding to him in the film don't want him to either.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams, last year's It girl, radiates intelligence as well as a totally approachable beauty.<br /><br />Christopher Walken does Christopher Walken and it works. You imagine people going behind his back, saying "Doesn't the Treasury Secretary remind you of Christopher Walken?"<br /><br />Jane Seymour has few moments, and tries to make the most of them. There will be one scene that most everyone will remember, and deservedly so. She plays with our preconceptions of "Jane Seymour" and she uses it to be funny.<br /><br />Bradley Cooper erases his "Alias" image as a supreme bastard.<br /><br />The poorly kept secret cameo near the end of the film was a hoot.<br /><br />But for me, the dizzying delight of the film was the outright lunacy of Isla Fisher, playing the "level 5 virgin clinger" Gloria. Every scene she's in, she gives off manic fireworks. There's the dinner table scene where she's...well...she's "playing" with Vince Vaughn. If you tear your eyes away from Vaughn's uproarious mugging, you'll see a crazed nymphet clearly teetering on the edge of psychosis. Gleefully so.<br /><br />The technical details of the film and the DVD are all fine. The supplements are enough to whet your appetite after the film, and by all means, sample some of the audio commentary by Vaughn and Wilson.<br /><br />As I understand it, the Unrated version offers a few more breasts, and some extension of "goth" brother's scenes.<br /><br />"Wedding Crashers" is a great way to laugh for two hours!</p></body></html>

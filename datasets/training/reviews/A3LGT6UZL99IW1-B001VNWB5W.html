I found this movie to often be nonsensical and too far over the top.  Yes, the sxf were decent, but not overwhelming, the plot was lame, and the protagonist was a wimp.  I agree with other reviewers - the $10 off the complete version when it's released?! Double-dipping to the extreme.</p></body></html>

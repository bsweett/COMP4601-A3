<meta name="summary" content="Psychological battle of wills!"></head><body><p>This film is a real tour de force dilema . I have always considered this work as a true example of the leadership vision . In a corner we see the single minded leadership of the Colonel (Alec Guiness) who considers a honor concern to build the bridge demanded for the Japanese authority in the camp.<br /><br />But there are other wills who see in this fact the possibility to escape and this commitment will be carried to the last consequences .<br /><br />It is useless to comment it this war jewel , the timeless battle between the epic and the loyalty ; the will against the destiny ; the duty against the freedom .<br /><br />This movie is now part of the cinema story and it is a wonderful example about the leadership means .<br /><br />All the awards this film received were deservedly won .<br /><br />One of the supreme masterpieces of David Lean ; by far, the best brittish director of the XX century.</p></body></html>

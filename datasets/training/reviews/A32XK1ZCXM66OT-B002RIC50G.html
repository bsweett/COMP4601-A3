Gaspard Ulliel as the young adult Hannibal did an excellent job. Li Gong was very good as Lady Murisaki, Hannibal's aunt and only link of humanity left. The Story was good. While the film was suppose to be an explaination as to what made him a monster. Instead the film kind of turns out to be more of a tragedy. Knowing that the horrible things that happened to Hannibal Lecter and his family will eventually turn him into a very dangerous monster.</p></body></html>

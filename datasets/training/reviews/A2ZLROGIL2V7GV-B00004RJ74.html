Looking for something that doesn't abide by regular horror genera rules?  &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot; may be the one to choose.  With a sizzling screenplay by Quentin Tarantino and perfectly directed by Robert Rodriguez, this is a horror/thriller to remember.<p>The Gecko brothers are two extremely violent criminals who end up taking a family hostage. The family is forced to drive the notorious brothers to the end of the border.  They end up making a pit stop at a Mexican bar, where the brothers are supposed to meet their contact.  However, things get out of hand when it turns out that the place is contaminated with vampire strippers and truckers.  You add all of those elements together and you get one hell of a ride that you'll never forget.<p>I'm not the biggest fan of vampires, but I thought this was an EXCELLENT movie.  It's unpredictable and exhilarating.  You have no idea where the movie will take you until it's all said and done.  This is not your ordinary vampire flick, and that's what makes this movie so great.  It's a breath of fresh air and so much more.<p>The acting really makes the movie what it is.  George Clooney gives a remarkable performance (this was before he was the big star that he is today).  Quentin Tarantino does a great job of contributing dark and chaotic humor to the film with his role.  Other major players include Harvey Keitel, Juliet Lewis, Cheech Marin and plenty more.  The screenplay by Tarantino is great and never misses a beat.  It's packed with snappy dialogue that one would not expect to hear in a horror movie.  Rodriguez does an exceptional job of directing as well.<p>I don't have the fully loaded version of the movie, so I am stuck with the plain version for now.  The picture quality looks pretty good, considering that it isn't enhanced for widescreen TVs.  The sound is really lacking, though.  I had to keep fumbling around with the volume controls throughout the movie, as it kept going from being quiet to extremely loud.  That might be reason enough to get the Collector's Edition of the film.  A theatrical trailer and teaser trailer are both included on the DVD, but those are the only extra features you'll find on this DVD version.<p>&quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot; is a wildly entertaining flick that really stands out from the others.  It has some extremely funny moments, as well as some very scary and exciting sequences.  This movie pretty much has it all.  If you're looking for a horror/thriller movie that isn't like the rest, give this one a try.  This is definitely one of my favorites.</p></body></html>

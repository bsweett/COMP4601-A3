<meta name="summary" content="THIS Is Entertainment!"></head><body><p>I'm embarrassed to say that I had never even heard of this film musical until I encountered it on Roger Ebert's list of all-time greatest movies (I'm checking them out at the public library, and as this title suggests, I'm up to the B's as of this writing).<br /><br />Well, Ebert's correct as always.  This is a WONDERFUL musical, powered by the songs of Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz and a brilliant cast led by Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Nanette Fabray, and Oscar Levant.<br /><br />Impeccably directed by Vincente Minnelli, the movie tells the story of the making of a Broadway show, starring a famous star on a downward trajectory in his career (played by Astaire) and an ascendant ballet dancer (played by a gorgeous Charisse in her first acting role).<br /><br />Outstanding numbers here include the immortal "That's Entertainment," "Louisiana Hayride," and "Dancing in the Dark," although the scenes featuring lesser known tunes are showstoppers as well, including "A Shine on Your Shoes" and "Triplets," both of which must truly be seen to be believed.<br /><br />This double-disc DVD set merits special recognition as well, as the film has been beautifully restored to do justice to Minnelli's brilliant and meticulously selected color palette, and the second disc includes fascinating features on the making of the film and highlights of Minnelli's career.<br /><br />I must also make mention of one of the best film commentary tracks I've ever heard, featuring Great American Songbook scholar and singer Michael Feinstein and his good buddy, the one and only Liza Minnelli, who apparently got to visit the set every day and watch her dad shoot the film back in 1952.  Liza's in an exceptionally ebullient mood here, and both commentators avow that "The Band Wagon" is their all-time favorite film musical.<br /><br />Pick up this DVD set for your family, and you'll see why.  And if the reprise of "That's Entertainment" at the finale of the film doesn't leave you in tears of joy -- well, I wonder what could.  HIGHLY recommended...</p></body></html>

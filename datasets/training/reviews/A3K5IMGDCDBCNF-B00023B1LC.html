<meta name="summary" content="Who needs a name with this kind of action?"></head><body><p>Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, except he does not know he is Jason Bourne.  Damon turns up floating in the Mediterrainian and cannot remember who he is.  So he had to find out who he is.  Almost instantly it is clear he probably didn't work a normal nine to five.  If the movie is about anything, this is what it is about.  What it really is about is the action, good action, and plenty of it.  There is martial arts, a fantastic car chase, and gun play.  The spy talk is slick and interesting.  Damon plays Bourne well and the rest of the cast is also good.<p>Too often, in fact, way too often, movies are made as an excuse to show amazing action sequences i.e. there is no plot (or the plot stinks).  This is one of those films, but Doug Liman, the director, is successful because he never really tells you the film is about nothing because that is what Bourne is trying to find out.  So for a film that falls in the mindless action movie genre The Bourne Identity is exceptional.  Well done.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Girls Don't Cry"></head><body><p>This film, based on ROPE BURNS: STORIES FROM THE CORNER by F. X. Toole, is about as close to perfect as a movie gets in spite of its being about boxing and therefore extremely violent. Director/actor Clint Eastwood (Frankie Dunn), Hilary Swank (Maggie Fitzgerald) and Morgan Freeman (Eddie Dupris) give flawless performances. Freeman is cast here as a down but not out exboxer, the seasoned sage, a part he always does well. Eastwood as the tough, aging boxing coach with lots of psychic baggage, is more emotional and human here than in any role I remember. Swank, however, is incomparable. Apparently there is no part too difficult for her. Here she is the poorest of the poor, a waitress who takes leftover food home-- a fighter in every sense of the word-- who gets the first chance ever to be somebody as a boxer.<br /><br />The film would have been perfect if Maggie's family had been a little more human rather than cardboard versions of redneck white trash and Frankie's Catholic priest could have left the safety of his parish if only briefly to walk in Frankie's shoes. There probably are trailer park types and priests who are this inflexible, but a little more tolerance of them on the director's part would have made for a better movie.<br /><br />The film's ending raises serious ethical questions and makes a profound statement about the redemptive power of love, wherever you find it, and what makes up a family. It is as good as the critics say.</p></body></html>

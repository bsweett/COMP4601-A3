Stepping in front of and behind the camera with a lot of skill and technique. He articulates the technical and artistic details with both cast and crew extremely easily.<p>Having directed some of the STTNG series epsiodes he certainly got his feet wet in the department of special effects photography.<p>There are great funny moments, lots of drama and another time-travel story that is very intriguing and detailed in its goal to save mankind once again. The score once again in my all time favorite, Jerry GOldsmith - and does he set the mood!<p>We have th eBorg to thank for this movie. Constantly trying to assimilate the universe...they make one more attempt to their fatality. They are the most enticing aliens since the Talosians of the original Trek. Alfie Woodard and James Cromwell put in very good performaces.<p>The finally is extremely good with the evil Borg Queen taunting Data to do the dirty deed - in many ways.<p>This is film is fun and adventurous for all. A must!<br />"Make It So!"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""The Illusionist" is brilliant!"></head><body><p>"The Illusionist" is brilliant! The film brought to you from the producers of "Crash" (2005) & "Sideways" (2004). This is one of the best movies of the year and of the summer! The directing and screenplay (based on the short story Eisenheim the Illusionist by Steven Millhauser) by Neil Burger (whose first film was an cinema verite drama called "Interview With The Assassin" (2002), which he also wrote the screenplay to) is brilliant! Edward Norton (a two-time Oscar nominee for his work as Aaron Stampler in "Primal Fear" (1996) & Derek Vineyard in "American History X" (1998) & one of the best actors of our generation) gives the best performance of his career as Eisenheim the Illusionist (who was also coached by James Freedman). Paul Giamatti (recently Oscar-nominated for his performance as Joe Gould in "Cinderella Man" (2005) & was also one of Norton's classmates at Yale) equals his classmate with an impressive performance as Chief Inspector Uhl. Jessica Biel gives a great performance as Sophie, childhood friend and love of Eisenheim's. Rufus Sewell gives a deliciously excellent performance as the Crown Prince Leopold, Sophie's fiancee-to-be. The music by Philip Glass (another two-time Oscar nominee for his work on "The Hours" (2002) & "Kundun" (1997) is excellent! The cinematography by Dick Pope (who also did the cinematography to the upcoming "Man Of The Year" (2006) is excellent! The film editing by Naomi Geraghty (who also film edited "Hotel Rwanda" (2004) & "In America" (2003) is excellent! The casting by Deborah Aquila (who also did the casting to "The Last Kiss" (2006), "Crank" (2006), "You, Me and Dupree" (2006), "Lucky Number Slevin" (2006), "Eight Below" (2006), & "Underworld: Evolution" (2006), Nina Gold (who also did the casting to "Sahara" (2005), & Mary Tricia Wood (who also did the casting on the previously listed movies with Aquila) is excellent! The production design by Ondrej Nekvasil is excellent! The set decoration by Petra Habova is excellent! The costume design by Ngila Dickson (who also did the costume design to the "Lord Of The Rings" trilogy, was Oscar-nominated for her work on the first "Lord Of The Rings" & won for her on the third "Lord Of The Rings", "Heavenly Creatures" (1994), "The Last Samurai" (2003), was Oscar-nominated for her work, "Without A Paddle" (2004), and the upcoming "Blood Diamond" (2006) is excellent! This is one of the best movies of the year! A rare movie that lets people know this is why movies like this are made and more like this should be made.</p></body></html>

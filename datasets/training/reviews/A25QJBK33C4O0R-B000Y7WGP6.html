<meta name="summary" content="Solid, not spectacular... perhaps a bit too neatly wrapped..."></head><body><p>I don't want to keep a potential viewer from watching the film as it really deserves a viewing, but personally I feel a bit as if the movie offers an ending just a bit too conveniently and neatly.<br /><br />In reality terrorism, at least of the type displayed within the film, is a very messy and very complicated life.  Finding a bad guy is tough enough in your own back yard, but finding a bad guy on foreign soil, in a land where there are many followers of such a bad guy is not going to be something that would be delivered in such a neat little package.  If it was so neat and easy, we'd have captured or killed the bin Laden types a long time ago, rather than seeing several volunteers popping up to take the place of the Lieutenants that we have been able to take down.<br /><br />The Kingdom presents fictional events and takes literary license and liberty with the levels of cooperation we might expect to see in solving an act of terrorism on hostile soil.  The actors here do a respectable job of presenting the story they've been given.  Jamie Foxx plays his role well, the always reliable and steady Chris Cooper does as well.  Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner do well enough in their roles too.<br /><br />Some reviewers complain a bit that Garner seems to be in the movie only to offer up tears, but I think those reviewers are missing the point by a mile and aren't catching the little lessons of how life in the western world differs from life in the Muslim world, especially when it comes to treatment of women.<br /><br />As noted in the title for this review, this is a solid film, though not spectacular.  Well worth viewing, with some interesting special features and extras available to enhance the experience (the various points of views of the climatic sequence in the film as an example).  See it if you have the opportunity but be forewarned that there are, as with any film really, some political messages hidden away within the film.  Not the type that beat one over the head in the manner of say an acceptance speech at the Academy Awards, but some messages none the less.  Mostly there to get viewers to *think* and that isn't such a bad thing really.</p></body></html>

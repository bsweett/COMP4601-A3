<meta name="summary" content="I wish the plot justified the cool tech aspects"></head><body><p>There were some interesting scenes in this comic book adaptation by Mike Mignola, but ultimately, the hackneyed plot and confusing storyline outweighed the nifty artistic flourishes. The movie begins in WWII-era Russia, where the nazis open a gate to hell for just long enough to allow a baby demon to escape. An American scientist adopts him and raises him as a force for good. We then cut to present day, where a full grown Hellboy is teamed with other mutants to go get the bad boys at the behest of the government. But when the old nazis return from the dead to take their revenge, Hellboy has his most challenging adventure yet.<br /><br />  Some of the fight scenes are really cool, as are some of the character concepts (one of the villains is a clockwork assassin, for example). And Perlman's acting combined with his cool makeup job carry most of his scenes. There are also some funny moments that Perlman brings off exceptionally well, as when he jealously shadows Selma Blair when she has some intimate moments with a mutual acquaintance. Ultimately, thought, the action scenes get more dominant and less interesting, leading to a climax that is all about tying up loose ends.</p></body></html>

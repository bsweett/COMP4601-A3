<meta name="summary" content="The Da Vinci Code is a Cinematic Failure"></head><body><p>Everybody participating in this film probably never stood a chance. Incredibly gifted actors like Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, and Ian McKellen were compelled to utter the most banal lines perhaps in their entire careers. I suspected the ending almost half way through the picture.  I have not read Dan Brown's book. The fact that the novel revolves around the possibility of a generation-to-generation conspiracy is inherently preposterous.  Real people rarely keep secrets. A large number never do. The very premise of The Da Vinci Code contradicts everything we know about human psychology. Homo sapiens do not remain loyal to a religious institution they know is premised upon lies. Moreover, they are especially unlikely to murder on its behalf.  I may be an ex-Catholic, but I refuse to indulge in blind hatred towards my former religious home. The Church of Rome deserves better than this slanderous attack.<br /><br />An earlier reviewer perspicaciously pointed out that "The whole thing is like a good roller-coaster ride: try not to think too much about it--just sit back and enjoy the trip." I can't do any better. This is a three and a half star film. Do you enjoy pure escapism? If so, you might find The Da Vinci Code worthy of a few hours of your limited life span. I personally refuse to see it a second time. Once is more than enough.</p></body></html>

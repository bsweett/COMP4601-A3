Director/screenwriter Christopher Nolan takes that philosophy a step further in this film noir masterpiece by controlling not only the viewer's visual sense but their perception of time as well, reconstructing the protagonist's attempts to make sense of his world by reading the clues he leaves for himself (and us) and deciding who to trust in order to understand not only what occurs, but why. In effect, Nolan has rewritten the rule: 'Do not show. EXPERIENCE.'<p>The cast is exceptional, Guy Pearce in particular, and traditional film noir elements are executed very well, with haunting music, taut cinematography, smart dialogue, effective voiceover, and a constant search for motive. Humor is used sparingly and effectively. This is really an editor's film, and Dody Dorn deserves an Oscar nomination for editing this gem.<p>As for the DVD edition, it is a mixed bag. Though operationally a bit buggy, cinematically and artistically the special features are creative and fun. For instance, interesting scenes run behind the menus, and many film clips appear framed as Polaroid camera shots, both fun to watch and relevant to the film's concept. The original idea for the film was supplied by the director's brother Jonathan, who wrote a short story based on the same idea and designed the film's web site; information rendered from outside the time frame of the film, viewable on the DVD as newspaper clippings and notes by Guy Pearce's Leonard, are adapted from that web site. Also included are Jonathan Nolan's short story, an Independent Film Channel interview with Christopher Nolan, trailers from Memento and an earlier Nolan film, cast and director biographies, subtitles in English or Spanish, and a tattoo gallery (which looked interesting, but I couldn't get it to work on my Power Mac G4).  I wish more DVDs would incorporate this kind of material.<p>I was disappointed because I'd heard that on the DVD you could watch the film as if it was shot running forward but that is not here, unless you count running the chapters in reverse from the Chapter Selection feature. I would also have liked to have seen behind-the-scenes footage, especially storyboards.<p>This is a great film to watch with a group (as long as they don't talk during the film) so you can talk about it afterward. Nolan and crew can be proud of this fine film. The DVD extras could have been better, but they are still fun to play with.</p></body></html>

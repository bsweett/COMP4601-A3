<meta name="summary" content="Clint Eastwood is a natural born actor and director....."></head><body><p>...And not many can pull that off. I pride myself in having seen every Clint Eastwood movie. Some were good, some were so-so, some were outstanding. Before watching "Gran Torino" I had no idea what to expect. All I knew was it was about an aging Korean vet living in a neighborhood with Asians. A clash of cultures, prejudice and especially war memories. Eastwood's character doesn't respect Asians; in fact he hates every aspect of them as well as their culture. But he learns as he gets to know them. The friendship between Walt and the Asian boy develops as the movie progresses. I am not going to spoil the end of this gem of a movie but I want to say that the ending could make you feel sad, but it doesn't. Very weird but that's the magic of movie making and Eastwood proves yet again he's a pro before as well as behind the camera.<br /><br />I can't recall having enjoyed a simple movie like this over the past couple of years. It's a delight to watch. Yes, Clint is older, but he's not ready for a retirement home, meaning he can still kick butt (and does so)! In fact his character could be described as an old and cranky Dirty Harry but with moral standards and a touch of humanity.<br /><br />Even if you're not an Eastwood fan, this is truly a great movie from start to finish. I would even go this far in saying that it surely ranks as one of the zeniths of his career. Thank you Clint. You were and are a giant!</p></body></html>

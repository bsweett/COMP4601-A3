All filmgoers who felt that Thora Birch was a mountain of potential after seeing her in "American Beauty" have had their assessments validated - she gives the performance of her young career. Her character not only reminds you of the exact things that ran through your mind when you were 18, but also shows how much more sophisticated the current generation of teens have become in verbalizing these thoughts. The current teen is a master of intermixing angst, irony, humor, and insight and Birch is their perfect embodiment. "Ghost World" follows the adventures of Enid (Birch) and her best friend Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson). After both girls graduate high school, the question both of them have is "what's next?" "What's next" is Rebecca trying to make a life for herself and Enid choosing to remain in her world of irrelevance and mischief. However, she soon reassesses her life when she starts to fall in love with a kindred spirit in Seymour (Steve Buscemi). Yet this love does not stabilize her life, instead it makes it more chaotic and leads Enid to make a fateful decision that closes the film. Birch and Johansson are great and Buscemi adds a new vulnerable dimension to the trademark neurotic supporting performance he so often gives. Special ackowledgement must also be given to director Zwigoff who makes a seamless transition from making documentaries to making a feature. All in all, "Ghost World" is a wonderful cinematic experience and an ideal candidate for future cult status.</p></body></html>

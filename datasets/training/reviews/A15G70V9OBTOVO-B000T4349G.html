While The Forgotten does not have the humor or chemistry of the best X-Files episodes, its ok.  It escapes being predictable by being so implausible.  When the whole thing is revealed, there is no explanation as to why anyone (or thing) would bother tampering with people's lives in this way.  But even if you just want to watch Julianne Moore through a blue filter as she runs all over NY and NJ, with a soundtrack that sounds like Liz Story, its enjoyable.</p></body></html>

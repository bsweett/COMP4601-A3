<meta name="summary" content="Interesting Premise, Clumsy Storytelling"></head><body><p>At first sight, "Splice" (Dark Castle being its co-production company) belongs to the minor genre, namely a sci-fi film about brilliant (and often misguided) scientists doing some morally debatable experiments. As you know, the subject matter has been treated in films countless times since Dr. Frankenstein and his monster, but "Splice" directed by Vincenzo Natali ("Cube") attempts to give some emotional depths to the overused topic. "Splice" is not just a sci-fi thriller. Well, the trouble is, whatever "Splice" wants to be, the film looks very silly.<br /><br />Two maverick scientists Clive (Adrien Brody) and Elsa (Sarah Polley) hired by a pharmaceutical company that wants a new medicine have made a groundbreaking invention: a totally new life form. The genetically engineered "creature" (named "Dren") looks like a human with a long tail. Here is an opportunity for ethical debate or "Species"-like campy horrors. Instead of them, Natali's "Splice" tries to focus the fragile relationships between the scientists and its subject, or something more disturbing.<br /><br />So far, the film is not bad. The special effects are also decent. The problem is, in order to make its point the film ignores details that are essential to building up believable characters. It is painful watching characters (not just Clive and Elsa), who should be enough intelligent to discuss moral dilemma, making stupid decisions over and over again. Those scientists don't even know what they really want. The company is so sloppy in managing their "properties" on which they must have spent millions of dollars. So why should we take the film seriously?<br /><br />It is even more painful watching talented actors playing unbelievable characters exchanging silly dialogs. But the greatest problem is that "Splice" is predictable and boring. Once you get the drift of the story, you know where it is going, and it is exactly what happens in the muddled third act.</p></body></html>

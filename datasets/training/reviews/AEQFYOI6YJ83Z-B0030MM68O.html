<meta name="summary" content="A gritty, compelling, and realistic film."></head><body><p>Action film meets character study in Kathryn Bigelow's THE HURT LOCKER.  The film follows three members of an Army bomb squad (Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty, all excellent) as they bond and diffuse bombs.<br /><br />If the film has one main flaw, it's that there's no real plot; this will obviously be a deterrent to more mainstream war movie fans, who like bombs and bullets and blood, and not necessarily any sense or heart.  It will also be a disappointment to those who want a film that glorifies the war in Iraq, or those who want a film that demonizes it.<br /><br />And yet, it is these three main points that make THE HURT LOCKER such a treasure.  It isn't just bombs and bullets; yes, there are those, but this is a movie with heart.  Likewise, it isn't a "war" film per say; it is a human film, about the people who fight the war.  It actually manages not to take a political stance, which is a move so tedious I previously thought it impossible.  The film is about the characters (specifically Renner's Staff Sergeant James) and how they cope with their environment, and why they do what they do.  In fact, when something resembling a plot pokes its polished head in the second half, the film actually falters; but we quickly get back to the characters themselves, and everything ends on a high note.<br /><br />Needless to say, Bigelow's come up in the world.  We're talking about the director responsible for POINT BREAK, one of those action films (many of which star Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze, or Gary Busey, come to think of it) that's only good because of how bad it is.  However, the directing behind LOCKER is spot-on; it feels real, it puts you on location.  The script by Mark Boal (the scribe behind the slightly more political, but still excellent, IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH) is likewise solid, and the special effects are so real they're frightening.  Of course, a film couldn't be good without solid performances, and we get those here from everyone involved, from the three leads to cameo roles by Ralph Fiennes, David Morse, Guy Pearce, and others.  THE HURT LOCKER winds up being one of those rare movies that is both vividly entertaining and emotionally powerful; it has genuine staying power.  If you want to watch an unbiased look at war, you could do a lot worse than this film.</p></body></html>

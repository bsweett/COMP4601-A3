<meta name="summary" content="You can never atone, Briony!"></head><body><p>The setting: English countryside in the interwar period.  The storyline: 13-year-old Briony Tallis mistakes her sister's flirtation with the hunky hired help and her own infatuation with him to unjustly implicate the young man in rape, and screws up all three of their lives as a result.  Seeking atonement, she works as a nurse in London during WW II, then later writes a book admitting she bore false witness.  Sorry Briony, that doesn't make up for destroying a man's life.  Burn in Hades, you little brat.<br /><br />Keira Knightley is the best thing in this romance involving the usual props and contretemps - misplaced love, tuxedos, perverts, teapots, country estates, falling bombs, French, stuffy accents and misdirected love letters.  As for the movie itself, it's more a vehicle to demonstrate that the actors are, well, great actors.  And they are.  Every performance was top-notch and the sets were lavish, although I could tell the director and set designer were more concerned with English estates than with Dunkirk.  But you can't have everything.<br /><br />I won't give away the ending, but let's just say that overall, though, the movie made me feel a bit depressed.  If you're a fan of the genre, then this is a great addition to your collection.  For the typical moviegoer, however, it probably is too much a downer.</p></body></html>

I know it's just a twist and apparent rip-off of Penny Marshall's classic, Big but this film is sweet and funny thanks to Jennifer Garner. I also think Mark Ruffalo is one of the best new actors to emerge in the last few years, he is so real and vulnerable, I just adore him! This film is fun for the whole family, it's charming and entertaining. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

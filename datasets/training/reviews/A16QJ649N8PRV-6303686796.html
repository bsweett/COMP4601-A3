<meta name="summary" content="An Entertaining Show"></head><body><p>This is really a film classic and one of the better ones.<br /><br />Travis Bickle (Robert Deniro) is a loner cab driver who loves working the night shift due to his insomnia.  During the course of his rounds, he becomes obsessed with a young political operative, Betsy (Cybil Shepherd).  He is a rather strange guy and ends up taking her to a porn movie on their date.  After this bizarre behavior, she wants nothing to do with him.  Unfortunately, he is obsessing on her.<br /><br />His preoccupation with Betsy leads him to a deep hatred of pretty much everything after she dumps him.  One of his targets is the presidential candidate for whom Betsy is working.  Bickle decides to assassinate him.<br /><br />Meanwhile, he becomes enchanted in a non-sexual way with 12 year old prostitute Iris (a very young Jodie Foster).  His anger at the poor treatment she receives leads to other consequences.<br /><br />This is an interesting look at alientation and loneliness of some of the fringe people in big city life.  This is a rather extreme case of it.<br /><br />All in all, this is well done and quite entertaining.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cage Plays a Very Quirky PreCog"></head><body><p>Nic Cage plays a very quirky guy who seems to just be floating along in life.  You find out very quickly that he has a sixth sense about him while he is at the black jack table.  He gets into trouble, but you see him ducking in and out of harms way with extreme ease and wonder what it is that makes him able to do so.<br /><br />In one scene you see him fighting against someone, and then you see that person again, here is where his talent is revealed.<br /><br />Suddenly, the FBI is looking for him.  How do they know about him and his talents?  Also, the enemy is looking for him too?  I must have missed something because I am not sure how they know about him at all.  You see Julianne Moore as the lead FBI agent on the case, she is just great, intense, professional and inflexible in what she is doing.  Each scene keeps you wondering if you are seeing the reality or a flash forward two minutes into the future.  So, there are definate surprises throughout the movie because of this.<br /><br />Although from the same author as the Minority Report and Total Recall, there are definate elements that you have with a surprise or two, yet this is so much less so a full blown scifi thriller as it has little related to that since it not a futuristic movie.  Cage is just a guy with a gift.<br /><br />Jessica Beil is one of his visions, and with her he can see further out for some reason.  When he finally meets her there are some very funny scenes that are 'replayed' that look like great outtakes.<br /><br />The movies climax is just great, the last  1/2 hour is a definate intense thrill.  He goes from the rim of the Grand Canyon to Los Angeles as one long avoidance of disaster.  His gift keeps him safe, so he is almost like a superhero and that is what makes the movie so fun.  The end is a real cool surprise, worth the price of the DVD or at least a rental.<br /><br />I prefer to acquire the movie because there is so much in it.</p></body></html>

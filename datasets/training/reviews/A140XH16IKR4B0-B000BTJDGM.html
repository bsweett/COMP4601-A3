<meta name="summary" content="Jumpy court-horror flick that devolves into cliche"></head><body><p>I'm usually wary about movies that trade on the Catholic Church's use of the exorcism ritual. It's a rare moviemaker who will pass up the chance to show compassion for victims or exploring the nature of evil than of exploiting dark supernatural forces for a big box office. TEER promised to take the phenomeenon of demonic possession seriously, but fell into using overworn cliches and plot devices.<br /><br />TEER purports to be based on the story of a young woman who supposedly died in the midst of an exorcism. A young woman goes off to college, and soon starts seeing and hearing scary things. She is found in odd, rigid, almost impossible postures. Her condition is not relieved by medical doctors, so her parents bring in their local parish priest, who attempts to drive out demons that he believes are possessing her. When she dies (this is no spoiler, as it happens in the first minutes of the film) the priest reponsible is charged with reckless homicide.<br /><br />The film is laid out as a combination horror flick and courtroom drama, with flashbacks between legal events of the present with dramatized scenes of the past. Laura Linney, as the agnostic defense counsel Erin Bruner, does a fine job as a straightlaced and hardworking attorney moving up in her legal firm. Jennifer Carpenter  is extraordinary as the possessed girl. She has such incredible control of her facial features that it's hard to tell where she leaves off and the special effects group steps in. Tom Wilkinson as Father Richard Moore is quite convincing as the humble man of God determined to get Emily Rose's story out in court.<br /><br />It seemed at first that Director Scott Derrickson was trying to film an exocism movie that could be read from a naturalistic point of view as well as a supernatural one. If so, he was gradually overwhelmed by the gravitational pull of cinematic conventions that are trotted out when the Devil makes an appearance. There are scary frosty window panes, people whose eyes go black, morphing paintings and frightening nighttime visitations. The victim, portrayed as completely normal and innocent (a farm girl, even!) is suddenly making weird inhuman vocalizations, injuring herself, frightening animals and running around in the rain in her nightgown. Have we seen this before? But is the girl crazy, or possessed? The film destroys the mystery by having various characters tormented in a peculiar, signature manner. Would the real Devil be as transparent about leaving clues as the Riddler in the Batman series? More damning (!) is the way the film cynically twists the true story of Anneliese Michel, upon which the film was supposedly based. Look it up for yourselves.<br /><br />TEER introduces a few unwelcome twists to the genre. That being medicated interferes with exorcism was bothersome from a theological point of view. Either the name of Jesus expels demons or it does not. And the weird "deus ex machina" denouement seemed tacked on and unconvincing. If you need to suddenly inject a heavenly visitor into the script to give your film credence, you're in trouble. The courtroom theatrics and the final verdict were also unconvincing. I had a hard time believing such nonsense would be permitted in a US court of law. And instead of telling me that Emily Rose's grave was a pilgrimage spot, couldn''t you show me a few dropping by?<br /><br />This is the rare DVD in which the extras actually dimish the film. Learning that some scenes were shot with a full-scale anatomical model did not impress me. The interview material with director Derrickson was banal and pompous -- I don't believe for an instant that he read 2000 books about demonic possession. The interview with the set designers was interesting, though. The movie has an odd, gray/blue washed out palette that they worked hard to create and maintain.<br /><br />Whether intended to play against the genre or, in spite of some fine performances and a few scary jump scenes, The Exorcism of Emily Rose was just another tired old devil flick.</p></body></html>

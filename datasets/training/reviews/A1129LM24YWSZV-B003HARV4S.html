Audiences are astounded by the illusions he performs - making an orange tree grow before their eyes, levitating things, etc. Hearing of these magnificent feats from an impressed Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti), the Crown Prince (Rufus Sewell) decides to attend a performance, bringing with him his soon-to-be fiancee Sophie (Jessica Biel). (Unbeknownst to the Crown Prince, Eisenheim and Sophie were childhood sweethearts.) Convinced that he can debunk Eisenheim's tricks, the Crown Prince demands a private royal performance, and the magician obliges. However, once gathered before the royalty and the court, the Crown Prince is unable to explain away Eisenheim's masterful illusions.<br /><br />Perturbed by the magician, the Crown Prince sends Inspector Uhl to find out more about this magician and how he performs such wonders. During the investigation, Uhl himself develops a healthy respect for Eisenheim, even as he learns that the magician has rekindled his affair with Sophie.<br /><br />Although you'll see the ending coming, this is a great movie. What makes it worth it: the performances of Norton and Giamatti. (Particularly, Norton's lovesick magician. I only wish that being apart from me could inspire such anguish in a man.) The effects in Eisenheim's stage shows are nice as well, and I like it that the magician's secrets are not divulged. Also, I love how the script comments on some rather weighty issues. Eisenheim introduces each trick with a philosophical exposition, which serves as set-up, distraction, and fodder for the mind. Through these introductions (and via the plotline itself) movie plays with the notion of death, the idea of truth and falsehood (i.e. fraud), topics of politics/power, and the significance of public opinion.</p></body></html>

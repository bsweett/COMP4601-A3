<meta name="summary" content="Good, buuut......"></head><body><p>I must admit, I was extremely disappointed with this film.<p>1)It's not scary (although the scenes in the moors were excellent, and turn out to be the highlight of the entire film).<p>2)Since it's a John Landis (THE BLUES BROTHERS, TRADING PLACES, ANIMAL HOUSE), I had expected there to be a TON more humor . . . . . there was hardly any at all!<p>3)The ending is simply atrocious! It's so disappointing, that it's on the verge of destroying the entire film. I mean, the film wasn't very original to begin with (though the living dead segments were cool), but they had to go and use the ending that was used in THE WOLF MAN, THE CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF, and it goes on and on. Shoot the werewolf, see him in human form, flash to the credits!! The whole thing happens in less than 30 seconds (very, very sloppy and rushed).<p>One thing I must say in its defense, however: the transformation scene.  It may very well be the greatest ever put to film!  Rick Baker is simply the best makeup man who has ever graced the silver screen with his extraordinary talents.<p>Not all it's hyped up to be. You want werewolves? Go see the previously-mentioned two werewolf films, or SILVER BULLET and WOLF, and I hear that THE HOWLING is really good, too. It had at least be better than this overrated movie.</p></body></html>

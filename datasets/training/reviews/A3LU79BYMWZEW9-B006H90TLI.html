<meta name="summary" content="Not Much of A Country For Young Men Either"></head><body><p>If you've had water cooler chats about NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, you've probably heard it described as "disturbing"--even by people who loved it.  I recently re-watched the film with friends (neither of whom has seen it before) one of whom said, "I'm glad I saw it; but I'm sure it's going to give me nightmares."  The other just nodded her head in agreement: she was otherwise speechless.<br /><br />Even the film's detractors have to admit that it packs a wallop.  Of course,  since it IS the Coen Brothers, you might expect that the amount of blood spilled would be effectively countered by any number of laugh out loud moments.  Well, not quite.  There IS humor in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, but overall, the film's vision is as bleak as the West Texas landscape it depicts.  Like the preceding films in the Coen oeuvre, this movie drips irony, and conventions are subverted right and left.  There's much that can be savored intellectually and aesthetically.  And then, there's the level of violence, which, frankly, many will find off-putting.  And if law officer dealing with all this carnage is the sharp, but world weary Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones, natch) and not the smart, funny and life-affirming (and life bearing) Marge Gunderson of their earlier masterpiece FARGO, well, you are missing at least ONE leavening touch.<br /><br />Of course, neither the Coen Brothers nor any filmmaker should be required to always leave the viewer with that little ray of hope.  Whereas in previous films, their vision might have been described as absurd, here the Brothers Coen veer towards the nihilistic.  And that will leave a lot of viewers as cold as the film's numerous corpses.  They are, of course, adapting the work of novelist Cormac McCarthy, and reportedly did not stray too far from their source work.  That may account for a lot.<br /><br />Filmmakers as original as the Coens do not deal primarily in adaptations, although, in this film, and its immediate predecessor, the re-make of  THE LADYKILLERS, we may be seeing something of a reversal of that trend.  The brothers have said on many occasions that the source novel was perfect material for them, and I certainly won't dispute that assertion substantially.  I will suggest, however, that in films their original screenplays, evildoers are, in the main, quite human and sometimes even oddly sympathetic.  The only other film where there seemed to be an implacable evil entity was the **COMEDY** RAISING ARIZONA.  And in that film, the embodiment of evil turned out to be quite mortal, after all.<br /><br />Put simply, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is what it is: the stuff nightmares are made of.  Thematically, its themes of happenstance and fate, the futility of our best laid schemes are classic Coen.  No earlier film of theirs has ever weighed on me so oppressively as this.  But I won't deny its excellence.  Whether future films will prove as bleak and (yes) "disturbing" as this one remains to be seen. The fact that they followed it up with the comic BURN BEFORE READING is a sign at least that it won't all be existential angst from here on out.<br /><br />Not that there's anything WRONG with that.</p></body></html>

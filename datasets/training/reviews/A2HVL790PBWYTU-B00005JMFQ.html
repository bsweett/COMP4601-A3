If you're in the mood for romantic comedies that don't shy away from rampant sentimentality and that go for those big finishes in which the romantic score soars on cue, then LOVE ACTUALLY is your huckleberry. I won't beat around the bush. I love this movie, love it for many reasons.<br /><br />First, it takes place during the holidays, a time when - according to these characters - one must tell the truth and one is allowed those extravagant gestures. Director Richard Curtis's inspiration for this film originated from when he languished at the L.A.X. airport for hours and - by dint of witnessing all the folks hugging and kissing - arrived at the mini-epiphany that "Hey, love really is all around." LOVE ACTUALLY, featuring a legitimately all-star cast, tracks its many characters thru the four weeks leading up to Christmas as they struggle and find and lose love. There are at least nine story threads - I just tried counting them off in my brain - and they occasionally interweave.<br /><br />All story arcs not being equal, Hugh Grant is featured in the flashiest one. He plays the new British Prime Minister who arrives at his bailiwick and is instantly smitten with the earthy food caterer (played by a delightful Martine McCutcheon). To give Hugh his props, hands down the best moment in the film is when his Prime Minister stands up to the semi-slimy U.S. president during a press conference. Two other prominent threads revolve around the unexpected romance between a reserved writer (Colin Firth) holidaying in France and his quiet Portuguese cleaning woman and Liam Neeson's grieving widower left to raise a young step-son who's fallen in love with a girl in his school.<br /><br />But love isn't all bright and heady, exciting and new. Sometimes, it's melancholy and dreadful and gut-wrenching. Emma Thompson is phenomenal in a supporting role, playing a wife of long standing who is suddenly ambushed by her husband's infidelity. Laura Linley sacrifices her chance at romance to be there for her needy institutionalized brother. Keira Knightley is the focus of unrequited love, and she and Andrew Lincoln provide my second favorite moment from this film. The sequence at the door step in which a luminous Keira is silently serenaded by Andrew Lincoln's cue cards is simultaneously heartbreaking and romantic as fucl&lt;.<br /><br />Rowan Atkinson has a nice cameo as a jewelry salesman, and it's probably best that Curtis refrained from portraying him as literally an angel (Curtis admits this in the audio commentary). Bill Nighy steals all the scenes as the aging and very blunt-talking rock star who gets one last shot at glory with his Christmas jingle. The sub-plot with that British bloke raring to go to America to find true love, I didn't think that was going anywhere. But damn if it didn't have a nice payoff. I think the only one left I haven't mentioned is the arc with the two actor stand-ins, and now I've mentioned it. That one also has its sweet moments, which is rather a coup, considering that a segment featuring a persistently naked couple engaged in simulating the deed could be construed as a bit sleazy.<br /><br />LOVE ACTUALLY is a sprawling narrative which covers a wide romantic spectrum. Don't be put off by the huge cast because you'll find yourself invested in quite a few of the characters. This is absolutely a chick flick, but, for the manly men, the funny does come in frequent like clock work. Hugh Grant is again very good, with his Prime Minister dance and that bit where he goes down the block, knocking at every door, looking for his food caterer. I do have one neggy, though. I think it's stretching it a bit that Colin Firth's writer and his Portuguese girl can be in such conversational synch while speaking two different languages and not comprehending each other. But perhaps the point is that love is universal and can hurdle silly obstacles such as language barriers and Colin Firth being very British and therefore a bloody cold fish. See what I did there? I reasoned it out and so saved the movie's internal logic. Huzzah!<br /><br />My favorite line here, by the way, is sub-titled: "Shut up, Miss Dunkin' Donut 2003." Heh.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus features: Audio Commentary with actors Hugh Grant, Bill Nighy, and Thomas Sangster and director Richard Curtis (worth it alone for Hugh's good-natured but relentless ribbing of Colin Firth); 10 Deleted Scenes with intro by Richard Curtis (totaling 00:37:14 minutes); "The Music of LOVE ACTUALLY" - Richard Curtis introduces the songs used to score the film and then the DVD cuts to the actual scenes featuring these songs; and Kelly Clarkson's music video "The Trouble With Love Is."</p></body></html>

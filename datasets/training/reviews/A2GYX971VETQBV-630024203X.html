<meta name="summary" content="&quot;First Blood&quot;: A Praiseworthy Action Film"></head><body><p>"First Blood" has to be, without a doubt, one of my favorite action films of all time.  I believe that I enjoy it so much because it does a nice job of balancing action scenes with drama.  Thus, this film does not reek of the overkill violence that plagues the two sequels (as well as the films of other action stars).  Stallone actually does some acting in this film.  His performance as a Vietnam Vet come home to find a thankless country is compelling and his emotional breakdown near the end of the film is fantastic.  There is a lot of suspense in this film and the characters are certainly memorable.  Rambo has a clear enemy in this film, played by Brian Dennehy.  He is not taking on the country of Vietnam or the Russians-he is simply defending himself from a small-town cop.  <p>My recommendation is to see this film and forget about the two sequels.  Of course, any die-hard Rambo fan will tell you that the action sequences only become better as the movies progressed, but they sacrifice much to do this in my opinion.  If you enjoy action films with a little class, you'll love "First Blood."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DIDNT LIKED IT , EVEN ON  BLU-RAY RELEASES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"></head><body><p>I had HIGH HOPE for this movie because of trailer & all those Awards shows they got & all.<br />Yes all in Technical, Visual & special effects is Stunning to watch, BUT story & movie real boring & drags a lot here & there. Almost middle of the movie I just reject it from player & send it back coz..was rental & glad didnt buy this lame azz boring B.S.. & WORST thing about this movie,it is BIG in Visual & special effects  >> Then BLU RAY version IS NOT Widescreen is 1.85.1 ratio/ full screen.. even in 3D version.. should be 2.40.1 or 2.35:1 ratio Format on BLU-RAY for Theather released movie ... is just all B.S about this flick,. Even on blu-ray releases..  didnt liked it, Just gives 3 stars & that extra star for the visual & effects is amazing & worth those awards they got..But movie is Sucked & boring ! C+</p></body></html>

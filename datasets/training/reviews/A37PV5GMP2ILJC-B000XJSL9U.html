<meta name="summary" content="Whoah! Badazz Action Movie!!!"></head><body><p>Techies prove a point in this national security nightmare action drama, when a home grown terrorist masterminds a plan to shut down the entire country, one network at a time.<br /><br />Of course you can figure out that the one thing he forgot to factor into his programme was Detective John McClane, who is still around, albeit a little older, but still an ornery, stubborn, annoying pain in the rear, and as it turns out, still a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />An analog guy in a high tech world, McClane is sent to pick up and deliver a computer hacker named Matt Farrell to the FBI, but as was the case in 16 Blocks, the delivery isn't as simple as it sounds.  Unknown at the time to McClane and Farrell, somebody's been deleting the great hackers of America, and there are no prizes for guessing who's up next.<br /><br />To quote lyrics from Cypress Hill:<br /><br />"Boom biddy bye bye<br />Boom biddy bye bye<br /><br />Step back as I'm kicking up dust<br />For a while<br />As I put mothaf***as to rest<br />And pull their files"<br /><br />Predictably, McClane sets off to get the bad guys, and although a whole lot of the movie is mind-numbing techie stuff, with people accessing protected systems with consummate ease, the rest of it is action, action, action, with eye popping CGI, and mega-destruction.<br /><br />Even if you're digitally challenged like myself and get lost in the cyber-warfare, the explosions and high octane scenes are more than enough to make you go "WHOAH!"<br /><br />"Boom biddy bye bye<br />It's time to die<br />Boom biddy bye bye<br />Time to say good-bye"<br /><br />The next best thing to Die Hard, and a must-see for action buffs.<br /><br />Rated: 4.5 stars<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 4, 2007</p></body></html>

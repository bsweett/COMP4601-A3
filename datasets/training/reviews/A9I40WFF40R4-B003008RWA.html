<meta name="summary" content="Depressing Beyond Measure"></head><body><p>Michael Moore tells us right away that this movie is not about the almost fifty million Americans who have no health coverage (18,000 of whom will die this year because they have no coverage) but the rest of us who have some type of health insurance. The stories he selects to tell will break your heart and depress you beyond measure. One patient has to select which tip of two fingers he will have re-attached after an accident. Another is turned down coverage for an ambulance bill to the hospital after a car accident because she did not get prior approval from the insurance company. (Never mind that she was unconscious because of the accident) Another couple had to move into a room in the basement of their child's house beause they could not afford co-pays from two serious illnesses, cancer and several heart attacks. A mother got to see her young child die because the hospital she took the gravely ill child to did not accept her health insurance. Another patient died from cancer because his health provider assessed a necessary bone marrow transplant as experimental. The disgusting list continues.<br /><br />Moore visits Canada, Great Britain and France to see the health plans in these countries that provide treatment at no cost to the patient as well as a controversial visit to Cuba. There is a touching scene where rescue workers from 9/11 visit Cuban firefighters and get much better treatment than they received in their own country.<br /><br />Is Moore always objective? Probably not. After all, he has a point to make. On the other hand, to my knowledge, no critic has yet come forward to accuse any of the people who tell their sad stories of lying on camera.<br /><br />There is enough blame to go around: the AMA, members of congress and the man now occupying the White House-- he makes only three brief appearances and at one time congratulates an American worker for holding down three jobs, telling her, "only in America." Of course her counterpart in France would have free health insurance, a 35-hour-a-week job and a month off a year for vacation. Let us not forget the drug companies, and finally, we the American taxpayers, who put up with such an unfair system.<br /><br />Most of us have our own bad experience with insurance companies, but we hope not as bad as the stories that these partipants in "Sicko" relate. It seems obvious that universal free health insurance is something that most of us will never live to see, a sad commentary on this the greatest nation on earth.</p></body></html>

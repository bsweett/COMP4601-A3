There were a few funy parts during all the chaos. You know how in alot of movies the sick demented people get shot and stabbed and beaten and they still walk around like nothing ever happened as if they have super human powers, hehe. That's how it was with marshall. It was kind of comical when he kept appearing outta nowehere all crazy looking in slow motion. This movie really wasn't bad at all. I didn't expect the band of criminals to be kids, but they pulled it off, considering how sick and demented two of them were, but marshall was like a young ted bundy. There were a few moments that didnt fly too well with me. The only good kid died, the brother of dennis, and to me that was sad, and the beginning was nothing to write home about either. And the violence was so graphic, way more violence now in movies than in the past i've noticed. But overal hostage is a good action film. The acting was pretty good, and you wont get bored. The movie was over before i knew it,</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="NOT BAD, RENTAL WORTH!!"></head><body><p>Well...I really didn't liked the first "THE FOG" back in 80s...wasn't all that and scary...but this remake's pretty good have some suspense and jolt here and there, lots better special effects and was much better an the original one. I enjoy it. But acting was a bit cheesy, specially that  "Maggie grace"! If u liked the first fog or not, and want to have new experience of this movie. Guess better give this movie tries as RENTAL only! ..B</p></body></html>

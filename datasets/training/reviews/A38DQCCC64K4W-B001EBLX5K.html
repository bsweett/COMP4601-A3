<meta name="summary" content="A Little Overhyped, But Still Pretty Funny"></head><body><p>I have decided to longer buy into the hype surrounding any movie. Yeah, right. But I was certainly expecting a few more BIG laughs from this movie...Still, it was pretty much constantly entertaining and downright shocking at times. Cohen def. has some nerve, kind of in that Tom Green 'I'm going to annoy the **** out of you' way. There were only two bits that weren't really all that funny to me(the bed and breakfast and the church...which was just scary!!!); All the deleted/additional footage was priceless, esp. the Dr., the dog pound, and the supermarket.  There are plenty of laughs all around, and like 'Bowling for Columbine', this movie allows alot of the 'real people' in it dig their own graves. And while some will find it offensive on numerous levels, I just found it really funny...'Hey, Vanilla Face...'...Classic.</p></body></html>

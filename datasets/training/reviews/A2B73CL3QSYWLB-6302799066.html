This ranks as one of the great acts of chutzpah in American film-making.  Imagine this:  A dark comedy about a renegade general unleashing nuclear terror released on the heels of the Cuban missile crisis.  Kubrick and his collaborators(that include author Terry Southern) knew something that more serious films (i.e Stanley Kramer's "Fail-Safe") didn't.  They knew that a more effective way to educate the public to the dangers of nuclear proliferation is to emphasize the insanity of it all.  Kubrick assembled a first-rate cast to convey this message.  Peter Sellers plays three roles superbly: the rationale yet panicky President of the U.S., a British group captain attached to the general who unleashes the nuclear attacks, and the titular character, Dr. Strangelove, a wheelchair bound German nuclear scientist whose arm involuntarily goes into a Nazi salute.  George C. Scott is superb as General Turgidson who seems more concerned with beating the "Russkies" with their pants down than averting doomsday.  Sterling Hayden is effectively psychotic as General Ripper whose obsession with fluordation sets these events in motion.  Slim Pickens is hilarious as the cowboy Major Kong whose sense of duty is admirable to a fault.  Interestingly, this role was originally supposed to be played by Sellers but he did not feel he could do justice to it.  Good call, Peter.  In smaller roles Peter Bull, Keenan Wynn, and James Earl Jones do admirable jobs.  As usual, Kubrick's ingenious use of existing music(instead of an original score) is impeccable.  The sets service the film well, particularly the war room with the big board.  "Dr Strangelove" is not just a great comedy but a landmark in film history.  The DVD contains a decent documentary, considering that most Kubrick discs skimp or are bereft of any extras.</p></body></html>

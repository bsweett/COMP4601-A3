<meta name="summary" content="What an odd place to put a bomb!"></head><body><p>A movie that taps into the alter-ego of a perpetually liked actor, maybe even one of the most favorite actors in Hollywood, is always a tempting and dangerous proposition.  Whereas some may go in opposition of their nice-guy fa?ade for a sappy, genre-bridging attempt at drama (I'm talking to you Jim Carey), others, like Denzel Washington, have embraced the dark side of his repertoire, and taken on roles in which their characters are disturbed at best, and borderline maniacal at worst.<br /><br />Man on Fire is part revenge, part crisis, a movie that plays upon humanity's protective nature and sympathies for children.  John W. Creasy (Washington) is a former soldier whose expertise is in death-dealing; he is a firearms, demolitions, and battle expert who has many notches on his belt of death.  Unfortunately, his propensity for alcohol has diminished his skills and marketability, and has led him to Mexico to work as a bargain-bin bodyguard for a wealthy family.  His mission is to protect Pita (Dakota Fanning), the daughter of Samuel (Marc Anthony) and Lisa (Radha Mitchell).  As Pita is quick to point out - and quote stats - there are a bunch of kidnappings in Mexico City, especially when there are unprotected children of prosperous foreign families running around.<br /><br />Sure enough, Pita is kidnapped, and the Pandora's Box of Creasy's vengeance is opened.  I can't really blame the abductors; Creasy didn't look imposing.  However, his worn-down but determined visage belies the cauldron of vindictive sadism ready to explode on anyone and anything that gets in his way.<br /><br />From there the direction of the movie uses a jerky, staccato filming style to convey the internal grief of the characters and the impending chaos that Creasy is about to unleash as he uncovers those responsible for the kidnapping.  I especially like the interactions between Creasy and the Spanish-speaking criminals, as the translation is shown on-screen in a very unique manner, adding to the frantic feel that the window of opportunity to save Pita may be eroding.  Along the way he receives help from a friendly journlist (Rachel Ticotin) hell-bent on removing the veil from the face of police corruption.  He also gets assistance from a former soldier buddy (Chrisopher Walken), who refers to Creasy's skill as a soldier and a killer by stating that Creasy is an artist of death about to paint a masterpiece.<br /><br />I love the film,, but had trouble feeling any remorse for Creasy.  The film sets up for redemption, and plays upon the audience's pathos, but the effort (which works for Pita) just doesn't work well for Creasy - possibly a direct result of his passion for revenge and muder juxtaposed against his seemingly pious regret aimed at his carnage-filled past.  Nonethelss, this movie is superb, and highly recommended.</p></body></html>

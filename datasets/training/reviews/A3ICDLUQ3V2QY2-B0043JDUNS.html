<meta name="summary" content="Smart, Funny, and Maybe a Bit Overstuffed"></head><body><p>This lightning-fast, overstuffed sequel is plenty of fun.  And when I say "plenty," I mean there's more going on than in any season of most TV shows.  This movie has so many irons in the fire (pardon the pun) that keeping up with them is a job.  If I had to find one fault with this film, there is so much awesome content that I can't keep all of it straight.  A little trimming might not be amiss.<br /><br />Months after revealing his secret identity, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark as Iron Man (got that?) has brought world peace, become even more of a celebrity, and lost control of his life.  So he promoted his assistant to CEO, hires Scarlett Johanssen to keep his schedule, and gives Nick Fury the cold shoulder.  But he has secret rivals: Mickey Rourke wants to reclaim his father's legacy, and Don Cheadle as Rhodey wants Stark tech in U.S. Army hands.<br /><br />For a movie stuffed with lickety-split comic book action, this one also carries a lot of smart character development, dry humor, and real-world political commentary.  But you already know that if you saw the first one.  This one contains no surprises; it just pushes the dynamics from the first film to even greater heights of accomplishment.  It's not so much a sequel as the second half of a single film.<br /><br />But as I say, it's overstuffed.  It runs 125 minutes, a hair shorter than the original, but feels much longer.  Between business, politics, romance, heroism, military, and more, this movie has more threads running through than a knitters' convention.  Not one of them is poor, and I loved them all, but when a character comes back after a thirty-minute absence and I can't recall who that is, the film is too busy.<br /><br />This movie made me laugh, cheer, and think.  I enjoyed it.  It has good set pieces, smart characters, an energetic story, and plenty to keep a diverse audience engaged.  I just wish it were a little slimmer, so I could keep all the numerous story elements in mind.</p></body></html>

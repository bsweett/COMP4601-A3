<meta name="summary" content="Classic Noir Mystery"></head><body><p>Still considered one of the top-notch film noir's of Hollywood, The Maltese Falcon has gained its reputation from its well-balanced cast, "tough guy" mentality, and its succinct story and dialogue.<br /><br />John Huston's directorial debut, The Maltese Falcon details the story of one Sam Shade (Humphrey Bogart), a private eye who is trying to get to the bottom of the mysterious deaths that have surrounded a rare and priceless bird statue, a statue that everyone seemingly wants to get their hands on.  Bogart plays the prototypical anti-hero and cynical detective to perfection and, while there are plenty of clich&eacute;s for noir aficionados in the story, the film is not hampered by these. There are plenty moments of intense dialogue between Shade and the two lieutenants who don't trust him, those searching for the statue (The Fat Man, Mr. Cairo), and the woman, Miss Wonderly, who Shade attempts to trust to give him the facts behind the mysterious killings and the statue. Sneering, cynical, and untrustworthy, Shade is by far the most impressive character in the story, and Bogart exemplifies him with his sarcastic smirk, his hearty laugh, his cool demeanor, and his quick temper. What truly makes his performance great is that it is a perfect fit for the novel's version of Sam Shade, and also because he encompasses both good and bad qualities that make him the typical "noir" investigator. Double-crosses, murder, a prized-possession, a femme fetal, mystery: this film has it all.<br /><br />Also included in the DVD is a segment (hosted by Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies) which focuses on the marketing of Bogart films, as well as some theatrical trailers for other Bogart films.</p></body></html>

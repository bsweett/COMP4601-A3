<meta name="summary" content="Super stalker?"></head><body><p>I really liked the earlier Superman movies. Routh does a fair job of channelling Christopher Reeve, at least visually. And I'll suspend disbelief long enough for three impossible things, just to get the movie going.<br /><br />My suspended disbelief collapsed under the weight that this movie loaded onto it, though. Like how Lex Luthor "just knew" that the seed crystal would incorporate other material into whatever grew from it - but not the skin cells left from handling it or the bugs in the water around it. Like why Lois Lane kept dragging her son into insanely dangerous situations.<br /><br />And why we're supposed to cheer for a guy who uses his super-powers to peek into bedroom windows of a former girlfriend and sneak in on her sleeping child. That left me feeling as if I had come into way too much contact with something that I really need to wash off. Yeah, it was all innocent, but ... {shudder}.<br /><br />This movie presents all the super-stuff in pretty much the ways you'd expect to see it, along with Bryan Singer's fascination with things jittering off desks and tables (how many times was that used? four? more?). Between the strange character studies and the unending stream of "where did that come from?" events, I really came away wishing I had spent my money on a different movie.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

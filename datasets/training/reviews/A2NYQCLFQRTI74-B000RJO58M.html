<meta name="summary" content="excellent comedy"></head><body><p>His superiors being jealous of his perfect record, Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is transferred from London to the seemingly crime-free village of Sandford. There he meets his new partner, Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), the witless son of the police chief. A series of shocking accidents upsets the village, and Angel is certain that the village is not what it seems.<br /><br />Brilliant acting, well-directed.<br />Yes, some scenes at the end are gruesome, but they are well done and quite funny.<br /><br />Filled with car chases, gun fights, explosive bodies, this is a hilarious comedy.<br /><br />(Many thanks to a friend for recommending this movie to me; I wouldn't have watched it otherwise, and would have missed on a great British film.)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Spectacular Action-Horror Epic!"></head><body><p>This is one of those films where you just cannot trust the critics at all.  Like last year's vastly underrated THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, VAN HELSING is one of those movies that you know is gonna get pummled by the critics even before the movie comes out.  Not because of the film itself, but of what kind of film it is; critics just don't seem to like these sort of movies.  I for one love 'em, and VAN HELSING did not disappoint.  On the contrary, it was way better than I expected!<p>Right from the very beginning (in a terrific black & white homage to the beloved Universal classics of old), I knew that I was in for one helluva good time!  Stephem Sommers delivers a much better film than THE MUMMY RETURNS, when at the same time using almost all the elements from that film.  There's epic scope, reminiscent of the INDIANA JONES films; mind-boggling production design (the $148 million budget truly shows in the costumes and massive, intricate sets); and great action scenes, which thankfully lose the sloppiness seen in those of THE MUMMY RETURNS.  Alan Silvestri returns for the musical score, which unfortunately doesn't come close to the sweeping grandeur of his score for TMR, but there are still some great musical moments in this film.  But the main reason VAN HELSING truly rises above TMR is for the very same reason THE MUMMY was so great: the tongue-in-cheek attitude of it all.  Action movies like these are meant to be campy, but only to a point.  TMR pushed it waaaaaaaaaay too far, but VAN HELSING does it just right, very much like Sommers' first MUMMY film did.<p>The cast is just plain perfect, as well.  Hugh Jackman is the charismatic hero he always is (not to say that his role feels tired, far from it), and Kate Beckinsale makes for a surprisingly good female lead.  David Wenham is just plain hilarious as the friar Carl, who supplies Van Helsing with all his unique weaponry (similar to Q from the James Bond film series).  But for me, the best member of the cast by far was Richard Roxburgh as Count Dracula.  His performance is nothing short of brilliance, eminating the same sort of twisted, operatic villainy that was present in Tim Curry's performance in LEGEND.  Roxburgh's take on Dracula is a totally new one, for no longer is he the quiet, horrific figure that Bela Lugosi was, nor the intimidating Dracula of Christopher Lee.  No, this Count is now a deranged-yet-contained lunatic (remiscent of Peter Cushing's Dr. Frankenstein); the tongue-in-cheek, mad scientist insanity Roxburgh lends to the role keeps one's eyes glued to the screen, allowing him to easily steal every scene he's in.  In short, his performance alone is worth seeing the movie for.<p>The plot is surprisingly original, adding fresh new takes on several monster legends without dishonoring the originals.  If it's one complaint I have about the film, it is that Van Helsing's actual identity wasn't quite as explained as it should have been.  (That's one thing I'm hoping for the DVD to explain.)  That, and the very ending (SPOILER ALERT!), in which you see Kate Beckinsale's face in the clouds, being greeted by her ancestors in heaven.  I'm sorry, but this was just way too cheesy.  Instead, they should've just shown Van Helsing looking up into the heavens and left out the faces.  But in the end, it's a very, very minor complaint in a 2+ hour movie.  Besides, the final shot more than makes up for it, almost guaranteeing a sequel (which I have mixed feelings about).<p>In conclusion, VAN HELSING is a fantastic way to kick-start the Summer Movie Season, and is sure to please any fan of LXG, THE MUMMY, or the INDIANA JONES trilogy.  Adventure lives forever, indeed!</p></body></html>

Brokeback Mountain is everything you would expect it to be and honestly much more. It is a meditative, thoughtful, well paced & shot, romance. There is a slight chance you may have never watched a love story of this nature before. The two main characters are Ennis Del Mar played by Heath Ledger and Jack Twist played by Jake Gyllenhaal. While these two are on assignment herding sheep in the mountains of Wyoming they discover a similar interest: each other. Brokeback Mountain is a real testament to the fact love can definitely be found in the very unlikeliest of places and between the unlikeliest of people. Love in the traditional sense is not always what we think it is. Overall Brokeback Mountain is a very daring and stereotype destroying outing for all parties involved. Some people may not be interested and others may not be ready. Whether it's your thing or not Brokeback Mountain is a meaningful and enduring film.</p></body></html>

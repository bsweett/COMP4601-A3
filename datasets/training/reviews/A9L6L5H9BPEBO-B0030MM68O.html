<meta name="summary" content="Closer to a Dud than a Blast"></head><body><p>When I pushed PLAY, I expected to be as spellbound as others who had seen this movie and reported the drama here on Amazon. With such high expectations, the only way to go is usually south, and that's what it did.<br /><br />The acting of Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie make them first-class Thespians. They play the part of non-commissioned officers who are in the Army's Explosive Ordnance Disposal, or EOD. It is evident that SSG James finds the adrenaline rush of outsmarting bomb makers and defusing their work. He tempts fate like the matador who moves ever closer to the horns of the bull. He removes his helmet and other life-saving equipment meant to protect him in case of a bomb blast. It looks like he is about to lose his sanity when we are exposed to a scene revealing his humanity, which I will not expound upon. It would be giving away too much of the story.<br /><br />The most effective part of the movie is his return to family life and the mundane chores expected of a husband and family man. There is no excitement in removing the leaves that are blocking the drainage trough at the roof. As an EOD expert, he had to make split-second decisions that could have cost him his life or that of his comrades, yet he looks utterly confounded by the cereals in the aisle when his wife asks him to get one. This is one thing that is not talked about when it comes to veterans returning home. Many will have experienced awesome levels of responsibility for men and materiel that cannot be duplicated in civilian life, and it can be a sudden and tremendous letdown for the ego.  How SSG James deals with this dilemma becomes obvious by the end of the film.<br /><br />If a film spends so much time trying to get into the heads of soldiers under the constant strain of combat, the rest of the surroundings should be equally realistic. This was sloppily addressed with the wrong uniforms, insignia, improper military courtesy, and lack of vehicle markings.  Leaving their posts to chase insurgents with flashlights was appallingly stupid. But what I wondered most about was this "autonomous team."  They seemed to be more rogue than Sarah Palin, and I began to wonder if they reported to anyone or selected their missions by themselves. If I had been stationed there as an EOD and had my choices, I would have spent my whole tour at the compound's Subway, Baskin-Robbins, or the movie theater.<br /><br />I would like to say this film was a real blast, but it was much closer to a dud. The movie just didn't go off for me.<br /><br />I have now seen it, and that is enough.</p></body></html>

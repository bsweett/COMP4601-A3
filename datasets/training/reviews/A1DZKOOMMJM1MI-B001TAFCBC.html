<meta name="summary" content="A deeply moving cinematic  masterpiece"></head><body><p>A beautiful, poetic, thought-provoking film. Top-notch cast, strikingly original story, and gorgeous cinematography. Jim Carrey continues to amaze me, and Kate Winslet is superb. Kirsten Dunst needs more films like this and less Spider-man sequels, and Mark Ruffalo is in top form.Tom Wilkinson is a treat as always. A truly wonderful film that is definitely not for all tastes. For one, it will get you thinking and discussing it afterward. Some people just won't get it, others won't want to, but for whoever does, it couldn't get any better. See it! It's near perfect storytelling. A solid A.</p></body></html>

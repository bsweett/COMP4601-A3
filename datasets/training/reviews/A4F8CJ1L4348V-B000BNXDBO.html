<meta name="summary" content="Great movie even for a gay guy!!!"></head><body><p>I am a gay guy and I loved this movie for all of the "campyness" it had to offer. Two stoners set out on their "quest for munchies" to a White Castle. What I found very different about this movie is that neither of the lead characters are white. It was this little twist that made this movie an "over the top" funny. My favorite part of the movie is when their car broke down and this redneck stops to help them. You will have to watch the movie to totally understand it. I recommend this movie to anyone that wants a good laugh for the night!!!!</p></body></html>

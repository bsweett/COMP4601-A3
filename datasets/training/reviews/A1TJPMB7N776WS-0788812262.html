<meta name="summary" content="Welcome Back Mary !!!!!!!!!!!"></head><body><p>"Mary Poppins" is back and I am glad that she is: all spiffed up, digitally remastered, looking young and fresh once again.<br /><br />It has been many years since I've seen Mary (Julie Andrews) and Bert (Dick Van Dyke) and if anything the film is more fun, the songs more tuney and beautifully performed than ever.<br /><br />In many ways "Mary Poppins" is aimed at adults, rather than children: the Suffragette story line of Mrs. Banks (Glynis Johns) and the honor-your-children-as-human-beings story line of Mr. Banks (David Tomlinson).<br /><br />In other words, "MP" is more profound, deeper, thoughtful and sadder for adults than it would be for children. It works on at least two levels and that's more than you can say for some of the tripe being released recently.<br /><br />At the finale when Mary's duty is completed and it is time for her to move on to another family, I shed a tear for good old Mary and particularly for Julie Andrew's performance as Mary: you can have your current pop icons, I'll take Mary Poppins... no spoonful of sugar needed.</p></body></html>

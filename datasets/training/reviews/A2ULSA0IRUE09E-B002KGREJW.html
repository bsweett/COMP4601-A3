<meta name="summary" content="Paul Dano is the Real Star of this Overrated Monster"></head><body><p>I watched this movie twice - the second time just to understand if I was missing something that the critics were raving about - but no.<br /><br />I think that the only true dysfunctional tale on film has been told only twice - once on TV in the beautiful "Six Feet Under", and once in the offbeat comedy "The Daytrippers" with Parker Posey. After watching both of those, this seems like a poor second cousin, with very little going on that would qualify for so much praise.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - I loved this movie - in parts. To me, the strongest actors were Paul Dano and Abigail Breslin (who I think, is a good actress beyond her years, and a REAL actress unlike the young Dakota Fanning). Paul Dano plays the young Dwayne, and his is the most unnerving and realistic depiction of a troubled teen I have seen in some time. The other characters were good, but the actors weren't really breaking new ground with their performances. Toni Colette especially was disappointing. At one point, I used to watch every movie she was in, she was just THAT good, but of late she seems to be signing every weak film in existence. Weird.<br /><br />Alan Arkin did NOT deserve the Oscar for this performance. First of all, he dies half way through, and secondly, he had the most boring lines and the worst screen presence. That Oscar belonged to Hounsou for "Blood Diamond" - Arkin had no business getting it, as much as I love his body of work.<br /><br />What did not work for me was the climax - granted it is "Sweet", but what about reality? If the intention was to make a comedy, they should not have thrown in the element of realism that they tried so hard to create through the film - it was more of an anticlimax and a very disappointing one at that. I can see people smiling and clapping through the end of the movie, but I was just sitting there wondering "Is This It?".<br /><br />But if you must watch this movie, watch it for Paul Dano, the young star who plays the recluse Dwayne. That was the only good thing about this movie other than Abigail, and to me signalled the arrival of a huge new star.<br /><br />There are other better movies on the same lines out there - please check out the wonderful "The Daytrippers" starring Hope Davis and Parker Posey, as well as the Beauty Contest satire "Drop Dead Gorgeous". After those, you'll be left wondering why on earth "Little Miss Sunshine" is garnering so much praise.<br /><br />An average film. Don't buy it, just rent it. It has no "repeat value" whatsoever.</p></body></html>

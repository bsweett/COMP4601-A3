<meta name="summary" content="My third review for this wonderful movie"></head><body><p>Dr. Strangelove gets humor out of everything possible. The opening credits (An in-flight refueling of a B-52 and KC-135), is the parody of a porno flick, right down to the use of the theme "Try a little tenderness". The names of the targets assigned to the B-52 crew include Laputa (The fictional kingdom in Gulliver's Travels, though I haven't read the book) and Coatloss (Self-explanatory). The battle for Burpelson Air Force Base is waged in front of a sign with the SAC motto "Peace is our Profession" on it. Also, funny are General "Buck" Turgidson's lines ("I think we should hold off judgment until the facts are in", "It's not fair to condemn a whole program because of a single slip-up!", "General Ripper has already invalidated that policy!", "It appears that General Ripper has exceeded his authority" "Gee I wish we had one of them Doomsday machines!"). <p>Then of course, there are some memorable scenes that must not be forgotten.  The phone call between wimpy President Merkin Muffely and Soviet Premier Kissoff ("A man of the people, but also a man..."), General Ripper's obsession with purity of essence and our natural fluids, Colonel Bat Guano's obsession with deviated preverts, the survival-kit contents check (Which includes chewing gum, lipsticks, nylon-stockings and a miniature Russian phrase book/bible), Major Kong's riding of the Hydrogen Bomb to oblivion and Dr. Strangelove describing the 10 females for every male ratio in the underground mineshafts, the Doctor exclaiming "There'd be much time and little to do". Then the Doomsday machine goes off to the happy themes of Vera Lynn's "We'll meet again". <p>Okay, so I just gave away half the plot. But I have watched this film 100 million times and I still like it. You will too.</p></body></html>

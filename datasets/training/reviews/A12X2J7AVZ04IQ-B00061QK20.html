<meta name="summary" content="First and Best of Yimou's "Trilogy""></head><body><p>After seeing Mr. Yimou's other 2 films about the feudal warlords of ancient China (House of Flying Daggers, Curse of the Golden Flower), I have become a fan. Indeed, with "Hero", he has created a world unto itself, magical and mystical, thanks to brilliant use of color (Christopher Doyle's award winning cinematography is stunning) and the exceptional use of Tan Dun's music (with help from Itzhak Perlman). Multiple plots and the interpretation of events make this a film to pay attention to, and at a swift 99 minute running time, it's worthy of multiple viewings. Jet Li, Tony Leung, Ziyi Zhang, Chiu Wai, among others, are perfectly cast. If this is a "trilogy", I think "Hero" is the best of the three. It's truly a visual and cerebral treat!</p></body></html>

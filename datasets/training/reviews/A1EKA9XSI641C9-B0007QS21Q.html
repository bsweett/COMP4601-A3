Day After Tomorrow would come second, and AvP very last.  This is an interesting story that is a little different from what trailers and tv spots promoted discouraging me from actually seeing the movie.  I thought it was going to be just a crap cop movie in the future with a robot as the criminal, it really isn't that at all.  There isn't alot that I can say without spoiling the plot, but I think that you'll like this if you like Independence Day and some other ones.  I hate CGI, but this movie uses it very well (like Minority Report).  I encourage even the stubborn to see this, I think you'll like it better than what people have been saying about it.</p></body></html>

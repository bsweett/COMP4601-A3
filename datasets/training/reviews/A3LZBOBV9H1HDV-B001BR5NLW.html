It has excellent special effects and a beautiful production and costume design. This movie is the sequel to "Pitch Black" (2000) Vin Diesel (who also produced the film) is back as Richard B. Riddick, the escaped convict and murderer who escaped off the planet safely from the aliens in "Pitch Black" (2000). David Twohy, who directed and co-wrote "Pitch Black" (2000) is back as well, this time, it is just his name on the screenplay and story. Keith David is back as well, too, as Imam, who escaped off the planet safely from the aliens with Riddick, as well. Alexa Davalos plays a character from the original whose name is different than it was in the original. She plays Jack, whose name is now Kyra, who also escaped off the planet safely from the aliens with Riddick and Imam. The composer, who did the music from "Pitch Black", Graeme Revell, is back as well, composing a intriguing score in this movie. This movie is as great as its original "Pitch Black". It's fresh and it is a well-designed film. This well-rounded cast also includes Colm Feore as Lord Marshal, Thandie Newton as Dame Vaako, Judi Dench as Aereon, and Karl Urban as Vaako. The cinematography by Hugh Johnson, who did the cinematography to the Ridley Scott films, "White Squall" (1996) and "G.I. Jane" (1997), is excellent. The casting by Anne McCarthy (who was one of the casting directors for "Pitch Black" (2000) & Mary Selway is excellent. The film editing by Tracy Adams, Martin Hunter, & Dennis Virkler is excellent. The production design by Holger Gross and costume design by Michael Dennison & Ellen Mirojnick is excellent and beautiful-looking. As is the art direction by Kevin Ishioka, Mark W. Mansbridge, & Sandi Tanaka & set decoration by Peter Lando. The visual effects by Rhythm & Hues, CIS Hollywood, Industrial Light & Magic, The Farm West, Double Negative, Cobalt F/X, Hammerhead Productions, is beautifully excellent. The stunts are excellent and well done. This movie was well made and well designed, visually. Go see this movie if you want to. Go see it before "Spider-Man 2" (2004) comes out into theaters Wednesday, June 30, if you want to.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A FINE RETURN TO NARNIA."></head><body><p>"The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian" returns audiences to the land of C.S. Lewis' epic world. The film is a fine sequel to "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," but doesn't stand up fully with the original. While the acting, visual effects and action sequences are fantastic, the story is slow-moving during the first half, but picks up in the latter half. The villain of the piece is also a little bit week, which is either due to the actor or the writing. Also, the awe and wonder of the first film is missing for the most part in this film. Still, this is an epic film that fans of Narnia will surely enjoy.<br />Grade: B+</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very violent, action packed movie with surprising twists and turns..."></head><body><p>"It's my favorite movie."<br /><br />I heard this from the person who recommended this movie to me.  Wow, there are a lot of movies out there.  This must be something special to be someone's favorite.<br /><br />I should have remembered that, in our vast world, there has to be a person who claims Smoky and the Bandit is their favorite.  Be wary of favorites!<br /><br />In Lucky Number Slevin, the viewer is set up to a strange set of circumstances.  An apparently random meeting in an airport waiting area results in a murder.  Two really bad guys (the Boss and the Rabbi) have been holed up in neighboring high-rises for 20 years, each afraid that the other would take him out.  Then, another "apparently random" non-meeting in NYC results in a case of "mistaken identity," and the twists and turns begin.  How are all these characters mixed up?<br /><br />Lots of blood splattering, one explosion, a repeatedly broken nose, and some asphyxiations.  No car chases.<br /><br />This is not a memorable film.  It is what you would get if you crossed Denzel Washington's performance in Man on Fire with Robert Redford in The Sting.</p></body></html>

The plots are very simple and pointless but the movies are absolutely hilarious.<br /><br />Mike Myers is genius and makes the movies funny because he plays Austin Powers, Dr. Evil and Fat Bast***. That's lots of talent!<br /><br />Beware because if you didn't know, these movies are very silly and dumb but will definitely make you laugh your head off.<br /><br />This is how I rate the three:<br /><br />Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery- 4 stars<br /><br />Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me- 4 and 1/2 stars<br /><br />Austin Powers: Goldmember- 3 and 1/2 stars</p></body></html>

Still a good movie."></head><body><p>Ok, ok....I am reading the reviews here and I love the passion although some people are either too harsh or making this out to be a masterpiece! It's not either, it is a good movie with some interesting plot lines and solid acting. The special effects are excellent and when you consider the budget was fairly small it gets high merits. The movie starts off very slow and takes some time before it really turns it up! Give it a chance, it is a very good movie.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: The disc is beautiful and the sound rich. The special features are interesting and informative. Not really a 'DEMO DISC' but if you jumped to the end it can be. Worthy of ownership.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Stormy Days of Ray"></head><body><p>Jamie Fox is Ray Charles in Ray, a biographical picture covering the early career and early loves of Ray Charles, along with his struggle with heroin. I'm not exactly a huge fan of Ray Charles. I mean, I've heard some of his big hits, but it's not like I own any of his albums. Still, I thought this was a rather interesting insight into the man.<br /><br />It's a film that's not exactly in chronological order. There are flashes back from Ray's early career to Ray's childhood, glimpses of bits and pieces that don't make sense until Ray comes to terms with them. I'm not really a fan of jumbled chronologies in biographical pictures, but it wasn't too bad here. Jamie Fox played Ray really well, I thought, in his movements, his phrases and his personality. They show some footage of the real Ray Charles toward the end, and I thought they were pretty similar. The way the singing and music was handled was done really well too. I was never sure when it was Jamie Fox doing an impersonation or whether he was miming to an old Ray Charles recording. The sets are also really good, and really evoke the times.<br /><br />Worth a look for fans of Ray Charles, fans of biographical pictures and lovers of music.</p></body></html>

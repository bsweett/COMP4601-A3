You have a family that has a homosexual suicidal uncle, a leecherous drug taking grandfather, the antisocial son who has taken a vow of silence, the step dad who is the world's worst motivational speaker, the little girl who wants to be a beauty queen, and the mother who tries to hold this dysfunctional mess together.  The family wants to take the daughter Olive from New Mexico to California to compete in the Little Miss Sinshine pageant.  Along the way the each deal with personal problems, and a whole lot of troubles with the old bus.  Despite everything that goes wrong, they are determined to get to the pageant in time for her to compete.  This is a fun film that takes a little while for you to get warmed up to.  I compare it to Napoleon Dynamite, another off beat film that not everyone gets.  This is a film worth seeing in the theater, and I hope hollywood makes more of these types of films with great actors rather than 200 million dollar dudes.</p></body></html>

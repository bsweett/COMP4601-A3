<meta name="summary" content="Very good movie"></head><body><p>This movie offers a good peek into Islamic belief. Mind you, I said a PEEK, not a complete overview or anything like that, of course. I enjoyed listening to the conversations between Samir and various Muslim men, especially the one he met at the prison and made friends with, their conversations were very enlightening and I learned a few new Islamic expressions.<br /><br />The idea of double agent is carried out rather well. I don't want to say too much in case of spoilers, but I will say that this movie takes advantage of the double agent idea very well and the scenes and pacing are rather even. It's also very exciting, since Samir is faced with some very tough choices, and also goes through a lot - he has to stay on his feet and a step ahead of both groups, which makes for a compelling movie.</p></body></html>

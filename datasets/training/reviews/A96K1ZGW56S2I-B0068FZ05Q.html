I watched the first twenty minutes of the film before I had to leave. What I saw intrigued me enough that a few weeks later I rented the DVD. Overall, the movie wasn't too shabby. It's got some good action sequences (especially the car chase) and a few unexpected surprises. Still, the ending of the movie was a little bit of a let down, almost too cliched. The audience knew from the beginning who Jason Bourne was almost from the beginning and is left with a suspicion of how the film will end. Nevertheless, it's still kind of a let down--I was hoping for more of a &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; type plot.  Anyway. Matt Damon does a great job as the title character and Chris Cooper, well, Chris Cooper can seem to improve any role he plays no matter how cliched they are. Overall, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a decent action/spy flick. You might not enjoy it, but you'll at least feel like you watched a good movie.<p>The DVD includes several deleted scenes, a behind-the-scenes featurette promo, a music video, and the usual director's commentary.</p></body></html>

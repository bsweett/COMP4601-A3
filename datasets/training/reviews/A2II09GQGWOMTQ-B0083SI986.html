<meta name="summary" content="Eastwood still has it."></head><body><p>I simply have to admit that some of the scenes in this movie had me cracking up big time.<br />When Eastwood's kids recommend that he go into a nursing home, the look on his face is nothing short of hysterical.<br />If you're sensitive about race you may want to skip this movie because pretty much everyone get's unloaded on in this movie.<br />An entertaining look at human relations in America.<br />Maybe not the most realistic.<br />I don't think I've met anyone as hostile as the people in this movie.<br />Amazing acting.<br />Excellent direction.<br />Pacing, score, pretty much everything was perfect.<br />A touching but very blunt movie.<br />I recommend it, it's an eye opener.</p></body></html>

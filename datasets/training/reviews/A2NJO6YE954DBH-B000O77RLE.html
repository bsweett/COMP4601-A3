We like things nice and simple, good and evil, heroes and villains.  There's always plenty of both.  Most of the time, they are not who we think they are."<br /><br />Those words are actually from the beginning of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77QDI">"Flags of Our Fathers"</a> the first of two films from Clint Eastwood dealing with the battle for Iwo Jim during World War II.  That film was about the story behind the photograph of the flag raising at Iwo Jim and what happened to the men in that famous shot (probably the most reproduced photograph in history).  But the sentiments apply as well to "Letters from Iwo Jim," which tells the story from the perspective of the island's Japanese defenders.  The battle lasted from February 19, 1945 until March 26, 1945 and of the 22,000 Japanese troops entrenched on Iwo Jim, only 1,083 survived, with only 216 of that number being captured.  Allied forces suffered 26,000 casualties, with nearly 7,000 dead in the only large engagement of World War II against the Japanese in which the Allied forces suffered more casualties.  So we watch this 2006 film knowing that the Japanese are going to lose and that none of its characters may be alive by the time the credits roll.<br /><br />"Letters" begins with Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) arriving on Iwo Jim with orders to defend it to the last man.  Kuribayashi decision to build bunkers and caves rather than trenches on the beaches is viewed with skepticism by his subordinates, but would prove effective in holding the 5 mile by 2 mile island for over a month against an Allied force four times as large despite having neither naval nor air support.  In other words for the Japanese the Battle of Iwo Jim is like Thermopylae or the Alamo, except that losing the battle is not a prelude to winning the war.  The title of the film comes from letters being written home by the Japanese on the island, from the commanding general to the young baker named Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya), who had to leave his pregnant wife to become a solider.  It is Saigo who is clearly the character with whom our sympathies lay because he is one of the few who really wants to be alive when the fighting is over.<br /><br />Both Kuribayshi and Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara) challenge the stereotypical view of Japanese officers established in all those old World War II movies.  Kuribayshi studied with American officers in the United States and Nishi won a silver medal in horse jumping at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics, so they have a respect for the Americans and an understanding that it is inevitable Japan will lose both this island and the war.  This contrasts sharply with those who yell about death before dishonor, but what stands out most is not the divisive rhetoric but the common human experience.  Nothing in the film humanizes the Japanese soldiers more than the thousand-stitch belts they wear, made by their mothers for them to wear into battle for good luck, and the irony that the most touching letter in the film is one sent to an American soldier by his mother is not lost on us.<br /><br />To say that "Letters from Iwo Jim" is an anti-war film is not particularly insightful because these days you would be hard pressed to find a pro-war film.  As the opening sequences of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001ZWUS">"Saving Private Ryan"</a> amply demonstrated, any realistic depiction of a war is going to convince most people they never want to be in one.  But that takes away nothing from those who have gone to war and done their duty.  It is impossible not to see these two films by Eastwood without thinking about the war in Iraq and it is very disquieting to be thinking that blowing yourself up with a grenade makes a suicide bomber look good.  Kuribayahsi had ordered his men to each kill 10 Americans before they die, so how the suicides of these Japanese soldiers conforms to the dictates of honor is incomprehensible.  Then there is the irony of one biggest proponents of honor and suicide being found in a hole just like Saddam Hussein.  In war heroism, cowardice, stupidity, propaganda, death, and so many other things are clearly eternal.<br /><br />I watched "Flag of Our Fathers" again to see to what extent the two films overlap, but there is nothing that stands out (I read that the American with the flame thrower is the only actor to appear in both).  Basically what the two films have in common is the setting of that rock in the Pacific, with its black sand beach (the film's original title was "Red Sun, Black Sand").  In "Letters" the flag atop Mount Suribachi is a small but significant object seen from the other side of the island by Kuribayashi.  My preference is for "Letters" over "Flag," in part because I am less familiar with that side of the story, having seen "The Outsider," the sobering 1961 film starring Tony Curtis as Ira Hayes, but also because almost all of "Letters" takes place on Iwo Jima and is more about soldiers fighting and dying.  Of course both films look at what the soldiers on both sides were fighting and dying for, which is why you have to make a point of seeing both films.</p></body></html>

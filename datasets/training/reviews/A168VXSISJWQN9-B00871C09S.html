<meta name="summary" content="The Hitchcock style"></head><body><p>Alfred Hitchcock had a unique style and his films are readily identifiable. High on the list is 'Rear Window', which contains several of Hitchcock's trademarks.<br /><br />First on the list is that Hitchcock's approach to mystery thrillers is quite different to most writers and filmmakers (to those who say that Hitchcock didn't write his movies, I can only say that a military commander doesn't fight his battles, but he controls those who do!). Usually in other people's mysteries a cast of characters is paraded in front of the viewer and the game is to guess which one is the murderer. In Hitchcock's films, it's pretty obvious who the murderer is, the question is how to pin the crime on them- preferably before they do it again. In 'Rear Window' Hitchcock plays up this aspect of the movie to its utmost, giving the lead male character a handicap which means that he can't do anything himself and has to act through others. Hitch builds the tension to an edge-of-the seat climax, in which both male and female leads are in mortal danger. Do they survive? Watch and find out.<br /><br />Then there's the claustrophobic setting. Many of Hitchcock's movies are developed from plays, but even when they aren't ('Rear Window' was developed from a short story), he tends to eschew large-scale settings and has the action take place in confined (literally in this case) quarters. This adds to the tension; anyone who has had a nightmare in which it seems impossible to escape a terrifying situation will know the feeling of paralysing fear that is induced and Hitchcock creates that feeling better than any other filmmaker. Much of this movie takes place within a single room, with the world outside observed as though it were on TV. When the TV world intrudes on the lives of the lead characters, they can't escape.<br /><br />Hitchcock liked to work with actors (and crew) with whom he felt comfortable and this movie contains a number of Hitch stalwarts, most notably James Stewart and Grace Kelly in the leading roles. They interpret their characters splendidly and are backed up by the feisty Thelma Ritter, adding light relief. There is also a group of characters whose job is create atmosphere by being observed going about their daily business and Hitchcock makes sure their stories, comical, tragic and sometimes embarrassing, are entertaining enough to make watching them seem a justifiable pastime.<br /><br />Hitchcock's films are always worth watching for entertainment, but the more you see them, the more you appreciate the technique of one of the cinema's greatest storytellers.</p></body></html>

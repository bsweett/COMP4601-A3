<meta name="summary" content="You are one of those English who love the desert...."></head><body><p>Cinematography makes this film great.  I loved one of the first scenes in which Lawrence and his guide are dipping water from a well and see a shifting, ephemeral shape in the distance.  The shape gets larger and seems to be someone walking on water...or...at leasts someone walking on the surface of a shimmering mirage.  A rifle cracks and the guide drops dead.  The 'shape' is Omar Sharif on his camel and has killed the guide for the unforgiveable sin of stealing water.<br /><br />The movie is filled with similar images of the desert...beautiful, deadly and brutal.  Lawrence, in the form of the overly-tall Peter O'Toole [the real T.E. Lawrence was only about 5' 4"].  Still, O'Toole captures some of the strangeness and irony of a very strange Englishman.  Lawrence girds up the Bedoins to fight the Ottoman Turks.  They blow up trains and murder people.  They traverse an uncrossable desert to attack Al Aqaba on the Gulf with guns trained only on the sea.  After incredible hardship they succeed and slaughter the garrison.  Lawrence finds an interesting truth about himself...he enjoys killing people.<br /><br />Confusion about his very nature moves Lawrence in his leadership of the Arab cause.  Lawrence's leadership has, in its own way, become much our own problem in dealing with the Arabic and Islamic powers.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, author of novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico</p></body></html>

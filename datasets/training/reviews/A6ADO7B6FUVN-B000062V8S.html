However, as John remains in hiding he gets into an accident that leads to an encounter between John and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes).  The two of them are attacked by a new and improved version of the original T-800 robot called T-X  that is on a mission to exterminate all future leaders of the resistance.  However, another Terminator robot (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has been sent to protect both John and Kate against this new T-X.  This is the beginning for an action packed roller coaster that will bring the audience through highs and lows at a fast pace that will not slow down until the end.  This does not leave much time for contemplative work, but it does keeps the audience engaged from the beginning to the end.  Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines leaves the audience with a satisfactory cinematic experience where the audience is left with a supreme cliffhanger: a cliffhanger made to make another box-office hit that can bring in more revenue.</p></body></html>

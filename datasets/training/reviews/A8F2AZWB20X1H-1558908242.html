<meta name="summary" content="Pure Golden Pulp"></head><body><p>&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is like a novel with five chapters that was ripped apart and put back together with the chapters all mixed up in random order -- where does it start and where does it end?  That said, it's a  hilarious crazy-quilt of a movie, superbly directed by Quentin Tarantino.  And yes, there is a straight story line throughout... chronologically, the  actual story begins with Samuel Jackson and John Travolta on their way to a  hit ordered by their boss Ving Rhames, and ends with Bruce Willis and his  pregnant girlfriend zooming out of town on a homicidal maniac's stolen  motorcycle.  Each short story in the movie is complete in itself, and yet  each makes up part of the whole.  The actors are terrific.  Jackson and  Travolta are great as the two hitmen Jules and Vince; Uma Thurman is just  right as the boss's wife; Bruce Willis is funny and yet moving as the boxer  who saves the boss's life after the boss ordered a hit on him, and Harvey  Keitel steals the whole movie with his performance as the almost inhumanly  efficient Wolf.  Even Tarantino himself can't resist joining the fun and  plays the role of Jules's sometime partner Jimmie, very annoyed at being  roused out of bed at the crack of dawn to help dispose of a semi-headless  corpse.  There are so many priceless scenes in this film that it's hard to  pick a favorite.  It's a wild, crazy, mind-boggling movie that gets better  and better each time you watch it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Denzel Washington's Alonzo makes this movie.  Also picture quality nearly as good as hd dvd if you want to save$.  Sp Feat below"></head><body><p>Training day is a decent movie but Denzel Washington's character Alonzo is what keeps us captivated.  He plays the type of character that if you just had the  television on while you were doing things and Training Day happened to be on and you had never seen it you'd slowly find yourself drawn to the t.v and keep watching as his character grabs you.  I just watched it the other night and I remembered his character having all these cool lines like Samuel L. Jackson's character did in Pulp Fiction from my first viewing but not so much, granted there are some cool lines but it is Washington's delivery of those lines that make them seem so cool, almost like  how comedians say it's all about timing.<br />Other movie characters that come to mind that I feel there character out shined the movie are Kathy Bates in Misery and Daniel Day Lewis as Bill the Butcher in Scorsese's Gangs of New York.  I would also mention Anthony Hopkins Hannibal Lecter from Silence of the Lambs but that film is great all around as it showed at Oscar time and matches Hopkins performance.  Each of these characters I mention had strong supporting actors to enhance there performance like a dancing partner who is always there to catch and support the other partner.  Kathy Bates had James Caan and Daniel Day Lewis had Leonardo DiCaprio now Denzel Washington gets his support from Ethan Hawke, who did not get an Oscar win as Washington Deservedly did for his role of Alonzo but did get an Oscar nomination.<br /><br />With 493 reviews of this movie at the time I'm writing this and a good plot synopsis from Amazon there really is no reason to go into any plot detail, just wanted to point out A great movie character made by Denzel Washington and the reason this is a must see for his performance alone.<br /><br />DVD<br />The picture and sound quality of this movie were great, I watched The Good Shepard on HD-DVD after this and Training Day on regular dvd looked possibly more impressive.  So if you have blu ray or hd dvd player and like and have this film and are thinking of upgrading I wouldn't bother.<br /><br />DVD SPECIAL FEATURES: (from back of the dvd)<br />-Behind the scenes documentary hbo first look: The making of Training Day.<br />-Feature length audio commentary by director Antoine Fuqua.<br />-Additional Scenes.<br />-Alternate ending (it is pretty interesting giving a little bit more to Jakes day)<br />-2 Music Videos (music from the movie is good if you like hip hop/rap) Nelly's #1 and Pharoahe Monch's Got you<br />-Interactive menus<br />-Theatrical Trailer.

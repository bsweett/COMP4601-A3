<meta name="summary" content="Terrible Waste of Jolie's Talent"></head><body><p>Angelina Jolie was absolutely fabulous in &quot;Girl Interrupted&quot; and &quot;Gia.&quot; She's an absolutely gorgeous woman with acting talent to match--quite a combination.  Why she wasted her talent on this film, an overblown cartoon about an Englishwoman type superhero, is what I can't understand.  Jolie enters the action adventure genre with this film and I hope she doesn't intend to do more films in that genre.  If you like fight sequences, you might like this film.  If you like looking at Jolie, you also might like it.  That's not enough for me though and this film offered nothing else.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="very impressive, one of the year's best thus far"></head><body><p>A film by Peter Weir<p>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is based on two of the novels of Patrick O'Brien (both Master and Commander, and The Far Side of the World, the first and tenth books of the series).  I haven't read any of the books, but any movie starring Russell Crowe and directed by Peter Weir is worth seeing.  Weir is a very talented director (Dead Poets Society, The Truman Show) and Crowe is such a good actor that when he is in a role you don't see the man, you see the character.  That is rare in a leading man.  This movie (as well as the books) is historical fiction.  <p>The captain of the H.M.S. Surprise is Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe).  Aubrey is given his orders: to pursue and capture the French ship the Acheron.  The Acheron has been harrying and sinking English whaling vessels and it is up to the Surprise to stop this.  It's a simple story and this point is where much of the plot lies: in the chase.  The rest of the movie is the development of the friendship between Aubrey, and this ship's doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany).  Over the course of the film (and the long chase of the Acheron) we get to see what sailing would have been like in the 19th Century, and we see how Aubrey interacts with his crew.  He is a compassionate Captain, a moral man who leads without being a tyrant.  We see Aubrey's strong leadership with the crew and his humanity both in his leadership as well as in his friendship with Maturin.  <p>This was an impressive movie.  Unlike The Perfect Storm, Master and Commander captures the feel of being on the ship and really working.  The use of nautical and military terms without stopping to explain each term adds to the realism of the movie.  Peter Weir has the details down and he crafts quite an experience that does not go for the cheap payoff in the chase of the Acheron.  The acting was top notch, and while the supporting cast was not very well developed (I never saw them as individuals, only as Crew) they blend seamlessly into the movie, and into the ship.  I was very impressed with this movie.  It had more of a classic film feel in the pacing and the acting, but Weir's vision was strong and I loved the movie.  Highly recommended for anyone.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars.</p></body></html>

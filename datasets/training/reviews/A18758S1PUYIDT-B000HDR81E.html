<meta name="summary" content="weak ending, but some great dialogue"></head><body><p>Somehow, the ending of the movie didn't quite satisfy; it just seemed to peter out.  The alternate ending was better.<br /><br />However, many scenes contain some sharp dialogue and realistic tension between the lovers.  They might have ad-libbed a lot of the dialogue as well.<br /><br />Good performances and a fairly strong screenplay make this film worth a look.</p></body></html>

This film answers all those questions that crept into your psyche during part one.<br /><br />While KB Pt. I was filled with unanswered questions, many fight scenes and brutal killings this film (Pt. II) is more on a psychological mission than a physical one. In a way this movie is the Western version of the East/West duo. The film still focuses upon the story of "The Bride" (Uma Thurman) and her revenge quest against those who wronged her. Most importantly in this film we finally get to meet Bill, played with interest by David Carradine. Together Thurman and Carradine take the audience on another uniquely original ride directed by Tarantino.<br /><br />KB Part II has less brutality and sadly less Kung Fu. But in this film we are able to understand the characters better and the tortures they are faced with are more psychological in origin. We meet "Bill," and the man "The Bride" intended to marry, Daryl Hannah has a significant part in the saga, Michael Madsen provides some interesting sensitivity, and finally the Kung Fu master Pai Mei (played by Chia Hui Liu) makes his debut training Thurman on to brilliance. This film is done with many black & white scenes and old western type scenes, while the music in the background sounds a little like an old spaghetti western from Italy I once saw.<br /><br />This film is less intense than Part I but more grueling psychologically. One great fight scene is not to be missed between Thurman and Hannah of course! Tarantino manages to keep the viewers interested while creating a completely different movie from Part I, but watch them both and experience something unique and interesting, with stunning visuals and great music.</p></body></html>

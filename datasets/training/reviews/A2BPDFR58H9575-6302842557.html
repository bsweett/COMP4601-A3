<meta name="summary" content="Amadeus - Beloved of Gods"></head><body><p>Mozart is my favorite composer, I love his music, all of it - his symphonies, concertos, operas, Requiem, you named it. I've read many books about him; I try not to miss any concert where his music is performed. I know that "Amadeus" the movie is not exactly his biography, and his relationship with Antonio Salieri, with his father Leopold, with his wife Constanze Weber, with the Emperor Joseph II and with the court musicians in Vienna of 18th century, might not have been exactly like it was shown in the movie, and Mozart himself might not have laughed as Hulce did but I LOVE the movie. I've seen it many times and I still love it. It is about a conflict between a genius for whom to create was as easy as to breath, and a talent that realized that no matter how he tried, he can not be a genius. It is very easy to admire a genius from the distance; it is unbearable to be next to him and to realize that you never will reach the same heights. Admiration, contempt, hatred, denial, self-hatred and above all of these "monsters with green eyes" -divine music that will live forever, music oblivious to the dark passions, music that makes us feel the presence of perfection and harmony...<br /><br />Once again, "Amadeus" is not a biography, at least I don't see it as such. It is a work of fiction and a wonderful film that did not make me see a real Salieri as a villain. Having read many materials about Mozart and his time, and having listened to the music from his epoch, I have a respect for Salieri and his music which is quite charming.<br /><br />Amadeus - beloved of Gods and taken by them too early because those whom they love die young</p></body></html>

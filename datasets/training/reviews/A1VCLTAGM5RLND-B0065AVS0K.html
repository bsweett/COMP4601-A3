Think of it as film noir amped up for a post modern century. It comes across like most of Frank Miller's writing, modestly fantastic for the comic environment, but steeped long and hard in the tradition of the underground crime writers of the 40's. Visually, the juxtaposition of the rich B & W with digital-hued technicolor makes it hard to take your eyes off the screen.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Helen would make a better queen than Elizabeth . . ."></head><body><p>Watch this and it will be obvious why Helen Mirren won the Oscar for Best Actress for her remarkable portrayal of the seventy-year-old Elizabeth II, trying to cope with a world she no longer understands -- and doesn't really want to. The story line covers the week following the death in Paris of Princess Diana, which was also the very beginning of Tony Blair's decade as Labor Prime Minister. Many of those surrounding Blair (played very effectively by Michael Sheen) -- including his wife, Cherie -- were not sympathetic to anything about the Royal Family, whom they regarded as outmoded leeches on society. And while we will never know just how authentic Peter Morgan's first-rate script is, the viewer will come away convinced that Prince Philip and the Queen Mother, especially, had and have a 19th-century attitude of entitlement. Prince Charles comes off as a pathetic weakling, too, trying to sidle up to Blair for his own protection. Because of the Queen's insistence on "privacy," her complete lack of understanding of the need of the public all around the world to mourn Diana, one quarter of the British people toward the end of that week were becoming convinced the monarchy should be abolished. (And that's my gripe with the real-world Blair, too: He had the chance to kill off the monarchy completely but he didn't take it. Instead, he converted to storybook royalism, a victim of mawkish sentimentality -- just as his wife warned him all prime ministers had done.) As a dramatic film (not a documentary), this effort is very, very good.</p></body></html>

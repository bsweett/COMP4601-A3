<meta name="summary" content="Even Killers Need love"></head><body><p>I don't buy the conceit that "Volume 1" is Tarantino's eastern and "Volume 2" is his western despite a predominately western setting and the co-opting of Ennio Morricone scores from Sergio Leone's westerns.  That said, this is a great movie.  Tarantino is still exploring the eastern themes that he did in "Volume 1" yet he is also exploring more mature character relationships that he did in my personal favorite film of his, "Jackie Brown".<br /><br />The likelihood is that Uma Thurman's multilayered performance(one moment she's a revenge-bent killer, the next a nurturing mother) will be overlooked at Oscar time because this film will probably be viewed in highbrow circles as a "genre film".  David Carradine also gives an excellent performance here.  You can almost sympathize with his rationalization for wanting Thurman's "Beatrix" dead for walking out on him.  After all, even killers can get a broken heart.  Not to be overlooked is Michael Madsen's performance as Budd, Bill's assassin brother turned drunken bouncer.  Madsen imbues this character with such pathos that we even like him despite him trying to bury Thurman alive.  The last chapter, where Thurman confronts Carradine seems to labor at times, however, Carradine's dissertation on the "Superman" myth may touch on the primary theme here.  We are who we are even if we try to escape into an alter-ego.  This may be Tarantino's way of saying that his films may be looked down on because they seem to glorify violence, even if their done stylishly.  However, Tarantino makes no apologies for making these films because they contain themes that interest him.  On a final note, the DVD contains a deleted scene that's pretty good.  I can see why it wasn't included in the theatrical cut because it doesn't seem to fit into the basic structure of the film but it should be checked out.</p></body></html>

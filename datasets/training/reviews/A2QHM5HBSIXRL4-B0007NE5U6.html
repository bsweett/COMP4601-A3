<meta name="summary" content="Zellwegger, Grant and Firth try mightily to lift this froth"></head><body><p>Renee Zellwegger, Hugh Grant and (especially) Colin Firth are three actors I'm willing to give any benefit of the doubt to, but "Edge of Reason" really tested my patience in that regard.  These three professionals try their collective best to breathe some life into this slight tale, but only marginally succeed.<br /><br />Blame the material - the original 'Bridget Jones' penned by Helen Fielding basically invented the chick-lit genre (or at least brought it to the collective consciousness of the UK/US public).  Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Love Actually) helped Fielding bring it to screen, as directed by close Fielding friend, Sharon Maguire.  'Edge of Reason' - the book - was shunned by most of the audience that flocked to the original.  It comes across as a stretch.  And what doesn't work in print definitely falls flat on the screen - a call girl-backed rendition of 'Like a Virgin' in a Thai jail (don't ask) for example did not succeed in elicting a single laugh from the audience.<br /><br />Too bad, because these three deserve better.  Hugh Grant was quoted recently as saying he was contemplating 'retiring' from film.  If so, it'll be a huge loss - this guy makes it look so effortless.<br /><br />One other point is how abysmally under-used some of the actors are - Jim Broadbent might be one of world's foremost character actors.  We get a couple of shots of him in a lavender tux.  He has maybe ten (at most) lines througout, none memorable.  A waste.<br /><br />And, amongst Bridget's support crew, we get Jude, played by Shirley Henderson.  Since the release of "B.J.'s Diary," Henderson has gone on to star in "Intermission"  and "Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself," both to critical acclaim.  Yet, she's completely part of the woodwork here.  Another lost opportunity.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Lot of Fun"></head><body><p>Hot Tub Time Machine is a comedy, so let's keep that in mind when we consider it's merits. You should not take this movie seriously. If you do, you'll likely turn it off before it really even gets started, and you'll miss out on a lot of laughs. Sit back, relax, and disregard your sanity for an hour and a half.<br /><br />Adam (John Cusack), Nick (Craig Robinson) and Lou (Rob Corddry) are friends who used to go on vacations to a wild ski-resort in the 80s. Their lives are not going as well as they dreamed they would, so they take a vacation to the same resort, and Adam's nephew (Clark Duke) tags along. Once there, they see how much things have changed, but they're magically transported back in time through the hot machine on the back porch.<br /><br />(See what I mean about sanity? That would never happen!)<br /><br />The interactions between the main characters are excellent, because they mimic real-life conversations. They make lame jokes, they poke fun at each other, they make movie references, they give each other bad advice; it's all here.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie is the fact that it makes fun of itself. This is evidenced in a few ways. First, Crispin Glover plays the bellboy, an obvious throwback to Back to the Future in which Glover plays George McFly. This movie is a rip-off of that one, and the fact that it points this out so the critics don't have to is smart. Second, Craig Robinson uses the title of the film in his dialogue, then looks at the camera with a blank face. This ellicits a good laugh, because once again, the film is making fun of itself. Thanks to that silly, light-hearted tone, Hot Tub Time Machine is a winner, because we know not to take any of it too seriously.</p></body></html>

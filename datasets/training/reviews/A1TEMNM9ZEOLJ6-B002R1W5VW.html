Nicolas Cage's various tics here as an obsessive-compulsive are uncomfortable to watch, though his performance is great, as usual for Cage. The sets in suburban Los Angeles were interesting to look at. Even the Sinatra soundtrack - why, really? - wasn't bad. I guess it was the plot that let me down. Also, is it a comedy or a character study? You find out in the extra that this question vexed the post-production, as well. The major plot twist that occupies the final 20 percent of the film wasn't all that surprising. A passing entertainment.</p></body></html>

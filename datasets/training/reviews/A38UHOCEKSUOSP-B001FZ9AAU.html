<meta name="summary" content="[4.5] Not just a good superhero movie, but a good movie, period."></head><body><p>Man, this thing has been advertised like crazy - I've seen way too many commercials, trailers, action figures, and news all over the net.  Robert Downey Jr. and director Jon Favreu have been more than confident they have a winner in Iron Man.  With the amount of hype I think I got burnout and I wasn't that interested in seeing Iron Man afterall.  Everyone I talked to loved it so I figured why not.  Turns out everyone was correct and you can believe the hype folks - this is one great film, and sure enough one of the best of 2008 already.<br /><br />This isn't your typical superhero movie, its better than that.  For the most part I didn't feel like I was sitting through a typical superhero film.  There is almost a realistic feel throughout this film unlike some superhero films (but don't expect things to be believable sometimes).  Details are laid out on how everything is built and works.  There is a definite maturity within the storyline and actors.  In fact, the top four actors in the film have all had some big awards in their past.<br /><br />There are two parts of Iron Man.  First you've got the Afghanistan storyline and the Obadiah Stane story (Jeff Bridges) who turns out to be the movie bad guy (and gives Iron Man one heck of a fight in the end).  The creators have done away with the outdated evets on how Iron Man came to be in the comic books, and placed the film in a touchy present day situation, placing Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) as a captive within Afghanistan.  This has a huge impact on Stark's life and the man he will become throughout the film (not just the superhero he becomes, but the person he becomes too).  Obadiah doesn't like it and next thing you know we got quite a villain to deal with.<br /><br />The visual effetcs were provided by Industrial Light & Magic and the sound by Skywalker Sound, in other words you can expect incredible effects that don't dissapoint.  Accompany that with great comic relief, great actors and characters, and an impressive story and you got one film you can't miss out on.<br /><br />And as a bonus, this is just the beginning.  Iron Man 2 is already in works.  Though I missed it in the theatre, a glimpse of Captain America' shield can be seen in Tony's lab.  And don't forget to watch the new Hulk film this June (ditch the old one with Eric Bana).  There is to be a Robert Downey Jr. cameo in that film...something is happening with Marvel.  Oh yeah, and don't miss the end of Iron Man, like after credits end.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4.5<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5</p></body></html>

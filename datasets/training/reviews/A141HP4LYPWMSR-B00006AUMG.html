This one rivals the first and posits the proverbial question "which one is the best?" My general rule is the original is always the best, but I accept my choice as subjective opinion and will posit the possibility that I might be wrong.<br /><br />In installment two Blade joins forces with the Vampire Nation to destroy a new strain of the vampire virius which is producing a hybrid creature with a ravenous thirst that hunts both vampires and humans. Now fighting alongside the "Blood Pack", a group initally put together to hunt down Daywalker, the battle for the survival of both races is about to begin.<br /><br />Positives: More action, more blood. Ron Perlman is amazing as Blood Pack wiseguy 'Reinhardt'. The scenes involving the interaction between Blade and Reinhardt are the best in the movie. Also, the inclusion of Hong Kong martial arts legend Donnie Yen as 'Snowman' was a great move. Unfortunately they killed him off much too early.<br /><br />Negatives: The storyline and dialogue aren't as sharp and cohesive as the first (with the exception of the banter between Blade and Reinhardt). Leonor Varela is good as the vampire princess 'Nyssa', but I would've preferred the return of N'Bushe Wright to reprise her role as Blades' potential love interest Dr. Karen Jenson.</p></body></html>

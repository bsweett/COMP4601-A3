<meta name="summary" content="Obnoxious good fun!"></head><body><p>Every so often, a film comes along that is simply too cute for its own good.  Such is the case of MONSTERS, INC.  The dramatic premise of the movie centers around the following dilemma:  what to do when your ace scary monster finds a kid too adorable to play Mr. bad guy?  Oh, my, Nietzsche would have been thrilled with this one...<p>The animation in this flick is spectacular.  Some of the sequences are sort of a cross between THE GRINCH WHO STOLE CHRISTMAS and DR. WHO.  Featuring the vocal talents of John Goodman, Billy Crystal and Steve Buscemi, this is a rip-roaring hilarious good time for the whole family.  Kids will love it.  Adults are sure to love it more!</p></body></html>

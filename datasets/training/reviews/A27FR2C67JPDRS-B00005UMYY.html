<meta name="summary" content="a memento for your dvd collection"></head><body><p>This is one of the most innovated films of 2000 and a really cool movie to watch---you'll need to watch it more than once to catch everything and even then you'll still have questions.  That, however, is the beauty of this film.  Told in reverse and in snap shots, the story is slowly revealed and it is absolutely spellbinding.  I won't go into details because I don't want to reveal too much but it is a great way to spend a night with friends and a big bowl of popcorn.  Guy Pearce is an excellent actor, as are Carrie-Anne Moss (&quot;The Matrix&quot;) and Joe Pantoliano (&quot;The Matrix&quot; and tv's &quot;The Sopranos&quot;).  Give it a try...you won't be disappointed.</p></body></html>

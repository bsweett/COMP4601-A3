<meta name="summary" content="Just wanted to add another five star."></head><body><p>I am usually hypercritical of the formula romantic comedies, action films, etc. that come out of the US movie industry, specifically Hollywood and NY, but this one, despite a slow start and awkward ending was a total surprise. Just thinking about the movie the day after provokes a chuckle so there's a little something special embedded in this movie - kudos to the KA film posse.<br /><br />Let's cut it short - five big ones for this little creative and surprising gem.<br /><br />Caveats to the viewers and to Chloe Grace (Mindy). First to the viewing audience as you already know from other sources there's a bit of profanity and blood - don't worry it's so outrageous it's more funny than psychologically harmful. Second to Chloe Grace,  take everything you said and did as outrageous satire and be sure to hold up as some of your role models truly great athletes who are always in control of themselves. Despite the battles they encounter they don't need the profanities, the fights - they handle it all with artistic intelligence and skill.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Macabre Fun For the Whole Family"></head><body><p>"Pee-Wee's Big Adventure" was director Tim Burton's first film but "Beetlejuice" was the film that made people take notice as to what an original talent he is.  Think about it.  Who else could have made death so much fun?  The script by Warren Skaaren and Michael McDowell may deal with the departed but it's fresh and original with ideas deliciously from left field.  I particularly liked the waiting room for the recently departed and the case worker played by Sylvia Sidney.  Bo Welch's art direction is highly imaginative as is the Oscar winning make-up effects.  Michael Keaton's ribald renegade bio-exorcist plays like a deceased stand-up comedian.  I couldn't tell which parts of Keaton's schtick was scripted or improvised.  This also the film that heralded Winona Ryder as a talent to be reckoned with and hopefully soon again.  An unqualified success.</p></body></html>

I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when the film's premise was pitched.  Ex-CIA operative trying to rescue his comely teenage daughter in Paris after she's kidnapped by an Albabian white slavery ring.  Probably the honchoes listening to the spiel were sold at mid-sentence.  What makes the film palatable is the prescence of Liam Neeson.  Neeson does his "Schindler's List" best to elevate this project above it's pulp roots.  Neeson and the film's makers keep you in their grip from start to finish.  After it's over though you realize that what you've seen is preposterous.  Don't tax your brain cells too hard and enjoy the thrill ride.</p></body></html>

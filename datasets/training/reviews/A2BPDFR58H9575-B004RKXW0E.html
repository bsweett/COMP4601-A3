<meta name="summary" content="Emotional and imaginative"></head><body><p>Emotional and imaginative -that's how the final entry in the enormously popular Toys  trilogy is described in Netflix, and I can't agree more. Who would have thought that one of the very best and most exciting films of the 2010 in the genres action adventure / thriller perfectly and brilliantly mixed with the comedy and touching drama would unfold in the playroom of the regular Anywhere, US suburban kindergarten. Who would have imagined that the bravest, most resourceful, loving, loyal, and lovable  heroes of this adventure will be plastic and metal toys?<br /><br />How often does it happen that not even the first but the second sequel in the popular series will surpass two excellent predecessors on all counts and become a rare film, that would make  even the most ironic and sarcastic male critics who could tear any movie to pieces with their harsh criticism  shed a tear and not be shy to admit it?<br /><br />A very smart person said once: "You need to write for  children like you would for adults,  but even better." Toy Story, Part 3 is  Toy Story, Part 3 is drawn,  programmed, staged, CGIed  and acted  with such brilliance, talent and joy that every viewer, regardless of age becomes a child and is immersed in an extraordinary world of adventure, where one for all and all for one.  By the end of this adventure, the viewers are  left with very special and touching emotions, and realize that they experienced one of the most beautiful and realistic movies about growing up, moving on, and saying goodbye.<br /><br />Bravo Disney, bravo Pixar, bravo American cinema!</p></body></html>

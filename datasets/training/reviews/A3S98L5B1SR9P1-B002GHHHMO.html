<meta name="summary" content="Exorcist"></head><body><p>The Exorcist succeeds on every level. This film should have swept the Oscars. The acting, and direction was beyond top rate, William Freidkin coaxed masterful performances from all of his actors. It works because we believe in Regan and her actress mom, they are real people like us, as is Father Karras and everyone else involved. We are seeing ourselves on the big screen. What happens to these people is the most terrifying thing that can happen to anyone, especially parents. What do you do when your kid is losing her sanity? You start to question yours as your world slowly falls apart, and no one can help, especially not doctors and head shrinks. But demonic possession? Is it real? Who really knows. But Regan's mother is desperate for any solution. And then the film begins to terrorize, to turn into the darkest nightmares. This film chilled audiences in the 70's to the bone, and I can see why. Freidkin uses subliminal images, and horrifying make up to tell a tale of demonic possession that strikes a raw nerve. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

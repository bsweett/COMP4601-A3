How many near-nudity/underwear shots were there?  About 3, weren't there?  Anything more would have been bordering on gratuitous...point made.<br /><br />To summarize briefly, most of the actors in this movie are standing around as if to say, "Ok, Mr. Director, what do I do now?"  "Something weird just happened...what do I do now?"<br /><br />Unfortunately, the plot contrivances are ploddingly predictable from the Thing's frustrations to where the internal conflicts within the group penultimately lead as well as Doom's demise (or merely defeat?  muhahahahahaha!!!).<br /><br />I'm not looking forward to any adventuring with the 4 if the same directing/screenplay talent is employed.  I only give it an additional star for the effects and the Thing's performance, despite the surreality of his surroundings.</p></body></html>

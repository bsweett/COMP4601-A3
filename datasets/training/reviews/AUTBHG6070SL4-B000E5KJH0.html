<meta name="summary" content="Rumor can keep it"></head><body><p>A non-stop flight across country presents at least one big problem for the airlines: keeping the passengers reasonably happy and reasonably inert. Mass sedation is attractive but has other problems, and sometimes it's too early in the day for alcohol. The airlines' solution is to show movies like "Rumor Has It." It's amusing enough, safe enough for a cabin full of people with widely varying sensitivities, and 100% guaranteed not cause excitement of any kind. And it's available without a prescription.<br /><br />The premise is goofy, in a chick-flick kind of way. Sarah (Aniston), Katharine (Shirley MacLaine, and "don't call me grandma") and the family get together for the wedding of Sarah's neurotic sister. Somehow, Sarah digs into enough of the family girl-gossip to discover that Katharine was the original Mrs. Robinson, the one in the movie "The Graduate." She also comes to think (and hope) that the man who bedded both her grandmother and mother might be her biological father - and thus begins the quest.<br /><br />She of course finds him: Beau Burroughs (Costner). And finds him attractive, as did the two generations of women before her. And beds him, as did her mother and don't-call-me-grandmother. By screwing him, she also screws up her own relationship. After some inept running around, everyone ends up back where they belong, in a forgettably happy ending.<br /><br />There are a few amusing moments in the banter, including:<br />-- "Does every girl in my family have to go to bed with you?"<br />-- "They don't have to, they just do."<br />Aniston also delivers a bit of physical comedy that was almost enough to rouse a real laugh out of my torpid mind. (Don't worry, you'll recognize it when it comes.) Mostly, though, it's a two hour movie built around a ten minute joke. The almost-incestuous side of Sarah's affair with Beau creates some amount of tension, defused safely through humor and atoned for by Sarah's eventual contrition.<br /><br />On the whole, this movie delivers the three Ss that it was selected for: it's safe, silly, and sedative.<br /><br />--wiredweird</p></body></html>

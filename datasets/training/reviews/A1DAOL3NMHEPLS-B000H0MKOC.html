<meta name="summary" content="Has its moments, but fails to realize its potential"></head><body><p>"Thank You for Smoking" is a mixed bag, mixing sharp observations about the American Political System with occasional droll humor... but it fails to realize its full potential for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />First and foremost, it is ambivalent as to whether the lead character, Nick Naylor, is a hero or a villain.  Personally, I liked a lot of what he had to say about freedom of choice, but the way it was presented, it seemed that the movie was mocking those sentiments. Of course, the liberal do-gooders also get their fair share of mocking, but ultimately the movie lacks a point of view.<br /><br />Second, I found it odd that although a crucial plot development centers on the fact that Nick would have to be a fairly heavy smoker to survive one particular event, he is never shown actually smoking. In fact, hardly anybody smokes throughout the entire movie, including all the tobacco industry people.<br /><br />Also, although I have no problem with profanity or "bad language" when it serves a real purpose, I thought they used the "f" word far too often in this movie, when it didn't serve a purpose.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this movie, but not as much as I thought I would. I'd give it 3.5 stars if that were an option; I'm going with 3 to bring the average down from its current 4-star level.  (I thought the funniest moment was in one of the deleted scenes, where the tobacco guys are considering various versions of a skull-and-crossbones logo. They should have left this in the movie!)</p></body></html>

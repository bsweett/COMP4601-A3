He doesn't want to be where he is at all and doesn't like the people he is with. This single day becomes a prison for him from which there is no escape. He trys everything including suicide but everyday begins the same with him waking up in bed in a Bed and Breakfast to the same awful Sonny and Cher song "I Got You Babe" on the radio. Perhaps he is dead and in hell. Eventually after who knows how many repeats of this of this seeming glitch in spacetime he comes to accept his fate. He seizes the day, learns new skills, undergoes a personality change, and becomes the most totally engaged, positive and plugged in person to a point that is beyond belief superhuman. All this effort centers around hooking up with a lovely lady who he traveled into town with (What else but romantic love with change a western man trapped in a Hollywood plot). She of course remembers not a single thing each new day (I wonder what twisted notions could have gone through his mind). He in the end wins her heart and finding love with her is what ultimately frees him and he finally is allowed to begin a new day, the day after Groundhog Day. But now he loves the town and wants to stay there forever. He has changed and found true happiness and the very same place and people that were his personal hell are now his heaven. In the real world time stops for no man and you don't get countless repeats to get it right but who doesn't feel like they've had their share of Groundhog Days--just in the sense of being trapped having to deal with the same stuff day after day after day?? That's why the movie strikes a cord. And he self-improves, becomes a super friendly overachiever and gets the babe and Tony Robinson couldn't have outdone this fable.<br /><br />GROUNDHOG DAY is a unique movie, well written and directed, well cast, and Bill Murray gave a pitch perfect performance. The only way to avoid real life Groundhog Days is to live a lot more even while not having a lot of time; but don't worry about perfection or think it is romantic love that will save you..... that's TOO Hollywood.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Moving Bio-Pic about Johnny Cash and June Carter"></head><body><p>Two superb performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon make the bio-pic of Johnny Cash `Walk the Line' a highly engaging and absorbing drama about him and his love June Carter. Without two leads, the film might have become a shallow melodrama about music and love that you have seen on screen many times before. As it is, in spite of the weak supporting roles and several mistakes that betray the not-so-sure hand of the director James Mangold (`Girl, Interrupted'), 'Walk the Line' is a moving story about Johnny Cash and June Carter.<br /><br />Though the film is full of great Johnny Cash songs, `Walk the Line' is more about the long-time romance of a gifted musician, and like any romance with gifted musician, it is full of romance and emotional turmoil. The film begins with the tragic event that happened in the childhood of the artist (like `Ray'), but the real film starts when we meet Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, whose less restrained and moralistic attitude to life than that of his wife inevitably attract Johnny Cash.<br /><br />Johnny Cash songs sometimes reveal the troubled soul of sinner or criminal with the darkly engaging lyrics. Credible acting from Joaquin Phoenix and several episodes depicted in the film explain the reason for this darker nature of his songs, but still many things are left out. While his distant father (Robert Patrick) convincingly shows the reason for the guilt-ridden mind seen in his songs and himself, supporting characters like his mother, his first wife, and his children are relegated to near ciphers. Still the strong performance from Reese Witherspoon compensates for the occasional slack in the script.<br /><br />As a fan of oldies, it is good to see the legendary artists of Sun Label such as Jerry Lee Lewis or Roy Orbison again even though they are played by someone else. The director somehow thought that to cast real singers are a better idea than to cast actors, and we see Waylon Malloy Payne and Jonathan Rice as Lewis and Orbison. I know this is only a small flaw, but I wish for my favorite musicians' roles someone who really looks like them.<br /><br />But essentially `Walk the Line' is a film for Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, both perfectly in character as Johnny and June. It is hard not to be moved by the conclusion and the energetic soundtrack of Johnny Cash numbers with thumping guitar riff.</p></body></html>

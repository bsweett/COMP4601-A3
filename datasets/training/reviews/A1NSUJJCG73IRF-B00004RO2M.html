<meta name="summary" content="Full Metal Jacket  (1987)"></head><body><p>Director:  Stanley Kubrick<br /><br />Cast:  Matthew Modine, Adam Baldwin, Vincent D'Onofrio, R. Lee Ermey, Dorian Harewood, Kevyn Major Howard, Arliss Howard, Ed O'Ross, John Terry.<br /><br />Running Time:  116 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for extreme violence and extreme language.<br /><br />The training of war ends up being a darkly humorous adventure for the men going into the Vietnam War. A crazed drill sergeant (R. Lee Ermey) puts his men through hell on Earth. The Tet Offensive becomes a story of its own. Men develop dehumanized personalities and others lose their minds. Turmoil prevails. Gallows humor and war violence erupts on the big screen. This is "Full Metal Jacket," raw, hard, and one of the best war movies made in the last quarter century.  One of Stanley Kubrick's best, "Full Metal Jacket" is a unique take on the Vietnam War, and while it isn't the best war movie out there, it is certainly amazing: Breathtaking cinematography is one of the film's strongest aspects, and a fantastic performance by R. Lee Ermey pulls the movie into a kind of interesting feel, where the strengths of the production are so vibrant and memorable that you start to forget about time and just appreciate the movie for what it is.  A whole line of young men play the different soldiers in the film, and while none come even close to matching Ermey's performance, they are all fantastic in their own right. A stunning amount of dedication and energy is present in "Jacket," making for an unconventional and humorous take on one of the world's weirdest wars.<br /><br />The first half of the film, dealing with the training of these raw soldiers, is hilarious and frightening. Ermey's crazed Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is one of the funniest characters ever put on film, and all of his lines are hysterical and impressively effective. Dark humor triumphs in the first half like war movies very rarely achieve, and this is part of what makes "Jacket" such a unique and wonderful movie. The second half calms down a bit, which is ironic because this is the half of the film where the combat takes place: This is the half with the Tet Offensive, and it's a disturbing, sobering and breathtaking piece of cinema. Truly excellent acting comes into play here, as do important political messages and a round of unique character development that takes it a step further from what the first half left us with. Though not as funny or entertaining as the first half of the movie, it is still a glorious piece of cinema, and it looks tremendous even by today's standards.<br /><br />This is one of Kubrick's most entertaining efforts, and not quite as polarizing as "2001: A Space Odyssey" or "A Clockwork Orange." Instead, it uses different film-making techniques to define itself, and its purpose is very, very clear: All the traditional messages of war movies are here (That wars are contradictory and often silly), and a lot of fascinating scenes can be found as well.  All the characters have a grounded "real world" feel to them, due to both the material and the versatility of the actors. R. Lee Emery is viciously delightful as the manic Sergeant Hartman, while managing to add occasional touches of humanity and a `this is for your own good' attitude through subtle gestures. Matthew Modine is the amiable lead, Private Joker, and as such balances the hard and soft edges admirably (if not spectacularly). The other stand out though is Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Gomer Pyle, the recruit picked upon by Hartman and the other cadets. There's a wonderful innocence about him in the beginning, which transforms into a frightening hardening of his soul later on. The evil, beyond-hope look he gives later on remains as the most frightening looks ever seen depicted onscreen.  A haunting, humorous, and often horrendously difficult film; however, it sparkles in its own way despite its flaws and sadism.</p></body></html>

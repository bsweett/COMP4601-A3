I mean when the vampire band say "F this place" and just blow up has to be one of the dumbest things I seen in a movie. The movie still makes for an entertaining blood bath though. The performances by Harvey Keitel and George Clooney help make the movie watchable as well. Although the movie starts off like a Pulp Fiction style film in the first half it becomes Evil Dead with vampires in the second half. I mean George Clooney is pretty much like Ash (Evil Dead) and the vampires seem more like the demons in the Evil Dead movies than vampires.  Although the script is all over the place  Robert Rodriguez still manages to make it sexy and fun and it's still one of his better films.</p></body></html>

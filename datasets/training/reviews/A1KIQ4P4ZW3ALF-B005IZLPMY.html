<meta name="summary" content="Sometimes Creative, Sometimes No"></head><body><p>First, read the IMDB page long list of goofs (I know there's even more!). Very entertaining and informative.<br />Negatives:<br />Some background on the energy source would have made the story more coherent.<br />More of an explanation as to how all the  high tech gadgetry came about. A cop out to comic book fans who don't like to think while being entertained.<br />A more developed plot sequence on how the various HYDRA labs were to be attacked rather than just show up out of nowhere and start firing away. Again bowing to a certain comic book audience demographic.<br />Roles and acting such as Jones' character shows he tediously stuck in an actor's rut. Usual token roles again for Asians and blacks and the overdone female role portrayed by Atwell as romantic interest and tough girl just seemed tossed into the plot to satisfy both the male comic book audience and to widen the demographic viewer profile all for remunerative reasons.<br />Positives:<br />Evans portrayal of the Cap was good, but I'm not sure which body was his and which was morphed in.<br />Fairly good quality and not yet overly overboard dominance in the use of CGI - just enough to create a good fantasy atmosphere. They did seem to borrow props and scenes from The Thing and Sky Captain ... amongst others.<br />The story tie in with WWII was integrated with appropriate humor and where appropriate, seriousness. Even though there's boxes of old comics to draw from I think the script people did a good job although less of a comic book feel would have helped the movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bullets to the head a deep statement for director"></head><body><p>Once you get past the obvious crime of remaking the Carpenter cult classic, itself a takeoff of Rio Bravo, you can while away two hours here with handsome production and a lot of people getting shot in the head.<br /><br />It's not terrible, by any means.  First, recognize that every single film you love will eventually get remade.  Hollywood has been doing it from the beginning.<br /><br />In this updated, updated Western, it's New Year's Eve and a decrepit Detroit police station is about to shut its doors for good.  There are a couple of cops, a secretary, and a lot of dust and antiques left.  No computers, the phone lines are down, and a raging blizzard outside.  All is well as the few folks left inside drink and celebrate.<br /><br />The just-arrested kingpin of Detroit, Bishop (Laurence Fishburne) is being transported to jail on this very night, and with the roads a total mess, the bus is forced to stop at Precinct 13 for the night and store its human payload in the ancient, Hannibal Lecter-esque cells.  Bad news for everyone inside.<br /><br />Turns out that Bishop has many a dirty cop on his payroll, and recently whacked a cop who tried to shake him down.  So now an army of cops, headed by Gabriel Byrne, decide to assault the police station and take out Bishop and everybody else inside.<br /><br />What follows is a lot of shooting, explosions, human drama, etc, etc.  There isn't much logic, and the absurdity keeps escalating until the finale, which takes place in the woods, which appear to be right down the road from downtown Detroit.  I don't know Detroit, but I really, really doubt there are thick woods right near the rotting industrial area near downtown.  I'm just guessing.<br /><br />Anyway, the whole thing becomes truly amazing.  Byrne and his crew, and there has to be like 30 of them, manage to commandeer SUVs, body armor, sniper rifles with scopes, automatic weapons with silencers and cartridge-catchers, stun grenades, night vision goggles, and what amounts to the most high-tech gear, including a helicoptor(!), and yet, yes, I will spoil it, they have amazing difficulty taking a falling-down police station staffed by a handful of people with 1/50 of the firepower.  It doesn't make any sense.  Attack after attack is repelled as our heavily armed dirty cops, who presumably all told their wives they had to 'work' on New Year's Eve, bumble their way around.  Sure, they manage a few cool tricks, and they kill their share, but seriously, this operation should have taken about 10 seconds of breaking down the front door and blowing everyone away in a hail of automatic fire.  Instead, Byrne and Co set up shop for HOURs, with nobody noticing.  Blizzard, sure, but even in the worst part of Detroit, something tells me somebody would notice a commando squad seiging a building.  Oh, and everyone's favorite modern-day technology, the mighty cell phone, is conveniently neutralized as someone is 'jamming the frequencies', a line thrown out there and just accepted.  Not only are these cops packing more gear than the Delta Force, they're jamming cell phones, cutting power, calling air support.  Seriously, this is the most incompetent bunch of over-equipped lackies since the Imperial Storm Troopers all poured through that hole in the wall at once in the original Star Wars.<br /><br />The movie has plenty of violence, people getting shot, a good beating, a random samurai sword, molotov cocktail action, gratuitous guy on fire, a whole bunch of people getting shot in the head and some really pointless shots of the brain-hole bleeding that must have really meant something to our Frenchman director, a doublecross, a lot of CGI snow that, at one point, isn't falling from the sky at all but just swirling around in the air like a snow-globe, and Ethan Hawke giving it his all as a troubled, alcoholic, pill-popping, skinny cop.<br /><br />It's watchable, there's enough action, your usual character scenes before said characters get bullets in their respective heads, blah blah blah.  In the end, the true accomplishment is the ability to take $40 million or however much this thing cost, and completely miss what Carpenter was doing with $100 back in 1976.  That's the magic of Hollywood--to remake an old idea with 200 times the budget and make better-filmed, more advanced, more expensive crap, and craft a master hack career in the meantime.  With this and The Fog appearing in 2005, it's truly only a matter of time before somebody comes out with their 'vision' for a Halloween remake, or more likely, an Escape From New York remake.  With more bullets to the head.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Epic"></head><body><p>I can tell by reading the reviews on this site that this movie is a love it or hate it thing; Some people found all the dialog and set-up boring, the subtitles a pain in the butt to read, and there was not enough action in this 2 1/2 hour epic film.<br /><br />I, however, thought otherwise. In fact, I would even say that this is Tarantino's best and most mature film despite the premise of 'killing Nazis'. I think many people thought that this was going to be the main premise of the movie, just slaughtering German's left and right. In fact, I do think that the ad campaign for this movie was a little misleading in that respect.<br /><br />This film is all about the dialog, the settings, and waiting for the outcome you know is coming. A great ensemble cast and the use of subtitles only add to the realism, and there is no shortage of either the trademark Quentin humor or sudden bursts of unexpected violence.<br /><br />For those expecting another Kill Bill, they will be sorely disappointed. But for those who are looking for smart, intense, well-acted WW2 drama w/a few unexpected surprises, this is the film for you. It is one of remarkable depth, and it is almost hard to believe Tarantino made it....in a good way.  A thick, rewarding film. Beautifully filmed, too.  The images on blu-ray really come to life; the theater just did not do this movie justice in terms of the visuals.<br /><br />I have watched this 6 times already, and I am sure I will watching it again soon. But that's me.</p></body></html>

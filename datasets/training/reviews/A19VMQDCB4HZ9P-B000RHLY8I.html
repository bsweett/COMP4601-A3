Niccol takes a serio-comic look at the machinations of the necessary evil that are freelance international arms dealers. This subject has been done before but with disastrous results with the Chevy Chase and Gregory White comedy vehicle, Deal of the Century. Niccol's film is much better due to its subject matter having more resonance in this era of post-Cold War and post-9/11. It also is inherently better due to another fine performance out of Nicholas Cage who has to have cornered the market on deadpan delivery of dialogue that has full comedic timing and at the same time fills a scene with dramatic weight.<br /><br />Lord of War is the story of one Yuri Orlov. A Ukrainian-born American who grows up in what he calls a different type of hell from communist USSR: Brighton Beach, USA. The film encompasses' Yuri's lowly beginnings as an amateur arms dealer selling to the Ukrainian mob enforcers in his neighborhood. Yuri is a quick learner and soon convinces his younger brother Vitaly (played by Jared Leto) to be his right-hand man. He needs someone to watch his back during his negotiations and sales and sees his brother as the best man for the job. Most of the film is told through as a flashback as Yuri narrates observations he'd made throughout his career as an international arms dealer willing to straddle the line between legal and illegal. In fact, he becomes so good at evading authorities that he soons goes from an amateur being dismissed by the Old Guard arms dealers (one played as an almost conscience to Yuri's amoral ways by Sir Ian Holm)to one who adapts fastest to the new world order of small conflicts that erupts as a consequence to the end of the Cold War. It is during these turbulent times that Yuri develops a business and almost symbiotic relationship with a Liberian warlord named Andres Baptiste, Sr (a chilling and stand out performance by Eamonn Walker) and his even more psychotic son Andres, Jr.<br /><br />We see Yuri from his lowyly beginnings to the height of his power as an elite in the shadowy world of secondary arms dealing. This is even made more pointed when his best customer, warlord Andres Baptiste points out that his people and enemies call him the lord of war, but he believes Yuri deserves that title even more. Yuri is the Lord of War as he sells to both sides in a conflict and tries to justify his amoral business practices by proclaiming that if he didn't sell them the weapons then a dozen others will. Even as he keeps an emotional detachment from the suffering and destruction his practices has wrought worldwide, especially in war-torn West Africa, Yuri's life is complicated even more by the dogged efforts of Interpol agent Jack Valentine (played with boy-scout righteousness by Ethan Hawke) who has made busting Yuri his goal in life. Add Vitaly who has become addicted to cocaine in no small part to his participation in Yuri's business dealings and a trophy wife in Ava Fontaine (played by Bridget Moynahan in a thankless role) all goes to make Yuri's personal and business life another hell he has put himself into.<br /><br />Yuri as a character would've become too much of a caricature if not for the deadpan performance by Nicholas Cage. Cage infuses the character with an almost resigned personality. A permanent ennui at having witnessed atrocities he himself might have caused with his arms dealing, but at the same time know that this is the only thing he's really best at. Cage has lived off playing such characters and even brings back glimpses of a similar but more powerful performance he had in Leaving Las Vegas. Both the character in that film and in Niccol's work have a resigned attitude about how their life has been, but where one gives in to his ennui and becomes suicidal, the Yuri character cannot stop doing what he does even if it meant losing everything he loved and being left disowned and alone.<br /><br />The film is very blunt about the evil that is the international arms trade, but Niccol and his writers have also pointed out that it is an evil that could be stopped if not for the major governments who have used these individuals as a necessary evil to push their strategic and political agenda for the rest of the world. Lord of War doesn't condemn arms dealers like Yuri Orlov. What it does condemn is the political atmosphere and machinations behind the global scene that makes such people necessary. Even though Orlov is not a true person he does seem based off the actual life and events of one Victor Bout whose life and career as an arms dealer mirrors that of Yuri's.<br /><br />Niccol's Lord of War is not a perfect film, but it is very timely in this new age of a world become more complicated with the end of the Cold War with terrorists, warlords and atrocities committed by the poorests of nations and its people. The heavy-handed message told through the film is saved by the excellent work by Nicholas Cage as the title character with great support from Eamonn Walker as Liberian Warlord Baptiste. Lord of War may not be perfect but its thoughtprovoking and to a certain extent very entertaining.</p></body></html>

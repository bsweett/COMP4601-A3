<meta name="summary" content="Casino - Even Better Second Time"></head><body><p>Seeing it on DVD with subtitles was almost like seeing a new movie - one that I understood a lot better.  Seeing it for the second time also helped.  The first time (15 years ago at the theatre) I was too busy being shocked by the incredible violence of the film (i.e. Joe Pesci).  I didn't understand why Pesci seemed more powerful than DeNiro.  Second time I got it - Pesci's character is a 'made guy'.  DeNiro's is not.  Perhaps all those Sopranos episodes between now and the last time I saw this film tuned me into things I didn't pick up on the first time.<br /><br />I liked it the first time I saw it though not understanding why DeNiro's character let Pesci's run the show had bothered me.  The violence bothered me.  The second time, I was (a bit more) prepared for the violence and had time to notice other things - like DeNiro's character and some of the mistakes he made along the way - he wouldn't give in on little things - money issues perhaps.  These things cost him a lot more in the long run.  Take for example not letting the hick relative of a powerful politician stay on the job.  And not allowing his wife to get away with giving her ex-lover the $25,000 she seemed so bent on giving him.  Even when she returns to him he cannot let sleeping dogs lie and instead has to find out exactly how she used the 25,000 until their relationship has once again disintegrated.  While Pesci's character is wildly out of control and the  most obvious cause of what brings them down, Rosenthal's own quiet stubbornesses have enormous consequence in what later goes down as well.<br /><br />I found this movie relentlessly fascinating/horrifying and hardly noticed it was 3 hours.  To say Casino is not as fast paced or gripping as Scorsese's earlier gangster pictures (Mean Streets and GoodFellas) is just a joke.  Mean Streets is nowhere near as fast-paced (or gripping) as Casino and while Good Fellas is considered Scorceses mob masterpiece I'd venture to say Casino is roughly in the same ballpark in terms of greatness (and certainly fast-paced intensity).<br /><br />In terms of DVD special features, the Anniversary edition (anamorphic widescreen 2.35:1) is double-sided with the movie on side A, and bonus features on side B including:<br /><br />*Deleted scenes,<br /><br />*"Casino: The Story" - how Scorcese collaborated with writer Pileggi,<br /><br />*"Casino: The Cast and Characters" - a look at the real people behind the characters and how the filmmakers cast them,<br /><br />*"Moments with Scorsese, Stone, Pileggi and more!",<br /><br />*"Vegas and the Mob",<br /><br />*"True Crime Authors: Casino with Nicholas Pileggi"<br /><br />This is a fairly jam-packed single dvd for special features and well worth the 4 or so bucks it's going for on Amazon.  I think I enjoyed it more on DVD than I did at the movies.</p></body></html>

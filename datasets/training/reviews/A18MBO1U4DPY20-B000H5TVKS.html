<meta name="summary" content="MISSING A GEAR (no spoilers)"></head><body><p>After watching the epic called SAW, I was a bit over enthusiastic because of how immensely interesting the film is. Jigsaw soon became one of my favourite & most interesting villains of all time. I like the masks and characters used to define the startling fear of Jigsaw used in SAW. I expected something more than what I got from SAW2.<br /><br />Saw 2 is better than your average film and I would rate it four stars had I not seen Saw. I expected more from this film than a film full of commercial intent. Yes,friends, there is a lot of blood in this film but what the film lacks is that fear Saw got out of me(viewer). Saw2 is mostly loud yet unpenetrating. It's like a freakshow where a lot of characters are put into one sequence. It is sad to observe that the director couldnt overcome the FAILING SEQUEL SYNDROME the film industry is blessed with.<br /><br />Although I'm terrible at pinpointing flaws and guessing the suspense, Saw II is predictable enough for me to have guessed the twist in the end. A review on imdb.com said the twist in the end is even more ingenious than Saw. I strongly disagree.<br /><br />Saw2 is a mixed bag because of how confused the direction seems. The pace of the story is slow from the start especially since many unknown characters are pooled in. I suggest you give the film a watch for yourself to understand how aimless the direction gets an hour into the movie.<br /><br />Please See, If you think Final Destination2 is a better film than its prequel , you will like Saw2.In 18 months time, Saw III will be released and I will make sure I watch it. The policeman(father) in the film played a rather lousy role but I blame the direction rather than the actor for it.<br /><br />Want to watch a violent film that will shake your faith? Watch  OLDBOY to see what flabbergasting suspense is all about.<br /><br />Luck.</p></body></html>

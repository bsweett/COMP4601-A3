<meta name="summary" content="3 AND A HALF....NOT 5 BECAUSE OF CARL EWLES"></head><body><p>Overall Saw was a decent movie I just wish that the lead role would have been given to someone else, Carl just couldn't get that emotion across for some reason and it took something away from the movie.<br /><br />The story and irony of of this film were great, it also had some pretty good gore along with some genuinly scary scenes,but,<br /><br />HOLLYWOOD-KEEP CARL EWLES OUT OF HORROR/THRILLER FILMS!!!!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An improvement over Apocalypse, but not as good as the original"></head><body><p>The t-virus has spread across the world, turning not only zombies into humans, but every animal species. Alice is leading a nomadic life, searching for the secret bolthole of the Umbrella Corporation. Together with a small band of survivors, she attempts to penetrate the bolthole, where stashes of the anti-virus are held. But inside Project Alice and Project Nemesis are there to stop them. A great improvement over Resident Evil Apocalypse, with a stronger plot and greater social commentary, but it still doesn't rise to the level of the original. Which is a shame; there are many facets that could have been explored further, such as the true reason the t-virus exists, and the humanity of the post-human creatures Umbrella has spawned. Still, it's an enjoyable installment in the Resident Evil series.</p></body></html>

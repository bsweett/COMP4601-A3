Silence of the Lambs was a great movie and Anthony Hopkins was great as Hannibal Lecter.  Red Dragon occurs before that story and we see a little of the crimes Hannibal committed as well as his capture, but little else.  Instead we are shown a ho-hum story about another serial killer played by Ralph Feinnes.  The story is not as suspensful and the killer is not as interesting as in Silence.  Also, while I like Ed Norton, he was a poor choice to play the FBI investigator-very bland and dull.  It was also tough to accept that this was before Silence since Anthony Hopkins looked older, fatter, and balder than in that movie.  With such a strong cast I had high hopes for this, but it was ultimately disappointing.  HD DVD picture quality was ok, but dark movies like this rarely look much better than the DVD-perhaps a bit sharper on my 106" screen.  Maybe worth renting if you like this genre, but definitely not worth buying.</p></body></html>

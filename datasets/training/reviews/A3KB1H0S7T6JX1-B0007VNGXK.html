<meta name="summary" content=""Salt collected from the tears of 1,000 angels""></head><body><p>A very pleasant surprise, Hellboy, brings to the screen exactly what the title implies: the story of a devil that crossed over from hell through an experiment conducted during WWII, and the life he lives hunting down monsters and protecting mankind!<br /><br />I have to admit that I did not know what to expect from the film, but as it turns out it was a very pleasant and entertaining movie.<br /><br />In short, the acting is above average, the special effects are excellent, and the plot is a pretty good one.<br /><br />There are slight hints of the X-Files, and strong/obvious elements of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Van Helsing and the X-Men, so the movie falls into the action/adventure/sci fi type of category.<br /><br />On the negative side can we not find something more original than the USUAL German/Nazi "bad guy" clich&eacute;, together with the USUAL crazy/deranged/dangerous Russian "boogieman" leading to the USUAL need to be rescued by the benevolent Americans?  Is that too much to ask?<br /><br />Moreover, Selma Blair playing "Liz" was not that wonderful.  The "misfit who doesn't belong" has way too many similarities with characters from the X-Men.<br /><br />In addition, it's too bad "Ilsa" had such a small role in the film; seems like she could be a rising star...<br /><br />In a nutshell, though not a masterpiece, Hellboy will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.  A movie definitely worth watching!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good kids movie"></head><body><p>This was a good kids movie, it didn't keep the attention of my 2 year old as much as other movies, but I really enjoyed the story and the humor of the movie.  I do think this movie is worthy of a sequel and may have the following similar to Sherk, so I think it is worthy of another storyline.</p></body></html>

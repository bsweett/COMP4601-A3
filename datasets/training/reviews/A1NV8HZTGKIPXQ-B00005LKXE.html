<meta name="summary" content="Hannibal Pleases, But Silence Is Still Golden"></head><body><p>Hannibal is one fine film. It didn't go over well with critics and some of the audience, but it is good. Sure, it is no match whatsoever for the brilliant Silence Of The Lambs, but it is a good film nonetheless. We all know the story, so need to go over it. Anthony Hopkins is electrifying. You just need to hear his &quot;Lecter&quot; voice and you get goosebumps. He is not over the top, which I've heard in reviews. He is perfect. Julianne Moore is no Jodie Foster, who would've been nice to have aboard, but she is quite adequate. She is very good. She has the right look and charm to her to make it work and to have people not miss Jodie Foster too terribly. Giancarlo Gianinni was also good. He had a strong presence that was a great addition to the film. Gary Oldman was good as usual. The final 20 minutes were surprising indeed. I was shocked at how Lecter went about as if it were a normal everyday thing. It was unsettling to the max!. The confrontation in the kitchen between Lecter and Clarice was rather good. Not as intense as the original, but still a good scene. I was only disappointed by Ray Liotta. He wasn't given enough to do. It seems he was just added just so there was another bad guy oon Lecter's list. Anyways, this was a fine film. It's not really eerie or suspenseful like Silence was,but that's okay. In fact, a lot of the recent slasher films had more suspense.But this film wasn't necessarily about that. It works well on it's own. Don't expect anything as good or memorable as Silence.</p></body></html>

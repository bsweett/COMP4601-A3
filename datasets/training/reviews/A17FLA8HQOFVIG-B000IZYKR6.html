<meta name="summary" content="Fascinating, but very uncomfortable to watch."></head><body><p>This 2005 independent film basically has two characters -- a mature 14-year old girl played by Ellen Page who meets a man through the internet and the man, played by Patrick Wilson, a 32-year old pedophile photographer.<br /><br />There's tension in the air from the beginning and this tension grows and grows as the girl becomes the tormentor and it's the man who the audience feels sorry for.  The acting was sensational although the screenplay was a little slow for my taste.  There are surprises throughout and twists and turns of the plot.  But the main emotions are the girl's cold calculated cruelty and the man's terror.  This is an uncomfortable film to watch but I was fascinated throughout.<br /><br />The film is well done, might even be a prize winner, and, on a certain level, I was fascinated by it even though I hated it.  Therefore, my recommendation is limited to film buffs only and those who not afraid of a film that will make you squirm.</p></body></html>

I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Fincher had put together a fascinating tale of determination / obsessive dedication in the face of mounting terror. ZODIAC starts off w/ a bang, showing us the maniac in action. The murders themselves are dealt with in quick succession, leaving the majority of the film to decyphering Zodiac's codes, gathering evidence, and interviewing suspects. I love police procedurals (Forensic Files is one of my favorite TV shows), so this movie held my interest throughout. However, ZODIAC is also about the effects of such a baffling, frustratingly drawn-out case on those who relentlessly pursue it. We watch as the characters' lives are nearly consumed by Zodiac to the point of their own ruin. Jake Gyllenhaal's cartoonist character goes from being interested in the case to being taken over by it. He will not rest or stop until Zodiac's identity is revealed. I could feel his obsession grow! Mark Ruffalo is the cop who runs down leads and ultimately gives up hope (almost) entirely. Watching these two is an amazing study in doggedness and dedication. These are the guys I want working on these types of cases! At the same time, we also get a look at the tremendous toll taken. The simple things in life that are missed. The price that is paid in mental / physical burn-out, lost opportunities, and personal relationships altered or destroyed. ZODIAC reminds us that life is precious, and that obsession, even well-placed obsession, will drain our souls. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves horror / thriller / mystery / real-life drama, as well as to those who love a great human story... P.S.- Robert Downey, jr. and Anthony Edwards are also excellent in their smaller roles...</p></body></html>

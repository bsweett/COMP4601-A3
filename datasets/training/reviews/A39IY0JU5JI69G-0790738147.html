I just picked it up in a hurry from the local library and stuck it in the DVD played for entertainment while I did a sink full of dishes.  At a few points I thought of stopping it but for some reason kept it running.  By the time I got to the pots and pans (I had a Lot of dishes) I was actually enjoying it.  Then, I sat down on the couch and started paying attention to it.  To my surprise, by the time the movie was finished I was wishing I had watched it more carefully from the top.<br /><br />Others here have written some great reviews, eg. that of Tom Benton, so I'm not going to bother to duplicate their efforts.  This is just to give encouragement to others who are not violence fans that they might actually like this, too.  What saves it, besides the exciting twists and turns in the plot, are the very well written characters.  The actors are superb in bringing these guys to life.  I disagree with those who complained about Kim Basinger's performance; I thought she was perfect for the role.<br /><br />For what it is, this is a very well made movie.  I certainly agree that it deserved an Oscar more than Titantic did.  I guess I'm with-holding one star, though, just on principle---it really did have an awful lot of blood and I have to wonder if it's a good thing to put these images into our minds. (spare me nasty comments, please! :-) )</p></body></html>

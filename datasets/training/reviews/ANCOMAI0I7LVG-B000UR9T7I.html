<meta name="summary" content="A complete freefall from greatness..."></head><body><p>The controversy sparked by my recent raving of a certain Batman movie has caused me to dig up this atrocity and give it another watch.  I had to borrow it from my Spider-Man obsessed brother-in-law for I do not own this movie (nor will I ever).  I think it's important, before I get into discussing why I loathe this movie as I do, to set you up with my feelings going in, so you won't label this a review by a disgruntled Spider-Man hater who expected to rip it apart walking in.  I am not `Team Batman' or something like that; for it is not that simple.  I am simple `Team Good Movie' and this just doesn't fall into that bracket for me.<br /><br />Oh, and MKIA, this is all for you ;-)<br /><br />So, to set things straight; and am a total Spider-Man fan.  Growing up he was my favorite superhero ever and I collected the comics and had all the trading cards and played with the action figures and so when the original `Spider-Man' movie was released I went insane with excitement.  While I felt it was a bit long in areas I totally loved the movie and saw it three times in the theater.  When `Spider-Man 2' was released I bought my tickets almost a week in advance and showed up at the theater an hour early and was blown away by how amazing the movie was.  It was smart and intense and brilliantly directed and acted.  It was the perfect superhero movie, and I still consider it one of the best superhero movies of all time; maybe even the best.  Last year there were a slew of trilogies ending, all of which I was excited over.  `Pirates of the Caribbean' was ending and `Shrek the Third' was being released and of course there was `Spider-Man 3' and of the three this was the one I was most excited over.<br /><br />It was going to be amazing.<br /><br />Since seeing this film I have come to affectionately refer to it as `Spider-Mess 3'.  Okay, so maybe not so affectionately, but whatever.  I will state this before getting into the film also.  I understand that Spider-Man is not a dark character, so don't for one second even begin to conclude that I don't `understand' this hero; I know him very well.  I also know that Venom is one of the darkest characters in the Marvel universe and that the whole symbiote storyline was Spider-Man's darkest hour.  Just know that I know that and you should too before watching this film.<br /><br />My main issue with `Spider-Mess 3' is that it is, well, messy.  There is so much going on that Sam Raimi fails to get a firm grasp on what he is trying to portray.  There are a slew of villains who all have their own agendas but their agendas are all thrown into one pot to stew; and on top of that you have Peter Parker's personal life, which is in shambles, and his relationships with not only Mary Jane and newcomer Gwen Stacy but also his best friend who now wants to kill him because he knows that he is Spider-Man and blames him for his fathers death.  The movie is barely over two-hours which seems like a lot of time, but it isn't if you want to do this story any real justice.  Instead, the film seems rather rushed and thrown together, especially in the ridiculous ending which made me so aggravated I wanted to get up and leave the movie altogether.<br /><br />Like I mentioned earlier, Spider-Man is not a dark character and that is what made the first two movies so delightfully entertaining.  Raimi understood how to take the stylized world of Spider-Man and make it deep and meaningful without making it dark and brooding.  I know that this is not Batman, who has always been a darker character (unless you include the mockeries that have been made of him in the past; i.e. `BAM' and `POW' and Joel Schumacher).  The problem is that Raimi, in this installment, made a mockery of `Spider-Man', ridiculously overplaying the `fun' aspect of the film and sacrificing the intelligence.  There is no balance here.  Stripping the character of all dignity he made the evil of the symbiote play more like a arrogant frat-boy than anything else, making it a joke.  If you take it for comic relief you can justify it, but it deserves no justification.  This was Raimi's chance to explore that dark side to the story, but he opted for the childish way out and failed miserably.<br /><br />Another major issue that I have with this film is the special effects.  `Spider-Man 2' especially was so rich with visuals that I felt walking out that it would never be topped.  It was stunning to watch, mostly because nothing looked like a video game.  It was high speed action from start to finish but it never looked corny or `fake'.  The opening sequence in `Spider-Mess 3' with Spider-Man fighting Harry Osborn through the ally is horrible.  It was so fake looking, like a really poorly made videogame.  My best friend looked at me and rolled his eyes and said "should he leave now?" and I wish that I had conceded right then and there.  Even the freefall scene where Spidy rescues Gwen Stacy is horrible animated.  They would have been better off making this a cartoon.  Sure, the imagery of the Sandman is impressive in parts, but the lazy way they went about the ridiculous ending with Sandman looking like Kirby was just aggravatingly bad.  I wanted to bang my head against a wall, but I was in the middle of the theater (always have to sit in the middle) and there was no wall within reach.<br /><br />It was just a mess; thus the name `Spider-Mess'.<br /><br />Thankfully Tobey Maguire (inspired casting if there ever was one) continued to make Peter Parker a three-dimensional character and breathe whatever life he could into this interesting failure.  Kirsten Dunst also continued with some nice character development, and Topher Grace is just wonderful here as Eddie Brock; although it is sad what they did with Venom, making him an afterthought and just discarding him like he wasn't important when he really should have had his own movie.  Thomas Haden Church is decent here, but the film never really gets under his skin.  He's just your token bad guy who is really not so bad.  James Franco is horrible, but he was horrible in the first two also.  People are raving him as an actor now that he was in `Milk' this year, but I have yet to see it so to me he is still a terrible actor.  Bryce Dallas Howard is underwhelming to say the least, but I didn't expect a whole lot.<br /><br />This should have been a great movie, but sadly it isn't even a good one.  It is mediocre at best, and at times that feels like generosity on my part.  Yes, I loathe this messy film; not just because it is just plain bad but also because it ruined what had the potential of being the best `trilogy' of all time.  The first two films built so much promise, but this debacle just threw it all away.<br /><br />I don't have the heart to give it an F so I'll settle for a D.  If it weren't for the acting I would be forced to give it an F, but you can thank Maguire and Dunst (and especially Grace) for that extra star.<br /><br />Will I see `Spider-Man 4' if there ever is one?  Yes.  Will I walk in expecting greatness?  Yes, since Raimi has a lot of atoning to do, and I think he knows it.  Will I be shocked if it turns out to be a nightmare?  Not after this I won't.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What if you were accused of a murder you hadn't committed yet??"></head><body><p>+++++<br /><br />This intelligent science fiction movie is based on the short story "The Minority Report" (1956) written by Philip K. Dick (1928 to 1982).<br /><br />In the mid-21ST century, murderers are caught before they actually commit the murder.  How is this achieved?  By harnessing the extraordinary power of mutant humans who have the ability of precognition (the perception of an event, murder in the movie's case, before it occurs.)  These mutant humans are called "precogs."<br /><br />The police force utilizes these precogs (there are three) by developing a "Precrime" unit.  This unit is headed by Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise) and the director of the unit is Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow).  The new system is working well until one day the precogs have a prevision that the Chief himself will commit a murder.  The rest of the movie is about the Chief running from the Precrime unit and trying to find proof of his innocence.<br /><br />Now that you know what the movie is about you might ask why it has such a strange title.  When the three precogs all agree on a prevision of murder, a "majority report" is generated.  If two precogs agree but one disagrees, then a "minority report" is generated.  (It is this minority report that the Chief is after to prove his innocence.)<br /><br />This movie was directed by Steven Spielberg and it shows.  He has taken a short story and effectively expanded it.<br /><br />The special effects showing this future world are fantastic.  However, Spielberg does not let these special effects dominate the movie.<br /><br />There is also good background music and in some scenes, classical music is even used.<br /><br />The acting is well done.  Cruise as the Chief effectively carries the movie while Max Von Sydow gives a good performance as the aging director.<br /><br />Some say that the ending of this movie is not very good.  I disagree.  It portrays what a reasonable, rational society would do.<br /><br />There is only one flaw that I detected in the story.  Once the Chief is declared a future murderer, he shouldn't have access to the Precrime unit's headquarters.  Yet he does!  (It should be noted that I discovered this flaw after the movie was over.  This flaw never occurred to me as I was viewing the movie because I was so absorbed in the story.)<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (single disc edition) is perfect with respect to picture and sound quality.  It has two extras, both of which I found interesting.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you like intelligent fast-paced science fiction mystery thrillers, then this is the movie for you!!<br /><br />**** 1/2<br /><br />(2002;  145 min;  widescreen;  24 scenes)<br /><br />+++++</p></body></html>

Fair Interpretation of a Classic!"></head><body><p>OK, listen to it.<br /><br />This movie should not be compared to the original 1951 version since much of its purpose and message is different.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />I don't think the negative reviews this film have been receiving are totally fair but at the same time there is much, much room for improvement.  But dammit, the US Army made up a name for the robot and it's an acronym: G.O.R.T.!  I could'a cried!!  But I digress:<br /><br />1928 India, we see a human in a snow storm, assume the Himalayas.  Hey, it's Klaatu.  Or at least  a man.  And this guy gets a piece of himself sucked into the sphere.<br /><br />We jump to 2008 (present day, that is) and here comes the panic.  Jennifer Connelly, terribly miscast, as Dr. Helen Benson, one of several scientists who find out that a space body is coming to the earth at incredible speed.<br /><br />Rather than impact the earth and turn it into powder, the sphere lands in Central Park.  And just like in the original, the military over-reacts and shoots the alien (Reeves).<br /><br />The military throughout this film is hell bent on destruction.<br /><br />The US government is hell bent on keeping everything a secret and creating a cover-up.<br /><br />Helen's boy, the little brat played by Will Smith's son, is very, very bad.  It is not made clear until near the end of the movie where this kid's hatred and insolence comes from.  He is like a microcosm for the planet's woes, really.  Or rather Mankind's attitudes.<br /><br />Kill, kill.  No, let's make a dialogue.  No.  let's kill anyway.  Must destroy.<br /><br />The specialists in the beginning are not played well into the film at all.  In fact, they disappear completely.  They were the voice of reason, then they were shut down in favor of military might.<br /><br />Good things:<br /><br />The escape from the military facility was good.  Klaatu pours on the power, takes a guy's suit and makes his move.<br /><br />The metal termite invasion:  Clouds of these things disintegrate all they touch, even humans.<br /><br />The spheres;  taking with them what life remains.<br /><br />Bad:  Gosh, where do I start?<br /><br />I have read critics' view of the film having an environmental message.  Not totally true.  Per Klaatu, there are only a handful of planets that support life.  Man is killing this planet.  It does not belong to Man, Man is the caretaker and he's doing a very poor job.<br /><br />In the original, Man was on the brink of nuclear holocaust.  Frankly, with more countries having the atom bomb today than in 1951, that may still be the case, but I digress.<br /><br />Also in the film, we see riots in the streets and destruction.  Man seems to be doing a pretty good job of wiping himself out without alien interference.<br /><br />Jacob, the kid, is such a prick.  Hard to feel any sympathy for the guy.<br /><br />Self-sacrifice and the motivation to survive in the midst of destruction, these were attempted to be played up and they did fairly well in putting this point across.<br /><br />But Jennifer Connelly, sorry.  "We can change, we can change!"  Klaatu:  "We've hoped you could."<br /><br />Why does the Secretary of Defense have so much power?  Why does she refuse to let Klaatu speak  before the U.N.?<br /><br />Interesting points:<br /><br />Alien spy among us, talks to Klaatu in Chinese at a McDonalds restaurant (wow, the commercial money for that must'a been great).  Alien spy has lived among us for 70 years and though he knows we are a violent destructive race, he loves us and would rather die with us than return to space.<br /><br />This theme of self-destruction and rising from it was a fair point.<br /><br />Just, darn it, not done well enough.  The ending fell flat for me.<br /><br />I felt the Earth was quite still at that point!<br /><br />Better to see:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600893163">The Day the Earth Stood Still & Other Sf Classics</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKFR">The Day the Earth Stood Still</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEWEDK">Forbidden Planet (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a></p></body></html>

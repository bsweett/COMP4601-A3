Could they be biting more than they can chew...<br /><br />There are hints of The Bone Collector and The Silence of the Lambs, so the movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller/horror type of category.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, Seven is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Matador"></head><body><p>Julian Noble (Brosnan) is a hitman who is burned out and trying to get out of the business.  In Mexico City, he meets Danny Wright (Kinnear), and makes a poor impression.  Determined to make up for it, he takes Danny to a bullfight the next day.  There, Julian confesses to Danny that he is a hitman, and tells Danny how to go about making a hit to convince him he  is telling the truth.  The two part ways, only to meet again months later when Julian shows up at Danny's house in Denver looking for help.<br /><br />That is a fairly simple description of a very funny movie.  Brosnan is doing his best to shed the James Bond image that he has cultivated over the last decade, and he succeeds.  Kinnear is the straight man, an average Joe., and is believeable in the role.  Danny and Julian's friendship is believeable, and that is what makes the movie work.  All in all, "The Matador" is an entertaining buddy film that has a lot of humor.  Fans of either of the stars will not be disappointed, and I recommend the film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Loved It!"></head><body><p>I went out one day on a whim and decided to see this when it was in the theatre and I loved it!  I don't often always see a lot of the animated movies in the theatre, but instead wait until dollar theatre or Netflix or something, but I had seen everything else at the theatre at the time I wanted to see and wound up seeing this.  Loved it!  It was among one of the better animated movies I had seen around that time, other than like Toy Story 3, and later Rango and Kung Fu Panda 2.  I bought this up on Blu-Ray right when it came out and have watched it several times since.  If you're at all into animated movies, this is definitely one to watch.  It's overall pretty good for kids, though there are a couple of parts that might be scary.  I'd say it's good for maybe ages 5+.  In any case though, this is a must see animated movie!  I highly recommend it!</p></body></html>

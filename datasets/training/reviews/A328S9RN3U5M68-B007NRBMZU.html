Marketed as a star turn for Ashton Kutcher, it is more a film that, despite its big budget and excessive special effects, should have played the small art theaters.  Well, now, in the solitude of the home, the film can be watched for what it really is - an interesting concept based on the Chaos Theory: one tiny event can have cosmic end effects. The title references this theory: the flutter of a butterfly wing can result in a chain of events that may end in a huge, destructive windstorm.  The writers and directors of this film use a rather sophisticated example of a young man haunted by past events he recorded in journals only to find he is able to 'relive' those series of bad events, change one thing, and alter the outcome of the initial deed.  It just happens that his blackouts/memory lapses/time travels don't always make things better and it is only a final act of change/contrition that he is able to put the bad histories to rest. Yes, it is a bit sci-fi in technique, but it also elicits participation from the viewer who must concentrate to walk the maze created by the victim/perpetrator/madman/savior. The cast is well chosen and Kutcher for the most part is able to overcome his history of pretty boy, inane previous roles to make Evan (the history-altering proponent of the Chaos Theory) credible - and that says a lot.  The others in the cast do well with some occasional rather dreary dreadful roles inherent in the story, and while one wishes the cinematography/special effects could have been more sophisticated, the mood of the film remains unbroken until the rather surprising ending (Director's Cut version).  In other words, what on the surface may seem a glitzy, silly movie is actually a thinking person's film.  Give it a chance.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Mafia in Detail"></head><body><p>Quite simply the best &quot;mobster/Mafia&quot; movie ever to hit the screens.  Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star in this movie of Italian family strife in the 1940s.  The old &quot;godfather&quot; of the Corleone family (Brando) is one of the U.S's biggest leaders of orginized crime families.  His war-returning son Michael (Pacino) has nothing to do with the family business.. at the moment.  He is drawn into a world of crime and strife after his father lays complete family control to his son.  Now, Michael must become the new &quot;Don&quot; of the family, leaving behind his old legit life, and becoming one of the most succesful Mafia leaders in history.  An excellent film of Italian-American life, as well as the dark-nature of the underground &quot;mob&quot; world.  Everyone should see this one.</p></body></html>

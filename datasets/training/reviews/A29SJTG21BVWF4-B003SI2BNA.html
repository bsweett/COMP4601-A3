<meta name="summary" content="Average Movie of the Day"></head><body><p>Like many "horror"/Thriller movies that have come out between 1996, i.e. "Scream",  and most of 2005 there hasn't been much to talk about for this genre, filled with many things that go bump in the night and cheesy plot lines.  "Dark Water" is hardly any different than that, with the execption of decent acting by Jennifer Connelly.  Much of the story line in "Dark Water"  is much like the story line you would find in movies like "The Ring" and "Sixth Sense".  A kid and their parents or a parent or adult figure who slowly begin the realize that there is a ghostly presence who is filled with anger and rage because of something that happened to the ghostly presence in life.  Been there, seen it more than once.  It has been getting old since "Sixth Sense" first came out.  Holloywood needs to find new material for horror films.  Because this movie is no more than an average rental during halloween, if that often.</p></body></html>

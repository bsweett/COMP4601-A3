<meta name="summary" content="Terminator 3: Fall of the Series?"></head><body><p>When it was announced that James Cameron would not direct TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES, fans and critics said "Hasta La Vista" to the film's success, both critically and commercially. Not having Cameron's visceral trademark M.O (Blow up everything) for the continuation of the series is criminal. But that's Hollywood for you. Now with Cameron only producing, Jonathan Mostow (Breakdown, U571) is set to helm this monster of a movie. With both star and budget problems and no Linda Hamilton, this could kill the franchise. Oh sure, it'll be impressive to see what it'll look like and Arnie's fans will no doubt get excited about the Austrian hulk's return to the series after a long string of action clunkers. New cast members include Kristanna Loken as the female terminator and Claire Danes. It's all speculation, but Cameron replaced by a shaky B-movie director, we can only hope that this will be a success that will terminate box office records and revive Schwarzenegger's career as one of the greatest action guys in movie history. And regardless of the film's problems, millions of hard-core fans are eagerly waiting for it's theatrical release in July 2 2003.</p></body></html>

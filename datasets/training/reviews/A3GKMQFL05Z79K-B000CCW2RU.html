<meta name="summary" content="The Island......"></head><body><p>First off, like alot of the movies I've reviewed on here, I picked this movie up in a bargain bin for cheap. What made me purchase it was the fact that this was a Michael Bay film(you know, the guy who directed the Transformers movies, for chirssakes). Reading the back of the DVD case, I figured this movie would be kinda boring so I put it down. Then, thank Heaven, I saw Scarlett Johannson's name on the cover. It was then that I decided the movie couldn't be all THAT bad(now could it?) with her in it so I bought it.<br /><br />The Island is about a private society where humans are cultivated for spare parts, surrogate parenthood, and full-body replacements for the wealthy. Yet, when two of the clones (Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johanssen) begin to question their existence and the motives of their keepers, they escape into the real world to find answers.  Sadly, though, their keepers are determined to see that they don't get away alive and that's when the real fun begins.<br /><br />I was completely blown away with the movie. For a mix of Sci-fi and Action, The Island more than delivers it in spades. It goes to show why Michael Bay is one of Hollywood's most talented directors(this side of Steven Spielberg). With every movie the man makes, the films continue to get better and better and better. That's what is important, a director needs to learn and continue to grow as a director. It's easy to see that this is one of Bay's best films, besides The Transformers and Armageddon. Ewan Mcgregor and Scarlett Johansson(who looks breathtaking in this film, I might add) deliver great performances as Lincoln 6 Echo and  Jordan 2 Delta.  The Island also stars Steve Buscemi, Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Sean Bean(a stellar cast, for sure).<br /><br />Sci-fi and Action fans take note, you're missing out on one great movie if you miss taking a trip to The Island.</p></body></html>

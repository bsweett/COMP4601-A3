<meta name="summary" content="Don Cheadle should have gotten an oscar for this"></head><body><p>This film is an absolute masterpiece that speaks about the true events that happened in Rwanda. This movie was very disturbing and I had to fight my tears for most of it. Cheadle gives a hands down absolutely brilliant performance and after seeing Ray, I would have given the oscar to Cheadle even though Foxx was good as well. The movie shows all that this man who owned a large hotel went through to save his people. The town is divided between the Hutu and Tootsies. Cheadle's character is a Hutu but his family and most of his friends are Tootsies. When certain Tootsies kill a Hutu general, the Hutu go after the Tootsies trying to kill all of them. They succeed in many ways in this horryifying story. But, Cheadle's character takes all the Tootsies he can find and hides them in his hotel. This movie shows the atrocities that really occured and also shows how barely any other countries did anything to intervene. It shows even worse the racism in which the governments that help save the whites but just leave the black(tootsies) for dead. This is nevertheless a masterpiece that depicts an atrocity.<br />Seeing this makes me realize how lucky I am to be in the comfort of my home while those poor people had to go through this. But, it also makes me feel very guilty that our government didn't give any sufficient aid in this situation.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE POSSIBILITY OF THE HUMAN RACE ON THE EXTINCION LIST!"></head><body><p>this film was great. it was deep, and had a lot to say. really makes you think, about the world and the population in general. petty things that don't matter compared to a fear of us being no more on this earth. another point made is that mother nature is above all science, and man here. very well written, the whole story was very interesting, and shows what one man with nothing to live for, would do for mankind. clive owen gives a brilliant performance. this put his name on the map, defenitly. well acted, nailed his character right on the mark. from an ordinary man to a hero in a day. julianne moore and michael caine played meaningful roles, both gave a huge sacrifice for the miracle of the world. this movie is very entertaining, shows how the world because of us has gone to hell, all hope is lost, when out of nowhere we get a second chance. brilliant idea, loved it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Lucy Looks Into A Wardrobe..."></head><body><p>This film was very eagerly awaited by many fans of the books, and fantasy fans in general. By and large, the film delivers the goods, although it teeters a bit here and there. Narnia, the magical land entered through the wardrobe, is stunningly rendered. The wonder of Narnia in winter as first glimpsed by Lucy is perfect. The White WItch is perfectly dreadful, as she was meant to be. The children, for the most part, are good as well, though a few wooden moments occur during the rather long running time. Happily, the creature effects are well-done, especially the lion, Aslan. He was the epitome of nobility and power. The battle scenes seemed just a bit sanitized, perhaps after seeing the epic battles of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, we need to be completely bowled over to be impressed anymore. Anyway, the religious element wasn't bashed over our heads, just presented as it was in the book, more symbolic than overt, which is as it was supposed to be. There were a few deviations from the book, which again is usual for a transfer to the big screen. Hollywood seems to think a book just isn't allright as it is, and must be "doctored" a bit for translation to film. Oh well. For the most part, the film is very happily very close to the book, and it succeeds as a film. Hopefully this means the others in the series will be as good themselves. The DVD transfer is beautiful, with excellent light and dark contrast, with bright glowing colors. The sound is great without being overbearing. I had very definite ideas in my head when I read the book as to the landscape, the characters, and especially Aslan. Thankfully, the powers that be who created this film had many of the same ideas.</p></body></html>

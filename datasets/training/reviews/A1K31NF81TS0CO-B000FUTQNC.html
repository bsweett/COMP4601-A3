<meta name="summary" content="Worst Harrison Ford movie I've ever seen..."></head><body><p>I was thoroughly disappointed with this movie. I viewed this movie as the DVD, borrowed from my online service.  I was so relieved to sign on and see I wasn't the only one who felt this way.  I will definitely refer to Amazon reviews before my future rentals.<br /><br />This movie reminded me so much of many of the Harrison Ford films of the past 10 years.  He is an executive, with a specialized knowledge, who gets caught up in a web of deceit and destruction.  Somehow he is made to look like the guilty party.  But in the end, justice prevails, and he is exonerated of all "crimes" committed.<br /><br />But there were LOTS of problems with this one!  LOTS of problems!<br /><br />TIRED PLOT<br />First of all, the plot was tired and clich&eacute;d.  Most of the movie, except for a short 20 minute segment I found myself completely bored!  I kept checking the time of the movie, thinking that it must be getting close to the 1 1/2 hour mark.  But it just dragged on and on.<br /><br />LOTS OF LOOSE ENDS<br />When I say loose ends, I'm not necessarily talking about unexplained or unfinished plot stories, but I'm talking about clich&eacute;d happenings, without any sort of resolution.<br /><br />Like (SPOILERS AHEAD)<br />1)The whole business about his credit being compromised: what was that all about?  First of all, no online Gambling service is gonna give you credit.  You use a credit card, and they charge you, simple as that.  It would have made more sense for his Credit card company to call him, about his non-paid credit card.  What if that thug from the gambling joint had shown up, and Harrison Ford's character had called in sick that day?  STUPID scene!!!  I found myself thinking about that illogical sequence, and it interfered with my enjoyment of the movie.  And it just got worse and worse!<br /><br />Why couldn't they have had an earlier (or later) scene that explained that interaction, to disclose to the audience, the director's point?  It meant nothing to me, and just interrupted my enjoyment.<br /><br />2) Firing of the staff at Harrison Ford's workplace.  Wouldn't it have been nice to find out the conclusion and explanation of them being fired?  It wasn't enough to see him come to the female secretary's apartment.  For help?  Why the hell would she be helping that lunatic now?  He had just fired her.  But the director could have made that segment more believable.<br /><br />3)The hoods keeping his family hostage was completely non-believable!  They looked like computer geeks, not hardened criminals.  I thought Robert Forester's roll was half baked and wasted!  Harrison Ford, himself, looked half asleep throughout the entire movie.  Was it filmed in real time?<br /><br />4) The ending was terrible!  I couldn't believe it when the credits started to roll.  Certainly there was some mistake!  What about all the people back at the office?  Maybe we could see him apologizing to the head of security  He had nearly run him over in the garage.  What about the bank manager at the airport?<br /><br />I could go on and on.  Suffice it to say, this movie stunk to high heaven!  I'm really glad I did not purchase it.<br /><br />Two thumbs down!  If you can borrow it free from a friend, do so, but don't pay for this tripe!<br /><br />MC White said: It stinks!</p></body></html>

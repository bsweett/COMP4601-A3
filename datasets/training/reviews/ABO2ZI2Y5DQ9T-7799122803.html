<meta name="summary" content="Alice in Underworld: Not Exactly Tim Burton's Best"></head><body><p>In Tim Burton-directed "Alice in Wonderland," the titular heroine re-visits (not just visits) the strange world where Cheshire Cat and Mad Hatter live. Though two original books of Lewis Carroll serve as the basis of the plot (newly written for the film by Linda Woolverton), Tim Burton's latest offering is about the journey and adventures of grown-up Alice (Mia Wasikowska), now 19 years old, who has almost completely forgotten the magical world, or "Underland," where she once travelled when she was much younger.<br /><br />This is the second time I was disappointed with Tim Burton's films (the first being "Planet of the Apes" - I love "Mars Attack" for its sheer ridiculousness). The change of the heroine's age is OK with me as long as the story is interesting. The generic plotline never gives her a chance to show what she can do, however, and I admit Mia Wasikowska is doing her best, Alice's character remains boring and lifeless.<br /><br />I am not saying there is nothing to be wondered at in "Alice in Wonderland." Though they lack in style, the pitch-perfect visuals are gorgeous to look at. Helena Bonham Carter's big-headed Red Queen is amusing to see, and so is Mad Hatter played by Johnny Depp in a delightfully tongue-in-cheek way. One regrettable thing is that these characters are trapped somewhere in the computer-graphic extravaganza and usual "Good vs Evil" dichotomy. I almost forgot to say that this is a Disney film.<br /><br />As in the book, "Curiouser and curiouser!" Alice says in Tim Burton's adaptation. My impression about the film is opposite. Alice's new journey looks derivative and uninspired, something I didn't expect from the director of "Edward Scissorhands."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""The Butterfly Effect" is well made!"></head><body><p>"The Butterfly Effect" is one of the best well made movies in recent history. Ashton Kutcher's performance as Evan Treborn, is emotionally convincing and powerfully strong. The rest of the cast are excellent. The directing by J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress is brilliant without compromise. The music by Michael Suby is brilliantly powerful without compromise. The cinematography by Matthew F. Leonetti is brilliant. The film editing by Peter Amundson is brilliant. The casting by Carmen Cuba is great. The production design by Douglas Higgins and the costume design by Carla Hetland is brilliant. The visual effects by Efilm is brilliant without compromise. This movie is well made down to its brilliant well made ending. Go see this movie right now, if you can.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not very entertaining, strange ending"></head><body><p>I did find Shutter Island to be a little entertaining but just really could not get into it.  The ending was really strange I thought and could have been better.  It is set like in old times 1950's, 60's etc and has that type of feel to it.  The movie almost reminded me of titanic a little, maybe because of it's that same older times feel or because L. DiCaprio was in it as well.  There is a lot of suspense, mystery and really never got board watching it yet for some reason just did not find it very interesting.  A better ending could have changed my opinion for sure.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></body></html>

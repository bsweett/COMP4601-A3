<meta name="summary" content="Unoriginal, mediocre thriller"></head><body><p>Unoriginal seems to be the predominant word that comes to mind when describing this movie, although the movie doesn't really "cop-out" until the latter part of the film. Beforehand, it does have its chilling moments, despite throwing in a clich&eacute; every now and then (the cat jumping out of a door, etc). And then the last part of the film the plot literally fizzles, and the thriller/horror movie formula is used.  It is then we decide we have seen this ploy done many times in movies before, and we may feel cheated as a moviegoer.<br /><br />How notorious is it for Hollywood to take a movie formula and use it repeatedly? Quite, apparently.<br /><br />Starring Dakota Fanning as Emily, Hide and Seek is about a girl who is traumatized after the apparent suicide of her mother. As Emily continues to be withdrawn after this incident, her father, played by Robert De Niro, decides to take her away from the city and start over away from the house and its memories. From there, Emily becomes obsessed with her imaginary friend "Charlie", and bizarre events begin to happen.<br /><br />What irked me most about this film was its logic, or lack thereof. Many of the characters just seem to fall into their convenient little places so the movie's plot will fit just right. For instance, you just know the worst thing the father can do is take Emily out into the country in a creepy old house and even creepier neighbors and sheriff to try to help them recover. (As a psychologist, you think he would know better).<br /><br />There are also inconsistencies and loose ends that are never explained, just left for one to ponder. For instance, what is with the neighbors who continually tell De Niro's character that his daughter is "beautiful?" Also, what is up with the man showing up at two o'clock in the morning to drop off a key to the house? The creepy sheriff apparently is just that: a creepy sheriff, and no more.<br /><br />Although this wasn't an awful movie, it is certainly won't be one remembered years down the line. Although this movie was scary at times, there are many other scary movies that will leave one feeling more satisfied.<br /><br />It's my suggestion that you rent this movie first, and judge for yourself, rather than racing out and buying it when it comes to DVD.</p></body></html>

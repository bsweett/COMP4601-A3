<meta name="summary" content="An Unexpected Surprise!!"></head><body><p>When you put this film in your DVD player, you know what you are in for. It's not directed by Spielberg, it's not written by Mamet, it's not distributed by Miramax . . . this is a fluffy film that was designed to be entertaining. Plain and simple. As a self-proclaimed film-snob (hey, it's my job!), I dislike the majority of mainstream tripe . . . but this I did not dislike; in fact, it was genuinely funny.<br /><br />People who have no exposure to NASCAR culture (I am forced to behold the massive influx of crazies to the Pocono 500 every year), may not understand why this film is so hysterical. Likewise, those who are obsessed with NASCAR may feel slighted (the film paints them as the simple-minded, uneducated, uncultured rednecks they most assuredly are). Anyone else will find enjoyment in this silly, excellently acted film.<br /><br />The jokes are non-stop and genuinely funny! The humor is blasphemous, grotesque, sometimes coarse . . . and all of that is hysterical!<br /><br />Many complain that this is not the Will Ferrell of Elf. Who cares?! An actor does not want to be typecast . . . especially as a "family-film" actor (YIKES!!). Let us not forget how he began his career . . . do you really think he desires to be a role-model for children? I think he is a bit more interesting than that.<br /><br />Like others have said, this film was not intended to "change the world" . . . it was meant to inject humor into our lives . . . and, in that, it certainly succeeds.</p></body></html>

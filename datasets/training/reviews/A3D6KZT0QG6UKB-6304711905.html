<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing"></head><body><p>After I struggled through Wyatt Earp, my friends all recommended this movie to me. Apparently Kurt Russel is a better actor than Kevin Costner and Val Kilmer's Doc Holiday is just amazing. So I finally watched it and it wasn't all that great.<p>Of course Doc Holliday is the best character in this storyline and he will always be the best character, but I found Dennis Quaid a better Doc Holiday (if only because he was saving us from Kevin Costner's delivery) Val Kilmer just seems pretentious where Dennis Quaid was having fun. Kurt Russel is ok, but this movie is also ponderous and too long. <p>Besides that the video transfer isn't very good. Half the time it looks like everyone is walking around in a dust cloud. While that brings some authenticity to the old west storyline it doesn't bring much pleasure to the viewer at home. If you want to watch this movie, get the DVD. I can't say that it's any better, but it can't be any worse.</p></body></html>

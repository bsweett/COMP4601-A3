You just do not connect with the film on the personal level.  The effects were super, but that was the main impact..."wow what amazing effects".  You feel like breaking out in a chorus of Peggy Lee's Is That All There Is.  Special effects alone cannot make a movie great.<p>Underworld makes that jump, great FX work, but also gives you characters you really care about, ones that you really love to hate.  A strong plot line designed to hook you and keep you, just does that.  With the emotional involvement, there is a greater impact, a movie that will demand repeat viewing.  Instant Cult Status.  <p>The movie grabs you from the opening and never lets up with the pace.  Firm direction and with a driving score, the movie reaches for perfection.  You have a 1000-year-old war between Lycons and Vampires, and it's all coming to a head.  It's a well thought out and executed premise and Kate Beckinsale shines!  She is an amazing talent.  I first adored her work in Cold Comfort Farm as Robert Post's child Flora.  When you compare that gentle, deft bit of humor with this kick a*** vampire hunter, it proves what an overlooked talent she is.  With Van Helsing out now (and I am sure this movie led to her landing the role), she is finally getting a spotlight she so well deserves.<p>A gloomy, atmospheric ambiance to the whole movie is maintained all the way through, adding a strong foundation for the otherworld premise.  I am sure some will nitpick things, as all vampire film faces, but kudos for the vibrant energy and sheer edgy feel to the film. <p>It leaves you hanging, clearly open for a sequel...one can but hope it maintains this high quality.<p>Kate rocks...you don't need to know anymore!</p></body></html>

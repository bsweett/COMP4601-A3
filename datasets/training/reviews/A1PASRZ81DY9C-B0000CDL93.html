After seeing JFK, it turned out that I was dead wrong. JFK is an incredible masterpiece and is the best movie ever in the whole career of Oliver Stone. Absolutely outstanding are the film editing, the story-telling, and most of all, the acting. Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, and Kevin Costner are mesmerizing and captivating. It's a shame that all of them, although I disagree vehemently with Tommy Lee Jones', aren't worthy of accolades. Simply, Kevin Costner is thoroughly brilliant. I've often complained that films taking on a supposedly huge magnitude and underestimating it, but Oliver Stone really did achieve the behemoth scale in its landscape based on the bureaucratic levels in terms of politics. Jim Garrison, in a brilliant quote, after learning the real story from Donald Sutherland's character sums up the startling discovery, "The size of this is...beyond me." Yes, quite so...so beyond me, too. JFK is just a brilliant political thriller. Three hours and twenty-six minutes of this director's cut whizzes through me like if it is a short story mystery. I absolutely love this movie so much for its attention-grabber, and I never thought conspiracy uncovering would have been this exciting as I saw in JFK. It is so methodically a much better film than Thirteen Days.<br /><br />6/11: JFK is a tour de force of performances from a throughly all-star cast at the hands of a master filmmaker. Oliver Stone has directed his best work in JFK. It's a complete picture, tackling a dangerous subject involving too many conjectures and "what ifs" with very little substantial proofs. In short, it's a conspiracy theory picture at best. It is also a great piece of work. Kevin Costner should be lauded for handling his work with ease and confidence. He is a professional actor who ranks up there with the best of the best. Obviously, everybody else throws their chips in and takes the picture further to another level. JFK is 206 minutes of fascination, never letting down or losing steam. It's a brilliant picture. All in all, JFK remains one of the best pictures of 1990's.</p></body></html>

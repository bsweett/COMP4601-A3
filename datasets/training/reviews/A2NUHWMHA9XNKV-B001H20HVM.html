<meta name="summary" content="in my opinion 4 stars b/c its actually a good sequel"></head><body><p>Great sequel<br />I saw this movie in the theater and I really enjoyed it! It is in my opinion way better that the first Saw. It keeps you guessing the whole movie and just when you think you have it figured out, another twist develops and you're wrong again. I really loved it and look forward to adding the DVD to my collection.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong the first saw is ok but its rare that a sequel is better than the first...<br /><br />I just wanna say you have 2 types of people on amazon, the type who really likes something and the type who hates on everyone for liking it, not because they think its bad but because they don't want to jump on the wagon like everyone else and admit its a good movie...</p></body></html>

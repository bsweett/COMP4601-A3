The film brings to the screen two main stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: On the one hand, Marie Antoinette, and her life at Versailles, and on the other (and to a much lesser extent), several events leading to the French Revolution (1789).<br /><br />The movie portrays superbly life at the Palace, and provides valuable insight into a very important period of French (European) History.<br /><br />We get a taste (though a very light one) of France's involvement in the American Revolution (beginning in 1778).<br /><br />Moreover, we get to see or hear about the lies and propaganda that helped shift public opinion against the Queen.<br /><br />The film is also excellent in showing that King Louis XVI did not wish to rule and was forced into that position following the death of his grandfather Louis XV.<br /><br />The major setbacks are in relation to:<br /><br />1) The TERRIBLE music with the exception of those moments when the music of the time can be heard.<br /><br />2) The movie is at times very slow, which breeds annoyance.<br /><br />3) Marie Antoinette had four children yet we only see three.<br /><br />4) Focusing too much on life in the Palace at the expense of historical events.<br /><br />Kirsten Dunst does a GREAT job as Marie Antoinette, though Jason Schwartzman (of all people!) portraying Louis XVI was a poor choice to say the least.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the setting, the dialogues, and the costumes are all wonderful!<br /><br />Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought-provoking movie that will provide for an evening's entertainment.<br /><br />The abrupt ending allows for a great cliffhanger so a sequel is in order.<br /><br />Strongly recommended along with Napoleon the TV Miniseries (starring Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossellini, Gerard Depardieu, and John Malkovich), Queen Margot (Isabelle Adjani), Brotherhood of the Wolf (Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel), and Vidocq (Gerard Depardieu) for those with a soft spot for French History.</p></body></html>

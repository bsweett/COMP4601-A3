<meta name="summary" content="Romero shows how to do it old school."></head><body><p>Twenty years after the lukewarm reception to the series third entry, writer/director George A. Romero is able to explore the other half of the scenario in his original, and un-filmed, Day of the Dead script.  All I can say is that, for this fan, it was worth every minute of the wait...<br /><br />Some time ago the dead began to rise up and attack the living.  Because a bite from a "walker", or "stench", is a death sentence, the people they killed got up and killed.  Society quickly crumbled, the major cities becoming fortified shelters for those lucky, or unlucky, enough to survive.  Within one of these fortified cities is Fiddler's Green, a shining luxury tower owned and operated by the wealthy Kaufman (Dennis Hopper).  To keep the people in the Green fed and happy Kaufman has built the Dead Reckoning, a muscular marriage of truck and armored vehicle, to go out into the "walker" infested areas and collect food, water and medicine.  Manning these runs are mercenary teams led by Riley (Simon Baker) and Cholo (John Leguizamo).<br /><br />The raid of Uniontown is Riley's last run.  While scouting the area, he notices that the "walkers" are remembering their former lives.  More disturbing is that they seem to be starting to communicate with one another.  His warning is ignored by Cholo, who just wants to grab some extra loot for financial gain, and the raid goes sour.  The team leaves Uniontown, but the "intelligent walker" that caught Riley's attention, a burly gas station attendant named Big Daddy, begins to follow...using Kaufman's glowing ivory tower as the visual goal to be reached.<br /><br />Riley and Cholo return to the Green, unaware that they are being followed by the undead.  Riley hopes to get a car he has purchased and leave the city for a simpler, and uninhabited, area.  Cholo hopes to buy his way into Kaufman's tower, but he is refused by the slimy fat cat.  Determined to bring Kaufman down to his level, Cholo steals the Dead Reckoning and Kaufman sends Riley out to get it back.  Meanwhile the zombie horde is beginning to launch an organized attack against the city...<br /><br />Based on my first impression, all I can say is that Romero does not disappoint.  Land of the Dead is a lean and mean (both figuratively as well as literally) thrill ride that both encapsulates and expands upon the concepts and storylines of the previous three entries in the series.<br /><br />The acting is pretty much the best in the series.  Dennis Hopper underplays a part that, if a little more ham had been added to it, would have become a cartoony figure.  By keeping it quiet and subtle, Hopper let's us see the vile and monstrous power that is coiled beneath his falsely gentle and polite exterior.  Simon Baker likewise underplays Riley, but considering that his character wants nothing more than to just disappear, his fading into the crowd likewise makes his character feel real.  John Leguizamo's Cholo is a swaggering mix of anger and frustration just waiting to explode...and explode he does.  I have to say that Robert Joy's Charlie is my favorite character.  A simpleton fiercely devoted to Riley who also serves as the voice of Riley's supressed soul.  Rounding out the main cast is the stunning Asia Argento as Slack, a prostitute who, when she is tossed to the zombies, Riley rescues and reluctantly befriends.  Argento manages to nicely balance Slack between being both vulnerable and as tough as nails.<br /><br />KNB's gruesome zombies and their feasting scenes are top notch, despite the cuts for an R rating.  Don't let that R rating fool you into thinking that Land is some kind of watered down vision, far from it.  There are more than enough gruesome set pieces to wet the appetite of the expectant gore hound.</p></body></html>

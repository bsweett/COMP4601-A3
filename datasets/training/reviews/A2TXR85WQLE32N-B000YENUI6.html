A first rate cast and a well-chosen London setting combine for a movie you can't take your eyes off of.<br /><br />When a 14 years old girl dies in childbirth in a London hospital, British-Russian mid-wife Anna (Naomi Watts) seeks out her family.  A card in the dead girl's diary leds her to the Trans-Siberian Restaurant, run by Semyon (a subtle Armin Mueller-Stahl), who just happens to be the local head of the Russian Mafia.  Anna's knowledge of the contents of the diary will place her and the new-born baby at risk.<br /><br />At the center of the story is Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), driver for Semyon and his drunkard son Kirill (Vincent Cassel).  Nikolai exudes a quiet, menacing charm, and a sense of purpose somewhat at odds with his junior status.  His additional duty as fixer of Semyon's problems brings him back into contact with Anna, the beginnings of a fragile relationship.  As betrayals pile up bodies and the lives of Anna and the baby hang in the balance, Nikolai will prove to be more than he seems.<br /><br />Mortensen is superb as Nikolai, the tattoed and ruthless career thief with a conscience.  A twisting and rapidly paced plot will bring the audience to a surprising conclusion.  "Eastern Promises" is a violent movie but highly recommended as well-made and atmospheric entertainment.</p></body></html>

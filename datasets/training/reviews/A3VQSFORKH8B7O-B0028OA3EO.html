The idea of finally seeing the world's most beloved superhero return to the big screen was a great one. However, I had some concerns with the people behind the scenes. I feared that the idea of making the Man of Steel a more emotionally-complex character would turn this into another melodramatic cry-baby fest, like the overrated "Spider-Man" movies. Also, I was not excited  with the idea of Bryan Singer directing, as the "X-Men" movies were not among my all-time favorites. And even though he had let Singer do the movie he wanted, producer Jon Peters had shown signs of ruining a new "Superman" movie (Just listen to what Kevin Smith said on the "An Evening with Kevin Smith" DVD).<br /><br />However, I left the theater with a huge smile on may face. While no film could come close to matching the first "Superman" movie from 1978, this new movie is still very good. The cast and crew have done a fantastic job of creating an exciting, character-driven motion picture. Brandon Routh does a fine job of filling the shoes of Christopher Reeve. He brings the warmth and humor that Reeve gave to both Clark Kent and Superman. And while the character is more emotionally-complex, he doesn't come across as a panzy like Tobey Maguire does in the "Spider-Man" films.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey does a terrific job as Lex Luthor. He retains the humor that Gene Hackman brought to the role, but also gives him a darker edge, making his version of the character more similar to the comic-book. The only real problem cast-wise is Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. She's just a bit too young to play the character. However, she still manages to do a fine job. The rest of the cast does a commendable job as well.<br /><br />Bryan Singer and his crew have done a terrific job of brining Superman back to the screen with the excitement, humor, and joy that made the first movie a classic. The plot is interesting, the story is believable, and the visual effects are Oscar-worthy. And while some may quibble with the comparisons of Superman to Christ, this doesn't detract from the film any at all.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" is great film-making. It ranks alongside "Batman Begins" as one of the greatest super-hero films of the modern era. I highly recommend "Superman Returns" to both Superman fans and fans of great films. You're sure to enjoy it.<br /><br />Grade: A+</p></body></html>

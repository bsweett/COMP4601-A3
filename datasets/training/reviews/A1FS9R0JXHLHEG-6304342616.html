<meta name="summary" content="Your Typical Action / American Film - But It's Great!"></head><body><p>Firstly, you're amazed by the alien ship that appears, curious about the contingency plan, and then completely blown away by the explosions and special effects. This is American patriotism at its very best, yet you forget all of that with the amount of action, comedy and typical plotlines. Ok, so the acting wasn't THAT great, but you can watch this film a hundred times and never get bored. There one liners always crack you up, and once again, America is always the one that saves the day! <p>A simple plot - aliens threaten the world's (more so America's) existence and someone (America) has to do something about it. With a cast led by Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum and (at the time) an aspiring Will Smith, that were all very good to watch, not forgetting the rather nice looking Vivica A. Fox as Smith's fianc? I can't really put a flaw in this film since it was great fun to see. God bless America! <p>Done in true US Military style, 'Independence Day' is an entertaining, patriotic watch - one big dose of eye candy which can be seen again and again.</p></body></html>

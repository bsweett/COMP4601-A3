The director had one single purpose here: to enter the history of movie making by shooting the first picture that moves backwards. Ok, he achieved it. Congratulations. But the history... my God, there is none!!! even the "Moral" dilemma of living in that kind of memory disorder is ridiculous !! The solution, for Leonard, is to become a killer, a good one because he doesn't feel regret (because he soons forget what he did!!!). When Teddy says that he already killed the "certain" killer of his wife, and proves it by showing a photo of LEonrad smiling full of blood, Leonard destroys the evidence (by means of burning this photo and the photo of the guy he just had killed), and selecting Teddy to be his next "target", the next man to be hunted to give some meaning to his life!!!! Bad taste, bad taste, bad taste. (...)</p></body></html>

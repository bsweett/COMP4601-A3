He wrote the story of "Jack Frost," about a father-cum-snowman who tries to bond with his son after he's already died (sorta).  He produced "Elektra," about the jaded and acrobatic wunder-assassin of the same name.  And he wrote and directed "Daredevil," a finely-filmed flop concerning the life and times of a blind do-gooder with super duper hearing.  None of these films were very well received, and their box office receipts were poor, at best.<br /><br />"Ghost Rider" is like those others with one very important difference; it's making money.  Johnson's budgets have inexplicably risen since each successive flub, and finally it appears to be paying off.  Hell if I know why.  After all, "Ghost Rider" adheres to Johnson's superhero formula without much straying; perhaps it's just a matter of a larger fan base or greater advance anticipation.  Or maybe people have stopped taking these kinds of movies so seriously.<br /><br />That's not a bad thing, but it isn't entirely good, either.  The Batman series, for example, was in serious decline precisely because it began to rely entirely on big names, brassy settings and effects, and heaping gobs of camp value.  It wasn't until Christopher Nolan took the franchise and injected a serious dose of soul into it ("Batman Begins") that people started to pay attention again and see beyond the conventional comic book trappings and into what made (and still makes) comics such a successful industry: the relatable idealism of its metaphors.<br /><br />Where does "Ghost Rider" fit into all of this?  Well, you have the typically tortured soul, Johnny Blaze (played as an adult by a slightly stunned Nicolas Cage sporting a chia-pet-esque hairdo), who is the son of a daredevil (wink, wink) and who is even a daredevil himself.  Blaze Jr. accidentally (yes, accidentally!) makes a pact with Mephistopheles (let's call him, oh, I don't know, Satan) which turns him, years later, into a sort of demonic bounty hunter.  Satan (in the guise of Peter Fonda, who fills this role with a sleepy sort of love) hires Blaze/Ghost Rider to catch four rogue demons, one of those demons being (drumroll) Satan's own son (the other three could form a band: Earth, Wind, and ... Water?).<br /><br />Of course there's a love interest (Eva Mendes).  Of course our hero buries himself beneath a mound of self-pity and regret.  Of course there's a wise-cracking buddy (Donal Logue) and a mysterious stranger who is full of key plot points (Sam Elliott).  Those things don't make the movie bad.  In fact, they're a cheeky nod at all of those comic book truisms; they're a silly-serious element to an otherwise gloomy and rather incoherent film.<br /><br />I'll be fair; I'm not a big "Ghost Rider" reader, so I don't really know the rules that govern his world, but, equally fairly, the movie doesn't bother explaining them to us.  When Blaze becomes his alter ego, he is a leather-bound skeleton cocooned in flames.  This is cool enough, but it does make it confusing when, for instance, Ghost Rider is almost choked to death by one of the demons (skeletons have esophaguses?).  And his horrific "Penitence Stare?"  Well, I still don't really know what it does.<br /><br />I try hard not to care, but when you turn your mind away from one thing, there must be something else to turn it to, and there's not much else here.  Batman and Bond both found new life in characters with more humanity, but Ghost Rider's life seems to exist solely in the fire that surrounds him.  Cage as Blaze does a good job of mixing humor with pathos (it's fun just watching him mope), but when he's the blazing Rider, he's all burning bone.  It's hard to gauge the inner turmoils, thoughts, dreams, plans, subterfuges, and conflicts of a hero who wears the exact same skull-grin expression no matter what he's doing.  The special effects of his incindiary bike, his chain-wielding stunts, his tete-a-tetes with the unholy hosts -- those are all popcorn-munching fun; but this reviewer would've been doubly impressed if those same special effects had been employed to do something else: give a skeleton some heart.</p></body></html>

I never trust Hollywood to tell the unembelished truth when it comes to fact based movies.  But from this movie Ray does not come across as a very likeable guy.  I never knew he was a heroin addict and a womanizer with fleeting loyalty for friends.  But Jamie Foxx does a great job convincing me he is Ray Charles.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is that it is just too long and drags in several spots.  How many flashbacks to his childhood do we really need?  The story covers Ray's life up to the 1970's and it feels like it does so in real-time.  At least the HD DVD transfer is very good with great picture quality and an awesome soundtrack.  But this is just a rental for me.</p></body></html>

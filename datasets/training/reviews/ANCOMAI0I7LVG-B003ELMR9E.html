In fact, this is the glitch in his fimography; a list of impressive feats that circle around an impressive re-imagining of Batman and some intriguing sci-fi ventures.  `Insomnia' has some superb moments, and facets of this film are truly strong, but overall there is a feeling of apathy that surrounds my concluding sentiments on the film itself.<br /><br />The idea here (of a LA cop lost in Alaskan daylight as he searches for a killer) has potential, and Nolan tries to uncover that potential, but it becomes too formulaic and predictable for its own good.  Instead of feeling lived in and exciting, most of the obvious `tricks' feel stagy and fake.  Swank proves that she cannot perform effectively without a gimmick, delivering a forgettable performance.  Pacino reigns in his usual theatrics, but he is less convincing than he needed to be.  Robin Williams gets under the skin with ease, and he festers.  He truly is the best thing about this film and definitely proves that he has more talent than many want to admit (he pigeonholes himself).<br /><br />I love Nolan (not as much as some, but far more than others).  He has a gift of imagery and he can capture moods with ease.  He does some good atmospheric work here (capturing unease in bright sunlight is hard to do), but at the end of the day, `Insomnia' is a little too mundane to make the desired impact.  It actually becomes tiresome and a tad boring.</p></body></html>

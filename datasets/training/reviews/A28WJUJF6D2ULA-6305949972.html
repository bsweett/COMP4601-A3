<meta name="summary" content="Tim Burton Is A Genius Par Excellence"></head><body><p>The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of the coolest films ever shot. Taking a viewer along on a trip into a dimension where each holiday has its own 365-day realm (it's Christmas all year, Halloween all year, Easter, etc.) Tim Burton's fantasy about Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King's, ill-fated but fabulous infatuation with Christmas becomes in these creative hands the most original movie made in the 1990's. Nothing wrong here, just a classic that'll reign for ages.</p></body></html>

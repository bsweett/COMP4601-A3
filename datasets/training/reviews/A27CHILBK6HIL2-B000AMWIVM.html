<meta name="summary" content="You Cannot Call This A Film, The Premise Has No Purpose!"></head><body><p>MOVIE: Wow, what a horrible movie.  I really mean it.  I haven't seen a movie so bad in such a long time.  An interesting premise and a very well put trailer would lead you to believe that this movie follows in the footsteps of Se7en.  Let me tell you how much of a joke this movie is.  Well, here is the plot, two guys wake up in a bathroom chained up to the wall and are being tormented by the Jigsaw killer.  A madman who actually gets the victims to kill themselves.  Interesting? Yeah it is. So what wen't wrong? Well the number one problem here was the acting, oh my god the acting.  I am going to say it here and now that this movie had some of the worst acting I have ever seen in my life. That goes for you too Danny Glover, shame on you.  You wanna know how bad the acting was? The acting was so bad that the entire audience was laughing at the film's climax, which was supposed to be the tensest scene in the movie.  The dialogue was so utterly horrible, so laughable. This movie follows the same goddamn formula that every psychological thriller does, except here there is absolutely no point to it.  Every psychologocal thriller has a "big twist" at the end, it's a must, but when the twist is the stupidest thing in the movie that has no connection to any of the characters then your movie has failed.  I didn't guess the ending, I knew it was coming, but I didn't figure it out.  The only reason I didn't figure it out was that there were no clues for the audience to pick off of, the plot is so literal and meaningless that they forgot to throw in the meaningful dialogue and visuals. There is only one scene in the movie that would allow you to figure out the ending, but the way it was done was so the filmmaker's made sure that the audience wouldn't pick up on it.  When I go see a thriller I want the filmmakers to outsmart and outwit me so I get a big slap in the face when the end comes and I say to myself "my god why didn't I see that in the first place".  Saw is a case where the filmmakers are too stupid to make a witty and clever plot so they fill it up with gore.  When a movie has a scene where a guy trips on a wire to trigger 6 shotguns to fire onto his head you know that the filmmakers are too stupid to come up with anything else.  This was the biggest joke I have ever seen and I am pissed at myself for going into this movie thinking it would be good.  I'm pissed because I know that the movie's marketing campaign worked on me and I fell victim to it.<br /><br />ACTING: You would see better acting from a blind mime.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Not scary, not disturbing, not fun to watch.  The audience knows exactly where the plot is going except they will have no idea who the killer is because the filmmakers won't allow it, that way they are sure that its a surprise for the audience at the end.  Okay you got the surprise, now what's the purpose? The only scary thing about this movie is the plot and acting.  Not once did I jump, not once was I questioning what will happen, not once was I impressed. If you haven't seen Se7en, then I beg of you to see it. Please see Se7en instead of this meaningless piece of crud.</p></body></html>

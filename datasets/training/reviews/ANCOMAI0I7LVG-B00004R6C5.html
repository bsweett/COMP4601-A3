<meta name="summary" content="A classic in every sense of the word; a film that still rings true today..."></head><body><p>I've been intrigued by the idea of `To Kill a Mockingbird' for some time now.  Knowing that it is rendered one of the finest cinematic accomplishments of all time had perked my interest early on but it became the movie I wanted to see but never got around to.  It's hard to find this little treasure in any rental place, but recently our library received a copy and so I snatched it up the second it was available.  Now I must say that I have not read the novel yet.  It's on my VERY LONG LIST of `must reads' but I just have yet to reach it.  After watching this film though I may have to reach that book a little quicker than anticipated.<br /><br />I guess the first thing I should say is that everything you've heard about this film is true, all the praise it received was well deserved and every second of it's running time is well worth it.  I was absorbed in this film from start to finish.<br /><br />`To Kill a Mockingbird' broaches the subject of racism in the South during the depression but it's overlaying message of equality and acceptance are what we should all be taking away from this masterpiece.  The film revolves around a count case involving a black man accused of raping a white woman.  Atticus Finch is the man selected to represent him.  The story is told through the eyes of Atticus' children, mostly his daughter Scout.  As Scout and her brother Jem battle their own quote-unquote prejudices with a neighborhood boy named Boo Radley they watch their father work to free a man he knows is innocent.  Atticus, a widower, works equally hard to instill good morals in his two children and raise them right and this is reflected in their ability to reason on situations, some even too big for them to fully understand.<br /><br />`To Kill a Mockingbird' has been labeled a classic, and you don't call them classics for nothing.  `To Kill a Mockingbird' truly is a downright perfect film.  The acting is superb, which is something I never truly expected.  I have watched a fair share of older films and have always found that the acting never truly stacks up to the great actors of today, but the performances by Gregory Peck especially rival those of today.  Gregory Peck (who won the Oscar for this performance) comes across so natural, so organic here.  He reacts as a father would, with subtleties when necessary as well as force.  His performance is understandably tempered and it helps aid the message of the film along.<br /><br />The two young children as well, Mary Badham and Philip Alford, are excellent here.  For young actors they grasped their characters exceptionally well.  Brock Peters is convincing as Tom Robinson, the black man on trial, and James Anderson is deliciously evil as Robert Ewell, the man accusing him of the crime (against his daughter).<br /><br />It was also interesting to see a young Robert Duvall here in a very small yet very powerful role.  He was truly commanding and played a key part in making this film's message a universal one.<br /><br />In the end I don't think there are enough good things to be said about `To Kill a Mockingbird'.  It's brilliantly scripted, acted and directed and stands the test of time, for while it was released in 1962 it still means something today, 45 years later.  `To Kill a Mockingbird' is a film that everyone should see in order to appreciate and one that I highly recommend to anyone with the slightest interest.  Don't wait any longer for `To Kill a Mockingbird' is one of those rare films that is actually WORTH the wait!</p></body></html>

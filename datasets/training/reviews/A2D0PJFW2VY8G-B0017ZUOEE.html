<meta name="summary" content="Lacks scares but brilliantly atmospheric!"></head><body><p>Having the honour of being presented by celebrated director, Guillermo Del Toro, Juan Antonio Bayona's horror film is another example of the atmosphere over blood and gore approach that I tend to prefer in this genre. Associations with Del Toro led to inevitable comparisons between this film and Pan's Labyrinth but I prefer to judge a film on its own merit so how did The Orphanage fare?<br /><br />The film begins with images of an orphanage by the coast where one of the resident girls, Laura, has been approved for adoption. Years later, Laura (Belen Rueda) returns to live in the same orphanage with her husband, Carlos (Fernando Cayo), and their son, Simon (Roger Princep), where she intends to provide a home for handicapped children. The family haven't been there long when Simon, who already has a group of imaginary friends, suddenly makes a new one called Tomas (Oscar Casas). His parents dismiss this as a phase but when Simon reveals Tomas has told him he is adopted and that he is ill (he's HIV positive), Laura begins to suspect something sinister is going on in the orphanage. Her fears are realised when she encounters a child wearing a sack mask that locks her in the bathroom and when she emerges Simon has vanished!  The film traces the following months as Laura and Carlos try to deal with Simon's disappearance and, in desperation, turn to a medium to help unravel the mystery of what has happened to their son.<br /><br />The first notable thing about The Orphanage is that it manages to convey a very tense atmosphere throughout. Familiar tricks of the trade such as inexplicably closing doors and footsteps at night do not seem old hat here but merely add to the overall tension. You always feel something bad is going to happen, you just can't figure out what. The scenic, but isolated, setting by the coast with a lighthouse in the distance creates further unease as does the cave by the beach where Simon first meets Tomas and leaves him a trail of shells to guide him to the orphanage. Laura later finds the shells stacked outside the orphanage!<br /><br />Rueda brings a lot to the character of Laura who appears to be the only one that realises the orphanage houses some threat that she believes to be responsible for the disappearance of her son. Carlos is supportive of his wife but does not think her fears have any substance and that Simon has obviously been abducted, most likely by the social worker, Benigna, who Laura argues with at the start of the film and who is later found snooping around the garden shed outside, which adds to the intrigue of the plot. It's not obvious what has become of Simon or who Tomas really is until the latter stages of the film where a shocking twist is waiting.<br /><br />Though atmospheric, The Orphanage is not particularly scary. The sight of the masked Tomas was one of the most sinister images but he is sadly underused in the film. First appearing at a children's party we next see him approaching Laura before trapping her fingers in the bathroom door when she tries to remove his mask! After this initial introduction his appearances are very limited as the environment of the orphanage takes over as the instigator of the uncomfortable tension in the air. The arrival of the medium to unlock the orphanage's secrets is one of the tensest moments as she is watched on several screens wandering the house alone while describing voices and witnessing the other unseen residents in the house!<br /><br />The Orphanage is an effective horror film despite the lack of real scares. The tense atmosphere from start to finish keeps it together and the plot remains captivating and difficult to unravel, with a horrifying twist at the very end. Though not the best horror film to come from outside Hollywood I still believe America should look at this one and take some notes. The Orphanage has a lot to offer but a few genuine scares could have made it a classic.</p></body></html>

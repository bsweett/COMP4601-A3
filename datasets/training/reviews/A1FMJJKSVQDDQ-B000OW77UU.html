<meta name="summary" content="Chris Gardner = someone that most of us can relate to, and look up to"></head><body><p>This is indeed a great inspirational film. It's the real-life story of Chris Gardner, a man who has struggled with both his finances and his support for his son. His only chance of success is becoming a stockbroker, and he tries his hardest during his internship while taking care of the only person he cares about. And he does this when he is evicted from his own home, and starts living in a motel, a subway train, even in a public bathroom. But Chris never gives up on not only his dreams of success, but his dream of his own son fulfilling his own dreams of success.<br /><br />Surely, this is a very inspirational film about perseverance, success, and family. And now this film is way more significant today. We're in the middle of a chaotic economic crisis, and it looks to be getting worse. Thousands of people are losing jobs and businesses, hundreds of homes are in foreclosure, food and gas prices have gone up, and big corporations are going bankrupt and being shut down. Of all the misery that the entire world is facing, there is still hope. We just can't give up on our own dreams. we can make it. We have to work hard at what we do and what we want to be, even if we can't pay our bills on time. Right now I'm twenty-two years old, and I'm still not giving up on my dreams of being a n author, despite many obstacles that I'm facing right now. My parents, older brother, and I have moved into an apartment just last year, and we're still facing major challenges. My parents and my brother aren't making that much money and are having trouble with payments, while I'm struggling with my grades (and money) during my fourth year in a community college and it looks like I've still got a few more years until I can actually transfer to a university. But I shouldn't feel horrible about all this. I still believe that we can pull this all off. We have to feel confident that we can achieve a great deal in the future. Right now, I'm in the process of writing several short stories, and I'm hoping to publish at least some of it this year. And maybe in a couple of years, I could publish my very first novel. With the obstacles I'm facing, I'm sure I can beat them.<br /><br />This is why "The Pursuit of Happyness," and Chris Gardner himself, is so special. It's a constant reminder that are dreams can be fulfilled. We have to work hard and believe in ourselves. If we quit, then we are disappointing ourselves and the people are supporting us. In the end, it's all about perseverance.<br /><br />"You got a dream, you got to protect. When people can't do something themselves, they want to tell you that you can't do it. You want something...you go get it. Period." -Will Smith, as Chris Gardner</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Clive Owen anchors this film with his gusto performance"></head><body><p>I admit, there are some things about this movie that were blown out of proportion a little bit but it's still better then Van Helsing damnit and even better then Troy. I really didnt care for Troy that much and I frickin' hated Van Helsing to the bowels of hell. Clive Owen (The Bourne Identity, Gosford Park, Croupier) plays King Arthur, this makes up for Beyond Borders with him and Angelina Jolie. Kiera Knightley (Pirates OF The Caribbean, Love Actually, Bend IT Like Beckham) plays Lady Guinevere. Knightley plays the same performance in dialouge like she did in CAribbean. Ipan Grussford played Lancelot did it to the max and I was pissed when they killed him off. Til Schwiger (Driven, The Replacement Killers) played a Saxon (bald head guy with the little braided goutee).At first I thought that was Moby but no, my wrong. Everytime he spoke it sounded like he was talking chinese and I was glad Lancelot killed his monkey ass. Stellan Saarsgaard (The Glass House, the upcoming Excorsist: The Beginning and The Savior) plays the leader Saxon. Why did they pick Saarsgard? I mean come on. The other knights of the round table were great and I liked the part where the tall bald guy axed the ass. Kick ass scene. I still like Caribbean better. They shouold rename this Pirates Of The Camelot: The Search For Freedom and Peace. Also Merlin as a forest man in paint was a shock. I was pissed cuz they didnt say anything about Excaliber like they did in the commericial and also the scene where Merlin yells like Gandalf. The director and editor are cheap. Also starring Ray Winstone.</p></body></html>

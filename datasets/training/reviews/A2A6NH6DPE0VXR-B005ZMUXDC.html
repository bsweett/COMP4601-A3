<meta name="summary" content="A very entertaining movie"></head><body><p>Tangled is a magical and funny movie that had my attention from beginning to end. I took my niece to see it and expected to be bored but that wasn't the case at all. I just wish that the white horse Maximus had more scenes because he's just hilarious and he's a scene stealer. I think he's the most original Disney character in awhile and he didn't even need any lines to be funny.</p></body></html>

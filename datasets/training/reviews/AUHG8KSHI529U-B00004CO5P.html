<meta name="summary" content="Even more powerful than I had remembered"></head><body><p>This is a very fine and very powerful film.  I liked it when it first came out, and now watching it with my children all these years later, I like it even more.  It is a rare film that not only holds up over time, but I found it a more powerful experience than I had remembered.  Why does it hold up so well?<br /><br />It isn't just the story that this regiment plays in the Civil War, or the story of Shaw leading and fashioning these brave men into soldiers, although that is a terrific story.  There are also the very powerful moments in the film that stay in the memory.  Matthew Broderick shows the qualities and the youth of Robert Gould Shaw.  He is a young man of high ideals despite his family's wealth and position.  He also has the ability to show courage despite his very real fears.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is quite powerful as the powerful Private Trip.  He is a man who has been so tortured and so abused that his anger has twisted him.  Yet, he still has a strength and nobility that shines through in several unforgettable scenes.  Morgan Freeman provides his magisterial presence as John Rawlins, who is tender enough to care for the mute drummer boy and tough enough to provide credible leadership as the eventual Sergeant Major to these new soldiers.<br /><br />Andre Braugher is fantastic as Shaw's friend, the very literate freeman Thomas.  His enthusiasm for the cause is boundless and his transition to becoming a soldier is quite hard for him.  He has so far to go from his comparatively privileged private life to the hard life of an infantryman.  He makes the role live brightly.  Jihmi Kennedy brings a lot to the role of the illiterate, but kindhearted Jupiter and I wish we saw more of him  on the screen whether big or little.<br /><br />All of them make that gospel meeting the night before battle a powerful scene in the movie.<br /><br />And don't forget the wonderful Cary Elwes who plays Shaws more worldly friend Cabot Forbes.  While he is Shaw's subordinate, he also has a fierce independence.  In some ways he is stronger than Shaw and in other he is less.  However, I don't believe Forbes could have accomplished the job in getting these men formed and into battle simply because his worldliness would not have let him believe it was possible.  It was Shaw's idealism (in the movie) that made it happen.<br /><br />Terrific.  And I recommend it strongly.</p></body></html>

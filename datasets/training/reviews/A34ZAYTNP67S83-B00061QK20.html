That being said, the production values are nothing short of remarkable.  The set design department outdid themselves, to say the least.  I can't think of too many other films that had me enthralled merely by virtue of their outstanding production.  But this is one of them.<p>A beautiful film to watch, but check out "Ju-Dou" and "Raise The Red Lantern" for superior storytelling.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="So-so ="></head><body><p>This romantic comedy was made in 2006 starring Sarah Jessica Parker as "Paula" and Matthew McConaughey as "Trip" - the romantic leads...<br /><br />Paula has a unique job as an "Interventionist" - which helps "launch" young men from living with their parents after a certain age -(around 26 years old).<br />Trip loves living at home with his parents - they feed him, they take care of housekeeping, and he is comfortable.  He is 35, has a job, and enjoys all kinds of sports. hat Trip's "extra" benefit of living at home with his parents is to "use" when he wants to end a relationship.  Trip's parents want to enjoy their retirement - have fun and privacy again.  They hire Paula to "Launch Trip" out of their home.  Paula falls for Trip, but there are hurdles to overcome.<br /><br />Some of the slapstick humor by the supporting cast makes for a good laugh, but overall the plot is predictable and is a basic romantic formula.</p></body></html>

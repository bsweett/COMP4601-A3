Night Shyamalan's latest picture is a charming picture full of hopeful yearning and powerful cinematography.  Most simply put, the film is a fairy tale set in a modern day setting.  That makes sense since the film is based on a bedtime story that Shyamalan told his own children.<br /><br />The movie revolves around Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) a janitor of a local apartment complex.  Something happened to Heep's family several years ago and it's left him a humble, but broken man who stutters.  While trying to catch who is messing around in the swimming pool at nigh, Heep falls in and discovers he has been saved by the lady in the water.  Her name is Story and she is a sea-nyph, or narf, sent from the Blue World to deliver a message.  She has to find a writer and Cleveland agrees to assist her.  But, things aren't that simple.  An evil creature from the Blue World, a snark (a creature that looks like a giant wolf, but with a covering that looks like grass), has followed Story and tries to kill her when she's supposed to return home.  Story only has one last chance to get home, but she can't do it alone.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti is perfect as Cleveland Heep.  I might be mistaken, but Giamatti has now become one of those actors who makes every movie he is in better just because he's acting in it.  Bryce Dallas Howard seems a little old for the role of Story, but the mysterious gaze behind her eyes captures the innocence suggested in the part.  Shyamalan himself plays a large supporting role as the writer Story is seeking to meet, Vick.  In the past, Shyamalan has put himself in his own films, but only as a minor character.  In this film his role is central to the story and he does a good job of portraying the struggling actor who will write a book that will change the world.<br /><br />Shyamalan uses a lot of great cinematographic techniques to support the fine acting performances and wonderful plot.  For instance, there is a scene where Cleveland and Vick attempt to talk to Story in the bathroom, but through an interpreter (Vick's sister). In this scene the camera pans above the room from Story to Cleveland and it's an amazing shot.  There are also a lot of interesting shots done underwater.<br /><br />THE LADY IN THE WATER is a departure from the type of films that Shyamalan has made before.  I also know that he received a lot of criticism for this film because of his tight artistic control over the project.  Therefore, there was a lot of negative criticism about the movie even before it arrived in theatres.  People wanted to pan the picture even before seeing it.  Nevertheless, the film succeeds.  It is a fairy tale set in a modern setting.  Since the death of Jim Henson, there has never been a director who has been able to make a fairy tale movie and do it right (Terry Gilliam could have, but he's never tried).  Shyamalan has finally done that.  He has done it and done it well.  All the elements of a fairy tale are there as well as many of the themes that Shyamalan delved into before in SIGNS and THE VILLAGE.  This movie is about faith; about how things have a purpose.  This movie is about love and hope.  It is about living a life to the utmost, even though everything around you seems to tell you otherwise.<br /><br />THE LADY IN THE WATER is a great movie.  It might not have done very well at the box office, but I predict that it will gain a huge cult following in the next few years.  Next to SIGNS, it is my favorite Shyamalan film.</p></body></html>

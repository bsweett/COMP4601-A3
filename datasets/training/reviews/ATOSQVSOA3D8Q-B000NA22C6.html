<meta name="summary" content="Slow, but ace movie.  2nd may 2004."></head><body><p>Although it is quite a slow film, i really enjoyed it. You have to watch it all the way through to understand it, and there is nothing scary about it even in parts there's that abit of a scare for some people. It does involve a couple of the same people over and over again and there arn't a lot of people in the film either. I won't tell you what the story is about, or i might ruin it for you. A FIRST SUSPICION FILM, THAT KIND OF CARRIES ON THROUGHOUT THE FILM. not everyone's type though.</p></body></html>

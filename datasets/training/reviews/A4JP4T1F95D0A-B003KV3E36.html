John Rambo living in Thailand since the end of Rambo III has managed to survive without trouble.  But after Christian missionaries convince him to drop them off in war torn Burma so they can help the oppressed locals, things change.  The missionaries are captured and John has to get them out.  Stallone holds up well despite his age, he still manages to convey a real sense of power from the character.  He doesn't have to learn many lines, since Rambo has very little speaking parts in the movie.  The action is very violent and gory--certainly a hard R rating.  The film is very realistic in what high caliber rounds and explosives will do to a human body.  There are more limbs flying and head explosions than I have ever seen in any movie.  Though the movie is 90 minutes long, it seems shorter.  There aren't any side sub plots, there is just a little set up and tons of action.  I also liked the ending, it seemed to close things out better than Rambo III did for the character.  Much the same way Rocky Balboa closed out that series better than Rocky IV.  Excellent Blu-ray picture and sound.</p></body></html>

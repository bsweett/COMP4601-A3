He lives a rather lonely existence, eating his meals in the local coffee shops and going home to a nearly bare apartment. However, Sy harbors a secret fantasy. Having developed the pictures of the Yorkin family for years, he beings to see himself as part of their family.  This is when it gets creepy.  Eventually the fantasy begins to blur with reality and Sy can't tell the difference.  Although it wasn't a movie where you'll be on the edge of your seat, you will want to keep watching more just to see what could possibly happen next.</p></body></html>

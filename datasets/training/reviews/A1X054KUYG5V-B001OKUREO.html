<meta name="summary" content="Interesting biopic"></head><body><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />The spiritual successor to Stone's "Nixon" (and a better film, in large part because it's an hour shorter), W. is a surprisingly empathetic biopic that follows the classic Greek tragedy form of a man undone by his flaws--in this case, that he's just not smart or strong enough to be President--to tell an interesting, if probably largely fictitious story; if you're interested in Oliver Stone or the Bush presidency the film may be worth looking into.<br /><br />3/4</p></body></html>

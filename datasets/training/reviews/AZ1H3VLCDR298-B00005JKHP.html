It also did not have the elements of the show that the Wrath of Khan and Search for Spock had, but looking back now it is a good film in it's own right. It was slower-moving, but I takes a lot of hard work to make the transition from small screen to silver screen. Case in point: X-Files Fight The Future. <p>A huge cloud is vaporizing everything in it's path, and the only ship capable of intercepting it in time is the refurbished Enterprise, with a new captain and crew. But Kirk takes command, and brings along his old bridge officers. The takes a while to get moving, but it is an interesting first look at the movie series, and still an enjoyable experience.</p></body></html>

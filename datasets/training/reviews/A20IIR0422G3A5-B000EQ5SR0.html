Better than average Extras."></head><body><p>`AeonFlux', directed by Karyn Kusama and produced by James Cameron colleague, Gale Anne Hurd, starring Academy Award (Best Actress, `Monster') winner Charlize Theron is, in spite of all earnest efforts, a mediocre Sci-Fi action flick. That is not to say this DVD is not an interesting purchase, as it is one of the first I have seen where the extras add as much or more value to the purchase as the movie itself.<br /><br />From long years of reading `Heavy Metal' and similar `adult' comic strip fare, I have developed the opinion that both the art and the plots in these works tend to be very derivative of more original works, especially very popular movies. And, since `Aeonflux' is based on an MTV animated feature, I find that it too is very derivative of more original works, in spite of the principle's protestations of originality.<br /><br />I strongly suspect that the primary inspiration for the general situation is the film, `Logan's Run' and the heroine has strong similarities to the video game adventurer, Laura Croft. And, I am sorry to say, that Ms. Theron simply does not carry off the distaff daring do as well as the excellent Angelina Jolie.<br /><br />My primary problems with the movie are that first, it does not fully set the premise up well enough early in the movie, unlike the excellent `Blade Runner' or `Minority Report' for example. Second, I develop no interest whatsoever in the fates of any of the characters. They stay flat against the screen, as do most comic book characters. There is none of the angst we feel for the cinema incarnations of Spiderman or Daredevil or Superman. Third, the world in the background is almost totally sterile. There are none of the rich textures of `Blade Runner' or even `Alien' or `Predator'. The extras do a lot to explain this, but do not relieve the tedium of the movie.<br /><br />I was quite surprised to discover that the movie was shot entirely in Berlin, which turned out to be architecturally even better than their first choice, Brasilia, in spite of the fact that Brasilia is almost identical to the fictional city in the film, as it is set deep in the Amazon jungle. The advantages of Berlin were that there was a thriving movie industry in the city that could supply all sorts of support crew, not to mention a wealth of great costumers and set decorators. And, the scenes were not all-modern post-World War II concrete. Some scenes were done in the gardens of Frederick the Great's summer palace and some other scenes were done in a pre-World War II build aircraft testing tunnel.<br /><br />I was also delighted to see that many of the costumes were inspired by the 1970's Bernardo Bertolluci film, `The Conformist', which I was also pleased to see was to be released on DVD soon, as it has always been one of my favorite Italian films. There were several video documentaries on the sets, costumes, special effects, and stunts, plus my favorite extra, two voice-overs, one by the star and lead producer and one by the screenwriters.<br /><br />One of my least favorite aspects of the movie is the fact that the great Frances McDormand appears in a role that totally wastes her talent. That comes on top of the fact that the rationale for the role is totally inexplicable, and connected to virtually nothing else in the film.<br /><br />Like so many comic book movies, including the Lara Croft epics, poor plot and characterization may be forgiven if the visceral impact is good. I found nothing here that got me the least excited about what was happening on the screen. All I could think about were the errors in science where, for example, they give the impression that characters somehow become immortal because they are cloned from one generation to the next. I'm afraid it simply doesn't work that way. A clone shares no more in the personality, memories, or `spirit' of the original than a naturally born baby shares any intellectual material from natural parents.<br /><br />In the end, this DVD is literally more valuable as an essay on making this kind of movie than it does as a visceral experience.</p></body></html>

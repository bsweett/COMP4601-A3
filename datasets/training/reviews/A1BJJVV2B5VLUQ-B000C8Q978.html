<meta name="summary" content="I'm convinced... Murray's days of King Pin, Groundhog Day and Caddyshack are gone"></head><body><p>First let me state that I loved Bill Murray back in the days of "Saturday Night Live", "Caddyshack", "Ghostbusters", "What About Bob", "Groundhog Day", "King Pin", Stripes", etc. Since perhaps the late 90's, his movie roles have changed... characters leaning to the softer more subtle side of humanity... often with impeccable timing. I know Murray is no longer the young pup filled with energy. He's an old timer now in Hollywood. With such a treasured past of movie roles on his resume, I can't help but get excited when I see a new movie of his getting ready to hit the movie theaters. I really had to scratch my head with his "Lost In Translation" (2003). Slow, boring and more importantly disappointing were not strong enough words. Now, 3 years later, "Broken Flowers" follows in the same vein. Slow, boring and again disappointing. How long can we sit and watch the main character drive his car, sit on the sofa, read his mail, stair out the window (without dialogue or any background music)? I agree with one Amazon reviewer here that the "pre-teen nudity scene" was unneccesary and "disturbing". Not to mention the abrupt ending... it just fades to black in the middle of a scene. After watching Murray's latest 3 bombs ("Lost In Translation", "The Life Aquatic...", and now "Broken Flowers"), I'm absolutely starting to think the days of Murray's comidic genious are well behind him. For me, "Broken Flowers" is a total downer and a very bland and bitter pill to swallow. Two stars for some interesting cinematography and some of Murray's dialogue with the neighborhood kids... but that's pushing it.</p></body></html>

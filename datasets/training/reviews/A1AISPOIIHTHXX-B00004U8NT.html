<meta name="summary" content="Probably in my top 5 favorite films ever"></head><body><p>Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a great example of a film doing away with conventions and making a compelling and even magical film that you can't imagine being made today. When it comes down to my top 5 favorite films ever, this tends to interchange with E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial. Whereas that film is still touching and more emotional, Close Encounters is filled with a visual splendor where the images are made to show us the wonder of things that can happen. Despite Spielberg's claim that it's the one film that "dates" him, it's still arguably one of his best, even in light of Schindler's List or Jaws.<br /><br />Roy Neery is a blue-collar family man who, while on the job, has a strange encounter with a craft with bright lights in the sky. The experience ends up changing him and pretty soon he becomes obsessed with it and one particular image which causes much trouble with his wife and kids. Elsewhere, a frenchman named Mr. Lacombe and his interpreter Laughlin are finding strange things around the world such as planes and ships in the desert and a curious 5 note melody. All of this ends up tying together in the end as everyone discovers something life changing.<br /><br />In the days of Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark, one thing that was never lost on Spielberg was making even mundane scenes interesting. From radio traffic controllers encountering something strange to Lacombe showing the famous hand signals matching the musical notes, nothing in this film seems wasted. Which of course makes the completely memorable images all the more striking such as Roy's truck going haywire, mother Jillian getting unwelcome visitors in her house to seeing just how massive the final ship is compared to the mountain, this film never feels like it just lags.<br /><br />One of the great things about Spielberg is that he actually explains why he shoots a scene a certain way or how he came up with a particular shot. Most directors go "well...thought it would be cool" but as he says in the excellent documentary on the making of the film; sure the mothership coming up from behind the mountain instead of the sky doesn't make any sense but it's an awesome image so who cares if it's not realistic. Included with the set is deleted scenes that didn't make the cut including the fate of the police officer who chased, (and flew over a ditch), one of the UFO's as well as the interior of the mothership with Spielberg being right saying it should've been a mystery.<br /><br />Is it as exciting and popcorn fun as Jaws? Or as serious and character driven as Schindler's List? Well no but that's beside the point since this is a film where you're almost glad something that feels this against the grain exists.</p></body></html>

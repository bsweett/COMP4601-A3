He shows zero feeling when he is acting, there seems to be nothing there....gather to guess that in his heyday, he may have done too many drugs or something. Ever since Osmosis Jones, his acting has not been something that I seek out. Terrible, not even worth a chuckle or anything in this case.  Yuck!!!</p></body></html>

I know many have complained about its CGI, but I actually found the vampire characters quite scary and believable.  I'm not sure whether it was explained how Fred the mannequin was removed from store or why the vampire population weren't turning on themselves for food.  Some of the plotlines were predictable but it doesn't mean they weren't still effective.  Losing Sam caused a lump to swell in my throat.  The thought of being completely and utterly alone was a bit much to wrap my brain around.  My problem with the film was the same as most: the ending.  The decision seemed so abrupt.  If the tunnel was strong enough to withstand the blast then it was strong enough for him to hunker in and wait until morning to leave with the woman and child.  Still this was a highly entertaining film.</p></body></html>

I didn't think it could get more charming and fun than that but Ratatouille proved me wrong. It's about a rat who has a scent for what's good food and what's bad food. His father just wants him to use that gift to make sure the clang aren't eating poisoned food. When the clang has to relocate he loses them but he can live with that since he find's his favorite late chef's restuarant. The restuarant isn't the same without the chef but the rat's taste for what makes good food could be enough to turn it back into a 5 Star Restuarant. Only an untalented new chef knows that it's actually the rat who's the talented new chef.<br /><br />  The result is a charming appretising film that has the style of an old fashioned Disney movie. It has as good of a story as the traditional animated Disney films that they don't make anymore. Plus it has of a good of a lesson as the older films do as well. Although I also like the "keep moving forward" lesson that we get from Meet the Robinsons. This movie is about following your dreams without letting anything get in the way. Plus it's also great to look at. Paris looks so great here that it makes you feel like you're there or wish you were there. The food looks great too and I had to go cook something right when I got home after seeing the movie. I strongly recommend this film to anyone, you don't have to be a kid to enjoy Ratatouille.</p></body></html>

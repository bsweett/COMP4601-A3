Despite never being a fan, and despising rap in general, I have to say that this movie is better than expected. The intangibles are quite strong. The guys in his crew and the shots of Detroit are very interesting. The idea of rap jousting is also pretty novel. As far as acting goes, Kim Bassinger is a stand-out in her portrayal of Rabbit's alcoholic, promiscuous, and broken mother. In terms of the plot itself, most of it will be familiar to those who know anything about the performers' life. I'm not sure how much of the film is autobiographical but it seems like a textbook example of "writing about what you know."<br /><br />In fact, it is Eminem's treatment of himself which really brings 8 mile down, and made it just another flick. Rabbit, as a man, just isn't realistic. He's a self-righteous martyr, and, while that might be the way Eminem views himself, such an angle makes for a really boring plot. Audiences just doesn't care much about guys who are wooden. There's nothing ambiguous about Rabbit; he's a great brother, loyal boyfriend, devoted artist, blah, blah, blah. Generally, people just aren't like that. He has a great group of friends in the movie, but frankly, I'm surprised they stay with him because he's so uptight, irritable, and melodramatic. He treats his friend David "Future" Porter terribly, although, for some reason, the guy forgives him. If he were able to detach himself more from Rabbit, I'm sure Mr. Mathers could have put together a more compelling script.</p></body></html>

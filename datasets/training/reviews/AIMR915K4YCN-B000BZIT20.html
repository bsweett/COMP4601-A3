This "Director's Cut" is actually a minute shorter than the theatrical release. There's a cool restored scene where we get to see Dallas and Brett coccooned against the wall! It's an eerie sequence with a high shudder-factor! We're all familiar with the story. The crew of the mining ship Nostromo is heading home, when a "distress" call forces them out of deep-space hibernation. The seven crew members are Dallas (Tom Skerett), Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Kane (John Hurt), Ash (Ian Holm), Lambert (Veronica Cartwright), Parker (Yaphet Kotto), and Brett (Harry Dean Stanton). The signal is coming from a nearby planet, so our heroes land and investigate. A wrecked spacecraft is found, containing an area filled with large, pulsating eggs. One of them hatches and springs open to unleash a hideous spidery creature that attaches itself to Kane's face! Back aboard the Nostromo, the creature seems to die and fall off. Unfortunately, it has left a little gift inside of Kane's body! The rest is a monster movie of nail-biting drama and fantastic special FX (no CGI here). The full-grown alien (one of H.R. Giger's best nightmare creations) is unlike any monster to ever ooze, slither, or creep across the screen! Though commonly known today, in 1979 it was quite a shocker! The shape of it's eyeless, over-sized head, it's drooling mouth-within-a-mouth, the mechanoid-reptilian body, all combine to make one tall glass of icy terror! ALIEN stands alongside JAWS, HALLOWEEN, THE THING, and other classics of jolting horror. Sigourney Weaver re-made the female action hero in her image! Beautiful, intelligent, resourceful, and lethal when necessary, she is a true survivor! ALIEN belongs in every DVD collection! This DIRECTOR'S CUT has very few changes since Ridley Scott himself prefers the theatrical release, seeing little need for alterations. Both versions are included here...</p></body></html>

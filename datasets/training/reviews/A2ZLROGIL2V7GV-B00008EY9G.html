'Identity' may be the answer that you're looking for, as it is a clever and dark thriller with a solid story, a terrific cast and a great look and feel to it all.  The film revolves around ten strangers who end up at a little motel due to a horrible storm.  All of them have been brought there by chance... or, is it a little more complicated than that?  They think they're out of the woods until people start getting butchered left and right, in a countdown fashion.  What appears to be nothing more than a murderer on the loose having his or her fun ends up being something a lot more sinister and threatening.  Have these ten individuals been picked at random, or have their fates been sealed from the very beginning?<br /><br />When I started watching this, I thought to myself, 'Oh boy, I bet you I know exactly how this is going to end.'  I was wrong.  The film takes a lot of clever and unexpected twists that really goes to show you how great a thriller can really be if the right brains are behind it all.  It has some great suspense and frightening moments, an intriguing plot that likes to play around with your mind, and it delivers a very confident presentation.  You'll recognize a good majority of the cast, as some of them include John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet and Rebecca DeMornay.  All are great, especially Cusack who proves that he can be a successful lead role in a top-notch thriller.<br /><br />The DVD has some cool goodies to offer.  You can watch it in widescreen or fullscreen, depending on which is your preference.  You also have the choice to watch the theatrical cut, or the extended version (not to be mistaken for a 'director's cut').  I must be honest and admit that the extended version is really not worth it.  The added scene does nothing to enhance the movie and the so-called 'alternate ending' isn't alternate at all, as it is merely extended by only a few seconds.  It was interesting to watch, but again it really doesn't do anything special for the film.  Stick with the theatrical version, then watch the extended version if you're still curious.  Trust me, the theatrical version is the way to go.  Other bonuses included on the DVD are deleted scenes, commentary, storyboard comparisons, theatrical trailer, filmographies and a behind the scenes featurette.  The film looks and sounds great.<br /><br />'Identity' is definitely something that should be checked out by those who are tired by the usual flops that dare to call themselves 'thrillers.'  This is a successful and smart thriller that offers chills along with an impressive script and cast.  Just be sure to give it a chance.  You may think you have it all figured out when it starts, but trust me when I tell you that this movie will play around with your brain until the ending credits.  A more than well-done thriller that doesn't disappoint and is worth re-watching again and again. -Michael Crane</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="GREAT ACTING,GREAT STORY,GREAT MOVIE...THE BEST OF THE BEST."></head><body><p>If you haven't seen this fantastic movie, let me tell you that you are missing what it's perhaps the best movie of all time. It's just perfect. You just can't miss when you put together the direction of Francis Ford Coppola at the top of his game, superb performances from great actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and John Cazale, beautiful music from the composer Nino Rota, and a memorable cinematography courtesy of Gordon Willis.<p>There are a lot of timeless scenes in this mob film ("I believe in America"), plenty of quoting lines ("I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"), fabulous supporting characters (Luca Brasi), and the list can go on and on and on. In my opinion, this is the movie that beats all the rest of the films. I think that all movie fan collection must include "The Godfather". If you haven't seen it yet and you are looking for a fantastic film, go see a classic film, go see "The Godfather".<p>Absolutely recommendable.</p></body></html>

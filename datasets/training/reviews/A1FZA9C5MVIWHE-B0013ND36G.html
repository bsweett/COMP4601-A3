<meta name="summary" content="this movie is HOT!"></head><body><p>this movie is the bomb. Kristanna Loken sizzles in her first role as the T-X. Arnold Schwarzeneggar as always does an excellent job as the T-101. at the end of the movie, a lot of bombs fall, which is why I say this movie is the bomb. Arnold became a governor so don't expect any other movie to come from him.</p></body></html>

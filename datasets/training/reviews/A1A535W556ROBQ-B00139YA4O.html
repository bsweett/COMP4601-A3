However, I for one had a lot of qualms with season one, which struck me as very discordant.<br /><br />I have a feeling that Abrams and co. had no idea what they were getting into at the start.  What begins as a plane crash on an apparently remote island soon takes on many mysterious tones with a huge ensemble cast not much unlike those old Airport movies from the 70s.  The cast is made up of relative unknowns giving the show the initial feeling of a staged reality show, but the writing has a lot of gaps, and the actors really seem to struggle with their roles in the early going.<br /><br />But, a core group soon emerges, much to the chagrin of the other "Lostaways" such as Arzt, which pretty much carries the action.  Even still it is a pretty big group and doesn't break down easily along the lines of other castaway shows like Gilligan's Island, but I can't help seeing Jack and Kate as the Professor and Mary Ann.<br /><br />The writers, who earned their chops on such shows as Nash Bridges, Alias, Brisco County Jr. and Six Degrees seem to take elements from near and far when it comes to island movies and TV serials.  One can't help but sense the menacing feel of Jules Verne's Mysterious Island or even H.G. Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau, but the threads that develop seem to come more from the 70s, when we were all absorbed with Bermuda triangle theories, alien encounters and supernatural thrillers.  The Island gives them a lush venue to update these themes and keep you going with a number of tantalizing threads.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the writing stumbles and falters and the situations don't bear up that well under scrutiny.  This show is mostly for effect, not for any deep underlying themes, and seems to be developed pretty much from week to week.  But, take heart, Lostophiles say that the show only gets better with each passing season.  However, I give the first season a B-.</p></body></html>

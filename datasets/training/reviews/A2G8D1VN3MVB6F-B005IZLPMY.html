<meta name="summary" content="Plain vanilla treatment of an American hero"></head><body><p>This was a supreme letdown. I was expecting something that was as cool, smart, and brave as the comic book. What I got was a bland rehashing of some hero-like story that was too focused on being politically correct rather than true to the comic book. This simply made it annoying and boring, rather than aspiring or relevant to today's kid. All in all, this was a fatal flaw with the movie. The acting was good, but this made the movie almost unwatchable. Get it, but be ready for politically correct hero-like antics. :(</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Interesting to see the dress, but life would have been even more cruel"></head><body><p>I was surprised that I ended up enjoying this movie more than I had expected I would.  Yes, there are some gruesome scenes of violence, but nothing as awful as it could have been.  The worst is seeing a jaguar chew on a mans face while killing him, or the heads bouncing down and the headless corpses rolling down the steps of the temple (as was done by the Maya).  The cutting out of the hearts is actually worse in "Temple of Doom".<br /><br />Still, the level of savagery is quite high.  The life of the Maya was harsh and filled with war and violence.  I believe it was far worse than is depicted in this film.  Certainly, the life of women would have been far harsher than the near equality they are given in this story.  Maybe another reason for the "R" rating is that the dress of the Maya is pretty much as you see it on the murals without any attempt to cover things to our comparatively modest standards.<br /><br />The story is about a man who is part of a small village deep in the forest.  For them this was the good life.  Another group of people asks for passage through their land because their village was ravaged.  I do not believe that they would not have exchanged information about what happened, but they don't talk to each other here.  I hate it when a plot point depends on someone not saying something or asking something obviously important.<br /><br />Along come the warriors from the big city in their fierce dress.  They slaughter and take captive the entire village, including our hero, Jaguar Paw.  We have gotten to know most of the central people in this village so this event is quite powerful.  Jaguar Paw works frantically to hide his pregnant wife and son and then goes to help fight for his people.  He is taken captive and marched to the city.  I appreciated the cruelty and indifference to life shown here.  Again, if anything, I think it was more mild than real life probably was for these people.<br /><br />He and his people are not destined for slavery, but for sacrifice.  I will leave you to watch the movie to find out what happens.  However, this movie is set immediately before the Spaniards arrive.  I mean immediately.<br /><br />The dialogue is in Mayan (I guess, I don't speak Mayan so I can't tell you for sure) with subtitles.  There is really not much dialogue so it is quite easy to follow and what little reading there is comes quite naturally after a few minutes.<br /><br />While certainly not for everyone, and not even young teens, it is a decent film.  Not everything is historically accurate, but I certainly found it interesting to see the people in the Mayan murals come to life in their dress, hairstyles, weapons, forest habitat, cruelty, and ignorance.  I particularly noticed how power was tightly held to the few over the many.  The one real flaw I saw in the film was that the people in the forest seemed unaware of the big city.  However, if you read about the Spanish Conquest, it is amazing how fast news spread and how efficient the information systems were.  And given how important information about people who could destroy you is, I think they would have known everything about the city and its people and intentions towards them.</p></body></html>

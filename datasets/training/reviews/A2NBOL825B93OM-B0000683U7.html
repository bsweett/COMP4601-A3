<meta name="summary" content="I'll have to catch up with my Hitchcock"></head><body><p>Many people in my generation think that movie-history began with &quot;Back to the future&quot; and ended in &quot;Titanic&quot;. Don't get me wrong, I like both of them, but, really, cinema is way more than that. When I ask information about older movies to older people they seem to loose focus, their eyes become lost in the far horizon, and they say &quot;Yes, this is a great movie&quot;. But the problem is, they say that to EVERY old movie. I once tried to watch Casablanca; in fact, I watched the whole movie, but I didn't really like it. Casablanca is not an ageless movie, so I think it meant more to people who saw it when it was released than to me, watching it forty five years later. <p>With &quot;North by northwest&quot;, however, the situation was completely different. First of all, it is listed number 18 on imdb's top 250 films of all time. Second, I have watched the more famous Hitchcock movies, like &quot;Rear window&quot;, &quot;Psycho&quot;, &quot;Vertigo&quot;, etc, and I find Hitchcock an amazing director. His techniques, his directing style, are very similar to what we see in movies today, to what I'm used to expect in a movie. And I think his films deal with subjects that don't seem to get old. <p>In &quot;North by northwest&quot;, Cary Grant is the man on the run for being mistaken for an agent he is not. During all the movie, he has to escape his nemesis, in famous and unforgettable scenes like the plane-man walking chase and the final pursuit on top of Mount Rushmore. When there is no action scene, there is the BEST dialogue I've ever seen on screen (very funny, fast and intelligent), between (mostly) Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint, the beautiful double-agent who falls in love with Grant. <p>This is really one of the most enterteining movies I've ever seen. I'm not going to say things like &quot;Nowadays, we don't have movies like that anymore&quot; because it's not true. People used to make good movies, and they're still making it today. You just have to have the capacity to know what is good from what is bad. <p>Great movie<br />Grade 9.5/10</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Choppy and felt abbreviated but Liev Schreiber is mesmerizing"></head><body><p>I think this movie is supposed to feel chaotic like a dream where scenes flash into the next in an upsetting manner but it leaves the impression that this movie should have been better.  I get the feeling that I am missing something no matter how may times I rewatch this movie and I think that is the intended effect of the film.  In any case, the performances are strong including an enjoyable outtake of Meryl Streep talking about her ambitions for her son.  I recommend it because I enjoy Liev Schreiber but don't expect an excellent movie, just excellent but brief performances.</p></body></html>

Secondly, If I had the choice of seeing this movie again, or bashing my head in with a big blunt object, I would grab the biggest rock I could find and smash away. This movie is a disgrace, and I'll tell you why I think this in a second. Before I go any further though, let me just say that this movie does have some very morbid and graphic torture scenes, and it does have a few good scenes to make you jump, but that's about it at the very least. Now, I hate this movie for so many reasons that I can't even keep count, but mostly because it wasn't what I expected it to be, or what they hyped it up to be on the previews. If you're looking for a horror or scary movie to watch this definitely isn't the movie for you, but if you need a good laugh it's perfect. Afterall, I laughed my head off because some of that stuff was so cheesy. I don't really think the budget was really the major problem because there have been some brilliant movies that had small budgets, but I do think this movie was just written terrible. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate the concept of this movie, but what I can't appreciate is the shabby way they put this movie together, and then smacked us in the face with that horrible ending. I'm sorry to spoil the ending for you if you haven't been fortunate enough to see this movie, but I gotta say that having an old man that was already dying turn out to be the insane killer at the end was pure GENIUS! I wonder who's bright idea that was. I felt so cheated by the time the movie ended I just sat there looking at the credits going they can't be serious. For crying out loud, they could've just kept the hospital orderly the killer if that's the best that they could do, and even that was too far-fetched. I could bash this movie all night long, but the last thing I have to say is that I had a choice in seeing this movie, or watching "The Grudge", and I wish I would have picked the other movie.</p></body></html>

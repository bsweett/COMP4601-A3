<meta name="summary" content="A Very Good Re-Make of the Original Classic"></head><body><p>Everyone can recall the earlier "Poseidon Adventure", released in the early 1970s and starring Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Shelley Winters, etc.  While the earlier version was exciting and thrilling, this new version is just as exciting and thrilling in its own right.  The special effects have improved dramatically over the past 30+ years since the original film was made, and these are the highlight of the new film.<br /><br />As for the story, the plot remains basically the same.  The SS Poseidon is on a New Year's Eve cruise when a gigantic tidal wave strikes the ship, causing it to capsize.  Instead of immediately sinking, the ship has "turned turtle", and now the hull is facing upright.  After the ship has turned over, the captain urges the surviving passengers to remain in the ballroom, because he believed an automatic distress signal has been sent and the ship should be able to remain afloat for several hours; long enough for help to arrive.  Tragically, he was wrong.<br /><br />One person not waiting around to be rescued is Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas), a professional poker player.  He immediately begins to formulate a plan to somehow make his way "up" which is really down, into the bowels of the uptuurned vessel to find a way out.  Along the way, Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), a retired firefighter and former mayor of New York City, Maggie James (Jacinda Barrett), her young son Conor (Jimmy Bennett), stowaway Elena (Mia Maestro), and Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss) decide to join Dylan and search for a way out.  Robert informs the group that his daughter Jennifer (Emmy Rossum) and her fiance Christian (Mike Vogel) were in the ship's disco when the wave hit.  The group struggles their way up to the disco to rescue them.  After recovering Jennifer and Christian, the group begins a perilous climb through the bowels of the ship, all the while racing against time.  The watertight compartments have begun to fail and soon the ship is beginning to settle further in the water.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the determined group of survivors has continued to make their way through the ship, swimming through narrow passages and into vent tubes, all the while trying to avoid the onrushing flow of the sea.  Will the group make it to the bow and be able to escape through the propeller tubes, as Dylan has discovered to be a safe way out, or will they all suffer the same fate as the other passengers aboard?<br /><br />This is an exciting and thrilling movie that is topped off with eye-popping special effects and superior acting performances. Some reviewers have commented that the characters were not as developed in this movie as they were in the original film, but I would disagree.  I felt that the strong performances, especially by Kurt Russell (Robert), Josh Lucas (Dylan), and Richard Dreyfuss (Nelson) were one of the high points of the film.  I found myself easily relating to all of the characters, and I was genuinely wondering who would play the part of hero next?  Would it be Robert, who vainly tried to save the life of Elena, or would it be Dylan, who risked his own life several times to save the rest of the group?  On the contrary, I found the character development to be excellent.  The aforementioned special effects, especially the scenes with the wave striking the ship, is what really made this movie stand out from the original.<br /><br />Having viewed both movies, I feel that each deserves a high recommendation.  The original contains many famous actors, and the original storyline was developed, but this great re-make deserves its own place as one of the great "disaster" movies.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  If you're a fan of great special effects and believeable characters, then you won't want to miss this thrilling and exciting movie.</p></body></html>

McLaughlin<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Darren Aronofsky<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Drama / Thriller<br />Release Date: 17 December 2011<br />Review Date: 14 January 2011<br /><br />Black Swan was a good movie, but it wasn't as great as everyone's making it out to be and it certainly wasn't filled with all the risqu&eacute; sex you've been hearing about. I'll go on record saying - there is no sex in the movie at all.  There are some pretty steamy close calls and a very erotic moment of Natalie Portman alone in her bedroom - but no sex. What a bummer.<br /><br />I only mention this because the movie is oozing with sex appeal and it is drenched with the anticipation of sex to come, without the payoff. This is something that the film forced me to expect Portman's character to embellish in. Luckily it makes up for this with an Oscar worthy performance by Portman (for which I'm sure she'll win), and an equally amazing directorial consummation by Darren Aronofsky who also brought us 2008's The Wrestler.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but I refuse to jump on the band wagon of those who claim Milla Kunis is warranted a nod as well; my gut tells me the bitchy role comes pretty natural to her, and if I'm wrong, it's nothing we haven't already seen her do once or twice.<br /><br />So I'll continue by stating that Portman stars as our lead character Nina and Kunis is her costar, Lilly. Nina is the nice girl; Lilly, the bitch. They both are interested in the same lead role in a ballet play called Black Swan. When Nina wins the role over Lilly and everyone else, there is some hostility to say the least.<br /><br />Nina is very grateful to be given a shot as prestigious as this, and she shows this to us in an instant flood of tears in a private bathroom stall. Lilly matches Nina's gratefulness, with endless looks of cold jealousy, to which Nina seems to not know what to do with, nor does she really sense the girl that Lilly really is, when they begin to hang out together.<br /><br />This is what draws us in to Portman's portrayal of Nina. She's shy, timid, probably a virgin, and we get the sense that she's uncomfortable in her own skin. So much in fact, that she often picks at it, to the point of drawing blood. She lives with her mother (Barbara Hershey) who is smothering and controlling nearly to the extent of a villain in any number of Disney classic evil step mothers.<br /><br />Everything in Nina's world evolves around her work as a ballet dancer. Her mother is infatuated with the details of her long days in rehearsals, as she gave up a similar dream years ago, to take care of Nina. For that there is some bitter resentment.<br /><br />Nina is a grown woman, but her mother does not like the idea of locked doors, and we get the notion that she cleans Nina's room for her too, which is overly stocked with stuffed animals and child like trinkets. There has been no sex in this room, and there shant ever be. So you can imagine the shock of Nina's mother when she brings someone home with her after a night of drinking, and jerry-rigs the door shut.<br /><br />Nina has done this because she is becoming invested in her character to the point of mad obsession. The play calls for Nina to begin the first act as a `white swan' who is an innocent, to which she will transform into a `black swan' who is evil, and then kill herself when her lover has betrayed her for another woman.<br /><br />This movie is very bizarre and I liked it; particularly trying to figure out just what the hell was going on. It's twisted and dark and will only continue to gain more popularity as the word of so spreads.<br /><br />Credit is due to Darren Aronofsky, because now that I think about it, I'm never a fan of the subject matter in any of his films: professional wrestling in The Wrestler, drug addiction in Requiem for a Dream, and ballet dancing here; but yet I found all three films entertaining to include their subject matter.</p></body></html>

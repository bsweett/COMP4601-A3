<meta name="summary" content="Another masterpiece by Spielberg!!!"></head><body><p>This is the 2nd best movie of 2002. It has ver good acting, great story, incredible visual effects, and the perfect soundtrack. The movie is set in 2054, with its central premise of "Precrime" law enforcement, totally reliant on three isolated human "precogs" capable of seeing the future. That's original, so I knew I'd enjoy this. I was at the edge of my seat in awe of how great this movie was, and it wasn't even over! Anyway, as Precrime's confident captain, Tom Cruise preempts these killings like a true action hero, only to run for his life when he is himself implicated in one of the precogs' visions. He makes one heck an escape, even has his eyes changed! Making good use of astonishing special effects, Minority Report brilliantly extrapolates a future that's utterly convincing, and pretty dang cool if you ask me. It knid of reminds me of A.I Artificial Intelligence. You must see this movie, it is so good. BUY IT NOW!</p></body></html>

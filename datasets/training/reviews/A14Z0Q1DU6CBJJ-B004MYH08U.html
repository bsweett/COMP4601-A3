<meta name="summary" content="A LITTLE LESS TALK AND A LOT MORE ACTION"></head><body><p>Much has been the case with many action/superhero movies over the past few years. Are the creators of these movies not sure if they're gonna make any money with their project or have action scenes become that expensive? If their gonna skimp out on the action scenes, how about writing a really good script that compensates for it. Well, they didn't really do that either.<br /><br />Many of these movies are falling into the exact same cookie-cutter formula style movie making. Iron Man 2 must have had the exact same screenwriter. Introduce bad guy in the beginning, spend an hour or more delving into the personalities of the hero(s) and then pour everything you have into a slam-bam finale. Oh, and since there isn't a whole lot going on in the middle, have hero shoot fruit in a drunken stooper or have hero(s) fight each other for no good reason.<br /><br />I give credit to the filmmakers for stepping away from the special f/x riddled movies we see these days, and keeping many of the stunts completely real, but everytime Jay Chou/Kato does his thing, does it have to be in slow motion? As real as the car chases and car smashes were, the fighting scenes were Matrix/Resident Evilish.<br /><br />Green Hornet isn't a complete waste of time, but it was certainly disappointing in an ongoing calvade of movies being paraded out over the past few years that have no depth, creativity, no quality writing and seem to only have one goal in mind, to dazzle visually. GREEN HORNET doesn't even do that, and if it wasn't going to do that, then they should have written a script that grabbed us.<br /><br />On a final note, Oscar winner, Christop Waltz "Bloodnofsky" was completely wasted in what could have been a great and memorable bad guy. Yet, he was delegated to a scene in the beginning, a short scene in the middle and the finale.</p></body></html>

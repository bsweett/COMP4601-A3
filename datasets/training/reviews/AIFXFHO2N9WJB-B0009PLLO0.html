My thinking was it stars Colin Farrell, Val Kilmer, and Angelina Jolie, plus it's directed by Oliver Stone how could this movie be bad.  Well, needless to say it managed to be not only bad, but horrendous.  After several friends of mine saw the film and hated it, their reasons were vast and shared by many, here are a few examples of their complaints; too slow, too much focus on homosexuality (Alexander the Great was believed to have been bisexual which was common among Greeks, yet this film paints him as only being gay), there's no sense of a greater destiny for the character, horrible editing and time jumps, just to name a few.  But for the DVD release Warner Brothers announced that Oliver Stone had re-edited his would-be epic film and now it is about 30 minutes shorter, much faster paced with more action, and a more balanced view of his sexuality (basically giving more screentime to Rosario Dawson as his wife, Roxanne).  So like an idiot I took the bait, and rented "Alexander: The Director's Cut", now since I never saw the theatrical release I can't say how much faster paced this version was, but to me the pace was excruciatingly slow and still focused too heavily on homosexuality.  But that's enough gripes for now, let's move on to the outline for the story and then I'll gripe some more at the end, but I do have a few good things to say as well for the film, so please read on.<br /><br />"Alexander: The Director's Cut" follows the life and conquests of the man history has dubbed `Alexander the Great'.  Alexander was born of royal blood, his father was King Philip of Macedonia (Val Kilmer), a rough, womanizing, drunk of a man; and his mother was Olympia (Angelina Jolie) who many believed to be a mystic and whom herself believed to be a descendant of the gods.  With parents like these Alexander was destined to be somewhat messed up, yet he managed to overcome these two powerfully controlling forces and become one of the greatest leaders and military tacticians of all time.  After the death of King Philip, Alexander assumes the throne and sets off on a quest to conquer the known world.  From the deserts of Afghanistan and Persia to the lush forests of Asia, Alexander's ingenuity for military tactics enabled him to defeat almost any foe he encountered.<br /><br />Now this story sounds intriguing, but Oliver Stone manages to butcher it with terrible editing and time jumps through Alexander's life.  In one moment Alexander is a teenager, the next we're 20 years into the future and he has already conquered several countries.  Also though no sexually explicit scenes between men were shown it was heavily implied, especially between Alexander and his best friend Hephastion (Jared Leto).  This strong overtone of homosexuality wouldn't have been so distracting if it wasn't in every single scene, plus the fact that Alexander is believed to have been bisexual meaning there should have been more focus on the women of Alexander's life.  And yet another problem was that you really don't care for Alexander, in epic films like this you should care for what is going to happen to the central character, whether he lives or dies, whether he will triumph or fail.  In this movie I found myself not caring at all, I would have been fine if Alexander would have died during the first battle, at least the movie would have been over sooner.  Truthfully, the most interesting characters in the film, and the ones I wanted to know more about were Alexander's parents, King Philip and Olympia.  That alone tells you how much of a failure this film is for Oliver Stone.<br /><br />Many people gripe that the casting was all wrong, actually I felt the casting was great, Colin Farrell was very good as Alexander, he just didn't have much to work with, and Val Kilmer and Angelina Jolie were outstanding as the controlling parents of history's greatest conqueror.  The casting was not what made this movie fail, as I have alluded to in my complaints of this movie, the biggest reason for "Alexander" failing at the box office and on DVD is none other than Oliver Stone himself.  Oliver Stone is known for making very complex and engaging movies, and for loving controversy which is probably why he infused so much homosexuality in this movie.  If Stone would have just gotten beyond his penchant for controversy and focused more on Alexander's conquests rather than his much debated love life, this film could have been the grand epic it aspired to be.<br /><br />"Alexander: The Director's Cut" is rated R for violence, language, and sexuality/nudity.</p></body></html>

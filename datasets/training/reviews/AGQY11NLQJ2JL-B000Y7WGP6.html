<meta name="summary" content="Saudi holds the origins of corruption; the sad part is that this was never a secret!"></head><body><p>FBI agents investigate terrorism related crime scenes and encounter serious life threatening incidents that eventually raise very important questions? Where and how al-Qaeda started? How is it related to the Gulf War and oil business? Why are we all blind to the obvious? And why this hell will never end if we don't achieve universal political maturity?<br /><br />Enjoy the action packed scenes and be patient until the final scene that reveals the secret craziness, which is more complex than it seems. I hope that viewers will be open minded enough to understand the hidden message and not get tangled in yet another cycle of hatred.</p></body></html>

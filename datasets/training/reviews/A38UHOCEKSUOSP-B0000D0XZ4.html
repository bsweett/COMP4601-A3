<meta name="summary" content="There's a reason "incredible" is not in the title"></head><body><p>It is unfortunate, but Hulk is so far my least favorite of all the comic book movies that have been created.  One would think the Hulk could easily make the list as one of the better comic films, being the popular and dominating comic book creation he is, but director Ang Lee and a lackluster story keep this movie from being incredible, though effects still keep it somewhat enjoyable.<br /><br />I'll be honest, it took a few seperated viewings for me to get through this film, as it is so slow and boring throughout.  There is too much dialouge (and uninteresting speeches) to occupy a film featuring such a massive creature as the Hulk.  Eric Bana, though a wonderful actor, does little with his character of Bruce Banner, making it difficult to understand the true emotions within this man.  When he turns into the Hulk, its really the only part that becomes exciting (and very well should), but at that point we have a CGI creature that doesn't talk, just runs around and wrecks everything (which admittadly, is fun to watch as the visuals effects let loose and show off).  Betty Ross is handled fairly well by Jennifer Connely, but the relation between Bruce and Betty isn't nearly as emotional or exciting as it could be.  Again, most of the interaction was slow and boring, and though I could feel there were some emotional struggles between the two characters, I felt like I had to think about it too much to realise it.  The rest of the cast wasn't anything special either, and overall, acting on everyone's part was below par as far as comic book movies go.<br /><br />The directing is my next issue.  I give credit to Ang Lee for his comic book style of split-screens, picture in picture and so forth.  But the truth is the multiple angles for many of these scenes grow tiresome and distracting from the real action.  Fortunately during the Hulk action scenes in the film, little of this style is used, or esle it would have been impossible to enjoy.<br /><br />So where is the excitment in this film?  It is when Bruce becomes the Hulk.  The creature is massive and an impressive CGI, but to be picky, the closeups of Hulk make him look too smooth and not as rugged and detailed as he could be.  He destroys practically everything he comes incontact with, and can toss military tanks with ease - a truly enjoyable sight to watch.  Also enjoyable are the scenes when Hulk is jumping among the mountains throughout canyons, but at some point you stop and ask yourself "is he jumping or flying".  It becomes a little overdone, but nevertheless, if you have a big screen television it is a sight to enjoy.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is just bad.  I find it very hard to sit through the entire 2 hour 18 minute run.  The 15-20 minutes of non-stop action about 1:30 in the film is all that will keep you awake.  Hulk could have been an impressive film, but so much went wrong as mentioned above.  Thankfully, this summer of '08, a new Hulk film will be released and chances are the same mistakes will not be repeated, thanks to an entirely new crew and cast.  Watch this first Hulk film while you can (if you dare) because chances are it is about to become forgotten for good.<br /><br />Acting - 2.5<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 1.5<br />Story - 1.5<br />Overall - 2</p></body></html>

Hudson is pretty good considering but, I don't think her performance is Oscar worthy. When I think of all the performances over the years that got snubbed at the Oscars, it's a crime to see this young lady walk away with an Oscar for just a "good" performance. Dustin Hoffman "Toosie", Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Robert De Niro "Flawless", Richard Harris and Robert Duvall "Wrestling Earnest Hemingway" even Sean Penn in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" oh well, the list goes on and on. It's an OK story that has been done before better. Even though Hudson's vocals are good, they are not show stopping! Rent it don't buy it. 2 1/2 Stars.</p></body></html>

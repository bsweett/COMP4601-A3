<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly good."></head><body><p>I didn't have high expectations for this movie because of all the mixed reviews, but I am hungry for HD material so I watched it.  It turned out to be a pleasent surprise-realistic story, good acting, good dialogue.  However, don't expect to see a war movie with lots of combat action-most of the movie takes place during the buildup prior to the Gulf War.  Also, while the boot camp portion of the movie is good, it can't compare to Full Metal Jacket.  The HD DVD transfer is one of the better ones and the sound is top notch as well.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hauntingly beautiful!"></head><body><p>This is one of the best fantasy/drama films I've seen this year! There is graphic violence, so it's not for young children, but the adults will be drawn into the fairy tale paralleled with a gruesome battle between mountain rebels and a cruel fascist leader. A young girl is thrown into the horrors of the real world, and tasks she must do to get to a mythical kingdom. Guillermo del Toro shows immense talent of the highest caliber and I will certainly look for all his movies. This is a film you can't miss seeing. Bravo!<br /><br />Chrissy K.

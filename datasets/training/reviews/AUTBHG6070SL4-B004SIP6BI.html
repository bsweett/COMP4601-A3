<meta name="summary" content="Magic and chocolate"></head><body><p>Maybe there isn't much difference - but Vianne's is more magical than most. She spends her life as a wanderer, bringing with her chocolate recipes that descend from the Mayas, but with preparation to tempt the most refined Europeans. The story starts when she and her daughter wander into a small city in France that dates back to the middle ages. It's a walled city, filled with walled people, the kind affronted by opening a chocolate shop during Lent and nastily eager to note the mother's never-married state.<br /><br />But, with a lot of determination and a little magic, Vianne wins them over, one palate at a time. As she helps bring people together, heal rifts, and create second chances for the townspeople, one wonders why the charm doesn't work on her own life. Then, Roux (played by Johnny Depp) appears, even more of a wanderer than Vianne. Instant affinity arises between these two roamers, but instant enmity comes from the deep-rooted locals - how dare they not live lives as staid as the villagers' own?<br /><br />Based on chocolate, you just know that this has to end up as a feel-good movie; I'm not spoiling any surprises there. As in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NVT0T8">The Mistress of Spices</a>, primal forces of the kitchen bring peace and happiness in the end.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></body></html>

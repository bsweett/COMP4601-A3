<meta name="summary" content="Revenge In All of Its "Glory""></head><body><p>Munich, directed by Stephen Spielberg, is a tale of revenge--its appeal and its final lunacy. It tells the story of the tragic kidnapping/murder of eleven Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympic games in Munich, Germany, and then focuses on the team of Mossad (Israeli secret police) agents who are selected to assassinate Black Septemberist functionaries (the group responsible for Munich) in retribution.<br /><br />The movie is searing, brutal and difficult to watch. Among Spielberg's work, it has the same sense of uncompromising reality as Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List. Technically, this film is well put-together. The acting is strong throughout. The film itself reminds one of a 70's movie, with gritty footage and muted colors. It is appropriate to the subject. Thematically, this movie shows the horrible reality of dreamed-about revenge; how politicians, from on high, make decisions over tea about how we have to "show people we're strong," but how those decisions eventually translate into the ruin of people's lives, some of whom are innocent and some guilty, but always complex. Munich begins by showing us the Munich tragedy, and the audience immediately wants the terrorists responsible to pay. But, by showing us the actual mechanisims of the Israeli revenge (and suggesting that their revenge will simply lead to more Palestinian retribution, which we now know it did), we start to repent of our desire for that revenge. Also, awful though the thought may be, we gain some possible insight into the original Munich terrorists, and even, perhaps, a little sympathy.<br /><br />This is not Spielberg's finest film, but it is great. Great and heavy and not something I think I will want to watch a second time, because it is just that hard. It is essential viewing once, however, because the historical content and themes are important, present and not likely to leave us any time soon.</p></body></html>

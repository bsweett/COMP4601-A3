<meta name="summary" content="one of the best movies of the 90's, no doubt about it"></head><body><p>&quot;Seven&quot; is one of the most intelligent, thought provoking movies of the 90's. I would not, however, characterize it as &quot;realism&quot;, but rather as morbid surrealism, in the sense that the director is less concerned with getting the details of the real world right and more concerned with painting a picture of a doomed, dark, and basically evil world. This is the only performance Brad Pitt has ever given that I can stomach, and I would even go so far as to say that he does very well as the well intelligent but none too bright young detective, Mills. Morgan Freeman gives a flawless performance as Somerset, a misanthropic intellectual who is beginning to question both his occupation and the basic goodness and desirability of human life. Fincher is obviously trying to tell us something very unpleasant with this film, and yet his message is relevant and not simply intended to depress or disgust. The evil in the world is crushing when we stop ignoring it and is quite irreparable, there is no way to take back one act of malice or one atrocity, and therefore we cannot see the world as necessarily 'good'. Although he goes a little overboard with the rain and sometimes lapses into pretentiousness, most of it is subtle, masterfully done, darkly humorous at times, and chillingly believable. If you think you can't take the unrelentingly bleak atmosphere of it, wait until you see the ending, which is undoubtedly one of the most disturbing and horrific finales I've ever seen in a motion picture. This is not just a 'shocker' or an 'MTV movie', and is probably one of the best movies of the 90's. If you're a hypersensitive or depressive person, however, I would not recommend it.</p></body></html>

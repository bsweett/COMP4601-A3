<meta name="summary" content="A tough, honest look at the intertwining lives of 4 people"></head><body><p>Mike Nichols is enjoying something of a comeback. First, there was the critically-lauded Angels in America mini-series that aired on HBO and now the equally successful Closer. Together, they prove that there is an audience for smart dramas by and for adults. Nichols has a keen sense for absorbing character studies that explore, in unflinching honesty, the complex relationships between men and women. Closer shows the destructive results of infidelity.<br /><br />The characters in Closer are messed up and damaged people. They make choices that hurt others and don't think of the consequences. The dialogue is intelligent and insightful about the way people can so easily hurt each other emotionally and make the wrong choices. Mike Nichols brings a strong visual eye to the film as he successfully gives the play that it is based on a cinematic look while retaining the dialogue that has its own unique rhythm and cadence. This is due in large part to having the play's author, Patrick Marber, adapt his own work for the big screen. The result is a tough, honest look at the intertwining lives of four people.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the only extra is a music video for Damien Rice's moving song, "The Blower's Daughter."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="HULK IS A SMASH"></head><body><p>Back in the seventies television attempted to bring the story of the Incredible Hulk, Marvel Comics gargantuan green goliath to the small screen. It succeeded in telling not the story of just the monster but of the man inside, trying to find a way to stop the dangerous beast inside.<br /><br />In 2005, we had another version arrive, this time directed by Ang Lee. While Lee is noted for his storytelling ability, there was no way he was the man to bring this character to the big screen. Plotlines were change to accommodate the times and the director leaving fans with a less than favored film.<br /><br />This year director Louis Letterrier who worked with Corey Yuen on THE TRANSPORTER and directed THE TRANSPORTER 2, takes over and finally give the monster his due. With touching scenes between ill fated lovers and fight sequences that have to be seen to be believed, this film finally does the tale justice.<br /><br />The film semi-bypasses the last by giving us glimpses of the creation of the Hulk. Gamma radiated scientist Bruce Banner (Ed Norton) has no chance of stopping the release of his inner rage in the form of the giant green monster that dwells within. Somewhat of a take on the old Jekyll and Hyde story, the Hulk destroys his lab and injures the love of his life, Betty Ross (Liv Tyler).<br /><br />The Hulk also incurs the wrath of the man behind the project, Gen. "Thunderbolt" Ross (William Hurt). Warning Banner to stay away from Betty, his daughter, Banner heads out. When he realizes Ross wants what is inside to use as a weapon, he leaves.<br /><br />We learn all of this from the credits as the story unfolds with no dialogue. We end in Brazil with Banner working in a soft drink bottling plant and messaging back and forth with a "Mr.Blue" as he continues to search for a cure. But Gen. Ross gets a lead on him and sends in the troops to capture him, led by Maj. Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth).<br /><br />Blonsky fails to capture Banner/The Hulk but is fascinated with what he saw. Demanding to be put in the loop, he eventually convinces Ross to use him as a guinea pig in a process that may result in a soldier with the power to take down the Hulk.<br /><br />After Banner reunites with Betty, Ross finds him and a clash is at hand. Cornered, Banner turns once move into the Hulk on a small Virginia college campus. With soldiers and a ton of firepower behind them as well as the now enhanced Blonsky, the Hulk takes to the battlefield. It is only when he fears for Betty's safety that he finds the strength to turn the tide, running off with Betty in hand.<br /><br />Now an accomplice to Banner's attempt to find a cure, Betty aids him in an attempt to unite with Mr. Blue to find the cure. At the same time, Blonsky finds himself altering even more. When he gets Mr. Blue to provide the same sort of radiation that Banner suffered, he becomes the Abomination, a nearly unstoppable creature that perhaps only the Hulk can stop.<br /><br />The film moves back and forth on three levels. The first and most obvious is the monster whose rampages leave in their wake a ton of destruction. The second is the unrequited love story between Banner and Betty. And the last is the story of a man literally possessed who seeks release.<br /><br />The acting in this film is fantastic as two dimensional characters are given life on screen. Norton not only looks the part but turns in a performance that ranges from rage to pathos, at times showing an almost unbearable sadness in little more than a look. Tyler does a great job as well, offering a love interest that cares deeply about the man she loves. Hurt and Roth both do a commendable job as well, but leave their characters in their two dimensional forms offering little more.<br /><br />The CGI used to simulate the Hulk is top of the line. It is like a seamless painting where the entire landscape is laid before your eyes. You will believe that this creature exists. Even CGI haters have found this portrayal excellent.<br /><br />A great story, acting on top of it's game, effects that rival almost any seen and the comic book creation brought to screen in a tribute that pays homage to the original source rather than attempt to make it something it is not. You get it all with this package. And while I liked this summer's IRON MAN much more, this movie does offer escapist entertainment at its best.</p></body></html>

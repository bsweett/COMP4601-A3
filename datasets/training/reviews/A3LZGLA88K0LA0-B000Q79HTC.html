<meta name="summary" content="BOURNE TO RUN"></head><body><p>Matt Damon in his first &quot;action hero&quot; role is very good as the amnesiac Jason Bourne, who wakes up on a fishing ship not knowing anything about his past.  As in all covert agent movies, Bourne is being hunted by his superiors to eliminate him since he failed in his mission.  Damon has the right amount of boyish exuberance and masculine machismo to infuse life and credibility into his unbelievable predicament.  Franka Potente is a good foil and companion for Damon in her role as his reluctant sidekick; her transformation from coquettish flirt to persistent helper is well done.  Clive Owen in a small role as an assassin has a very good scene in which he extols the life of the undercover agent just before he bites the dust. Academy award winner Chris Cooper joins such notables as Al Pacino (Recruit), James Caan (Eraser) as the superior who will go to any lengths to tidy up a mess.  Brian Cox and Julia Stiles round out the cast, but their performances are merely acceptable and nothing other talented actors couldn't have done..maybe even better.<br />I didn't see the first version of this (with Richard Chamberlain), so I can't compare; I also haven't read Mr. Ludlum's book..but this is a well done, well directed action movie, and I look forward to the sequel.</p></body></html>

There has been so many negative reviews about this movie, I was kinda hesitant to rent it but I am glad I did, Premonition kept me interested and Bullock is outstanding as a sullen but loving wife torn apart by a tradgedy.  She plays Linda, she finds out her husband Jim has died in car crash but the next day he is still alive, and then the next day he is dead again, the film goes back and forth and I loved the ending, wow I actually saw an ending that had a message and purpose (those kind of films are hard to find!) I can't understand why everyone hates Premonition but I highly recommend checking this classy and engrossing thriller out. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

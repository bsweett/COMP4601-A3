<meta name="summary" content="The Only "Average" Matrix Movie"></head><body><p>First off, don't put this DVD in expecting The Matrix, or anything equal to "Reloaded." It is a little bland compared with it's prequels. It is much more violent, sad, and dark.<br /><br />The fight scene at the end is pretty neat, but it really failed to pack in the physcilogical blast the first two had in great measure.<br /><br />See it, but don't expect the first two. Maybe you should rent it edited, it had some content problems as well.</p></body></html>

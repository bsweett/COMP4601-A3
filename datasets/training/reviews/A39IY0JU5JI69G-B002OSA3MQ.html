They do not belong in the same class as this one.<br /><br />It's extremely entertaining, it has a deep moral base, the acting is superb, it's visually awesome, and the music is like none other you've ever heard.  (How many films have a zither background?)<br /><br />I'm not going to retell the story as there are plenty of other reviewers doing that.  I just want to add my vote to this totally satisfying film.</p></body></html>

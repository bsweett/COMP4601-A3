<meta name="summary" content="Convoluted and boring.  It was hard to stay awake."></head><body><p>The Da Vinci Code was a good book.  It kept me totally involved and I just couldn't put down.  Every page presented a new puzzle and, as a reader, I was able to make some educated guesses as well as stop and read a passage over again to make sure I understood.  I gave the book my highest rating and recommended it to all.  That's why I was anxious to see the movie.  I even bought tickets in advance for opening night.<br /><br />Fifteen minutes into the film I fell asleep.  I guess that says something.  But I did wake up and try to enjoy this flick.  I couldn't.  Actually I'm embarrassed for Ron Howard who I know to be a fine director.  And the stars, Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou, have also done better work in the past.<br /><br />The screenwriter tried to present all the puzzles that were in the book.  That was an absolutely impossible task.  On the big screen it comes out as one big jumble.  There are secret societies, a coded bank vault, a couple of different religious cults, and a question about whether Jesus and Mary Magdalene were every married and had a child. There are puzzles and puzzles and more puzzles to solve.  It's hard to tell who the good guys are.  But the main characters are some kind of geniuses because they constantly have brilliant thoughts;  and  then - poof - the latest puzzle is solved, only to be replaced by an even bigger puzzle.  There is no time to absorb all the details. The storyline is lost because of all the confusion.  Also, some of the film is in French and the titles are so big and so spread across the big screen that the concentration it takes to read them made it even harder to follow this convoluted story.  It was hard to stay awake.  I tried though.  I really wanted to like this film.  Instead I hated it.<br /><br />There have been a lot of protests by religious groups about this film.  Supposedly, it questions the very foundations of Christianity.  I don't think the Church has to worry though.  The story is so complicated that it is impossible to follow.  And besides, nobody ever said that this wasn't FICTION.<br /><br />I'm glad I saw the film.  I wanted to see for myself what all the hype is about.  I also think personal taste is developed by experimenting with a wide variety of different kinds of things.  So see it if you must.  But as far as I'm concerned, I give the film version of The Da Vinci Code my very lowest rating.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WHY DON'T YOU JUST MOVE OUT?"></head><body><p>Whether we really needed a remake of this 70s horror film, this latest resurrection of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR does have its moments of fright and frenzy.  Director Andrew Douglas keeps things moving pretty crisply.  Ryan Reynolds all buffed up from his role in BLADE 2 is not the world's greatest actor, and there are times when the usually comic Reynolds seems way over his head in trying to demonstrate his conversion from Mr. Nice Guy to Mr. Demento.  Melissa George is little better in her role as the put upon wife who tries to get Reynolds to move her and the family out of this obviously possessed house.  The remake maintains the notorious flies attacking the priest sequence, but the GET OUT segment isn't quite as overpowering as in the original.  As in the original, one has to question the validity of this supposedly "true story", but for horror fans, THE AMITYVILLE HORROR isn't all that bad, nor is it all that great.</p></body></html>

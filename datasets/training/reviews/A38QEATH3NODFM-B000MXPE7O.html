<meta name="summary" content="Interesting piece from a historical perspective, but so long."></head><body><p>I had heard mixed reviews about this film, but finally decided to check it out. It is an iteresting piece about the beginning of the CIA and the conflicts early on in the cold war. The movie is a reflection of an agents life from his beginning in the military intelligence in WWII to him signing on with the CIA.  Its done in a number of flashback, and the main film is taking place after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba back in mid april 1961.  A lot of stories to try and pick up on, lots of double crossing plots etc, but in the end I was left dissappointed. I thought the plot gave itself up earlier than expected, and then the movie just kinda ended, just fizzling out. It was a long film 2 H 49 min, and I think at the end of the film some big things happened, but just got drug out as the rest of the film did.  Just to long, lost its pizazz, and really wattered down what could have been great.  Could have been condensed to about 2 hours and still been good. Worth watching if you like a little mystery and suspense, as well as a look at that period in history, one which I was happy to see a portrayal of and lead me to do and sparked me to do a little reseach in history.</p></body></html>

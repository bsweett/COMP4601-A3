<meta name="summary" content="SLICK SOCIALIST SCREED NOT FUNNY"></head><body><p>First of all, Meryl Streep is great in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA (and hence the three stars) as the tough edit-in-chief of Runway, a top fashion mag. Andrea is hired as her first assistant and is, initially, thought of as a fat and unfashionable new hire. Which is quite ridiculous because she looks sleek and quite well dressed to me. Anyway, the moral of this film (and anyone can see this coming) is that capitalists are unhappy if rich and, to be truly happy and save your relationships and your soul, you need to be an artist, sous chef or work for a newspaper. This is just another version of the usual Hollywood liberal propaganda against competition, hard work, big business and success spun as relationships are more important than money or cute clothes. Hey, Hollywood, how about a movie where the girl WANTS to be a success and financially well-off and doesn't want to work for peanuts for a liberal rag like the New York Times. And her boyfriend understands! Now THAT would be different, wouldn't it? Some critic called this a clever, funny adaption of Lauren Weisberger's novel, when really it is only funny to socialists. I am certain that those hard-working people in the fashion industry who love their jobs and have great family lives at the same time, thank you, didn't find this slick socialist screed funny at all.</p></body></html>

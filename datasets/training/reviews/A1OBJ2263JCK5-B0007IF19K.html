<meta name="summary" content="The Best Music Biography Ever Made"></head><body><p>Doing a music film biography can be a pretty tricky thing to pull off. They can either turn out to be triumphs such as "Whats Love Got to With It" (the amazing survival story of singer, Tina Turner) or total artistic stink-bombs like Oliver Stone's "The Doors" (60's rocker, Jim Morrison). Thankfully, Taylor Hackford's Academy Award winning film, "Ray", the story of legendary soul singer/musician, Ray Charles, belongs in the former catagory. In fact it's probably one of the best music biographies ever made. The film follows Ray Charles Robinson (Jamie Foxx) from his childhood in abject poverty to his rise in musical fame & fortune. In his childhood he sees his younger brother accidentally drown (which haunts him) and shortly after he goes blind from glaucoma. Charles' strong willed mother, Della (Kerry Washington) teaches him with "tough love" ("I aint gonna be around forever, so you better learn to do it yourself") to stand on his own two feet and survive in this world. Charles takes the lessons to heart. He has an affinity for music. We follow him on a personally messy but artistically successful, life long trip, that takes him from the juke joints of the segregated, deep rural South to the most famous concert stages of the world. I think one of the reasons this film is so successful is because it presents us with the portrait of a truely conflicted man, who almost has a dual personality. On one hand it shows Ray Charles the "musical genuis" of both the stage and the studio. Here was a man who wore the word "genuis" like a crown.This was not just hype. The film shows, that he was a musical innovator (meshing gospel & blues together to create his own unique R&B style) consumate professional, a perfectionist and a tough taskmaster, who had high expectations for the musicians, that worked for him. On the other hand, the movie also presents a man with an equally messy personal life, that included heroin addiction, marital problems and numerous sexual affairs. It presents a conflicted man, who had lived a very tough life, with many personal demons, but who eventually perservered. Director Taylor Hackford does a fantastic job of telling this story in a wonderfully dynamic fashion, that keeps the viewer wanting more. But the real key for the artistic success of this film has got to be the mesmorizing, title role performance from Actor, Jamie Foxx. Foxx dosn't just merely mimic or do a slick impersonation (although he does a great job in that respect). Instead its almost as if he becomes Ray Charles himself and reveals in his performance, what the essence of the man was. This truely was the best acting performance of 2004 and Foxx roundly deserved his 'Best Actor' Oscar. Other very good performances from the film included Kerry Washington as Charles' no-nonsense mother, Sharon Warren as his first wife Aretha and Curtis Armstrong as Atlantic Records owner/producer, Ahmet Ertegun. Finally, mention should be made of the wonderfully faithful recreations of Ray Charles' legendary live shows. You really feel like your at one of his concerts. The filmmaker wisely chose to use Ray Charles' original recordings for the soundtrack and Jamie Foxx to lip-synch to. Wise choice, because only Ray Charles could make sounds like that. I wasn't much of a Ray Charles fan before I saw this movie, but I came out of the theatre tapping my toes and humming the tunes. Now, all thanks to this film, I'm trying to collect all the Ray Charles music, I can get my hands on! Great movie! Great music! Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

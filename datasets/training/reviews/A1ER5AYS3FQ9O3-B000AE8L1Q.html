<meta name="summary" content="Kevin Costner and Joan Allen in a witty, touching drama"></head><body><p>Sink down into the seat at your local theatre and savor this one, which has a story that actually seems to end all too soon, even though it isn't a short movie.<br /><br />  Joan Allen plays a woman left in charge of her daughters when her husband takes off. She doesn't handle this too well, sinking into a daze fueled by alcohol and rage. That's when her neighbor (Kevin Costner) comes in, perhaps in his best role in years. He is absolutely perfect as a man with more than a few problems himself...but the chemistry between him and Allen is undeniable and it makes for a witty, touching and very watchable movie. Even better, it isn't predictable and I sat there wanting to know even more about these people after the film ended. This is one I plan to see again - and maybe even yet again after that.</p></body></html>

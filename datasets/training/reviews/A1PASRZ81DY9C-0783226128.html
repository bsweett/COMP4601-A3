Guaranteed, Scarface is an Al Pacino's picture. There are some great acting performances: Robert Loggia, Steven Bauer, F. Murray Abraham, and Paul Shenar. But one very disappointing performance clearly goes to Michelle Pfeiffer who had no business being in that picture. I wish the story would have been constructed a lot better, given that it's from Oliver Stone, with a wishful helping hand from Francis Ford Coppola and/or Mario Puzio, perhaps Martin Scorsese. There is a point where Tony Montana was facing his own demise, but the problem is: what reason contributed to that? Also, I didn't see any more men beyond the bodyguards working for Tony Montana, let alone Frank Lopez. I need more depth in the story and in the development of the empire that Tony Montana had gained control of during his ascent to the top. Sadly, the picture robbed me of that. I really do hate being cheated by Brian De Palma, who is a somewhat gifted filmmaker, but his biggest problem is putting every aspect possible of the movie and making it all to work fluidly together. Pictures he had done come out so short of one thing or two each time: the wrong cast, the annoying camera movements, the falling-apart story, not enough developments, and so on. That's why he couldn't be revered in the same way as Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese. Talent is there, but completeness, no. Scarface is more of a cult film than of a serious film. One great thing about Scarface is the conversations in the car, which are shot superbly well. All in all, Scarface is a mess of a film.<br /><br />9/11: Scarface was a ridiculous movie when it first premiered in 1983. Since then, it has steadily gained a lot of steam as being a more appreciated film to the point of achieving its cult status. Now, Scarface remains a very overrated flick. It's easily one of the most ridiculous mess of a spectacle. Personally, I found it to be one of the best comedies I've ever seen until it pretty much fell apart after two hours of mumbo jumbo. Two things are granted. One, Al Pacino makes a remarkable transformation from the days of Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, and The Godfather to this obscenely overacted performer that is Tony Montana. It's actually a fine performance, I have to say, despite the mess. Two, the cinematography is excellent throughout that keeps the film interesting to look at. I really enjoy the style, and of course, Brian De Palma is an expert in this area, as always. Naturally, Miami Vice the television show would soon later come and make an indelible mark on Miami. There is also a very, very similar but better stylized film called Manhunter that would rival Scarface for aesthetic quality, and the former wins the contest hands down. Let's go back to the mess, and analyze it a bit for a minute. The plot has the audience, believing that some immigrant from Cuba with obvious criminal past yet with zero connections can rise from the gutters to drug lord of Miami within mere months. Then, it all comes crashing down because he can't control his coke problem. So, the ending has to be done with a bang via Sam Peckinpah route. Looking at the cast, although young and just started out, sometimes I wonder if everybody is saying, "Are the director and the writer out of their minds?" repeatedly over and over throughout the filming. By looking at the end result, it sure looks like it. Anyone including me not buying Scarface for a second, they would all agree that Michelle Pfeiffer stunk up every scene she appears in. Then, we have to ask..."What did anyone ever see in her?" She has been a terrible actress for so many years, and it's almost impossible to think of a film that she was at least decent in. All in all, what a mess of a film. It would have been nice to see some realism and comprehensibility in Scarface. I am dropping the rating of the film from `7' to `5'.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="so this is all that we've been waiting for..."></head><body><p>Since the Alien and Predator series ended, we all knew that there would be an "Alien vs. Predator".  But who knew the average viewer (i.e. me) would find so many mistakes...<br /><br />-Alexa's "warrior" marking on her left cheek disappears in overhead shots.<br />-When Alexa and the Predator are running from the explosion, across the whaling station, her "shield" changes hands.<br />-The full moon for October 2004 would be on the 28th, not the 10th.<br />-The large pulley and winch setup for lowering equipment and people down the ice tunnel completely disappears when the equipment sled comes rocketing back out. If it was in place, the sled would have slammed right into it.<br />-Icebreakers have round prows, not angled ones.<br />-The film gives confusing and inconsistent accounts of the geology of the area around the pyramid. It is supposedly buried under 2,000 feet of ice on an island, yet the pure-ice tunnel leading down to it begins at sea-level (as proved by the existence of the whaling station at the upper end). The whaling station is thus supposedly built on ice instead of rock; this is a ludicrous proposition as it would only be constructed in a region where ice melted enough each summer to allow whaling ships to dock. Anything built on ice that thaws significantly each year would not last 100 years. This arrangement also places the pyramid and a large amount of ice below sea-level; the buoyancy and natural flow of the ice pack makes this highly unlikely and not is not something that could be accurately described as an island in the first place. Further confusion is caused by the scene at the end of the film in which a large tank falls into the water and plunges hundreds of feet towards an unseen ocean floor, supposedly directly offshore.<br />-The story is set in October (summertime in Antarctica). It should therefore be daylight on the surface, and yet it's dark as night.<br />-When the Predator and Alexa turn around after the whaling station falls into the ground, the shot of them is reversed (notable by the marking and pressure tubes on the predators helmet).<br />-The second Predator is killed by an Alien when his head is punctured by the Alien's inner mouth. When the shot changes and the Predator tilts his head back there is no wound.<br />-Alexa is wearing only a thin sweater (and no hat) after the Alien burns her jacket, yet she doesn't even shiver while outdoors in Antarctica.<br />-The captions show the icebreaker approaching the island/pyramid from the Ross Ice Shelf. The island is in fact on the opposite side of the Antarctic continent.<br />-After the collapse of the whaling town, the "T" shape on the Predator's mask is backwards.<br />-Despite detailed satellite imagery of the pyramid, the expedition is surprised to find a whaling station at their intended drilling site. They must have missed this, as well as the large ship-worth bay it was undoubtedly located on: despite their haste, they choose a more remote anchorage that required a land journey over some significant elevation.<br />-Sebastian refers to "the Long Count" while describing a calendar that he refers to as "Aztec". The Long Count was a feature of the Mayan calendar system; the Aztec calendar, although based on the Mayan, didn't use the Long Count.<br />-It is said by one of the team that the whaling station is directly above the pyramid. However a geographical survey (as well as the obvious in-story shots) show that the ice tunnel slopes gently down towards the pyramid entrance, therefore not on top at all.<br />-Graeme Miller's description of the aurorae as being caused by protons and electrons in the atmosphere is inaccurate. The aurorae are caused by the interaction of oxygen ions with oxygen molecules in the ionosphere, leading to chemiluminescene. However, as a chemical engineer, his knowledge of atmospheric photochemistry may be expected to be somewhat rusty.<br />-When Alexa Woods is climbing the Lho La ice fall in Nepal, she's about 10 body-lengths from the top edge. From the moment she answers the phone she reaches the top in about six steps. You can't take steps longer then your body.<br />-When Alexa is climbing the Lho La ice fall in Nepal, you can see a overview of the edge where is climbing to. There is nowhere a helicopter too be seen, yet after 30 second (duration of the phone call) the helicopter manages to land, turn off the engine (spinning down rotors takes much more than 30 seconds), and let Maxwell Stafford out of the helicopter and walk towards the edge to meet Alexa.<br />-During the first battle, when the Alien falls to the ground after the Predator kicks it through a pillar, a wire can be seen holding its tail up.<br />-The legs of the practical and computer-generated Aliens don't correspond. The practical ones have human-like joints and feet, while the CG versions have an extra joint at the ankle and much longer toes.<br />-When the first-killed Predator is thrown to the ground, its extended wrist blades bend when they hit the ground, revealing that they are actually made of rubber.<br />-The characters correctly predict that the walls will move every 10 minutes, because the Aztec did everything in multiples of 10. However, the Aztec would not have known how long a minute is.<br />-When Alexa and the Predator are shooting up the tunnel, she isn't wearing the Alien head on her hand. She is clearly holding on with both hands. As they are thrown on the surface, the head reappears.<br />-The Predator cuts off the tip of the Alien's tail, spewing green acidic blood, and then tosses him through a column and into another room. As the Alien flies in slow motion, you can see that there is no blood on his stump, but immediately after, it's covered again.<br />-Sebastian erroneously says that the Aztec calendar was metric (based on 10). It was in fact vigesimal (based on 20) with twenty days in 18 "months".<br /><br />Now, if I can find this many mistakes, then you know that director Paul W.S. Anderson has f*cked up once again.</p></body></html>

His vision of Richard Yates' novel is a character study that, I think, was much maligned by most. Certainly, it's not a million laffs; rather a study of life as it is (or was...and still is). This could've been just another sad soap opera, but what sets it aside is the superlative acting of Winslet and di Caprio, and excellent support from Michael Shannon, Kathy Bates & Dylan Baker. I will not blab away the plot, as others did, but paying attention to the characters can only make you marvel in the talent displayed. I guess I just chose to pay attention; maybe I could relate to the angst. Critics don't have to deal with these things. REAL people often do... Dealing with these people is no different than dealing with other traumatic experiences. I thought it was profound, and thoughtful, and beautifully explored.</p></body></html>

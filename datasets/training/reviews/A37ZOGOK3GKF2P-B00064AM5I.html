I'm not much into sports, and I remember "Any Given Sunday" seemed to go on longer than the entire football season.  Anywho, sport movies seem to work better as comedies.  "Caddyshack" and "Happy Gilmore" made golf actually look interesting and fun.  "The Bad News Bears" and "Mr. 3000" made baseball fun.  Even "Field of Dreams" made the sport seem spiritual as a movie.  This particular film is funny.  Great comic performances from all the cast.  The film breezes through nicely.  There's even a couple of romances.  Some good plot twists and fun, fun, fun.  Now imagine if t he boys from South Park would have helmed this project...</p></body></html>

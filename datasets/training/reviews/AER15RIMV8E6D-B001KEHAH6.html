<meta name="summary" content="Another Awesome Chick-Flick!!!"></head><body><p>I think this is a really good funny movie! Jennifer Garner is extremely sexy in her role! She plays a woman named Jenna who wakes up the day after her 13th birthday party, and she's 30! She's confused at first, but soon adapts to the idea. Her childhood friend named Matt has become engaged to someone else. She works for her favorite magazine, Poise. Jenna tries to track down Matt, and realizes that they've stopped being best friends. She tries to help make everything right. If you love comedy and chick flicks, you'll love 13 GOING ON 30!!!</p></body></html>

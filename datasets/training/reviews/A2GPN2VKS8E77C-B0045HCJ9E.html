<meta name="summary" content="Murder. Espionage. Romance. Intrigue. Classic Thriller From The Master Of Suspense."></head><body><p>What do you get when you combine Cary Grant, Academy Award winner Eva Marie Saint, veteran stage and film actor James Mason and a well-written script with murder, espionage, romance, intrigue & some of the greatest chase scenes in cinema history? Why, it's..."Elementary." You get "North By Northwest," of course. Pay attention to the movie from the beginning, otherwise you'll be lost in the complex and amazing labyrinth of the movie with one of the most-literally-cliffhanging scenes in film. Hitchcock was a master at his art, and with this corker of a suspense thriller, it's easy to see why he was named The Master Of Suspense. Martin Landau and Leo G. Carroll also star in this witty cat-and-mouse thriller.  Everyone in the cast and crew was wonderful. If you haven't seen either this or any of Hitch's other movies, you're in for a real treat. This film is Not Rated.</p></body></html>

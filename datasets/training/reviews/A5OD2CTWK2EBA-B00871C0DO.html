For it being made in the 80's , I believe it was 1980 it has the best Human - werewolf transformation. The action is good the story does not get boring and it will keep you up and on your toes, never bored. the acting is very good the gore is there, not like dawn of the dead 1978 gore but its bloody. It is without a doubt a classic werewolf movie, just a classic in general and worth the buy and especially if you are a fan of horror/cult type of movies its a must to have. To anyone who rates it low if I was you I wouldnt take there but take the word of the people who gave it 4 or 5 stars cause they are not lying. Just an excellent movie.</p></body></html>

In brining a 40 year old TV show to the big screen, the powers that be brought Agents 86 and 99 into the modern era and gave them more detailed treatment.  Steve Carell brings back the kind of playing it straight humor that Don Adams did so well.  Maxwell Smart is a terrific analyst who has worked like crazy to become a field agent, but has been kept from it for a variety of reasons, not the least is his superb ability as an analyst.  Ann Hatheway is a modern woman and is more disinterested in 86 than Barbara Feldon's version ever was.  Terrence Stamp is a positively diabolical Siegfried and the humor associated with him happens around him (mostly).  Bernie Kopell's Siegfried was written with a touch of villainy and a lot more humor.  However, putting together a feature film requires more substance for a story than a half-hour sitcom.  (Kopell does make a cameo appearance so watch for him!).<br /><br />The plot of the story matters little except for the jokes it helps to set up.  That was the point of the TV show, too.  Alan Arkin is quite good as Chief and the rest of the cast does their work with a nice touch.  Dwayne Johnson pulls of the ultimate Agent 23 deftly.  I also enjoyed Masi Oka and Nate Torrence as Bruce and Lloyd.  Their line about getting the super strong thread by milking spiders is unforgettable.  Bill Murray has a nice cameo as Agent 13 that is a wonderful homage to the original show.<br /><br />You can also watch the movie in "comedy enhancement mode" were the alternate lines not used in the film are provided.  Some are funny, many are not.  I saw why most were not in the movie although I enjoyed the lines about the viola.<br /><br />Anyway, cotton candy is fun to eat in the way this movie is fun to watch.  Maybe we can get another one with more of Bruce and Lloyd and Hymie (Patrick Warburton).  Yes, I saw the straight to DVD story they did with those two, but I would like something that actually works better than that little thing.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI</p></body></html>

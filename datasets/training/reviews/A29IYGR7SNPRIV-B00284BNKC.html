So many (too many) books and films try (and ultimately fail) to give us a sense of our drug culture, but this film succeeds on every level. Its take on the insidious presence of drugs, of one sort of another, in all our lives, sounds a loud cautionary note. And Hubert Selby, the author, has always taken a very hard, penetrating look at the views around him. This time (perhaps because of the film desecretion of his fine book Last Exit to Brooklyn) perhaps his involvement played a significant part in keeping the film so on track. <p>With stunning performances by the entire cast, especially Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto, this is a scarily accurate view of how drugs, of whatever kind, can creep in and overtake our lives. A film about desperation, loss, and illusions, you must see Requiem if you have any interest in (a) an outstanding bit of filmmaking and (b) how all-too-easy it is to follow the rabbit down the hole.</p></body></html>

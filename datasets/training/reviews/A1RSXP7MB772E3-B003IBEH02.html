<meta name="summary" content="Every fathers worst nightmare."></head><body><p>The Lovely Bones is a movie directed by Peter Jackson, and though his fans are varied, I would say most of them are males. So when I say that this movie is highly anticipated, it is by an entirely different crowd waiting impatiently for this movie. And the ultimate reason there is so much complaining, and unending speculation. But, the fans of the novel do seem to find it appropriate and worthy, and have attempted to counter the negativity of his LOTR's fans.<br /><br />But saying that, I am not one to walk into a movie with the designs that it should be a certain way, and that my expectations must be met. I judge a film's enjoyment and artistic value only on what is presented, and how it is presented, and also by the posibilities made by the cast and crew.<br /><br />The Lovely Bones is wonderfully filmed, and it is at times presented like a pretty scrap book of heavenly ideas. I felt the drama of this movie played down by the tone sometimes, and also, I felt that the focus of the film lacking in solid direction. There are chilling moments in this film that deserve wide respect, and they lead to horrendous events, that have been, thankfully, unshot. The power of visuals are very much so in their absence.<br /><br />I only heard after seeing this film that it was based on a popular book. First thing I thought was how hard it must have been to write about the terrible events in this book. It is a film that held me in disgust and suspense throughout. I had strong feelings throughout this film and wanted justice to be had.<br /><br />I felt Peter Jackson did a creative job here, telling a difficult story with the talents we all know he has. I had a front row seat, and that usually makes me car sick, but the landscape-like scenes and the ease that it was filmed kept me from becoming sick. I thought that Mark Walberg had powerful moments in this film.<br /><br />The special effects are criticized for having been too fantastic, yet I thought it was in good form with the way Peter Jackson had set the tone. It was never too serious, and I felt that the tone was set with the creativity shared between father and daughter while making wooden ship-in-a-bottles.<br /><br />But my problem is the selfishness, or rather the absolute overthinking done by the characters of this movie. Rather than being driven by one need: such as revenge or absolution, I felt that the Susie was driven by many needs, yet only time enough to settle here fanatical obsession to experience a first kiss. The father's side of the story robed me of any joy. I felt misery on his behalf. I can't remember a character that has been wronged like this and not deserved it.<br /><br /> I recommend this film for those who haven't read the book as well as those that have because it is a good movie.</p></body></html>

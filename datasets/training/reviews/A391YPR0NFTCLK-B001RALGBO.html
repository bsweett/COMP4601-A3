<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie-- Only If You Let It Be"></head><body><p>This movie, to me, is great! I loved all of it. It is a throwback to old disaster movies of 70s and I think it really works. I loved the plot even though it was kinda dumb but it worked for the movie. The acting was bad but you don't go see a disaster movie for acting or a lpot you see it for the effects and thats what you get and they are truely amazing! I loved this movie, every bit of it, turn your brain off, don't think about it and you have a great time!<br /><br />Other movies that are totally underrated!<br /><br />"Catwoman"<br /><br />"The Exorcist: The Beginning"<br /><br />"Van Helsing"<br /><br />"The Village"<br /><br />"Alien vs. Predator"<br /><br />These might not be great movies but you can sure have a lot of fun with them...I know I did!</p></body></html>

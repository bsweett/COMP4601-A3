We look at images of people frozen in a happier time before a certain personal tragedy has befallen them, blissfully unaware of the fate that awaits them - and, for a brief moment at least, we sense what it must be like to be God and realize what a burden that must be.  This feeling of prophetic omniscience haunts the audience all throughout "Grizzly Man," a morbidly fascinating documentary about a man who is quite literally devoured by his own obsession.  This is a film that puts its audience into the position of modern day Cassandras - looking on in helpless horror as the subject moves inexorably towards his bitter fate - grimly aware that there is not a single thing we can do to stop the inevitable from happening.<br /><br />Timothy Treadwell earned notoriety and even celebrity status as a conservationist who, for thirteen summers, lived amongst a group of grizzly bears in Alaska.  While there, he made "friends" with much of the wildlife in the area, filming his experiences in an effort to draw attention to the plight of these creatures at the hands of poachers and hunters.  However, in September, 2003, the bizarre idyll came to a tragic end when Treadwell and his girlfriend were attacked and eaten by a hungry bear.  The film, written, directed and narrated by famed moviemaker Werner Herzog, is made up of footage Treadwell himself shot of his adventures in the wilderness combined with interviews with people who knew him or were somehow involved in the post mortem activities.<br /><br />Herzog makes it clear from the outset that Treadwell was always a controversial figure, one who was beloved by fellow conservationists, but treated with, at best, skepticism and, at worst, hostility and scorn by others less favorable to his cause.  What we see of the man is alternately inspiring and disturbing.  We admire his strong convictions and fearlessness in the face of danger, yet can't help but detect traces of mental illness or at least childish naivete in many of his actions.  He is a man constantly testing limits, crossing boundaries and teasing fate.  He is often shown interacting with these wild animals with that same air of condescension and sentimentality most people reserve for their benign pets.  He names them, talks to them, scolds them, instructs them, cries over them - seemingly convinced that there is some sort of interspecies communication taking place between him and them.  We somehow expect someone this knowledgeable about the realities of wildlife to be less susceptible to the temptation - that seems to overcome even the most rational of us - of viewing animals in such intensely anthropomorphic terms.  Yet, Treadwell was, apparently, unable to separate himself, either emotionally or psychologically, from the animals he cohabitated with, and he wound up paying the ultimate price for that weakness.<br /><br />As we watch Treadwell's interactions with the animals and listen to the often self-aggrandizing commentary he provides on his own role in the situation, we get the sense that he saw himself, paradoxically, as both a messiah figure for the grizzlies and a sinner who needed to find his own salvation through them.  His experiences with the bears seem as much a way of achieving a meaning and purpose for his own life as it is a way of saving them from the threats of an ever-encroaching and hostile civilization.<br /><br />As a master director himself, Herzog is also fascinated by Treadwell's techniques as a filmmaker.  He shows how Treadwell, ever the perfectionist and showman, would often film seemingly spontaneous scenes a dozen or more times until he was happy that the final take was the one that would show him off to his best advantage. He would even consciously cover up the presence of the cameraman (or woman) in an effort to make it appear as if he were truly alone on these expeditions.<br /><br />Was Treadwell an environmentalist hero, a self-promoting opportunist or a victim of a bizarre mental illness that allowed him to believe that he was genuinely connecting with the bears on a psychic level - if not a bear himself?  "Grizzly Man" raises far more questions than it answers - but, then again, that is what a truly great documentary should be all about.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Slow movie about hope..."></head><body><p>This movie is about finding redemption.  Hanks plays hitman Mike Sullivan, who knows that what he does is not going to save his soul.  He is hoping his son will not follow his footsteps though.  After his oldest son witnesses his fathers work, his wife and younger son  are killed, although it was supposed to be his older son who was to be killed.  Retribution is sought and Sullivan recruits his son to help him carry out a plan to do so.  All the while, Sullian is growing closer to his son and realizing that his estrangement was due to his fear that he would grow up like himself.  The movie is paced slow and it is dark.  The scenery and the sets are detailed beautifully for the period and Newman and Hanks give very solid performances.  There are a lot of Father son dichodomies in this movie.  Four different relationships span the plot and it shows many different character reactions and behaviors.  This is not to be compared with Godfather or any other mobster movie.  There is not a lot of action, but there is enough.  Be patient and you will not be disappointed.</p></body></html>

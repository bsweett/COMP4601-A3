With Wes Craven's reputation as a horror genre director with the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series and then the "Scream" films, I thought this would be a stalker flick, but the previews looked interesting.  Craven has proven he can change pace as with Meryl Streep in "The Music of the Heart" and "Red Eye" is a taut suspense drama.  I loved the compression of having most of the film set in the tight confines of an airplane.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams is certainly one of Hollywood's new bright lights.  The daughter of a Canadian truck driver, she's come a long way from "The Hot Chick" & "Mean Girls" to Ryan Gosling's love interest in "The Notebook" & Owen Wilson's love interest in "The Wedding Crashers."  As hotel administrator Lisa Reisert, McAdams demonstrates both professional confidence and personal vulnerability as she worries about her father.<br /><br />As Jackson Rippner, a Jack the Ripper pun, Irish actor Cillian Murphy is entrancing.  At first convincing as a flirtatious stranger, we soon see him metamorphize into a dangerous and committed terrorist.  With his appearances in "Batman Begins" as the creepy villain Dr. Jonathan Crane and as the peasant boy who loves "The Girl With the Pearl Earring," he's shown the range as an actor that was glimpsed in "28 Days."  In short, he's the kind of guy you love to hate.<br /><br />Brian Cox who was so wonderfully seedy in "The Bourne Identity" & "The Bourne Supremacy" and also played in "The Ring" & "Troy" does a good although not very demanding part of the father who for most of the movie sits in a recliner watching TV.  Then when the action hits at the end, he gets knocked out and lies unconscious.  He looks like a daddy!<br /><br />A couple of other wonderful cameos are also part of this film.  As the hotel clerk filling in while Lisa Reisert attends her grandmother's funeral, Jayma Mays plays Cynthia.  She does a wonderful job of looking confused, trying to do the right thing even when she doesn't quite know what to say or which computer button to push, and then saving the day by getting the Homeland Security secretary out of his room at the Lux Atlantic before the big blow.  It's the kind of break a young actress dreams of & Craven has been very generous in her screen time.<br /><br />Another lovely cameo is Angela Paton who plays the Nice Lady who gets a book from Lisa, only to have Lisa write a message in it & Jackson to steal it back.  Paton is one of those actresses you know you've seen, first appearing in "Dirty Harry" in 1971 & having played in Flatliners (1990), "Groundhog Day" (1993) & as Grandma in "American Wedding" (2003).  She doesn't have a major part, but she fills her screen time with depth.<br /><br />I found the tension in the film to unwind at just the right intervals.  The hotel explosion did look a bit fake (computer generated), but the mix of humor and tension work well in this charmer.  It is not an ambitious plot, but what it does is done extremely well.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

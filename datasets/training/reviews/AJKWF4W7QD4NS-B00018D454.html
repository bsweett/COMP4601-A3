<meta name="summary" content="Not as bad as has been said"></head><body><p>The controversial remake of the classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre may not be without it's flaws, but it isn't as bad as it has been reputed to be since it's release.  While the remake doesn't live up to the sheer terror and gritiness of the original film, it succeeds on it's own as a more than solid horror film that is better than almost every other horror movie to have been released in the last few years.  There are many similarities between this version and the original, most of all the storyline.  Five young people (led by Jessica Biel) on a back Texas road pick up a hitchiker.  Followed by a series of chilling events, they find themselves all picked off one by one by a chainsaw wielding maniac named Leatherface.  Rookie film director Marcus Nispel and producer Michael Bay (director of Pearl Harbor, Armageddon, The Rock, and the Bad Boys films) used the much bigger budget to their advantage giving Leatherface a bigger family (including Full Metal Jacket favorite R. Lee Ermey), plenty of blood and gore, and enough lingering suspense to make the film worth watching.  The gallows humor featured in the original isn't here, and the film is too long for it's own good, but it still manages to stand alone as a creepy and suspenseful horror film, even though it doesn't come close to matching Tobe Hooper's original masterpiece.  This Platinum Series Special Edition is packed with plenty of extras that will satisfy even jaded horror buffs, and is definitely worth the extra cash.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock Perfection"></head><body><p>I think that this is one of Hitchcock's most popular and entertaining films.  I truly adore Jimmy Stewart, and his work with Hitchcock is just magical (Rope, Vertigo, and the Man Who Knew Too Much).  Grace Kelly IS the Hitchcock blonde.  Their dysfunctional relationship is believable and well acted.  Thelma Ritter stands out, even among these two, to be a transcendent comic character.<br /><br />The story itself is still so intriguing: a voyeur witnesses a crime, but has trouble convincing others because he is prying on his unsuspecting neighbors.  I think reality t.v. proves just how much interest we all have in the lives of others.  The timeless storyline is so well acted and cleverly presented; it is difficult NOT to like this film.<br /><br />The DVD is quality, but it is obvious that the extensive reconstruction work used on Vertigo is not present here.  All the extras make it a must have.  For Hitchcock fans it is a must.  So indulge your voyeuristic curiosities ... Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I Walk The Line"></head><body><p>"Walk The Line" is a powerful portrayal to the human spirit, love, and the struggle of the crazy dream. The movie in a sense is a great bio-music pic... much like "Ray" or "Beyond The Sea". But, this movie will not just make fans of Johnny Cash but will appeal to, all movie-goers . The story focuses mainly on the love affair Cash had with June Carter rather than a 'bunch of facts' that relate to Cash's life.<br /><br />The love affair with Cash is not only interesting but, it is relatable and unbelievable sweet. Reese Witherspoon got a well-deserved Oscar for her performance- she gives perhaps the most honest portrayal ever done on June Carter Cash- a smart, intelligent, family orriented women- (which Reese also is).<br /><br />Phoenix looks the part- but in this movie he actually acts the part too- and deserved an Oscar for his performance. The performance is so authentic it is hard to seperate the man from the legend- and the actor from the man. He is GREAT and gives the PERFORMANCE that Cash himself would be proud of.<br /><br />What is even more amazing is the music-both actors sing their songs and REALLY well- the music fits in well with the period and done in chroniological order that makes sense- unlike most bio-music pics.<br /><br />The movie is definately one of the movies that is "must see" the movie is heartwarming, heart-breaking,and amazingly humorous at times...like when Johnny is a rut financially, loses his car, and is on drugs- he walks for miles to June Carter's house a ritual he calls his "June Carter love walk." Both actors give great performances and enduringly sweet. This is definately a movie I'll watch more than once and one to have in your collection!!! Hit the buy now button- and remember to WALK THE LINE!!!</p></body></html>

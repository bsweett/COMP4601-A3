<meta name="summary" content="OLD-SCHOOL ACTION FLICK DELIVERS!!"></head><body><p>It's rare when an exciting theatrical poster doesn't even begin to convey the true action of the film it's advertising! UNSTOPPABLE is old-school filmmaking notched to the nth degree.  Instead of photorealistic computer effects, director Tony Scott uses real railroad tracks, engines and cars for the high-speed race against time to stop a runaway train laden with deadly, volatile chemicals heading for Scranton, PA.  It's all "inspired by actual events."  Denzel Washington is the veteran engineer and Chris Pine is the novice conductor and it's up to them to resolve personal differences and bring this impending epic disaster to a halt.  Rosario Dawson costars.  The Blu-ray is loaded with interesting and watchable extras.</p></body></html>

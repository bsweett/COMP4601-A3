<meta name="summary" content="The Green Mile"></head><body><p>This is one of my favorite movies.  What makes that even funnier was that I just saw the whole thing for the first time a few days ago.  Before I would always catch it on tv an hour or so in and never saw the beginning.  Now that I've had the chance to see the complete movie, I love it even more.<br /><br />Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is a guard in the Cold Mountain Penitentiary working on death row.  Also known as the "Green Mile" because of its faded lime colored tile, it is a ward that doesn't hold too many prisoners.  We first meet Paul when he is in a nursing home and largely the movie is  him reminiscing about a particular summer.  A summer in which he had a really bad urinary tract infection and a summer in which he meets John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan).<br /><br />Coffey is a towering hulk of a man who has been sent to the prison to await his fate at the electric chair.  Accused of raping and killing two young girls there is something a little strange about this man.  Seemingly gentle he has a way about him that is almost childlike.  The guards and Paul soon discover that there is more to him than meets the eye.  Especially when he starts performing miracles.<br /><br />Not everyone likes him though.  A young guard who has friends in high places, Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison) makes life terrible for all in the ward, even his fellow guard Brutus Howell (David Morse) and a few others.  He does make a friend in Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter) a fellow inmate when he heals his remarkably smart pet mouse Mr. Jingles.  There is another inmate on the ward as well.  The incredibly brutal and psychotic Wild Bill Wharton (Sam Rockwell) who doesn't like Coffey and has a sinister past.<br /><br />Paul must run the ward the best he can but with all these personalities and conflicting emotions makes it tough.  Especially when Percy commits the unforgivable and endangers everyone.  With this and a daring healing involving Coffey, things are not very calm on the Green Mile.<br /><br />All the actors in this movie did amazing jobs.  Hanks plays a believable sympathetic guard and it is easy to relate with him.  Coffey is a sad character but there is something very special about him and actor Duncan plays him very convincingly.  About the best actor in this film though would be Hutchinson for his portrayal of Percy.  He did such a wonderful job I actually hated Percy and wanted to slug the little jerk.  A close second was Rockwell's interpretation of the crazy Wild Bill.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the music in this film.  Most of it was instrumental but I've always been a fan of the song "Dancing cheek to cheek". All of the music fit in well with the scenes in which it was played.  Another part of the movie was the special effects.  There weren't a whole lot of them, but what was used was tastefully done and entirely believable. They had a great interpretation of Coffey expelling the "toxins" he took out of people.<br /><br />I should include a bit of a warning about some of the scenes in this movie.  Because it is a movie about death row in a prison, there are execution scenes.  One of them is especially horrific and children might not be able to handle it.  There is also violence done to a mouse (no animals harmed in real life of course) which could be disturbing for younger children.  In addition to this, some of the paranormal aspects could be frightening for younger crowds as well.<br /><br />Wonderful movie filled with great actors and performances.  Out of all the Stephen King movies out there, this is definitely one of the better ones.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2010</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="So now we see the clients ..."></head><body><p>Hostel II is a decent horror flick, but can't quite hold up to its predecessor, the first Hostel movie.  In Hostel we followed male college students, in Hostel II we follow some female students who are led astray by female model, promising them the vacation of their lives.  After a strange run in on a train, they are invited to a big party where one of their numbers immediately goes missing.  Searching for their missing companion, the rest fall into terrible peril at the hands of the men who have paid to kill them in any way they wish to do.<br /><br />I think what makes Hostel II weak is the fact that they chose to delve into the personalities and identities of the men (and women) who are the clients, the ones who pay to do the killing.  It seemed more sinister when the clients were left as a mystery.  Hostel II showed their weaknesses and not the nature of them that leads them to sign up for something so sinister as a trouble free murder.  The plot is much thinner than in the first movie.<br /><br />The ending to Hostel II is its strong point, but I can't give away too much of that.  Suffice to say it has a good feeling, though again it doesn't compare to the ending of the first Hostel movie.  Overall, I would rate the first Hostel as a purchase and Hostel II as a rental, if you're interested.  There is some gore and a few tense scenes, but it seemed more "forced" than the first movie.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

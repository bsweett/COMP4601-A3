As the crazed Frenchy speed demon, his effeminate stereotype crushes France and Ricky Bobby, the Will Ferrell - All-American NASCAR Driver alter ego with a sloppy kiss.  The rest of the film is dumb Southerners uttering stupid clich&eacute;'s in standard hate-redneck speech.  You think I'm kidding.  No, this film is one more blast at your average red state, Bush loving, and dumb gum chewing, big boob, blonde Southern folks. That is the way those Liberals in Hollywood at their cocktail parties lambaste the suckers that buy the tickets.<br /><br />One more note, the arcade game look of the races and crashes has gone beyond clay models.  Still, these special effects that look something like Madden Football, leaves me cold.</p></body></html>

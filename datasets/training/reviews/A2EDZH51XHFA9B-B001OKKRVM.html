(Which, in my mind, still doesn't fit with Morgan Freeman's narration about the penguins mating for one year and then moving on to different partners. There's some joke to be made here about Jesse Helms at a swingers' party, but I'll leave it to you.) Still, if you're one of the twenty or thirty people in America who has not yet seen this film, treat yourself.<br /><br />Narrated by the fine Mr. Freeman, the film follows a tribe of emperor penguins on a trek from the sea to their breeding ground, seventy miles into the blistering winds of the Antarctic, and the rather extreme reaches they have to go to in order to ensure the continuation of their species. There are a lot of shots of penguins being silly. There are a lot of shots of oh-so-cute baby penguins. There's a lot of shots that simply reek of anthropomorphism (Freeman narrates, and Jacquet shows, hundreds of penguins huddled together for survival-- it's cold in the middle of winter in Antarctica-- but you just know at least half the audience is looking at it and seeing either a sixties love-in or a football huddle.) This is a movie that is unafraid to manipulate your emotions, and equally unafraid to let you know that it knows it's manipulating your emotions, and furthermore, that it doesn't care you know. But it works, one way or the other, and March of the Penguins raises itself from basic nature documentary to, well, feature film. (Which is why most National Geographic documentaries end up on the National Geographic channel instead of as feature films.)<br /><br />Go see it. You will like it, even if you realize how brazen it's being in trying to get you to like it. And, when you're walking out of the theater covered in popcorn detritus, pause for a moment to think about what could have been, and bless whatever exec said "axe the talking penguins. How about we get Morgan Freeman to narrate it?" *** ?</p></body></html>

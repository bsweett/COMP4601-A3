Gwyneth Paltrow gives a shreakingly one note performance, whining and pouting, and maybe smiling once or twice in a role that reeks of self-absorption.  Only Jake Gylenhaal salvages his role, and Hope Davis is as annoying as Paltrow.  Anthony Hopkins looks like he has gas, and the movie is about as exciting as reading an algebra text.  Yuck!</p></body></html>

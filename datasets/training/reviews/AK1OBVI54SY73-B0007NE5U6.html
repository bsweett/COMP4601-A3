<meta name="summary" content="Both Are Good Films."></head><body><p>I really was worried how well I would like the second movie of this plot. I really enjoyed the first one and wanted to enjoy this one as well. It took me awhile but I decided while at the movie place to get the film and I must say I was relieved that this film was just as witty and interesting as the first one. Bridget is a cool character that you just have to watch and she doesn't fail on the second story on her. It's a romance comedy in all its glory and even though I usually find romance comedies silly and overdone at times I find both Bridget Jones great and original.<br /><br />I love the little quiz they give throughout the film as well that makes the movie fun- and that is what this movie is fun and just a film you watch with your friends or when you just need to lift your spirits.<br /><br />PS- Daniel and Mark fight again- don't miss it it's hilarious.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A lethal night's work - more like 4 1/2 stars"></head><body><p>Michael Mann's slick, ultra violent thriller "Collateral" serves as a worthy coming out party for the non comedic talents of Jamie Foxx.  Foxx playing ambitious L.A. cabbie Max Durocher becomes an unwitting accomplice, at gunpoint, to smooth and unruffled hitman Vincent played by a grey coiffed Tom Cruise.<br /><br />Cruise has been employed by a drug kingpin known as Felix who is about to be indicted by federal prosecutors.  Cruise's task is to assassinate five witnesses that have been hidden by both the FBI and L.A.P.D.  He is using Foxx and his cab to chauffeur him his various assignments.  When his first victim falls through a 4th floor window onto the roof of Foxx's cab the reality of the frightful adventure commences.<br /><br />Prior to Foxx's initial brush with Cruise he had picked up federal attorney the beautiful Jada Pinkett Smith.  Their innocent but somewhat hard to believe conversation and encounter,<br /><br />will have major relevance to the later developement of the plot.<br /><br />Mann's direction keeps the flick moving at a crisp pace. The camera work is effective in accomplishing this especially in the frenetic gun battle in the night club.  The interplay between Cruise and Foxx is superb and heightens the character developement to make them both believable and sympathetic.  The musical score is quite good as well.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""American History X": Providing Insight into Hate"></head><body><p>From an incredibly unknown director, "American History X" is a powerful film that brings the audience face-to-face with white supremacy.  But this is not the easily dismissed, ignorant white supremacy that is represented in so many films these days.  Rather, it is white supremacy in the mind of an extremely intelligent young man played by Edward Norton.  While anyone with reasonable intelligence can see the holes in Derek Vinyard's logic, the arguments themselves are delivered with powerful and forceful eloquence that is absolutely shocking.  Norton's performance is riveting; I am constantly amazed at the depth of his acting ability.  One is able to go from hating him to being moved by him to absolutely routing for him-all in the same film. <p>The movie is extremely graphic and moving.  "American History X" is not your typical film about racism and violence.  It manages to emerge from the rubble and provide a positive message for those of us who are left to deal with the world.  Hate is learned; one can see that in the lives of these two neo-Nazis.  But it can also be forgotten.  The most important thing, however, is to never learn to hate in the first place.  Not only does this film provide insight into the making of a racist, it empathizes with those who are unwittingly caught up in the false logic the white supremacists sell.  Many movies try to dismiss those who hate.  This film tries to understand where they are coming from and shows us how close we all are to crossing the line.  I highly recommend this film to everyone.</p></body></html>

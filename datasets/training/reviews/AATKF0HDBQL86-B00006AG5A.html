<meta name="summary" content="The Rock: Master Showman"></head><body><p>I was a wrestling fan long before The Scorpion King ever came out, and I have to say that Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock, is a master showman in whatever medium he chooses.  As Mathayus, the Arkadian assassin, he is a force to be reckoned with, hacking his way through his enemies with nary a backward glance.  His one weak spot is the Sorceress (Kelly Hu) he was meant to kill, but when he realizes the depth of his feelings for her, he will do anything to protect her.  Dwayne Johnson manages to combine both these elements into one film without making the story into a total joke in the process.<p>I would like to point out that this movie is not for everyone.  If you're one of those out there who are looking for a film that is gravid with meaning and emotion, then The Scorpion King isn't for you.  If you just want to see an action-packed film that happens to have some fine acting in it as well, then by all means, grab your wallet out and buy it.  It's your choice.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Queenly Stretch"></head><body><p>I hadn't read much about the film before renting it so I wasn't sure what to expect.<br /><br />The film covers a few short months in the lives of the Royal family beginning at the election of Tony Blair and ending two months after Diana's death.<br /><br />The plot is slow moving. Don't expect action. Quiet moments of discussion between the Queen and different family or staff members fills the majority of the film.<br /><br />Interspersed between newscast reports of the details of Diana's death are scenes of reaction and struggle as the Queen stretches to do the right thing -- even though it may not feel proper.<br /><br />This is a very well acted study of characters placed in tough and unfamiliar situations.</p></body></html>

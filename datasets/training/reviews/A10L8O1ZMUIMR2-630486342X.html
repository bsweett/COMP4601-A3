It is the most ruthless, gruesome, blood-fest I have ever seen. This one tops "Saving Private Ryan." Except for that movie, the violence is shown as sad and honorable, but the violence in this film is completely more vile. I am not saying I did not like this movie, because I love it, just that it is extremely grotesque. I bought this after loving "Pulp Fiction" to pieces, and had to see what all the hype was about. I wouldn't go as far as saying that this is better than "Pulp Fiction," but it sure does come in close. Trust me, this is so much more violent than any other movie you've seen. It's not just the violence, it's the way it's presented.<p>Quentin Tarantino sticks with the same recipe for all his films; profane, disturbing, darkly comical, gruesome, and ruthless. But I would have to say that this film tops them all. In every one of his films, he puts in a few highly memorable yet disturbing scenes that rule the cinema. For example, the syringe full of adrenaline in "Pulp Fiction." However, in "Reservoir Dogs," there is one huge scene that's glued in my mind. It is a scene more evil than anything shown in "The Exorcist" and twice as gory. If you saw this movie, you know what scene I'm talking about. It is extremely intense and very sad. You've been warned.<p>This is basically the good version of a "chick flick." It has emotional scenes that jerk your feelings around. The end is very powerful, the perfect thing to end a movie with. However, don't see this expecting to see a "chick flick" because IT'S NOT! I wouldn't be eating while watching this, it's a film you need to pay much attention to and has you glued in...although I wouldn't reccomend eating for other reasons.<p>The 10th Anniversary DVD is quite nice...I got the Mr. Brown version because it was signed by Quentin Tarantino and because he is the creator, even though he has a small role in the film. I don't see why the second disc is fullscreen which is completely unnecessary, but oh well. I'm not complaining. It is a very great purchase and will keep you coming back to watch over and over...if you can stand the content. An overall wonderful film that I will always be proud to have in my DVD library.</p></body></html>

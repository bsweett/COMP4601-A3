<meta name="summary" content="Hereafter - by Haunted Flower"></head><body><p>"Hereafter" was directed by Clint Eastwood and stars Matt Damon, C&eacute;cile De France, and Frankie and George McLaren. George Lonegan (Damon) is a psychic who views himself cursed with this "gift" of visions and the ability to talk to those in the afterlife. Marie LeLay was a respected television journalist until a brush with death in the form of a giant tidal wave inspires her to write a novel called "Hereafter". Frankie and George McLaren play the twins Marcus and Jason. Marcus is on a search for answers after his brother dies suddenly and he didn't get to say goodbye. Eventually all three cross paths in the most random of ways that will make you raise an eyebrow.<br /><br />This film tried to bill itself several different ways as if it was similar to "The Sixth Sense" (it isn't) or perhaps is a big budget thriller since it has that giant wave and another accident scene later (two scenes does not an action movie make). This is a quiet, slow-paced drama watching these people attempt to continue their lives though one feels cursed and his relationships always fall apart, one is being abandoned by those close to her that feel she is losing it, and the brother that feels like half of a whole. The whole film is just ok for me. I felt it easier to relate to the woman and the twin than the psychic's dilemma. Jay Mohr is a great casting choice for George Lonegan's brother who wants him to start making money off his talent again (with the brother as manager, of course). While Cecile and Marcus are both on a determined path looking for answers, I felt like George was wandering aimlessly just hoping to dissolve into the background, giving up on happiness all because as soon as someone finds out he is psychic, they demand a reading and don't like what they hear. The tidal wave was VERY impressive shaking my entire living room with the sound, but seeing it this week for the first time seemed far too much like the current events in Japan (which I hear this film title was pulled from the Japan market by request).<br /><br />Even if the afterlife, heaven/hell/whatever is a fascinating subject for you, the film really doesn't go very deeply into it. All the characters have very mild experiences and most of their journey takes place trying to get others in the tangible world to understand them. *Shrug* Oh and the ending made me roll my eyes so that didn't help either.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />The movie can be played with focus points or you can watch them separately. You can learn all the different aspects that went into filming the tsunami tidal wave. Exploring the possibility of life after death just asks actors, filmmakers, and producers what their opinions are on the subject. Clint Eastwood talks about the casting of the film, who auditioned and who was given their roles on the spot, and the casting of locations, and as always the actors talk about Eastwood as a director. They interview some mediums who talk about "head-tapping" to profile violent criminals and make predictions. They also explore the bonds between twins from experience and also the filmmaker's knowledge of the "white light" experience many have when near death.<br /><br />"The Eastwood Factor" is a feature-length profile of the Actor/Director's career, in his own words, covering his over 35 years with Warner Bros. Obviously this documentary was originally made for "Invictus" because of the introduction and Morgan Freeman narrating. There are clips from tons of his movies exploring his favorite characters and aspects of his career. It's a great introduction to Eastwood for newcomers and a good refresher course for avid fans complete with a tour of his own costume library.</p></body></html>

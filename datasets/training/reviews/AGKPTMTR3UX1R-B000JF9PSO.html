<meta name="summary" content="United 93"></head><body><p>This is a respectful, well-acted, honest, and as scrupulously accurate a cinematic account of the tragic flight of United 93 as we are probably ever going to see. For the few of you who don't know (and for you "Truthers" who disrespectfully call people "sheeple"), United 93 was the fourth plane hijacked on September 11, 2001. The plane was turned toward Washington DC by the terrorists, but it never got there, instead crashing into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. As far as we can tell, the passengers attempted to seize the plane from the hijackers, who drove it a full speed straight into the earth. No one survived.<br /><br />Some of what we see onscreen is necessarily supposition, based on ambient sounds in cellphone and airphone calls made by the passengers. We'll never know if the passengers succeeded in taking the plane even for a moment, but I like to think so.<br /><br />People have said that this film is exploitative. They are, of course, welcome to their opinions, but there is nothing exploitative about UNITED 93, any more than there was anything exploitative about APOLLO 13. Film has become a medium for reporting history, hopefully responsibly.<br /><br />"9/11 Truthers," in love with conspiracy theories, advance the idea that the government planned the entire incident, but their "facts" are made of inference upon inference, skewed to acheive a particular result. Bushworld did not need 9/11 to advance it's Preemptive War Doctrine; any of a score of minor incidents would have sufficed. Hitler started World War II over a border incident at Gleiwitz, a phony incident in which German soldiers battled other German soldiers masquerading as Polish soldiers. A few phony mannequin soldiers were even "killed."<br /><br />But there was certainly nothing phony about the deaths on 9/11.<br /><br />The media and the establishment have made "heroes" out of the Flight 93 passengers, but this both embellishes and obscures the truth. Americans tend to like their "heroes" larger than life, infallible, brave beyond reckoning, and unblemished, the types of mythic figures of which we make statues.<br /><br />Yet we forget that the true heroes are everyday people, like fathers and mothers who go to work each day, return home each night, and dedicate their lives to the kids and to little things like painting the garage, and people who keep on with an exhausting and impossible task to the end no matter the result.<br /><br />The Flight 93 passengers are these kinds of heroes, heroes without quotation marks.<br /><br />After hearing the news that the World Trade Center and The Pentagon had been attacked, realizing that they themselves were doomed if they did nothing, and faced with the reality that they most likely would die anyway, they fought back against the zeal-infected hijackers with airline cutlery, hot water, and sheer determination. Flight 93 became a manned cruise missile, a kamikaze mission, and a battleground on which a group of ordinary, terrified people transcended fear in order to take back what had been taken from them, their lives. That they died in no way diminishes what they accomplished.<br /><br />This film is a fitting memorial to them.</p></body></html>

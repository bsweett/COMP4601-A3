I'm not saying anyone else's review is wrong.  But being an American, seeing the movie in America with English subtitles, I feel I have every right to review it with from an American perspective.  So I'll give my thoughts on what would have otherwise been a too-slowly paced movie.<br /><br />First, what surprised me the most was the movie's positive view of the United States.  The last thing I ever expected out of an HBO-affiliated film was soft-core pro-America propaganda, but there it was.  Now, as a policy matter I'm not sure I'm in favor of a teenage drug mule ditching her family to come to America and have her illegitimate child at taxpayer expense, but hey, I'm honored she'd even consider it.<br /><br />Second, I thought the movie did a wonderful job showing the bottom of the drug supply food chain.  We have seen some great movies of life at the top of organized crime (e.g., The Godfather) and also at the working class level (e.g., "Good Fellas").  This one definitely has a bird's eye view of the working poor in the drug trade.  It answers the questions Who, Why and How of drug mules with a verisimilitude that astounds (the When, Where and What we already knew).  That makes the movie worth watching.<br /><br />Also, great acting. Ms. Moreno is outstanding and utterly believable.</p></body></html>

The animals are important, but wisely kept as second focus in favor of Tim Treadwell.  Tim was a filmmaker himself who tried to bond with grizzly bears until his tragic death when he and his girlfriend, Amy, were mauled and eaten by a grizzly in Kodiak.  Now this fact is established in the first few minutes and elaborated throughout the film.  Mostly, I went in believing that the film would consist of Treadwell's films mixed with commentary.  However, slightly over half of the material investigates their deaths and mostly his life.  The angles make this documentary so special and complete.  To establish an understanding of Tim the person, there are testimonies by Tim's former lovers, family, and friends.  As an investigation of his death, Herzog interviews an ecologist couple, the Park Service, and the coroner.  In addition friend and Bush pilot, Willy Fulton, has a great deal to tell us about both his death and life.  Everyone has something to bring to the table--even the hunters.  We first have to learn about the man; then we have to see what went wrong when he dared the ghost too long and too often.<br /><br />One of the best perspectives offered is from Native Alutiiq museum curator, Sven Haakanson, PhD. who says it best:  "If you look at it from my culture, Timothy Treadwell crossed a boundary that we have lived with for 7,000 years.  It's an unspoken boundary, an unknown boundary.  But when we know we've crossed it, we pay the price."  Which is certainly a refreshing departure from the usual sentiments:  "He died doing what he loved best." Or having to listen to some conservatives invoking the death penalty like it was poetic justice.  (Imagine taking sides with an animal instead of a human!)  Herzog himself seems to invoke nature as cold-blooded.  Tim also articulates the harm's way he's put himself in several times, but he balances that--or unbalances that!--with a child-like exuberance for creatures he's seemed to project himself upon.  It's not that much different with pets, except Tim has a protective nature for the grizzlies like it was an extension of himself.  The other revelations are meant to unearth yourselves.<br /><br />'Grizzly Man' is really about a man's passion, his vulnerability, his enthusiasm, but also his disintegration.  Like tracing bear paw prints, the movie does a marvelous and responsible job at reinacting a tragedy.  There was a second big surprise for me:  Herzog wisely leaves out the recordings that Treadwell unintentionally provided at the time of their deaths.  Having seen TV news magazines that have left nothing to the imagination, it's taken me this long to see this incredible documentary.  Herzog uses prudence.  And prudence is sorely needed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""It's Impossible to Separate the Fact from the Fiction""></head><body><p>Keep that in mind as you watch "Big Fish," for the fact and the fiction come together in a cohesive whole to paint a picture of the eccentric Edward Bloom in this touching, fanciful story of a father who tells tall tales and the son trying to make sense of them.  Considering the films' sweetness, warm nature and uplifting story, is surprised to learn that Tim Burton was on hand to direct.  Burton, now in his fourties, is a perpetual Hollywood outsider, often telling stories of sympathetic oddballs and socital outcasts, which come through in films like his "Edward Scissorhands" and even his take on Batman, which paint Bruce Wayne has a lonely, bachelor billionaire saving society while not taking full part in it either.  But in "Big Fish," Burton shows his emotional range, reportedly taking the project after the death of his own father.<p>The film opens as Edward Bloom (a terrific Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor) and his son Will (Billy Crudup) are estranged due to Edwards' unbelievable stories about his life, which Will has grown tired of.  But, with Edward on his death bed, Will goes to his side, to try and learn the truth to why his father tells these tales.  Through various stroytellers and listeners, we learn Edwards' remarkable life story:  meeting witches, giants, werewolves, swampy utopias, his romantic hook up with his wife (Allison Loman and Jessica Lange), his fighting in Korea and saving that same Utopia he had visited earlier in his life.  This web of stories are expertly woven by, not only Burton, but also screenwriter John August ("Go") who fill the story, not only with idyllic images of Americana and plenty of good-natured humor, but with an emotional core that one cannot help but connect with.<p>And that core is done justice by an excellent acting ensemble, led by the lovable Albert Finney as the aging Bloom an Ewan McGregor and the younger.  Their performances perfectly match, weaving a character as fanciful as his stories but also as real as his disease.  Look for Finney to take home an Oscar for his work.  Billy Crudup is wonderful as well as the doubting Will, who softens throughout the film, leading to a tear-jerker scene in which, by telling his own story, Will shows he understands his father.  Juicy turns are on hand all around, as Steve Buscemi plays a poet turned bank robber, Danny De-Vito as a werewolf carnival manager and Helena Bonham Carter as a scret admirer of Edward and his tales.  One of the surprise best of the year, "Big Fish" will leave you believing in those tall tales again, and Tim Burton's filmmaking abilities.</p></body></html>

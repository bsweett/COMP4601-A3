If you love horror movies, and more specifically, if you love zombie movies you owe a lot of your enjoyment to this film. Shocking for it's time and still holds up. What is most important about this film is that it gave director and creator George Romero a path to make the movies he wanted to make. For that alone it deserves immense respect as one of the all time classic films. 5 stars because I can't give 5 million stars.</p></body></html>

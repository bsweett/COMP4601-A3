<meta name="summary" content="Pure Kubrick"></head><body><p>Watching the cinematography and the pacing, I am taking back to other Kubrick films like "2001" and "A Clockwork Orange."  The overall feel of uneasiness reminded me a lot of the latter.<p>This is a very sexual movie, and the conflict lies in sexual impropriety.  Oddly enough, the two protagonists, Cruise and Kidman, never have sex with anyone besides each other (and they are married).  The conflict is more in the mental act of being unfaithful, real or imagined.  The whole idea of the "unreality" of the whole situation is what Kubrick shows so well here.  It is unsettling.<p>Since there are drug and dream elements of the film, conversations seem to take a longer time than necessary.  It helps the ambience of the film, but I found myself waiting for Nicole to finish her sentence.  No one seems to believe what he or she hears (or sees) as evidenced by a constant questioning.  <p>I would recommend this to Stanley Kubrick fans and any one wanting to watch a master director at work.  I would not recommend this for casual viewing.</p></body></html>

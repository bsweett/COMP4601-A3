<meta name="summary" content="8 reasons why you should watch `8 Mile'..."></head><body><p>8)  Mekhi Phifer.  I know that this may not mean much to a lot of you, but Phifer is a ridiculously talented actor who just hasn't received the exposure he deserves.  It's hard for African American actors in this industry, because they are all too often either cast in predominantly Black films that get no exposure or they get cast as the stereotypical sidekick.  Phifer has bared his acting chops in every role he's been handed, and this is no exception.  He really sinks his teeth into the role of David `Future' Porter, giving him a life all his own, with real viewpoints, aspirations and emotions.  He is far more than just a `sidekick', he's a life force propelling his friend to greatness.<br /><br />7)  The rap.  Yeah, this is a rap movie so-to-speak, and the gritty rap battles are major highlights, especially the final ones where Rabbit grows a pair and lets it loose.  If you are a fan of Eminem as an artist, or any of his crew, then the freestyle rap-offs will have you smiling from ear-to-ear.<br /><br />6)  The gritty direction.  Curtis Hanson is a phenomenal director, and that statement is made based on his flawless transference of `L.A. Confidential' to the big screen back in 1997.  He brings an even grittier feel to this film, allowing the very essence of this man's life to burry itself in every frame.  This film feels SO LIVED IN, genuinely evoking from start to finish, and while other factors obviously are in play here, it is Hanson's direction that establishes the film's core.  He understands the tale he is telling, and he pulls so much out of this cast (I mean, he gets an Award worthy performance out of Eminem, but I'll get to that in a minute).<br /><br />5)  The sharp script.  This is a very smart film, because it could have easily fallen victim to the clich&eacute;s of the genre, but it doesn't; at all.  It really `goes there', creating real people with real issues and real situations that bleed so much honesty and truth.  Some have gripped about the relationship between Alex and Rabbit, but I find it truthful and earnest.  Even her betrayal reads with such gritty authenticity you can completely connect to it.  The dialog is realistic (yes, all those 4-letters words feel appropriate) and the progressive plot ends on a realistic note as well (that sense of accomplishment is never overshadowed by a Hollywoodized improbability).<br /><br />4)  R.I.P. Britney Murphy.  Yes, this is one of her finest roles.  I ache when I think that such a criminally underrated star (and such a breath of fresh beauty) is gone from us.  Her slick sensuality coupled with the understanding of her character (glorified groupie intent of getting a piece herself) helps create a character we love to hate, and cannot forget.<br /><br />3)  It's semi-autobiographical.  I think my friend said it best, when this film was released.  He said "I'd love to see how Eminem got his start" and while this is not a strict biography (it's loosly based on Marshall's life, pre-stardom) it really helps you appreciate who Eminem really is.  Taking bits from his shattered home-life (his relationship with his alcoholic mother takes a more tenderly frustrated turn in the film, as apposed to the volatile way he explains it now) as well as his talent, `8 Mile' gives the audience a glimpse into the trials and triumphs of one of hip-hops most notoriously controversial (and critically applauded) players.<br /><br />2)  Eminem is REALLY good here.  I'm serious.  I never would have thought that he would hold his own, and I actually thought that casting him in the lead was a bit of a mistake, but he really blew me away with this one.  I guess it is true, that once you lived it you understand it, because nothing about his performance seems forced or inappropriate.  He's so natural here, completely bringing you along as he travels the road to personal betterment.  I don't know if I can applaud the performance enough, and it's not just because he's a rapper and acting is out of his element so `for a rapper' he does a great job.  This is just a great performance, period.<br /><br />1)  Because I know what I'm talking about!  Really, I do!</p></body></html>

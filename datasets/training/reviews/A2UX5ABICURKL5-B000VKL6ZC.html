<meta name="summary" content="Under another name it would have been a great horror flick!!"></head><body><p>When you make a remake of a movie it should come close to the original story.<br />For me it took to much of a left turn, it had no feel like the original Halloween.<br />It seems that people that make movies think movie goers like to listen to bad language, I thought that's what made the original Halloween unique is that there wasn't much bad language in it.<br />It's cool that ROB gave us a insight on how Michael became a serial killer, and the guy playing Michael is a giant.<br />This movie reminds me more of "Friday the 13th" or "The Texas chainsaw massacre".<br />Just to let you know now this movie has quite a few sex sense in it.<br />Don't!! start watching this movie thinking it's like the original Halloween.<br />I rate this DVD a 3 of 5 stars!!</p></body></html>

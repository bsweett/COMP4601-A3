<meta name="summary" content="Why isn't there a Quest for a Sequel?"></head><body><p>Most times I think movies stand on their own and should not be sequelized. This movie however is a great parody of SciFi and Star Trek in particular. The cast is superb and will have you laughing throughout the movie. Top notch special effects and music. Directing can't be beat either. This winning combination made it a hit with most audiences, not just SciFi fans. So I ask again why no sequel? For fans of drama only, you may want to see something else since this is excellent comedy done by those that have done marvelous drama as well. THIS IS COMEDY, NOT DRAMA! I would be especially surprised if anyone that has gone to a SciFi convention didn't find this hysterically fun.<br /><br />If by chance you have not seen this movie the story goes that a group of actors/actress that starred in a series like Star Trek are appearing at a SciFi convention. At the convention a group of aliens approaches the Commander played by Tim Allen. He thinks they are just convention goers in costume that want him for a gig at another place. When he finds out they have have modelled their spaceship and lifes after the TV show, life gets weird and very funny. The cast must have had a blast doing these roles. Tim Allen and Tony Shalhoub we expect in comedy, but Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman have usually played more dramatic roles. They all do wonderful jobs of making you laugh.<br /><br />The DVD quality is excellent and includes a documentary and deleted scenes you will love. Picture and sound were sharp and no problems with playing. Nice menu interface that matches the theme of the movie. I highly recommend adding it to your collection.</p></body></html>

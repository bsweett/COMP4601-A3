Because Inglorious Basterds is way more than a slaughterfest. Don't get me wrong...oh, it has it's moments of slaughter, but what makes Inglorious Basterds such a great movie is the sophisticated stories and plotlines leading up to the more violent parts of the movie.<br /><br />First, a word on Writer/Director Quentin Tarantino's casting: superb! Look, I've heard the criticism that Brad Pitt is successful only because he's a pretty boy, and I have to ask: what the heck is that all about? Pitt is excellent in Inglorious Basterds. The guy can act. The way Pitt scrunches up his face in an annoyed look throughout the entire film and combines it with a no mercy attitude is believable and effective...it works. Really works. And the rest of the cast?...Amazing. Tarantino uses French actors to play the French and German Actors to play the Germans, and this just added an element of reality to a story that (unfortunately) was fictitious.<br /><br />And the guy who plays the head of Hitler's security deserves Hollywood's highest kudos at all of their self indulgent award shows. German Actor Christoph Waltz plays the evil, intelligent and diabolical Colonel Hans Landa, and when he walks into a scene you shudder. You will not soon forget Waltz's performance.<br /><br />Tarantino masterfully gets A+ performances out of his cast to tell the story of two plots to assassinate Nazi Germany's top leadership. The movie is devoted more to the development of these plotlines than it is to showing the development of the infamous reputation for murdering Nazi soldiers that Pitt and his band of brothers have. So as I said earlier, walk into Inglorious Basterds with your expectation set for a well-directed, intricate, often deep, storyline with some pretty violent moments and your expectations will be met.<br /><br />The climactic ending was a bit unbelievable. But overall, Inglorious Basterds is a great movie. Don't miss it.</p></body></html>

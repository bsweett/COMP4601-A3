<meta name="summary" content="Watch out for ugly French rednecks..."></head><body><p>High Tension is for horror aficionados only, great cinema it is not.  At a horror event, I received some very cool promo material for this movie and couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD.  After a sweet titillation near the beginning (head jokes will roll), the movie slows down.  Keep watching...it gets better.<br /><br />Marie (Cecile de France) is invited to visit the French countryside by classmate and pal Alexia (Maiwenn le Besco) and stay with her family at their old French manor house.  Needless to say, Marie is bored before they even arrive.<br /><br />Enter the ugly French redneck, who brutally and without reason butchers Alex's family before taking Alex away in his filthy, rattling delivery truck.  Marie escapes his notice and follows.  Marie must get Alex away from said ugly French redneck before something horrible happens to her, too.<br /><br />I say no more.  A typical horror plot turns into a twisting tale of obsessive love and inner conflict.  When this happened, the movie quickly jumped from three stars to four.<br /><br />The FX gets better as the movie progresses, so the best gore is near the end, when we are introduced to a decrepit circular saw (a wonderfully vile toy in the hands of the insane).<br /><br />I had no idea at first this was a French movie, and the English dubbed version is pretty bad.  I recommend watching it in the original French and using English subtitles, you will pick up more of the emotion and won't miss out by using subtitles.  Even in the English dubbed, some of the movie is still in French.<br /><br />All in all, a nice, bloody tidbit to add to your cheesy horror collection, suitably gory with a "gutsy", twisted ending.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

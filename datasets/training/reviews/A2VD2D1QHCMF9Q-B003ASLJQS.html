<meta name="summary" content="Riveting Movie!"></head><body><p>A riveting movie, with some rough spots, but overall, a thoughtful, deliberate and successful story.  It's a slice of working class life in a working class town, where there is no escaping the past.  Only in a town like this, as opposed to a big city, would the three friends at the center of the story, live in the same place and reminisce about the same things they did a generation ago.  There are so many conflicting themes, including a wife who does not give her husband the support a wife should provide, and prior friendships seem to dissolve in spite of themselves.  And at the end, the morality of actions beg the question of  . . is a painful life worth living.  Do things always turn out with some kind of poetic justice, and how is good and bad defined with respect to each other.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Eh, What's with all the green?? Could have been better."></head><body><p>This was the worst even-numbered Trek film made. It should have been MUCH better, since it is supposed to be the last STTNG film. <p>Better space battles, better story, better ending. <p>The &quot;climactic space battle&quot; was lackluster: Is that the best a Soveriegn class battlecruiser can do?? &quot;We're out of torpedoes&quot;?? Hoo-boy! More ships would have been nice too. I won't spoil the ending, lets just say it made me somewhat upset. I did like the new federation shuttle though.</p></body></html>

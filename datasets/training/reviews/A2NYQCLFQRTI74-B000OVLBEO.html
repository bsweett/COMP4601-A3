<meta name="summary" content="the worst comic film ever"></head><body><p>Upon discovering his father has terminal cancer, motorcyclist Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) signs a pact with Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda), giving his soul for his father's health. The devil deceives him and his father dies in a motorcycle accident. Johnny leaves everything, even Roxanne, his girlfriend (played in later years by Eva Mendes).<br />Years later, now a famous motorcyclist, Johnny gets a proposal from Mephistopheles: he will release the contract if Johnny becomes the 'Ghost Rider' and defeat his son, Blackheart (Wes Bentley), who wants 1,000 evil souls and hell on earth.<br /><br />I've never heard of the Ghost Rider comic, so when I started the movie, I didn't realize what I was getting into. Now as a comic book character, Ghost Rider is all right although he is not that interesting.<br /><br />The plot is one that many movies have already shown. Nothing original there.<br /><br />The actors!! Oh my. This honestly looked like a made-for-tv movie. Nicolas Cage was just too lousy. The way he was delivering his lines! It looked like he was suffering half the time.<br /><br />The special effects are not that stunning. They're okay by my book. Nothing out of the ordinary.<br /><br />My family and I watched this together last night, and we all particularly agreed that this was a stupid, badly done movie. I name it the worst comic film ever. (And I've seen most of the recent productions.)<br /><br />If you must watch it, do so at your own risk.</p></body></html>

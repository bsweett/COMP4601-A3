<meta name="summary" content="Slumdog Millionaire"></head><body><p>I really liked this movie.  It was interesting and kept me captivated on what was going to happen next.<br /><br />Jamal (Dev Patel among other actors), a young boy from the slums of India and his brother Salim (Madhur Mittal among other actors) sadly lose their mother early to a violent death.  While most of the movie starts from when they are very young, the different scenes show them growing up and fending for themselves on the streets.<br /><br />More of the plot however, centers around Jamal being on the show of India's version of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire."  One question away from winning the grand prize, he is forced into police custody and tortured to see how he is winning (they believe he is cheating).  Instead, he tells them how he knows the answers and in doing so, gives them the story of his life.  Prominently featured in these stories is Latika (Freida Pinto among others) who is a young girl who joins them in their travails after their mother's death.<br /><br />Each question a new part of Jamal's life is uncovered.  Most of it is very brutal; to be sure there are not many happy parts in this movie.  Now as a contestant on this show, his only thought is to get Latika back, which could prove very dangerous.<br /><br />For warning, this movie is very graphic.  It features beatings, murders, and other acts of violence.  Definitely not a good movie for the younger crowd.  It is realistically done though so I could imagine things like this happening.<br /><br />The characters were well played I thought.  Dev Patel especially as Jamal did great at portraying his worry over Latika and his quest to find her.  For some reason the actor who played his brother reminded me of Michael Jackson in his younger years, but it was only mildly distracting from the movie.  All the other characters seemed authentic enough as well.  The only character that wasn't truly amazing to me was the older Latika, while she was quite beautiful, there wasn't a lot of depth that went into her character like there was for the rest of them.<br /><br />The music in this movie was fantastic.  It was a mix of Indian/English so while a non-Indian dialect speaker might not be able to understand some of the lyrics, there were some that could be understood.  They had great rhythm and fit the flow of the story nicely.<br /><br />Overall a great movie.  There was a lot of action but enough story to keep you engaged in the characters.  I truly cared about how the ending would turn out and was pleasantly surprised and equally as shocked at the results.  I can see why it won so many awards.</p></body></html>

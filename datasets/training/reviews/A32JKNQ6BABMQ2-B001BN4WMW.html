<meta name="summary" content="the best true movie ever"></head><body><p>this is my 4th favorite movie ever!its about a scottish revolutionary named william wallace.he and friends were peasents in ancient times.england tried to takeover scotland and he banded together all the nobodies to take the battle to england.they were commonly outnumbered at least 10 to 1,using only leather armor and wooden spears,and utilized brainy tactics to overthrow a far more powerful english army.mel gibson is in it in his greatest role ever.its a bit bloody for kids.there are many beautiful quotes from the movie such as"you dont choose your dreams,your dreams choose you"and "every man dies but not every man really lives".it is the best movie set in mid-evil times ever!its likeable by most anyone.theres blood and guts,romance,intensity,emotion,strategy,action and much much more!it is true.there are many very beautiful women here.mel gibson gave the performance of a lifetime as william wallace.his friend steven,an crazy irish guy who hears god like joan of arc,puts on a great show too.no words can describe how great this movie is!!!!!!!!!the final scene with william wallace is very grueling.theres many bloody battles.theres cauterization of wounds,dead people dying in thier families arms,its very emotional.the important mesage is that this guy belived in something hed rather die than live without his freedom.it is a very very long movie but never gets old for even a second.a classic!</p></body></html>

It keeps its pace, and you never loose interest. It shows you his life as a child as he was going blind - and his life as adult, with his band and his family.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is outstanding as he portrays Ray. He has the character of this famous musician down to perfection.<br /><br />And the music is wonderful too. The soundtrack is fabulous, taking you back to the creation of some of the best music of the time period.</p></body></html>

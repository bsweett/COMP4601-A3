And, though he's uncredited (at least, until the end credits, that I noticed), I love Christopher Walken.  So why was I so underwhelmed with this movie? <p><p>Point 1: What made the  Blair Witch Project so effective? 1. Lack of musical score. 2. Lack of  musical score. 3. Lack of musical score. Is it me, or is Danny Elfman  starting to repeat himself these days? I could have sworn I'd heard a  number of parts of this soundtrack in other Burton flicks. (Point for the  devil's advocate-- this may be par for the course in Hollywood; if the  previews are anything like the film, you can expect The Green Mile to have  the same soundtrack as The Shawshank Redemption.) Pieces of it are just  plain overblown. Not the whole thing; there are times, as always, when  Elfman's music is creepily effective, but more often than not it gets loud,  melodramatic, and annoying. <p><p>Point 2: I have a thing against any movie  that requires someone to stand up, pace, and explain the whole thing at the  end. The idea of a good mystery is that enough clues are given you so that  you can figure it out for yourself, if you have the quickness of wit and  aren't being distracted by a theater full of crying children (which I was).  And make no mistake, the clues are there to be found. However, no context  is given them. At the end, when the clues are pieced together so you figure  all this out, the clues are flashed back on the screen. But in every case  save one, you see more in the flashbacks than you did in the actual scenes.  Not good, not good at all. <p><p>Point 3, and I'll admit this is a personal  preference: Christina Ricci doesn't sound right with an affected  new-world-British accent. Period. <p><p>Point 4, and it's even more  naggy-stupid-personal: they found the single ugliest child in the human  race to play Ichabod as a kid. Holy cow. He's out of one of those  nineteenth-century portraits where the kids' heads are five times too large  for their bodies and no one ever smiles. Now we know why-- they all had  teeth that look like his. Ugh. <p><p>Sure, there's good stuff to be said.  Walken, Walken, Walken, Johnny Depp, a fine cameo by Christopher Lee (with  two minutes of screen time, one wonders why he's in the opening credits),  Van Dien, and for that matter most of the villagers; the gore factor is  done with an eye to humor, and many of the film's laughs come at its  bloodiest moments; Burton's sense of the fantastic and silly is as  perfectly-honed as always. I just wish it had come off as a better mystery.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Deeper shades underneath the Saturday afternoon pulp"></head><body><p>"Road To Perdition" is a fine Saturday matinee for adults; it's appealing as a gangster potboiler, and, if choose to seek a little longer, it's appealing intellectually. I think of the Coen Brothers' "Miller's Crossing," a stylish movie only enjoyable on the first level and not the second, whereas this vehicle has deeper and darker shades upon which to ruminate.<p> Tom Hanks is a hitman and Paul Newman is his local mob boss in 1920s Illinois, a state run by the Capone crime family in Chicago. Hanks has two sons and a wife, and Newman has his son and is a widow. Newman's son, Connor (Daniel Craig) was born with a brutal streak mixed with a grown boy's petulance. You put a gun in the hands of a man like that, and innocent heads will roll. <p> They do, sure enough, and all would be well if one of Hanks' son weren't there to see it. Connor wants the kid dead, Hanks dead, the whole family dead. He settles for two of the four. Hanks and son are forced on the road to survive, bond and plot a means of vengeance. Newman hires a traveling hitman, played by Jude Law, to track down Hanks and son.<br /><br />Now, onto the deeper, darker shades:<br /><br /> 1. The movie works, I think, if you understand Hanks' character is essentially na?ve; that is, he fails to understand the ingrained violence in his business -- yes, even though he is a hitman -- and what it might mean for even a man who does his job well. It's hardly fair that, when Hanks asks for Capone's help, assistant Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci) has to turn him down despite not wanting to. That's the illogic of the mafia; it consistently does things adverse to its well-being to stay in lockstep with its quirky "code." In this significant way it differs, say, a government. <p> Hanks does not play a smart man. He is a simpleton, actually; once he understands the low odds, his recourse is just to kill them all. It's his only recourse, but a smarter man might have tried other things. It's important to note that pleading to Capone is not another thing, but a false illusion Hanks' character initially has.<p> 2. You have to accept the Greek tragedy structure. Law's character, essentially, is death, and he waits at the end of the movie as if he was always going to be there. He haunts the film. His own death is appropriate, because death will manifest itself in someone different. Law's character was merely a vessel. This idea is considered nicely in our introduction to the character; Law walks toward us and stays oddly in proportion with his surroundings; an optical trick by Conrad Hall, it's as if Law is entering from the netherworld.<p> The tragedy structure also explains the things that are inexplicable. Why Newman would protect his worthless son, for example. Normally, mafia sons are expendable, especially in movies; consider "The Godfather, Part II."<br /><br /> 3. This is the best looking film of the year. Couldn't you just spend a week haunting all the sets in this film? I'd like to credit director Sam Mendes, and I will, but only because he allowed the cinematographer, the departed Conrad L. Hall, the freedom to be a virtuoso. Hall simply understands the camera; the overhead angle that opens the Tommy gun scene is obviously his idea, as is Law entrance.<p> When awards time rolled around, "Road To Perdition" was overlooked, maybe because the story was a bit much. But its place on the list of many movie fans will linger, because there's much to ponder. In retrospect, this should have been a winter release, where it could reaped, oh, eight to ten nominations. What we have will have to do, but this was an outstanding film.</p></body></html>

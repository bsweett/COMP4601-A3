Oops. I did originally see it in the theaters, and I liked it a great deal more than I thought I was going to, given the voice talent in it, but I never quite liked it as much as everyone else seemed to. And thus I've been trying to write this review on and off since I was wishing for the kinds of temperatures we have now. (Stupid me, I never learn. I'm pining for ninety-degree days again.)<br /><br />Osborne (until now best known for his Weird Al Yankovic video "Jurassic Park") and Stevenson (responsible for the fine, and all too short-lived, TV show Father of the Pride) give us the tale of Po (Jack Black), a somewhat lazy panda whose sole desire is to be a martial artist like his heroes, the Furious Five. Instead, however, he spends his time working at the noodle house owned by his adoptive father, Mr. Ping (James Hong). When the Furious Five's temple has an open house, the whole town turns out, and Mr. Ping sends Po to sell noodles at the gathering. Through a series of misadventures, Po finds himself tasked with becoming a Kung Fu master. Meanwhile, the evil warlord Tai Lung (Ian McShane) has escaped from captivity--can Po be the one to stop him?<br /><br />It's a fun movie, entertaining for both kids and adults alike. The main reason it surprises me that I think so is because so much of the voice talent is provided by people who either can't act (Black. Angelina Jolie and Seth Rogen voicing two of the Furious Five) or who aren't actors at all (Osborne and Stevenson both chime in, as well as production supervisor Jeremy Shipp, producer Melissa Cobb, and a handful of others who usually work behind the scenes). And yet it all came out very well. Is it, as I've seen it called, the best animated feature since the Lion King? No, I don't think so--all of the movies Pixar made during its reign as the best studio on the planet have fallen in between these--but it's certainly worth viewing if you haven't seen it yet. The humor is decidedly adult (in that it's not "playing down" to the tween/teen set with potty humor and jokes that will make parents groan), the story is inspiring, and the animation is exceptionally well-done. It may not go down in history as one of the best movies ever, but it's well worth a rental now that the DVD is out, and if you get a chance to catch it on the big screen and you never did, it's worth a look. *** ?</p></body></html>

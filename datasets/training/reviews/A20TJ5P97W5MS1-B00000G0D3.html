On the other hand Ben-Hur is arguably the most epic film ever made. This is a tour de force led by Charlton Heston in his prime. If you ever doubted that Heston was one of the greatest, watch this and you will leave the experience convinced of his skills. Also if you disagree with this film's legacy take note that it went on to win a record of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, a feat equaled only by Titanic in 1997 and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in 2003. This film was directed by William Wyler. Charlton Heston plays Prince Judah Ben-Hur. At no point in this film does it appear as if Heston's character is not 100% convinced that the events taking place are total reality. When watching Ben-Hur the viewer is transported to a different place and time. The dedication, belief, and skill Heston put into the role won him the Academy Award for best actor. Judah Ben-Hur is a wealthy merchant that accidentally catches the blame for threatening the life of a Roman general. This does not go over well and he is promptly sentenced to to serve time as galley slave. After a tough run as a slave rower he returns after saving the life of of a Roman commander. Upon his return he is granted freedom and adopted by the commander. He then goes on to be a great charioteer and the rest in cinematic golden history. Coincidentally it is also the history of the world. Ben-Hur has, and will, stand the test of time as a great chapter in the history of film.</p></body></html>

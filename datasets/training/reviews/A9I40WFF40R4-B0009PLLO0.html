<meta name="summary" content="It's Not As Bad As I Had Expected"></head><body><p>I suppose the world does not need another nobody writing on the movie ALEXANDER but here goes anyway. I had heard so many awful things about the movie that it couldn't possibly have been as bad as the reviewers said-- or in a more positive vein, it's better than I had feared.<br /><br />There are certainly problems with the film. To name some: Colin Farrell is miscast as Alexander. It is impossible to have hair that blond and eyes that dark brown unless you're an Italian woman dress designer. I should think that casting Alexander would be almost impossible, but Farrell isn't the one. Angelina Jolie at times is a commanding figure as his mother Olympias, but she speaks with a strange accent and couldn't possibly be old enough to be his mother. Did men in the time of Alexander wear eye makeup (Jared Leto as his lover Hephaistion)? Finally, the nearly 3 hour-long film moves mostly only by the commentary of Anthony Hopkins (Ptolemy) and/or captions telling the viewer the time and place of the events.<br /><br />The film does have some interesting battle scenes and some of the panoramic shots are beautiful. A lot of time and effort obviously went into the making of this "epic," but it ultimately is pretty much a lost cause.<br /><br />Oh, Mr. Stone in his accompanying remarks on the DVD makes some interesting comments contrasting the current U. S. administration's endeavors in Iraq with those of  Alexander.</p></body></html>

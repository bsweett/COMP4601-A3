The crew of the late Starship Enterprise travel to Earth from Vulcan in a stolen Klingon Bird of Prey. Back on Earth, a space probe is draining their power sources and ionizing their atmosphere. Through logic and reason, Spock finds out that the probe is trying to communicate with the extinct species of humpback whales. The Enterprise crew must time travel to 20th Century Earth to find humpbacked whales. On Earth, Admiral Kirk becomes friends with biologist Gillian Taylor(Catherine Hicks). There's a neat scene where Uhura and Chekov find the naval vessel, U.S.S. Enterprise. Star Trek IV was a big critical and commercial hit. It appealled to non-Trekkers and it has a lot of fish out of water, situation comedy. There's a scene where a rude guy with a boombox gives Kirk the middle finger! At one time, Eddie Murphy was almost cast as the biologist, but he was working on The Golden Child(1986) at the time. The music score by the late Leonard Rosenman was quite good. Star Trek IV contains references to Star Trek episodes and the older Star Trek movies. Director Leonard Nimoy claims that stories about Greenpeace gave him inspiration for the plot. The visual effects by ILM were pretty solid for 1986. Star Trek The Next Generation debuted on television a year later in 1987! The Star Trek franchise regained its mojo at the time. Star Trek IV has some early attempts at CGI as Admiral Kirk has a trippy, surreal dream. The film's happy ending is a surprise I'll leave for you guys.<br />Live long and prosper.</p></body></html>

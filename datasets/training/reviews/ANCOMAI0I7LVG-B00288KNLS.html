Between the Oscar winning `Up', Anderson's crack at animation, `Fantastic Mr. Fox' and the ghoulishly fantastic `Coraline', you have a spectacular year in this field that reigns supreme as the best of the decade.  While probably my least favorite of the three, `Coraline' is still one of the better films of that year and a definite must-see for any film enthusiast.<br /><br />In tone, this film is far different than the other two I mentioned.  In fact, all three films are so different, and I think that is another reason why this year was so great in this field.  We were offered a variety of films that excite and entertain and appeal to different sides of our cinematic taste.<br /><br />`Coraline' is dark and moody.  The production design here is simply flawless, brilliantly capturing the mood and feel of the film without going so overboard as to appear clunky and campy.  The attention to detail, whether it be with the characters or with the surroundings, is astonishing to look at.  Above all else, `Coraline' is a visual feast.<br /><br />Still, looks aren't everything.<br /><br />`Coraline' tells the story of a bored little girl.  Having just moved to an old house with her work obsessed parents, Coraline finds that she has nothing to do and no one to do it with.  Her parents are so confined to their work that they disregard Coraline as seemingly unimportant and her only companions are either crazy (the circus fare she lives beside) or annoying (a strange kid named Wybie).  When Wybie finds a doll that resembles Coraline, things start to change.  Coraline finds a secret door that eventually takes her to an alternate world where she has `other' parents, perfected variations of her own.  Coraline loves being in their company, but when they attempt to make her a permanent part of their lives things turn a tad ugly.<br /><br />The emotionally chord behind `Coraline' involves the struggle to find balance in that parent/children relationship.  On both ends we can find ourselves working against unity.  It is apparent that Coraline's parents don't consider her feelings enough (they seem almost harsh on the outset) but it is also apparent that Coraline is your average selfish teenager (or pre-teen).  Sometimes we have to take a step back and see things through the eyes of our parent or our child in order to find that unity; meeting halfway so-to-speak.  Coraline learns that the hard way, but better late than never.<br /><br />Visually stunning and emotionally profound, `Coraline' is smart and charmingly creepy.  It is not a film for everyone, and some children may find it a tad scary (some adults may even find it a tad scary), but that is the point of the film.</p></body></html>

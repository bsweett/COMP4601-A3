I really like Nicole Kidman and think she is a good actress. I also like Sean Penn in most of the work he has done and Katherine Keaner. But this movie just wasn't that good. First I found no chemistry between Penn and Kidman which would have been fine if they wouldn't have tried to throw in this stupid connection or love story with them. If it would have just been cop and the person he was protecting/suspecting it wouldn't have been bad that they didn't click together. They for some reason decide that Penn, who has only met this woman a day or two before and thinks that she may be a conspirator and possibly an assassin, for no reason at all is going to bear his soul to this complete stranger about his wife being killed just recently and how much he loved her and wanted her back and that she was coming back (which they show you by having him listen to his answering machine with a message from her saying she was coming back right before she was killed and how much he despised the guy she ran off with). No we are suppose to believe that he would tell somebody he doesn't even know this and show this total vunerable side of himself to a stranger but we are also suppose to believe that even though he is grieving the woman he loved more than anything and that she has just recently been killed that he immediately is falling for a woman that could be a killer. This is just forced, stupid and adds nothing to story but actually adds more time and makes it even more bogged down. If it would have been Kidman being a master manipulator and playing on Penns vunerablilities and using him, fine. But this was just crap that hollywood feels they have to add so they can have some love story that doesn't even need to be there.<br /><br />The pace of the movie is also slow. There are also so many African politicians, rebels, security, bodyguards and FBI, Secret Service, cops, survielance and UN Officials and interpreters that were unremarkable that I had a hard time remembering who was who. Keaner was also underused and simply a character that could have been really interesting but was basically just somebody that could say, "are you alright?" and "you need to go home" to Penn every other time she spoke.<br /><br />Its worth watching once but I really wish I would have rented it and not bought it. I wouldn't recommend it. Not one of Penn or Kidmans best efforts but that may be because of the story and direction which was a suprise cause Sydney Pollak (who makes his usual cameo) is usually very good and right on.</p></body></html>

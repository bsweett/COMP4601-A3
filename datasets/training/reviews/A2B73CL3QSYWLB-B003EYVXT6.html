<meta name="summary" content="Decent Sci-Fi Film Done In By Ludicrous Ending"></head><body><p>"Splice" for the majority of the film's running time is an intelligent riveting sci-fi thriller.  Then the preposterous ending lands like a giant thud and undoes what good will the film engendered for 95 percent of it's running time.  Not to give away the farm the scriptwriters were probably going for a "Demon Seed" ending instead it's more reminiscent of "Humanoids From the Deep".  That would be okay except the latter film was deliberately campy.  I'm not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater and give the film a one star review.  Those unsuspecting be forewarned that the film's ending negates what could have been a really great film.</p></body></html>

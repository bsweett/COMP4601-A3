<meta name="summary" content="Dogma"></head><body><p>I thought Dogma was one of Kevin Smith's best as a movie and as a comedy because of how it took a jab at religion and the church and how even if God saw this movie, he'd laugh because let's say it everyone has a sense of humor.<p>It stars an All Star cast of Linda Fiorentino, Chris Rock, Selma Hayek, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Jeanine Garafalo, Kevin Smith himself, Jason Mewes, Jason Lee, George Carlin and Alanis Morrisette. You would think that usually, when you have that many stars, the movie isn't the same because each actor/actress is trying to steal each other's thunder, but not hear because all of them have really brought together their collective skills and made Dogma a wonderful and hilarious masterpiece.<p>It starts as Affleck and Damon, 2 exiled Angels from Heaven and follows them on their killing spree before they cleanse their souls by walking through the doors of a church celebrating it's Bicentennial. By them doing this, they find a hole in God's creation and by proving God wrong, all that ever existed would cease to be. It's up to Fiorentino, Smith, Mewes, Rock and Hayek to stop them no matter what!<p>O.k. Dogma might make a few people made because it pokes fun at religion. I have to admit it, you'd probably be more offended by the vulgar swearing before that because when it all comes down to it's just a movie and there have been comedies that have made fun of very serious things. And even so, this movie never once said that religion is bad. Again, it just pokes a little fun at it.<p>I would definitely get this one. Even if you're not a Kevin Smith fan, you'll still laugh at this one. And again for any of you that are very religious, you'd probably be more offended by the swearing first. Check this one out!</p></body></html>

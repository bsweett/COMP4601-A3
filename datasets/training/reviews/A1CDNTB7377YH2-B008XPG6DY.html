<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Good but Lacks a Few Things from the Book"></head><body><p>This film pretty much follows the book by the same name except that it takes place in Chicago instead of New York.  There are some parts toward the end that were in the book but were missing from the movie (I can't say what because it would be a spoiler) so it may be good to read the book after to understand how it led up to the ending.<br /><br />Charlie Shine an ad executive takes the train to work every day.  One day he meets a leggy Lucinda on the train through a mix-up with his train ticket.  The two start-up a conversation and pretty soon are meeting each other on the train.  Lucinda tells Charlie she is in an unhappy marriage and Charlie who is married himself debates having an affair with her.  Of course the temptation is too great for him so they schedule a daytime tryst in a downtown, shady hotel.  Almost immediately after they enter the room and begins some passion, they are surprised by a mugger who robs Charlie and rapes Lucinda.  Both of them not wanting their spouses to find out, decide to say nothing to the police.<br /><br />The mugger (Mr. Vasquez), aware that they will take no action against him starts to blackmail Charlie to get whatever additional wealth that he has.  The rest of the book is difficult to talk about without a lot of spoilers but let's say that Charlie gets involved with a murder and that things are definitely not the way Charlie perceives them.<br /><br />The tension mounts throughout especially when Charlies family starts to get involved.  A pretty good thriller!</p></body></html>

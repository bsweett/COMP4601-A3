<meta name="summary" content="The Exorcism of Emily Rose  (2005)"></head><body><p>Director:  Scott Derrickson<br /><br />Cast:  Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson, Campbell Scott, Jennifer Carpenter, Colm Feore, Joshua Close, Kenneth Welsh, Duncan Fraser.<br /><br />Running Time:  119 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for thematic material, including intense/frightening sequences, and language.<br /><br />Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter, "White Chicks") is a young, naive girl, eagerly heading off to college. Upon arrival, Emily is seemingly attacked by demonic forces, which leave her on the brink of sanity. After her mysterious death from a botched exorcism, Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson) is put on trail for her demise, leaving exasperated defender Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) at a loss as to how to approach the case. As Erin probes deeper into Emily's alleged supernatural behavior, she begins to feel evil forces are following her, and puts her job and reputation at stake as she moves forward with her controversial defense that Emily was not mentally ill, but possessed by a demon.  The marketing of "Emily Rose" shows frightening images of a young girl violently possessed, a sweaty priest battling thunderous malevolent forces, and an inquisitive woman persistently trying to find out who Emily Rose was and what happened to her. To the surpise of the initial theatrical viewing, this is not the film you get with "The Exorcism of Emily Rose."  The film is more a courtroom drama that examines the theoretical differences of medicine and the Church, exploring how the belief of God and His work (and the work of the Devil) has diminished and society is outwardly focused on facts, results, and money.  "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is certainly no "Exorcist", but the film succeeds because in no shape or form is it even trying to be.<br /><br />In many ways, 'Emily Rose' is different from almost every past horror movie of the genre in the sense that it doesn't make really obvious attempts to frighten its audience. Instead, director/co-screenwriter Scott Derrickson seems content to make us think. There are several questions raised in the film regarding religious beliefs and the public's general perception of them, but these are all handled in an objective and impartial manner.  As for the scare factor, since the filmmakers aren't overly anxious in trying to scare the audience, the film actually is frightening at several points - again, unusual for a horror film. The frightening events regarding Emily Rose's exorcism are all the more frightening as they don't seem horribly staged and predictable. (although the cheesy demonic animation, as shown in the trailer, could have been done far better) It's true that composer Christopher Young seems unable to resist the horror movie clich&eacute; of having horribly over-dramatic music which builds to a climax at the most frightening moment, but for the most part the movie is able to surpass the usual horror clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />It helps of course that the cast all deliver quality performances, the obvious standout being Jennifer Carpenter as Emily. Her possession scenes are nothing short of incredible, the sheer torment she seems capable of portraying is utterly captivating. Laura Linney also shines in the lead, giving a powerful and affecting performance as the attorney of the convicted priest who performed Emily Rose's exorcism. As said priest, Tom Wilkinson also manages to impress, delivering a quietly effective and very human performance. Unfortunately, the characters of Campbell Scott (as the faithful, yet assertive prosecutor) and Colm Feore (Erin Bruner's boss at the firm) were really badly written, coming off as the typical antagonistic figures, and nothing more. Both give satisfying performances, despite their one dimensional characters, especially Feore, who has always been talented at taking terribly written characters, and giving them life and personality nonetheless.  While the film does achieve an excellent feeling of unease and suspense, it ultimately fails to live up to the promise made in being such a unique perspective on religious suspense with a strong cast. While it is indeed a unique film and possesses strong performances, it fizzles out due to a lackluster climax in which the verdict of the case is presented.  An interesting take on the horror genre worth seeing, but no classic by an stretch of the imagination.</p></body></html>

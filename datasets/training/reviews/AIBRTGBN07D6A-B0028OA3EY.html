<meta name="summary" content="Superman Returns is far from Super."></head><body><p>I love comic book movies, but this one just didn't do much for me.  At almost 3 hours long, I was expecting much more.  Brandon Routh did a great job as Superman and Clark Kent, and I was able to buy Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, but Kevin Spacey was a little too over the top as Lex Luthor.  He came off too much as a "bumbling genius" and the film never really portrayed him as much of a real threat.  In fact, the entire Lex Luthor plot could have been removed from the film entirely and it would not have made too much of a difference.<br /><br />This film is mainly about Superman's five year absence from Earth and his relationship with Lois Lane and her son.  There are a lot of scenes of Superman defeating various crimes and people cheering, all of which has been done before in the previous films.  The only new take on this we have are better special effects.  Now I know you have to show this in a Superman movie, but there was nothing that jumped out at me to give me that inner excitement and say to myself "wow, awesome!."<br /><br />While not a bad movie, "Superman Returns" just doesn't live up to the hype of 10 years of production and a huge budget.  There are too many plot holes, too much camp (Lois Lane's son kissing superman on the forehead when he's sick...), and not enough of a villain.  This movie really could have done better if Bryan Singer had demonstrated more weakness in Superman.  Where's the suspense if Superman is never really shown in danger?<br /><br />Ultimately, most general audiences will enjoy this film and I am glad I saw it, but I don't have any interest in sitting through it again or owning it on DVD.  But if you're expecting this to be one of the best films of the year and you've been waiting to see it for a decade, you'll likely be disappointed.</p></body></html>

Aging only slightly less than his onscreen character, Harrison Ford seems every bit fit and spry as the time-lapse could possibly find him.  At his side is a new adventurer, Henry "Mutt" Williams (Shia LaBeof), as likely as any successor to fill his shoes as the next matinee idol.  Noting Shia's screen presence in everything from `Transformers' to `Disturbia,' it has already happened.<br /><br />Still reinventing the tricks from the serial adventures of old, Director Spielberg and Executive Producer Lucas have teamed up to dazzle us once again.  This time the "Red Scare" is given a `<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792838289">The Manchurian Candidate</a>' balance by offering an unvarnished Soviet menace matched by an overzealous FBI investigating Professor Jones' and his university.<br /><br />Set in Nevada in 1957, Jones and his sidekick "Mack" (Ray Winstone) defend a military facility being overtaken by the Soviets in the desert.  At the compounds' storage warehouse, we find out early that "cliffhanger" is going to be as potent as any Jones has taken so far.  Leading the enemy is Col. Irina Spalko (played expertly by a steely cold Kate Blanchett, who has truly earned her own gold by her multi-faceted acting ability).  Once Indiana escapes, he finds himself on a model test city that's about to be detonated by a test atom bomb.  An asset of quietly cheeky satire, we see him going across a linoleum kitchen floor until he finds a "model" (as in mannequin) family in the living room.<br /><br />Once he regroups, he runs into leather-jacketed motorcycle Mutt who leads him to find Jones' lost colleague Harold Oxley (John Hurt) who has been kidnapped along with Mutt's mother down in the Amazon in a lost Mayan city of gold.  This time instead of a lost ark or a lost holy grail, Indiana and his new friend head to South America in search of the loved ones along with a precious artifact in the "crystal skull".  Here they sort out clues and translate an ancient language to find the lost treasure before the Soviets can.<br /><br />I can't help but make comparisons to recent DVD release '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YABYPQ">National Treasure 2 - Book of Secrets (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>'.  Both sport likable characters and able actors, and both stories are about deciphering clues that bring both entourages to a lost city of gold.  What wins out in this adventure is the suspense and entertainment:  The danger is more immediate; the timing is nearly flawless; and the jokes are far more formidable.  What separates 'NT2' from '...The Crystal Skull' is that this one is more stimulating with peril and revelations that are surprising; the other is more breezy and only lightly entertaining. Between David Koepp's screenplay, the right touches by Spielberg and Lucas, Michael Kahn's excellent editing, and, of course, the right feel by John Williams, this film makes a world of difference.</p></body></html>

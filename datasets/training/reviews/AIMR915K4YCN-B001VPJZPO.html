Kate Hudson is Caroline, the young innocent brought into circumstances beyond her control. She goes to work in the isolated home of Violet (Gena Rowlands) and her paralyzed husband (John Hurt).

Caroline begins to suspect that something is wrong, but her rational mind won't let her accept what she fears might be happening. Her suspicions lead her deeper into the personal lives and history of the former residents of the old manor. The rest is a spooky mystery involving murder,  greed, and a supernatural plot that brings the tale to it's dark, twisty grand final&eacute;.

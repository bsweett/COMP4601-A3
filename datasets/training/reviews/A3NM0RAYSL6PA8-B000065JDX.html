<meta name="summary" content="Somebody tell Quentin he can't act!  Please!"></head><body><p>That's the only real problem with this movie. Quentin Tarantino is a silly dweeb on camera, and his effort to portray a homicidal nutcase is, well, completely laughable. You have to stand up and cheer when George Clooney knocks him unconscious.<br /><br /> This isn't Quentin's strongest dialogue either--his trademarked approach of having characters talk about all manner of things to give the story &quot;realism&quot; seems forced. Also, the directing isn't what you'd expect from a Tarantino movie--shots are at times cliche, forced, and anything but subtle. Don't get me wrong, there are some wonderfully realized scenes. But Tarantino didn't direct this, and it shows.<br /><br /> Now here's what's good. George Clooney, Harvey Keital and, yes, even Juliette Lewis turn in terrific, engaging performances. Now this isn't Shakespeare. It's Thelma and Louise meets Bonnie and Clyde meets 28 Days Later, with a humor, vampires, and a Holy Water supersoaker thrown in for good measure. Bear in mind, this is one violent, gory, and bloody film. If you've got a problem with that, go elsewhere.<br /><br /> And a review of From Dusk Till Dawn would not be complete without mentioning that Salma Hayek does a dance that is all the proof you need that she may well be the most beautiful, sexy woman in Hollywood. I never want to meet her, though, because I'm scared that when she opens her mouth she'll be dumb as a doorknob, and there's nothing sexy about that.</p></body></html>

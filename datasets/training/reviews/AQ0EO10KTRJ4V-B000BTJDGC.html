<meta name="summary" content="Laura Linney good..... film fair"></head><body><p>This COULD have been a much better movie, but suffered due to 2 problems...<br /><br />1) It was told in the reverse timeline whereas we see the ending and then have the story told to us that leads up to that ending.<br /><br />It seems this ALWAYS weakens a movie as compared to telling a story in actual sequence although "artsy" filmakers love to show off their editing skills in this way.<br /><br />2) The story is told in a court room setting.<br /><br />With the joke our legal system has become today, if you really want to sap the life out of a story, have it told thru the eyes of a bunch of lawyers.<br /><br />I think this could have been a MUCH better film if screenplayed in such a way that we saw the events unfold as they happened and never even got to the court room drama part at all !<br /><br />The court battle between lawyers became the center point of focus with the actual historical events (or variation thereof) relegated to a backdrop story.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="3.5; you should know by now how this one is"></head><body><p>The Resident Evil games, developed by Capcom, is probably my favorite franchise of the "survivor horror" genre since they were actually fun to play whereas series like Silent Hill or Fatal Frame were just simply fun to watch someone else play. The Resident Evil films, largely overseen by Paul W.S Anderson, are probably the only real decent videogame adaptations since you can enjoy them with your brain turned off whereas ones like Doom or Dead or Alive don't make the movie any better. The third film, Extinction, is just as polarizing as the 2 before it as a lot of it doesn't feel like the games yet it mentions stuff from it yet it's somehow enjoyable. Why that is, I'll never know.<br /><br />Despite the destruction via nuclear missile of Raccoon City, the T-Virus escaped and infected the rest of America and the rest of the world, leaving many turned into zombies and the lands barren wastelands. Alice, on the run since the Umbrella Corporation can track her whereabouts via satellite, is roaming the lands trying to help those in need and she comes across Claire Redfield and Carlos Olivera from Apocalypse, travelling via convoys for supplies, ammunition and a haven. But Umbrella and one of its scientists, Dr. Isaacs, wants to contain the virus and the only way to do that is by killing Alice and using for a vaccine. With hopes of an isolated haven, Alice and the others try to stay alive in the harsh heat and hunted by more deadlier enemies.<br /><br />Let's face it: the films tonally just never meshed with the games. Whereas the game franchise was built on eerie, creepy atmospheres, the films have heavy metal music, over-editing and big action scenes. But like when you were a kid and you got those cookies in the shapes of your favorite characters, it doesn't really matter what they are as long as they had familiar faces so when Carlos and Claire pop up, it's more cooler but then again the basic feel of the films feel different from the game so there's the issue. From plot holes to barely-written characters to flimsy dialogue, there's stuff to like but it's nestled right alongside tons of stuff to loathe.<br /><br />The first film is probably one of the better made of the series (again, saying the series, not film in general) but Apocalypse had more familiar fanservice nods to the games such as Carlos, Jill Valentine, Nemesis and the Ashford family and Extinction is similar and acting-wise this is never meant to be actor showcases of talent, we just need faces for our story and with Milla Jovovich, Oded Fehr and Ali Larter playing Alice, Carlos and Claire, it's easy for fans to get attached to it; it's just what the film does with it and how much you like it or hate it is the key. The effects are more seamless, the scope is more bigger, and thankfully there's more action so for the most part, if you liked the other 2, it's a good chance you'll like this one as well.<br /><br />Included with the film is a commentary as well as trailers for the games Umbrella Chronicles and Devil May Cry 4, the CG film Degeneration (which looks awesome), deleted scenes and a decent making-of on the film. It's not as stacked as most high-profile releases but it's not as barebones as most are so at least there's more stuff to dig into. As for the film itself, like a lot of videogame adaptations, it's fun to a fault and with flaws galore, they're still fun to watch...if only you could figure out why that is.</p></body></html>

I went in already a big fan of the original three Terminator films, but Terminator Salvation really does a fantastic job continuing with the series.<br /><br />It's not a secondrate or cheesy attempt in comparison to the previous three Terminator films either- it's actually really darn good.<br /><br />I admit I mostly like the Terminator films because, well first of all, they are action-packed in a way that's pretty easy to understand and follow.  I simply *enjoy* them.  I know what's going on.  It's not science fiction created in a completely confusing way.  The storyline is what it is- machines are designed to kill humans and take over the world.<br /><br />Secondly, I feel a LOT of tension whenever I think about humans trying to run away from an enormous, dangerous machine created for the sole purpose of destroying anybody that moves.  I can't tell you how many dreams I've had where I was running and hiding as much as I could ONLY for a huge machine to suddenly show up and force me to continue running.  I love it!<br /><br />As for Terminator Salvation, there's some really cool additions to the machine creatures.  I really fell in love with the robot snakes (as I like to call them, hehe).  They are actually huge metal claws that hide in the water.<br /><br />Also, let's not forget the scene out in the desert with that HUGE machine that actually has motorcycles stored as a last resort inside his legs (I kid you not!).  Apparently whenever someone is out of shooting distance for this particular machine, he opens up his legs and sends machines on motorcycles after them.  Awesome!<br /><br />The storyline is typical affair however.  You *know* what to expect.  There's nothing especially hard to grasp about what's taking place.<br /><br />Overall, with todays technology and the way Hollywood delivers action flicks these days, the action scenes involving the robots going ballistic is just incredible and seems more believable now than it did in years past.  The same remains true here.  Great movie.</p></body></html>

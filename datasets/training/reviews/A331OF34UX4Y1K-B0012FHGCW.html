<meta name="summary" content="A very good movie, in my opinion"></head><body><p>Leaving aside the two following endless controversies: how much the movie was many different or not of the book; and how much what he did was sheer stupidity or sheer idealism, I think what we have ia a very good movie.<br /><br />Well edited, great soundtrack, well acted all the way, incredible photography.

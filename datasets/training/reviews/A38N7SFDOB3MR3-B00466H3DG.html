<meta name="summary" content="Amazing Love Story"></head><body><p>I was caught off guard by this movie. I was moved to buy it. I was hit blindside by a train.<br /><br />This movie pulls off what most modern movies don't: characters you actually care about, and want to learn move about. Carrey is stunning, and Winslet pulls off her "easy to love and hate at the same time" multi-colored hair troubled woman with an amazing performance. I fell in love with Carrey and Winslet. I wanted a happy ending, and received one. No cheesy Hollywood love storie here. No cookie cutter script. Just acting that leaves you in tears.<br /><br />Brilliant. Rent it, and then buy it. While I was not a fan of Being John Malkovich, or Adaptation, because of their dry cardboard characters, this movie flies to the other end of the character spectrum and sets a wonderful standard.<br /><br />This movie leaves you yearning to jump into the film. There is no greater compliment than this.</p></body></html>

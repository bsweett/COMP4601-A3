<meta name="summary" content="Stunning achievement for Mr. Eastwood"></head><body><p>It is common knowledge that each of us reads a novel from our own unique perspective. Many reviewers have commented on Eastwood's faithfullness to the novel but I have never seen a book put to film seemingly from my own perspective until now. I have never been a believer in "channeling", but the notion fleeted across my mind when viewing this movie. Perhaps not all credit should go to Mr. Eastwood as whoever cast this movie chose actors that my "minds eye" seemed to invisage when reading the novel.<br />The actors performed incredibly, the score was excellent, just a tremendous movie to a surreal degree.</p></body></html>

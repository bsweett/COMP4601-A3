Great Story."></head><body><p>Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />This film from the director of SPY KIDS Robert Rodriguez is very entertaining. It has a great storyline, and promises not one, but TWO, sequels. If you loved KILL BILL, you'll love MACHETE. Plenty of blood-drenching action, sexy women and excellent acting. I recommend it.</p></body></html>

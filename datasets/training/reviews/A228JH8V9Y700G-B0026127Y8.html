<meta name="summary" content="Take heed, young travelers ..."></head><body><p>An urban legend comes to life!  Young girls (and boys) should watch this as a precautionary tale to anyone who is going to travel abroad or domestic, or when you meet a stranger here or there.<br /><br />Liam Neeson plays a semi absentee father who has been working as a highly trained operative on missions around the world.  His time away from home cost him his marriage, now his teenage daughter has asked through his ex wife to take a trip to Europe.  At first she tells him that they will be going to museums and doing touristy things, but he finds just before she leaves that they are really going to travel across Europe to see U2 on the European leg of their tour.  Reluctanly, he agrees (even though he is angry that his daughter and his ex wife lied about it to him) and signs the papers to allow her to travel.  In typical law enforcement manner, Liam demands that his daughter call and let him know where she is at all times.  His daughter and her friend, however, being the stereotypical flaky teenagers they are, say hello to a random stranger they meet at the airport.  He seems friendly enough, offers to share a cab to their destination, then gets their phone number.  Little do they know they are being lured into a trap.  And what a trap it is!  In a panic, his daughter tells her father on the phone that they are being kidnapped.  Liam immediately jumps onto a plane and heads to Paris to track his daughter down from the sex slavery ring she has been lured into.<br /><br />The older I get, the more I see the signifigance of a story like that.  Having traveled abroad and been hassled and hustled by many a suave European man, be cautious.  You never know who is going to take you for a ride.  They may not be pulling you into sex slavery, but they are looking for something else.  And it also happens right here in the US, in your own backyard.  I have several friends in law enforcement, they question everything and anything I do.  "DO you know that man you were talking to over there?" "Yes, I know him from ___".  Paranoid?  It has merit.  A stranger is not just a friend you haven't met, you must be very careful with people with what you do and say, because you simply do not know what others are capable of or what they are after.  As a kid, you do not believe that people will treat you like a piece of meat, but they will.  Just wait until it happens to you.<br /><br />Some words of criticism?  It was a bit hoaky that Liam would actually find his daughter with all the hoops he had to jump through.  Granted, he plays a spy who had access to certain information that the average person would not otherwise.  But, after all, this is entertainment about a not so pleasent subject.<br /><br />Be warned, kids, the world is a crazy and dangerous place.  Be tough, street smart, and keep up a shield.  You will need it.</p></body></html>

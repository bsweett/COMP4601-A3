<meta name="summary" content="Truth can be stranger than fiction"></head><body><p>A sympathetic story about a hooker from Florida with lesbian instincts. She tries to go straight, but society turns her into a serial killer. She executes her johns in their cars with a .44 magnum. No this isn't a made for TV movie on the LifeTime Network for Women, this is Monster. The story of a real female serial killer from Daytona Beach.<p>Surprisingly little nudity in this, but a lot of sexual undercurrents. Aileen is clearly a little loopy to begin with, but being hit unconscious and tied to a car door and then being sodomized by a wooden stake throws her over the edge. Her naive 'partner' gets caught up in the murder and mayhem, and by chance is responsible for Aileen's arrest. A chance turn taken too fast throws them into the front yard of an elderly couple who fingers them later and gets their pictures on the TV. <p>The actors were all brilliant in this, not just the star and her partner, but the johns were cool too. You got the retarded type guy who's life is spared and gets a handjob to boot. Then you got the Good Samaritan who tries to help her, but is executed on his knees. <p>For those who cannot get enough of Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy, try Monster for a change of pace.</p></body></html>

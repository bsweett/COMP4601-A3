She ended up blowing guys for five bucks in the back seat of their cars, living out of a storage room, taking baths in the sinks of public restrooms and trying to survive. She has really nothing to cheer her up, until one day she walks into a gay bar and meets Selby (Christina Ricci). They quickly become friends and even more, but not before Aileen recanted some statements she made due to her being a compulsive liar.<br /><br />When things go south with one of her clients, Aileen ends up killing the man after being brutally abused. From that point on we can see her rage towards her clients and her desire to "punish" them for being what they are. Or maybe she is angry with herself for having to do this job and takes it out on them. She does try to change paths though, mainly due to her love for Selby. She wants to take care of her partner's need, but finds no help whatsoever when looking for a job. So, back to the old work...and hello serial killer.<br /><br />There are several things about this movie that make it brilliant, with Theron's performance right at the top of the list. For an actress that is usually involved in representing classy and beautiful women, it must be a real challenge to play the role of Aileen. Part of the credit has to go to the make-up artists though, who made possible an incredible transformation.<br /><br />The other point that I think is worth mentioning is the quality of the script, since the story takes us inside the mind of the serial killer. It is fascinating to understand the motives and reasons behind her actions. I can understand though that people that have been touched by the effects of Wuornos' crimes are not interested in this and may resent it. Also, I am not sure about how much of what is presented is fiction. In my mind, even if part of the "facts" presented are fiction, this movie is a high quality creation and a very interesting option to consider the next time you plan to sit in front of the TV for a couple of hours.</p></body></html>

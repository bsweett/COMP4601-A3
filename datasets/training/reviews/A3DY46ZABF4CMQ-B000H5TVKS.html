<meta name="summary" content="...doesn't come close to the original"></head><body><p>Saw was a horror film with a good storyline and an excellent twist at the end. Saw II, however, doesn't come close to the original.<br /><br />The sequel introduces a new character Eric Matthews, played by former New Kid on the Block Donnie Wahlberg, a cop with a grudge who has just had a falling out with his son. Jigsaw attacks once again and this time it's Matthew's son who's in the torture chamber with a group of convicts that Matthews put away.<br /><br />Unlike the original, the script for Saw II seems like it wasn't revised enough. The characters aren't given much background study even though Jigsaw is finally introduced as an old man dying of cancer, but the torture scenes, especially the one at the beginning of the film, are horrific.<br /><br />Fans of the original and horror films in general might find Saw II quite entertaining. But the film's staleness and silly character buildup makes the original much more entertaining.<br /><br />Mildly recommended<br /><br />C</p></body></html>

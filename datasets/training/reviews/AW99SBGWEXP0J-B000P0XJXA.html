<meta name="summary" content="Spartan"></head><body><p>Marine operative Scott (Kilmer) is selected to help find the kidnapped daughter of a politician.  He is given 48 hours to do this before the media gets wind of the story and runs with it.  Aided by Curtis (Luke), he dives into an investigation that takes new twists and turns with each new bit of data they recover.  It seems that the reason for the kidnapping might not be what everyone thinks, but that doesn't mean the the girl is not in danger.  And as he draws closer to finding her, other forces begin to work against him to actively prevent him from succeeding.  Director David Mamet has constructed an interesting tale with motivations that are sadly believeable in today's age.  Spartan is an interesting film that is not afraid to slam the politics of today's world.</p></body></html>

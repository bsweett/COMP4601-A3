<meta name="summary" content="Good movie"></head><body><p>I like this movie. Specially the part when the family and their guest are sitting down at the dinner table and the ghost, Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davis), make Della (Catherine O'Hara), start sing a song. Then Adam and Barbara make everyone join in with a dance. Very funny stuff. I also like Beetlejuice, Michael Keaton. I think they picked the right person to play Beetlejuice.</p></body></html>

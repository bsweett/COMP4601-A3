<meta name="summary" content="If You Believed They Put a Man on the Moon"></head><body><p>Last month I watched <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QW7AJY">Pandorum</a> about a couple of guys seemingly stranded in deep space that find themselves in a very confusing situation. And I suggested that Pandorum was reminiscent of the classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H5U5EE">Twilight Zone</a> series. While Moon's story is completely different and unique, I would venture to say that I was again reminded of The Twilight Zone, and it is about a guy in space--on the Moon to be exact--that finds himself in a very confusing situation.<br /><br />Moon is a one man show...well, that's not exactly correct, but you'll have to see the movie to see what I mean. Sam Bell played by Sam Rockwell has a three year mission on the moon to oversee a mega corporation's mining operation that runs mostly on autopilot. While the autopilot of the mining operation keeps production flowing, and the base where Sam is housed has a mainframe with the AI of...well...of Kevin Spacey, Sam is needed to perform tasks that only a human could complete. But what if something unexpected happened to Sam?<br /><br />When I first heard about this movie I wrote it off as one of those films that was sure to be a psychological drama about a guy that go nuts from an extended solitary mission in space. Okay, Moon may ultimately have a tad bit of that, but by far Moon is a movie with much much more. Rockwell's acting is great. The movie never gets boring and is in fact quite suspenseful at times. Simply put: Moon is a great movie.<br /><br />And where was Sam Rockwell's nomination for Best Actor? I mean the guy completely carries Moon with a little voiceover help from Kevin Spacey.<br /><br />If you believe there's nothing up my sleeve, you've got to see Moon.</p></body></html>

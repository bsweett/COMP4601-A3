It is about a future existence where the sense of feeling has been not only outlawed and banned, there is a drug to sedate and subdue it that is required by law at a daily dose level to maintain the sanctity of having no feelings about anything whatsoever for any reason.<br />What makes this movie powerful is the onslaught of political correctness in society, and the forced adherence to "diversity" being a coerced requirement for continued employment at most workplaces, as well as getting right down to harassment policies where even an overly stern or "mean" stare is considered grounds for disciplinary action up to and including dismissal; because no one should have to endure a hostile work environment or feel emotionally uncomfortable by peers and especially not by superiors.  The boot camp experience for military inductees for the first time in history now equips the raw buck private rank newcomer with "timeout" cards so they can get distance between themselves and a drill sergeant they perceive is being too aggressive.  These are happening NOW here in America, not in some fantasy film about the future.<br />So getting back to the movie, we see an enforcer (called a Priest) who exacts his duties with weapons and martial arts skills.  There are no penalties for deadly force when arresting those who have chosen not to take the government's required drug to avoid having feelings.  Any item of sentimental value or object causing feelings or arousal of the senses in any definition, are to be destroyed immediately or turned into the repository back at headquarters for evidence so the guilty parties of human beings can be cremated alive.<br />This film flat out rocks.  If you have any concept at all about government censure of the true nature of human experience beyond the more obvious stuff like strong indications the perpetrator has lost their moral compass, then you realize the magnitude and relevance of this film.  If you exercise self-restraint far, far beyond what you want to so you can keep your job, or your fellowship elsewhere, then this movie "Equilibrium" resounds into the marrow of your bones.<br />The John Preston character portrayed by Christian Bale is one of the best Sci-Fi / Fantasy roles ever brought to the screen.  There is no way Keanu Reeves could have pulled this role off as well.  No way.<br />This movie is said to be a primer for the "Matrix" series of films.  I just call it one of my top five favorite movies of all time.  If this movie was on the floor I'd roll all around on it like a dog trying to get the scent of a fresh kill on themselves.  This movie knocks all the others like it stone cold dead.<br />Favorite scenes?  The last 20 minutes of this film.  Oh yeah.  5 stars.</p></body></html>

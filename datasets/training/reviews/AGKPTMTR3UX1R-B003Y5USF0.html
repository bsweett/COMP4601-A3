<meta name="summary" content="Sometimes I go about in pity for myself, and all the while a great wind is bearing me across the sky---Ojibwa Saying"></head><body><p>What makes TWISTER such an enjoyable film isn't the individual actors' portrayals (though two of the cast, Helen Hunt and Phillip Seymour Hoffman went on to win Oscars for other films), but rather the sense of mad exuberance that permeates this film, much like another Hoffman vehicle, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00320J6WS">Pirate Radio</a>. Although the "divorcing couple" plotline holds no surprises, the rest of the film does. TWISTER is a rush.<br /><br />Bill (Bill Paxton) and Jo (Helen Hunt) are two storm-chasing meterorologists in northern Oklahoma. They are the couple who are on the cusp of divorce. As a matter of fact, Bill has returned to rural Oklahoma from his job in the city as a TV meteorologist to force Jo's hand into signing the divorce papers, and he's brought his fiancee Melissa (Jami Gertz), a psychotherapist, along as proof that the marriage is truly ended. Predictably, of course it isn't, and once Jo and Bill see each other their relationship, as tempestuous as a twister, begins anew, leaving Melissa to blow in the wind.<br /><br />What isn't so predictable is the pirate energy of Jo and Bill's storm-chasing crew. Nominally a group of scientists, they're really a bunch of adrenaline junkies who get off on putting themselves in harm's way. Jo, for her part, has an Ahabian obsession to conquer tornadoes, since she lost her father to one.<br /><br />Jo, both sexy and ramshackle in her wife-beater top and chinos, reflects her crew perfectly. Their vehicles are dented and battered. They're ballcap wearing, mullet-headed geniuses who whoop and holler ever louder as storms toss farmhouses into the air ("We're in the suck zone! Yeah!") and fix their ratty equipment with baling wire and chewing gum. They hate Jason (Cary Elwes) a rival storm-chaser who has sold out by accepting corporate sponsorship and drives shiny new Hummers with all the fixings and a Doppler radar you can see your face in. Both groups have developed a new technology to inject sensors into storms (Jo's homemade "Dorothy" and Jason's factory milled "Dot"), and it's a race to see who does it first.<br /><br />A veritable conga line of tornadoes begins to spawn, and the crew races headlong over the area trying to "study" them.  Bill joins them, despite his promises to Melissa. Melissa is in hysterics after Bill's truck gets spun like a top by three nearby waterspouts, but Bill and Jo are both exhilarated. Melissa, seeing how the wind is blowing, ends the engagement.<br /><br />The crew dash to the town of Wakita, where Jo's p*ss-and-vinegar Aunt Meg lives, to stoke up on food. As they eat, they hear of an F5 tornado, the most powerful type, in the area, and pile pell-mell out the door to find it. It finds them first, and devastates Wakita, but the huge F5 storm provides some of the best CGI disaster footage ever, as gasoline tankers and combines fly like matchsticks, a cow jumps over the moon, and houses implode. The cow is an inspired addition, the signature of this picture. (TWISTER was also the first-ever DVD release and the last-ever DVD-HD release, and the second highest-grossing film of 1996.) All ends relatively well, though nobody in the picture is ever really down to earth.  Particularly the cow.<br /><br />A great light film that will have you hopping in your seat, TWISTER is well worth owning.</p></body></html>

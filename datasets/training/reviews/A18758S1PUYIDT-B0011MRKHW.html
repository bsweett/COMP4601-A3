<meta name="summary" content="Why did they bother except possibly for a costuming award?"></head><body><p>Oh, the costumes look fabulous.  Ditto the set design and locations.  But come on...Elizabeth comes off as shrill, petty, obsessive, and hysterical here, while Walsingham pops up now and then as a prop.  Sir Walter Raleigh is somewhat interesting, as is the queen's favorite lady, Bess--but the story isn't supposed to be about them, is it?<br />It's also incredibly irritating to watch scene after scene of actors being filmed through frosted glass. Apparently the director and cinematographer couldn't think of anything else to do.<br />The whole film comes off as surprisingly dull, given the potential strength of the subject matter.  Too bad.</p></body></html>

New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) is visiting his wife where she works in the Nakatomi Building in an attempt to resolve their marital issues.  John is apparently the only one paying attention when a group of men take over the whole building and hold a large group of people hostage, including John's wife Holly Gennero McClane (Bonnie Bedelia).  Being an intelligent take action kind of guy, John immediately sets out to try and see if he can do something.  He also quickly realizes that he is outgunned and outnumbered.<br /><br />John does something you rarely see in action films; he calls for help.  However, the police he calls with a radio stolen from the bad guys suspect he could be a terrorist or kidnapper, as they have described the men in the building.  John is really struggling to get any support as the authorities tell him they have everything under control and that he should stay in a safe place while they handle the situation.<br /><br />Several things happen to make us realize the authorities are far from having the situation under control.  The police send in an armored vehicle which the suspected terrorists blow up with an anti-tank missile.  The FBI arrives to take charge and follow their standard playbook in dealing with the terrorists, which also turns out to be another mistake.  A helicopter is sent in with a SWAT team and it too is neatly dispatched.  The "authorities" come across as bumbling and ineffective.<br /><br />John realizes that the authorities have little such and of course he has already decided to take action himself.  However, John is no iron man Chuck Norris.  John gets cut-up, blown-up, banged-up and is continually on the run from the terrorists.  John does get lucky more than once, but there is some plausibility in his luck.  John also gets unlucky more than once.  John struggles to make headway with the terrorists as he is typically outgunned, but he keeps his head and manages to stay alive, which in this movie turns out to be really difficult.<br /><br />Bruce Willis does an outstanding job as vulnerable hero John McClane.  John is far from being a superman, making numerous mistakes that get him hurt and cause significant damage to the building.  He is very human, as is revealed throughout the course of the building.  He often does not know what to do next, and he does get scared.  His type of hero is much more real than the stoic iron man often depicted in movies of this type.  He has real life problems, including a wife from whom he is separated and children.<br /><br />The supporting cast is remarkable.  Alan Rickman plays Hans Gruber, the leader of the bad guys.  Hans is borderline psychotic and has everything meticulously planned out, except for the intervention of John McClane.  When Hans threatens Holly, who ultimately takes a leadership role amongst the hostages - no shrinking wallflower she, John gets really angry, which of course is one of John's motivations for dealing firmly with the terrorists.  Reginald VelJohnson plays Los Angeles cop Sgt. Al Powell, another down-to-earth family man who believes what John says and supports him even when his boss and the FBI do not.  While there are a few moments when the interaction between John and Al gets a bit maudlin, the pairing is effective.<br /><br />William Atherton plays Richard Thornburg, a caricature of a tabloid journalist of the type we all like to hate, and we quickly come to dislike Richard Thornburg.  Richard is being set up for a rather predictable and enjoyable scene near the end of the movie.<br /><br />Action movies have certain characteristics that often make them predictable.  We know that the bad guys are really bad.  We know that the authorities are ineffective for one of a host of reasons.  We know that there will be one man who overcomes the odds to defeat the bad guys.  This one man seems bullet-proof and all-knowing as he avoids getting killed.  This man is generally unemotional except to the innocent.  Bruce Willis helped to redefine the hero of action movies as someone who meets none of these requirements.<br /><br />While Bruce Willis was creating a vulnerable hero we are entertained by a well-plotted movie that has a number of surprises, including why the terrorists are in the building and how they plan to escape.  I was entranced as much by the mysteries in this movie as by the action.  This movie is a winner for the combination of action, intelligent plot, and character development.  Try "Die Hard" as an alternative to mindless action movies where the main character never does wrong, never gets hurt, and has way too much ammunition.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Gay Perry!"></head><body><p>I thought that this movie was really funny. It wasn't the greatest movie ever made but for a comedy it was smart, unpredictable and different. This is something that is a rarity these days as most comedies are stupid and confuse vulgarity and shock for humor. Robert Downey and Val Kilmer as Gay Perry are both excellent choices for their roles and do a very good job. The dialouge is smart, quick and funny.<br /><br />I recommend this movie highly. Check it out!</p></body></html>

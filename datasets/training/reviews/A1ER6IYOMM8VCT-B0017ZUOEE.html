<meta name="summary" content="MORE SAD THAN SCARY!"></head><body><p>Surprisingly restrained considering the trailer had so many threatening and spooky images. I will say that 'The Orphanage' does get an A for atmosphere, but reading subtitles during this film distracted me from the experience. I usually pass on films with subtitles, but this film seemed too good to pass up and there are always exceptions to the rule. It's a pretty easy film to follow, even though this was played up to be a very spooky film, I found it to be more sad than scary. The DVD transfer looks very good and this is worth seeing, but maybe rent before buying it.</p></body></html>

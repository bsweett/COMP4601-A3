<meta name="summary" content="One of the best plot twists ever"></head><body><p>"Laura" is a murder mystery which contains one of the best and most surprising plot twists ever. I don't want to go into any more detail about the plot, as it might spoil it for you. I saw this film for the first time, on late night television, about 20 years ago and have seen it numerous times since. I consider it to be among my favourite films of all time. It is not just the plot twists that makes it a great film, but also the characters and the actors who play them: the arrogant and sarcastic Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), who is one of my family's favourite fictitious characters; and the enigmatic Laura (Gene Tierney) who might not be as nice as she initially appears.<br /><br />"Laura" is based on a book by Vera Caspary, which I also highly recommend. The movie follows the book reasonably closely, but in a number of ways improves on the book. I see the movie as being a darker version of its source material.<br /><br />This is one of the lesser known film noir films, but is by no means lesser in quality or entertainment value. I highly recommend this film to any fans of the noir genre or to fans of mysteries in general.</p></body></html>

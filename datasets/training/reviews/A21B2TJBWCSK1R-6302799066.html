<meta name="summary" content="Still relevant after all these years..."></head><body><p>With the recent events in Iraq and the current state of leadership in the White House, Stanley Kubrick's savage black comedy about nuclear war, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the Bomb, is more relevant than ever. It makes perfect sense then, that the folks at Sony-Columbia have re-released this movie on DVD (this is its third incarnation). However, for folks who bought the excellent special edition released three years ago, is it really worth the upgrade?<br /><br />One of the new extras on this 2-DVD set is "No Fighting in the War Room or: Dr. Strangelove and the Nuclear Threat," an impressive 30-minute documentary that examines the social and political conditions that inspired and helped shape the film.<br /><br />"Inside Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb" is an excellent, in-depth 46-minute documentary on the making of Kubrick's masterpiece. This is a fascinating look at how Strangelove came to be with lots of information and eye-witness accounts from the cast and crew that are still alive.<br /><br />"Best Sellers or: Peter Sellers and Dr. Strangelove" is another new addition and examines the comedic genius of this talented actor. Shirley MacLaine, Roger Ebert and Michael Palin gush about Sellers but the real treat here is rare, vintage home movie footage of the young comedian honing his craft.<br /><br />"The Art of Stanley Kubrick: From Short Films to Strangelove" is a solid profile of Kubrick from his humble beginnings as photographer in New York City to his work on Strangelove. This is a very well done overview of Kubrick's early career but those hungry for more should really check out the superb feature-length documentary on the Kubrick box set.<br /><br />Another new extra is "An Interview with Robert McNamara" that runs 24 minutes. He talks at length about the real people and events that informed Kubrick's film. McNamara comes off as a little dry at this length and was more palatable in the digestible soundbites on the other extras.<br /><br />There is also "Split Screen Interviews with Peter Sellers and George C. Scott" that were done on the set of Strangelove for promotional purposes.<br /><br />Finally, there is a "Theatrical Advertising Gallery," which showcases the provocative ad campaign for the movie at the time.<br /><br />Dr. Strangelove is a nightmare comedy about annihilation. For the satire of the film to work, we must be distanced from the seriousness of the subject. In effect, by the film's end, we have learned to "love the bomb" as the film's title suggests, by giving into the comic, satirical nature of the movie. Kubrick's film is eerily relevant now because much of what he was mocking still exists. President George W. Bush is a mixture of the gung-ho, might-make-right of General Ripper and the cowboy antics of Major Kong, with the bumbling incompetence of President Muffley. The new extra material is quite good but not really worth double-dipping unless you are a dedicated fan of this movie. However, for newcomers, this is the version to get.</p></body></html>

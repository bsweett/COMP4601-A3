The film lacked finesse - there's an art to even bad horror films and a fine line between an homage and ineptitude. Zombie had lots of great ideas but they simply didn't gel on screen.<br /><br />All is forgiven with The Devil's Rejects.  Zombie wisely dumps the Dr. Satan angle (whose appearance was the film's "jump the chainsaw" moment) and instead focuses on creating a movie that's focused, violent, vile, and lyrical all at the same time.  It's a 70s homage, complete with grainy film and little makeup.  By firmly placing his film in the 70s, unlike the first which could have happened anywhere, Zombie brings surprising freshness to the standard inbred family of serial killers.  In a twist that determines much of the film's narrative, the Firefly clan gets exactly what it deserves. Or does it?<br /><br />See, The Devil's Rejects is a road trip movie about a bunch of free spirits who do whatever they want to whomever they want whenever they want.  Only in the counterculture 70s could this message seem appealing as our anti-heroes fight The Man.  And The Man comes aknockin' with machineguns and body armor led by the maniacal Sheriff Wydell (William Forsythe).  Wydell spirals madness in his quest to avenge the death of his brother, Lieutenant George Wydell, murdered in the first film. All pretenses of justice are cast aside as he hires mercenaries to track the Firefly clan, uses torture to elicit confessions, and even resorts to the murder of a helpless woman.  The real villain, says director and producer Zombie, is any one of us if we're pushed too far.<br /><br />But you might have a different interpretation.  Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) is a disgusting clown who isn't above robbing mothers and terrorizing children.  Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie, who doesn't laugh at all in this movie, a wise move) is a tease who uses her looks to lure men to their deaths.  Otis B. Driftwood (Bill Moseley) is an unrepentant serial killer who skins men alive. Collectively, these three helped kill over a thousand people.  They are bad people meeting a bad end, and though Wydell's methods are hardly lawful, they are most certainly just.<br /><br />And therein lay Zombie's genius.  By the end of the film Spaulding, Baby, and Otis have been beaten, tortured, and harassed. When Otis has nails hammered through his palms, is he the Devil thrashing in hell or a Christ-like figure suffering his way towards redemption? Should we be rooting for the bad guys, the way we root for Freddy and Jason?  Or should we be condemning them to the same kinds of tortures that the Firefly clan inflicted on their victims?  How vicious a punishment must be inflicted before it's considered just?<br /><br />Zombie gives no answers.  He simply sends three serial killers to their logical end with dignity they might not deserve.  And along the way you can't help but admire Zombie's artistry in creating a tale that, no matter which side you come down on, keeps you watching right until the last shot is fired.</p></body></html>

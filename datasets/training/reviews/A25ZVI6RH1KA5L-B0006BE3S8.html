Predator (2004)...seems for many reviewers, the second part of that statement holds true, although not in the context those who made the film meant it to be taken, and that's too bad, especially since many of us have waited some 14 years for this event to reach the silver screen, first taking notice of the possibility while watching Predator 2 (1990) starring Danny Glover (I would have liked to been in that casting meeting...'We can't get Arnold Schwarzenegger for the Predator sequel, so who's our next logical choice?  Danny Glover?'...in his defense, he was a hot property, appearing in Lethal Weapon 2 a year earlier).  The sequel was certainly mediocre, but the ending, with the appearance of the Alien skull in the trophy room (and the illusion that someone someday would make a film worthy of these two monumental characters), almost made the whole experience worthwhile (actually, those of us who read comics throughout the 90's were treated to a number of Predator/Alien match ups, which really only served to fuel the fire).  Written and directed by Paul `You either love him or hate him' Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon, Resident Evil), the film stars the very curvaceous Sanaa Lathan (Blade), the extremely Italian Raoul Bova (Under the Tuscan Sun), and the always crusty Lance Henriksen (Near Dark, Pumpkinhead, Alien?).<br /><br />At the start of the film we see a satellite, own by the Weyland Corporation, orbiting the Earth, taking pictures, focusing on an area in the Antarctic.  Thermal imaging indicates a large power source sitting underneath a ancient pyramid (all under 2,000 feet of ice), which peaks uber rich industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland's (Henriksen) interest enough to warrant a full scale expedition, and so begins the gathering of various specialists together, including ice climber and guide extraordinaire Alexa `Lex' Woods (Lathan) and archeologist Sebastian de Rosa (Bova), among others...but they're not the only ones making the trip, as we also see a Predator spacecraft arriving into Earth's orbit.  The expedition does find the subterranean pyramid, but their presence activates the emergence of a shackled Queen Alien, who begins laying gooey eggs as part of some as of yet undefined process that will eventually include not only the humans, but the Predators as well.  What's the purpose of the pyramid, and how are the Predators and Aliens involved?  Well, I could tell you, but I don't think that would be fair to those who haven't seen the film (I purposely avoided reading anything about this film, as I wanted to go into it `fresh'.)<br /><br />So, was our lengthy wait for a Predator/Alien match up justified with this film?  According to many the answer would be no...and, for the most part, I would tend to agree.  The main problem is, in my opinion, that expectations were very high, so high in fact many had doubts prior to the film even before it was released.  I, on the other hand, came into this movie with limited expectations, and still was a trifle disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, I really liked the fight scenes between the Aliens and Predators, what little of it there was (it takes almost a full hour before we first see the two tussle)...and the creatures effects were handled very well...there were just so many inconsistencies in the story.  One problem, among many, was the gestation and subsequent maturation of the aliens themselves...prior Alien films indicated this wasn't a process that took only a couple of hours (as in this film), but at least a day or two...maybe these were aliens of the `quick gro' variety.  Also, what was the point of the interior of the pyramid changing its' configuration every ten minutes?  The only reason I could think of was because it was in the script...and the film indicates Aliens and Predators have been on the Earth for hundreds, if not thousands of years...how come no one had found evidence of this prior to the events in this film?  Okay, I can see how the Predators, with their advanced technology, could keep their arrival on Earth a secret given our current state of technology (via the use of cloaking devices, I suppose), but what about when they fired that intense laser beam from space, melting a giant hole 2,000 feet through the ice to access the pyramid?  Seems to be if we can detect a comparatively minimal heat source beneath the pyramid, we should also be able to detect the sustained laser blast, if not the source...the story is full of stuff like this, things that just don't make sense.  The acting wasn't bad, but the human characters are lifeless and serve no purpose other than to facilitate the story...I know, I know, the human element isn't what we came to see in this film, so their role is in accordance to the story, but I would ask why have them in the movie at all?  Just give me the Aliens and Predators...imagine that, and entire film with these two alien species, no dialogue at all...that would have been interesting.  Anderson's direction is passable, but borders on shoddy more than I would have liked.  Oh, and let's not forget the PG-13 rating...strange that the individual films featuring the Aliens and Predators were all R rated, and yet a meeting between the two would be reduced to kid friendly material.  All in all I'd call this a film of missed opportunities worth renting for a few scenes, but not much else.<br /><br />The picture looks good (some scenes were a bit murky, though), and the special features are listed on Amazon, so I won't bother rehashing them...one thing I found annoying about the extras was the amount of plugging by Fox...just gimme the film, for crying out loud, and quite trying to bury me in all your promotional junk.<br /><br />Cookieman108</p></body></html>

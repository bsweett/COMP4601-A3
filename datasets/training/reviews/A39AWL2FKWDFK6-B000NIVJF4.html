<meta name="summary" content="Disturbing fictionalized portrayal of a madman"></head><body><p>Forest Whitaker was chillingly outstanding in his portrayal of the fiendish and sometimes charming embodiment of the devil himself Ugandan despot Idi Amin.  Directed by Scotsman Kevin Macdonald, "The Last King of Scotland" filmed with breathtaking cinematography in Uganda chronicles the rise to power of Amin through the eyes of young doctor Nicholas Garrigan.<br /><br />Garrigan played by James McAvoy, was a naive, idealistic newly graduated physician who set out to Africa with the idea of helping the needy in a rural Ugandan clinic.  As a result of a chance meeting with newly annointed Amin, Garrigan becomes his personal physician and confidante.  Much to the dismay of the Brits who let Amin ascend to power, Garrian kowtows to Amin and gets on the program, being elevated to a high ministerial position.<br /><br />Seduced by the power bestowed upon him by Amin, the young doctor is blinded to the corruption of Amin's regime which has degenerated into one of torture and genocide.  Too late he realizes his mistake but is unable to leave the country being shackled by Amin and he begins to fear for his life.<br /><br />Director Macdonald takes some liberties with history but nonetheless provides a disquieting window into the morass into which Uganda was plunged by the dangerous policies orchestrated by the crazed and paranoid Amin.<br /><br />Simon McBurney playing Nigel Stone, a British foreign officer stationed in Uganda was very good in his role as was Kerry Washington playing Kay Amin.  Whitaker's performance however, was so superlative that it made McAvoy's seem pedestrian by comparison.</p></body></html>

I can't believe this movie is directed by Brian De Plama (Carrie, Dressed to Kill). He must have been desperate to direct this crap. Hilary Swank's acting is actually worse than Jost Hartnett's. The plot goes nowhere, the nude scenes are embarrassing, and the movie is shot in complete blackness, I could hardly make out a scene. I couldn't find one person who enjoyed this filth. The Black Dahlia is one of the worst films of 2006, now I know why this movie did horrible in the theaters.</p></body></html>

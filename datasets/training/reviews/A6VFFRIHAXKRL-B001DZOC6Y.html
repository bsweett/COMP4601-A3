<meta name="summary" content="Did this "Happen" to be good. WHAT NOOO." 3.5/10"></head><body><p>The Happening "Happens" to be a very half @zzed  movie directed by M. Night Shyamalan he directed the 6th Sense which I like Unbreakable which I enjoy but he also directed Signs which if you see that movie you'll be like no wonder Mel Gibson's psycho now. Most recently he directed The Last Air Bender so his recent track record hasn't been good at all. Happening starring Mark Wahlberg as Elliot Moore & Mark this was your worst performance you have ever given. Zooey Deschanel as Alma Moore she was boring. John Leguizamo as Julian he has a daughter Jess played by Ashlyn Sanchez they give better perfomances even these 2 teenage actor that I've never heard of give better perfomances. Then you have Betty Buckly as Mrs. Jones. The movie starts off decent in Centeral Park & people are killing themselves. But boy oh boy does the idea of a neat interesting plot become a big cluster fv**  Elliot Moore is a High School Science teacher & his friend Julian works as a Math teacher they're told that some terrorist attack has happened & they need to evacate until it stops so Elliot his wife Alma, Julian & his daughter Jess are taking a train to get far away from the North East but the train has stopped cause it lost communication wtf? They leave these poeple stranded Julian decides to go to Princton NJ to find his wife. Now if you like John Leguizamo he dies. You like Mark Wahlberg he gives the worst performance. So there's a scene with this Soldier & he tells them that everybody offed thereselves at the base he's told that there are more people dead down the road his reaction is "Oh cheese & crackers." WTF? Then we have these 2 teen boys get there heads blown off with a shot gun. Then they go to this old ladies house Mrs. Jones definitly not how Billy Paul described her. Ok this lady is I don't care about her character at the dinner table that little girl Jess is going to get a biscuit & that b!**h  smacks her hand. Then the best part & this is on you tube type The Happening what no. This Lady is really mad at Marky Mark she says. "You plan on stealing from me." Marky Mark " No mam I'm not." Mrs.Jones: "Plan on murdering me in my sleep." Marky Mark. "What NOOOO." Oh & I was happy when Mrs. Jones died I don't care about her or pretty much anybody in the movie so why should. Ok the ending is decent Elliot & Alma adopt Jess & Alma is pregnet. But it shows the same thing "Happening." LOL in Europe. Mark Wahlberg this is the worst performance I've ever seen you give I mean I liked him in RM & Shooter. Zooey Daschanel bleh. Betty Buckly I don't care about John Leguizamo was decent Ashlyn Sanchez was decent too. People talk $#!* about The Blair Witch Project which was made on a shoestring budget & actors that at least came off as real people they weren't great but at least Heather Danahue, Josh Leonard & Michael Williams came off as real people. The Happening has a $48 million budget & just is pathetic & acting should be natural & Marky Mark gives a bad performance. Interesting idea terrible execution 1st they think it's terrorists then it's plants & trees communicate with each other then they communicate with insects then it's the air. People whined over The Expendables about Oh the plot wasn't deep at least it was straight forward. Good night this movie was awful but no wonder it was released by 20th Century Fox there recent track record hasn't been good.</p></body></html>

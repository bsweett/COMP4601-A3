Musical biopics have been made for several performers but this is the only one I have watched that examines the life of the man who popularized such classics as Mack the Knife, Splish Splash, Dream Lover, and many others.<br /><br />Several aspects of this movie make it different from other music biopics and some of them may not be to everyone's liking. One of the major parts of the movie involves actor William Ulrich who plays Bobby Darin as a young boy. Throughout the film, Ulrich pops into the scene in the movie and talks to Bobby Darin and discusses the film, talks about his life, and reminds the older version of himself about some of the important things he learned from his family members. This addition to the movie seemed a little odd at first and I wasn't sure what to think about it. I got used to it after a while, but I don't know if it was the best way to make a movie about Bobby Darin's life. It was ripe with symbolism and it related to the other parts of the movie but I know that many will not like this part of the film and it is one of the few areas where movie critics came down hard against Beyond the Sea. Another thing that some may not like is the fact that Kevin Spacey was about 45 years old when he made this movie yet he is portraying a man who was 10 to 25 years younger. Spacey might have done better to make this movie about ten or fifteen years ago when he looked even more like the real Bobby Darin.<br /><br />Another unusual part of this movie- but one that i liked- was the fact that it includes elements of a musical production rather than just an ordinary movie. Every music biopic includes musical performances, so this is nothing new. But what is interesting is director Kevin Spacey's decision to include small parts of the movie that are like a Broadway musical or opera (where the script is sung, not spoken). I liked this idea and I felt that it added a new dimension to the movie that you don't normally see in a biopic. I should point out that most of these musical moments were during the surreal sequences that involved Bobby talking to himself as a little boy. But I still thought they were good for the overall enjoyment of the film due to the songs and the entertaining dance routines.<br /><br />Let's now talk about the performances because at least one of them is superb. I am talking about, of course, Kevin Spacey in the lead role as Bobby Darin. Spacey is an excellent actor who has won a couple of Oscars so it shouldn't surprise anyone that his performance would be better than average. What is surprising, however, is how excellent Spacey is at performing in this role. Not only does he have the look, the mannerisms, and the personality of Bobby Darin, he can sing and dance, too. I was shocked to discover later that Spacey sings all of the songs in this movie! To hear him sing, you would swear you are listening to Bobby Darin. I thought for sure some of the songs were lip- synced but they are not. And then there is the dancing. Spacey shows how multi- talented he is in front of a camera in the many dance routines in this movie. The singing and dancing added to the film's educational value, too. Not only did I get to learn things I didn't know about Bobby Darin (like the fact that he adopted the name "Darin" and was really named Cassotto) but I also got to learn that Kevin Spacey is an excellent singer and dancer. In one of the extras on the DVD, Spacey points out that he started out his career in musicals and even auditioned for roles in many big name movie musicals. Again, I did not know anything about this so it was quite a shock when Spacey grabbed the microphone and started singing like a seasoned professional.<br /><br />Other performances in this movie are also notable, like Kate Bosworth and John Goodman. Bosworth plays Bobby Darin's wife- not an easy task when you consider the arrogant, volatile personality of Mr. Darin. She is emotional in the movie without taking it too far and she also shows her devotion to her husband in spite of his many personality flaws and his general neglect of his family. I also liked John Goodman in the role as Steve Blauner. Goodman is cool yet firm- exactly the type of person needed to handle the character of Bobby Darin and set him straight when necessary.<br /><br />Beyond the Sea has a great soundtrack- not just for the Bobby Darin songs but for other musical selections as well. One great surprise was the song "Let it Loose", a generally unknown song from the Rolling Stones (from the album Exile on Main Street). When I first heard this tune, I was pleasantly surprised and director/producer Kevin Spacey deserves credit for its inclusion. Its surreal sound and message fit in perfectly with the scene where it is played.<br /><br />Bobby Darin is a true rags to riches story that turns tragic in the end when Darin dies at the young age of 37. His life story is an interesting one, full of fast living, quick success, lofty goals, and personal turmoil. Keven Spacey's performance of Bobby Darin captures the arrogant, conceited personality of Darin quite well and Spacey's singing and dancing are nearly flawless. The movie overall could have been improved with a few slight changes but it is still a good film. Darin was several years before my time but I am still familiar with his music and much of it is showcased nicely in this biopic. Fans of Bobby Darin and his music will greatly enjoy this trip down memory lane.</p></body></html>

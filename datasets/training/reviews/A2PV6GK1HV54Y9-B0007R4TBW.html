Braff wrote and directed this film and his performance as a numb Hollywood actor is quite good but he isn't the one who messes up the acting, that honor goes to Portman. Her performance is so childlike and idiotic, you just want her to hide under a rock. The story isn't golden or groundbreaking, the film travels through too many dynamics, I don't even know how to catergorize this film, whiny drama or pathetic dark comedy. Stay clear from this "it's never too late to go back home" sometimes it is too damn late!</p></body></html>

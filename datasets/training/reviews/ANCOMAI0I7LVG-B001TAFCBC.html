<meta name="summary" content="One of the most original films in recent years, a truly mesmerizing accomplishment..."></head><body><p>Very rarely does a film come around that is so utterly flawless I have absolutely nothing negative to say in its behalf.  `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is that movie.  From start to finish, from its script to its cast to its brilliant direction, `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is fantastic, engaging, entertaining and most of all genuinely refreshing, unique and completely original and that is a facet of film that is very rarely attached to a motion picture.  All to often the same concept is revisited time and time again with different actors but the same story is being told, and while the underlining moral behind this film, of the haste in action and the reversal of consequence, I can't say has never been broached I can honestly say it's never been exploited with such sheer brilliance and most likely never will again.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Joel, played by Jim Carrey in his finest performance to date, a man who falls in love with a woman any man would be lucky to find.  Clementine is funny, spunky and sincere, nothing like anyone Joel or maybe even the movie going public has ever met and immediately he is absorbed and content in her light.  Everything is going perfect, going as expected.  They love, they fight, they live and they repeat.  They have a normal, healthy relationship until one day when Clementine doesn't remember Joel.  Joel soon finds that Clementine had a procedure done to erase him from her memory and so in haste he decides to do the same only to realize partway through the process that his best memories are of her.  He struggles to save her, hide her away in the corners of his mind and his fight is so remarkable and heartbreaking to watch.<br /><br />Director Michel Gondry is a masterclass of a director, and here he is so remarkably in tune with his characters and their surroundings that every scene jumps from the screen and into our skin.  Every scene, every prop is a perfect compliment to the actors and dialog and chemistry that just illuminates and oozes forth with utter satisfaction.  The cast is also at the top of their game.  As I mentioned Carrey himself gives us the best performance of his career breathing so much maturity coupled with adult naivety into Joel that he becomes the man we know or perhaps even are.  Winslet though is a revelation as Clementine giving one of if not the best individual performance of the past decade.  Her character is not an easy character to create let alone master yet she effortlessly becomes Clementine and thus we become enthralled in every scene she accompanies.  The mere fact that Kate Winslet is nothing more than `Oscar Nominated' infuriates me to no end, but that is for another discussion.<br /><br />The supporting cast of talented actors is flawless.  Kirsten Dunst is charming and fun and Mark Ruffalo is brilliant as always.  Even Elijah Wood, an actor I've never really felt owned it, surprised me and put in a great performance despite its lack of length.  Plus, any movie with the great Tom Wilkinson is worth its weight in gold, and the subplot involving his infidelitious doctor is a great asset to the film.<br /><br />`Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' dissects the most common of problems, human relationships, and does so with such grace and candor that the audience is involved and invested in every second of running time.  It beautifully captures the very real feelings of pain, abandonment and despair and the very childish ways that we as adults so often deal with those feelings and then of course the negative affect they have and our humane struggle to correct the problem before we're forced to live with it.  Charlie Kaufman's script is perfect, not a flaw in sight, and the casting of Winslet and Carrey in the leads was genius.  Neither of these actors, despite their rich resume, has ever accomplished what they have with this film as far as depth and richness of character.  `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' may have been snubbed the Oscar for Best Picture, heck, it wasn't even nominated, but it proved to me to be the best picture of that said year and maybe even of many years that precede and proceed.</p></body></html>

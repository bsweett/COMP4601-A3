<meta name="summary" content="A version of a biographical history of Elizabeth I"></head><body><p>Through out most of my lifetime Elizabeth II has reigned in England as a constitutional monarch. The first Elizabeth was another kind of monarch:<br />she was one of the last mostly beneficial absolute monarchs. The wrongs<br />of this system gave rise to a long period of civil strife after this period<br />in which royalists and protestants republicans fought it out.<br />She executed a number of Catholic conspirators in this film<br />as the result of a Papal ban on her father's Church of England.<br />In one view by defying the Spanish and the Pope, she established the British Empire in the world.<br />In another view she was the one who made more peace than war<br />and spent a lot of time building an army and navy for defense purposes.<br />Time has told and she was one of the greatest, best English absolute monarch and<br />makes the King George of the American Revolution look very bad?<br />The problem here is : do we believe this version of the biography or not?</p></body></html>

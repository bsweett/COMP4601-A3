<meta name="summary" content="Watch "From the Earth to the Moon" instead"></head><body><p>This is a long movie, and it certainly seems like it. Perhaps its Tom Hank's typically low-energy acting, or just that the movie doesn't recreate the suspense over 30 years after the incident, but I just find it heard to sit through this movie. At times, it starts to seem like the Tom Hanks show.<br /><br />If there is any redeeming factor to the movie, it's the fact that it later led to Tom Hank's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A0GYD2">From the Earth to the Moon</a> television series, which is excellent. That series focuses on the entire Apollo program and has a great set of actors [the series includes an episode on Apollo 13, but it also isn't very good]. I would actually give <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783225733">Apollo 13</a> an extra star just for leading to that series. On its own, the movie just isn't very satisfying.</p></body></html>

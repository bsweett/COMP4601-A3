And it isn't that the dialog barely resembles how human beings talk. (Sadly, it only occasionally breaks through to "it's so bad it's funny" terrain.) Taken as a whole, it's hard to imagine a worse superhero movie, and that's taking into account such dreck as The Fantastic Four (both versions) and Daredevil.<br /><br />I don't know what has happened to Nicolas Cage, by the way. I kept thinking of his hideous performance in the remake of The Wicker Man (as close to garbage as a film can get, never mind that it tainted the legacy of the wonderful original version). "Ow my legs!!" and "Not the bees!!!" I remember a time when he was actually pretty good (Moonstruck, maybe). He stinks. And even worse is the romantic interest -- the wooden and dopey Eva Mendez. She's one of those people who looks attractive (in a Raquel Welch with silicone kind of way) until she opens her mouth.<br /><br />I wish I hadn't contributed to the grotesquely huge opening weekend for this terrible mess.</p></body></html>

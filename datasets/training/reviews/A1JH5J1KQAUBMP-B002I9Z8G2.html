<meta name="summary" content="Best of a disappointing film series"></head><body><p>The crew of the Enterprise-E pursues a Borg ship back in time to foil their plan to change human history by preventing mankind's first contact with another species.  This adventure is the best of the generally underwhelming Next Generation films, with good solid action and a fast-moving plot.  Still, my general criticism of these films remains--they all feel like expanded episodes of the TV series.  I really wish they had taken the opportunity to take these characters into new territory like the Original Series films did.  Even if they split up the crew, I'm sure that a talented writer could have devised stories that would have required them to come back together every couple years or so.</p></body></html>

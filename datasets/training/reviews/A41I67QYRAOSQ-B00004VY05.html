The characters and acting are over the top.  Though its not a cartoon, it plays like cartoon characters. Its got romance.  Its got impending doom.  Its got ancient dudes.  Its got a futuristic society.  Its got space travel.  Its got a really bad villian.  Its got Chris Tucker as this WAY out there music star.  I guess its got a little of all the things that make a movie entertaining to watch over and over and over again.</p></body></html>

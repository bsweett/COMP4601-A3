Since Freddy is literally in hell and forgotten in the real world. Freddy has a plan to bring back Crystal Lake serial killer Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzinger) to life in the real world. Freddy thinks that by bringing Jason back to life to bring fear on Elm Street and making teenagers believe in Freddy again, he can break loose from hell and restart his killing spree.However, now that Jason is a instant killing machine, he isn't willing to step aside, and with a terrified town in the middle, Freddy has to find a way to kill Jason by going in his dreams before Jason takes over Elm Street. A scared teenager (Monica Keena) finds a way to bring Freddy to reality from her dreams, thus pitching Freddy and Jason into a horrific and bloody showdown.<br /><br />This film is directed by Ronny Yu (Bride with White Hair, Bride of Chucky, Formula 51) who made an entertaining Spin-Off to the "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and "Friday the 13th" Series. Robert Englund, who played Freddy Krueger for the 8th time, reprises his role as Freddy, and it seems that he had a blast making this film. Kirzinger replaced Kane Hodder (Hodder originally played Jason in the last four films) and adapts to his new role beautifully. Kirzinger is excellent as the new Jason. Sean S. Cunnigham, who produced and directed the original "Friday the 13th" is back producing this silly but larger than life epic. The film also stars Jason Ritter (Jason's father, the late John Ritter, worked with Yu in Bride of Chucky), Kelly Rowland (R & B singer from the group-Destiny's Child), Lochlyn Murno (Scary Movie), Chris Marquette (The Girl Next Door) and Katherine Isabelle (Ginger Snaps Trilogy).<br /><br />DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (also in Pan & Scan) and an superb-Dolby Digital 5.1 Expanded Surround Sound. DVD has an ingraining Commentary Track by the director and actors:Englund and Kirzinger. Disc Two has Deleted Scenes with/without Commentary, Many Behind the Scenes Featurettes, Music Video (Ill Nino- How Can I Live, which in my opinion is worth the price of the DVD), Hidden Features, DVD-ROM Content and more. The film has an strong music score by Greame Revell (The Crow, Dark City, Pitch Black) that pays tribute to the "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and "Friday the 13th". This film ended being a Box Office Smash for the studio New Line Cinema. Extremely entertaining for the Fans of both Freddy and Jason. Watch for New Line topper Robert Shaye (one of the executive producers of the film) as the Principal in a cameo appearance. Great gory fun all the way. (*****/*****).</p></body></html>

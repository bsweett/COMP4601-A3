There are some inovated kills in this, that will keep gore fans entertained. Plot? You already know it. Teens go into woods, smoke have sex, get slaughtered by a family of imbreed cannabals. Believe me that IS the plot. No character development, no suspense, no scares, but the gore is great. My personal favorites are the arrow in the eye and decaptitation of the girl in the tree. Other than that, this is going to put you sleep.</p></body></html>

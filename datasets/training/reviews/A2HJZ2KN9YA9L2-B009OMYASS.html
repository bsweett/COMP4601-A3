<meta name="summary" content="The antidote to Wolf Creek"></head><body><p>When watching this movie I got the distinct impression that Eli Roth, the director, knows and loves movies.  There are times early on when it seemed he was doing cinematic riffs on Hitchcock, at least before the extreme gore kicks in.  The choice of orchestrational music rather than rock or electronic helps to give the movie a rather sophisticated feel.<br /><br />I think I had all of the proper responses to this movie.  I winced.  I cringed.  I noticed how a character who talks about being a vegetarian at the beginning of the movie becomes a cold hearted killer by the end, and we cheer on this transformation, much as we cheer on a similar transformation in  Cronenberg's "A History of Violence."<br /><br />The heroes of this movie, like Eli Roth's previous film, Cabin Fever, are flawed.  They tend to objectiify women and are out to have a good time.  But they never come off as mean spirited.  When friends and aquantances disappear they actively search for them, become concerned when one of them isn't feeling well.  It is a creepy movie that stays with you and has some sembalnce of context.</p></body></html>

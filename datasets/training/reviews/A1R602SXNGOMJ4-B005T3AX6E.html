This is one of those wonderful films which is so unique and original that it sticks in your mind. The acting &amp; cast choices in this film was brilliant - John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Kietel, Uma Thurman, etc.. were notably exceptional. The multiple plots were fastpaced and fantastic in their detail and interest. The soundtrack is one you really need for your collection.  Movies like this one only come around every so often.  This is one that cannot be missed.</p></body></html>

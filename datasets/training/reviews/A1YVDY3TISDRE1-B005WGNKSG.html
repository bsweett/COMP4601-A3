In fact, there is a trilogy of books, and movies based on those books, of which this film is the first in a series of three.<br /><br />The plot involves an investigative journalist; he is hired by a man to investigate the death of a niece of his dating back decades ago.  There are possible clues that the person was killed by someone in her own family.<br /><br />Along the way the journalist finds help and assistance from an unlikely source and they develop a close bond.<br /><br />* this is the best thriller movie I have seen in years.  Can't wait to watch the other two movies in the series.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A powerful film.  Amazing views of the end of the war from the German point of view."></head><body><p>This is a superb movie that I helped me fill in a few questions I had about the end of World War II.  When I was young, the sensational media was still talking about finding Hitler, that is death was faked.  Sound familiar?  This movie takes inside the bunker in Berlin for the last few weeks of the war.  It is a reconstruction of various accounts from people who were there and left there testimony.  Several were still alive as late as 2000 and answered questions for the director.<br /><br />I had always wondered what the end of the war felt like to the Germans.  What actually went on there receiving all that bombardment?  Since this movie was made by Germans primarily for Germans, this is a fascinating perspective on that phase of the war and what went on in and around the bunker.  It is quite puzzling how in control of everything Hitler remained and yet how seemingly out of touch with what was really going on outside and not far away.  One answer could be that he was aware and simply refused to admit it in order to manipulate others to carry on the suicide / destruction of Germany - which he clearly wanted and ordered others (such as Albert Speer) to do.  Thankfully, those orders were largely disobeyed.  The destruction of the war made things hard enough without acts of self-sabotage.<br /><br />It was also interesting to see how all those around Hitler functioned and how Hitler manipulated and bullied them.  Their utter devotion to him and belief in him and the Reich bewilders me, but there it is.  I keep wondering why someone simply didn't take out a pistol and shoot him when it was clear everything was lost and it was apparent Hitler wanted to take everyone and everything with him to the grave.  But they didn't.  The seen of Magda Goebbels murdering her own six children with her husband standing just outside the door, when escape was still possible, is horrifying beyond description and made worse by its quiet bloodlessness.  However, this was the level of madness that possessed the true believers.<br /><br />The other issue is one that is still quite touchy.  Hitler is an icon of evil.  He, along with Stalin and Mao, were the great killers of the 20th century.  Hitler is the safest one to criticize, because his regime is thoroughly repudiated while the other two still have political connections with the present even if they are personally repudiated.  Still, in reality, they were people.  Monsters, yes, but still human beings of a certain, if horrible, kind.  In nearly all representations of Hitler and the Nazis in movies, television, books, magazines, or whatever, they are simply embodiments of evil and barely even caricatures of human beings.  This is a serious movie and it is interesting to see him put on the behavior of a human being when it suited him and when he let the monster rage.<br /><br />As interesting as the movie is, watch it a second time listening to the director's commentary.  While Oliver Hirschbeigel said that he is doing it without notes and simply reacting to what he is seeing on the screen, it is constantly fascinating.  He did a great deal of research for this film and knows a great deal of the history and shares it with us.  The few times he made things up, he tells us.  When he had to compromise the reality, he explains what it was and why.  He also discusses certain scenes and what he was going after.  The performances of the actors are also discussed and what they had to go through to make this film.  Most of those playing the key monsters understandably resisted the roles, but eventually took them on (obviously) and sometimes had personal issues with various scenes.  For example, the actress playing Magda Goebbels broke down during the filming of the scenes involving the murder of the six children (as does the audience watching).  However, on film she is as cold as can be.  In real life, the director tells us the reports have tears streaming from Magda's eyes as she plays the card game afterwards.  Here she is simply cold and dead as she lays out the cards.<br /><br />While all of the actors are superb, Bruno Ganz as Hitler has to be singled out for praise.  It was very courageous to take on this role.  And the way he not only gives voice to Hitler but the physical embodiment of his physical deterioration is overwhelming.  This is a performance that should be recognized and honored for its artistry and courage.<br /><br />The movie is in German with English subtitles.  Some of the subtitles move very quickly because of the amount of dialogue.  However, it is easy to pause the DVD and rewind if necessary.  Not all of the dialogue is essential to the understanding of the scenes.<br /><br />Please, do yourself and your sense of history a favor by seeing this powerful film and listening to the director's commentary about it.</p></body></html>

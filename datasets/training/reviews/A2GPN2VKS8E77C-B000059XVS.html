All-Star Cast & Exotic Locations."></head><body><p>When I first saw David Lean's "Desert Epic Masterpiece," I HATED the film, for reasons even I can't explain to myself now. I just saw this 3 hour, 46 minute movie again today, and...I LOVE it. The only way to see this movie (if not in theaters) is on the small screen...in WIDESCREEN, the way David Lean originally intended the film to be seen. And with panoramic views of the desert, Maurice Jarre's stirring score (notable for its being romantic, and yet there's no romance in the movie) and an all-star cast (including Alec Guinness, Jose Ferrer & Claude Raines), there is plenty to see and hear. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Peter O'Toole's bravura performance as T.E. Lawrence, in the role that made him a household name. O'Toole is simply handsome and completely reckless as Lawrence, as daring as the man himself, I dare say. He radiates charisma, fire and passion in every scene. Jose Ferrer is equally venomous in his cameo as Turkish Bey (he's the one who played Cyrano De Bergerac on film in 1954, and won an Academy Award for it). Omar Sharif (who would go on to greater fame as Doctor Zhivago several years later) is simply outstanding as Sherif Ali. Anthony Quayle is a firebrand as Auda Abu Tayli (please excuse me if I mis-spelled his character's name). Jack Hawkins is appropriately haughty as General Allenby (I'll always remember him as Quintus Arrius in William Wyler's epic "Ben-Hur"), Claude Raines is practical as Dryden, George Kennedy is loyal to the last as Colonel Harry Brighton and the rest of the cast and crew (especially costume designer Phyllis Dalton) did a remarkable and fantastic job on this movie. I highly recommend it. Rated PG.</p></body></html>

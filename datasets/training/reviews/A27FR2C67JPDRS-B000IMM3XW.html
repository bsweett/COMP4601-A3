When I saw that this movie was coming out, I thought I'd check it out and I'm glad I did.  The characters are really good and I especially liked Wolverine, Jean Grey and Storm (who I would like to see more of in the sequel).  With great actors like Patrick Stewart and the incredibly talented Ian McKellan it would have been hard for the director to go wrong.  The dvd has some cool extras and it is well worth the money.  If you like comic book heroes or not, this movie is worth your money.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Shrek the Third"></head><body><p>`Shrek the Third' is a rather lack lustre addition to the Shrek series of films and whilst perfectly enjoyable, it seems to be missing a key element.<br /><br />This follows Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots as they go to collect Finoa's cousin, Arthur, to install him as King after Fiona's father dies and Shrek doesn't want to become King or have the responsibility of the kingdom.  There is also the side story of Fiona's pregnancy and Shrek's hesitancy in ruling the kingdom is mirrored in his hesitancy in becoming a father.<br /><br />The characters are still voiced by the star cast we have come to love, as well as the addition of Justin Timberlake as Arthur.  The animation is also very good, as we have come to expect, and whilst other animated films have caught up to Shrek in their quality, this film still manages to do it very well indeed.<br /><br />The fairy tale `in jokes' are also prevalent and whilst they still raise a smile, they have mostly been exhausted and can't make you laugh throughout like the first two films did.  In fact this may be the key element that I mentioned is missing, originality.  This has all the components of a good animated film, but lacks any originality.<br /><br />All in all this is a perfectly enjoyable, animated film and should please fans of the previous films.  Just don't expect the style or verve of the first two films and you won't be disappointed.  Good but not great.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

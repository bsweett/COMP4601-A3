<meta name="summary" content="Alfred Hitchcock- Genius"></head><body><p>There are no words to describe how excellent this film is. Im 22 years old and this was my first time ever viewing this film. I saw the sequals before the original. Ive seen almost every other horror film out there and loved Pyscho 2. Wasnt that impressed with 3 but I eventually saw Pyscho and I am blown away. Any fan of psychological horror should see this. It is truly one of the greats and Hitchcock is an amazing director. This has to be in the top 3 best horror movies ever, if not the best. Story is about a young man named Norman Bates. He runs the Bates Motel. A woman named Marian Crane happens to run into him while trying to find a place to stay for the night after stealing 40,000 dollars. Wont tell you what happens from there but the film just keeps getting better and better till the great ending. Amazing performances by all. Anthony Perkins gives one of the most memorable performances in film history. Also contains a theatrical trailer with Hitch giving the audience a guided tour through the bates house/motel. Collector's Edition has The making of Pyscho original documentary, Interviews with Hitchcock's daughter and more.- Censored scenes, production drawings, unforgettable shower scene with and without music, news footage and production photographs. Highly Recomended. One of the greats! Enjoy.</p></body></html>

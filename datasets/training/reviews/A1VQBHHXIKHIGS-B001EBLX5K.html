<meta name="summary" content="I disagree that it's too vulgar"></head><body><p>I like the premise.  A lot.  Plus Borat has a presence to him, and his mangled grammar strongly reflects what I've encountered in my 9 years in Asia.<br /><br />Like my title says, I don't think it's too vulgar.  I'm not easily offended.  Rather, I found its humor too predictable.  It set up these great situations and then got a little lazy in writing its way through them.  It's an independent film which, unlike Hollywood pablum, doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence.  But in the end I just didn't laugh much.<br /><br />This is much better than anything out of the Crocodile Dundee franchise, just to pick one example of "foreigner in U S of the A" comedies of the "fish out of water" variety.  But I quit after 30 or 40 minutes because it was just somehow missing something.  I can't quite say what.  Deep thought?  Follow-through?  A supporting cast that should've remained unemployees wannabes flipping burgers?  I have no cultural learnings to make benefit for you here.<br /><br />I really don't believe this is a two-star movie, by the way.  It is too glorious for that.  I really wanted to give it 2.5, but that's not an option here.  Then I saw it was averaging 3.5, which strikes me as a bit high, so I was cruel just to bring that average down.  Go ahead and shoot me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Shyamalan outdoes himself"></head><body><p>Writer/director Night Shyamalan had a hard act to follow after his success with "The Sixth Sense", but he outdid himself with "Unbreakable", a film I liked even better.  This is an outstanding tale that incorporates fantasy, adventure, suspense, mystery, human interest and a complex character study of a man coming to terms with an unusual gift.  The story maintains its intriguing edge throughout, and just when the viewer thinks the last surprise has been revealed, another leaps forth.  The ending is fantastic, and will certainly surprise anyone who hasn't been tipped off.<p>The direction is superb in every aspect.  The photography is outstanding, with creative use of the camera that enhances the mystery and drama of the film.  Though some have complained about the pace of the film, I found it to be necessarily deliberate, avoiding the temptation to rush through the psychological elements and heightening the suspense.  The direction of the actors is also smartly done, with everyone working well together creating a realistic feel despite a story that flirts with fantasy themes.<p>Bruce Willis can't seem to do a film lately without a kid to play opposite.  As was the case with "Sixth Sense" and Haley Joel Osment, he works well with Spencer Treat Clark in this film.  The scene where Clark confronts him with a loaded weapon will nail you to the wall.  Willis plays the part just right with a combination of skepticism and curiosity that makes his transition from regular Joe to action hero extremely believable.<p>Samuel L. Jackson knows only one way to play a part and that is flat out.  Once again he delivers, with a darkly enigmatic character that makes the entire mystery work.  Jackson's talent and intensity again makes me wonder why he has only been nominated for one supporting Oscar ("Pulp Fiction").  Robin Wright Penn rounds out an excellent cast with a solid performance as Willis' wife.<p>For anyone who enjoys a good psychological thriller this film won't disappoint.  I rated it a 9/10.  It will keep you guessing and intrigued throughout.</p></body></html>

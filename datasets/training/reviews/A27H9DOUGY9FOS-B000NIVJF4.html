<meta name="summary" content="A Great Fictional Thriller Set In A Very Real Backdrop--"Last King" Is Relevant And Entertaining"></head><body><p>Before going any further, let's be upfront about what "The Last King of Scotland" is.  It is essentially a fictional thriller, with a political/historical backdrop.  With Forest Whitaker's highly touted performance as real-life Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, it may be natural to assume that the film is biographical in nature, but it is not.  While many of the events portrayed within the film are based on actual incidents, the primary story involving Amin's white Scottish doctor (James McAvoy who is the actual lead performance) is a complete work of fiction by "Scotland" novelist Giles Foden.  Interestingly enough, the original conception for this character was loosely based on the valet from Moliere's "Don Juan"--but he was promoted to a doctor, in this story, to generate more compelling ethical questions.  With that clarification in place, "The Last King of Scotland" is one heck of a ride--it is a riveting thriller that also manages to provide relevant insight into the complexity of Amin's private and public personas.<br /><br />The story framework and basic setup is not unfamiliar, we've seen it in many other genres--from political films, financial thrillers, corrupt cop stories, mob portraits, and even in supernatural hokum.  Basically, an ambitious young man is seduced by wealth and power.  Falling under the spell of an engaging mentor, he buys into the glorious lifestyle that he has always dreamed of--sacrificing a bit of himself, and making some moral compromises, in the process.  Ultimately, though, the situation gets out of hand, but it may be too late.  He is now complicit in the same crimes he wishes to extricate himself from.  In this case, McAvoy plays a Scottish medic who arrives in Uganda, on impulse, to "make a difference."  As Amin is rising to power, McAvoy gets caught up in public sentiment and a chance meeting brings doctor and dictator together.  Amin is fascinated by the young man's brash and bold nature, and the doctor is enthralled by Amin's power and charm.  Forming a strong initial bond, things soon start unraveling as Amin's real nature starts to become more clear.<br /><br />The power of "Last King" comes from the fact that this bond, this relationship, is actually quite believable.  You understand what would bring these two men together, and ultimately what would drive them apart.  Credit the screenplay for these interactions, but it's also the actors who breathe life into a great story.  Forest Whitaker, having won 1042 acting prizes for this role (OK, maybe not quite that many), is indeed phenomenal as Amin.  Expertly capturing both his charm and his dangerous paranoia, it is a spot-on recreation of a man who loved the limelight.  If you aren't familiar with the actual Amin, check out Barbet's Schroeder's documentary "General Idi Amin Dada" (available from Criterion) to see just how astute his portrait is.  McAvoy, who some find less convincing, is actually the dramatic center of the film, however.  It is his evolution from callow youth to coconspirator to victim that the film revolves around.  I, for one, thought he brought a lot to the role.  His casual indifference and moral ambiguity heighten this tale--it's not just a routine good versus evil story.<br /><br />Anyway, with great performances, realistic action sequences, and a tight script--I really enjoyed "Last King."  It was a thriller that I found to be genuinely thrilling, and the Ugandan backdrop is portrayed perfectly.  At times harrowing and brutal, this bit of fiction succeeds not only as rousing entertainment, but as a relevant historical portrait as well.  KGHarris, 02/07.</p></body></html>

His 'honest' straight-to-camera commentary depicted a man at odds with himself and what he called the human world; however, the irony that Treadwell died at the paws of those he was trying to 'protect' was not lost on the local National Park inhabitants, who felt that Treadwell was only dicing with death in getting so close to the grizzlies. Treadwell was obviously in love with himself more than his hairy friends; at times he worries more about his receding hair line than the bears themselves, and he feels no embarrassment in boasting that "I am a kind warrior" Director Herzog edits footage of Treadwell's documentaries with his own interviews to piece together a character of a man who tried all his life to be someone else.  Treadwell travelled around schools showing his footage to school children while never once soliciting a fee - and his skills as a documentary maker, as Treadwell's footage boasts coverage that studio directors with union crews wouldn't have got. Grizzly Man is a captivating and intriguing documentary, and a thought-provoking insight to one man's struggle - the shame is that the real struggle is with reality.</p></body></html>

As the featurettes explain, he dreamed of making a sword film, searched for a story, and finally wrote his own story that would allow him to express his excitement about the genre.<br /><br />So, the story is minimal - Nameless Hero (Jet Li) gradually approaches the King of the province Qin as he relates how he protected the King from potential assassins.  The film is done in flashbacks to show how Nameless Hero accomplished his feats.  In the end a plot is revealed that brings the movie to an odd resolution.  And that is really all the story is about.<br /><br />The beauty here is in the choices of various colors to depict the various stages of Nameless Hero's quest: oranges become yellows become reds become greens become whites, etc.  The settings are placed within the vast deserts of China and in palace courtyards. The costumes and settings are magically lush and stunningly beautiful.  The action is the expected highly choreographed martial arts sequences that appear more like ballet than fighting.  The huge supporting casts of armies are amazingly well staged with epic action and surreal results.<br /><br />The overall message is about the way the once divided China of 2000 years ago became united into what is called 'the Land'.  That is really all we have as far as directorial message mission.  It matters little that the acting is minimal and wooden, that the use of flashbacks and revised flashforwards leaves some mystery as to which of the characters have been killed on several occasions (!).  The pleasure is in the looking - and this is a beautiful, active piece of art to watch.<br /><br />Grady Harp</p></body></html>

It does stay true to the stories that preceeded it, but I agree with the previous review, this is sooo much gorier.  I've always had a funny feeling about roller coasters and airplanes, I really don't trust the aging mechanisms and the people that are supposed to be inspecting them, so this definitely played on those fears.  My pick for the goriest death?  The hardware store one.  The roller coaster was a great starter, but unlike the airplane in FD1, and the log truck in FD2, I was most shocked at the poor girls demise at the store in this one.</p></body></html>

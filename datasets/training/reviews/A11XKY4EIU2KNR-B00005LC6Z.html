<meta name="summary" content="A grand sequel"></head><body><p>This flick picks up the second the original Halloween left off. Michael survuved the fall and simply walked away. The majority of this flick takes place in a hospital where there are some grisly killings indeed. Who can forget the boiling couple in the therapy hottub, or the nurse who ended up donating just a little too much blood? Tomboy Jamie Lee Curtis and the Doctor are back for the ride and we discover the family secrets that Laurie and Michael share. A great ending with Michael walking through flames will leave you waiting for part III, unfortunately you had to wait for part IV.</p></body></html>

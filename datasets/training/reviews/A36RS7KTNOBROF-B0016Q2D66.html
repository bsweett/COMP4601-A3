<meta name="summary" content="A film that stays with you"></head><body><p>I never thought I would like this film,about a married couple in the 1950's but for some reason it gets to you.This married couple's  living the American life,the nice house,2 kids,and a good job,but want more,and almost make there dream come true,but something happens that should have been a blessing.<br />The acting is fantastic.Kate Winslet and Dicaprio are 2 of the greatest working actors today.I would love to see them in a comedy next.<br />"Revolutionary Road" is a movie you still think about after its over.</p></body></html>

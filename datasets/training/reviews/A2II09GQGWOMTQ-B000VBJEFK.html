<meta name="summary" content="A rat that cooks???"></head><body><p>I had reservations about Pixar's ability to pull this one off.<br />All of Pixar's movies have had non human stars in them.<br />I approached this film with an open mind and I came away absolutely stunned at how good it was.<br />Another Pixar triumph!!!<br />The acting, script, animation, EVERYTHING is just so perfect.<br />Is Pixar run by some alien force that just "KNOWS" how to make the perfect movie???<br />Pixar has yet to make one dud of a movie.<br />Well.........I really didn't care for A Bugs Life that much. But that was just my taste.<br />Am I the only one or did Ratatouille make you hungry for Italian food too???<br />Another masterpiece from the company that can do (almost) no wrong.<br />Recommended!!!</p></body></html>

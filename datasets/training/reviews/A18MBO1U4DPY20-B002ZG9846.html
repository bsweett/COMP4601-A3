It had some slapstick humor but the characters of the super hero were all very good except red-mist who really wasn't a super hero but just a phony wanna be. Towards the end, the film makes you want it to end. Great first half, Nicholas Cage kind of redeemed himself but he really is a bigger actor than all these films he's done recently. What happened to the man who made Leaving Las Vegas? I understand there's an age for everything but I'm happy he's bouncing back and this is definitely a step in the positive direction for him. My favourite thing about the film was the little girl with the cool purple hair, her attitude was amazing. She reminded me of the little sister to the main character in 500 days of summer. The stand-out feature is that the film is not one percent cheesy surprisingly. It is not very very funny unless you found Superbad the funniest film of all time. Slightly geeky and indie but overall a little over-rated. Definitely worth watching, exceeded my expectations but still, I'm not watching the correct films this year.</p></body></html>

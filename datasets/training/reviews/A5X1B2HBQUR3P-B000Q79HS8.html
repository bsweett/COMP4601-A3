The director shoots the movie like you are experiencing the events that Jason Bourne is experiencing. The whole movie has a real life edgy feel to it due to the fact that no steadycam was used so the camera keeps shaking and gives you this documentary real life feel to it. There are very few dolly shots in the movies, it all with handheld camera. The camera is placed in specific angles and hard to reach places like the inside of the car so that you feel a lot like being in Jason's seat. The extras feature have quite a bit on how they shot the chase scene, the fight moves and the special car rig that they built to get the shots. The car chase scene is one of the greatest chases captured on film. It's hard and fast and ends with full impact. The movie does not follow the book. Ludlum's novels Bourne - Identity, Supremacy and Ultimatum document his life as he grows old in fact in Ultimatum if I am not mistaken he is a senior citizen with kids and grand kids. The movie version takes book 1 and expands on it and uses the Bourne franchise name. I have no problem with that. The books as it were would not have worked in the medium of film. Good action flick. Watch Bourne always outsmart the CIA. Watch Bourne Ultimatum whih is an episodic continuation and end to this successful series.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></body></html>

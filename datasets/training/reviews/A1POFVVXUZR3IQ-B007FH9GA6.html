<meta name="summary" content="Credible and well-done adaptation"></head><body><p>As someone who has read and loved Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy and watched all the Swedish film adaptations of the novels, I was quite skeptical about the Hollywood treatment of the first book, fearing that it would take too many creative liberties and not stay faithful to the essence of the novel. Well, my fears were thankfully misplaced, as I love this film adaptation, rivaling the original Swedish remake (which I am a fan of).<br /><br />The casting for the Swedish film adaptation was excellent, and I think the Hollywood remake gets it right too. Daniel Craig plays the role of besieged journalist Mikael Blomqvist, who has just lost a libel suit filed against him by Hans Wennerstrom, a billionaire industrialist. Mikael has to pay a hefty sum of money to Wennerstrom, and to add to his woes, the publication he works for is also in financial trouble. Robin Wright plays his married lover and editor/ owner of the publication. Respite comes in the form of an offer from Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), scion of a wealthy family, and retired CEO of Vanger Corporation. Ensconced on the hauntingly beautiful yet desolate Hevestad (which I believe is fictional), Henrik wants Mikael to investigate what happened to his beloved niece Harriet, who mysteriously disappeared several decades ago. Tempted by hefty financial compensation, Mikael is further lured by the promise of confidential information that Henrik possesses, information that could potentially help Mikael against Wennerstrom. Soon, Mikael finds himself holed up on Hevestad in the dead of winter, investigating a cold case, and facing a cool reception from the other members of the Vanger clan, including Harriet's mother, uncle, etc. though he does get some encouragement from one of Harriet's cousins, Martin (Stellan Skarsgaard), who is now the CEO of the company.<br /><br />Rooney Mara plays Lisbeth Salander, a 23-year-old ward of the state, who has been deemed asocial and incompetent of making adult decisions. Her state-appointed guardian has recently suffered a severe health setback and is unable to perform his duties, so Lisbeth is assigned to a sadistic lawyer who uses his position of authority to sexually abuse her. Mara is credible in her portrayal of an obviously tormented soul who can hold her own and shows that her frail frame belies a steely determination which is at times tempered by emotional vulnerability as seen in her later interactions with Mikael (Lisbeth ends up assisting Mikael on the case).<br /><br />The movie is about 2 hours and 40 minutes in length, yet I never felt the story lagged at any point. Each scene is important, and the setting and sense of place is as integral to the film as the acting. The cinematography is breathtaking, especially of Hevestad in the depths of winter - cold, brutal, and unforgiving. The procedural aspect of the story, with Mikael and Lisbeth investigating the case together and alongside each other is well-paced, with suspense being gradually built up until the climax. The use of technology is vital in this film, and viewers get to see Lisbeth flex her investigative muscles as she hacks her way to crucial information.<br /><br />There are some very graphic scenes in this movie portraying violence in the form of rape, physical assault, and nudity. There are also some graphic images of crime scene photographs.<br /><br />I read the novel several years ago, and it has been a while since I watched the Swedish adaptation but I loved this latest adaptation, and can't wait to see how the filmmakers adapt the other two stories in the series, and am especially interested in how they show the evolution of Lisbeth Salander's character.</p></body></html>

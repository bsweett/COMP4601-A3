<meta name="summary" content="One of my favorite films of this year"></head><body><p>Last time director David Fincher did a film about a serial killer, he made what's right in my top 5 favorite films ever with Seven. But instead of revisiting the genre with the same approach, Zodiac takes on a different mood as well as a more serious approach. Whereas films like Panic Room and Fight Club had visual trickery and cameras going into flashbulb filaments, Zodiac is more restrained, more depth-filled and in the end better because of it. It's just too bad he's not as prolific since he hasn't made a single bad film ever and Zodiac is just another great entry into an impressive career.<br /><br />Taking place during the late 1960's and the bulk of the 70's, the film follows real-life San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith, fellow employee and friend Paul Avery and cops Dave Toschi and Bill Armstrong track down the mysterious and elusive Zodiac Killer, responsible for several murders. But Zodiac is different in that he actually writes letters to newspaper offices and leaves clues and strange symbols meant to be decoded. But trying to find out the identity, as well as determine the pattern is proving frustrating as Graysmith, Avery and Toschi find themselves more and more obsessed with figuring out who is the Zodiac.<br /><br />With Seven, we followed 2 detectives who were always one step behind the killer but in the game long enough to know and decipher the clues so it became more cat-and-mouse. Zodiac on the other hand is more procedural and that it's more about that frustration when things aren't happening quick enough and the answers are nowhere to be found, let alone can be figured out. One might not like the shift though since at a certain point we see less murder scenes and less Zodiac appearances and it becomes more about the obsession that takes over, particularly strong with Graysmith. But it's often been said that the mark of a great director is when he's given a bad script or premise and makes it a good movie. Fincher, who in my opinion hasn't even made a dud yet (and yes I'm including Alien3 with this) has already proven himself but here he takes the idea of a serial killer movie, one of the most formulaic genres there is next to horror and romantic comedies and makes it fascinating the entire way through.<br /><br />But a film is also in the hands of the actors and thankfully we have 3 great leads with all 3 of them being incredibly nuanced and strong in their performances. We also get cameos from John Carroll Lynch (the guy who get melted in Volcano, Frances McDormand's husband in Fargo) as Arthur Allen Leigh, Clea Duvall and Charles Fleischer, a.k.a the voice of Roger Rabbit, who has probably the creepiest scene in the entire film. One thing I should address as well is its length. No it's not near 3 hours since people exaggerate and assume many people don't hit the stop button when the credits roll. It's 2 and a half hours long but thanks to Fincher it never feels like it. But when it comes to long running times, there's 2 trains of thought: it's either too long for its own good and it's almost an indulgent length (the recent King Kong, the Holiday) and there's this film where it's long because it needs to be since there's so much story that needs telling.<br /><br />The DVD's (besides the Game which STILL doesn't have a region 1 special edition) from David Fincher have always been stellar from informative commentaries to behind the scenes footage. So the double dip that will happen is all the more disappointing. Did they not get things done in time? Make more money by making you buy the completely bare-bones edition and the special edition next year? You wish there was at least something on this but save your money unless you absolutely have to have this.<br /><br />Too bad it didn't make a huge dent at the box office but that's beside the point. Audiences know a good movie when they see it whether DVD or theatre and Zodiac is just as good a movie as people say it is and even a bit more.</p></body></html>

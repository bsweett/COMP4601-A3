Like the first Ocean movie, its set in Vegas and the plot such as it is, having only one setting to worry about means more time for the characters to interact, with each other, and also set in motion the revenge heist.<br /><br />Al Pacino is the big name added to the cast here, and I think it's his least intense performance for awhile. I got the impression he enjoyed not being the lead and had fun as Wily Banks, the villain of the piece - though in truth even the good guys are bad guys when you get down to it.<br /><br />As for the main gang, although Clooney, Pitt, Damon, Cheadle and Garcia are all good, the movie is actually stolen by Casey Affleck as Virgil. The little story he gets set in a Mexican factory not only is very funny, but nearly steals the movie. One of the things I've always admired about this series (and other big movie sagas), is the way they can get all the actors to return for each movie. For some movies, it could be due to being signed up for more as part of the deal, but here I think it's simply the fact they enjoy working together and it shows. The chemistry between them seems effortless, and also the fact that they like to poke fun at each other helps. Listen to the last exchange between Clooney and Pitt and you'll see what I mean!<br /><br />The actual plot about getting revenge when one of their numbers is cut out a big deal is not really that important. What's important is the fun you have simply getting to enjoy it being played out. It may not be up there with the first one, but as I mentioned, more than makes up for the disappointing sequel. If this is the end of the series, then it's a worthy finish.</p></body></html>

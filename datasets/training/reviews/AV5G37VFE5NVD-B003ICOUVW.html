If there's anything to be said in defense of "The Wolfman," it's that it's another movie with potential f****d over by the studio.  That's all the defense the film deserves.  It doesn't take a full moon to illuminate where the production went wrong.  Joe Johnston is a nice guy and a good director who shoots movies that look pretty--he knows how to use shadow, that's for sure--and fills them with characters no deeper than celluloid itself.  He's also studio-friendly: his films are well-received critically and profitable financially, which is why he won out as director in the end.  In hiring Johnston, Universal got a director they could feel safe with.  They also sabotaged the potential for a film with vision and, well, worth.<br /><br />The worthiest aspects of Johnston's "Wolfman," as it is, are two men: Hugo Weaving, who manages to give a Scotland Yard inspector as thin as the paper the script was printed on a fa?ade of life, and Rick Baker, who designed the makeup effects.  Anyone familiar with the Werewolf film will know Baker, whose epochal effects for John Landis' "An American Werewolf in London" won the first Best Makeup Effects Oscar in 1982.  His effects for "The Wolfman" were stunted by the studio like a plant without fertilizer or water.  Baker's work in "American Werewolf" is proof of the vast superiority of physical makeup effects to the modern-day computer-generated imagery, the latter being the method Universal forced him to use.  Nonsense.  The resulting effects generate more thrills than the other aspects of the film, but look hopelessly crude compared to the effects Baker designed--and executed, physically--almost thirty years ago.  All one can say about Weaving is that the liveliness he's able to wring from his talking clich&eacute; is nobility like the screen has rarely seen.<br /><br />Which directs attention to the script, that which attracted me to the project when it went in to development half a decade ago, since it's written by "Seven"'s Andrew Kevin Walker.  The script was touched up prior to filming by David Self, unfortunately, whom I think must to be blame for many of its shortcomings.  As translated to the screen, the script has flashes of almost exciting vision, flashes rapidly less frequent as the film progresses.  Most of the time, the plot takes leaps forward, trips on a sidestep, goes nowhere, and then leaves a hole so wide the monster from a far better monster movie, "Cloverfield," could crouch inside it.  The plot seems unsatisfactory in the middle of the film and obnoxious at its end.  Some scenes make no sense and suggest Self patchwork that would do David "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" Koepp proud.  Cliches are a pack of wolves roaming across the screenplay.  The cliches aren't as offensive as the scenes all-too-obviously stolen from Landis' "American Werewolf in London," and they certainly aren't so embarrassing as the painfully stupid werewolf fight I'd prayed the film was smart enough to avoid.  Could be the stupid/stolen action-injected scenes became a necessity once Danny Elfman delivered his score, supposedly a homage to Wojciech Kilar's score for Francis Ford Coppola's "Dracula," proof that Elfman has revealed himself as a long-since-spent theme-meister whose scores stink.<br /><br />As does this film, whether you see it as a rehash, a standalone picture, or, ugh, worst of all, the incumbent counterpart to Coppola's "Dracula"--now there was a remake.  Coppola's "Dracula" pulsed with sex, bizarrity, and, since those are two of its central components, life.  "The Wolfman" is nowhere near as bizarre as I'd like it--the weirdest it gets is some gore, which livens things up just enough to make me grateful the studio went with the R-rated version, and a trippy dream sequence that creeped me out enough for me to consider it successful--and it's about as sexy as a mossy old soda can in the middle of a marsh.  Which, with the soda can as completely unrounded character and the marsh providing opportunities for shadows and pretty visuals, might make fitting subject matter for Joe Johnston's next project.  Just leave "Frankenstein" alone.</p></body></html>

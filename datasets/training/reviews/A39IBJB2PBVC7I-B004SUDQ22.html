<meta name="summary" content="In A World Of Uncertainty, A Little Proof Is Welcome"></head><body><p>There's a wonderful moment late in Proof where Catherine, Gwyneth Paltrow, says sadly to Hal, Jake Gyllenhaal, "I think I'm like my father."  Hal, beaming, says, "You are."<br /><br />What is so marvelous about this exchange is that both statements are correct, but the interaction is a case study in flawed data interpretation.  Catherine means that she's afraid she is mad, like her father.  Indeed there is evidence enough that at the very least she is emotionally fragile and will succumb to serious mental illness at some point.  But Hal is looking right through her fears, he means that she is like her father in that she is a brilliant mathematician.  Ironically it is perhaps the latter of the two possibilities that causes Catherine greater fear.<br /><br />The other spellbinding moment is when she finally reads her father's great proof out loud to him, as he demands.  Without spoiling it I'll just say that this brief scene illustrates the essential truth of the movie so powerfully that it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Proof was originally a play, so the emphasis is on dialogue, beat, structure, nuance, and revelation.  Director Madden also gave us Shakespeare In Love, with Paltrow, so you know from the start you are in for a quality production.  Jake Gyllenhaal is faultless as a young man fearlessly going where a wiser man would not, because Paltrow's Catherine, while beguiling, is trouble.  This is perhaps the movie's greatest power, and Paltrow gives the best performance I've ever seen her give.<br /><br />Catherine is a woman of contradictions, strong yet brittle, selfless yet self-absorbed, generous yet resentful, brash yet timid.  She maintains this highly nuanced state throughout the film, and even though we cannot understand her, (as she cannot understand herself), frequently become impatient with her, wonder if she put herself in the role of victim in order to wallow in it and use it as a weapon against others, we never stop caring about her and hoping she'll be all right.<br /><br />This is a slightly different Paltrow, a little older, a little tougher, and her performance is incredibly confident - really a pleasure.  About Anthony Hopkins what can one say, he is such a fire horse that at this point he must carry around a handful of performances like this in his hip pocket at all times - that said, he is absolutely on target.<br /><br />The sleeper in this movie is Hope Davis as Claire, Catherine's sister.  She is Catherine's anti-matter, and their confrontations reveal much not just about them but also about their father.  With her "To-Do" lists, which she neatly checks off, her clipped speech, and precise thoughts about Catherine's future, Claire is the Uber-Yuppie from heck we all fear.  The irony is that once we get beyond our initial dread we see that she has some valid points.  Even the most elegant solution must be tested, Claire helps.  A rich and deeply satisfying film.</p></body></html>

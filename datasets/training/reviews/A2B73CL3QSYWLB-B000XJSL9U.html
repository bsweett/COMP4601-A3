<meta name="summary" content="McClane-Palin in 2008"></head><body><p>I miss the good old days of action flicks when they were helmed by great directors like McTiernan, Cameron, and Harlan and you had average Joes like Bruce, Arnold, and Sly saving the world.  Everything today is so CGI.  About the only actor today that meets the standards of yesteryear is Jason Statham.  The latest installment of "Die Hard" has it's cake and eats it too.  For sure there's alot of CGI but Willis makes you believe that he's getting his butt kicked by a Harrier.  The story combines post-911 paranoia, cyber-warfare, and old fashioned shoot-em-up in comvincing fashion.  The action in this flick never lets up.  In the center is Willis returning to the John McClane character like a favorite old shirt not unlike Harrison Ford in the recent Indiana Jones film.  So have your soda and popcorn or as McClane would have it a beer and hot dog and enjoy the fireworks.</p></body></html>

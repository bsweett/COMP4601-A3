<meta name="summary" content="The Sound of Music"></head><body><p>Maria Rainer (Julie Andrews), a candidate to become a nun at the Nonnberg Abbey in Austria, is a bit of a problem for the nuns. So to help her determine if she's truly ready to become a nun she's sent to be the governess for the stern Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) and his seven children, who've driven away all of their former governess's. Soon they warm up to Maria, though, as does the Captain, and together they change the way the von Trapp household is run.<br /><br />Based on the true story of the von Trapp Family Singers, The Sound of Music was the last musical written by Rodgers and Hammerstein as Oscar Hammerstein II died of cancer in 1960. Originally conceived as a Broadway musical that opened up in 1959, the rights changed hands several times before the film was eventually made. Since then The Sound of Music has become the third highest grossing movie of all time when it's grosses are adjusted for inflation (just behind Gone With the Wind and Star Wars respectively) and saved 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy after the flop of 1963's Cleopatra.<br /><br />Surprisingly, considering I'm not typically a big fan of musicals with a few exceptions, I actually have to say that I did enjoy The Sound of Music. Of course, this has less to do with the music than the fact that the characterizations are full and complete, allowing you to lose yourself in the characters and feel for their plights and passions. The plotting is also quite taut for a film that's almost three hours long, keeping you on the edge of your toes with the character's personal crises as well as with the outward crises that lands in Austria with the Nazis in the latter parts of the film.<br /><br />The acting is very well done, as that's what really gets you invested in the characters. At the time The Sound of Music went into production Julie Andrews was largely unknown as Mary Poppins hadn't been released, but she nails the part of the innocent and free spirited Maria. Christopher Plummer, who famously didn't enjoy working on the film (later referring to it as The Sound of Mucus) doesn't let on on screen his displeasure with the film, and still you feel the characters distaste for the Nazi regime and his love for Maria as well as his transformation from stern father figure to hands on patriarch.<br /><br />The biggest problem with The Sound of Music is that its a little too sweet, dripping with saccharine. This also means that some of the musical sequences can come off a bit to extremely cheesy, but even through that the film still feels genuine. And while I understand the need to make changes to a real life story in a film, every once in a while a filmmakers choices of change can be a little insulting to the subject of the film. The real Captain von Trapp, as stated by his children and his wife Maria, was not a stern man, and did not run his family like a military platoon as depicted in the film. Despite the pleadings of Maria and his children, the filmmakers decided to keep the characterization in the movie, which seems to me a little insulting to his memory.<br /><br />Overall, though, I do have to say that I enjoyed this movie. It gives an interesting depiction, especially towards the end of what Austrian citizens had to go through after the Nazi invasion. If you like musicals, or want to be transported to a more innocent time I highly recommend this movie. Just be careful after watching the movie or you could find yourself humming Rodgers and Hammerstein's songs for the next several weeks!<br /><br />4/5</p></body></html>

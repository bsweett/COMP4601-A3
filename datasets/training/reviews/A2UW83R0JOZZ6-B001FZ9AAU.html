Born from the imaginations of Stan Lee and Larry Lieber and penciled by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby in 1963, "Iron Man" is the second Marvel Comic hero come to life on the big screen this year.  Boasting big names (Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard) and even bigger visual effects to boot (courtesy of the illustrious Industrial Light and Magic), "Iron Man" was the box office grand slam of late spring 2008 and upon viewing it's easy to see why.<br /><br />The film doesn't waste much time before it jumps right into the action and gives us a keen character establishment of its main man.  Tony Stark (Downey Jr) is a man made rich off his father's munitions business of Stark Industries and lives rather recklessly as a result, cavorting about the world in private jets and expensive cars, bedding beautiful women and drinking at all hours of the day.  Beneath a seemingly spoiled rich boy exterior lies an astounding brain for engineering, Stark's company reaching new and glorious heights with his brilliant fabrications of innovative and powerful weapons for the US military.  When he travels to Afghanistan for a dramatic unveiling of his new "Jericho" missile, his small convoy is ambushed and he is taken prisoner by Afghan radicals.  Rigging his heart to a device that would mean certain death if he dismantled it, they order him to replicate the Jericho missile for their own purposes in exchange for his release.  Knowing he's a dead man no matter whether he accepts or refuses the terms, Tony sets to work on his greatest design yet, something that brings meaning to the saying "necessity is the mother of invention".  Breaking free from a desert cave in a colossal suit made of metal, Stark blasts the baddies and returns home to America with a renewed perspective, determined to veer off his long course of war profiteering.<br /><br />Something's afoot however and Stark encounters a curious amount of resistance to his plan from business partner Obadiah Stane (Bridges).  While the fragments of truth slowly piece together, Stark perfects his original design and with the help of his loyal assistant Pepper Potts (Paltrow) keeps the project hush-hush while testing its limitations and using its power to right the many wrongs that Stark Industries has caused.<br /><br />Being a comic book adaptation, you can expect some impressive visual effects from "Iron Man" and you get them in spades.  Not only do we see the streamlined red and gold suit in CGI but some of the fun parts are watching Stark piece it together in his vast workshop as well as test its radical capabilities (he gets comically blown into the wall more than once testing its rocket thrusters).  No greater magic can be felt than when a superhero takes flight and there are plenty of heartracing aerial stunts that have Iron Man soaring far and wide through the clouds and the stars, as well as taking treacherous falls from thousands of feet back to Earth.  The mere concept and engineering of the suit will get some mental gears turning, for in this age of rampant and advancing technology one can only wonder whether such a wondrous contraption is conceivable.<br /><br />Downey Jr. is the man of the hour as Tony Stark/Iron Man, the 43-year old actor relishing the extravagant playboy persona of his character and excelling in the dramatic scenes where Stark sees the cause and effect of his profession.  He also made a figurative iron man of himself, sculpting his body with vigorous weight training (five days a week) and martial arts.  He is a literal phoenix of the entertainment industry, risen from the ashes of drug abuse and bad press to come back full swing and win over audiences and jaded film critics once again.<br /><br />Also noteworthy is Bridges as the villanous Obadiah Stane, rendered almost unrecognizable with his bald head and full salt-and-pepper beard.  He takes to his bad guy role quite well and doesn't disappoint in his climactic battle with Stark.<br /><br />Paltrow, a critical darling and a great actress, is an odd choice for the role of Pepper Potts, her stiff performance going right along with her stiff traipsing in all those tight, restrictive skirts and stilettos she wears.  Her scenes with Downey Jr. where they are playfully bantering are engaging but when portraying terror, she falls flat.  Why she was chosen for this role is anyone's guess.  Another waste of talent is Terrence Howard as Rhodey, Stark's close friend and confidante.  Howard can act the hell out of a dramatic role (just watch "Crash" and "Hustle & Flow" and you'll see what I'm talking about) but nary a hint of his capabilities is revealed here, another headscratcher of a casting choice.<br /><br />Director Jon Favreau (an actor turned director) does an admirable job in the driver's seat with this big-budget feature ($140 million), recouping the cost and them some when the film made over $300 million domestically.  He has already signed on for a sequel, as have Downey Jr. and Paltrow.  It will be interesting to see whether he can be on par with or surpass Sam Raimi's "Spider-Man" juggernaut.<br /><br />Bottom line: Be you an action movie fan or a lover of superhero fables, "Iron Man" will entertain you in more ways than one with its non-stop action, engaging story and charismatic performance from Robert Downey Jr.</p></body></html>

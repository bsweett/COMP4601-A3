You don't even realize what an awesome film it is until you've all but finished watching it.<p>So many seemingly unconnected things  and people turn out to be connected in the strangest ways. The film is  reminiscent of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and Robert Altman's  &quot;Shortcuts,&quot; but it's even more subtle in how each character is  unknowingly connected to one another.  Makes you mentally take a  double-take with the whole &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot;  thing.<p>One incredible performance after another. Nearly every unpleasant  human experience happens in this film... racism, suicide, murder, incest,  drug abuse, murder, jealousy, death bed confessions and more... yet the  experiences bring the best out of these characters.  Some characters you  end up hating and others you end up liking in spite of yourself.<p>There is  nudity, one graphic (albeit extremely brief... about 1 second) sex scene  and about the worst language you have ever heard in film, so this is not  suitable for kids.  If you're into good film, deep thoughts and appreciate  the art of fine storytelling, this is a film you should see. Having it on  DVD is another plus as you can jump chapter to chapter after you have  watched the movie through the first time. After you see the whole film and  it finally all makes sense, you'll want to watch it again to catch all the  subtle clues and references (I can't tell you what references w/o spoiling  the film) through out.</p></body></html>

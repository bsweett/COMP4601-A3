<meta name="summary" content="The Happening - Another fine film by Night"></head><body><p>The Happening was a very fine film by Night Shyamalan and rates at least four stars with this reviewer. I never saw this movie until recently and am surprised at how poorly it did in the theaters and with many Amazon reviewers. The story was revealed with a clearly measured pace producing the feeling that the situation was going to get horribly worse very quickly. Can you imagine, this after a "possible" terrorist attack? I like Night's work (although disappointed by a couple of his films) and overall think he is a genius. I can't comment on this plot much more without ruining it, so please just see the film with an open mind.</p></body></html>

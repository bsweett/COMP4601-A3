<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Horror Films"></head><body><p>This scary movie is not your typical one, but its interesting and compelling all the same. Stephen King's horrific bestseller has not entirely been adapted to the screen, and some of the changes that director Stanley Kubrick makes are strange yet they work all the same. If you read the book, which in my opinion is about equal, then you may not agree. Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall give two glass-breaking, over the top performances but Danny Llyod and Scatman Crothers give two great performances here.<br /><br /> The film centers around a caretaker, who is watching over the spooky Overlook Hotel in the Rockies for the winter. But what he doesn't know is that the hotel is filled with ghosts, not pleasant ones either. Nicholson slowly begins to lose his mind [although it seems strangely quick on screentime] The ghosts are scary, yet not your traditional transparent things. The camera work, the editing, and just the feel of it all though is what makes this a modern horror classic.<br /><br /> My advice is to read the book first for better understanding of the story, but never fail to catch this movie alone at night. One thing it never lacks is thrills and spooks! By the way, don't ever watch the horrible 1997 remake, and don't get the titles confused either. This may not be entirely superior to the horror master's novel, but when compared to 98% of the other &lt;a style='text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 3px double;' href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=23&k=horror%20films" onmouseover="window.status='horror films'; return true;" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;">horror films&lt;/a>, this one is the King.</p></body></html>

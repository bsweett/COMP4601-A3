<meta name="summary" content="Very pleased with movie"></head><body><p>Excellent! I didn't think I'd like the adaptation of the famed creators of strange, and sometimes haunting, fairytales, but I was wrong. The movie was entertaining, humorous, and wonderfully done. There's enough horror to keep your eyes wide open and enough twists to keep the viewer guessing. The acting was superb. Highly recommended for anyone's home DVD library.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

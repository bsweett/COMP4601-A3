<meta name="summary" content="Decent sequel"></head><body><p>With a different villain in play (though Erik Lendsherr/Magneto is still a important character) this movie does a good job of continuing the story established in the first movie. Again, certain points of canon are ignored or changed, this is still a solid movie which does well with a movie telling of the story of X-Men.</p></body></html>

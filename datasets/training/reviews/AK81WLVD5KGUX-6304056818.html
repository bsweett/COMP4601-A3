<meta name="summary" content="A restored classic"></head><body><p>The DVD version of this classic film is a joy to watch. Fans of classic SF films probably already have it by now -- but if you don't, then get it at once.<p>The film features an extremely pre-_Naked Gun_ Leslie Nielsen as Captain J.J. Adams and the great Walter Pidgeon as Dr. Morbius in what amounts to a space-age recasting of _The Tempest_. Any viewer of the original _Star Trek_ will recognize both the plot and the production values: the Mad Scientist and his Beautiful Daughter are the sole survivors of a human mission to Altair 4, where everybody else has been killed by a strange, alien power into which the Mad Scientist has managed to tap . . .<p>This film pretty much set the standard for what starship crews were supposed to look like. It also featured the very first all-electronic score in motion picture history. And of course there's Robby, the robot who was so obviously the model for the one in _Lost in Space_.<p>Don't miss this one. It's not just your typical 1950s SF thriller; for its time, its special effects were on the cutting edge and its plot was fairly ambitious.</p></body></html>

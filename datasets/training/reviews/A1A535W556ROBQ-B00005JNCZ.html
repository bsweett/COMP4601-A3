What I liked most about the movie is that Salles steered clear of polemics, and thoughtfully invoked the life of Guevara, showing how this trip set the tone for the young doctor's life, moving him beyond the privileged neighborhoods of Buenos Aires and into the remote villages of a continent on the brink of revolution. The sad part is that Salles was able to recapture much the same sense of degredation in these villages, as so many of these places seem lost in time. The pivotal scene comes when Guevara and Granado visit a leper colony.  Gael Garcia Bernal turns in a beautifully understated performance in sharp contrast to the role he played in Y Tu Mama Tambien.</p></body></html>

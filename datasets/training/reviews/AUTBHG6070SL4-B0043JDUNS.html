The fast patter and winning wisecracks usually carry the movie when the comic-book effects don't - and there are some great effects. Paltrow's character, 'Pepper' Potts comes across with the right urgency and sincerity. Scarlett Johansson's spy babe fits that black catsuit flawlessly. Tony Stark's rival, Justin Hammer, creates a spoiled, whiny character with too much money for his own good - the kind you love to dislike, since he's not even evil enough to hate. And, of course, Mickey Rourke's 'Vanko' makes an electrifying badguy.<br /><br />Despite the great comic book styling, a few things fell flat. Comic book outsiders will scratch their heads over Nick Fury and SHIELD ("huh? where'd that come from?"). Everyone will scratch their heads over Potts's sudden promotion, once they see how Stark seems to undermine her (or try to) every time she tries to get the new job done. And, despite hints that he's not really as out of control as he seems, Stark being that out of control is just out of character - even RDJr's free-wheeling character.<br /><br />But, c'mon. You don't go to comic book movies for deep motivation or exploration of the human soul. You go for the BamPow goodness of a summer popcorn flick - and this offers plenty.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the relase to theaters<br /><br />(PS: The chemists out there already know that I really meant "Fe" in the title of this review - all others just take my word, it's no typo.)</p></body></html>

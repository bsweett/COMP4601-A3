<meta name="summary" content="freddy vs. jason: it's ok,but not the battle royal we wanted"></head><body><p>this is the long awaited battle between the two titans of 80's slasher horror.(long awaited by both franchise's in hopes of earning even more money from the two series)<br /><br />  well it seems freddy needs jason to help people remember his crimes so he can get out of hell and back to his killing ways. so freddy sends jason to springwood to kill and soon freddy is back to his old self. but darn it, jason won't leave and he's cramping freddy's style. soon the two are battleing it out and ,well , it's just not as much fun as it should be.<br /><br />  not bad , but just not as good as it should be so 3 stars.</p></body></html>

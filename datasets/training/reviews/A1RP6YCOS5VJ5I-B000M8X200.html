<meta name="summary" content="A Super Film!!"></head><body><p>Superman-The Movie is a one of a kind film that isn't hardly made anymore. The movie is a classic, it hasn't aged at all and it is never boring (no matter how many times I watch it). The cast is perfect for the story and the story itself is excellent. There is just a really great scene towards the end of the movie when Superman gets really angry. You can literally feel the rage coming off the screen.<br /><br />There are just so many special effects in this movie that are simply breath-taking, especially if you compare it to the films of the same year and decade. Just the ability to make Superman fly was an amazing stunt, but there are so many other things in the film that are equally cool. Some of my favorite scenes of the film are the helicopter scene, then there is the scene when Superman goes through the Earth's core and just the special effects used during Lex Luthor's test of Superman. It is just cool to see the bullets bounce off of the Man of Steel.<br /><br />Overall, this is just a beautiful film that is totally worth buying, especially with all of the extras this DVD has.</p></body></html>

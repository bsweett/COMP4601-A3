If you like "Captain America" -- and given its acting and production values, you probably will - it's because you've seen it all before somewhere else. You can tick off the standards: outcast superhero, Steve Rogers (who's basically the kid that gets sand kicked in his face in those comic book Charles Atlas ads), eccentric but well-meaning scientist with the German-Jewish accent (Albert Einstein, Hans Zarkhov, etc.), sadistic Nazi bastard (take your pick, Indiana Jones movies, The Phantom, The Rocketeer, The Marathon Man, etc.). It's full of romanticized 40s nostalgia, so much so that everyone, even the baddies, is apple-cheeked and there's no need to put minorities in it unless they accidentally walk by in the background. Captain America himself is Hitler's wet dream in the sense that our buff, blond and blue-eyed Olympian is essentially everything the Germans were after, the master race but on our side, by golly, and since Hitler's evil and we're not, it's all okay (and he's got that nifty, muted American flag costume to remind us). None of this is a problem necessarily, but to enjoy "Captain America," you have to be prepared for it. If not, you'll find it pure corn and not a little propagandistic, albeit with a slick retro quality that might make you want to believe the world was ever actually like this. If your politics run toward accusing Hollywood of liberalism, you'll find this movie difficult to fit into that viewpoint.  There's not much to say about the plot.  There's an evil Nazi running around with his own agenda and a wholesome hero who must stop him.  That's about it.  The rest is a well-photographed exercise in flag waving. Chris Evans, who looks like a less creepy version of Ryan Gosling, is fine in the limited role, and his female handler, played by Hayley Atwell, is basically today's version of Emma Peel. Stanley Tucci, Hugo Weaving, and Tommy Lee Jones are quite competent. The film reminded me of Disney's "The Rocketeer," which wasn't surprising given that both were directed by Joe Johnston, who gives the whole thing a Steven Spielberg gloss when he was in his prime. Though I had to fight to stay awake in parts and was a little distracted, I'm not sure that was entirely the movie's fault, but I will say watching it was the equivalent of eating a Big Mac on a full stomach.</p></body></html>

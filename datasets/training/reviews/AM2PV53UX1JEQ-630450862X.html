<meta name="summary" content="HAUNTING CLASSIC"></head><body><p>CARRIE shocked the living hell out of me when I was 17 years old. I could not get it out of my mind for years -- and have seen it at least 25 times since then.  It does have perhaps the most copied (and effective)  movie-horror-ending of all time, but it is the haunting performance of  Sissy Spacek that gets under your skin.  It is a spectacularly moving film,  even more unsettling because it is filled with sly wit and comedy.  Yet, as  in TITANIC, you know something really BAD is going to happen.  By the way,  William Katt resembles a young Redford here, and, along with the other  young luminaries, delivers a knockout performance. Donaggio's score is  chillingly effective, especially in the Carrie-Tommy dance, featuring  DePalma's trademark dizzying camera. It makes sense to me in some twisted  way that Michael Gore and Dean Pitchford (FAME) could visualize and hear a  musical in this story (B'way's CARRIE The Musical, 1988 -- w/Betty Buckley  as Mrs. White this time around, the original gym teacher in the film)-- the  sum of its parts is infinitely grander than one might expect in a  &quot;horror movie&quot;.  MUCH better than King's novel, which has its own  macabre voice. You will fall in love with Carrie too.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A worthy Remake"></head><body><p>Some people are complaining that the Remake of The Longest Yard is not funny enough.  But if you're familiar with the original, you know that while there was a lot of comedy, there was also an ample amount of drama as well.  In a refreshing change in a remake, Director Peter Segal who also directed Sandler in "50 First Dates" and "Anger Management" decided to stick to the spirit of the original film.  Too often directors of remakes try to put their own stamp on them and end up changing too much of the story, such as with the recent Dawn of the Dead remake.<br /><br />Segal basically runs the show scene for scene from the original with some cosmetic changing of characters.  Caretaker is now a black man (Chris Rock).  The role that Richard Kiel played as Sampson is now played by the behemoth black wrestler Bob Sapp as Switkoski.  The Role of the baddest cat in the joint which was Connie Shokner in the original, is now played by Giant Indian wrestler Dalip Singh as Turley.<br /><br />Other than these character changes, about the only other major change is that less time is devoted to Pau Crewes (Sandler) life in the joint and his interaction with the other prisoners.  The remake dispenses with that aspect and gets right into Crewe having to assemble a team of inmates to give the guards a tune-up game at the insistence of Warden Hazen (James Cromwell).<br /><br />Sandler probably isn't the athlete that Burt Reynolds was.  Reynolds did play college football afterall, but he pulled off his role as quarterback pretty well.  Rock is toned down a bit from his usual manic personality and Nick Turturro provides the comic relief and the butt of most of the jokes as Brucie.<br /><br />The film is loaded with personalities from wrestlers Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kevin Nash, and Bill Goldberg, to former NFL stars Michael Irvin and Bill Romanowski.  Throw in sports personalities Jim Rome and Chris Berman and you really have an all-star event.<br /><br />The actual football action was pretty well choreographed.  It's easy to spot who were the real athletes and who were the actors, though.  All in all this is a worthy remake that holds up well to the original.</p></body></html>

Much more realistic than a volcano turning L.A. into lava (VOLCANO) or a gung-ho uprising against evil aliens (INDEPENDECE DAY), the subject at the center of this 1996 sci-fi/disaster movie is one of the deadliest manifestations of nature--the tornado.<p>Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton portray scientists who, though they are on the edge of divorcing, are soonthrown back together when extremely violent storms form on the eastern fringe of the Rockies and soon sweep into the Midwest, an area known as "Tornado Alley."  Paxton looks upon it as a science, but Hunt is much more obsessive about it; she has been ever since a twister in June 1969 killed her father.  Caught up in this whole tornado business is Paxton's intended next wife (Jami Gertz).<p>Competing with a former partner (Cary Elwes) of theirs whom Paxton refers to as a "night crawler", Hunt and Paxton continually try to get their new tornado mapping device they call "Dorothy" (inspired by THE WIZARD OF OZ) into the heart of one of these dark and deadly storms.  They finally manage to do it with a monster twister measuring a mile wide at the base, but they nearly become casualties of that monster.<p>Despite the contrivances, TWISTER works because of the fine performances of Hunt and Paxton, who work good together even when they're bickering.  The film itself has a very kinetic, suspenseful, and downright frightening quality to it, thanks in large part to the direction of Jan DeBont (SPEED) and the realistic premise of the screenplay by Michael Crichton (JURASSIC PARK; WESTWORLD) and his wife Anne-Marie Martin.  The tornado effects, including the flying cow, the runaway debris, and the fuel tanker, are all quite hair-raising.<p>This is about as realistic a disaster film as there has been since the grand-daddy of all disaster films, Irwin Allen's 1974 epic THE TOWERING INFERNO.  It may not be an unflawed film, but it's definitely better than average.</p></body></html>

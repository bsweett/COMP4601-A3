A mob accountant is followed home by street scum, they hold him and his family hostage and the mob holds the sheriff's family hostage until they get their hands on evidence that could land them in prison. Now, the burnout negotiator must renew his skills and confidence to try to save his own family.<br /><br />Lots of action, I rate it a 5 star effort.</p></body></html>

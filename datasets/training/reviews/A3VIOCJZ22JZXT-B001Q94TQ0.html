<meta name="summary" content="A frightening day in the life of a drug mule"></head><body><p>Maria Full of Grace is a superb film. The story of how a young girl from the Columbian countryside becomes a drug "mule" for a drug cartel is realistic and frightening.  The acting of all the characters were great but Catalina Sandino Moreno playing the role of Maria was exceptional. Maria is a strong willed independent young woman, which in some ways leads her into extreme risk with drug dealers in Bogota. However her strong will also saves her in the end as she escapes from the web strung around her and other young women like her. The film draws you into her situation and is suspenseful throughout. I knew that people smuggled drugs into the US in their stomachs but this film gives you all the gory uncomfortable details. This was one of the best films of 2004!</p></body></html>

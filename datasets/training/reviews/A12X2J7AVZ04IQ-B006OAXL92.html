<meta name="summary" content="Magnificent film achievement"></head><body><p>I just had to get in my 5-stars.<br /><br />This film didn't win 5 Tech Oscars for no reason; Scorcese has crafted a very personal film; his devotion to film preservation is no secret to anyone.<br />The lovely story of Hugo Cabret is perfect subject matter for a man who finally decided to make a film his kids could watch. I never read the book, but the film, as presented, created a magical world. Indeed, the work of Melies may have gone forgotten.<br /><br />I'm sure many who are not serious film aficianados may not understand its importance, but the story being told should suffice. There are good characters, good script, fine acting and excellent direction, pulling all these elements together. Oscar-winning production values are reason enough to watch "Hugo", and Scorcese's loving homage may resonate with those who know the power of film.<br /><br />I've always had a particular affection for films seen through the eyes of kids; kids see so much more, and more simply...probably more like it is. The difference is that kids choose what is most important at the time, and Hugo makes good decisions.<br /><br />It's a marvelous family film. I liked it very much.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="More Of The Same, But It's Missing Something"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed the first two "Final Destination" flicks.  The original was exactly that--original.  Having Death go after those who cheated him was a very good idea.  The second film, bringing back Ali Larter and (in a minor role) Tony Todd, managed to keep my attention very well.  The kills were a bit more extravagant and the pacing was excellent.<br /><br />With "Final Destination 3," however, this rollercoaster has lost some steam.  Granted, the kills in this film were just as fun and intricately built as in the other two films, but it lacked characters that you could actually pull for.  Wendy, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, is the closest to an actual hero that the viewer would have any emotion for.<br /><br />The rest of the characters, played by remotely recognizable Ryan Merriman, Kris Lemche, a dude who's actually named Texas Battle, goth-girl wannabe Alexz Johnson (the "x" at the end of her name makes her cool) and a slew of other unknowns, do a decent job of standing around looking brooding, hot, athletic, or whatever else their stereotyped character is supposed to be.<br /><br />In case you're wondering about the plot, it's the same as the other two flicks.  Wendy has a premonition about a rollercoaster ride going insanely bad and her actions cause a few other people to miss the ride.  Death then goes after them, killing them off in the order they would have died on the coaster.  The rest of the story is spent showing us how gory and intricate the deaths can become.<br /><br />Something was missing here.  Perhaps it's just the fact that this is the third installment of the series and it's become boring.  Maybe it was the lack of a character you'd want to see actually survive to the end.  I don't know, but I have to say that despite the film's being boring, it moved at an excellent pace.  I was forty-five minutes into the film before I stopped to check how much time was left to the film.<br /><br />The DVD has quite a few nice extras, including the standard "making of" documentaries, an animated short, a look at teen thrillers, and a neat feature called "Choose Their Fate," which allows the viewer to pick one of two options to see either a different way of a character getting offed or, in a couple of cases, the characters actually survive.<br /><br />Overall, I'd consider this a good rental, but I would only buy it if I already own the other two flicks and needed it for a complete set.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very Realistic"></head><body><p>I guess we have all tendencies to compare this movie with the Shindler's list.This movie is certainly very close to the reality and as a matter of fact, it's really well done. I will mostly compare this to the movie serie named HOLOCAUST filmed in the 80's with Meryl Streep<br />You become easily like involved in the story.If you want to compare with the Shindler's list, I will say the Spielberg's work was more telling about the period, the fate of most of the jews. Polansky tells about the fate of just one character walking in what Spielberg described.<br />The pianist is someone who will have a lonely journey and it for sure makes the story,not less interesting, but flatter or quieter than the Shindler's list.Adrien Brody is simply excellent and it's an actor I'd like to see more often.<br />Last thing, please try to get and watch Night and Fog, it's a french 30 minutes documentary by Alain Resnais. In it, no actor but real pictures, real people and I can tell you, It will certainly be the more horrible thing you have ever seen on a screen making very weak everything you saw about the subject.</p></body></html>

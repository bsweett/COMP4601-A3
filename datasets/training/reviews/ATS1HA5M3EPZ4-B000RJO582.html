<meta name="summary" content="For those who aren't Horror film fans..."></head><body><p>I honestly have to say I am not a horror film fan.  I have never been fascinated (or even very scared) of most horror films with the exception of the very best ones like The Exorcist, The Texas Chainsaw Masacre or The Omen.  Mainly because most horror flicks are just slasher flicks, and if they attempt to be anything more, they are just kidding themselves.<br /><br />With that said, I must say I was very impressed with Zach Snyder's remake of Dawn of the Dead.  He obviously appreciated the original and did a remarkable job of staying faithful to the horror aspect.  The satirical aspects of Romero's version where people indulge themselves in a materialistic setting has been totally abandoned but certainly not missed.  This one goes more for action, suspense, horror and apparently in this unrated version, more character development.  I never saw the version in the theater so I cannot make the comparison, but I do believe the characters do get fleshed out (no pun intended) quite a bit, especially with Mekhi Phifer's character and his struggle on what to do with his pregnant wife, who may or may not be infected.<br /><br />The best part of this film is that it is an entertaining and well-written story before it is a horror flick.  But fear not (or fear a lot), the horror aspects are extremely creepy, especially in an early scene with Sarah Polley battling off the little girl from the neighborhood.  And as the movie goes on, the amount of gore does not try to make up for a lack of fright.  This is a great movie that happens to be a horror flick with a not so happy ending, especially if you keep watching through the credits.  The DVD extras are great, providing a lot of insight on how the effects were done and some low budget extra mini-movie/documentaries.  But strangely no theatrical trailer is included.</p></body></html>

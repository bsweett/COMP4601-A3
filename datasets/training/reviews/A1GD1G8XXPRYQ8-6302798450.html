It's funnier then the first two, plus it has more characters, more fighting scenes and cool re-made stuff, like the car that was made in a battle machine and so on. The whole movie is amazing. What made me sad is that there will be no 4th movie as far as i can tell and the movie is a little over an hour in length. This is it. A very sad thing. Bruce played really good in all the movies. And it's incredibly fun to watch the Army of Darkness. It's a really great classic movie, give it a watch!</p></body></html>

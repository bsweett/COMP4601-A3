<meta name="summary" content=""Ray" is OK"></head><body><p>"Ray" is what I would describe as a standard Hollywood version of a high budget biography film.  What makes this movie special is the subject; Ray Charles.  We get a somewhat complex picture of Ray Charles with interspersed flash backs to give us "deep background".  It was generally known that Mr. Charles had his weakness for drugs but I didn't realize how strong the addiction was.  The acting is very good but I had a real problem understanding much of the dialogue of Jimmie Foxx; the actor who plays Mr. Charles.  I don't recall Ray Charles as a mumbler although I don't know that I saw him all that much in interviews or talk shows.  However, if it was the was he spoke, there was no need to put that into the movie and leave many in the audience scratching their heads and wondering what he said.  For this he won the Best Actor Oscar?  What is the key to "Ray" is the music.  It was well presented and I was singing to myself for days after.  Enjoy the music and see if you can get subtitles.</p></body></html>

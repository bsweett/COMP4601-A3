I held off purchasing it as I was only ever a fan of the first one.  Admittingly, the first one was available separately (and still is) in Australia but has a hefty price tag.<br /><br />About two months ago, they re-released BTTF Parts 1,2,3 in Australia in a brand new beautiful 4 disc box set.  This time with all the same features as before, but with an additional disc with more extras for each film. The bottom line is the Aussie edition now matches the US edition.  The decision to buy has been a no brainer now, and works out cheaper than purchasing the first one.  I still just prefer the first film, but I practically get the other two for nothing.  THe additional disc of extras, is not bad at all.  Finally we get the Huey Lewis video for "Power of Love" even though they have put it against Part 2's features in error.  As we all know, this song is from the first part.  Also included is the special with Kirk cameron which is very enjoyable.<br /><br />So looking at the three films, I think may of us agree that Part 2 and 3 failed somewhat. It's always hard to beat an original.  Part 2 was a flop somewhat back at the cinemas in 1989.  I remember when we walked out of the cinema, there were not many good responses.  AS for Part 3, it was set in western times and if this kind of setting isn't your cup of tea, then it's not going to pull you in.  It also flopped at the movies.<br /><br />Sit back and watch the Part 1 (skip the others). It just gets better with every viewing.</p></body></html>

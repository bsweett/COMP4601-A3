<meta name="summary" content="When setting becomes character"></head><body><p>The milieu the characters of "Winter's Bone" inhabit is truly a world unto itself: a rural land where grinding poverty rules, where clannish ties run thick, where guns and hunting are an integral part of daily life, where acts of brutality and violence alternate with simple acts of charity and kindness, and where outsiders are viewed with suspicion and paranoia.<br /><br />In this richly atmospheric film of the Daniel Woodrell novel, Jennifer Lawrence plays Ree, a 17-year-old girl who lives in a dilapidated shack with her mentally ill mother and a younger brother and sister, whom Ree is essentially raising.  When the sheriff comes to inform her that her father, who's been arrested for crank production, has put up the family's home and land as bail, Ree goes in desperate search of him to ensure that he doesn't skip out on his court date.  However, as the young woman journeys through the area seeking information as to his whereabouts, she finds herself involved in a situation fraught with far more mystery and danger than she could have imagined when she first set out.  All this leads to Ree having to decide between strictly adhering to the "code of the hills" - in which the ties of blood trump all else - or of violating it and doing what is right for herself and her immediate family.<br /><br />Writer/director Debra Granik and co-writer Anne Rosellini immerse the audience so thoroughly in the Ozark setting that it takes us awhile to fully shake off the experience and to reorient ourselves to our own environment once the movie has ended.  It's a beautifully observed landscape of gnarled trees, car tires, chopped wood, rusted-out vehicles and hay bales, where the sounds of cattle lowing and coyotes howling compete with the twang of a banjo and country music songs playing mournfully on the radio.  Indeed, so cut off does this place seem from the outside world that many of the modern conveniences the rest of us take for granted - computers, cell phones, the internet - seem almost completely absent from the setting.<br /><br />In terms of storyline and drama, the filmmakers scrupulously avoid resorting to melodrama or clich&eacute;s to get their points across.  The events in the movie arise organically and naturally from the setting, and the understated performances add to the verisimilitude of the piece.  Lawrence carries the film with her insightful, dignified performance as Ree, a morally upright girl trying to do the right thing in a world almost totally devoid of resources and help.  Yet, it is Ree's determination to not give up and to try to make something decent out of her own life and the lives of her siblings that gives the film its overall tone of hope.<br /><br />Special note should also be taken of the stark, spare, haunting score by Dickon Hinchliffe that perfectly reflects the film's bleak and dreary background.<br /><br />"Winter's Bone" is a harsh, unsparing film, but a memorable, mesmerizing experience all the same.</p></body></html>

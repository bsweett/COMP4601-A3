<meta name="summary" content="Total lack of originality"></head><body><p>Richard Curtis really has completely run out of ideas. This was apparent in Love Actually which just rehashed all the most popular scenes from his earlier movies and this Bridget Jones sequel is just a reheated version of the first movie. The plotlines are the same - Bridget torn between reserved, uptight, underpant folding lawyer boyfriend Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) and raffish Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) who gets all the best lines and, as in the first movie, has far more sex appeal as a cocky, funny womaniser. Bridget obviously finds him irresistable but he keeps blowing his chances with her due his nymphomaniac sex life (in the first movie, his American fiancee got in the way, in this movie he is just about to close the deal when the Thai prostitute he ordered enters his hotel room, prompting the film's funniest line 'I'm up for it if you are' to the unimpressed Bridget). Apart from Hugh Grant the rest of the movie is just a padded out unrolling of the on off romance between Bridget and Mark. Even the actors come across uninspired by the script. Zellweger appears less kookily sparky than in the movie and Colin Firth looks as if he is bored and embarrased with his part (he has publicly admitted that he never wants to act in another Bridget Jones movie). Richard Curtis's material used to be original (when Four Weddings and a Funeral came out eleven years ago) but now his writing resembles a busker playing the same tired old tunes, keeping going only because the money keeps rolling in. Like all film genres, romantic comedies evolve. Curtis's conservative, trite, cliched offerings should make way for more creative, original productions.</p></body></html>

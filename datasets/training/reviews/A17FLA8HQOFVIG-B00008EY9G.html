<meta name="summary" content="Contrived ending ruins an interesting strory"></head><body><p>This 2003 film is a mystery as well as a horror film.  Ten strangers are stranded in a desolate motel on a stormy night.  One by one they are getting murdered.  It's a classic mystery as the guilt seems to fall on several characters.  There's also an interconnected story about a murderer whose psychiatrist is trying to get a last minute reprieve.  <p>John Cusack plays the part of a limousine driver who has once been a cop.  Ray Liotta plays a cop who's transporting a prisoner.  There's also a newly married couple who argue a lot, a prostitute who's giving up her way of life and another woman who's been injured in a accident as well as her husband and young son who never speaks a word.  There's also a strange motel clerk with secrets of his own.<p>But this is not a usual &quot;whodunit&quot;.  No way.  The connection between the individuals in the motel is much stranger than that. And when this connection is finally revealed, I was annoyed.  To my humble tastes, it was too contrived as it wanders into the unknown realms of the human psyche.<p>Yes, it held my interest.  Yes, there was some good acting.  But I hated the ending and felt the writer had played a rotten trick on the audience.  That's why I can only give this film a lukewarm recommendation.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pass the popcorn!"></head><body><p>Charlie's Angels never pretends to be anything but what it is -- an extended music video montage of highly stylized scenes, sexiness and feminine butt-kicking fun. <p>People looking for serious acting, dialogue, or a plot that makes sense need not attend. <p>Enjoy it for what it is. A popcorn movie that doesn't suck.<p>BTW, the DVD is absolutely packed full of extras, despite only coming on one DVD. (That's because the movie is just 90 minutes, so they have plenty of room for extras on the clothing, special effects, the goofy director, the music videos, three deleted scenes, et al).</p></body></html>

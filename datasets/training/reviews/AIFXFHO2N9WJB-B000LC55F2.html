The man responsible for showing you this side of magic, is none other than director Christopher Nolan, who has become one of Hollywood's most successful director's in recent years, with his films ranging from the confusing, sleeper hit "Memento", to the detective thriller "Insomnia", to DC Comics' caped crusader in "Batman Begins", and has managed to intrigue audiences every step of the way.  This latest effort "The Prestige", starring Hugh Jackman (`X-Men' trilogy) and Christian Bale ("Batman Begins"), proves to be no exception.<br /><br />"The Prestige" tells the story of two rival magicians, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), who once upon a time had worked together to perform illusions, but after one fateful night tore these two friends apart, they are now the bitterest of enemies.  Desperately trying to learn each other's secrets, these two one-time friends will stop at nothing to defeat the other.  As their obsession grows more dangerous, sabotage and deceit become everyday affairs on their quest to be the greatest illusionist of their time.<br /><br />"The Prestige" is one of those movies where you can't miss a second or else you may find yourself completely confused as to what's going on in the film.  There are several major twists within the story, with many minor ones thrown in along the way that will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what will be coming at you next.  In some movies too many surprises or twists can bring about a movies eventual downfall.  For instance if there are too many twists that it appears the writers themselves lost track of where they were intending to go, and the movie suffers by becoming confusing and convoluted.  "The Prestige" avoids this pitfall, thanks to the excellent writing of director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan.  Together they have managed to successfully craft a thoroughly engaging revenge movie that is unique, in that there is no clear cut hero in the movie.  Along with the revenge arc of the story, there are huge amounts of detail shown as to what went on behind the scenes of many of these magic tricks in the old days, which was really interesting, and surprising in some instances as to how far all of these magicians would go just to create an illusion for an audience.  This exploration into the somewhat darker side of magic is so intriguing because it's a part of that world that you haven't seen before.  Of course, the secrets revealed in this movie, may not have been all that secret of late, and are probably not even close to being how the magicians of today would create the same illusion, but it was still interesting to watch and showed me things I didn't know about.<br /><br />Throughout this story the two lead characters, brilliantly portrayed by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale respectively, do so many underhanded things to one another that neither one is without a share in the blame for the destructive paths their lives have taken.  This makes the movie interesting to watch because you can't completely side with either character as the hero for the movie, which allows the audience to not choose sides and therefore see both sides to the movie more clearly.  The two main supporting characters are excellently played by Scarlett Johansson, whose character is hardly without her own moral shortcomings, and Michael Caine, who plays the one character that could probably be described as the moral center for the film.  The acting in this movie is truly excellent, and allows "The Prestige" to become another successful film for director Christopher Nolan.<br /><br />By now, you have no doubt concluded that I really enjoyed this movie, and therefore highly recommend people to watch it.  However, this is not a movie for everyone, as it is a much darker movie than even I anticipated.  So, if you're thinking that this is going to be a magical, special effects extravaganza, then you will be sorely disappointed.  But if you are looking for a very well-acted, dramatic, and intense movie-going experience, then "The Prestige" is definitely one movie to watch, and if you're like me you'll want to see it again once it's over.<br /><br />"The Prestige" is rated PG-13 for violence.</p></body></html>

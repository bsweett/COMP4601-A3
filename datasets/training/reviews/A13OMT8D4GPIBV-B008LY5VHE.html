The first was a made for TV movie, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063UR5">Duel (Collector's Edition)</a>, ad the other was the low budget, comedic Goldie Hawn true story <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028HBIE">The Sugarland Express</a>.  So you could understand why no one expected Jaws to be a hit.<br /><br />But it was, becoming the first movie to gross more than $100 million at the box office and firmly cementing Speilberg's place as a filmmaker.  Not only did he create an effective and terrifying tale.  He created a movie that still gives some goosebumps 30 years later.<br /><br />Still as refreshing as the day it was first shown, Jaws is a classic.  The DVD features a two hour making of feature and a few deleted scenes.  It also has a documentary and a few other fun things.  The big draw will be the 60 page Commemorative Booklet.  Full of Jaws facts from here to there.<br /><br />Definitely a must for all Spielberg and Jaws fans.</p></body></html>

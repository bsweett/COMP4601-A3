<meta name="summary" content="Exploding red Pumpkins at 24 fps"></head><body><p>During a time when John Woo has not released a good action flick in over a decade there is nothing strange about John Rambo making a return to form late 80s 90 minute "fill-everything-that-moves-full-of-hot-lead" ultra-violent action genre that we haven't seen in a long time.<br /><br />Here John Rambo turns up in the far east passing his time catching snakes for the local snake teasing shows (yes, this is for real) when a group of young American Christian missionaries ask him desperately to take them into war-torn Burma so that they can deliver aid to some local villagers. After a debate and warning them against it (especially without guns) Rambo takes them up the river into deep Burma territory and drops them off. The missionaries eventually fall victim to a very bloody genocide campaign that is one the film's most brutal sequences as even kids aren't spared from the sadistic attack. Rambo soon discovers that the missionaries have gone missing from their pastor who has arrived from America with some mercenaries to go look for them. Rambo is invited along because he was the last one to know where they went and feels a duty to get them back. The remainder of the film is a very bloody and traumatic search and rescue mission and lots of action from start to finish.<br /><br />If the question is "is this a good film?" The answer is "absolutely not", well not in any traditional sense that we know understand the word good, but then again do we watch Rambo as an Oscar contender? Exactly, of course we don't, so we change the question to "Is it a good action film?" Yes! Rambo delivers and even tries to throw in some brainwork in the mix, especially its overall political message, an interesting basic idea about trying to make a difference and appeals to the real world scenario of developing nations and the problem of genocide and child soldiers. Overall Rambo IV is squeezed in at the right place and the right time. It might not be the best Rambo and maybe Stallone leaves a little too much of the action to the mercs and not enough for himself, but it is a Rambo movie and that is what you came to see.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Marilyn, Tony, & Jack at their best!"></head><body><p>How could this film be less than hilarious!  The timeless comedic devices of cross-dressing, confusion, and sex make this comedy a classic!<br /><br />Marilyn is superb (although all the filming troubles are well known now, you cannot detect them in the final product), Tony Curtis is just great, but no one touches Jack Lemmon's portrayal of "Daphne."<br /><br />Laugh out loud funny!  I highly recommend it to everyone!</p></body></html>

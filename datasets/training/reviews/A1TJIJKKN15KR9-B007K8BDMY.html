<meta name="summary" content="Regardless of Intentions, Man and Animal Can Never Fully Trust One Another"></head><body><p>Werner Herzog takes a long, unflinching look at Timothy Treadwell, the aggressive conservationist who pitched a tent in the wilderness with grizzly bears for the better part of his life. Treadwell is a fascinating character, almost inhumanly naive and childish but also extremely knowledgable in the actions of wild animals and the demands of life in the wild. Ultimately he allows his passion to get in the way of good judgment, as he madly rails against new park regulations installing a hundred-yard cushion between man and bear just weeks before becoming grizzly food himself, but there are both positives and negatives to take away from the story. His interactions with wild foxes make for some charming, amazing asides, and the unique perspectives afforded by his lifestyle share an intimate peek into the tendencies and temperament of grizzlies at their least guarded. As a naturalist he's without many peers, but unfortunately he's equally unrivaled as a cautionary tale regarding the volatile, unpredictable disposition of the untamed.</p></body></html>

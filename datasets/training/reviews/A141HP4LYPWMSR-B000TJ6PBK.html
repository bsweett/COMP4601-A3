I mean who doesn't love just about everything John Cusack appears in? Add the imposing figure of Samuel L. Jackson in a somewhat adversarial role and a reportedly haunted room at the Dophin Hotel and you begin to anticipate a disturbing, heart pounding journey into the supernatural.<br /><br />Unfortunately The film doesn't deliver as anticipated. Yes the production values are superb, the acting stellar (Cusack is amazing) and the storyline well developed and interesting. The problem is simple, the film simply lacks in the "Fear Factor" category which is obviously the most important aspect of any movie within the horror genre. There was no perceived acceleration of heartbeat, no increase in perspiration and no shutting of the eyes or turning away from the screen at any time. More importantly, there was no lingering uneasiness afterwards that would cause one to uncharacteristically peak into the closet or leave a night light on. All the things one would expect from a truly frightening film are mysteriously absent. Bottom line; good film, but not scary.<br /><br />My Rating: -3 ? Stars-.</p></body></html>

The ambitions and greed of a cast of eccentric characters are focused like a laser beam on the title object and its up to Sam Spade to sort out both the players and their Machiavellian plots and to dispense justice.  Great dialogue and one tense confrontation after another make this a real winner.</p></body></html>

The director seemed to be facinated w/ slow motion gun scenes w/ casings hitting the floor and stupid hollywood humor w/ killing the "dead" Jay Leno & Burt Reynolds. Maybe instead of wasting tons of time in makeup w/ the "dead" ppl they should've spent more time on the plot. Luckily, it was only a rental</p></body></html>

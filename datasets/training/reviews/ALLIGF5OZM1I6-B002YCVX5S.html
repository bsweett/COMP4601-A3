Jackson and Harvey Keitel<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Quentin Tarantino<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Quentin Tarantino<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Action / Drama<br />Release Date: 21 August 2009<br /><br />Despite having the word `inglourious' (yes, I am aware it is miss-spelled; so is basterds) in its title; Quentin Tarantino's latest `artsy' bloodbath Inglourious Basterds, is anything but inglorious. Behind only Public Enemies, this would be my second pick for the best movie of 2009.<br /><br />I'm such a huge fan of Tarantino's work, that I even give much praise to the continuously bashed and ridiculed Jackie Brown. Being rumored to have the nerve to walk up and personally hand-deliver a copy of his first script Reservoir Dogs, to actor Harvey Keitel; Tarantino is truly one of a kind.<br /><br />Any book on screenwriting will tell you that dialogue is supposed to be lean and that more is less. Thank God for his audience, Quentin Tarantino pays no matter to this ridiculous rule of Hollywood's thumb. The man has orchestrated some of the longest, intense, comedic and character driven tangents of dialogue, the face of cinema has ever seen. There is no shortage of them in Inglourious Basterds.<br /><br />The film begins with one in fact, and it was one of my favorite moments. We meet a French man who lives on a farm with his daughters during World War II. He is visited by the notorious Nazi, Colonel Hanz Landa, played by Christoph Waltz. The two sit and have a chat over a smoke from a pipe and a glass of refreshing milk. Their conversation? The details as to whether or not the man is hiding Jews under the floorboards of his small cottage. I won't reveal as to whether or not he is, but let's just say that what happens next sets up the entire second and third acts.<br /><br />Not long after, we meet the `Basterds.' They are a group of Jewish and American soldiers "dropped into France, dressed as civilians." Their mission - "One thing, and one thing only... killin' Nazis."<br /><br />Their leader is Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and he's one tough cookie. He has a heinous scar across his throat; the origin of which is never revealed to us. He seeks no greater pleasure in life, than hunting down and brutally killing and then scalping Nazis.<br /><br />Don't get too excited by this though; the only real complaint for the film I have, is there was not enough time with the `Basterds' being `Basterds.' Others would agree with me, in that we would have liked to see a few more scenes of them being `inglourious', to the Nazis. Luckily, Tarantino is already working on a prequel.<br /><br />I won't even go into any further details of the plot, as it would be virtually impossible to do without revealing crucial spoilers. I will say that is wildly entertaining and out there; as is to be expected from the mind of Tarantino.<br /><br />It will no doubt trump the Academy Awards; taking home Oscars for best picture, best director, cinematography and best original screenplay. I'd be willing to bet a small fortune that the amazing performance of Christoph Waltz as the disturbed Colonel Hanz, has already justified the engraving of his name on the Oscar for best supporting actor. He was electrifying and flawless in every scene. Tarantino had been working on this script since the early 90s, and is rumored to have put it on the back burner because he couldn't find the right `Hanz.' I think it's safe to say, he made the right choice.<br /><br />I was not at all surprised to find Brad Pitt blowing me away, yet again. The guy has perfected his craft to a serene art-form and you root for him the entire time. His accent and the persona he has given this character were hilarious.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the appearance of Mike Myers in the film, I do have something to say about it. I'm not quite sure if it's a comment to him or not, but I mean no disrespect when I say: I can't take him seriously. He is just too funny. Much like Will Ferrell, regardless of how dramatic he is attempting to be - I am laughing.<br /><br />I'd further like to point out that Tarantino is well aware that this film is a work of fiction. Yes; there is no recording in history of the things that are partaken upon in this film. It's a movie. But we have seen countless `based on...', war films in the past. This is a new idea. A `what if' idea; and I can't think of anything more interesting then Tarantino's vision: what if LT Raine and the Basterds had whipped out Hitler and the Nazis?</p></body></html>

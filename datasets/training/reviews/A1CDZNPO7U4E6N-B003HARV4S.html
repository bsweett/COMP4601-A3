<meta name="summary" content="Good Movie!"></head><body><p>Frankly, I don't share as much enthusiasm as others, but all in all, I would say that this is a good movie. I can't imagine why so many people can't help but constantly compare this movie to "The Prestige" when with the exception of the magical theme they are nothing alike. First of all, the illusions that are done in this film are absolutely amazing, but yet they reveal nothing to the audience about how they were done. The magic tricks in "The Prestige" pale in comparison to the illusions you saw in this film. Secondly, the premises are totally different. Thirdly, the ending of "The Prestige" is still somewhat of an enigma to me. I guess it's just a matter of the way a person interprets things. I really like movies with endings that surprise you, or make you think about what you just saw, and this ending doesn't disappoint. For me, I think the ending (which I won't reveal) and the illusions are really what sold this film. Of course, Rufus Sewell, Jessica Biel, Paul Giamatti, and the always excellent Edward Norton are amazing as well. With that being said, I'm still not jumping up and down. Again, I think this movie was good...not AWESOME!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Is it really that bad?"></head><body><p>Well actually, I'd give it 4stars, but I think all these 1 star reviews are being a *little* harsh. I mean for a horror movie, this is pretty good. Its gruesome, fairly frightening, and has some actual character development. WOW!!! I mean I was pretty scared after having seen this film. I've never thought of the song "Jeepers Creepers" the same way again. :p<p>  Basic plot, a brother and sister are driving home on a country road and are being chased by a maniac in a beaten up truck. They then decide to follow the truck and see bodies being dumped into a drain pipe. And of course they go, and check it out, and well you'll just have to see the movie to know the rest.<p>  I thought the acting was convincing between the brother and sister, I felt sympathy for them, I didn't want them to die(and that's a good thing), they had great chemistry. Would I watch it again? I think so, the final image in the film really haunted me. <p>  I'm a horror movie maniac, and I thought for a horror movie, considering that most horror movies suck, this was above the normal standard. I give it a 4 out of 5 stars, primarily because of the characters stupidity. :p</p></body></html>

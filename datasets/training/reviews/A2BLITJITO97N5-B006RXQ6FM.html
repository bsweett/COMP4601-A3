<meta name="summary" content="Unsatisfying, poorly written"></head><body><p>A horribly wound-up nun hounds a priest out of her parish because she (wrongly) suspects that he may be a pedophile. I found this film very unsatisfying as a drama. For one thing, the movie gives absolutely no explanation for Meryl Streep's character's nastiness. We hear nothing about her background except that she was once married and that her husband died in the war. The movie never explains why she is so nasty.  This is a poorly written drama and I think I know the reason why there is such a gaping hole in the script. Hold on to your seats because a lot of people reading this will not like what I am about to say. I suspect that the writer didn't think that he had to take time to explain the nun's hatred because he believes that all homophobia is baseless and paranoid and that it is always without reason or explanation. In other words, no viewer has a right to demand an explanation for Meryl Streep's homophobia when homophobia, at least as far as the writer is concerned, can never have any explanation but visceral and irrational hatred. Well, I'm not buying that rationale for one second. This is supposed to be a drama. The characters are supposed to make sense. Their actions have to have some motivation. Their opinions have an internal logic to them. Characters don't suddenly arrive at strongly held viewpoints without reason or background. This isn't character development; it's one dimensional caricaturing. How could any man have ever proposed to such a nasty woman (he couldn't have. So, what happened to change her?). How could such a nasty woman ever have thought that she had a vocation to serve Jesus? And how could she have been accepted into the convent (after thorough examination by a strict and demanding order of nuns) and then be elected mother superior? Answer: she couldn't have always been so mean and venomous so WHAT HAPPENED? This is the failure of the movie. Those who hate nuns or who like their homophobes to be one dimensional bigots won't care about that failure. This movie will confirm their own deeply held prejudices - and free them from having to think and question or - to have doubts.</p></body></html>

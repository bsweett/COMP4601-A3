Eastwood has a way of allowing the audience to absorb the material, and, as mentioned in the extras, Paul Haggis' screenplay hadn't reached it's final draft before Eastwood decided  that the primitive screenplay as it was would be more effective. It was a good decision. Characters are complete, and in the hands of the letter-perfect cast, there is no question about who these people are, what they want nor where they've been. Various plot twists keep things interesting, and there's a softness, even in the fight scenes, that makes you adore these people. Hilary Swank, once again, was in an Oscar race with Annette Bening. She deserved both. Excellent film!</p></body></html>

The first film is more intense and scary than the last two films but they are a lot funnier (The scene in the second film with the laughing deer had me on the floor laughing). Bruce Campbell's one-liners are hilarious and the gory special effects are a delight to horror fans everywhere. A great series to put on DVD.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tragicomic, comic book Edward Hopper."></head><body><p>No matter how unmanagable, anti-social or hopeless a teenager is, it's always assumed that it's just a phase, that eventually you will take your proper place in society, get a job and home, begin relationships, have a family, generally contribute to your community and society, if only by paying tax.  this process should be increasingly likely is you are as pretty, intelligent, witty, self-assured and creative as Enid in 'Ghost World'.  but what if you don't?  what happens if you bypass or postpone the 'right' decisions?  You find yourself out of the loop, outgrown by friends, ignored by family, a lack of social identity resulting in lack of identity full stop.  You become a ghost, and 'Ghost World' is a film defined by absence and lack - of people not having what they want, with major decisions taken by others as if they didn't exist; when even your ideal better half is more of a waning shadow.  Some of the crucial scenes pivoting on Enid's life occur when she isn't even there.  in such a scenario, familiar reality, with its hierarchies and compartments and classification, stops looking familiar and real, becomes a ghost world of grotesques, empty dream landscapes, randomness, spectral impossibilities.  But you can disappear from and for everyone except yourself - Enid is afflicted with an infernal self-consciousness.<p>'Ghost World' is a very funny and smart film, the ultimate teen movie.  But because the reassuring resolutions and socialisations of the teen movie are dislocated, it is an incredibly sad, almost tragic film, a kind of downbeat accompaniment to 'Amelie', another heroine as ghostlike manipulator of others' lives, threatened with her own empty solitude.  <p>'Ghost World' is based on a celebrated graphic novel by Daniel Clowes, and this aesthetic is pushed (for the first time on film it seems to me) to powerful emotional effect.  As in a comic book, the characters are mostly one-dimensional, often caricatures, the film's look broad and flat - even Enid's front of calm, contemptuous self-assurance.  the emotion of the film, as in the classic Hollywood melodrama, is displaced onto the bright, almost day-glo colours; onto the wonderful clothes Enid wears (increasingly red, tactlessly suggesting the border between adolescence and adulthood she is reluctant to cross); onto the locales, especially Enid's and Seymour's rooms, beautiful pop culture attempts to reveal personalities ignored in the real world; onto the rich musical soundtrack, from Hindi rock'n'roll to classic, eerie country and blues; to Zwigoff's creeping, methodical camerawork.  For the patient viewer, the pay-off is devastating, in an accumulative, low-key way.  <p>this faith in popular culture (Enid's remarkable illustrated diary; graffiti; porn shops; jumble sales; old corporate logos etc.), the transient, quickly obsolescent, quickly rewritten or surpressed alternative history of America, of our own lives, the ghosts that won't stay buried, forms a merciful release from the current mind-numbing obfuscations of both high and low culture.  An Americana masterpiece.</p></body></html>

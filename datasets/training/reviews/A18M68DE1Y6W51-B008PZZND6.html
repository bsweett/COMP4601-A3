Having read Annie Proulx's short story from which the movie was taken first, I can testify to the movie's phenomenally accurate, delicate and moving translation into film.<br /><br />What angers me beyond belief is all the adolescent, giggly jokes we had to endure for how many weeks? On every late-night show, and even at the Oscars themselves, absolutely everybody had a "gay cowboy" joke. But that's not what this story is about at all. Not even close.<br /><br />The intense unbreakable bond between Jack and Ennis examines the very essence of being human. Meeting at age 19, each has already been weathered by unspeakably harsh conditions, both environtally and spiritually. Ennis barely speaks. Jack is guarded and wary. On a summer looking after sheep in a starkly remote area of Wyoming, they are the only two human beings on the planet. And a bond between them forms and grows into something neither wants, but neither can break.<br /><br />Gosh, yuck yuck, let's get Jay Leno to make some more jokes! Or maybe, just maybe, those who haven't seen this movie can put aside their preordained "opinions" and just watch it unfold.<br /><br />Incredible directing by Ang Lee, incredible writing, spectacular photography and acting (Heath Ledger is incredibly talented as Ennis, in what might be the role of his career, but all the actors are superb), and lush, gorgeous music are all part of the whole--Brokeback Mountain is a masterpiece.<br /><br />My one tiny criticism of the DVD itself is that the music seems to drown out the dialogue, some of which is so soft that it is impossible to hear without turning the volume way up. Believe me, this is a small criticism and not enough to turn anyone away from this incredible movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Last part of the Queen Elizabeth I trilogy"></head><body><p>Long anticipated part three of the Queeen Elizabeth trilogy is finally out there with beautiful Kate Blanchett in the lead role.  Film focuses on the time in British history when Spain, the most powerful country in Europe, attempts to invade Britain in the name of the Catholic faith.  The premise film makes is that Spanish are using Mary, Queen of Scotland, as a bait for Elizabeth to give Spain a reason for invasion.  Important favorite at that time of Elizabeth's reign is Sir Walter Raleigh, who ends up marrying her favorite lady-in-waiting Bess.  Film attempts to cover many aspects of that time: clash between catholic and protestant faith, conflict between liberty and inquisition, Elizabeth's internal struggle between her duty as a queen to her country and her own need for love and loyalty of the man. One constant about all films about this fascinating queen is that she was strong, wise and dedicated ot her service toher people.  Her sense of duty and leadership overrode principal requirement of the time - to marry another prince and create political alliance with another strong European royal powerhouse.  She has managed to deliver prosperity to England and help protestanism establish its roots there.  She has redefined history as a woman, ruler and a political figure of her time who was able to control church, her court and her royal subjects with her wit alone.  However, the full acting credit in this film should go to Samantha Morton in her role of Queen Mary.  Ms. Morton has delivered wonderful depiction of the queen who dies for her faith and her belief of what is righteous life and reign ought to be.</p></body></html>

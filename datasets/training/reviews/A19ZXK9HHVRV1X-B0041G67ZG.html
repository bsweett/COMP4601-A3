<meta name="summary" content="very bland thriller"></head><body><p>**1/2<br /><br />Considering the level of talent involved in its making (Sean Penn, Nicole Kidman and Catherine Keener in front of the camera and director Sydney Pollack behind), "The Interpreter" turns out to be a surprisingly dull and lackluster political thriller, one whose attempts at topicality can't make up for the film's extreme over length and tedious plotline.<br /><br />Kidman plays Sylvia, an interpreter working at the U.N., who accidentally overhears what sounds like death threats aimed at an African dictator who is scheduled to deliver a speech before the General Assembly in a few weeks.  Penn and Keener are investigators who begin to suspect that Sylvia may not be quiet the disinterested observer she portrays herself to be in regards to the case.<br /><br />There's nothing overtly wrong with "The Interpreter" except that it never manages to engage us very fully in either its storyline or its characters.  Everyone involved in the production - from writer to director to actor - seems to be just going through the motions here.  In the inevitable romantic scenes, Penn and Kidman generate zero charisma together, and Keener is essentially wasted in her role as Penn's unsmiling, cynical partner.<br /><br />On second thought, there is one aspect to "The Interpreter" that might, be deemed offensive by some - and that is the film's willingness to use sensitive topics like genocide and terrorism as mere window dressing for what is, when all is said and done, a pretty lightweight whodunit confection.</p></body></html>

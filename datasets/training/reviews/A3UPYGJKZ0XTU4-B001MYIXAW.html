<meta name="summary" content="The Quiet, Frigid Horror of Predation and Victimization in One Swedish Town."></head><body><p>"Let the Right One In" is among the most striking vampire films I've seen. It is less a horror film than a drama with a horrific premise that jumps out at the audience every once in while. The film was directed by Tomas Alfredson from a screenplay written by John Ajvide Lindqvist, author of the novel on which it is based. In a working class suburb of Stockholm in the early 1980s, a frail, bookish 12-year-old named Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is terrorized by bullies at his school, while a murderer who drains his victims' blood stalks the community. Oskar is miserable, without friends or any obvious self-esteem. One evening, he is approached by Eli (Lina Leandersson), a 12-year-old girl who recently moved into his building. Eli is as socially isolated as Oskar is, but she could be a dangerous friend to have.<br /><br />The violence that lies beneath the nearly silent, snow-covered exterior is the scary part. It's cold. The population seems affable but disaffected. The efforts of Eli's keeper (Per Ragnar) to procure blood for her are so mundane and matter-of-fact that their violence is all the more startling. Yet I almost pitied him his difficulties. Oskar's mounting anger threatens to explode. Eli is a haunting girl with dark hair and big, blue eyes, possessed of a calm resignation and no aversion to killing. The film achieves its creepiness through a measured pace, quiet setting, and a refusal to spell anything out for us. We're never certain what's going to happen or even what we want to happen. We come to understand Eli's predicament slowly. In the end, I wasn't sure what I thought of her, but Eli made a strong impression. In Swedish with optional subtitles.<br /><br />The DVD (Magnolia 2009): Bonus features include 4 deleted scenes, a Photo Gallery of 20 production stills, a Theatrical Poster Gallery of 5 posters, and a "Behind the Scenes" (7 1/2 min) featurette in which director Tomas Alfredson talks about the movie, casting, and characters.

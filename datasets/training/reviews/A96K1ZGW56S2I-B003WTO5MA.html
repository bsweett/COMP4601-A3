The film is very loosely based upon a real-story about the Lutz family and the DeFeo family.  The DeFeos were the original owners of the Amityville house and 28 days after moving in the father of the family went insane and killed his entire family.  Years later the Lutz family purchases the house and moves in.  Soon afterwards some really bizarre things start to happen: they start seeing ghosts, the wallpaper peels really funny, and the father, George (Ryan Reynolds) starts acting really strange.  As the 28th day of their move in draws near the coincidences between what happens with the Lutzs and the DeFeos becomes too much to ignore.<br /><br />THE AMITVILLE HORROR has some good acting from the entire cast.  The story builds up nicely and does a fairly decent job of characterization.  However, I really didn't like the movie that much.  It really isn't all that frightening and the things that are supposed to be frightening come off looking like expensive special effects gags.  There's also the whole bit about the house supposedly being built on an old Indian burial ground (I know the original came out before, but POLTERGEIST handles that much better) and the basement having been used as a sacrificial temple by a colonial-aged witch named J. Katchum--that made no sense at all to me in the movie.  I realize that this is either a remake or re-imagining of the original film, so the filmmakers were trying to walk the line between staying true to the spirit of the original, but make it fresh.  That would have been alright, but THE AMITYVILLE HORROR wasn't a movie worth remaking in the first place.<br /><br />When's all said and done the thing this version of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR will probably be best remembered for is that it was the last film that MGM released as an independent company (it was bought out by Sony and other studios during the promotion of the movie).  What a sad way for a great studio of the past to die out.  That is a true horror.</p></body></html>

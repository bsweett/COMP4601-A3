This movie is not about those guys.  These guys do listen to stories but for another reason altogether.  For in the French-occupied Germany, the brothers are interested in pretending to be heroes who defeat monsters, ghosts and witches to gain huge payments from the towns they are supposedly saving.  But the evils are merely their henchmen who arrived early to set the stage.<br /><br />But things get strange when the local French general (Jonathan Price) gets a hold of them and enlists them to put an end to some other stories.  The problem is that this time the stories may be real.  The brothers move through interesting sets, characters and plots as one would expect from a Terry Gilliam movie.  The story is interesting and the story they are investigating has elements of a number of classic Grimm tales.<br /><br />As one would expect from the talents behind this film, it is visually stunning.  The story is well paced and the acting really fits.  Jonathan Price is simply excellent and at the top of his form.  The extras are pretty typical and what you would expect but nothing too special.  All in all it was nowhere near the film I was expecting (that became obvious right at the start) but it still managed to grab me and keep me interested.  Check it out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A wonderful sequel, and a masterpiece in its own right!"></head><body><p>The second instalment in the Harry Potter movie franchise is an excellent movie in its own right - the story of Harry Potter and his battle against dark forces continue, and the story takes on a darker tinge as the evil that Harry Potter battles begins to develop into a thing of more substance.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe reprises his role as Harry Potter as do Rupert Grint [Ron Weasley] & Emma Watson [Hermione Granger] -all three do justice to their roles, and show some maturing in each respective role, esp Radcliffe. Richard Harris plays Dumbledore, sadly for the last time, as he died, and Dumbledore is played by Michael Gambon after this movie. Kenneth Branagh plays the role of Gilderoy Lockhart, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher with a convincing air of vanity, appearing airheaded most of the times, as should be.<br /><br />The effects are even better in this instalment than in the previous movie - the creatures especially Dobby the house elf,the Basilisk, and Aragog, the giant spider are true examples of great CGI effects.<br /><br />All in all, this is a worthy follow-up in the Harry Potter franchise, and a visual feast for the senses.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="FABULOUSLY SCARY, BUT THE END IS A BIT OVER THE TOP"></head><body><p>Carrie is admittedly a stylishly done (on what was apparently a slim budget) adaptation of the eponymous King novel. <p>Sissy Spacek turns in a very credible performance as the teenage Carrie White who has never had a good day at school, and the high school bullies who taunt her are amusing twits. This whole rigmarole of a kook's daughter reaching out to her paranormal capabilities is actually quite worth a watch if you are into this genre -- and no, it's not your blood dripping Living Dead type horror if that's what you were worried about. <p>But the denouement is a bit overboard. Amazon's reviews call it an "immemorable finale", but a harrowing high school holocaust (in split-screen, apparently mildly tongue in cheek) was frankly a bit uncalled for. By this point much of the film's wit and taste had quickly faded away anyway, so I guess it shouldn't have made much of a difference. <p>Worth a watch? Definitely, this is one of the better horror movies. A masterpiece? No, by any stretch of imagination.</p></body></html>

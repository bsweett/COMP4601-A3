What should have been compelling and visually stunning commentary on soul healing and  bonds strengthened across the veil ended up confused communication and a disempowering and dissatisfactory question of how the story resolved.  The film split between the story of Susie Salmon's family after her rape and murder, and Susie's reticent experience of moving on in the afterlife.  For the most part the scenes of her family's life after her death were solid, except for the places where Susie intervened and touched their lives.  There was definitely an emphasis on sentiment in those moments, forsaking continuity and smooth delivery of the story.  The scenes of Susie in the afterlife were pretty but light.  They did not move the plot as they should have, which for someone who hadn't read the book would make them completely pointless.<br /><br />The fact that they chose to keep the film PG13 when dealing with child rape is telling in and of itself.  Often the decision to reach a wider audience kills a film's deeper allure, and this one is a perfect example.  Indeed, child rape is hinted at, but the fact that many nongraphic, yet revealing details of Susie's murder, thus of Mr. Harvey, are left out, the significance of her story and experience are diminished.  In fact, I don't recall the word rape ever being used in the film. This is highly relevant info that shouldn't have been muted, and not naming it exactly what it was is an insult to what Susie endured.  That omission doesn't allow enough of a picture of what Mr. Harvey truly was.  Susie gets a glimpse of it in her discovery of his murder of other girls, but Susie's experience is handled so carefully that the impact of it becomes dulled.  Had the foil of Susie's observation of  her peers going through the luxury of puberty been sustained through the film as it was in the book,  the breakdown between events in her family's life after her death and Susie's experience in the afterlife would have been clearer in the film.  She wasn't just seeking the end of Mr. Harvey, she was seeking peace in the tragic loss of her own selfhood.  This message is thinly veiled alongside the references of her being 'Daddy's girl,' and her resistance to completely move over for her family's peace.<br /><br />Susan Sarandon was the stand out talent in this film.  Tucci's Mr. Harvey was impeccably cringeworthy.  In the end, the film was overall very well acted and even directed.  The final edit detracted from both of those accomplishments significantly.</p></body></html>

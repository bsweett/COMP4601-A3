<meta name="summary" content="i belive  it may be the best film i've ever seen"></head><body><p>imagine this buy the time you finish reading this sentence you will have forgotten why your even sitting at your computer.this is what Guy Pearce character is like all through this movie,he suffers from a type of memory loss due to a tragic accident.this memory defect only prevents him from remembering what happens now,everything before the accident he does remember.the movie involves him trying to find out who attacked him and killed his wife...i'm not givin nothin else up,oh i will tell you this the movie plays backwards,its hard to descibe but it relly draws you into the film making you fill part of the story as lost as the main character but picture this you suffer from this condition which only ables you to remember for a quick minute, a man calls you tells you the mans name who killed your  wife all you have to do is remember the information he is telling you case closed you are drasticly looking for a pencil to right down the killers name when all of the sudden the man on the phone is gone you keep saying...remember..remeber all the sudden your dog lets out a bark..as you turn to your dog you forget you had even spoken to someone on the phone much less someone who had told you the killers identity.frustraiting heh.The director Christopher Nolan is the greatest screenwriter in hollywood,now also on my top directors list.nothing irritates me more that this film was only nominated for two academy awards(screenwriter and editing)which should win hands down but what about best diretor or best film they would definately be my choice this year.anyway if you only watch one movie in your entire life watch this one</p></body></html>

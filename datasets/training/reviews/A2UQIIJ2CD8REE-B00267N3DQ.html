<meta name="summary" content="Ever and More Than Ever an Amazing Viewing Experience"></head><body><p>In 1937, Walt Disney changed cinema forever with a little animated film called, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs", the first feature length, hand-drawn cartoon. It's the classic Grimm Brothers fairytale of a beautiful young princess who escapes a murder plot by her jealous stepmother, the queen, and is taken in by seven kindly dwarfs who live in a forest cottage and spend their days mining for precious jewels. One fateful day, after the wicked queen has discovered through her magic mirror that Snow White is still alive, she uses her talent for witchcraft to create a cursed, poison apple, disguises herself as an old hag, and journeys out to finish Snow White once and for all. The only flaw in her plan is that true love's kiss can break the apple's spell.<br /><br />Simply put, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" is a masterpiece. This is in no way an exaggeration. It may take a look at this Blu-Ray release's vast bonus features for much of the modern audience to truly appreciate how and why this film is such a masterpiece, but it is nonetheless. Even though this was Disney's first animated feature and the style reflects it, the amount of love, sweat, and tears poured into its making give it a unique and  enchanting richness only Pinocchio and Bambi even come close to. Snow White transports you to another world as only a few films can do. It is an old European storybook come to life. All the character designs and hand painted settings are glorious and an amazing advancement for the time. The Queen is one of the greatest screen villains ever, ruthless in a frighteningly believable way. All the songs are unforgettable classics, and while some have mocked Snow White's high-pitched voice over the years, Adriana Caselotti was the perfect choice for the sweet and innocent lead role and always sounds much better when viewing the film than we remember between distant viewings. And to guys like me who LOVE animated girls, while it is hard to compete with the modern Disney girls like Ariel, Belle, and Kim Possible, Snow White is truly a classic beauty and still very gorgeous. I always remember her as my first cartoon crush, alongside my first non-cartoon crush, Dorothy in MGM's Wizard of Oz. Funnily enough, it was the success of this film that allowed Oz to get the green light. Snow White not only has influenced films and filmmakers to this day, it also paved the way for a variety of types of films we have all loved so much, especially by earning respect for the fantasy genre.<br /><br />This new Diamond Edition Blu-Ray/DVD release of Snow White comes to us just in time for the Halloween season, and it's one of those Disney features that is just perfect for it! Old witches and poison apples just scream Halloween! We get 3 discs in the set: A Blu-Ray which holds the feature and a few bonus features, second Blu-Ray disc that holds the bulk of the bonus features, and a third disc that is a standard DVD of the feature film. It's a wonderful package that Disney is doing with all their Blu releases now, it seems, and I wish other studios would follow suit. Those of us who love buying Blu greatly appreciate getting standard DVD copies too for our other TVs in the house that maybe aren't upgraded yet, or for travel or computer use. For some reason, most of us DVD collectors just continue to be resistant when it comes to those pesky (and wasteful) digital download discs; nothing there to collect, really. I'm glad we aren't plagued with one of those things here.<br /><br />The feature film just looks and sounds incredible here, like never before! Truly gorgeous on Blu-Ray. Even if you own the previous DVD release, it's worth upgrading just for that. The Bonus Features are wonderful too, and there are tons. The previous (Platinum Edition) release of Snow White did hold much of what we have here, but there's lots of new stuff too, especially the Hyperion Studios Tour feature that showcases most of the Bonuses on Disc 2. There's a wonderful audio commentary by film historian John Canemaker and Walt Disney himself via archival audio clips on Disc 1 and several art galleries on Disc 2(I love the character design ones and the live-action reference stuff; also love promotional galleries). Disc 1 also holds a new music video for "Someday My Prince Will Come" as sung by the Disney Channel's Tiffany Thornton (not one of my favorite, current Disney Channel stars, but she does a good job with the song), a delightful look at the opening sequence of the upcoming "The Princess and the Frog", and an amazing look at two deleted scenes that were once planned to be used for a Snow White sequel short cartoon! I really found that last thing intriguing, and it's too bad they don't go ahead with that project today making use of the existing animation! After all, it's been long enough I think that it wouldn't hurt the integrity of the original (I mean, it's not like writing some new sequel that is totally focused on modern sensibilities and pandering to a toddler audience). It'd be wonderful to go to a new Disney feature and see that lost Snow White short playing before it. Also on Disc One are some games that are surprisingly fun, and a special feature that allows you to insert yourself into clips from the film using BD Live. There's also a how-to for using Disneyphile copies (the digital copies, ugh), even though Snow White didn't come with one. Oh, and before I forget, Disc One is also equipped with the "Disney View" option, so if you have a widescreen TV, which Blu-Rays are basically made for, you can activate to have the black bars on the side of this properly fullscreen film replaced with artwork meant to blend in with the film's backgrounds. Frankly, I tried this and found it distracting. Beautiful artwork, but in some scenes it didn't look right to me, like the forest stuff.<br /><br />As for more of what Disc Two holds in the Hyperion Tour section and beyond, as I said, there are galleries, but there are also tons of audio clips and featurettes that really do an amazing job of taking you back to the days Snow White was being made. You really get a feeling you're exploring the old Hyperion Studios with Walt and the animation legends; or more often, sitting in a room with them and listening to them reminisce. The stories are fascinating. An important thing to note here is that the story of the making of Disney's Snow White is very much the story of the early development of Disney animation and animation as a film medium in general, and the Bonus Features on Disc 2 do an amazing job reflecting and focusing on that. This is all about the beginnings of Disney animation. It's in depth, touching (if you're a Disney fanatic like me and your childhood dream was to be one of these great animators), and so much fun to explore, though there is thankfully an Index for when you don't feel like getting to things the long way.<br /><br />There are many classic Disney shorts on Disc 2 as well, emphasizing the importance of Disney's previous works in leading up to the masterpiece at hand. The Old Mill, Playful Pluto, The Goddess of Spring, Flowers and Trees, Babes in the Woods, Musicland, Steamboat Willie, and The Skeleton Dance can all be found on Disc 2. And a final couple of bonus features ported over from the previous DVD release are the delightful retrospective "Disney Through the Ages" and the "Dopey's Wild Mine Ride" game. The game is pretty fun, and the retrospective is very fun. It also includes many Snow White theatrical trailers to break up each of the decades talked about, each hosted by a different "Disney" personality. I must admit that I was a little miffed that my disc kept skipping during the Fess Parker/1950's section though. One always hopes the newest technology will leap the hurdles of flaws like skipping. It seems Blu-Ray isn't the technology to leap that hurdle, and I was watching it on a PS3, which are darn good players. Unfortunately, it's not as simple as saying I can watch this featurette on my old DVD if I really want to, as this Blu-Ray features an updated version with new segments hosted by John Ratzenberger, including a new decade! Well, it's a good feature anyway and I envy those who get to watch it unflawed. Oh, and there is one more bonus feature: a Heigh Ho sing-along. I don't get much use out of those as bonus features though. Can't we just turn on the subtitles during the film?<br /><br />All in all, this new Blu-Ray release of Snow White is outstanding and definitely a must own, even if it's a double-dip for you. I won't say it's without flaws though (and I'm not just talking about my skipping Fess Parker segment). There was a nice chunk of wonderful bonus features that were not ported over from the previous release, and there is just no excuse for that. Every new, grandiose release of a film on home video should include all the bonus features of its predecessors. That should be understood. Okay, games and things of that nature I can understand leaving off, but not deleted scenes, alternate songs, live action reference footage, and so on... This just means the true fan must hang on to his or her older release too, and that doesn't do much to encourage double dipping. But, again I say, this release is well worth it. It's a must have. But DON'T toss out your old Platinum Edition if you care about bonus features. The Diamond Edition has great ones, but it lacks some too. Most importantly though, the film itself has never looked better and belongs on the shelf of every film aficionado and Disney fanatic.<br /><br />Also recommended for fans of Snow White: Pinocchio, Bambi, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Black Cauldron, and all other Disney animated films! And go see The Princess and the Frog in theaters! More recommendations: Fantasia, Enchanted, Disney's Silly Symphonies (and the Walt Disney Treasures Collections in general), Snow White: A Tale of Terror, and all the Cannon Movie Tales, but especially Snow White in this case. There's also a Hallmark Snow White TV movie, but I only recommend it if you are entertained enough just enjoying the beauty of Kristen Kreuk (as I am known to be at times). Also often recommended to me is the mini-series "The 10th Kingdom", though I've yet to see it, and I know Filmation made a Snow White Christmas Special and their own Snow White feature sequel. I can't comment on those. I recently acquired them (they are available in one DVD set with Journey Back to Oz) but haven't gotten around to viewing them.</p></body></html>

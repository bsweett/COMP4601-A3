<meta name="summary" content="Like &quot;First Contact&quot; consistentsy suffers!"></head><body><p>As a fan of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, I was glad to see this one work, After the last outing, the horrible &quot;Insurection&quot; I had little faith in this one, but that faith has been somewhat restored, like &quot;First Contact&quot; this one is loaded with action set pieces that fans have come to expect &amp; like &quot;First Contact&quot; it has succeeded where &quot;Insurection&quot; miserably failed!!!, but there are some inconsistent details, the series that ran from 1987 to 1994 were great, the last &amp; final episode &quot;All good things&quot; was a great way to end the series &amp; pick up with &quot;Generations&quot; the first feature film, which was also good, the last episode had Picard jumping from past, present, &amp; future, in the future scenes, appearnaces had not changed much, costumes &amp; ship designs were more advanced but had the same color elements to them, with &quot;First Contact&quot; &amp; &quot;Nemesis&quot; ship &amp; costume designs are somewhat different, In &quot;Nemesis&quot; the Enterprise E is sent to Romulas where Picard &amp; the crew discover a sinister plot by a villian that is an evil clone of Picard's younger self, who has a starship more superior than any ship in Starfleet, it seems he needs Picard's blood to live &amp; tries to sway Picard to his side, in an effort to rule the Romulan Empire &amp; seize control of Earth, when Picard refuses to help him, a battle ensues, a battle very similar to &quot;Wrath of Kahn&quot; where the two try to out manuever one another with many action set pieces, Data's death/sacrifice scene is emotional at best &amp; well done for the most part, but this is where consistency gets lost, it totally contradicts the last episode of the series where Data is still around in Picard's future, not unless it was a perception of the future to Picard, fans can only have their view on this detail, one neat element is Riker &amp; Troi finally marrying after ignoring each other's feeling through out the series, you always knew it would happen &amp; now it does &amp; Riker finally taking his own command, finally!!, somthing that he was always reluctant to do in the series, &quot;Nemesis&quot; does grow its characters very well, but Rick Berman like most producers fails in the consistentsy department, this is why George Lucas sought control over his &quot;Star Wars&quot; frnachise, because of people like Berman, &amp; their failure to keep consistent with past events, but that should not stop one's enjoyment of &quot;Nemesis&quot; or &quot;First Contact&quot; for that matter once you get past those issues!!!</p></body></html>

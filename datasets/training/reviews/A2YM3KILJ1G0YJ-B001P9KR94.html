I'm sure I'd win it all.  It never happens, of course, and there ends up being questions about Zoroastrianism, famous European architecture, or Finnish lakes.  For one Indian slumdog, however, the stars align.<br /><br />A young man, Jamal, is a contestant on the Indian version of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire", and he's quickly turning into an improbable Ken Jennings-like participant with a nation of cheering .  He simply cannot lose, and none of the game-show or police officials, who torture him, believe he's doing it legitimately; they're willing to beat him in order to prove that he's cheating.  Time and time again, however, Jamal unfolds exhilarating tales of how he has answered the seemingly impossible questions, and proves through flashbacks that his difficult, poverty-stricken life filled with the pressure of both the impossible rags-to-riches life of urban Mumbai, India, but also a criminal element constantly grasping at his shoestrings, has provided him with a lot more knowledge than anyone could believe.<br /><br />Together with his brother Salim - who drifts towards the criminal element rather than living a more difficult ethical life - and the only woman he has ever loved, Latika, the three form as children their own version of the Three Musketeers.  When hardship causes them to separate multiple times in life, it's love that eventually brings Jamal back to his brother, and eventually Latika.  When he improbably ends up on the game-show, he realizes it is his best, and possibly last, chance at a dream life with Latika.<br /><br />Very rarely does a highly touted film actually deserve the praise Hollywood bestows upon it.  In the case of Slumdog Millionaire, I'd say that for a welcome change, the praise is warranted.  The story itself is enthralling; there is intense drama, excellent acting, and a total package that brings about heartbreaking emotion.  Comparable to several movies, I'd say this most closely resembles an Indian Romeo and Juliet, but with a less tragic ending.  Amidst the squalor of the Indian slums, this fast-paced gem shines right through the fast-rising garbage typical of Hollywood, as well as the garbage piling up in the Mumbai slums.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

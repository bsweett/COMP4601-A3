<meta name="summary" content="True Grit Meets Texas Chain Saw Massacre (but there's no "Good Man Is Hard to Find")"></head><body><p>After high recommendations, I watched this film with a mixture of incredulity and disappointment.  John  Wayne saved "True Grit" for me, but even the controlled, memorable performance  of John Hawkes as the rough and inscrutable yet ultimately caring brother of the daddy being sought after by the young daughter-protagonist, Ree, can't rescue this film from its own excesses.<br /><br />Normally violent scenes of mid-life hillbilly families operating as blood-related (they ARE Southern country boys and girls after all) gangbangers would be the ideal material for that narrative sub-genre known as "Southern Gothic," especially given the potential for black humor in the grotesque climactic scene in which a couple of conscience-stricken witches of the clan take Ree on an icy, night-time fishing expedition--equipped not with tackle but a power chain-saw and  in pursuit not of big ole catfish but the submerged hands of Ree's father--the evidence she requires to save her house and family.<br /><br />In this movie, the viewer has the impression that scenes like this, along with a family's ultra-violent beating of our heroine in distress (right out of "The Lottery"), are played "straight"--the menacing characters, hurt-inflicting "set pieces," edited face-slaps, and scary camera angles served up, along with the detailed, candid glimpses of everyday life, merely to show us the way folks conduct themselves in the Ozark backwoods where moonshine distilleries have been replaced by stolid rustics cooking methamphetamine (and driving Caddies) along with "Mafia-justice" country-style.  (Wordsworth would be appalled.)  The filmmakers appear clueless to the enormous potential of this material to show the viewer so much more.<br /><br />Other Southern storytellers--Dickey ("Deliverance"), McCarthy ("That Is No Country for Old Men"), above all, Flannery O'Connor (not to mention Welty, Williams, Capote and Faulkner)--go much MORE "over the top" than this movie.  But for them every detail is integral with, or essential to, the careful construction of an epiphany in which the reader/viewer finally is led to a shocking, indelible moment of life-changing self-recognition.  Such revelatory moments, or "epiphanies," James Joyce insisted, are the most significant, distinguishing feature of narrative art worthy of the name.<br /><br />In response to a student's question about a seemingly exclusive preference for movies made before 1990, I could respond: In the new millennium I've seen 2 outstanding, life-changing films: "There Will Be Blood" and "That Is No Country for Old Men" (from the brothers who brought Southern Gothic black comedy to northern Minnesota comes a movie guaranteed to make you think twice before spending another precious moment in a theater).  After films like these, a viewer becomes perhaps overly astringent in his demands of a great film.  (I almost envy those who insist that a film must simply "entertain" and not present the challenges of a Blake-like visionary artist.) There are no real epiphanies offered the spectator of this formulaic, "True Grit meets Blood Simple," pastoral aberration. In the rite-of-passage skeletal plot, even Ree's coming of age is of little interest--she's plenty tough, savvy, initiated into the business of growing up and raising a family among white-trash neighbors-on-meth from the very beginning.  Eventually, she learns to place a little more trust in the bad guys who, after all, are her kin (notwithstanding they knocked off her snitching dad, a meth cooker who was at heart a good guy too).  We, in turn, learn to stay away from movies as full of cliches, character stereotypes, and unmotivated, pointless melodrama as this one.  Or, if like the filmmakers we become enamored of the undeniable fascination of some of the more realistic, detailed vignettes of these curious country folk and the stoic but connected life they share (mostly through song), we learn that one visit is enough.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Spotless Movie"></head><body><p>This is one of the movies we luck out when it is made. Yes, while most romantic comedies are un-orignal and un-thought provoking every now and then a decent movie comes along by chance, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is nothing short of genius and made me believe in love.<br /><br />I love this movie!<br /><br />Jim Carrey gives his best performance as Joel who is determined to have his ex-girlfriend Clemintine- Kate Winslet erased from his mind. But, as the erasing process begins he remembers his horrible arugements and incidents that brought about their break-up. But, remembers the things and moments that made him love Winslet. As his memories of her begin to fade Joel realizes all he is losing and goes in a desperate race against time to remember Clemintine. It's a movie that brings a whole new meaning to you don't know what you have until it's gone. By of this movie I was close to crying.<br /><br />Kaufman has written a eleborate, touching, and funny script to the screen and deserved an Academy Award for his work. Jim Carrey has a future in romantic comedies after the first fifteen minutes I found myself swooning after him. Kate Winslet does an excellent portryal as Celmintine whose hair changes with her mood and deserved an Oscar. All in all this movie is spotless.<br />Rent or buy this one and share it with the person you love!</p></body></html>

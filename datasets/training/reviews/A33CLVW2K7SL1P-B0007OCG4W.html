<meta name="summary" content="Deception and Lies"></head><body><p>CLOSER is a film about the strange interplay between four people who richly deserve each other, as well as the disaster that they all bring to each other's lives.<br /><br />The story begins simply enough, with Dan (Jude Law) meeting "Alice" (Natalie Portman) on the street. Alice is striking in the crowd: her hair is spiked and fuchsia, and their eyes lock. While waiting at the street corner, Alice is hit by a taxi receiving minor injuries, and Dan, who we already know has an immediate attraction to her, takes her to the hospital where she receives two stitches on her leg. This begins their relationship. Dan gives Alice a very brief tour of London (he is late for work, after all), and the next thing you know it Dan is being photographed by Anna (Julia Roberts) for the author's photo on a book he has published, a book whose heroine is modeled after Alice. During the photo shoot, Dan tells Julia to "come here", and after a brief moment she moves forward, and he moves forward to her and they kiss. They both acknowledge involvement with others (indeed, Alice is meeting him there after her shift), and Anna appears to pull away. When Alice arrives, she goes to the bathroom and Dan tells Anna that he has to see her. Unfortunately, Alice heard him while he was in the bathroom, something she communicates to Anna while Anna is photographing her (she had never been professionally photographed, she says, but I believe it was really a ruse to let Anna know what she heard). Anna takes a moving and poignant photograph of tears rolling down Alice's cheeks. She says that she isn't a thief, and comments on how interesting Alice's life is. Alice makes a dismissive comment (I can't remember exactly what it was), but we learn that there isn't only one person being deceptive here - it's quite obvious that Alice has secrets of her own.<br /><br />In a bizarre and rather sexually explicit internet exchange, Dan (impersonating Anna), encourages another man, a dermatologist (Clive Owen as Larry), to meet him (her) at the aquarium. Dan sends him to the aquarium because Anna says that she often goes there. Larry goes, sees Anna (who could miss the description: big mouth, killer ****), and converses with her. It takes only a moment for Dan's deception to be made known.<br /><br />Like a play (which this is taken from), there are large jumps in time. This second jump takes us to a point where Larry and Anna are now in a relationship. This is a bit of a surprise, because Larry doesn't come across as a decent person. Indeed, in a conversation he has with Alice (while Dan and Anna are talking privately), he says, "sometimes the frog gets the princess". He may have been referring to his exterior looks, but I read it to be a metaphor for his interior ugliness, as I viewed his character more than any to be in a state of nearly constant moral decay.<br /><br />In the film, people change lovers like underwear, and Anna leaves Larry for Dan, Alice begins stripping after Dan leaves her (although in perhaps a pointed comment she tells Larry that nobody left her), and then they switch back again. "Closer" may have a deeper meaning than the one that seems obvious, but this movie seems to me more aptly titled "How to Screw Up Your Life by Cheating and Lying".<br /><br />What's of tremendous interest is that each man, after learning that their respective partner (whichever one it was at the time), is intent on knowing the exact particulars of the indiscretion. As Larry acknowledges, he wants to know because he is a caveman. That is certainly a word I would have picked if he hadn't.<br /><br />All four characters began with little innocence, and end with less. We know the least about Anna, but we can judge her by her actions - which are deplorable. Her obvious lack of happiness in the end also speaks volumes. Larry is the most obviously decrepit character, as he brazenly displays his lack of concern and care for others when, mainly, he is seeking some form of revenge. Alice is the character that seems to be the most innocent, but in the end we find out that we really know absolutely nothing about her whatsoever. And Dan - Dan perhaps wants to be as morally reprehensible as Larry, but he lacks the ability to do so. Yes, he is a cheat, a liar, and a thief (in love), but there is an innocence about him. Anna told Larry that he would cry for his mother in his sleep, and this, perhaps, explains much. It also gives us the most information we get regarding Anna and her true feelings for Dan. You don't share secrets like that unless you are making fun of the person.<br /><br />These are four deeply flawed people, but they are four people that it's not difficult to imagine meeting in everyday life.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Superb, Nails American Medical Association, Provocative"></head><body><p>Our oldest relative received a quadruple by-pass and none of us have ever had any problems with insurance, so I began the movie somewhat sceptically.  I was won over fairly quickly after that.  This is the "new new" Michael Moore, and as an estranged moderate Reblican, I attest to his value to the center.  This is a very thoughtfully put together movie, very artful in combining interviews and news clips, and I now see the depth of despair that hits those disqualified by mendacious insurance comapnies.  With the help of this movie, I now understand medical math: keep the middle happy, and screw over the poorest of the poor who fall into that smaller category of "catastrophically expensive" medicine.  In essence, the medical industry is practicing genocide/medical triage, based on income and cost, not on need.  Now that *should* be a crime.<br /><br />He opens with Ronald Reagan, one of my personal heros, and thus disconcerting to see "selling" the concept of socialized medicine to create the hospital industry.  I lunch regularly with Jim Turner, #2 Naderite who continues to do for health and food what Nader did for cars, and we talk often, not about whether health should be nationalized and universal, which we think it should, but rather about why the American Medican Association continues to focus exclusively on profitable remediation and drugs, does everything it can to conceal and drive out of business those who offer natural and alternative cures, and ignores completely the benefits of preventive medicine in the form of healthy life style and healthy environment.<br /><br />He opens his damnation of Congress by pointing out that as a Senator, Hillary Clinton was bought--her silence was bought--for $800,000.  That is one reason I think Senator Obama contrasts so  well with her: Mrs. Clinton is "old partisan polkitics," Ron Paul and Barack Obama are "new transpartisan citizen-driven" politics.<br /><br />I have four pages of notes on this movie.  I took it seriously, and I will also watch John Q now, a movie I avoided despite the great stars.<br /><br />The obscene costs of medicine are dramatically illustrated, and in one case, a person is told they can choose which of two fingers to attach, one for $40K the other for $60K.  That really IS sicko.<br /><br />The middle part of the movie is a superb review of Canadian, British, and French medicine and may have included Nordic as well.<br /><br />He returns to the US, and to point out how our current health care system has been manipulated for profit and shielded from excellence by the AMA, asking--very intelligently and pointedly--why we have such excellent police, firefighters, and teachers who are "provided."  He's right.  The AMA and Mrs. Clinton are wrong.  We need to follow the French/Cuban models (more on that at the end).<br /><br />There are some sensational and intellectually satisfying interviews in this movie.  A couple of highlights:<br /><br />+ Labor Leader in UK: US is willing to spend trillions killing others, why not spend billions healing its own?<br /><br />+ UK doctors get substantial bonuses for improving the health of their assigned sector.<br /><br />+ Giving poor the vote led to the corruption of Congress.<br /><br />+ People who are healthy, educated, and confident are harder to govern.  Both Wall Street and Washington *want* "working poor" and "fearful populations.  TIME TO END THAT.<br /><br />+ Corporations use health benefits to enslave and discourage movement.<br /><br />+ Keiser will deny coverage if the individual--not matter how acute their condition-refuses or cannot get to a hospital *owned* by Kaiser.  THAT ought to be criminal.<br /><br />+ France, by the testimony of Americans living there, is the most family-friendly country on the planet, down to providing mother's helpers so mothers can have two four hour blocks during the week to care for their house and husband without concern.<br /><br />The movie documents the scandalous misbehavior of Los Angeles hospitals of "dumping" patients, dressed only in a thin hospital gown, by taxi in the vicinity of but not directly in front of a rescue mission for the homeless.  I watched this on security video in horror.<br /><br />He then moves into 9/11 health aftermath.  I personally believe that President Bush is impeachable on a number of counts, but supressing the extreme danger of the asbestos released by the controlled demolitions of the three buildings (Larry Silverstein's dream--conspire with insurance companies to empty the building of insured gold, get a portion of the seven billions to reconstruct the WTC after it is brought down and cleared at taxpayer expense....  In my lifetime, we will see the truth come out about Bush, Cheney, Guliani, Rumsfeld and others who have disgraced our Nation--lying to the firefighters and the citizens of New York is one reason I consider Rudy "scoop and dump" Guliani to be toast.<br /><br />The movie moves to a close by discovering that terrorists being held captive at Guantanamo receive the best of medical care, free, at our expense, at the same time that 9/11 workers go begging.  There is a dramatic staged effort to reach Guantanamo via boat, then they suddenly appear in Cuba, probably via jet arranged in advance with the Cuban government.<br /><br />The movie closes with the 9/11 firefighters receiving the best free treatment on the planet, and being honored by Cuban firefighters who come to attention for them.  I was moved on a number of fronts.<br /><br />First, Cuba and the Amish have the only sustainable agricultural practices on the planet;<br /><br />Second, Cuba can afford to send 10,000 doctors to Venezuela for a prolonged period, and we cannot take care of our own.<br /><br />Third, my libertarian roots vis a vis the Federal Government are reinforced.  This is a government that makes war and betrays the trust of the American people, and I hold BOTH the Democratic and Republican partisan machines to blame.  We need Electoral Reform to include an end to the "winner take all" nonsense.<br /><br />This is a great movie.  On Monday I will be sending Michael Moore a fax outlining the Earth Intelligence Network model for healing the planet.  The model starts with the ten high level threats to humanity, among wich poverty (caused by government and industrial corruption), disease, and environmental degradation outrank war, the twelve policies (agriculture, diplomacy, economy, education, energy, family, health, immigration, justice, security, society, and water), must be addressed not just for the US and Europe, but for the eight challengers as well (Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Iran, Russia, Venezuela, and Wild Cards like Malaysia, Pakistan, South Africa, and Turkey).  If Michael Moore can repeat this success in vignette form for each of the other 29 factors. we get our country back.<br /><br />BRAVO.<br /><br />See also my reviews below and also my lists.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FBH3W2">Why We Fight</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007DBJM8">The Corporation</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BTH4K4">Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060931841">Rule by Secrecy: The Hidden History That Connects the Trilateral Commission, the Freemasons, and the Great Pyramids</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452287081">Confessions of an Economic Hit Man</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0930852370">9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA, Fourth Edition</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0865715408">Crossing the Rubicon: The Decline of the American Empire at the End of the Age of Oil</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400065763">Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency</a></p></body></html>

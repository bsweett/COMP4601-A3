<meta name="summary" content="It's a Wonderful Movie!"></head><body><p>This rates up with my top 5 favorite movies of all time.  I grew up on the Donna Reed show and remember that this was the movie I always saw her in and she was a lot more beautiful then.  James Stewart is great as George Baily, the guy who wanted to help everybody and sacrificed his own financial success.<br /><br />The idea that one doesn't realize one's worth until you are removed from the equation has been copied hundreds of times since but never as well as this movie.<br /><br />Clarence is probably the most enjoyable bumbling character that I have ever seen.  There is a cameo by an adult Alfalfa Sweitzer (for the Our Gang series) and the characters of Bert and Ernie later were immortalized by Sesame Street.<br /><br />The ending of this movie is the "feel good" ending of all-time!</p></body></html>

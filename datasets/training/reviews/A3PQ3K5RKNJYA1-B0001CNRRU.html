<meta name="summary" content="Bleak and depressing look at bleak and depressing indiviuals"></head><body><p>The color, backdrops, pace and acting (yes, the acting was very good) lent to a very "downer" of a movie. Sure, I've watched a lot of movies that have had ongoing depressing scenes that ended in a sad story. Well, this is one of them.<br /><br />Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts give their best to a movie that shows the down-trodden lives of people who've hit bottom in some very tragic circumstances. You get a taste of betrayal, deception, lies and confusion, all rolled into one.<br /><br />I really don't know how to truly classify this movie other than that I would never want to watch it again. Yes, it is a "thought-provoking" movie with some very emotional and touching moments, but there is no reward in the end.</p></body></html>

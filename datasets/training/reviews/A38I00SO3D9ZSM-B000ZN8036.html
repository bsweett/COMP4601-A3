That is, I don't have a single feeling about it but many.  Taking everything into account (acting, dialogue, cinematography), it's quite good as a film.  The story left me dismayed and disturbed.  The man behind the story, Chris McCandless, in my view, was more flawed than hero.  Some may see his adventures and his views on life as romantic or noble.  I found him to be naive, selfish, immature and ignorant of the power of nature.  The things he saw, though, must have been incredible.  In the two years in which all the action takes place, "Alexander Supertramp" lived two or three lifetimes, putting into action the old rock n' roll cliche, "It's better to burn out than to fade away."</p></body></html>

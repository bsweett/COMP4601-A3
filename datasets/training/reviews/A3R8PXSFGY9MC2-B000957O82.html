<meta name="summary" content="Hitch"></head><body><p>`Hitch' is an above average romantic comedy which has some genuinely funny laugh out loud moments and plenty of Will Smiths charm and humour. Smiths character, Hitch, is a dating consultant who, whilst easing the path of many geeky men in their own lovelives, has trouble wooing the lady he is interested in himself. This makes for many funny scenes where he coaches his clients to be suave and sophisticated on the one hand and then watching him royally mess things up on the other. The scene where Hitch has an allergic reaction to shellfish is especially funny and Smith carries it off with style. This isn't an amazing Hollywood blockbuster, or trying to be some deep meaningful art piece, it is a simple fun romantic comedy and as that is all it's trying to achieve, it carries it off well. Worth a look on a lazy Sunday afternoon or to rent on a quiet date night in.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

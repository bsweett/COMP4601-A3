Driven by the absence of fatherly love and the last words his father said to him,"If you ain't first, you're last", Ricky Bobby is the #1 NASCAR driver in the country.  Racing alongside Ricky is his best friend, Cal Naughton, Jr. (John C. Reilly) who always finishes #2.  Together they are "Shake N' Bake".  The owner of Bobby's racing team Mr. Dennit (Pat Hingle) dies and his son, Larry, Jr. (Greg Germann) takes over.  Larry Jr. has always disliked Ricky Bobby and decides to bring a French Formula One driver, Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen) into the NASCAR circuit as part of the Dennit racing team.  After a serious accident, Ricky is left emotionally scarred and unable to race.  His wife kicks Ricky out of the house, divorces him, and marries Cal. Jr.  A few traffic accidents later, Ricky finds himself as a bicycle pizza delivery guy desperately needing a kick in the pants and some inspiration which his long-lost father provides.<br /><br />TALLADEGA NIGHTS is full of humor, both crass and otherwise.  Much of the humor skewers NASCAR and racing fans.  Despite this, the movie is not vicious in its comedy and attitude towards the sport.  Instead, the film seems to carry with it a slight amount of affection towards racing.  Having been raised in a rural area around racing fans, I picked up on many of the over-the-top stereotypes right away, yet was not offended.<br /><br />The movie has a lot of great quotes and contains some brilliant comic acting.  John C. Reilly is one of the best actors in the business, but I would never have pictured him as the sidekick in a Will Ferrell comedy.  Reilly nails the role of Cal Naughton, Jr. and in doing so raised my esteem for him as an actor.  Also worthy of mention is Sacha Baron Cohen as Jean Girard.  Until this film, I had never heard of Cohen, but I've been told that he is an up and coming comical actor to watch.  His performance in TALLADEGA NIGHTS is impressive and has made me want to watch some of his other work, e.g. Ali G.  Michael Clarke Duncan (who is made to look normal-sized through various camera techniques) is also a joy to watch in this film as Ricky's pit manager, Lucius Washington.  The movie also has a simple message that it attempts to deliver (something about not taking the important things in your life for granted), but make no mistake this is a comedy and most of that message is lost through the hilarious quotes and hysterical actions.<br /><br />TALLADEGA NIGHTS is one of the best Will Ferrell films to have been made in the last few years.  Actually, I enjoyed it even better than ANCHORMAN and other movies he has made and consider it my favorite Ferrell film.  It's a hilarious look at NASCAR that tries illustrates a need for speed in life isn't as important as taking time to slow down and enjoy the finer and simpler things in life, such as family.</p></body></html>

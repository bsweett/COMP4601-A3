<meta name="summary" content="Another True Lies?  NOT!"></head><body><p>This poor attempt at re-creating the magic of True Lies fails miserably.  Both Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie are extremely stiff in their roles as the stereotypical upper-middle class couple in appearance that are secretly government operatives.  Of course their next sanctions are each other.  Their attempts at murdering each other is way below the caliber of The War of the Roses and Vince Vaughn plays a poor version of Tom Arnold's character from True Lies.  The special effects pale compare to any of the Charlies Angel's films or even True Lies which is about 15 years old.  Better to wait for this one to come to cable than to waste your money on it!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="As a Comic to Screen, This Film Is Worthy of Four Stars"></head><body><p>Say Fantastic Four to most people on the planet and they'll say, "What? Who?"<br /><br />Say Batman and everyone nods.<br /><br />The Fantastic Four was the first comic that Marvel Comics produced in the early 1960's. It preceded Spiderman and the XMen. Even so, it has remained largely a comic fan's comic book, considered somewhat unaccessible by the public at large. Why? Well, I have my own thoughts, but I'm sure they're just my own. Suffice it to say, that the Fantastic Four (the comic of which has never been one I've been interested in) film stands up quite well when placed side by side against other comics to films.<br /><br />As with any such film, the absolute intent is for there to be more than one film. Why? Well, you've got to do a lot of suspension of disbelief as well as introduction of characters and their intentions and their psyche. If those aren't incorporated, you end up with a hollow film with no emotional center (remember Batman and Robin?).<br /><br />Marvel and their film production partners have wisely made the decision to ground all their comic films in modern reality. This means New York is New York and not Gotham City - some bizarro world alternate reality. To do so, means that the comic to film characters must become flesh and blood believable. In this film, Marvel has scored.<br /><br />Ioan Gruffudd as Mr. Fantastic is sincere and extremely believable as a man on a mission but who tries to push his own feelings away. Jessica Alba as the Invisible Woman is certainly sexy, but more importantly, Ms. Alba brings a nuanced confidence to the role that it needed. Michal Chiklas as The Thing could not be any finer. Thank heaven technology caught up to comics so that the Thing could be "real" and not CGI, so that Chiklas' acting comes through far more intensely than the costume he wears. Dr. Doom's backstory has been tweeked to make it more accessible and "believable" to the audience. Is it effective? You bet. I keep finding that Marvel's film developments often surpass the "realities" of their comic counterparts, making them more believable and reality based, while maintaining the fantasy aspects so necessary to the stories. And finally, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm, the Human Torch. Wow! This could have really been screwed up. The Human Torch's popularity has surpassed that of the Fantastic Four, garnering him his own series of comics from time to time.  He's a smart alec and a cocky SOB. Initially, I understand, the producers were just going to have the character be able to shoot flames from his hands, thus making him truly a "human torch", but somewhere along the line, they kept the character as in the comics and he is fully "on fire". Evans and Chiklas steal the show with their character portrayals, and the script still lets their humanity come through.<br /><br />As with any introductory film, the script is forced to be overtly heavy in exposition and backstory. However, seeing that this film was a success, doubtless there will be a sequel, which should mean that it will be able to be nothing but a non-stop thrill ride.<br /><br />Even so, while often burdened with too much expostional material, in the long run this film needed it and it suceeds because of it.<br /><br />No, it's certainly not perfect, but I'll not fault the producers too much. The casting was perfect and the special effects were just dynamite. I'm looking forward to the next installment.</p></body></html>

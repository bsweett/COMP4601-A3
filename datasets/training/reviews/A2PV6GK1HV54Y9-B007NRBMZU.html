The director's cut alternate ending is probably better than the original ending. Ashton Kutcher looks out of place in this role, and Amy Smart always pulls off a convincing performance. They have great chemistry together but the plot is a little far-fetched and contrived. This is one film you will either love or hate, for me it just gave me a headache.</p></body></html>

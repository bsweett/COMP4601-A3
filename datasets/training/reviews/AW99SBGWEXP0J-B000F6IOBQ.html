<meta name="summary" content="Underworld: Evolution"></head><body><p>Picking up where "Underworld" left off, Selena (Beckinsale) and Michael (Speedman) are on the run.  They have just killed Viktor (Nighy), and now Marcus (Curran) is after them.  He is even older than Viktor, and a twin brother who is the original werewolf.  And, while all this is going on, someone else (Jacobi) is plotting something mysterious.<br /><br />Fans of the original will not be disappointed with the sequel.  In addition to the continuing story, some backstory is also given, setting up the action that takes place in the present.  Beckinsale and Speedman seem comfortable returning to their roles, and the new cast members do good jobs as well.  The special effects are on par with the original, and the action is intense.  Fans of the first definately want to check this out, and newcomers will find this movie accessable as well.</p></body></html>

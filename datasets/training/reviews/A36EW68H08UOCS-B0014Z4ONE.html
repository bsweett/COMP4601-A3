<meta name="summary" content="Raiders is the best, BUT....."></head><body><p>Raiders of the Lost Ark is on nearly every &quot;Best Movies Ever Made&quot; list in existence.  I have seen it more than any other film, probably 30 times or more, and I have seen it on small tv's with grainy VHS and up on the Huge Screen of the Fox Theater in Atlanta with 6 channel Dolby - and I have loved it every time.<p>It's hard to imagine more of a dream team of producer/director than George Lucas and Steven Spielberg and they put all their creative energies into producing an action/adventure movie that grabs you in the first moments and barely lets up until the credits roll.<p>The American Film Institute ranks it among the top 100 films of all time.  Roger Ebert numbers it among his Greatest Films.  I personally consider it the most rip-roarin' fun you can have in front of a movie screen. <p>Harrison Ford gives the performance of 100 lifetimes as Indiana Jones - AFI's #2 Screen Hero, right behind Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird and ahead of everybody else including James Bond and Bogart's Rick from Casablanca.  The supporting cast fills in every nook and cranny with performances that are a sheer pleasure to watch.  The special effects, done back in the days before Computer Generated stuff had been invented, will absolutely knock your socks off and in scene after scene I remember thinking &quot;how the heck did they DO that?&quot;  Moments that elicit a bemused grin earlier on are reprised on a larger scale later on in a way that stretches that grin from ear to ear, such as early on in &quot;Raiders&quot; when Indy tells his pilot, Jacques, that he &quot;HATES snakes&quot; as Jacques &quot;pet snake, Reggie&quot; is slithering across his lap.  Later on they discover that the highly sought-after Ark is stored in a room inhabited by probably the largest collection of snakes ever gathered.  &quot;Snakes...&quot; Harrison deadpans for our enjoyment. &quot;Why'd it hafta be snakes?&quot;  Fearless Indy's dread of snakes shows up in the second movie, then is entertainingly explained in the third. John William's score ices the whole thing.<p>At present time we can thankfully acquire the entire Indiana Jones Trilogy, BUT... if you only wanted one of the three movies you're out of luck.<p>Harrison Ford successfully reprises Indiana Jones in the other two movies, but neither quite reach the spectacular glory of &quot;Raiders&quot;.<p>&quot;Temple of Doom&quot; is the darkest of the three, with subplots involving enslaved children and human sacrifice, and Kate &quot;Mrs. Spielberg&quot; Capshaw is a good deal more shrill as the female lead than the spunky Karen Allen is in &quot;Raiders&quot;.<p>&quot;The Last Crusade&quot; comes midway between the two films in terms of sheer enjoyment and two good casting strokes were made with Sean Connery as Indy's Dad and the late River Phoenix as the young scout Indy. (We even get to see a fictionalized version of how Indy/Harrison got that scar on his chin, and why he hates snakes - the kind of entertaining fluorish that FILLS these movies.)<p>Sooooo.... in conclusion I think that this set is an absolute &quot;must have&quot;. There is a fourth disc in the set with little documentaries that answer those &quot;how did they DO that!?&quot; questions I had, but you the DVD buyer doesn't have much choice.  Maybe like the &quot;Godfather&quot; series there will be individual reissues of The Adventures of Indiana Jones.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="GOOD BUT, A LITTLE LONG AND TEDIOUS!"></head><body><p>I watched this movie within hours of watching 'The Illusionist'. I think I have had my fill of "magic" for a while. 'The Prestige' is a superior film to 'The Illusionist' in many ways. It was not as easy to see where it was going and the characters were more fleshed out. I did find it a little too long and tedious, with a trim here and there it would have made this a much better film. Movies like this are spoiled by the surprise ending so, rent this don't buy it. 3 1/2 stars for keeping me guessing to the end.</p></body></html>

Every frames are picture perfect and Ridley himself even remarked jokingly that he's been categorised as a visualist (looks good but no substance).  Despite that this movie is better viewed in the cinema, the second dic with the extra features are exemplary in this instance.  There are two substantial documentaries that allow the viewers to understand deeper about the Crusades, comparing the facts against the fiction, getting a glimpse of the thoughts and reflections of the actors and actresses, planning process, production process and so forth.  In many other DVD compilation, we would have behind the scene extra which is more like a promotional material but not here, where all documentaries have gotten substance to them.  The movie is very relevant in today's situation where Muslims are still proclaiming jihad towards the infidels and Christians (in the form of USA with its supporters) invade and occupy Iraq and now, talking about exerting its muscle power towards Syria and Iran.  Then, there's the problem spot itself, Jerusalem where Muslims are still fending themselves or exerting themselves against the might of the Jews and the Christians.  The movie's intent is obvious.  It's actually an anti-war movie that believes in forward thinking leadership and resolving conflict towards dialogues and working together as shown by King Baldwin and Salahuddin.  Can you imagine President Bush and Osama coming face to face and working through an uneasy alliance?  This movie is different from The Gladiators because the focus is never on Maximus but about Jerusalem itself.  Characters that are featured in the movie form the total sum of the movie.  The whole time sitting through the movie, it never comes to me that it's about Balian but about conflicting and amiable personalities that either work against or for one another.  Don't take my word for it but this movie is a grand epic and very well-executed.  God is in details and from little subtle hints given in the picture shots, we get to understand the society, the philosophy, the costume, the diet, the geography  , the architecture, the warefare and its weaponary of its time.  The gesture of Salahuddin picking up a fallen cross and putting it right on the table mindfully is a very potent symbol of his respect and tolerance of other religion.  The movie brings forth a point that some people use religion for the greater good and some people hide behind the facade or religion to garner power and influence.  Once they are corrupted by power, they are incorrigible and would start committing evil.  It's quite remarkable that one of the Ten Commandments is Thou Shall Not Kill and yet, people can't still abide by TEN simple Commandments.  A memorable movie that anyone should have in their collections.  Highly recommended.  I'm really saddened by the fact that it didn't do well in the box-office.  Perhaps, it's due to people's denial of the inherent message in the movie, a movie that shows a more humane side of the Muslims, where the American market can't and won't accept right now especially when their sons and daughters are fighting a war that doesn't belong to them.</p></body></html>

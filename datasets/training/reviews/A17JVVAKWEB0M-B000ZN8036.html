<meta name="summary" content="Faithful Adaptation of a Fine Book"></head><body><p>*SPOILER WARNING* If you know nothing of this story, nearly all reviews give away the "ending".  Therefore, if you don't want to know anything about the plot of the film, don't read any reviews...including this one.<br /><br />The book's cover tells the story; a young idealist from a well-to-do family gives away his money and possessions before trudging into the Alaskan wild on a quest for spiritual awakening.  Four months later, his body is discovered by moose hunters.  Christopher McCandless' story can be reduced to those few words, so why do readers of Jon Krakauer's book about McCandless trek twenty miles into the unforgiving wilderness to visit his final resting place?  Why has he become the center of a cult-like mythology and the inspiration for Sean Penn's graceful biopic?<br /><br />Like Krakaeur, readers of "Into the Wild" and other people who have heard of McCandless' story on television, in newspapers or around a crackling fire surrounded by wanderers, Penn became bewitched by the young man so certain of the redemptive power of natural purity, self reliance and isolation that he cast off his worldly possessions after an impressive academic career at Emory University and tramped throughout the Western US.  Unlike judgmental critics who can't understand the longing within McCandless to explore a life of innocence untouched by the trappings of society, Penn felt the same desires within and set out to capture the story on screen.  Even those who dislike Penn (count me among you) should see within him many of the same idealistic, uncompromising traits of McCandless and the same subtle disappointment at the world for not sharing his aesthetics.<br /><br />Penn's film is a remarkably consistent adaptation of Krakauer's work.  But just like the book, the film will receive mixed reviews from audiences.  Some people simply can't (or won't) listen to McCandless.  Whether there exists within the viewer a connection to the natural world, a desire to discern the boundaries of mankind's ability to survive in a perilous environment and a hunger for incorruptible truth and sometimes painful honesty will play heavily into the reward/enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />Chris McCandless never outlived the phase many young adults experience in their years after college or high school when they first realize the ugliness of the world.  Penn's film traces the last years of his life, showing his hero to be wide-eyed and childlike, as he holds to a simplistic belief that people just need to be good to each other to make the most out of their short time on earth.  On his odyssey tramping throughout the West, McCandless encounters a Homer-like string of splendid characters.  But even with a string of rewarding relationships with people who view him with a aura of mysticism, a Holden Caulfield-like epiphanies about deceit and phoniness of the world draws Chris to the one place he knows he can find truth: into the wild.<br /><br />FILM DIFFERENCES/STRENGTHS<br />The most obvious difference in the book and the film is the "suspense" created by holding off his death until the end.  While the book is an investigation into a dead man (although we see him certainly as a very vivid and vital dead man), the film keeps him alive until the very end.  Viewers unfamiliar with the story may wonder why the tale is even being told, especially when it seems he is about to walk to safety.<br /><br />I don't consider myself among the "the book is always better" crowd, because I think the film medium allows for unambiguous depictions of images, scenery, etc.  I was unfamiliar with the Lake Mead canyons where he kayaked or the channels that floated him into Mexico.  No description in a book could help me see those things like the film does.  Penn also takes advantage of a great device where he uses uncomfortable camera angles and quick, jerky cuts whenever Chris is in a city and juxtaposes them with spectacular views from some of the more beautiful stops of Chris' life.</p></body></html>

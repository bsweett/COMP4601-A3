<meta name="summary" content="Mediocre"></head><body><p>James Mangold, the director who brought us such flawed but interesting<br />films as Copland and Girl, Interrupted, has done it again. He has<br />crafted another flawed but interesting film, Walk The Line, named after<br />one of Cash's biggest musical hits; this one on the life of Johnny<br />Cash. Actress Reese Witherspoon won an Oscar for Best Actress for her<br />portrayal of Cash's wife June Carter Cash, of the famed Carter Family<br />singers, and while she's solid, competent, the award she won is merely<br />another way for Hollywood to elevate the bankability of sexy young<br />starlets- think Marissa Tomei, Mira Sorvino, Gwyneth Paltrow, Julia<br />Roberts, Angelina Jolie, Hilary Swank, Renee Zellwegger, Charlize<br />Theron, and now Witherspoon. Financially, for the long term of the<br />industry, this makes sense, so that, even decades from now, films they<br />appear in can bear the Oscar imprint.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix, who portrays Cash, however, is completely out of his<br />league as the infamous Man In Black....Cinematographer Phedon<br />Papamichael adds little to the film. His framing and vistas do little<br />to enhance texture of the scenes, nor do they add an unconscious poetic<br />element. Despite globetrotting, Cash's life is portrayed as static and<br />dull, and the love story is nothing great. What Mangold does not grasp<br />is that the real reason cash is worthy of a film is because of his<br />singing and songwriting. When will biopics about artists actually focus<br />on the art, and not the soap operatic stuff? But, if they are going to<br />focus on the peripherals, one would think they'd play up the<br />fascinating stuff, the legendary stuff, not the usual crap all people<br />go through, for that merely shows that the subject is like the viewer,<br />when the fascination stems from what the subject has that is NOT like<br />the average person. In other words, as the saying goes, always print<br />the legend over the truth. Walk The Line never trots down that alley.</p></body></html>

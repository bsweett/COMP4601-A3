<meta name="summary" content="A medieval tapestry of love and hate."></head><body><p>Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty, while being one of the few Disney features to be shot in 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratio, is also one of its most ambitious and lush projects to date. The classic story of the princess  Aurora, hidden from the evil clutches of Malificent in a forest cottage  with three fairies, is brought to life with beautiful animation matched  only by that of Beauty and the Beast. The songs, most of which are taken  from the classical score by Tchaikowsky's ballad, sweep the viewer into a  lush and sometimes gothic epitaph that never fails to bring each character,  as well as their surroundings, to life. I'm pleading with Disney to please  bring this movie out on DVD so that everyone can enjoy the widescreen  release of this totally enthralling film.</p></body></html>

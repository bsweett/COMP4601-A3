The movie opened simply, but I know from minute one that it was going to be a blast. The violence was so intense, but somehow not overpowering, at least not most of it. There were a few scenes that made me cringe; however, these were necessary to the power of the film. Having never read the books (although I hear that the movie is a mirror copy) I was a little shocked. I have seen worse, but this was coming from a "Comic book..." oh well. I loved the cast. Willis, Rourke, Alba, Dawson, Owen, and even Hartnett, Murphy, and Wood played it cool. I was also glad to see the emergence of some new faces, who actually got good air time! These included _2 Fast 2 Furious's_  Devon Aoki as the unconquerable Miho and the beautiful and extremely talented _Gilmore Girl_  Alexis Bledel as Becky, the backstabbing prostitute.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is unbeatable, the use of color is wild and brilliant; it accentuates the drama and gore to an extreme - bringing the characters to life. And yes, it is true, the majority of the women are hookers in this film, but they are far from helpless. I would recommend this movie to anyone old enough (and with an open enough mind) to comprehend the beauty in the madness. It takes formidable jabs at the hypocrisy that plagues the Church and the police, while glorifying the everyday, flawed, hero. It applauds loyalty and loathes treachery - important in a workable society. The more I think about this film, the more I think it may be - dare I say - Inspirational.</p></body></html>

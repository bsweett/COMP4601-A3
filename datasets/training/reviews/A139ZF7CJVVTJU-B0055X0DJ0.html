Sure, it was silly and cheesy, but within the movie's concept of "logic," it was both forgiveable and fun.  It was exactly what I expected it to be, no more and no less.<br /><br />This film was much, much less.  So much less that even the spectacular fight scenes grew tiresome and monotonous.<br /><br />Here's the skinny:<br /><br />The plot is breath-takingly idiotic.  Sam's home is beseiged by a dozen or so tiny (and seemingly spontaneous) Decepticon bots right before he leaves for college.  Bumblebee jumps in and (chaotically) saves the day.  Moments later, Sam tells Bumblebee that he isn't taking the Autobot with him to college for reasons that make no sense whatsoever.  Add to this an annoying and absurd subplot about Sam having difficulty saying the "love" word to his uber-perfect girlfriend.<br /><br />About that girlfriend: scriptwriters, please give your characters flaws.  Megan Fox's character is perfect in every conceivable way, from her patience with Sam to the sultry way she bends over engines as she fixes them.  She and Sam have endured life-changing (and -threatening) situations together, and yet, Sam still can't bring himself to tell her how much she means to him.  As soon as the couple begins arguing about the "L" word, you know immediately what the climax of the film will entail.<br /><br />The Earth has also been beset with an unusually high number of violent and high-profile Decepticon attacks.  In the face of this, what does the American government do?  In the greatest plot contrivance of all, a liason from the president not only kicks the Autobots off the planet, he does so with a speech that conveniently (for the audience and the Decepticon) lays out every weakness and detail of the country's experience with the Transformers.<br /><br />These are just a few of the film's gaping holes.  In order to distract from these, the creators added the following window dressing, ostensibly to titillate and amuse:<br /><br />--a pointless scene involving Sam's mom and some illegal brownies<br /><br />--two jive-talking robots with golden buck teeth and huge ears; when these characters first appeared, I turned to a friend who had come with me to the IMAX and said, "Is it just me, or are those things racist?"  My friend held up his forefinger and thumb and said, "Yeah.  Just a bit."<br /><br />--a new kind of Decepticon that stretches credulity; let's just say it can shift into some really hot shapes<br /><br />--the robots are given more human characteristics than ever before, including breath, farts, and anatomically correct groins<br /><br />Other things I couldn't help but notice:<br /><br />--it takes the Decepticons roughly five minutes to break into and take over a top-secret, ultra-secure military compound, but they have an extraordinary amount of difficulty stealing a purse from an 18 year old girl on a motorbike<br /><br />--Sam's dormroom is so full of gorgeous coeds that they actually have a character explain the abnormal ratio of hot chicks<br /><br />--Rainn Wilson is under-utilized as a smarmy professor in a classroom scene that contributes almost nothing to the plot<br /><br />--a military official, when he receives an anonymous transmission from a character telling him to fire the government's most dangerous, most top secret weapon at one of the three pyramids in Egypt only hesitates about half a second before going ahead and doing it<br /><br />--Shia LeBeouf and Megan Fox have absolutely no chemistry this time around; it took me about five minutes to realize that they were flirting when they started talking about breaking up.<br /><br />See it for the fight scenes, I guess, but try not to think too hard.  Or at all.</p></body></html>

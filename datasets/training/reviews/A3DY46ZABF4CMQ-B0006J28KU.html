In 1995, it finally happened!<br /><br />That year, director Michael Mann (Ali) convinced the two strongest actors of our time Oscar winners Robert Deniro (Raging Bull) and Al Pacino (Scent Of A Woman) to co-star in the intense action thriller Heat. Heat would become the stars' second shared credit in a movie together, the first being The Godfather Part 2, in which both actors did not appear together in any of the scenes, and Deniro won a supporting actor Oscar for.<br /><br />Pacino plays LAPD Lt. Vincent Hanna, while Deniro plays heist master Neil McCauley. Hanna is aching to bust McCauley in the act, and McCauley knows Hanna's every move. Two of them are the flipside of one another. Hanna's got family problems, McCauley's got a love interest who thinks he's a salesman. Hanna is great at his job in putting crooks away, McCauley is great at his 'job' in stealing millions of dollars and getting away with it.<br /><br />We sit, watch and anticipate the moment that these two powerful men meet. When they do, it's for a cup of coffee in a restaurant, where each rival sets the other one straight. Neither will hesitate in killing the other if they ever cross each other or come face to face while in the line of duty, even if it will risk uncovering McCauley's true identity and losing the woman he loves.<br /><br />Director Mann takes a back seat and lets his star-studded cast which includes Val Kilmer (The Doors), Tom Sizemore (Saving Private Ryan), Jon Voight (Runaway Train), Mykelti Williamson (Forrest Gump), Natalie Portman (Star Wars Episode 3: Return Of The Sith), and Ashley Judd (Kiss The Girls) lead us into one of the most memorable mindblowing movie experiences of the past 10 years! Deniro and Pacino each delivers an outstanding performance in a movie that perfectly teams them up.<br /><br />Bring on the Heat!<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A+</p></body></html>

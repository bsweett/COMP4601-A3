<meta name="summary" content="Flat. plodding agenda laden film"></head><body><p>I should have guessed that Sean Penn and Hollywood would become increasingly unable to make good decent film without using them as a springboard for their political views (most of which are wrong of course).<br /><br />I had high hopes for this film and only gave it 2 stars because of Nicole Kidman.<br /><br />The story plods along SLOWLY and PAINFULLY with no tension, no anxiety.... in fact, you dont care for any of the characters in the least.<br /><br />This feels like on of those 70s films like "All the Presidents Men" that simply puts you to sleep.<br /><br />Lost of talk and attempts at creating a storyline about attempting to stop the supposed assassination of some tyrannical leader of a 3rd world country.<br /><br />It's hard to care to much if he gets knocked off or not.<br /><br />Penn and Kidman's characters seem stilted and stiff.<br /><br />Simply put...... the film has ZERO suspense, ZERO tension, and stirs ZERO interest for the characters.<br /><br />It simply does not come together and WORK like a good "magical movie" like Shawshenk Redemption, Door to Door, Straight Story or other great non-action movies do.<br /><br />A high budget clunker.</p></body></html>

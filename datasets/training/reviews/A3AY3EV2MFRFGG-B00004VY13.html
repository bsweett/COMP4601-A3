<meta name="summary" content="Arguably Carpenter's finest hour."></head><body><p>This gooey-ooey horror/science fiction hybrid is arguably John Carpenter's best film.<p>An isolated American Weather Research Outpost in Antartica gets caught in the final crossfire of what they discover has been a battle to the death between a neighboring Norwegian Outpost and a hostile alien organism, one that can absorb and perfectly imitate any lifeform on Earth.  Too late they uncover clues that one or two of them may not be the humans they once were.  The battle begins anew as a six month long night falls and a violent storm (constantly heard howling and moaning in the background) closes in.<p>Carpenter's nihilist leanings have never been more focused than in this, his first big studio film.  His story of humanity cracking (as opposed to coming together) under pressure from a destructive threat make for seat squirming suspense.  Rob Bottin's stunning make-up and alien designs (still brilliant to this day) add visual symbolic punch to the humanity torn apart by its own fears allegory (dig the alien's phobia inspired manifestations).  Kurt Russell makes for a fine reluctant hero who flat out refuses to loose, even when he does.  Grim and disturbing, reviled by fans and critics upon its initial release (the scars of which still sting Carpenter to this day), The Thing is a classic that only gets richer with repeated viewings.  Do yourself a favor, see it in the widescreen for full effect.  An essential thriller.</p></body></html>

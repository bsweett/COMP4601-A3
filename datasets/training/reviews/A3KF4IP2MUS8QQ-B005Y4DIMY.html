<meta name="summary" content="More gore with your compelling storyline? Yes, please"></head><body><p>Hellraiser is an extreme horror lover's dream come true.  Clive Barker's unique vision marked a virtual rebirth of the genre at a time when slasher sequels were the fun, yet predictable, norm.  Although the premiere setting for viewing this movie is a crowded theater of screamers (and sick puppies like myself who find humor in gore), one can still achieve a quite satisfactory effect watching this movie alone in the dark.  Some horror creators rely on blood and gore for its own sake, others rely on the story itself to produce the desired effect.  Clive Barker is one of the few horror geniuses who can make copious amounts of gore an integral and necessary part of the story.  Hellraiser can be deliciously gross, so those with weak stomachs should beware.  It features rats; decayed, maggot-infested meat; and copious amounts of blood--and that's just the teaser.  Later there are acts of cold-blooded murder,  human dismemberment by arrays of chains, a partially formed, pus-dripping, oozing carcass, and then the incredible Cenobites themselves.<p>The movie at its simplest level is a retelling of a story that goes back to Goethe's Doctor Faustus and beyond--when you sell your soul to evil forces, you will regret it.  Frank Cotton is a despicable, uncaring man who has grown bored with life's most extreme pleasures.  When he hears about and eventually acquires a puzzle box which can open the door to a new world of perverse pleasures, he finds out that one man's pleasure is another man's pain under the tutelage of the Cenobites.  Somehow, he manages to escape the other world, and when his brother's blood is spilled in his chamber of horrors, his body begins to reform itself.  More blood is required to complete the job, and his brother's wife Julia supplies it by picking up men at bars and bringing them home for Frank's nourishment.  The prim and proper Julia was ravaged by Frank soon before her wedding to Frank's brother Larry, and she enjoyed the experience so much that she will do anything to get Frank restored to vaguely human-looking life.  Larry's daughter Kirsty, played by Ashley Laurence in her motion picture debut, discovers what is going on and manages to get her hands on the puzzle box.  When she is introduced to the Cenobites, the fun truly begins.  <p>The Hellraiser series degraded into a sad mimicry of itself in later movies, but the original vision personally sculpted by the masterly hands of writer and director Clive Barker is a horror masterpiece.  The Cenobites are one of the most unusual, fascinating "bad guys" ever dreamed up in the imagination of man.  They really don't appear too often in this film, and Pinhead (played by the great Doug Bradley) is never referred to by this name even in the credits.  When they do appear, with Pinhead enunciating such great statements as "No tears, please.  It is just a waste of good suffering" and "We will tear your soul apart," they are truly horrifying, mysterious, and larger than life.  Less is definitely more when it comes to the prominence of Pinhead and his demonic associates in the movie.  <p>Those who dislike horror probably have sense enough to stay clear of Hellraiser.  Those of us who revel in extreme horror delight in watching it.  If you are an intermediate-level horror fan initiated by the Scream and Freddy/Michael/Jason movies, here is your chance to really test your horror mettle.</p></body></html>

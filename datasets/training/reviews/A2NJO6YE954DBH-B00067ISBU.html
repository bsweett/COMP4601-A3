That means I was free of any and all preconceptions regarding characters, casting, and plot this time around, unlike previous experiences with Batman, Spider-Man, and the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  But even from a tabula rassa perspective it is hard to believe that anybody other than Ron Perlman could have played the title role in &quot;Hellboy.&quot;  <p>The first key point about this movie is that &quot;Hellboy&quot; works even before Perlman shows up as Big Red and takes over the movie.  We begin in 1944 in Scotland, where a bunch of Nazis have shown up in order to open an inter-dimensional portal to the dark side and summon forth the Seven Gods of Chaos.  True, this is going to end the world, which is probably a bit more than Hitler was bargaining for, but it seems that the original Russian mad monk Grigori Rasputin (Karel Roden), his Aryan bride of death Ilsa (Bridget Hodson), and the blade loving Nazi psycho Kroenen (Ladislav Beran) have a slightly different agenda.  Fortunately, young Professor Trevor Broom (Kevin Trainor), FDR's psychic advisor, and the U.S. Army stop the Nazi plot.  The portal is closed, but not before a little red-skinned horned demon comes through from the other side.  <p>We jump ahead to the present, where the rumored sightings of Hellboy are a tabloid staple.  Young clean-cut F.B.I. agent John Myers (Rupert Evans) becomes a part of the agency's Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense where Professor Broom (John Hurt) introduces him to &quot;Abe&quot; Sapien (Doug Jones does the acting but the voice is provided by David Hyde Pierce), a fish like mind-reader/psychic and the adult Hellboy in all of his glory.  Meanwhile, sixty years later Rasputin and his sidekicks are back again and have managed to unleash a monster from inside a statue at the museum.  The fun part about this particular monster is that every time you kill one, two more are born to take its place.  Hellboy has his work cut out for him this time, but Rasputin and Kroenen do something that makes this really personal for our hero.<p>But the ending of the world as we know it is a minor problem compared to Hellboy's love life, which is fixated on the melancholy Liz Sherman (Selma Blair).  She is a pyrokineticist who bursts into flames when she gets excited or angry.  He is a seven-foot red skinned demon from another dimension who is impervious to fire, so it is clearly a perfect match.  But once John convinces Liz to come back to the fold they start spending time together, forcing Hellboy to sneak around on rooftops spying on them.  However, this is all just a prelude to the final showdown with the bad guys and their monsters.  More than any other comic book superhero on the big screen, Hellboy really takes a pounding.  But the big guy keeps coming back for more.<p>Perlman is pitch perfect as Hellboy, his baritone voice providing depth to the character beyond the awesome makeup job.  Working from Mike Mignola's Dark Horse comic books, director Guillermo del Toro (&quot;Blade II&quot;) creates a suitable gothic atmosphere for Hellboy to have his knockdown drag out battles.  But the star here is Perlman's Hellboy.  This is pitch-perfect casting and Perlman is even better here than he was as Vincent on television's &quot;Beauty and the Beast.&quot;  If anything, he is bigger and better than the movie he is in, which is a pretty good accomplishment for a comic book movie.  This guy watches out for kittens during a fight.  What is not to love about Hellboy?</p></body></html>

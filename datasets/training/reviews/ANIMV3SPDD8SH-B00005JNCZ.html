It's ditched about a quarter way through the film, a 1939 Norton 500 classic called "The Mighty One".The black sputtering sleek machine, bleeding oil and begging another mile possessed a lot more rebel spirit than Che Guevara (Gael Garcia Bernal), the legendary revolutionary depicted here in this autobiographical story as a reserved young man with the budding awareness of social injustice in 1950's South America. He's a good hearted humanist and unfortunately, aside from the glare of his sympathetic heart, we never do learn what makes this infamous historical figure tick. We know he'd give you the shirt off his back, give away his last money to the needy, question the ideology of Christian missionaries swapping needed food for sermon, but when he's asked by a budding novelist to critique the work, his brutal honesty and derogative comments are treated with the reserve of noble causes as if we're to understand he's painfully truthful as well. Here Gael Garcia Bernal, more so than in Pedro Almodovar's gay oriented "Bad Education", is a bit of a real drag. "The Motorcycle Diaries" brings no face to Che Guevara. It's just a point by point filming of his writing where issues of urgency; the selfish provincialism of South American countries, the overwhelming of ingenuous peoples, are merely chapter headings in what amounts to a feeble character study. But I liked the bike. I liked the South American history and scenery. I liked his riding partner's (Rodrigo De la Serna) snaky dancing. And anyone who tops a wild three month vacation off with a visit to a leper colony already has my attention.</p></body></html>

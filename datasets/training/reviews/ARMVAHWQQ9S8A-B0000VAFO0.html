<meta name="summary" content="Visually Beautiful, with a Flawed Plot"></head><body><p>Visually, this movie is perfection.  The crisp clearness of the movie is the high point of "Underworld", as well as Kate Beckinsale as vampire "death-dealer" Selene.  Dark, vivid, and brooding, the imagery in this film is top notch.  The story was good as well, though--unlike the imagery--was flawed.<br /><br />Selene is a believable character, and I rooted for her throughout the film.  The world she's thrown into is interesting, as well as intriguing.  Even the werewolf/vampire rivalry is riveting.  However, how is Master Vampire Victor allowed to be a Master Vampire is his powers hardly rival a more recently-sired Vampire?  I have to add though, that Bill Nighy did a stupendous job as Victor, using his menacing, calculated voice.<br /><br />Back to the grips: Why do some vampires/werewolves die by regular gunshots, but some just pull them out of their chest and get back up?  Why do some vampire need to be hit with ultra-violet bullets, but some just--again--die by regular gunshots?  A lot of plot devices thrown in the movie simply don't make sense with the world the writers and directors have established but it is an all in all enjoyable movie.<br /><br />Oh, and before I bow out.  One more problem.  In the beginning, this is said by Selene: "Our war has waged for centuries, unseen by human eyes. But all that is about to change."  Nothing to that effect happens.  A few humans are killed, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Just another inconsistency.<br /><br />8/10</p></body></html>

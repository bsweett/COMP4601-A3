<meta name="summary" content="A Great Stephen King Movie As Always"></head><body><p>&quot;Carrie&quot; is a monumental film released in 1976 that was so fresh for its time that many rushed to the theater to see it.  This is based on the first novel published by Stephen King in 1974.  When it was released, no other author had touched such territories in a such unique style.  The unusual theme kept people curious to what he would write next.  He immediately became a celebrity.  Such uniqueness remains fresh today.  &quot;Carrie&quot; is also the first film adaptation of one of his novels.  It earned two Oscar nominations: Best Actress (Sissy Spacek) and Best Supporting Actress (Piper Laurie).<p>This brilliant plot of a high school student, Carrie White, continues growing more interesting moment after moment.  The mystery and the suspense builds as Carrie slowly discovers and understands her supernatural powers.  Once she learns that it has a name, telekenesis, they begin growning more destructively.  However, the emotional aspect remains present, namely through the bullying and being emotionally tortured by her abusive religious mother.  The chain of events keep audiences watching closely up to the chilling conclusion.  The haunting conclusion has since become famous like the shower scene in &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960).  Her rampage has since been imitated by several films, but none have matched the intensity of &quot;Carrie&quot;.  Such tremendous film quality goes beyond Carrie's humilating moment of having pig's blood dumped on her by some bully pranksters during her senior prom.  <p>The physical surroundings and the performance enhance the eerie theme.  The house decorations enhance the good vs. evil aspect, going beyond the multiple crosses.  They give the supernatural plot portions a deeper horror feel.  Though all the actors performed their roles well, Spacek and Laurie stand out.  Spacek expresses her tortures splendidly, giving audiences the powerful aspect.  This is the film that placed her in much higher acting territory.  Laurie's performance alone made the telekenesis theme more scary.  <p>&quot;Carrie&quot; is a great film for those looking for a great horror classic.  It's sure to please audiences for many more years.  However, it's sequel &quot;The Rage: Carrie 2&quot;, not based on a Stephen King novel, is not as great as the original though worth watching once.</p></body></html>

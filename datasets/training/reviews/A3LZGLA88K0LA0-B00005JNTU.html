Never having read the comic book, I found the exposition necessary and handled quite effectively, with a great climax and some nice action set pieces beforehand.  While not Oscar worthy performances, the cast filled out their roles nicely:  Ioan Guffold is the analytical Reed; Jessica Alba a sultry Susan Storm; Chris Evans a buff and egocentric Torch; and Emmy winner Michael Chiklis a sympathetic Thing.  Julian McMahon did a nice underplayed villain in Doom.  While not as well done as the Spidermen or X-Men movies, FANTASTIC FOUR entertained me and looks like a sequel is coming.  Fun.</p></body></html>

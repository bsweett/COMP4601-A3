<meta name="summary" content="An intriguing premise sets this one apart"></head><body><p>I could talk a lot about the stuff I like about "Total Recall" - the dynamite special effects, production design and action, the numerous Schwarzenegger one-liners ("Consider that a divorce" is my favorite), and the colorful supporting characters. And what's not to love about a movie that gives us midget hookers on Mars?<p>But that kind of stuff is de rigeur for "Ahnuld" films; what really sets this apart is clever, mind-bending premise that director Paul Verhoeven chooses never answers: was this all "real," or just an implanted memory? Was Schwarzenenegger's character, Doug Quaid, really a secret agent, or was this just an "ego trip," an implanted memory that looks and feels real?<p>There's an intriguing sequence about halfway through the movie in which Quaid is confronted by a doctor from Rekall, the company that sold Quaid his "secret agent on Mars" fantasy. The doctor, accompanied with his wife (Sharon Stone), tries to convince Quaid that his experiences aren't real at all, but part of the fantasy Rekall sold him; unless Quaid comes back to reality (by taking a pill), he'll end up a mindless zombie.<p>Of course, in Quaid's fantasy (or reality?), his wife has already tried to kill him, so he's not listening too closely to what she says. But for a moment, Quaid is buying what the doctor has to say...until he sees him sweating, and shoots him in the head. The logic, of course, is that if the doctor is make-believe, he wouldn't be under enough stress to sweat. However, who's to say that's not part of the fantasy?<p>A movie with less intelligence would have answered these sorts of questions, and given the audience a pat "wrap up" sequence to tie up all the loose ends. But give tons of credit to "Total Recall": in the best sci-fi tradition, it's up to the audience to figure it out what really happened.<p>Along the way, we're treated to a spectacular vision of a future Mars, populated by human colonists and mutants (including a three-breasted prostitute who'd probably make a fortune in Las Vegas). There's a red-light district ("Venusville"), which is apparently to the future what Amsterdam or Bangkok are to today's tourists: a sex destination. You can get a "Mars Today" newspaper, or check into the Hilton.<p>Verhoeven is a master of these movies, in which the future isn't quite "Blade Runner," but fairly well warped. Things we take for granted today, like commercials, mass transit, or vacations, still exist, even though they've morphed slightly. This is a world we can all recognize and relate to. <p>Of course, all is not well on Mars, as the planet's governor, Cohagen (Ronnie Cox) is charging the good citizens of the planet too much for air, and is trying to quell a rebellion. Quaid goes to Mars thinking he might have fought alongside the rebels against Cohagen, but finds out that he might have actually been working for Cohagen all along.<p>Before too long, Quaid discovers Cohagen's secret: there's a huge, alien-built machine that will melt massive underground ice deposits, and create a breathable atmosphere on Mars. If Mars has an atmosphere, Cohagen loses his power over the people - their air supply. <p>How does Quaid learn all this? He encounters a mutant who pops out of a seemingly normal person's belly, reads Quaid's thoughts, and shows him the truth. Of course, this is after we meet the three-breasted prostitute, so by this point, we're not surprised.<p>The wind-up, in which Quaid gives Mars its' atmosphere, is about as fanciful as you'd please - one wonders exactly how the oxygen content on the planet become sufficient in five minutes - but it ties into the whole "is it real or is it a fantasy" premise.<p>After all, the name of the fantasy Quaid selects at Rekall is "Blue Sky On Mars."<p>Is it for real, or is Quaid sitting in a machine imagining all this, and having his brain warped as the doctor said?<p>You decide. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kate Beckinsale alone is worth the whole movie!!!"></head><body><p>Man, this woman is simply gorgeous!!! And gorgeous in a natural, simple way, and not a silicon-Botox-fake blond way. But that would be useless if she could not act. But she can, and Underworld was the perfect example to demonstrate it (unlike that awful thing called "Pearl Harbor"). She took a simple but complex role, and made the best of it, not overacting, not becoming a cliche, but giving the character a lot of "fuel" (Carrie Ann-Moss should have learned from her when she played "TRINITY" in both sequences of MATRIX...)<br /><br />And, sometimes, I just don't understand critics. This movie received a lot of backlash. Sue, it's far away from perfect, but critics are always complaining of brainless action flicks, with no substance (Bruckheimer-kind of movies)... UNERWORLD is nothing liek that. It constructs its history slowly and carefully, until reaching its climax.</p></body></html>

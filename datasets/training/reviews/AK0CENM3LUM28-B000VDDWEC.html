I love zombie movies but am easily frightened, so 28 Days Later definitely scared me on several levels. However, I can see how many people would consider this to be less of a scary horror movie and more of a suspense movie. Either way, I think the film works well.<br /><br />The film opens at a research facility where a group of well-meaning but ill-fated students are breaking in to free the laboratory animal test subjects. The animals are infected with a "Rage Virus" that makes them, well, the Rage virus basically turns you into a very fast, very angry zombie - an unthinking, unfeeling automaton purely motivated by a thirst to eat and kill everything not infected. Unlike the usual zombie set-up, the infected humans don't seem to be *undead* per se, and would presumably bleed to death under the right circumstances, but they don't really seem to be totally human either, given that they don't seem to suffer from some of the same limitations as humans and they (apparently) aren't driven to attack one another.<br /><br />The ill-fated students are, of course, infected by the test animals, and the virus immediately spreads throughout England with frightening speed. We black out and join our hero (Murphy) who is waking up from a coma that began prior to the outbreak. He stumbles bewildered through the now-silent streets, almost seeming to sleep-walk through the surreal quiet. And when he finally learns what has happened, that everyone he has ever known and loved is either dead or infected, his sense of loss is palpable. This terrible dilemma - would it have been better to live through the crisis as it unfolded or to just be hit with the finality of it after the fact? - haunts him and his companions as they scramble, terrified, through the streets hoping for a safe place, with food, with water, with some semblance of normalcy.<br /><br />When the few survivors tune into an automated radio message promising a cure for the infection, they are forced to make a choice. Their supplies are rapidly dwindling, but they are for the moment safe. They have no guarantee that the automated message isn't a hoax or a false promise. Do they sacrifice their current safety for hope? And also, do they sacrifice themselves for each other in the name of family and friendship or is it truly "every man for himself" in this bleak world?<br /><br />The car journey to the radio message has an almost dream-like quality. Although they are in danger, the survivors are still overwhelmed by the beauty of the countryside and the simple pleasures of a preserved tin of peaches. The dream can't last, however, and when they are picked up and taken to safety by a group of soldiers being led by a rapidly-descending-into-madness commander, they are shocked to learn that the soldiers plan to "survive" the infection by holing up in their fortress and raping any women and children they can find in order to perpetuate the species and generally pass the time. And here we are presented with new dilemmas, not the least of which is whether a human foe can be more frightening and dangerous than a zombie foe.<br /><br />Although this is clearly not a "typical" zombie movie, I feel that it deserves notice for the daring new approach taken by the film makers, particularly the dreamy, dazed feeling of the post-coma scenes and car journey scenes. Particularly thought-provoking is the question of self-preservation versus group-responsibility, and I appreciate that no easy answers are thrown out here. And the treatment of morality within a post-apocalyptic world is handled superbly, with the understanding that humans can lose their humanity easily enough without needing any "Rage Virus" to facilitate their descent. 28 Days Later may not be your average horror flick, but it is definitely worth a look.<br /><br />This movie provides closed captions for the hearing impaired.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very good slasher, albeit with a stupid ending"></head><body><p>Man, the way some people talk about this film you'd think it was something more than just another slasher movie.  And the way some people wonder about the ending, man I think they're trying too hard.  It's just stupid and gratuitous and nonsensical, so don't worry about it too much.  Stupid though it it, I really don't think the twist ending ruins the movie.  Again, it's just a slasher movie.  I don't care about these characters, so if the director eventually decides that, NOTHING IS HOW IT SEEMS, MUWHAHAHAHA!!!!, ehh, no big deal.<br /><br />Anyway, about all that needs be said about 'High Tension' is that it's a polished, efficient and rather brutal slasher movie.  We get to the killin in about 20 minutes, and it doesn't stop until the end.  Characters? I didn't notice any. Ms. Protagonist had an irritating lesbian haircut, and the killer was rather chunky and menacing.  Didn't notice too much else. Again, no big deal.<br /><br />Like I said, it's pretty much just one endless horror scene after the first 20 minutes.  Frankly, it isn't all that tense, as most of the characters get wasted pretty quickly, but it is quite an INtense film, which is just about as good.  It's not a gorefest, really, but it is one of the more brutally violent films I've ever seen.  Death is rarely clean and fast in 'High Tension', and they throw in a number of nasty little touches. (Such as how the killer kinda wrenches one victims head back after slitting her throat, and later when he drives an ax into another victims chest, and then stomps on their back while he's lying on the ground, to drive it further in.  ouch.)  That, and they finally let us see the gruesome potential of power tools in a horror film, which are often threatened, but rarely used to their full potential.  There's a very soggy sawing here which probably surpasses even the great jackhammer-impalation from 'The Church'. (Great movie, btw.  Check it out.)  They also up the intensity by *not* showing us some things, but simply letting us here the effects from someone else's perspective.  The gore effects, done by the legendary Gino de Rossi are of very high quality, even if they aren't quite as realistic as you'd see in a major release. (The unlikely decapitation ain't so convincing, but it's still pretty damn amusing, so it's no huge loss.)  Gino's technique has improved a lot over the years, though it's still recognizably him. (Like how much of the blood in this film is practically black, particularly when it is spewing/gushing.  The slit throat is totally vintage Gino, though, again, more convincing.)<br /><br />The acting is generally capable, if not remarkable.  The major exception is Phillippe Nahon, as the killer.  He's great, and is one of the most intimidating slashers I've ever seen.  He's basically a normal guy, but pretty big and bulky, and he squeezes an appropriate amount of barely controlled sadism into his actions.  He's not quite as effective at the end, where he becomes so messed up that he looks kinda like a bloody, demonic clown, but it ain't too big of a problem.<br /><br />Alexandre Aja probably didn't have much of a budget, but this is a great looking film.  Solidly atmospheric with lotsa smooth, controlled camera movements and some fairly artistic composition.  The DVD looks very nice as well, though as I've said before, I haven't a great eye for that sorta thing.  I've only seen the unrated cut, so I can't compare them, but it's hard to imagine why anyone watching a slasher movie would wanna see the less gruesome edition.  Keep in mind, this is a real unrated cut, meaning that this film actually did have to be cut in order to get the R rating.  So mainstream fans may find this excessively intense, and it's certainly way more brutal than any of the mainstream, American slasher movies that I've seen of late. (Actually, in terms of sheer volume this probably isn't much worse than 'Final Destination 2', but the violence here is a whole lot more serious, with little of the wackiness that pervades that film.)  Serious horror devotees certainly won't be shocked by this film, but it's still some pretty strong stuff.<br /><br />Anyway, it seems I've said little of significance, but I'm tired of rambling on.  Suffice to say, if you like slasher movies, you shouldn't hesitate to see this.  And don't worry about the stupid ending.  Just ignore it.<br /><br />Grade: B+</p></body></html>

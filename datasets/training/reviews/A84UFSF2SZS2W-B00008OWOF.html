<meta name="summary" content="GREAT PRETENDER"></head><body><p>I was surprised to find that this movie entertained me. Not that I was expecting it to be horrible, but I definitely was not expecting anything truly entertaining. I am not much of a Leonardo diCaprio fan, so I am skeptical anytime I see one of his films. However, he did very well in his role, and conveyed both the excitement and anxiety of being someone in his position (pretending and always on the run to be one step ahead of the law). Also appealing were Tom Hanks and the actors portraying diCaprio's parents, Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye.<p>A couple of things annoyed me though (because something inevitably does): 1. Jennifer Garner. I don't care how popular she becomes. I find her miserably annoying. 2. The strange and too long intro to the movie with stick figure drawings. It, oddly enough, practically tells the whole story... and as I said, goes on for too long.</p></body></html>

Macy are the "wild hogs" who are childhood friends going through mini life-crisis of their own. Ray Liotta also stars but he doesn't play one of the good guys, he steals this film as usual. This movie is pretty much a no-brainer but it's fun to watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon, check it out sometime!</p></body></html>

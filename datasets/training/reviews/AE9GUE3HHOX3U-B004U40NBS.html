She had the grand mal seizures of hallucionations!  It was fascinating to watch this film unfold and watch as Nina slowly slips into the grasps of insanity.  Everyone can relate to her on some level.  natalie Portman was fantastic and I feel that she deserved the oscar, hands down.  Winona Ryder was barely in the film but it was nice to see her acting again. I also enjoyed the perfromance by Mila Kunich.  Black Swan is a fantastic dark thriller with a great story and superb acting.</p></body></html>

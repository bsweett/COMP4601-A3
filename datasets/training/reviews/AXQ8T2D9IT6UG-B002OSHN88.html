That is, one of those few films everybody that loves well-made movies should watch at least once. Directed by Carold Reed, and based on a script written by Graham Green, this film has action and a mystery, but also some romance, and a beautiful cinematography that you cannot help but admire. In my opinion, this is simply the kind of movie you will not be able to forget, if you give yourself the opportunity of watching it.<br /><br />The story begins when a novelist without a dime, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), arrives to Vienna in search of a job his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) has promised him. Unfortunately, he learns from the police that Harry has died in dubious circumstances, and that he was involved in criminal activities. Refusing to believe that, Holly decides to investigate what really happened to Harry, in order to restore his reputation. But can knowledge be a dangerous commodity in post World War II Vienna?<br /><br />On the whole, I think you will love this splendid noir movie, and that you will be fully immersed in the mistery of "The third man" as soon as you begin watching it. What will happen to Holly Martins in his search of truth? And who was Harry Lime? Those are answers that you will only find in this film, not in this review. I can promise you something, though: you will not find it boring!<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></body></html>

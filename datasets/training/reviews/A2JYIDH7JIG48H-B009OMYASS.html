<meta name="summary" content="Lurid fun for horror cult fans, too sick for some."></head><body><p>I think some hardcore horror fans will be delighted with Hostel, but this movie isn't for everyone.  The first half is softcore porn, enough to push the envelope of an R-rating.  It's about 2 young American tourists, looking for loose women in Europe (they can't get any at home).  They check into a Hostel where they find their girls, but their friend disappears the next morning, followed shortly by one of the American boys.  It turns out they're being kidnapped by a torture-for-sick-pleasure ring.  The second half is lurid, gruesome, bloody torture along the line of Saw and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, enough to break the envelope - it might have needed an NC-17 rating.  I don't have any problem with that except that it is gratuitous violence for the sake of gruesome lurid violence itself, without any point, without any redeeming surprise twist at the end like in Saw.  You might be attracted to the film if you're a Quentin Tarantino fan, but as a whole the movie's not quite as good as some of his others.  And if you're a fan of objectionably pointless gruesome violence, you'll still find slightly better movies for that.  Personally I liked Saw and Final Destination somewhat more.  For the average movie viewer, it's not scary, just repulsive.  I'm not saying that to dis the movie, just to explain why I can't give it 4or 5 stars.  But I can imagine some horror fans will consider it a 5-star instant cult classic.  It is technically a well-made film, and perhaps redeemed by the possibility it can serve as a warning to young tourists travelling alone.</p></body></html>

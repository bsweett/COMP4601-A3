<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good movie"></head><body><p>I have to say I actually enjoy this movie.  Hugh Jackman did the movie really good in my viewpoint, plus Kate Beckinsale was very entertaining preformance as the princess.  It had enough plot line for a good movie, this movie basically ends up being a love it or hate it movie as I call certain movies.  It had enough chessy parts to make for a mindless entertainment value.  Just remeber to keep an open mind while watching certain movies, some might end up surpising you just like this movie did for me.  It was better then imagne it could have been.  Plus I enjoy certain horror movies anyways, and most live up to the hype.  So if you need a good laugh and some good speical effects then pick this movie up and enjoy some good lines and action scenes.  Then after watching it make up your own mind about if you like it or didn't like it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Truly Incredible. (Book 1: Part 2 )"></head><body><p>After the major success of 'Iron Man' and of course the special surprise that was revield to us at the end of the film, we were all eager for the next big Marvel hero movie. So In between the summer kickoff with 'Iron Man' and the heavily anticipated blockbuster 'The Dark Knight', Marvel decided to revive a hero who was brought to shame a few years earlier.<br /><br />'The Incredible Hulk' was a complete make-over from Ang Lee's monstorsity with a talaented cast (Well....not much to say about Liv Tyler) much better special effects and a deeper more emotional story. The film also paid tribute to the fan favorite television show as well as the comic book geeks who pretty much went to see the movie against their will. This movie left me satisfied again it was not the greatest movie I had ever seen but like 'Iron Man' the movie was fun and enjoyable. Of course with Marvel's big project that will be heading to theaters in the next few years the end of this film will also leave you with a smile on your face.</p></body></html>

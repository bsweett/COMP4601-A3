<meta name="summary" content="I haven't read the books, but loved the film"></head><body><p>I think I tried the books, but they are not my cup of tea. I agree that the movie's main plot is simplistic. However, it is the acting, the relationships, and the subplots that make this movie soar for me. I think Crowe does a great job. There is a good supporting caste. Crowe displays well the inner turmoil over the hard decisions he has to make that affect the life of his crew. The sea is itself a character in the movie. The images of daily life on the sea are compelling as well. The battle scenes are done well. The strategies and subterfuge the opposing captains play on each other are enjoyable. The strategies are simple ones like you would use in Stratego rather than chess, but still fun. The relationship between the doctor and the captain is interesting. The behind-the-scenes options on the DVD are interesting as well. In its genre, the movie holds up well to the classics.</p></body></html>

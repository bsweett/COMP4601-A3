<meta name="summary" content="King Kong: A Film of Indelible Images"></head><body><p>When film lovers discuss the merits of KING KONG, they often focus on the 'big' scenes, Kong on the Empire State Building, Kong bursting out of his shackles on stage in New York, Kong battling a series of prehistoric beasts on Skull Island.  KING KONG surely is deservedly known for these, but the movie's enduring power to enthrall each new generation of viewer is based on the movie's more subtle, yet equally mesmerizing lesser scenes, not all of which involve him.  What is astounding to a generation of contemporary audiences jaded by computer enhanced special effects is the way the movie has held up over the decades.  The stop-motion animation of Willis O'Brien shows a Kong as seamless as any computer could project today, and certainly as far superior to the 1976 King that groped Jessica Lange.  One of the reasons that this more recent Kong failed to resonate with modern audiences is that the somber, brooding mood of the original was reflected in the gauzy, hazy photography that showed the jungle of Skull Island to be every bit the Jurassic danger that Spielberg envisioned for his theme park. Repeated viewings of the sailors that slug their way through the jungle to find Ann Darrow emphasize the lurking monsters behind every tree and hill.  Directors Schoesdsack and Cooper (both of whom had bit parts as the pilot and machine gunner who shot Kong off the Empire State Building) would introduce each succeeding reptilian threat from a distance, almost lulling the sailors and the audience into a false security that the beast was not a threat.  But then, they would focus the camera on a twitch of the beast's head.  One could see and hear the beast sniff the air as a preparation to attack.  When it did attack, the assault came on like a runaway train.  Sometimes the guns of the sailors killed or drove it away, and sometimes they didn't.  It is this constant sense of menace that permeates Skull Island that serves as a prelude to meeting the King himself.  The sailors and natives saw Kong first, of course, when he grabbed Ann Darrow, but they had to experience the power of those outsized simian thews as Kong rolled them off the log into an unknown, dank horror below.  As many scenes of subtle, psychological power as there are on Skull Island there are an equal number in New York, a city which contains more deadly dragonflies than his home stomping grounds.  As one sees Kong rage over his abducted girlfriend both on Skull Island and in New York, one can see that Kong is not much more different from any guy who sees another dude swipe her.  His reaction each time is predictably violent.  As his violence increases, so does his ability to think rationally decrease.  Kong is a beast, sure, but he is a thinking, rational one who in the parlance of lawyers seeking to explain the murderous behavior of their clients, has 'lost it' since he was pushed beyond the limits of simian endurance.  But what elevates Kong beyond his more human killer counterparts is his inner sense of inherent nobility that comes out at crucial moments.  There is no doubt that he is a self-sacrificing creature who would unhesitatingly lay down his life for his mate.  He proves that on Skull Island and on the Empire State Building.  When Kong lays Ann down to face the swirling attack planes, he meets them as one king to another.  He beats his chest, roaring out his defiance, knowing full well that the power that overwhelmed the prehistoric beasts on Skull Island would fail him here.  For that brief moment, Kong transcends a beast out of his element.  The audience applauds a creature who in years to come would morph into John Wayne, Rocky, and every other hero worshipped by audiences in the theater with every bit of the fervor worshipped by the natives behind their huge wooden gate.  Kong was the king in every sense of the word in both his island in the Pacific and the island off the Atlantic.</p></body></html>

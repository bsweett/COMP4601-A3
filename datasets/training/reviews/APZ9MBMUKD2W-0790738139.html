<meta name="summary" content="A great trip to a foreign land (The Past)"></head><body><p>As someone who lives in LA, it was a flash to the past with this film. I can not recommend this film too much! Some films just seem to have the magic touch, where everything seems to push it toward excellence. The writing , photography, location selection, musical score, direction, the selection of the cast,the actors dedication in this film are top drawer. This film just shows what Hollywood could do but usually does'nt.<br /><br />This film I believe will stand the test of time as one of the great classics of film.</p></body></html>

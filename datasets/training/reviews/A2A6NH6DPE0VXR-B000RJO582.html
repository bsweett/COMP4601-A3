It's smart, scary, has some dark humor and the zombies are lively and scary. The zombies don't just walk around like dull dead-heads like in Resident Evil for example. Hell this move is everything that Resident Evil could've been.<br /><br />  Sarah Polly (Go!) plays a women who wakes up one morning with her husband and they both get attacked by the little girl nextdoor who became a zombie. Her husband gets bit and becomes one, so she flees her her house not knowing what is going on. After seeing the madness going on in the streets, she panicks and gets into a car accident. Then she meets a badass cop played by the...badass Vin Rhames (Pulp Fiction). They meet Mekhi Phifer (8-Mile, E.R.) and his pregnant g/f along with Jake Weber (The Cell). At the mall they meet some security guards head by C.J. (Mchael Kelly) who have claimed the mall there's and are relucant to let them stay there.<br /><br />  The cast is really good but surprisingly Michael  Kelly I think has the best part. . He handles the action scenes just as good as Rhames. Plus since his character has some screws loose and actually enjoys splattering zombie brains all over, it makes his character the most interesting and fun. This movie has some the best action since Aliens dare I say. I thought I've seen enough zombie movies of late but this makes me want to see a sequel get made. The movie is also smart and strange. Is clever how Vin Rhames communicates and becomes friends with a guy on top of a store roof by flashing signs back at each other and then use binoculars to see what each other say. Plus Mikhi Phifer's g/f giving birth has to be one of the strangest and unusual scenes you'll ever see. If anything is disapointing about the movie, it's how it just suddenly ends after so much action, thrills and blood splatter. However is some action during the credits but that  makes you want to see what happens next even more.</p></body></html>

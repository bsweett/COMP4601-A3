<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining, Good Pace, Satisfactory Acting...But The Ending Is The Kicker!!"></head><body><p>I rented this film today and enjoyed it...so I will defintely be getting it soon.<br />I found it to be very entertaining, well-paced, suspenseful, graphic in places.<br />Gerard Butler was like the devil in this! And with good reason, but his character<br />gets blinded by revenge. (Good job though!)<br />Jamie Foxx did a satisfactory job in this and the other cast was sufficient.<br />Lots of explosions, violence, and other manner of thrills & chills for those<br />who like that sort of thing...I can't complain about the film overall, but<br />the ending was very unexpected to me. I give it 5 stars for being a great entertaining<br />film that won't bore you and you can follow it all the way through.</p></body></html>

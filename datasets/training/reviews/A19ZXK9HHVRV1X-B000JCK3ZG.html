The latest installment, "X-Men: The Last Stand" takes the issue a step further by proposing a complex moral dilemma: should the "mutants" be encouraged to partake of a supposed "cure" for their condition or should they be proud of who they are and not change merely to placate a society made uncomfortable by their presence?<br /><br />Unfortunately, even though "The Last Stand" raises this intriguing ethical issue, it really doesn't do anything all that interesting with it.  The main problem is that the screenplay simply fails to come up with a character commensurate with the movie's theme.  In fact, there are so many mutants running around that none of them is ever able to grab the center of the movie's attention or the focus of the audience.  Storm, Wolverine, Phoenix, Iceman, Rogue etc. all have their individual moments but they are soon crushed under the weight of overblown actions scenes and over-the-top special effects.  Only Ian Holm's evil Magneto has a chance to break through all the pyrotechnics and create some impact as a character.<br /><br />I loved the original "X-Men" when it came out in 2003 precisely because it felt so bold and daring in its willingness to explore social issues along with all the CGI effects, stunt work and explosions that are par for the action film genre.  But the two follow-up editions have not lived up to those expectations.  I'm sorry to say that, despite all the technical fireworks of the grand finale, the "X-Men" series ends not with a bang but with a whimper.</p></body></html>

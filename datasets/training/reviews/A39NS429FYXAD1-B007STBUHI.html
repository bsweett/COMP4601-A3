The bonus features have some nifty moments, altho' no great revelations for afficiandoes.<br /><br />Definitely a must-own for film buffs; like you need an excuse to watch it again!<br /><br />My only regret is that there is no commentary track...  I can't believe with all this film gave to those involved that they didn't want to contribute more to the DVD than release the usual EPK interviews.  Too bad!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="OK REMAKE WITH NOVEL'S ENDING THIS TIME"></head><body><p>If a sense of deja vu hangs over RED DRAGON - Director's Edition, it's because producer Dino De Laurentis already made Manhunter, a 1989 version of Thomas Harris's brilliant best seller.  <p>This time around, Brett Ratner directs, and Anthony Hopkins is back as insane Dr. Lekter (without Sir Anthony, there's no real justification for this film). Baby faced Ed Norton is disappointing as the reluctant collaborator of Lekter in tracking the somewhat sympathetic &quot;Tooth Fairy&quot; killer wonderfully underplayed by Ralph Feinnes.  Ted Tally's lean screenplay includes the book's jolting finale, something the first film version strangely omitted.  <p>The loaded two disc edition has a featurette on FBI profiling and Ratner's interesting video diary (including a weird visit to the set by Michael Jackson). The unusually incisive commentary by Talley and Ratner is as interesting as the movie.</p></body></html>

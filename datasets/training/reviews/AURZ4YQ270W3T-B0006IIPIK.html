<meta name="summary" content="Visually brilliant with little emotional resonance"></head><body><p>"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is a visual treat, the kind of film that advances the visual state of the art, and it's a blast. But, as other films that also advanced the state of the art remind us  - "Fantastic Voyage," "Earthquake," "Logan's Run," "Tron," and even "Final Fantasy" come to mind - it takes more than cool visuals to make a truly great movie.<br /><br />What it takes is emotional resonance, and that's what "Sky Captain" lacks. Emotional resonance is the reason why films like "The Wizard of Oz," "Star Wars," and "Raiders of the Lost Ark"  - all of which are obvious influences here - are still great, even after the state of the visual art passed them by. In those classic films, the human element shines through the technology; in "Sky Captain," the humanity seems a bit lost.<br /><br />Not that "Sky Captain" doesn't try, with terrific actors, and some frequently fun and snappy dialogue. Perhaps it's no coincidence that the most recent "Star Wars" movies, which, like "Sky Captain," were all largely shot in front of green screens and had the environments "digitized," also don't make much of an emotional impact either. Perhaps actors are more "real" in a "real" environment.<br /><br />But "Sky Captain" has its moments, from the gorgeous rendition of 1930's New York, to wildly imaginitive visual elements like bombers with wings that flap like a bird's, to giant airships that serve as floating airbases. This is all truly visionary stuff, and it's executed with real panache, but it's done without making a real emotional connection with the audience.<br /><br />You have to give the director, Kerry Conran, props for visual originality, and for the way this film was brought to the big screen (hey, there's hope for all us frustrated filmmakers, I guess), and hope that his next effort will make that next great leap into a film with real emotional impact. Conran has that kind of film in him, if Hollywood will give him another shot.</p></body></html>

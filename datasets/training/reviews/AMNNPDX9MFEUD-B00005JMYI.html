<meta name="summary" content="Hilarious no matter how many times you see it"></head><body><p>This is a movie I could watch once a week and always laugh out loud (as well as always replay the dog over the bridge scene for extra laughs). There are more outrageously bizarre and side-splittingly funny moments in this movie than any I can think of, and after four plus decades on planet earth (you stay classy...), I've seen a lot. The entire cast is brilliant, the satire gleefully over-the-top, and the plot, well, are you really curious about a plot? Who cares? Check your prudishness at the door and get ready to choke on your popcorn and spit-take your beverage as this movie will make you laugh your breathtaking hiney off. This is one of those Caddyshack-type movies that will have you dropping lines from it and getting the knowing winks and follow-up lines from those who have seen it as well. It is the gift of laughter to get for yourself or those who have a sense of humor that does not involve gentle mews of joy but loud guffaws of bombastic pleasure. If you don't find at least a half dozen solid belly laughs in this movie, then I don't think I want to know what you find funny.<br />By the way, the special features are funny, too, and numerous. Good stuff all the way around. Get it, laugh, and make your world a funnier place.</p></body></html>

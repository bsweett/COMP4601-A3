<meta name="summary" content="This Movie's Sequel-"My Big Fat Greek Divorce!!!""></head><body><p>In this movie we see Toula  who is a good Greek girl but is almost 30 and still not married. Perhaps this is what Sophocles had in mind when he wrote about Greek Tragedies. Toula then falls in love with an Anglo Saxon American much to her family's dismay and horror. The irony in this film is while Toula spends her time trying not to be Greek her new fiance does everything he can to be Greek and accepted by her family. He even dumps his friend as Best Man in his Wedding because he is not Greek. I figure that after two years of eating souvlaki and taramosalata he will file for a Big Greek Divorce!!! If you enjoy seeing ethnic stereotypes played out on the big screen then this movie is for you.</p></body></html>

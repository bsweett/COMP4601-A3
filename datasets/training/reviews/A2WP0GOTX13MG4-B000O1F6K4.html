<meta name="summary" content="A Tangled Story"></head><body><p>'Once Upon a Time in Mexico' continues the story of El Mariachi, played by Antonio Banderas.  After the events of 'Desperado,' El Mariachi attempted to settle down with Carolina, played by Selma Hayek, but a ruthless Mexican general had other plans.  Having lost the love his life, El Mariachi retires to a mission where guitars are made until the henchmen of rogue CIA agent Sands, played by Johnny Depp come calling...<br /><br />This is one confusing tale.  There are multiple parties pulling the strings.  Agent Sands is encouraging a Mexican revolution, but he wants the leader in charge killed after the revolution is over.  The head of a Mexican Drug cartel, played by Wilem Dafoe, is funding the revolution, and trying to make himself disappear in the process.  The Mexican General is intent on sezing power in Mexico.  It takes careful attention to figure out how exactly the parties all fit together.<br /><br />Don't go looking for a lot of 'good guys' in this movie.  There are probably only two genuinely good guys:  El Mariachi and Jorge, a retired FBI agent.  Whether they are actually good guys is debatable.  Many of the characters evolve throughout the story, and a few even become likeable.<br /><br />If you are watching the movie to see Selma Hayek, don't bother.  Her role is minimal, and you find out that she is killed off before the events of the film even take place.  She frequently given second billing in this movie even though she has less screen time than a dozen other actors.  Still, she does have a memorable opening scene.<br /><br />Overall, I tempted to give this movie 3.5 stars.  However, I liked it more than three stars, and since 3.5 is not an option, I'll go with four.  I'd recommend it to anyone that liked 'Desperado,' but some of those fans are bound to be disappointed.  The movie is frequently confusing, often gory, and not for children.</p></body></html>

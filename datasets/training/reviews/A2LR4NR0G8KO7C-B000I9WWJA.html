<meta name="summary" content="Too many things at the same time"></head><body><p>With Inside Man Spike Lee certainly managed to disguise a regular bankjob story as a flashy accelerating action movie.<br />Nevertheless the result he came up with is still worth watching.<br />The New York police has trapped a small group of bankrobbers led by Clive Owen inside the bank they were trying to rob. Denzel Washington is in charge of the police squad sieging the bank. As time passes by he begins to realize, that the robbers aren't the type of criminals they pretend to be. Spike Lee is still a great director, but Inside Man clearly tries to be too many things at the same time. There a too many subplots in there , that could have easily been removed from the final cut. Shame though...because the cast is great...even Jodie Foster is fun to watch for a change. Normally she tends to play women that could burst out crying at any time.(SARR)</p></body></html>

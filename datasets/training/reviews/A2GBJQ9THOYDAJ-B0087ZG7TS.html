<meta name="summary" content="Very high level of accomplishment from a very young director"></head><body><p>To put it simply, this is an amazing film, wrenching, mesmerizing, beautiful, and painful, alternating poetry and brutality. It's a story of self-righteous misunderstanding and unreliable narration (on several levels), in which the events an overly impressionable young girl witnesses lead to the destruction of two lives -- three, if you count her own life. And, like the book, the ending, in which Briony, now on the verge of death, tells the interviewer the truth she couldn't quite tell in her novel (she's not really very brave), is upsetting and painful as well. There are no clean endings in real life. The screenplay is beautifully written, and extremely close to the novel -- closer than I would have thought possible, in fact. Keira Knightley is very good as Cecelia, though she doesn't really get a chance to emote in this role, Cecelia being a rather closed-off sort of person. James McAvoy nails the part of Robbie Hunter, unjustly imprisoned on Briony's testimony and the victim of class differences -- especially in the scenes in northern France, after the bitter years of imprisonment have taken their toll. But Saoirse Ronan turns in the best work in the film as the thirteen-year-old Briony. Romola Garai is pretty good, too, as Briony at eighteen, and Vanessa Redgrave is competent in her brief section as the aging Briony. I can't think of another film in which the same character at three widely different ages, played by three actresses, has been so well developed. There's even a considerable physical resemblance among them. This is a far from light-hearted romance, or even a standard war story, and you won't forget it for a long, long time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bollywood-Style Jukebox Musical Benefits from Streep and a Game Cast"></head><body><p>Let's face it. If Meryl Streep was cast in a Fruit of the Loom commercial, she would still be the standout piece of produce, lending conviction to a one-dimensional part others would easily dismiss as too superficial. That's the way to view this ebullient, featherweight 2008 confection based on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000031WEN">long-running jukebox musical</a> from the prolific songbook of 1970's super-pop group ABBA, all of which were written by bandmates Benny Andersson and Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus. Even though there is barely a part there, Streep throws herself into Donna like it was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0784011710">Sophie Zawistowski</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783240171">Karen Blixen</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J103PC">Miranda Priestly</a>. She also gets to perform the lioness' share of the over two dozen songs that drive the flimsy, derivative storyline over its 108-minute running time. If you've ever seen an underrated 1968 Gina Lollobrigida farce called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6302641934">Buona Sera Mrs Campbell</a>, you'll recognize the plot straight away since it pilfers the same basic idea.<br /><br />This time, we are focused on the upcoming nuptials for Sophie, the beautiful twenty-year-old daughter of Donna, a resourceful hippie-chick who runs a dilapidated inn on a stunning Greek island. To make the chronology work, the story, one can assume, is set sometime in the late 1990's as Donna apparently led a hedonistic lifestyle in the late 1970's when she became pregnant while fronting a girl-group called Donna and the Dynamos. This becomes pertinent because Sophie's paternity is a big question mark and is about to be answered because Sophie clandestinely invites the three men who could possibly be her father to her wedding - staid British banker Harry, adventurous Swedish travel writer Bill, and divorced architect Sam. The inevitable complications ensue when all three show up on the idyllic island, each coming to the conclusion that he is indeed Sophie's father. Meanwhile, Donna invites the Dynamos - now best-selling cookbook author Rosie and multiple-married, cosmetically altered Tanya.<br /><br />Add Sophie's intended, a hunky beach boy named Sky and his equally tanned and toned pals, as well as her two giggly bridesmaids and a rhythmic chorus of Greek villagers - and you indeed have a musical revue for anyone in the mood for one. At the same time, that's the caveat because you have to love ABBA's music to be enthralled by a movie riddled with flaws. The pacing often feels off, especially when characters belabor their individual dilemmas ad nauseam. Some of the choreography in the production numbers feels amateurish, and the cinematography frequently looks washed out (Streep looks particularly pasty and red-eyed in certain scenes). These lapses probably have to do with the arguable decision to have the Broadway crew of producer Judy Craymer, writer Catherine Johnson, and director Phyllida Lloyd translate all this to the screen, none of whom have any significant filmmaking experience. Perhaps a Rob Marshall could have lent a more polished sheen to the proceedings, but then again, there is a certain camp value that makes you wonder whether the whole venture is meant to be a parody of a good musical. Note the energetic "Dancing Queen" number which feels like a Bollywood production number with all the village women parading down to the dock in exaggerated unison.<br /><br />In the end, I guess it doesn't matter since a game cast has been recruited to make it all work at the intended level of fun. Streep shines without peer and sings with supple conviction on lighthearted ditties like the title tune and "Money, Money, Money", as well as the more emotive ballads like "Slipping Through My Fingers" and "The Winner Takes It All".  She can't help Pierce Brosnan who duets with her sounding like a wounded cow on "S.O.S." (The audience erupted in laughter whenever he sang). However, he regains some of his self-respect when he plays Sam straight-up. The other two actors - Stellan Skarsg?rd as Bill and the omnipresent Colin Firth as Harry - are also likeable though hardly challenged in their roles. Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya perform petty larceny in stealing their scenes, especially in their specialty numbers. As the hopeful Sophie, bright-eyed Amanda Seyfried is sweet without being cloying and has a bell-like voice which she shows off well on the bookend anthem, "I Have a Dream". The climactic wedding party scene is like watching news footage of Sydney's Mardi Gras festivities, while the end credits flash on a karaoke reprise of "Dancing Queen" complete in Vegas drag-queen regalia followed by a funny encore of "Waterloo" (my personal favorite in the ABBA songbook). Go at your own risk...you may love it.</p></body></html>

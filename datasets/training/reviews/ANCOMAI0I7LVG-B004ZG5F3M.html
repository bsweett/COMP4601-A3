<meta name="summary" content="Delicious and chocolaty sweet; a film that satisfies down to our creamy center..."></head><body><p>If ever there was a movie that was a delicious as its subject then `Chocolat' is that movie.  Making a movie about chocolate, the one guilty pleasure that transcends age, gender and race, is an idea in itself, but making that film creamy, sweet and pure is something all its own.  `Chocolat' tastes so incredibly sweet on the viewers palate, a film that coats our eyes with its rich goodness and makes us crave even more of what this beautiful film has to offer.<br /><br />Okay, enough with the obvious chocolate innuendoes.<br /><br />All kidding aside, `Chocolat' is a wonderful film, one that I never expected to like as much as I did.  My wife had seen the first part of this film some time ago and reported that it was horrible and thus she turned it off.  I must admit that the advertisements and posters for the film failed to draw me in (although after seeing the film and casting glance at the poster I can't see how Binoche's smile didn't draw me in at first glance) and so I accepted her complaint and tossed aside all aspirations of seeing the film even though my wife has significantly lower taste in film than I do and I generally reject any and all of her opinions on movies.  Now the other night, late at night I must add, this little film came on the food channel and I decided to watch it.  I only caught the first half hour before sleep overcame me but that first half hour was, in a word, spellbinding.  I insisted that my wife give it another try and so we rented to film the following day, and while she is not as intoxicated with this film as I am she readily admits that her initial response to this movie was wrong.<br /><br />The film centers around Vianne Rocher, a mysterious woman who moves to a reserved and very religious French town with her young daughter Anouk.  The town, about to observe Lent, immediately turn their backs to Vianne as she opens her chocolatier and tempts the townsfolk with all that they have vowed to abstain from.  No one opposes her more than the uptight mayor Comte Paul de Reynaud who comes to despise Vianne and everything she stands for.  He watches his power over the town slip from his grasp as they all begin consulting Vianne and falling prey so-to-speak to her chocolaty deliciousness.  Yes, Vianne is just as delectable as the chocolates she makes.  Her smile alone is intoxicating.<br /><br />The film is lovely to look for the cinematography is marvelous.  The acting is brilliant as well, from Binoche's devilishly sweet performance to Judi Dench's crotchety Armande Voizin to Alfred Molina's malicious Comte and Lena Olin's mysteriously beautiful Josephine.  Everyone involved here delves into their characters and delivers beautifully.  Johnny Depp has a very small role although it may seem from advertisements that his role would be larger.  He's effective but no where near as memorable as the remaining cast.  Carrie-Anne Moss delivers a nice little performance here as Armande's cold hearted daughter and young Victoire Thivisol manages to make Anouk a real girl, immature and foolish yet with a sense of maturity that would accompany her situation.<br /><br />I don't know if this would be constituted a spoiler, but I wanted to talk a bit about Pantoufle since I feel he is really the moral center of the film.  When the film opens we are introduced to Pantoufle, Anouk's imaginary friend kangaroo.  He is wounded and cannot leave her side.  At the end of the film Pantoufle is healed and bounces away from the town, and Anouk is happy for this.  Throughout the film mention is made of the fact Vianne moves around a lot and she even mentions herself that while she tells herself it's good for Anouk she knows in her heart that Anouk hates it.  To me Pantoufle was a metaphor for this very fact.  Anouk longed to stay put, thus the fact that Pantoufle could not leave her side.  He was wounded and thus could not travel.  She wished that she too could not travel but could experience some stability.  When she finally receives that stability at the films end she has no use for Pantoufle anymore for she has what she wants and so her subconscious sets him free.<br /><br />So, in the end I must say that I LOVED this movie, truly adored it.  It made me smile and rarely do films do that.  Maybe that's because I often seek out the film that depresses and saddens me because I enjoy the emotional connection to cinema, but it's nice to watch something that brings a smile and sense of joy to the soul, and `Chocolat' does just that.</p></body></html>

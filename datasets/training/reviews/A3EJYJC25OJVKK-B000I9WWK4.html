<meta name="summary" content="Nothing short of terrifying and brilliant all wrapped up into one!"></head><body><p>Unfortunately completely overshadowed by it's far lighter, and good-natured counterpart "E.T.:Extraterrestrial" which came out two weeks earlier, John Carpenter's "The Thing" couldn't have been more removed from E.T.<br /><br /> Set in Antarctica during the onset of the southern hemisphere's winter, a team of scientists stumble upon a group of Norwegian men who are shooting at a dog near their base. With the attempt thwarted, the scientists discover a ghastly enemy in their midst. It is an alien lifeform that copies the physical nature of the host it assimilates, albeit in a graphic and messy fashion. The alien's true form is never seen due to it's nature to hide in it's host, and mimic the thought and memory patterns as well.<br /><br /> Now they must be able to prevent this lifeform from escaping into the rest of the world but at the same time, it's ferocious nature makes it impossible to know if it's host is infected or not.<br /><br /> "The Thing" is among the scariest and most graphically bloody movies that I've ever seen but it's plot is marvelously written. A shame it was overshadowed by it's much more  successful counterpart "E.T.".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Feels Just Like a Graphic Novel"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed watching Sin City. It is just like the Graphic Novels came to life. The special effects are wonderful.<br /><br />This movie surely stands out in the crowd. No other movie that I can think of has looked this way.<br /><br />The movie is made for the comic book crowd, and stays true to form.<br /><br />Some of the blood and guts got to me alittle, and I had to shut my eyes. But still a good flick.</p></body></html>

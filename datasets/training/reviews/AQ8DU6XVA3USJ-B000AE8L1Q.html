<meta name="summary" content="The Downside of a Flawed Premise"></head><body><p>Despite great performances, this film is a dismal portrait of an unlikable character. We are told that Terry's husband has gone to Sweden with his secretary, and that for 3 years, never contacted his family (wife and 4 teenage to adult girls). We are told that Terry was "sweet" before this event, and has changed. What we see is a manipulative control freak with a bad drinking habit, and one must suspect that the seeds of this were always there.<br /><br />I find the biggest flaw is the basic premise of the film, which I can't mention because it would be a spoiler. I had a nagging feeling throughout the film that something didn't make sense, and in reflecting on the story after seeing the film, I realized that I had been duped, and that the very clever twist ending was a actually a silly one. There would have been too many unanswered questions for the plot to unfold as it does.<br /><br />Joan Allen is superb as Terry, but it is hard to have sympathy for her, even though she asks for compassion in her time of need. Kevin Costner is also excellent as Denny Davies, Terry's booze buddy turned lover, an ex-baseball star with a radio talk show, and a beer for breakfast type of guy. Yes, the liquor runs like a river in this film, but the dialogue is often weak, and many scenes seem unresolved. As the daughters, Erika Christensen, Evan Rachel Wood, Alicia Witt and Keri Russell all do their parts beautifully.<br /><br />"The Upside of Anger" was written and directed by Mike Binder, who also plays Shep, Denny's producer. Shep is a bit of a reprobate, but gives Terry an earful of truth at a wedding party, and has some of the best scenes in the film. The score by Alexander Desplat is lovely with some nostalgic songs included, like Neil Diamond's "Girl, You'll Be a Woman Now." DVD extras include deleted scenes, and commentary. Total running time is 118 minutes.<br /><br />SEMI-SPOILER:<br />We all have favorite things. Things we use daily and wouldn't like to live without. If I ever "disappeared," I would hope that the family I had been living with for nearly 2 decades would notice if for instance, my journal and favorite pen had not "disappeared" with me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A solid and entertaining thrill-ride of a movie"></head><body><p>Matt Damon is Jason Bourne - an agent of the U.S. government who has lost his memory, yet retains a great deal of intelligence and martial arts skills.  The CIA believes he has failed a mission he was sent to accomplish in Europe.  When they learn he is alive, they quickly use a league of agents to hunt down Bourne before time runs out on the clock, and the men involved with the screw up get in real trouble.  The plot gets very detailed throughout the film, but this is the basic idea.<br /><br />Though there are some nice fight scenes and a great car chase in the film, the plot is always moving along, so there is little need for an abundance of action to keep things rolling.  I love films like this, cause when there is action, it actually holds some meaning when it occurs.  Bourne and the woman he accompanies (who the CIA is also after) share a great chemistry - both as characters and as actors.  The remainder of the cast is solid, and includes stars such as Julia Styles and Clive Owen - both who actually player lesser characters in the film, though nice to see.<br /><br />Best thing about this film is the non-stop running of Bourne.  He rarely gets time to stop for a breather, therefore making this film a very easy one for the viewer to stay alert to.  There is a detailed plot that takes a lot to follow every step of what's going on, but it is just as easy to watch if you prefer to sit back and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Compared to James Bond in a sense, Bourne actually feels much more realistic.  While Bond is more fun and action packed in the long run, Bourne gives us a greater taste of reality.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 4<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4</p></body></html>

And in the world of "Equilibrium", it's gone - not just the 'negative' emotions but all emotion and feeling - love, passion, joy, compassion, conscience - banned and supressed by the mandatory administering of emotion-blocking drugs.  A class of law enforcement officers known as 'clerics' are charged with tracking down and destroying books, films, works of music, paintings, 'interactive computer programs' and all other works from the past that are deemed to have the potential to trigger emotion.  These are designated 'Emotional Content' (abbreviated EC-10, in an apparent dig at the alphanumerical ratings - 'PG-13', '16-UP', NC-17', 'M', etc. - that currently adorn movies, CDs, video games, etc. and that will probably be applied to novels, groceries, and a host of other products in the near future) and they still exist in fair abundance in the ruined areas outside of the world's cities, and sometimes carefully hidden away inside the cities as well.  Outside the cities is also a refuge for a number of people who've fled the ultra-regimented society in order to avoid being forced to take the drugs which block emotion.<br /><br />  Through a series of events - some of which is brilliantly left open to interpretation to distinguish between coincidence and sub-concsious intent - a cleric named John Preston (Christian Bale) ends up missing doses of the emotion-suppressant and quickly beginning to feel again; and with it, to question: another taboo in this future world.  Preston is to end up being a key player in the simmering war between ultimate authoritarianism and free emotion.<br /><br />  The action is tremendous; sort of Matrix-styled but actually outdoing it; and very impressively the movie actually shows how the system of seemingly impossible fighting used by the clerics was developed through enormous computer analysis and simulation applied to the machine-like properties of an emotionless human mind.  The whole movie is eerily believable, with the possible exception of some aspects of certain events toward the end - not that they happen, but more the way they happen.  The ideas behind "Equilibrium", though, feel amazingly plausible all the way through.</p></body></html>

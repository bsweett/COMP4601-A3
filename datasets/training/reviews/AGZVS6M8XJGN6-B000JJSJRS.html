<meta name="summary" content="An enjoyable film that got action, comedy and a love story..."></head><body><p>Dwayne Johnson plays a natural-born hero called Mathayus... He starts off as an Akkadian mercenary crossing the ancient lands looking for his brother who is slain before his blazing eyes by a Nordic barbarian horde whose name is Memnon...<br /><br />What has kept the vicious tyrant as the absolute conqueror of the land is the fact that he has a visionary sorceress by his side who knows when he should attack his enemies... Mathayus finds out that she's a sexy gorgeous woman who looks amazingly beautiful (Surely the audience is teased ceaselessly by her cleavage-revealing...). So Mathayus forgets his commission to kill her, and a kind of romance begins to flourish between the two as he tries to carry out his assignment...<br /><br />Kelly Hu plays Cassandra, the female sorcerer who had beauty, charisma, cleverness, and enigma... In the beginning of the film, we're not quite sure where she stands... But when she first sees Mathayus, she's interested in the well-mannered warrior who's strong, brave, loyal and sincere... She realizes that he might me the future king who can save her from her power-mad jailer...<br /><br />As the ruthless conqueror, Memnon (Steven Brand) has got all of the skills needed to attain global domination... He has also got the force and the will to accomplish it... The combination was pretty scary...<br /><br />Michael Clarke Duncan plays the fearsome Balthazar, the Nubian King, the strong ally of Mathayus...<br /><br />Chuck Russell's "The Scorpion King" is a visual feast, and an entertaining action film... It has sexy harem girls, poison arrows, quicksand, an army of red ants, black scorpions, cobras, explosions, and a lot of fun... So don't miss it!</p></body></html>

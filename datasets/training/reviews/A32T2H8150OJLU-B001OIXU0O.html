<meta name="summary" content="Great fun, great music, but with a few minor issues..."></head><body><p>Hmm...will you like this video?<br /><br />Here's a quiz:<br />1) Are you a fan of ABBA?<br />2) Do you like movie musicals?<br />3) Do you like romantic comedies?<br />4) Do you like Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard, and/or some combination thereof?<br /><br />Here are the results:<br />1) If you can't stand the music of ABBA, move on...skip this movie, do not buy, (also do not pass "GO" do not collect $200).<br />2) If you answered YES to question #1 and at least one of the other questions, add this DVD to your collection.  You will watch it occasionaly, and enjoy it thoroughly each time.<br />3) If you answered YES to at least two of the other questions, you MUST get this DVD.  You will love it, and you will most likely watch it repeatedly.<br /><br />I found this movie to be great fun!  ABBA was at their apex of popularity when I was in college, and hearing this music brought back fun memories.  I thought that the director, writers, choreographers, and sound engineers did a grand job of synchronizing the music, dance, and storyline.<br /><br />The setting for the film is exotic.  The storyline is interesting, and the acting is engaging and fun.  The singing is good for the most part, though my HS aged drama-choir kids seem to gain a sort of pleasure from mocking Pierce Brosnan's solos.  Granted, his solos are probably the weakest link in the show.  On the other hand, I loved it when Meryl Streep's character and her two best friends sang at her daughter's bachelorette party.<br /><br />The story is almost melodramatic, and the main characters pull off their roles well.  The music and dancing is fun, and if you enjoy that sort of thing, then you will definitely enjoy this show<br /><br />4 stars!  "Thank you for the music"!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Interesting premis, but a bit heavy on the graphic horror side for my tastes."></head><body><p>Note: This is a remake of the Charlton Heston film, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0BU">The Omega Man</a>.<br /><br />In 2009 a researcher develops a genetically modified virus that can cure cancer. Unfortunately, the virus undergoes its own mutations and becomes a lethal killer that wipes out 90% of Earth's population. 1% of the population is immune to the virus, and others, though not completely immune, are not killed, but undergo biological changes into light-hating, carnivorous semi-humans.<br /><br />By 2012 cities are being taken over by wildlife, and the human race is on the brink of extinction. Will Smith is Robert Neville, a US Army Colonel engaged in biomedical research that may produce a cure for the mutated virus. He lives alone in NYC which was ground zero for the mutated viral outbreak.<br /><br />Smith is free to roam the city by day, but has to barricade himself into his home each night. HIs only companion is his dog. Smith tries trial after trial, and as failure after failure racks up he slowly loses more of his grip on reality.<br /><br />This is a fine thriller, but I have to admit that the movie comes across as part suspense, and part horror, and I don't care for horror films.<br /><br />The movie's premis is engaging, and Smith does a good job pulling off his role. I even liked the ending.<br /><br />All in all this is a pretty good show, but not for kids!</p></body></html>

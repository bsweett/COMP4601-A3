In the Kurt Wimmer written and directed intense sci-fi thriller "Equilibrium" the society known as Libria suppresses the act of feeling in its inhabitants.  With the aid of a drug Prozium, which all citizens inject at regular intervals, all emotions and feelings are quashed.  A vast militaristic organization has been created to root out any undesirables that don't follow these societal tenets.  At the apex of the enforcement arm are the Gramatan clerics, a group of super martial arts practitioners.<br /><br />Christian Bale stars as John Preston the most highly ranked Cleric with unsurpassed fighting skills.  Pure of thought and uncompromising, Bale and his partner Errol Partridge, played by Sean Bean comb the nether regions outside the city for rebels and to destroy any artifacts that could promote emotion and feelings.  His unflagging loyalty to societal head, Father played by Sean Pertwee is shaken when he is forced to kill Bean who has committed an unspeakable sensory crime.<br /><br />Bale purposely avoids dosing himself with Prozium which clears his mind and allows him to reconsider the jaded mores of the society.  Working with an ambitious and suspicious new partner Brandt played by Taye Diggs, he secretly joins forces with the underground while appearing to stalk them, striving to topple the gonernment.<br /><br />The underrated "Equilibrium" plays like a cross between "Brave New World" and "The Matrix" and compares quite favorably with the later.  Impressive action sequences filled with incredible gunplay propels the film forward, creating an exhilarating viewing experience.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Lot to Think About"></head><body><p>Whether you agree with him or not filmmaker Michael Moore's Sicko gives its viewers lots to think about concerning the state of healthcare in the United States today. Moore makes the argumentthat we would all be better off with a system of socialized medicine in place.<br /><br />It is clear that there are problems with the private insurance system which maximizes its profits by denying coverage to the sick in this country. Working from this premise Moore contrasts the systems in place in Canada, France, England and Cuba to show that universal coverage is the answer.<br /><br />Moore has taken a lot of heat over his investigative methods and his ways of presenting information. The question as to whether this is true journalism or pure muckraking and Bush bashing is best left up to the individual viewer but hos film is a good source of material for the health care debate and on this point alone it is well worth watching.</p></body></html>

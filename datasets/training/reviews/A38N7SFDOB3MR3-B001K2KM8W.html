<meta name="summary" content="Good Movie,"></head><body><p>I enjoyed Pan's Labyrinth. having missed the movie in the theatre, I waited (and waited...) for the DVD release. Yesterday it came to my door, and I was satisfied.<br /><br />While the movie is enjoyable, and a must see, it was not nearly as violent as many reviews stated that it would be. Most prolific movie watchers will find little to wince at. Pan's Labyrinth was also not very scary, nor a thriller.<br /><br />I found the movie to be a bit slow, and thin when it came to the fantasy elements. Trailers make us think that "Pan" is a movie that is 90% fantasy scenes. In reality, fantasy elements eat up only about 5-10% of the runtime. Lastly, I found it hard to connect with the characters.<br /><br />Now, with all this said, I still liked the movie very much. the acting was top notch, and the film making wonderful. The score was a great addition as well. The subtitles can be tricky, especially if you are trying to munch on a movie snack, but halfway through the flick you forget they are there.<br /><br />I recommend seeing Pan's Lanyrinth, but not buying it until you watch it first. It is not a movie I can see myself purchasing, nor really passionately remembering 5 years down the road.</p></body></html>

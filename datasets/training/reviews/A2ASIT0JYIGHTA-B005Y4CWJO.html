<meta name="summary" content="Very original, holds up well"></head><body><p>Produced in 1987, Hellraiser was not only a much welcomed relief to the horror genre, but it was extremely original. <p>I watched it again in 2004, and despite it reeking of the 80's (hairdo's, fashions, some special effects), it still works and is quite clever.  Even the effects are very well done considering the year they were done.<p>The storyline is something I have not seen before and that's what makes it so special.  A genuinely creepy tale, that will make you look away on more than one occasion. A man takes possession of a special box that can open the doors of hell if not careful!  He is not careful and telling anymore would spoil this exciting tale.<p>A must own for horror fans.  The DVD sports a nicely cleaned up transfer.</p></body></html>

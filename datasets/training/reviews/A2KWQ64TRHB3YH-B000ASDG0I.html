<meta name="summary" content="Fun film based on a highly unlikely premise"></head><body><p>Some films and books are fun to watch and read even though the basic premise is unrealistic and even absurd. The viewer/reader needs to put logic aside. There is an old Yiddish proverb that applies, "one doesn't question stories." This doesn't mean "don't ask questions about it." In fact the opposite is true. One should question everything one sees and hears and never accept something based on faith. What it is addressing is the recognition that in stories, fables, myths, parables, and the like, the narrator is purposely basing his or her tale on an absurd notion that one should realize and never forget is absurd, but nevertheless not allow this fact to destroy or even minimize enjoying the work. All of this applies here for the basic premise that the spouses of a loving couple could not know that the other spouse is an assassin is highly unlikely.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Better Thriller than Most"></head><body><p>What separates Michael Mann's "Collateral" from most other crime thrillers is that you actually have characters that you enjoy and, more importantly, understand. To see Tom Cruise as an ice-in-his-blood hitman, which is way more than casting against type, is something to behold. And Jamie Foxx as an unwilling accomplice is superb. And Los Angeles, as an unwilling third character, is hypnotic. (The scene where three coyotes cross a main L.A. drag is almost artsy, but extremely effective, as it questions the distinction [or lack thereof] between civilization and wilderness.)<br /><br />I agree with most reviewers that some of coincidences are farfetched, and that the ending is a little too much like other thrillers, especially "Speed". Still, the movie held my attention thanks to the peppery dialogue between Cruise and Foxx. What disappointed me, besides the logistical leaps in the plot, were the "gimmes". Michael Mann's commentary was surprisingly uninteresting and the "special" features weren't so special. However, this is movie is a high-water mark in thrillers and an exceptional character study worth owning.</p></body></html>

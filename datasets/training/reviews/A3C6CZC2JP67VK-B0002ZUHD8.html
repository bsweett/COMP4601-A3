They all had Guinevere fall for Lancelot and vice versa with both of them betraying their loyalty to Arthur. Here you get a fresher Arthur story that was never told before. Lancelot obviously loves Guinevere but she loves Arthur and not him. He knows this and he never gets too close to her. He mostly just steals looks at her. In this film you know Lancelot is too loyal to Arthur to go with his feelings for Guinevere.<br /><br />The actors and characters are strong and they help the film be more engaging. Clive Owen is believable and sincere in the title role; the supporting cast, including Ray Winstone, Stellan Skarsgard, and Ioan Gruffudd, gives stellar performances. The battles are fantastic too. They're exiting and intense. The battle on ice is cool but in some ways the one in Merlin is better. The battle at the end is the most compelling and totally makes the movie though. The story itself could've used more work but still I admire the film-makers for trying to be original story wise. They could've just given us the same story we've seen many times before but they chose otherwise and it worked for me. It's not a fantasy and Merlin isn't this great magical wizard....he's this dirty wise warrior guy that lives in the forest lol. Plus Arthur never goes looking for the Holy Grail. The movie is about love, characters with real emotions, friendship and freedom. It's not a great movie<br /><br />In short, "King Arthur" is a much better film than it is being given credit for. Prepare to enjoy this film for what it is and you will be entertained. If you enjoy films like "Gladiator" and "Braveheart," then pick up this DVD! It's really good and it deserves to be seen.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Funny yet occasionally boring Ferrell vehicle"></head><body><p>Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby does a more than fine job of spoofing the world of NASCAR and its fans, and is a pretty funny vehicle for Will Ferrell as well.  Ferrell plays the top racer title character, whose lifestyle of fame and fortune get curtailed by the arrival of French racer Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen) who seeks to out race our hero.  John C. Reilly is here and in fine form as well as Ricky's best bud Cal Naughton Jr., and there are enjoyable turns from Michael Clarke Duncan, Amy Adams, Greg Germann, Molly Shannon, and a wonderful turn from the great Gary Cole as Ricky's father.  While Talladega Nights isn't bad one bit, there are moments of occasional boredom.  Compared to Anchorman, and to a lesser extent the more recent Semi-Pro, Talladega Nights doesn't have the laugh out loud moments that one may expect to find here.  Still though, the good definitely outweighs the bad, and the moments of NASCAR lampooning are worth the price of admission alone.</p></body></html>

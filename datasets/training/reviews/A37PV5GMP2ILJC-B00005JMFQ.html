<meta name="summary" content="The Perfect Stocking Stuffer"></head><body><p>This is the perfect Christmas gift to get any member of the group of free-loading moochers you call your friends.  It's the perfect excuse to have a movie night at THEIR house, and make them ante up some wine, cheese, grapes and lots of chocolate, then hunker down for an evening of cornball romantic comedy with a difference.<br /><br />Chances are, with Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman on show, you won't even notice that the storyline is hardly Pulitzer Prize material, but you do stand the chance of busting a seam when Hugh does his Footloose/Saturday Night Fever/Risky Business impression at Lot 10 Downing Street, and Bill Nighy makes like Robert Palmer for a video shoot of the worst ever chart topping Christmas song.  There's also the incomparable Rowan Atkinson, making like Mr.Bean at appropriately inopportune moments.<br /><br />In case you think it's all about the guys (it is - but one can't take sides) there's a brilliant performance by Emma Thompson, and also Laura Linney, who has the worst cell phone ring tone ever invented.  Keira Knightley is more "Bend It Like Beckham" than "Pirates of the Caribbean" in this one, feigning wide open surprise a little too often. She's cute though, even if I always get her mixed up with Natalie Portman, the Amidala girl.<br /><br />There are enough love stories and love disasters here to sink a luxury liner - and yes, there are "Titanic" references too.  Even though the couples are for the most part separate little stories, there's a connection running through the movie that really ties them all together.<br /><br />The music is great, the movie is funny, and your friends will have to entertain you at their expense - what more could you ask from a movie?  Did I mention it has Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman?<br /><br />Amanda Richards, November 17, 2004</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This movie is almost perfect."></head><body><p>At the beginning, I thought things were moving a tad slow, but by the time the ball got rolling, this movie started to really make me feel along with Paul's character.  He is a great actor in this.  I would rate this more like a 4.5.  The extras contain several things as well, which is always a good feature for DVD's.  This story is depressing to me, but it's really good.  I would certainly suggest a rental for this selection, I know for sure it is at least worth that.</p></body></html>

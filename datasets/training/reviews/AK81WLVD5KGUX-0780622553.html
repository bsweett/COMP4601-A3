That's the kind of movie it is.<p>It was somewhat unfairly eclipsed by the Wachowski Brothers' _The Matrix_. The latter is a great movie and one of my favorites, but I suspect the Wachowskis watched _Dark City_ while they were turning their storyboard into a screenplay.<p>I can't tell you much about this one without giving away things that you really need to see in the movie. I can tell you that Rufus Sewell is a poor schlub who wakes up one day in a bathtub and finds out he's suspected of being a serial killer; that Jennifer Connelly is deadpan-delightful as his wife; that William Hurt is suave and Chandleresque as the police investigator on the case; and that Kiefer Sutherland does remarkably well for being cast very much against type. And that's about it.<p>At a broad and general level, I can also tell you that the mood is extremely dark, the tension is nonstop (in part because of the creepy soundtrack), and it's spooky as all git-out. And it plays with the question 'What is real?' as thoroughly as any film you've ever seen.<p>It is, in short, an extended noir-SF/fantasy mood piece. If that sounds good to you, trust me when I say you'll like it. This one's a mind-bender that will give you nightmares.</p></body></html>

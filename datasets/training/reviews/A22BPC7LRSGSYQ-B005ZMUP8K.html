<meta name="summary" content="The first movie is better"></head><body><p>I saw Pirates Of The Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest (2006) at a drive-in back in July 2006.  The best part of that whole night was the awesome summer weather we had.  It was great sitting in the back of the car, eating hot dogs, candy, soft pretzels, drinking pop, etc. under a starry night sky.  As for the movie, well, I was somewhat disappointed.  This movie is not as good as the first movie, Pirates Of The Caribbean - The Curse Of The Black Pearl (2003).  It seems so different.  What I mean is that the story seemed rather thin while most of the emphasis was on the CGI effects.  I agree with another reviewer who pointed out that the movie came off as more of a marketing opportunity toward kids than a movie with a good and believable story.  A lot of what I saw seemed childish and unbelievable.  Johnny Depp's character seemed more cartoon-like in this movie.  It wasn't his fault, though.  The movie seemed rather "flat" overall and made my mind wander, even though there was a lot of action in it.  There was an EXCESSIVE amount of meaningless action.  Everything was OVERDONE in this movie.<br /><br />If you want to see the best movie of this series, see the first one.  Based on the reviews here on Amazon, it looks like the ratings of the movies in this series so far have gotten progressively worse.</p></body></html>

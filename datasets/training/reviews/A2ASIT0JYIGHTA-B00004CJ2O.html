<meta name="summary" content="Buy the Australian DVD version NOW!"></head><body><p>Just released this week on DVD in Australia is Friday the 13th (after a very long wait).  It has been  distributed by Warner Bros internationally.  That is a good thing because we ended up with the full uncut version, plus a 'Making of Documentary'.  The print transfer is pristine too - in fact, it is so clear you would think it was only filmed yesterday.  Only problem is, it is quite a boring movie.  I saw it years ago, and just wanted to own it to complete my horror DVD collection.  It isn't a patch on &quot;Halloween&quot;, although the scene at the end with the girl in the boat is brilliant.</p></body></html>

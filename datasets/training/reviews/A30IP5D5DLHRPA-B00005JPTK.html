<meta name="summary" content="Good Acting, Good Visuals, However..."></head><body><p>I Am Legend is one of the films I greatly anticipated for Winter 2007 and having just emerged from the theater I feel as though a great deal is needed.  Perhaps my hopes were just too high but let's look at this point by point.<br /><br />I Am Legend is roughly take 6 at the original novel of the same name.  The Omega Man is probably the most popular and, for fans of that movie and older generations, this will prove very disappointing as both films derive multiple themes from the book such as Sam the dog, a woman entering Neville's life, etc, etc.  "IAL" just was not unique enough to satisfy certain fans.  For the general audience, however, there are some redeeming qualities.<br /><br />The visual were very nice.  New York city was reproduced superbly if not used outright as several blocks were closed off for the filming; kudos.  The "monsters" were kind of freaky but I almost felt a humanistic touch to them as one seemed to express remorse for losing one of his kind (I thought she was his daughter or something) but it's not expanded on.<br /><br />The acting, which comprises almost solely on Will Smith, is superb.  I still am having trouble finding a movie Will Smith acted poorly in every movie he is in I think about seeing just on that basis.  He performs well as a man living almost entirely alone for several years but remains diligent in his tasks.<br /><br />The story had potential.  It deviated slightly from the book in terms of the ending but I think almost for the better.  I'm glad the directors took a different approach to the Twilight Zone-esque themes of vampires that the original book took.  DESPITE ALL THIS, the movie was TOO SHORT.  It was barely 90 minutes (I think) and sooo much more could've been explained, expanded upon or even made somewhat kewl.  The ending came too quick and very anti-climatic almost to the bewilderment of the audience.  They didn't even bother to explain how certain things came to be and that really bothered me.<br /><br />The story is similar to War of the Worlds only the movie didn't suck as much; too many holes, not enough time.  IAL could've easily been an epic but directors settled for a 90-minute money bagger and I'm quite disappointed.  The movie started out awesome but just fell short at the end.<br /><br />I will still buy this on DVD when it comes out but for theater goers I must give a warning that there are holes.  Also, THIS IS NOT A HORROR FILM.  Several people tried to ward me off due to "horror-elements."  This is not the case.  If anything, it is a thriller.  It is appropriate for most audiences although I wouldn't bring too young of kids.<br /><br />All in all, a B-.  Diss marks for lack of story and length.  It kills the movie.</p></body></html>

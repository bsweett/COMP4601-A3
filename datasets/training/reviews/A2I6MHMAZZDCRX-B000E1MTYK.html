He joins the Weasleys and Hermione (Emma Watson) at the Quidditch World Cup.  But what should have been a fun trip turns serious when the campground is destroyed and a giant skull shows above the area.  The skull is the sign of the evil Voldemort.<br /><br />All that gets forgotten when the trio return to school.  Hogwarts is playing host to the Tri-Wizard tournament.  One student each from three wizarding schools will be competing in a series of dangerous contests.<br /><br />But things start out weird when Harry's name is called as a fourth contestant.  He's three years younger then the rest of them, yet he still must compete and survive the competition.<br /><br />Meanwhile, there is yet another new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  Mad Eyed Moody (Brendan Gleeson) seems to have taken a particular interest in Harry.  Can his tips help Harry make it thought the contest?<br /><br />I first saw this movie in the theater and loved it.  I have since started reading the books and expected it to change my take on this movie.  After all, the movie takes a 740 page book and turns it into a two and a half hour movie.  You know they will be leaving stuff out.<br /><br />Actually, however, the movie works.  Yep, there were lots of things left out of the book, but they did a good job of covering the important plot points without losing those who haven't read the book.  That's impressive.<br /><br />Ironically, they did add some things for the movie.  The most noticeable is the first task.  While dangerous in the book, they made it much worse here.  That time could have been used for something else, but it does make for a dramatic scene.<br /><br />The only weak part is the ending.  It is so rushed that it doesn't make the emotional impact that it does in the book.  And it glosses over some of the things that made the ending of the book such a big cliffhanger.<br /><br />Once again, I must say that this is the best movie version of the book we could hope for.  If you view it on its own, you'll enjoy it.  And if you haven't read the book, you'll love it.</p></body></html>

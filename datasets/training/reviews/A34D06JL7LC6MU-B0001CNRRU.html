<meta name="summary" content="Incredible Film With Awesome Acting"></head><body><p>&quot;21 Grams&quot; is one of the best films of 2003 and has some of the best acting.The movie was nominated for two Academy Awards for<br />Best Actress:Naomi Watts &amp; Best Supporting Actor:Benicio Del Toro.Sean Penn probably would have gotten a nomination here if he hadn't won Best Actor for &quot;Mystic River&quot;.The movie is about three people.Paul Rivers (Penn),Cristina Peck (Watts),and<br />Jack Jordan (Del Toro).Paul is a terminally ill college professor in need of a heart transplant.Cristina is a housewife greiving the death of her husband and two daughters.While Jack is a born again convict who just made a big mistake.Through the story all of their lives are intertwined marvelously and sometimes confusingly.The movie is told in sequence but frequently goes out of sequence to show you stuff that will happen later in the movie.Everyone in the film gives some performances of their careers including Naomi Watts whose performance is unforgettable.One of the best films of 2003,go see<br />&quot;21 Grams&quot;.</p></body></html>

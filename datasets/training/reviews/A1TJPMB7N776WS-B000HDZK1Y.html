<meta name="summary" content="3 1/2 Stars: El Luchero"></head><body><p>After his terrific turn in "The School of Rock," I was sold on the film persona of Jack Black: he's an everyman with big dreams, a little talent to achieve them and he's in possession of a big, juicy humanity that encompasses and validates everyone with whom he comes in contact. Though this basic human-ness is dimmed in "King Kong," Black's charm shines through nonetheless.<br />In the ersatz "Nacho Libre," Black plays a cook in a Mexican Monastery with dreams of becoming a big-time professional wrestler not for personal gain but to earn money to help the orphans that live in the Monastery.<br />Director Jared Hess (the horrific "Napoleon Dynamite") pretty much points the camera and allows Black to be Black: and this is a good thing because there are several hilarious moments particularly when Nacho (Black) is in the wrestling ring with his mondo-bizarro partner, Esquelito (Skeleton played by Hector Jimenez) who steals most of the scenes that he is in by just being one of the stranger acting creations of recent years.<br />Though directed haphazardly by Hess and lacking cohesion,Black and Jimenez seem to be acting in one movie and Hess directing another, "Nacho Libre" is fun, better than average Summer fare and Black and Jimenez are often very, very funny.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Spielberg Can't Go Wrong ... Can He?"></head><body><p>Having just watched the DVD last night, everything is fresh in my memory...  Was I disappointed in this outing by the great director?  Not really.  Even middle-of-the-road Spielberg is better than most other director's best efforts.  Tom Hanks plays geeky FBI Agent and nemesis to Di Capprio's devil-may-care con-kid (not really a con-man, since Dicapprio's character starts doing all these crazy things at the age of seventeen).  It is effortless and free as the story uhnfolds, not answering a whole lot of questions that might pop up.  Hmmmm.  Being that this is "Based On A True Story" does make it a bit more interesting.  All in all...a good weeknight sitdown movie.  Something to watch after a heart-attack MNF game to take the edge off the day.  Nothing extra-extra-special here.  Certainly not Speileberg's best effort.  But DiCapprio shines and so does Tom Hanks and that makes up for some lackluster script strains.  The fact that this guy actually impersonated a pilot, a doctor, and a state prossecutor as well as floated over $4 million in bogus checks in the mid-to-late 60's is very impressive.<br /><br />Dig it!</p></body></html>

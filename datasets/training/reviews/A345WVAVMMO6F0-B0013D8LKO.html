<meta name="summary" content="kubrick's sardonic comedy ranks among the greatest films"></head><body><p>hellooo? did critics see the same movie i saw? this movie joins stanley kubricks great science fiction trilogy of 1964-71 ("dr strangelove", "2001", "clockwork orange") in my list of the 100 best films ever. tom cruise reminds us that if you skip the baggage hes a fine actor (always has been, always will be) and nicole kidman was ridiculously not even nominated for an oscar (repeating the injustice of "to die for", and pointing out even more the absurdity of her eventual victory in the bloated "the hours"). there is sooooo much going on in this movie. this is imho the finest comedy of manners (does anybody even know what that phrase means nowadays?) about american life since "the graduate". i remember being 14 years old and sitting in a theater watching "2001" with my bewildered parents and looking over and realizing the gap was there (love you still, mom & dad); you either get this film or you dont, but i defy anyone to not remember it. thank you stanley kubrick, for the rich movie experiences you gave us, and especially for this final masterpiece to which i will gladly return.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Interesting premise, great production, muddled story"></head><body><p>I just watched "District 9" on DVD, and now kind of wish I'd seen it on the big screen. The production values are impressive and the lead actor (Copley) deserves to be nominated for a "best performance" award. But while the movie's premise - aliens stranded on Earth, herded into a grubby shantytown - offers grist for social commentary, the pacing is slow at the start and the story deteriorates into "Transformers" style blow-em-up action near the end. Definitely a cut or two above average, but its flaws keep it from earning five stars.</p></body></html>

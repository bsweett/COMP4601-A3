What I didn't expect was that under the comedy, which we assumed we'd get from these very funny guys, would actually be a cracking mystery that would hold my interest just as much as Pegg and Frost's banter.<br /><br />Plot: Nicholas Angel (Pegg) is a cop's cop, the kind of guy who can make a mugger put down the purse and back away just by cocking an eyebrow. Problem is, he's making the rest of his department look bad, so they conspire to get him sent to Sandford, a quiet town in the country well-known for its low crime rate. He gets off to a great start when he gets there by finding one of the town's rare crimes; he's not even on the force yet, but he ends up hauling in a guy for drunk driving. Of course, the next morning, he finds out that the guy he hauled in is his new partner, Danny Butterman (Frost). Sandford's police force is very laid-back; why shouldn't they be? After all, the town has almost no crime. That doesn't sit well with Angel's type A personality, of course, so he starts looking around to see if there's anything the lackluster bobbies around him have simply been overlooking. With Danny as his reluctant accomplice, Angel starts investigating a series of accidents he finds suspicious. Together, the two of them get closer and closer to what's looking like a major conspiracy. Their challenge then becomes figuring out who's behind the conspiracy before those unknowns can stop their investigation permanently.<br /><br />Put Pegg, Wright, and Frost together and you're basically guaranteed a good time. Shaun of the Dead was a brilliant send-up of zombie films, but really, when it came right down to it, it was a straight comedy, albeit one that was fantastically made. Hot Fuzz, while just as hysterical as Shaun, is not a straight comedy at all, and shows the versatility of Wright as a director, Frost and Pegg as actors, and all three of them as co-writers. Sure, you come for the comedy, and the movie delivers as expected on that front, but this is a whodunit that's got some teeth as well, and what a pleasant surprise that is. A definite recommendation, even for those who, for whatever reason, didn't like Shaun. ****</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good Adaptation With Glimmers of Greatness"></head><body><p>I haven't read much Hellboy, but I've read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593070942">enough</a> to know it's a damn good story.  There are comics that really shouldn't be made into movies and there are comics that are begging to be made into movies.  This falls into the latter category.  Take the major potential of the book and pair it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O76ZQC">Pan's Labyrinth</a>'s Guillermo del Toro (who is a major fan of the comic), and you've got a recipe for an epically awesome film that puts any of the recent super hero flicks to shame.<br /><br />However, Hellboy suffers from a weak beginning.  The opening scene--which is admittedly necessary for the rest of the story--comes off as really cheesy and badly acted.  The introduction of the titular character, the charismatic, gruff, and vulnerable Hellboy played wonderfully by Ron Perlman, makes the movie better, but it still doesn't seem to get its grounding until halfway through.  The dialogue and a lot of the plot is really campy, but somewhere along the middle, that aspect of the movie turns from annoying to endearing.  This movie isn't for everyone, because not everyone can take this level of camp, but for those who can stick it out, there is a really good story here.<br /><br />Always telling his story with beautiful images, del Toro drives this film forward with scene after scene of character and plot development, at once showing the kind of 'man' Hellboy is, and showing how bad the situation he is in is.  From the middle point to the apocalyptic end, this movie doesn't miss a beat.  It's funny, it's action packed, it's tear-jerking, and the end is thought-provoking; if only del Toro had put as much thought into the beginning of the film as he did the rest of it, this movie would get top marks.<br /><br />I will without a doubt be seeing the sequel in theaters.<br /><br />7/10</p></body></html>

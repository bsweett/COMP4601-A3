<meta name="summary" content="Mel Gibson is no William Wallace"></head><body><p>Christ knows how Mel Gibson was able to get away with playing William Wallace, much less garner an Oscar for this movie.  Gibson couldn't even hold Wallace's sword.  This has to be one of the most ridiculous attempts to take on Scottish history in Hollywood.  It made Rob Roy look good by comparison.  <p>The battle scenes look like rugby scrums, with kelt raising reducing them to parodies of the actual battles that took place. If this had been a Monty Python sketch, I would have laughed heartily throughout, but it seems Gibson was dead serious in this bloated revisionist account of Wallace's ascendency to Braveheart.  <p>I can understand how a movie like this would have fooled the general market, but is the Academy really that undiscerning? Do they have to give an Oscar to anyone who tries to make an historical epic?  It is a real mystery to me how Mel could have hoodwinked both the general public and the Academy on this one, but then it seems Scottish history is little more than fodder for Hollywood's less than fertile imagination.</p></body></html>

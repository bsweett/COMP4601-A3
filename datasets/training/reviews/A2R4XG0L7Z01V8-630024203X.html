I also notoriously hate re-watching movies that I don't particularly want to watch again. Yes, everyone gets it into their heads once in a while that they simply have to re-watch a movie, but for me, I have to be really in the mood. And sometimes it can be MORE than five years, before I feel the need/urge/whatever to watch a movie again.<br /><br />I have a confession to make - the first film I ever saw Mr Stallone in was Demolition Man (I'll have a DVD with the cut full frontal scene please). Hated him in it. I only watched it for Sandra Bullock, and that's because she is one of my favourite actresses. Back then, when I first saw it (taped off the TV don't you know), I didn't like Sly at all. I also didn't like this when I first saw it.<br /><br />But recently, I've been watching more Sly movies (Rocky's etc), and I have another confession to make - I think I've got a little crush on him. He's old enough to be my dad, but I think it's something to do with the eyes.<br /><br />First Blood is about a Vietnam veteran called John Rambo. He's what is called a 'drifter' - not a word I particularly like. He's still severely mentally affected after the war, and has numerous flashbacks (I had a blonde moment, and said the flashbacks were to the 'first' movie - duh!) During his wandering, after finding one of his friends in the war was killed by cancer, he comes across a small town, and met by the very unfriendly sheriff, who takes an instant dislike to Rambo. (Good looking, tall, dark eyes, looking very trim in some scenes - yeah, I can see how you would take an instant dislike to him.) The sheriff drops him off outside the town, but Rambo defiantly walks back into the town, kicking off a chain reaction of events.<br /><br />There's one scene that stands out in First Blood for me - the scene in the police station where Rambo is getting finger printed. I find it absolutely hilarious! He tries to wipe the ink off his fingers with a paper towel, but it gets snatched off him! It's the look on his face, a simple expression but enough to make me giggle anyway! And he still picks up another!<br /><br />First Blood is actually based on a book, which I didn't expect, and there are quite a few differences between it and the film. The film has a reputation for being really violent, but I found the Rocky movies to be more violent in that sense. However, the total body count of the movie is four; the cop who falls out of the helicopter and the three officers in the cop car who crash into a parked car. Overly violent? Not as much as some movies.<br /><br />I'd say to anyone who hated First Blood/Mr Stallone on first viewing, watch it again. Give him a chance. I wouldn't say that for anybody *cough*. It's a good action movie, and Sly acts his sad eyes out. Definitely better (in my opinion) on second viewing.</p></body></html>

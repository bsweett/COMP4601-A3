<meta name="summary" content="A case of arrested development"></head><body><p>Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates play the parents of Matthew McConaughey, a 35-year-old who still lives at home.  In an effort to get him out of the house they hire Sarah Jessica Parker, an "interventionist" who has been successful at helping other young men become independent by acting as if she is interested in them romantically.  Things get complicated when, inevitably, McConaughey and Parker become truly attracted to each other and the ruse suddenly becomes a betrayal.  The movie alternates between total cliches and a few nice moments.  The cast is good and Zooey Deschanel deserves special mention as Parker's quirky roommate.  This movie provides a pleasant evening's entertainment.</p></body></html>

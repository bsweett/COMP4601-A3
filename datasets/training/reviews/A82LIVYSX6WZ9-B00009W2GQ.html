<meta name="summary" content="a much disappointment...could of been a hell of a lot better"></head><body><p>it seems like The Wachowski Brothers forced us an ending in which we are not very satisfyed but it is still pretty damn entertaining. Keanu Reeves (upcoming Constantine, The Watcher) once again returns as Neo who is stuck in a train station...kinda the Wachowski brothers version of limbo I guess in which he is trapped and cant get out. Trinity, Carrie Ann-Moss (Red Planet, Chocolat) and Laurence Fishburne (Assault Of Precinct 13, Mystic River) return as Trinity and Morpheus as they race to rescue Neo. They accomplish their missing but Neo must go on his own to machine city where he must fight his final battle with Agent Smith, Hugh Weaving (Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, Priscilla Queen Of The Desert), so he wont take over the matrix and get out into zion. Trinity goes along for the ride but things soon happen as someone is already on the ship and he is possessed by Agent Smith...so Neo gets his eyes burnt off but he kills the intruder. Meanwhile, Morpheus and his crew....includes Link, played by Harold Perrineau Jr (Tv's OZ, Tv's Lost) and Niaobi, Jada Pinkett Smith (Collateral, Demon Knight) who  race back to zion because the sentinels have breached and are inside while the inside are trying to fight them off as best as they can. Action galore with a weak story following the grande of what Reloaded was. it seriously could of been a lot better. the climatic fight battle with Neo and Agent Smith would be the highlight. Marcy Alice plays the oracle replacing Gloria Foster who passed away while these films were in project. Also starring Lambert Wilson (Timeline), Harry Lennix (RAY, The Human Stain, Since You've Been Gone) and Gina Torres (Tv's Angel, Tv's Firefly).</p></body></html>

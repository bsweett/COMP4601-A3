Once you see HARD CANDY you'll understand what I mean. I have some theories ranging from the simple to the downright supernatural. Hayley (played by the remarkable Ellen Page) is a true enigma. As the story unfolds, we slowly find out what drives her. We are astounded by her intelligence and single-minded approach. I myself, was charmed, then utterly creeped out by this kid! Throughout the whole ordeal, I kept thinking about movies like AUDITION or EXTREMITIES. Only HARD CANDY is far more disturbing in that it threatens to shatter taboos. I didn't know where this movie was taking me, and I didn't like the feeling of uneasiness and helplessness I felt. Now, that's good horror! If you've heard that HC is "controversial", don't let that stand in your way. This movie is as tense a thriller as I've seen in a while, w/ elements that made me squirm like an eel w/ a nervous disorder! If you enjoy character-driven horror dealing w/ "controversial" (there's that word again) subject matter, then HARD CANDY should certainly satisfy. Buy immediately...</p></body></html>

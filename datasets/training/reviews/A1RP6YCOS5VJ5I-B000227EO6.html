I admit though, it didn't have any blood-spurting action scenes like the previous film did, but for what action there was, it was fantastic. This is for sure the best recent movie dealing with the martial arts. I absolutely loved it and it rekindled my fanaticism with David Carridine who I have been a fan of since I watched him on Kung Fu: The Legend Contiues in the 90's as well as the original series on repeats. Everyone chosen in this film fit their character perfectly. A lot of surprises that are untold are unveiled in this movie and you find yourself going, "oh cool", over and over again. Like I said, it didn't have all the action that the first movie had, but what it did have was an excellent story line. Very, very well written. I loved Pai, the one who trained "The Bride". Every character is very realistic and I just can't get passed how awesome this and it's prequel is. Tarantino really has set a new standard for martial arts movies that very few will every come close to accomplishing if they ever do. Tarantino is the genious of Hollywood and I am looking forward to his future films very much. Especially looking forward to Kill Bill Volume 3 in 10 to 15 years.</p></body></html>

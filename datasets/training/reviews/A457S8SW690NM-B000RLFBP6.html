Sure, some scenes are cheesy but for that time, wow! This movie is up there with the likes of the terminator. While I find the terminator to be a better movie, Robocop is close to it. Robobcop is a predictable, mindless movie that is fascinating to watch. To watch Murphy strapped into that big robotic outfit will make everyone grin. When he pulls out that huge gun, blows away some punk, and spins it around, you'll be like, wow, this is so cool. This movie is a classic with memorable one liners and fantastic humor. The action is nonstop of course. This movie is like a roller coaster ride, meaning that, it's in full gear, looking like it's about to end and then it keeps on going and there's more awesome to come.<br /><br />There's no need to talk about the plot because everyone who didn't see this should know it anyway. And for anyone grown up, 20+ who hasn't seen this! They're nuts! This is a classic! No, instead people prefer watching Titanic! Well, anyway, I really recommend buying this wicked cool movie in which a big cyborg kick everyone's a**!</p></body></html>

HF has a great cast. One of my favourite British actors from any era Jim Broadbent. Simon Pegg who has an intensity in his acting that is very funny. Bill Bailey, Nick Frost, Timothy Dalton etc etc, but somehow it just doesn't work.<br /><br />The idea behind the story has the makings of a successful comedy. Sgt Angel is sent to Sandford, a small sleepy English town, because he is too good. As Angel Simon Pegg is perfect for the role but is let down most of the time by lines that just aren't that funny. To be honest after an hour had passed I had started to lose interest and at an hour and a half I gave up. It is too long.<br /><br />Maybe on a 2nd showing I will enjoy it more, but its not a film I'd recommend anybody buying just because they liked 'Shaun of the Dead'. rent it first.</p></body></html>

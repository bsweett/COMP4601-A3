<meta name="summary" content="Sky Captain barely makes it off the ground."></head><body><p>It is unfortunate that such a movie with so much potential(see the six minute short included on the disc that was the genesis the director touted around Hollywood to get the thing made) had so little to offer when all was said and done.<br />The movie has a quite sumputous sepia toned look throughout,art deco buildings and even a late 30s P-40 Curtis Warhawk fighter plane complete with sharks teeth on the nose(the captains' preferred mode of transport).<br />However long on LOOK this movie is does NOT compensate for the stilted and see through plot that runs through this movie like so much water through a sieve.The science fiction pulp mags and 30s/40s serials that obviously inspired this movie had more depth and originality to them than this very shallow and cheap imitation.<br />Jude Law as the titular sky captain does as good a job as he can considering the material he has to work with and Gynneth Paltrow shows us once again why she is one of the top most wooden actresses in Hollywood today.<br />All in all this is one BIG disappointment;nice to look at but nothing under the hood.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A bit gory and a bit long, but what the heck. Fun film with Gibson's eye for history, too"></head><body><p>Well filmed and made (real actors<br /><br />doing real roles) but not 100%<br /><br />historically to point. So what!<br /><br />A fine actioner-drama that shows<br /><br />what kind of good work Mel can do<br /><br />when he isn't doing 'Lethal Trash'<br /><br />films...(Heck even Sam Jackson<br /><br />and Emilio Estevez in Loaded<br /><br />weapon One are better!). Pat Mc-<br /><br />Goohan is outstanding as evil King<br /><br />'Longshanks'. Gibson's "Frreeee-<br /><br />dooommm" is a haunting reminder of<br /><br />how ours is slipping away! And heard<br /><br />on several shortwave radio shows!</p></body></html>

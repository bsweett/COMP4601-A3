<meta name="summary" content="The Brave One"></head><body><p>`The Brave One' is best described as a crime thriller with a twist, the twist being that you root for the person committing the crimes. Jodie Foster plays Erica Bain, who is a DJ who gets beaten in a robbery, her fiance is killed at the same time and due to post traumatic stress turns vigilante. That is the story in a nutshell, but there are more twists and turns to the plot than my description would suggest and which I won't elaborate on to prevent spoilers. I've never been a huge fan of Foster, but her performance in this film was surprisingly good and you really get a sense of her characters fears and motivation for justice that impelled her actions. This film felt quite slow at times, but I was still kept engaged throughout. Some of the violence was quite upsetting and/or graphic, mainly the attack at the start of the film and this was a particularly hard hitting scene. This film uses some clever direction to enhance some scenes, like interspersing a love scene with a hospital scene, which made the brutality of the damage caused by the attack all the more powerful in counterpoint to the tenderness in the love scene. Overall, if you like crime films this should be right up your street and for a stellar performance from Foster this is the place to go. Not truly amazing, but a good film never the less.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

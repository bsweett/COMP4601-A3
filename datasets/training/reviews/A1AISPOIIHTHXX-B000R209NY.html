Yet there's reviews(like critic reviews) that suggests the film was tepid, overproduced and a summer blockbuster masquerading as an important tragic story of survival. It's really one of those kind of films that wants to be more than it is, even though it's got the visuals to convince you so.<br /><br />Passengers on the cruise ship Poseidon are enjoying New Years' until a rogue wave smacks the ship and tips it over, making it float upside down, slowly flooding. The only way to get out is go up, which is in reality down towards the bottom of the ship. In their way stands a ton of water, small spaces and big stunts.<br /><br />One thing that's starting to become better with Hollywood in regards to its effects is the lack of novelty to it. No longer are we going "holy [...], how'd they do that?!" like Jurassic Park or Terminator 2. Since we've seen it so many times, as well as the documentaries on it, we know how it's done so it no longer knocks us down but we can follow the story better. The wave scene definately impresses at its coolest but it's not as "whoa!" like it would be in the early 90's. Much of the film was done by real sets and stunts by the real actors so it's more impressive.<br /><br />Where the film falls apart is its characterization. One character becomes rogue and wants to be alone until all of a sudden he gets into action hero mode while the mom is so inept at a mom that it's like "you mean she's still around?". Then there's one character that's super cute and I'm being biased but once she's gone, the film just kind of felt "meh". You can tell the filmmakers wants you to feel bad when someone dies but there's not much buildup to it(except for the cutie).<br /><br />What is also disappointing is the extras for the 2-disc. I've seen single discs with more special features than this. Wolfgang Petersen's quite the info heavy when it comes to commentaries...there isn't one. The film apparently went through a severe edit to make the film seem quicker yet there's no deleted scenes. Expect a triple-dip sometime in the future.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the film, I suggest waiting. You should rent it first just to...excuse the pun but "test the waters".</p></body></html>

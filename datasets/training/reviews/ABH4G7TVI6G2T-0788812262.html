<meta name="summary" content="Mary Poppins - 40 years and still looking great!"></head><body><p>The all-new 40th Anniversary edition of MARY POPPINS is definitely a must-own for all fans of the movie, and has been well worth the wait.  As the editorial review states, this is the third DVD of MARY POPPINS to be released.  The last edition (on the Gold Classics label) featured a great print but scant extras and fans simply knew that the Disney company should have done a better job remastering and releasing one of their most beloved films.  Our prayers have been answered!<br /><br />This brand-new MARY POPPINS features a state-of-the-art new digital restored print (similar to that done on the SNOW WHITE Platinum Edition), and a veritable carpetbag-full of extra features, the big highlight being an audio commentary by Dame Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and Karen Dotrice among others.<br /><br />It is indeed a thrilling movie experience.  Out of the dreary London skies soars Mary Poppins, who sets about restoring the love and friendships in the fractured Banks family.  Along the way Mary leads us through many magical adventures including a 'Jolly Holiday' inside a pavement chalk picture, a tea party on the ceiling with Uncle Albert and a dance on the rooftops with Bert and his chimney-sweep pals.<br /><br />Other 'Supercalafragilisticexpialidocious' extras include a sequence deleted from the picture ("Chimpanzoo"), to an all-new retrospective documemtary with interviews with all the surviving lead cast-members.  Julie Andrews (who has renewed her ties to the Disney family with her role as Queen Clarisse in the PRINCESS DIARIES films) also has a lovely chat with Dick Van Dyke and composer Richard Sherman as they reminisce about making the movie.<br /><br />If you own the earlier DVD edition and think you've seen MARY POPPINS think again!  This all-new 40th Anniversary tribute is the ultimate testament to this magical Disney masterpiece!  Buy it today!</p></body></html>

Rose is the oldest - responsible, a lawyer, intelligent, and works too much. Maggie is dyslexic, impulsive, and drinks too much to avoid growing up. When Maggie gets too drunk during her 10th anniversary high school reunion her stepmother Sydelle kicks her out and she goes to live with her sister. The trouble is that Maggie brings chaos everywhere she goes. One night Maggie goes too far - breaking Rose's shoes, stealing money and jewellery, and having an affair with Rose' boyfriend. Rose kicks Maggie out of her life and Maggie runs to their long lost grandmother in Florida.<br /><br />When Rose meets her grandmother Ella she tries to sponge off her too and try to steal money. Grandma catches on and tells Maggie to get a job at the assisted living hospital. Meanwhile, Rose quits her job and falls for Simon whose advances she spurned at their law firm. Eventually Ella invites Rose down to Florida to repair the sisters' relationship. Once reunited both girls find out the truth about their mother's death and how much they still need each other.</p></body></html>

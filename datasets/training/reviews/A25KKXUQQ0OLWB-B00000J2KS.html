Malcolm McDowell became well known for this role and a movie about futuristic street gangs had a resounding effect on Great Britain where Stanley Kubrick had the movie withdrawn after death threats.  Malcolm McDowell portrays a psychopathic hoodlum who rapes, beats and eventually murders vulnerable citizens.  After 2 years in prison, he agrees to a scientific study intended to steer him from violent tendencies and make him a productive citizen.  Instead it causes him to become a helpless victim of violence himself.  The story is never as momentous as the quality of the filmmaking and direction.  This film is truly Stanley Kubrick.</p></body></html>

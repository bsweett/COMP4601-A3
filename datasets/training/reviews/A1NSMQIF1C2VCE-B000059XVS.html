<meta name="summary" content="The two best movies ever made"></head><body><p>&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; was made at a time when films still had intermissions and with films as long as this, they needed it.<p>Here, though, that inevitable break in the movie is put to good use: &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; is really two great movies. The first is about how an ordinary guy becomes a hero, with derring do that's an unacknowledged precursor to both the Indiana Jones and Star Wars movies as much as it influenced more &quot;serious&quot; works.<p>For my money, though, the second half is where it really gets interesting, because I don't recall seeing many other films that actually tackle what happens when someone has to live up to being a hero -- especially a film that will take the question seriously, rather than use it as a chance for Movie of the Week schmaltz. The decline and fall of Lawrence is as gripping as any other film I've seen, and would stand on its own as a film classic even without the lead-in.<p>Together with beautiful vistas -- not seeing this in letterbox is a flat-out crime -- the greatest moments of some classic actors (see why Omar Sharif actually deserves his big name recognition) and amazing set pieces decades before &quot;Braveheart,&quot; &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; has something for everyone: It's a serious art piece, it's an action movie, it's an adventure.<p>And it's a well-deserved classic that should be seen by everyone.</p></body></html>

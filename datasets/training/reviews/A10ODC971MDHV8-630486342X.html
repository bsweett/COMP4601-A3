<meta name="summary" content="Reservoir Dogs"></head><body><p>A brilliant, brutal heist film focusing on the before and after rather than the act itself, Tarantino's darkly funny "Reservoir Dogs" was the most auspicious debut of the 1990s, brought to life through the efforts of Keitel, who was impressed with the unconventional script. Tarantino peppers his film with pop-culture references, salty dialogue, and flashbacks that not only heighten suspense but fill in the back stories of his key characters. Keitel, Roth, Buscemi, Chris Penn, and Michael Madsen really run with their roles as bickering psychopaths. Great use of `70's period music as well- anyone remember "Stuck In The Middle With You?" At once graphically violent and darkly funny, "Reservoir Dogs" has one hell of a bite.</p></body></html>

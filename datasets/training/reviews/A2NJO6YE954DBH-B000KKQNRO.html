<meta name="summary" content="A boiled down version of the mega-blockbuster novel that few will embrace totally"></head><body><p>When I saw the movie version of "The Da Vinci Code" what I remembered about the books where the basics: who is the villain, what is the Holy Grail, and where the body is buried. I recognized all of the puzzles that Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) has to solve, although I did not really remember the solutions, so I was in the fortuitous position of not really recalling what was about to happen next. Consequently, I was just able to go along with the movie and enjoy how the cinematic adaptation of Dan Brown's novel played out. However, I realize that this is a point of equilibrium that will not apply to most reviewers, because on the one hand there will be those who have not read the novel who might have trouble keeping up with all the pieces, while on the other there will be devotes of the book who will be anguished by everything left out or changed in the transformation from novel to film.<br /><br />At the Musee de Louvre in Paris, Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle) is shot by a a mysterious figure in a monk's habit named Silas (Paul Bettany). Before he dies Sauniere leaves a series of clues, which point to Langdon, a Harvard professor whose forte is religious symbols. Captain Fache (Jean Reno) of the Paris police is convinced Langdon is the murderer, but Langdon is helped to escape by Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), the granddaugther of the murdered man, who believes Langdon can decipher the clues. Langdon needs the help of Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen), an expert on the legends of the Holy Grail, to understand what is really at stake. Meanwhile, both Fache and Silas are chasing after Langdon and Sophie, spurred on by the machinations of Bishop Arigarosa (Alfred Molina).<br /><br />I cannot speak for those who have not read the book, But I certainly do not think that director Ron Howard has made a thriller simply because the story revolves around thinking and talking more than anything else, so I would qualify it as more of a mystery than anything else. Certainly it does not have the frenetic energy of the modern thriller movie, where the camera never stands still because you might actually see what is happening on screen. Akiva Goldsman's screenplay focuses on Robert Langdon as a problem solver and leaves the heavy exposition to the Leigh Teabing character. Langdon is more of a skeptic in this version, which allows him to be more reasonable than the true believers.  Actually, what might be the most fascinating part of the movie is when we first meet Langdon and he is lecturing on symbols and using visual aids to show that symbols are meant to be interpreted (which I take to be the caveat they provided instead of the disclaimer in the opening credits many insisted upon).<br /><br />Langdon makes a key distinction at one point when he tells Sophie that the complicated situation in which they find themselves involves people who believe that all of these stories about Mary Magdalene et. al is true. The distinction is important because ultimately "The Da Vinci Code" does not have to convince us that any of this is true, but rather than there are people who believe it and that those beliefs help to solve the various clues. The book's puzzles are greatly reduced in the movie, while the significance of the story of Mary Magdalene grows in relationship. There will be those who are disappointed by the former, and those who will be scandalized by the latter.</p></body></html>

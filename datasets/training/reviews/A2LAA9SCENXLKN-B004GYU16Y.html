<meta name="summary" content="Just needs a little pepper. No joke, this is supposed to be a real analogy."></head><body><p>For all my reviews visit my website<br /><br />I am NOT reviewing the DVD. Just the movies unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.<br /><br />I'm just gonna tell you right now the reviews I do today will be shorter than usual. Well, Salt was advertised as "A Russian Spy 'someone is framing me'" extreme cliche. I love cliches, I love cheese, and if corn can be done right I love it. I watch Godzilla ALL THE TIME. (I promise there will be some Godzilla reviews by the end of October, most likely the original or G vs. Megagirus.) Well...even if I would spoil the movie for you, I don't think I would be able to. But I can tell you, they try there hands at some sort of a twist. But don't trust me, because this movie was very confusing.<br /><br />And not the good confusing like Inception, more like the bad confusing, something that the more you pay attention the less you understand. Watch a few Nostalgic Critic episodes you'll understand. That's my main complaint, is that the whole movie is founded on a hole. No matter how much good stuff you put in the movie, no matter how much of it nor how good, WATER GO DOWN THE HOLE!!!! (Sorry, I just got finished watching Nostalgic Critic's Animaniacs tribute.) Now we talk about the action. Usually in a good action movie, all you need is jumping and explosions. In a great action movie, you get jumping, explosions and muscles. In a fantastic action movie, you get jumping, punching, explosions, muscles, guns, everything. In a MASTERPIECE, you have all that plus a fantastic plot to back it up. This...was mediocre. Jumping, that is it.<br /><br />Now, aside from that, the real part where this movie makes up for all the faults 80% is in the characters. Why only 80? Because it doesn't make it better, it just off-sets. They are extremely well developed and have some cliched yet awesome and intriguing personalities. Just so fun to watch them talk and interact with the environment around them. And that makes the casting not only Angelina, but everybody in the cast and directing chairs extremely well performed. But a bad script is a bad script. The only thing about the directing I think could have been improved would be to step in and add a little more of the good stuff. The director has a lot of experience but not in the greatest stuff, so I think some constructive criticism could be useful.<br /><br />Salt was very good, but it needed pepper. But again, the real reason to see this movie is the characters, I think if we buy a ticket to support anybody, it would be to support the actors. What a fantastic cast. But I don't think I'll buy it on Blu-Ray/DVD.<br /><br />Well, for the characters alone I would rate it 4.5, but because of it's faults, it draws it down ALL THE WAY to 3.4/5<br /><br />I, Da Ca$hman signing off.</p></body></html>

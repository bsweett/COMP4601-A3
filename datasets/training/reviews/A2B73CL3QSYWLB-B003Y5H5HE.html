<meta name="summary" content="Scorsese Paints Another Masterpiece"></head><body><p>As Martin Scorsese enters the twilight of his career he continues to challenge himself as an artist and challenging the audience along with him.  I can think of three primary goals Scorsese had in mind making "Hugo".  Firstly he wanted to advance the 3-D technological process but in turn he imbued it with heart that distinguishes "Hugo" from "Transformers" and their ilk.  Secondly he wanted to make a family film that not only engages the children but allows adults to appreciate the subtleties.  Lastly he wanted to promote his pet cause of film preservation and in turn resurrecting the legacy of French silent filmmaker George Melies.  Scorsese has assembled an impressive cast but special mention should be made for the youngest actors, Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz, whose work here belies their tender years.  There are innumerable riches that can be mined in "Hugo".  The star rating system does it no justice.  "Hugo" is an instant classic.</p></body></html>

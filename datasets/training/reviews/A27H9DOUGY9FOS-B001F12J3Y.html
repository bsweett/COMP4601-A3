<meta name="summary" content="Got A One-Way Ticket On "The Polar Express." It Was OK Once, But I Won't Be Returning"></head><body><p>A scrooge all year round, I have another opportunity to upset some people with my two-cents on "The Polar Express." I came into the film with no preconceptions.  If anything, I thought it would be cute and pleasant. I am not one of those people who treasures the book and dislikes the film for not being true enough. While I may not be the most sensitive viewer in the world, I've been known to enjoy a good Christmas tale or two. The animated Grinch, Frosty and Rudolph all work for me. "A Christmas Story," "It's A Wonderful Life" and a number of variations of "A Christmas Carol" always delight. And I love animated features from classic Disney to current day Pixar (only the good ones, of course). But, truth be told, "The Polar Express" kind of mystified me.<br /><br />The film has some visually appealing moments, and the animation is state of the art. The action sequences were technically impressive. I particularly enjoyed the scenes with no characters (for reasons I'll outline in a bit). The exterior shots of the train are stunning, especially during the more exciting moments. When the Express is racing around roller coaster tracks or sliding across ice, the movie comes to life. And an extended sequence following a ticket as it flies through the air is artfully done, a truly great moment. The voice acting is fine. While I didn't particularly think it stood out, it also didn't hamper the story. And the plot was serviceable, if not unique in any way.<br /><br />Much has been made about using the real actor's movements and turning them into animation. I certainly don't have a problem with the concept, but in some cases, it had an unfortunate effect. I truly found some of the characters to be creepy. Now, I usually try to use objective wording, but "creepy" is exactly how my friend and I both described it after the movie. And interestingly enough, it is a word used many, many times within other critical reviews. The little girl, especially, was so unreal in her realness.  I don't know, something was lost in the translation.<br /><br />Then there were a couple of exceedingly odd musical numbers. One, the songs were bizarre. And two, the frantic pacing of the accompanying "dance" performances (be it by waiters or elves) was jarring and unsettling. The music adds nothing to the story except another opportunity to be "creeped out." I didn't feel it was necessary to try to extend this story, the film is too long by half. Only the most attentive and patient of adults or children are likely to make it to the end without needing a break. While, of course, the film's message is sweet, it's laid on so thickly at the end. I know some people love this film, but for me it didn't work. Call me Scrooge this year, but "The Polar Express" will not be joining my annual Christmas viewing. KGHarris, 12/06.</p></body></html>

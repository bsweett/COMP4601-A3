<meta name="summary" content="HIT AND A MISS"></head><body><p>This film is a classic revenge film. You will like this film because Butler has acted very well and some of the action scenes are like a good quality thriller. The story is very lacking and though Jamie Foxx made a great Ray Charles - in this film he made me question his being an actor. He was very average. The whole film revolves around the character of Butler, there are some action scenes, prison scenes, half intelligent dialogs and grit but that's about it. I felt the ending was so so, please watch this film before buying it blindly. Not recommended for a younger audience.</p></body></html>

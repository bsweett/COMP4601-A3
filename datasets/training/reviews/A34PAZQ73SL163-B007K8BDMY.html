Let me say at outset that this is an absolutely magnificent film. Its excellence is rarely encountered. Indeed, it is one of the few documentaries I ever longed to play a second time after it finished.<br /><br />Treadwell was an environmental activist, and also, as his narrative makes clear, a very emotionally disturbed person. He failed at making it in society so he turned to the wilderness and the world of the "misunderstood" bear as a means to find fulfillment. He went to Alaska every summer to "save them" from poachers, but, as an authority stated, the animals were not in need of saving. Their population was so robust they needed to be culled by hunters each year. That the bears somehow needed Treadwell is just one of the many lies this man embraced. One person phrased it aptly: "He has styled himself the Prince Valiant of the bears."<br /><br />The main character is quite pathetic, but the viewer has difficulty feeling sympathy for him due to his negligence in regards to his girlfriend, Amie Huguenard. I have never encountered an individual in my entire life with a bigger death wish that Treadwell. On camera, he imagines his own death several times, yet this supposedly compassionate person stayed with his girlfriend long past the gorged days of summer, and remained amidst the bears while the desperate ones searched for any scrap of nutrients in the hopes of surviving the winter. That he had not ever remained in the grizzly maze past summer before is evidence of his scripting his own demise, and allowing Huguenard to die alongside him was despicable. I'm a very politically incorrect man, and I don't buy into female victimization as a rule-except in this case. Treadwell led the poor woman to her death. Her biggest mistake was trusting the bipolar delusionist in the first place. In the film, he makes repeated references to wishing he were a homosexual, which his words, more so than his obvious effeminacy, suggest that he was struggling with a great many aspects of life. If you ask me, had his girlfriend possessed Gaydar then her death, the only truly tragic aspect of this calamity, might not have occurred. At any rate, Grizzly Man is amazing tour de force.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Liberal Totalitarianism"></head><body><p>In other news, I've been watching The Day After Tomorrow - the disaster picture in which the world gets turned on to a whole new ice age.  This movie is pure liberal propaganda.  Disgust you to see it.  In the beginning of the movie there is much drama about the US not signing onto the Kyoto agreement, and how this is basically the cause of the havoc that the movie is all about.  Then we are treated to the main human interest characters:  a scientist couple who are divorced (natch) and have a somewhat hostile relationship but who are bonded by their common interest in the welfare of their only child - an unmasculine teenage boy who is afraid of flying in airplanes and who grips the hand of a teenage girl companion for comfort during a bumpy flight.  Real he-man stuff.  It seems to me typically liberal that the scientist couple only had the one child.  Why strain yourself, am I right? And the girl he's got the hots for seems strangely moribund, like she doesn't get enough fresh air or something.  In the scene on the plane, the boy is trying to combat his fear of flying by gobbling candy.  Typical liberal behavior.  Moving right along, once the ice-age storm really gets going, and threatens to engulf North America, there is footage of Americans in droves trying to cross the border into Mexico.  Much reporting on the irony of this "flood of illegal immigration INTO Mexico"  The Mexican government is sealing the border until the US President cuts a deal whereby the Mexican border is opened to desperate gringos ("Ju e-like me ahora, eh gringo?!?") in exchange for - get this - the US forgiving latin American debt.  I'm not making this up.  Yet another example of how meddlesome liberals are.  You can't even see a freaking movie without it turning into a liberal indoctrination center on you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Director Joshua Marston deserves great praise"></head><body><p>This is a fabulous movie.  It definitely deserves to be ranked among the top 100 films that I've ever seen.  Director Joshua Marston has put together a well paced and riveting story concerning three young Colombian women who agree to smuggle drugs into the United States.  They do this by swallowing balloons filled with the illegal contraband.  And yes, it is dangerous and not exactly the best thing to do to one's digestive system.  Catalina Sandino Moreno is excellent as the poverty stricken and pregnant Maria who is unmarried and lacking any viable future prospects.  Carla (Patricia Rae) and Blanca (Yenny Paola Vega) are also in dire straits.  Things go tragically wrong and their lives will be changed forevermore.  New York City is a long way from their backward small towns.  The inevitable cultural shock is just the beginning of their troubles.  You will care about what happens to them.  My only complaint is that the title is somewhat misleading.  Religion plays virtually no role for any of the characters which doesn't quite ring true.  Nonetheless, Maria Full of Grace is a must see film.  It is well worth a couple hours of your precious time.</p></body></html>

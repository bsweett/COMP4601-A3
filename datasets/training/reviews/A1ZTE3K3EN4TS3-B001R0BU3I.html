This story is purposefully set up to keep you guessing for quite a while, though things clear up again by the end. Unfortunately, that means you've got to be willing to invest yourself into this story or you're going to get lost quickly. This isn't something you watch while talking on the phone or while not paying attention. But if you're willing to stick with it, you're going to find a lot to enjoy here. It's a suspenseful ride that keeps you guessing until the final moments.</p></body></html>

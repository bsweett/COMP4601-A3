<meta name="summary" content="New film draws inevitable comparisons"></head><body><p>Last summer director Christopher Nolan boldly (and wisely) chose to revamp the Batman saga with the box office smash, "Batman Begins." The producers of television's "Smallville" took "creative license" with the Superman legend, producing a show faithful to the mythology yet unique in its own right.<br /><br />Now comes, "Superman Returns," which pays homage to the previous film and television adaptations, while maintaining the "comic book daring-do" and peril. Director Bryan Singer has a genuine respect for the character and does little to alter the viewer's preconceived notions of "The Man of Steel."<br /><br />And that's the film's biggest weakness: there's very little that is fresh and exciting about this interpretation of the myth.<br /><br />Of course, the special effects are state-of-the-art and one can see the producers' investments were well spent. However, the story itself is rather basic: Superman returns from a self-imposed exile, Lois has gone on with her life and had a child, Lex Luthor is still up to no good, and Superman eventually saves the world.<br /><br />But, even in the scene where an incapacitated Superman is roughed up by Luthor and his lackeys, one never feels that the "man in blue" is ever in any danger.<br /><br />And the fact the Lois Lane survives not one but two life-ENDING situations stretch the imagination even for a science fiction/fantasy film of this type.<br /><br />As far as the performances go, Brandon Routh does a reasonably good job as Kal-el/Clark Kent/Superman, even though he had some huge shoes to fill, following Christopher Reeve who put his signature on the role. The producers of "Smallville," as well as Tom Welling, were wise enough to not have the Clark Kent character interpreted as did Reeve.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth makes a worthy "Lois Lane" and James Marsden is very good as Lane's suitor who must come to grips that his main competition is a guy "faster than a speeding bullet." Frank Langella does an adequate "Perry White," while Sam Huntingdon does a good job of "channeling" Marc McClure from the first two Reeve's films.<br /><br />Oscar-winner Eva Marie Saint is appropriately sincere as "Martha Kent"; however, "Smallville's" Annette O'Toole is a more dynamic interpretation and more of a contemporary version of Superman's "mom."<br /><br />Parker Posey's "Kitty Kowalski" is a bit too dense and doesn't compare to Valerie Perrine's "Miss Teschmacher" from the 70's films.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Kevin Spacey, though probably due to the script, makes "Lex Luthor" nothing more than a "thug with money." In both the earlier films, and both the animated and live action versions, Lex Luthor is calculating, ruthless, but possessing of an air of class about him. Michael Rosenbaum, Gene Hackman, and Clancy Brown have assayed the role, respectively, and have emboldened the character with traits the Spacey's version lacked.<br /><br />On another front, composer John Ottman borrowed familiar themes by John Williams for the original films. However, Ottman's "original" music sounds so similar to Williams's arrangements that the producers might as well have paid Williams' asking price.<br /><br />It is hoped that the next go-around will be a "return" that's a tad "fresher."<br /><br />3.5 stars, rounded off to 4</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock and Cary"></head><body><p>Self-assured Madison Avenue ad exec Grant inavertently gets involved with international spies when they mistake him for someone else. His problems are compounded when he's framed for murder.The movie where Grant and Saint  dangle from Mount Rushmore and a plane chases Grant through farm fields. An  exceptional performance by Grant plus plenty of plot twists (which are  mixed with tongue-in-cheek humour) make this one of Hitch's most  entertaining films (some say his best). Laserdisc includes letterboxing,  digital soundtrack, Hitchcock interview, production and publicity photos,  storyboards and the original trailer.</p></body></html>

It's the action-packed motion picture, MACHETE, that you aren't supposed to take too seriously. It fulfills the promise raised in one of the faux trailers from the 2007 theater release of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's double-billed GRINDHOUSE. A slew of big name actors graces this exercise in pseudo-exploitation cinema, but towering above them all is Danny Trejo as the brutish, laconic Machete Cortez, that vengeful ex-Federale. Trejo's face is so weathered it resembles a page out of a Thomas Guide. And yet he is somehow a chick magnet, if you buy into the film. No less than two hotties - Michelle Rodriguez and Jessica Alba - throw themselves at him.<br /><br />When one sets foot on the vengeance trail, it's best to have a huge friggin' machete to wave around menacingly. Machete Cortez is an old school sort of hombre stalking a modern world. His impractical tool of choice is the machete, even though he frequently has access to less primitive weaponry. But he's very good with his namesake blade. He cuts a friggin' swath.<br /><br />For shucks and giggles Robert Rodriguez, early on, inserts grainy footage to emulate those trashy old 1970s flicks. This alerts us that there'll be plenty of tongue-in-cheek shenanigans going down. The plot, such as it is, concerns the hot button topic of illegal immigration. Robert DeNiro, who's stooping to everyone's level now, plays conniving senator John McLaughlin, an aw-shucks, unctuous and drawly gent who is up for re-election. He's standing fast with his platform of proudly crapping on illegal immigrants. Scorning the even playing field, he hatches a fiendish scheme to garner him even more votes.<br /><br />Three years after the murders of his wife and daughter, Machete Cortez has snuck across the border, assisted by an underground network. Today, disenchanted and without purpose, the ex-Federale struggles as a day laborer. And then, because misfortune is a cruel b!tch, Machete gets framed for an assassination attempt on Senator McLaughlin. Now a man on the run, can Machete Cortez muster up his dusty skills as a buttkicking investigator? More importantly, can he score a machete somewhere?<br /><br />Let me reiterate, MACHETE is not meant to be taken seriously. Not when Lindsey Lohan's sporting a nun's habit and Michelle Rodriguez is running a taco truck and Jessica Alba is supposed to be a tough-as-nails immigration officer. And certainly not when Steven Seagal is playing a ruthless, sword-wielding Mexican drug lord. And when Machete gets on the loose, the coordinator of the frame job places a call to 1-800-HITMAN. I won't even mention those scantily clad nurses toting automatic weapons.<br /><br />Rodriquez cheerfully constructs a mythology around Machete. He's got him plonked in the center of a brewing revolution. His past exploits are already legendary. It doesn't hurt Machete's street creds any that, in one jaw-dropping sequence, he... let's just say he tests a goon's intestinal fortitude. To quote one villain, Machete "looks like CIA, FBI, DEA, all rolled into one mean f------ burrito."<br /><br />Performance-wise, the cast doesn't exactly cover itself in glory but I don't think it embarrasses itself, either. Besides, these characters are across-the-board over-the-top, which then gives us license to sit back and be more forgiving. Danny Trejo plays Machete just right, as a silent and implacable and sort of mysterious man of action. The humor is overt, perhaps to the detriment of narrative cohesion. But I really liked the riff on how everyone automatically admits a Mexican into their homes, providing he shows up with gardening tools. And Rodriguez's good luck charm and staple, Cheech Marin, is always worth a watch. MACHETE is a wild nudge in the ribs. It is packed with outrageous mayhem and cartoon violence. It even takes a semi-serious stab at a relevant issue, or relevant at least here on the left coast. And maybe on the U.S./Canadian border. I hear the Mounties are cracking down hard on any Yank trying to sneak across their border. Those health care benefits are so damn seductive.<br /><br />I guess MACHETE earned enough good will, because a sequel, MACHETE KILLS, has been greenlit and is already shooting. It looks to feature Mel Gibson, Charlie Sheen, and a reprising Michelle Rodriquez. There's a rumor circulating that Tony Jaa may even be in it, if he's done being a hermit in the woods. There's an eye towards a 2013 release. I'd Facebook Danny Trejo for confirmation, except we already know that "Machete don't text."<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- 5 Deleted Scenes (totals 00:06:32 minutes and includes two scenes which features Sartana Rivera's twin)<br />- Watch MATCHETE with the Audience Reaction Track<br />- 2 MACHETE theatrical trailers</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="'Rambo's' Resurrection Spare on Sentimentality"></head><body><p>Resurrecting `Rambo' doesn't offer much sentimentality.  Unlike `Rocky Balboa' where we get lingering memories of previous fame and Adrienne's haunting presence, Sylvester Stallone brings back John Rambo after a twenty-year hiatus with nothing more than harrowing flashbacks from his Vietnam experiences.  These brief, yet skillful scenes are taken from past movies, cleverly revealing his inner turmoil, flashing before our eyes. This time they don't fool around.  Clocking in at 1:23, this installment of the action adventure series doesn't leave much to the violent imagination.  Stallone and company don't waste much time getting reacquainted with the audience.<br /><br />Starting in the present, Rambo (Stallone) returns to Burma as an ex-green beret seeking to free captive humanitarian workers (Julie Benz and Matthew Marsden).  Rambo's rogue mission finds him fully confident with few words as he works with a mutinous, motley crew led by Aussie leader, Lewis (Graham McTavish).  In one scene Rambo tells the volunteer couple, "You're never going to change the world."  Well, then, Rambo, what are you doing here?  I guess he does believes in change; he just doesn't agree with their methods.<br /><br />At times graphic, the combat scenes are well-edited and riveting to watch.  I can't remember the last time I've seen such a suspenseful, harrowing, and gruesome action adventure, but I can guarantee you it never gets dull.  (Women and children are often seen killed along with the military men, so viewer discretion is advised.)</p></body></html>

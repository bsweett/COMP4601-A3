<meta name="summary" content="A bland drama that still stands out because of the acting"></head><body><p>The Pursuit of Happyness stars Will Smith, who plays Chris Gardner, in an emotional drama based on a true story. Set in 1981, Chris is a struggling medical equipment salesman. Chris is a smart guy, but made the mistake of selling medical equipment in which he had to buy all the product up front and then finds out no one wants the stuff.  So, Chris has a wife that basically hates him and a job that isn't paying and bills that are due. With his life going down the tubes, Chris sees the lifestyles that the successful stockbrokers have and wants it. He applies for an internship and gets it, but finds out the job doesn't pay a salary. Then his wife leaves him and his young son, played by Smith's actual son.<br /><br />Chris juggles daycare and bills and selling the medical equipment while trying to learn the ins and outs of selling stocks. Eventually, the bills catch up with him and Chris and his son are homeless, forced to fight for places in line at homeless shelters.<br /><br />This movie was a successful Christmas blockbuster and the preview packs an emotional punch. I expected a feel-good tear jerker, but what I got was a drama without the highs and lows expected from the genre.  The problem I saw is the lack of conflict. Sure, Chris is homeless and poor, but we know he eventually succeeds.  Also, every executive Chris encounters treats him nicely or with respect, so we never see Chris as the object of ridicule that he could have been considering his at time rough appearance.  This is a well made movie and entertaining, but it moves along at a predictable pace<br /><br />By no means do I think this is a bad movie. I highly recommend it. Smith is excellent, his kid (Jaden Smith) isn't as good of an actor as some have said. Especially enjoyable is Chris's interaction with some of the Dean Witter clients and his ploy to get free tickets to a San Francisco 49ers game. This movie has a few moments of bad language but other than that is a good family film.</p></body></html>

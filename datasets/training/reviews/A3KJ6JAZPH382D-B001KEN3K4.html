It was Mel Brooks at his slapstick best, and the pairing of Don Adams with Barbra Feldman remains one of the more iconic pairings in TV history. The best thing about this filmatic adaptation is that he maintains the zany spirit of the original. That's due primarily to the comic capabilities of Steve Carell as the new Maxwell Smart.<br /><br />Carell, who has proved over and over that he shares the knack for comedy with folks like Steve Martin or Jim Carrey, provides the anchor for the films best moments. His deadpan delivery of clueless everyman is perfect for Max, who starts the film as the best details man in CONTROL, but wants more than anything else in the world to be a secret agent. When he finally passes the test, Chief (a spot on Alan Arkin) tells Max that he's SO good at details that the bureau can't let him out of the building.<br /><br />A chance snafu occurs that forces Max onto spy detail, and along with a deft Anne Hathaway as Agent 99, they go to bring done a plan by CHAOS to sell nukes. Globe-trotting silliness ensues, along with plenty of good jokes, physical comedy and nods to the original series. (Watch for the brief cameo with Mel Brooks, and Bill Murray as the hidden Agent 13.) While the pace is snappy and there is obviously a sequel baiting ending, there are a few things that would have made this a better film.<br /><br />Maxwell Smart, in the original, was not oafish or that aware of his ineptitude. In fact, it was is boisterous self-confidence that often made him get into problematic situations. "Get Smart" the movie didn't hit that target. Also, the political parody and bite in the TV series was always subtle, so a hamfisted 9/11 George Bush slam seemed both awkward and pointless, even while Ziegfried line about dead celebrities and their "razor-sharp political advice" almost made up for it. Should the inevitable sequel arrive, hopefully these things will be addressed. I am already envisioning the Hymie flick....</p></body></html>

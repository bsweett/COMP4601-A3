<meta name="summary" content="Applecart"></head><body><p>One of the finest science fiction films of the 1980's, in fact one of the finest Hollywood films of the 1980's, 'Robocop' is a dark, extremely violent satire on all kinds of things, most notably television and big  business. Featuring a mixture of hot military hardware, and a self-mocking  tone that makes you slightly ashamed to be enjoying the hot military  hardware, it's probably Paul Verhoven's finest 80 minutes, and spawned two  of the most dismal sequels since 'Grease 2' and the one that came after  'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid', you know - the 'prequel'.<p>On DVD,  it's tops - one-time Laser Disc specialists Criterion know what they're  doing. The picture and sound quality is excellent, and the extra bits are  extremely good - a set of amusing storyboards (which are presented in a  dynamic fashion - you get to watch somebody jiggling the paper around as  ED209 blows away a hapless executive), and some extra violence are the  stand-outs.</p></body></html>

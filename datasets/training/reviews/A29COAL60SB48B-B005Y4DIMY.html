<meta name="summary" content="All horror movies should be made like this"></head><body><p>Clive Barker proved he is a genius not only in the printed word but behind the camera as well.  This, the first installment of the Hellraiser series, should be the measuring stick by which *real* horror should be judged.<br /><br />By reading the reviews here, a person will understand the plot.  But what one can't put into words is the fear that gets caught in your throat whenever the Cenobites appear (the handful of times you see them).  That's how a horror film is supposed to work: Having the monster(s) scare the crap out of everyone - characters and audience alike - without having to make too many appearances (and definitely *not* cracking cute one-liners to ease the tension for the chickens in the audience).<br /><br />As a fan of Freddy Krueger (more than Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees), I remember watching this the first time and being quite frightened.  I actually appreciated watching a horror movie that was able to elicit fear - that did its job of scaring me.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as another reviewer pointed out, this series really went downhill.  My feeling is that Pinhead was mass marketed to the high heavens to make him more likeable for the masses (like Freddy and Jason), taking away his scariness and making him crack laughable one-liners.  I saw an interview years back with Clive Barker and he expressed regret that he allowed Pinhead to be mass marketed (using Pinhead's likeness on everything from dolls to trading cards).  He felt that all the marketing caused Pinhead to lose his effectiveness as a monster.<br /><br />As a fan of true horror, I couldn't agree more.</p></body></html>

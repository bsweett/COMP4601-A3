<meta name="summary" content="Williams makes a great movie villian"></head><body><p>I never expected Robin Williams to be so good as the villian in this picture.  In this one we see early on that he plays a cat and mouse game with Pacino.  Pacino's character accedently kills his partner while he's chasing Williams.  He knows this and never lets him forget it thoughout the movie.  All in all it's a movie you can watch again because the characers in it are so interesting.  So if you bought this one in the budget bin like I did you won't be sorry for the money you spent for it.  There is lots of good dialogue and character bits here.  For Hitchcock fans (who remember him) ...it is in the tradition of his films because you don't know what to expect.</p></body></html>

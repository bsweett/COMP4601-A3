<meta name="summary" content="How Much Can We Bear?"></head><body><p>How much shame? No more than we deserve, all of us. How much guilt? Not yet quite enough, I fear. Obviously we crave more grief in atonement for the atrocities of the foulest century of our history, since we eat up films and novels that depict it. Do you, esteemed reader, feel guilt and shame at the genocides perpetrated by your species against each other? If not, you're unworthy of something we call humanity.<br /><br />W'adys'aw Szpilman, the "pianist" of the film, was not a hero. He was a survivor. Perhaps that's the best any of us can claim, to be survivors. But then, there's the phenomenon known as "survivor's guilt." I've known several Holocaust survivors; in fact, I'm related to some by marriage. Some express guilt, some express gratitude, but I've never heard one boast of survival. In any case, Szpilman was a real person, whose post-war memoir attracted little notice until decades after the events it described. The first film based on it, made in Poland in 1949, was suppressed by the Communists. Szpilman's son republished the memoir in 1998, first in German and then in English. Szpilman died in Warsaw in July, 2000 at the age of 88, two years before the release of this film directed by Roman Polanski.<br /><br />The first three-quarters of this film are agonizing. Horrible. Plausible. My wife couldn't handle it. She went off to bed to read a new "Parker" novel for relief. The acting, to be honest, isn't brilliant, but the cinematic portrayal of the brutality of the Nazis in Warsaw obviated any need for character development. Then came the escape. The survival despite all odds. Battle scenes, flight across roofs, the wry humor of near starvation assuaged by a can of pickles. And at last, One Just Man, one German capable of pity. That German officer, Wilm Hosenfeld, really did appear in the memoir; his identity was later confirmed, and it's known that he died in a Soviet gulag. I suppose the end of the film is intended as a statement of comfort and optimism, possibly as a signal of reconciliation. From the moment Szpilman is discovered in hiding by Hosenfeld, music swells in the film. Hosenfeld orders Szpilman to play the piano, and director Polanski gives us quite a long concert view of the Pianist's hands on the keyboard. The Russians arrive, the war is over in a few quick edits, and Szpilman is at the keyboard again in a rebuilt radio studio. The end of the film shows Szpilman performing a concerto with a full orchestra. He survives. Music survives. Human decency survives. That's the message I think the film delivers, but I'm not persuaded. Not even music can redeem us. That's a powerful statement of grief and guilt, coming from me, a person who lives for music.</p></body></html>

Just think of it, Robert De Niro in front of and behind the camera, Francis Ford Coppola as one of the executive producers and starring Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie. Honey, get the popcorn!<br /><br />At least that's how it should have gone. Unfortunately the recent '06 film `The Good Shepherd' falls far short of my pre-viewing expectations. It is exceedingly slow, too long and the farthest thing from being a thriller than one could imagine. Damon sleep walks through this 2 hour, 48 minute snooze fest and Angelina is delegated to the role of a long suffering ignored housewife (as if that could happen).<br /><br />Alas, it could have been great. Who wouldn't enjoy a good conspiracy film involving an all powerful secret society like the infamous "Skull and Bones" working their way through the highest levels of American society and politics. I sure would, have you seen one?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="After All these Years it Remains the BEST James Bond Film"></head><body><p>GOLDFINGER contains a well-balanced level of depth and action leaving one emotionally charged, thrilled and entertained. This is Sean Connery's finest James Bond film and perhaps the definitive James Bond film of the entire series giving the outstanding and underrated ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE serious competition in that department after much contemplation.<br /><br />The golden girl, Oddjob's bowler hat, Goldfinger's lethal laser, the Astin Martin DB5 with modifications introduced by Q, and Shirley Bassey's legendary rendition of the theme song belted out over the titles immediately became an integral part of the James Bond lore and remained in the psyche of the public.<br /><br />Director Guy Hamilton, screen writers Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn and editor Peter Hunt were able to produce a solid, well balanced, entertaining film that does not rely totally on the spectacle and whimsy that would weaken the subsequent entries in the series.<br /><br />Production designer Ken Adam and art director Peter Murton gave the production a stunning and lavish distinction. The Fort Knox set and Goldfinger's playroom at his stud ranch was a testament to imagination and achievement. John Barry finally honed his distinctive style to perfection with this memorable score and set a benchmark of distinct and stylistic scoring for the James Bond series.<br /><br />Sean Connery's performance as James Bond is a well honed mix of determination, humor and dedication to that end of getting the job done at all costs. He brings a wry humor to the role in this film, demonstrates compassion for the opposite sex (despite what he detractors may say) and eliminates all those who present evil and malevolence to our way of life with cold detachment. He is that blunt instrument of his government but Connery does it with such aplomb.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Grossly manipulative movie with laughably bad script, plus the blu-ray price is a rip-off"></head><body><p>This film is great if you like being told how to feel, and have never seen a decent work of this ilk such as Matchstick Men. If pointless violence and rape scenes are your bag, you'll love it even more. But if you appreciate intelligence and subtlety, stick to Hitchcock and the real thriller masters.<br /><br />[Spoilers coming] The whole thing is so incredibly manipulative: we're told what to feel constantly via foreboding music and hackneyed camera shots stolen from Hitch, but with none of his finesse or humor. The ending makes it even worse; there is absolutely nothing remotely believable about the final killing of LaRoche. Nothing. "I was on my way to the bathroom and he jumped me." Oh really? In the back of the prison laundry room? Ridiculous.<br /><br />But then again, this film is full of plot holes you could drive a truck through. Owens tells his wife everything, and his lawyer, but the cops never connect the dots? His wife just forgives him for an affair and a murder? He happens to be in a hotel room next to the killings, while he's still a suspect in the other killing, and the cops never put it together? Etc.<br /><br />And when Aniston, a mediocre actress well out of her puddle-deep depth here, tells the taxi to stop, it's raining hard and the wipers are on. It stops, and one second later, presto! No rain, no wipers. It's magic! No, it's a lousy continuity man on set, and a crummy editor, and a sloppy director.<br /><br />But that's par for this course. My only question is why Owens, who is talented and the only thing (with Cassel) holding this together, took this role. There are so many other films that tackle the same ideas with more wit and elan, let alone believability.<br /><br />Never any fun, Derailed isn't thrilling either, due to the many plot holes and taking itself far too seriously. A little humor would have gone a long way, but the only funny thing here is how everyone agreed to make a movie with so many unbelievable twists, and so little real edge.<br /><br />And they price the barely-better blu-ray at five times what the dvd is going for. Perfect.<br />Well, it is a con movie, after all.</p></body></html>

As the Romans prepare to leave, the Saxons invade and the native Britons are faced with a new threat/enemy.  Moreover, the Empire finds itself in the midst of the transformation from the old traditional Greco-Roman religion to the new Christian one.<br /><br />Overall, the acting is above average, the special effects are excellent, and the plot is definitely original.<br /><br />The clash between Christendom and druidic paganism is as fascinating as the internal conflicts within the early Christian Church, and both presented very well in the film.<br /><br />The scene in the chapel/dungeon and battle on the lake are breathtaking to say the least.<br /><br />On the negative side the lead actor, Clive Owen, carries himself too much like Nicholas Cage (his voice-his appearance) as if that is who he is thinking of when reciting his lines.<br /><br />Moreover, it becomes rather tiring and annoying with the repetitive "freedom" theme, especially with the otherwise "barbarian" Guinevere (!!!) delivering modern-style lectures to Arthur.<br /><br />The setting, the special effects, the music and the costumes are all wonderful!<br /><br />Forts, Battles, and Swordfights are all about.<br /><br />In short, though not a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching!</p></body></html>

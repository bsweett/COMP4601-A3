<meta name="summary" content="A Will Ferrel Christmas"></head><body><p>This is yet another film that you can watch during this time of year. Despite it being far from perfect, it's a hilarious comedy, and I had a great time watching it. It has so many gags that work, and it has Will Ferrel as an elf (well, a human who was raised by elves)! If that doesn't seem funny to you, then I'd be fresh out of ideas. Ferrell gives a surprisingly excellent performance here, and the supporting cast is brilliant. James Caan, Bob Newhart, and Zooey Deschanel really have something here. But I think the greatest thing about this film is that it's one of those that gives you a very warm feeling about the holidays. It's about family, friendship, and most importantly, love. In short, Elf is a funny Christmas film. It may not be as memorable as It's a Wonderful Life or Home Alone, but it's still very entertaining.</p></body></html>

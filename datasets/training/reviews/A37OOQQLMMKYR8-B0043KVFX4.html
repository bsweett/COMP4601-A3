<meta name="summary" content="If you can get past Paul Anderson's lousy writing it's actually a fun flick"></head><body><p>The Resident Evil franchise sparks a lot of debates; some love it and others simply hate it and see it as far inferior to the games they were inspired by. Make no mistake the Resident Evil films will never be mistaken for a George Romero movie and quite honestly the films will remain known only thanks to the video games. The day the games fade away I'm willing to bet so will the movies.<br /><br />But with that said I will admit I have so far enjoyed this franchise for the most part. The movies aren't classics by any means, but they do make for some mindless fun and quite honestly sometimes that is all that is needed. But the Resident Evil films aren't without their flaws and the major flaw with the series is one person in particular. Paul WS Anderson. He's despised by legions of people, but he's really not that bad of a filmmaker. He's not very good, but he can produce and direct an enjoyable even if lackluster movie. But his writing is just simply horrendous.<br /><br />Resident Evil: Extinction was once again written by Paul Anderson who wrote the previous 2 and directed the original. This is a Paul Anderson screenplay you should know what to expect by now. I've never thought he was very good with the character development, but with the Resident Evil films he's at his worst. While neither this one nor the previous 2 were poorly written per se, they did feature very weak characters and if not for the actors brining more to the characters than maybe they deserved they would be a total waste. I can't help, but feel it's more of Anderson being lazy and knowing he has an audience thanks to the games.<br /><br />Resident Evil: Extinction might be the weakest written of the three, but also the best written as well. The characters all lack depth and nothing is really explained. Ali Larter was excellent as Claire Redfield, but my question who is the hell is she? I don't care if it's explained in the game. This is a feature film and not a video game. Her character could be developed in the game, but she also has to be developed in the movie. It almost seems like when Anderson writes his first draft it ends up being the final shooting script.<br /><br />I think plot wise this has a little bit more going for it, but with that said the story itself isn't very good and knocks off other movies, but the dialogue was overall far better than Resident Evil 2, which at times was cringe worthy. If not for Alexander Witt's decent directing, Resident Evil 2 could have been terrible, which is does borderline at times.<br /><br />Oded Fehr returns as Carlos Olivera and Mike Epps returns as L.J. and both of them are very much wasted. Since both survived the previous part and since both were free it seems they were brought back for the hell of it. While their characters weren't very much developed in the 2nd, here even less is done with them. While both actors make a little more of their characters they are simply there just for the hell of it. Carlos is given a little more to do than just to be there, but L.J. serves no real purpose. But at the end of the day neither character was very crucial to the movie.<br /><br />I would love to see this franchise continue without Paul Anderson; I think there is some potential for this series and while I have enjoyed all 3 for what they are just mindless fun, but Paul Anderson's weak writing hurt what would have been a much better series of films. As I stated before as a director he's not bad, he's not very good, but he can craft a movie that is enjoyable, but at the end of the day forgettable. The original Resident Evil really wasn't so bad, the script was very weak, but it did have some fairly good action scenes and was enjoyable, but again we go back to the script you'll be hard pressed to remember anyone's name. Faceless characters and that's what Anderson does best.<br /><br />As a writer Anderson, well let's just say he needs to take a few classes on how to write a screenplay. One of the clear influences on RE3 was George Romero's Day of the Dead; note to Anderson; pay attention to what Romero did with the screenplay and break it down and maybe one day you'll fully understand how to write a movie. I hate to totally trash someone and I've pretty much bashed Anderson non-stop in this review, but he deserves it. He isn't the worst writer and I'll admit I do enjoy some of his work again he can deliver a decent flick, but very forgettable, but I don't hate Paul Anderson like many people seem to do.<br /><br />Director Russell Mulcahy does a fairly good job at keeping the pace going forward, which isn't an easy task when you're directing a movie based off of a Paul Anderson script. But he mostly keeps things interesting and does deliver some solid action scenes. The poor CGI does hurt a little bit, but they're still good enough scenes so they may not annoy you too much. Of all 3 Resident Evil films this is probably the best directed, but also has possibly the weakest and better script of the 3. So therefore I won't place all the blame on Mulcahy for the flaws.<br /><br />The biggest problem with Resident Evil 3 is almost the whole movie was shot in the daylight. Movies like this barley work when shot during the day. Would all night scenes made this scary? No of course not, but that isn't really the point, but if anything it might have added a little bit of suspense and tension. I don't think night scenes would make this movie much better, but I think it would have helped a little bit.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich returns as Alice and is the brightest spot of the movie; honestly I really like her a lot. She's a fairly decent actress, but does make for a very cool heroine. Milla Jovovich is the franchise and brings a lot to a very poorly developed character. Quite honestly she's the main reason I keep coming back to the series.<br /><br />Overall Resident Evil: Extinction is a very flawed, but fun movie; by no means is this movie a classic at all. It's quite forgettable, but again it's a fun movie and a fun way to kill 90 or so minutes. My review may be a lot more negative than positive, but I do enjoy Resident Evil: Extinction, while this doesn't come highly recommended it does serve its purpose as a good popcorn flick.</p></body></html>

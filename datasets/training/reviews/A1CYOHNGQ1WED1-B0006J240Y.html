As time goes forward Julianne Moore's son first disappears from photos, then from her husband and friend's memories. You really start to wonder if her psychiatrist is right and she's made the boy's existence up altogether. Then NSA agents show up and I was really confused and even more interested. Unfortunately from there on, the movie cops out. When I found out what was going on, I deflated like a balloon. Aliens running experiments? Gee, haven't seen that before in movies, tv shows, novels, short stories, etc. It seems like the writer came up with the idea for the first part of the movie and then didn't know how to end it and what he came up with is neither original nor good.</p></body></html>

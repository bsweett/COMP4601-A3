<meta name="summary" content="Dude, why the pretension?"></head><body><p>This could have been a really fun movie and I am disappointed that it wasn't.  Had it just stuck with the cheese-o-rama approach and showed high-ons cavorting through the night it would have warranted three stars and a smile, but it kept forcing some bogus social consciousness into the story. Disappointingly, this film has an all-too-predictable politically correct edge to it.  All of the white characters, and I mean all of them, from the snowboard dudes to the cop, are offensive and racist; whereas, all of "people of color" are good.  It's absolutely ridiculous and reaches a low point when Harold runs into a guy who's in jail for "being black."  Yawn.  Come on, make a movie about slackers about slackers and not about some half-wit trendy ideology steeped in bashing whitey.  Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda should not be the target audience for a film with a premise like this one.</p></body></html>

I saw the trailers--two old coots kicking up their heels before cashing in their chips--and thought the film looked too contrived and superficial.  Well, I caught the ending of the movie on cable recently, then couldn't wait to view it again, which I did (several times).  This is one of the most moving films I have ever seen, and I've seen some intense movers and shakers.<br /><br />It's a given when a film features talent like Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman you are going to get excellent performances.  And both actors deliver:  Freeman as a lifelong mechanic whose true ambitions were thwarted by circumstances; the irascible Nicholson as a curmudgeonly tycoon.  Both characters are suddenly thrown together by terminal illnesses, yet through all the turmoil and heartache a fast friendship develops.  The friction between them as they first meet, the adventures they share as they go through their respective "Bucket Lists", make up the movie's most comedic scenes.  The skydiving scene, in particular, was very effective for me, as it was readily apparent both Freeman and Nicholson were actually freefalling through the air during the scene.<br /><br />The actors themselves could have kicked the bucket.<br /><br />Yet the ending was what moved me the most.  Because we as the audience have developed an attachment to the characters, it becomes very difficult to watch as they meet their respective fates.  The interaction between the two in the end--the total and complete way each man has made a change, for the better, in his friend's life--makes for one incredibly poignant climax.  THE BUCKET LIST covers the full range of emotions; easily one of the best bittersweet movies in many years.  Highly recommended.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

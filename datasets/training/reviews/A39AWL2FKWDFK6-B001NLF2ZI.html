<meta name="summary" content="African based political intrigue"></head><body><p>Director Sydney Pollack abetted by accomplished actors, Oscar winners, Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman collaborated on an underrated taut political thriller based on events surrounding the United Nations.<br /><br />The U.N. General Assembly is about to be visited by President Zuwanee, despotic leader of the fictious African country of Matoba, who will plead against possible sanctions.  Zuwanee ascended to lead his country and was praised as a savior but soon his administration degenerated into a policy of racial genocide.<br /><br />U.N. interpreter Silvia Broome, played by Kidman, a native of Matoba inadvertantly overhears an assassination plot against Zuwanne through her headphones at a time the building was being evacuated for security reasons.  She reports the conversation to authorities and within short order Secret Service agent Tobin Keller played by a haggard looking Sean Penn commences an investigation.  Penn and partner Dot Woods played by Catherine Keener work in a division responsible for security for foreign dignitaries.<br /><br />Penn must investigate Kidman to ascertain the veracity of her claim.  As he digs deeper events surrounding the arrival of Zuwanee point more and more to the possibility of terrorism.  Penn also soon learns that Kidman's radical political past give her ample motivation to be involved in the plot.<br /><br />Pollack did a fine job in creating a multi layered film that was both topical and relevant.  The cinematography shot in both Africa and the concrete jungles surrounding the United Nations was outstanding showing both squalor and high tech.</p></body></html>

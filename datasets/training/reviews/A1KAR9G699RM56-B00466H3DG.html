Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) decide to erase their memories of each other, but at the last moment Joel realizes that he wants to save his treasured memories.<br /><br />After that, the whole film revolves around the idea of love that was meant to be.  No it is not perfect love, but it is about two people coming together and enjoying one anthers company.  There are tough times and good times, but only too late do they realize that all memories should be protected.<br /><br />I found this movie to be a highly original telling of not just the traditional love story, but the difficult ones, and the sad ones too.  The actors do a marvelous job of portraying daily life, and the director Michel Gondry, along with Kaufman's script, does a wonderful job of illuminating those everyday moments.<br /><br />I especially liked the idea that things revolve, and return, and are in a sense reborn.  The memory eraser company seems like science on the cutting edge; however, ethical dilemmas and personal endangerment highlight this as a man vs. machine theme too.  Therefore, the movie is not all just about love.  (In fact one of my favorite parts is the internal conflict in the memory erasing business itself.)<br /><br />In summary, if you like artsy, or creative films, with everyday themes then you will really like this film.</p></body></html>

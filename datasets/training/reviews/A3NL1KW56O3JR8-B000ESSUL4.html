<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing"></head><body><p>A dull retelling of the Pocahontas story.  The whole movie is rather strange without much really happening.  It was, however, nice to see them get away from the more stereotypical portrayals of Native Americans.  The only saving grace is the cinematography--plus, I like Colin Farrell.  Overall, a big disappointment.</p></body></html>

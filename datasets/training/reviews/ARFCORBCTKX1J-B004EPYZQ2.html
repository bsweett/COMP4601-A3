<meta name="summary" content="derivative and disappointing"></head><body><p>I've been watching movies for 60 years, and there's little I haven't seen. For me, an "old" movie is a silent film ("Orphans of the Storm").<br /><br />Movie makers seem to think that, despite the wide availability of decades of films on home video, they can get away with recycling stuff most viewers have seen. This is the case with "Super 8", a rough mash-up of "ET", "CE3K", and "Jurassic Park". Had these films never been made, "Super 8" would come off as agreeably original. But when all the viewer can do is think of how much "Super 8" reminds him of //other// films, something is wrong.<br /><br />"Super 8"'s worst problem is that it depends too heavily on coincidence and obvious foreshadowing. When one of the young film makers displays a proclivity for lighting small fireworks, you //know// it's going to come in handy later. And why is it that the train //just happens// to pass near the community where the man who tries to stop it resides?<br /><br />Spoiler follows.<br /><br />The obvious question of why the Air Force is moving the alien and his paraphernalia is never answered. A plausible explanation is that they're finally going to let him leave. If so, the events of the film are highly ironic. The "bad guys" aren't quite so bad, while the "good guy" is the person who incites the tragedy. Had "Super 8" included this revelation, I'd probably have given it four stars.<br /><br />Michael Giacchino's score is a dud. It comes off as watered-down Williams -- which might have been his intent, a subtle slap at the film itself.<br /><br />In short, "by the numbers" movie making. J J Abrams should be ashamed -- and ought to take a refresher course from Robert McKee.<br /><br />PS: A note to the costume department... In a film with millions of dollars of special effects, the wig for the guy playing the hippie salesman is incomprehensibly awful. The "part" in the wig appears to be a part of the wig -- not hair growing out of his scalp. John Wayne had better hairpieces 50+ years ago, and Robert Duvall's "do" for "Lonesome Dove" is undetectable (other than looking overly neat), even on Blu-ray. That film had a budget that would've barely covered the catering for "Super 8".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Still a Good Popcorn Film"></head><body><p>ID4 set multiplexes on fire when it was released on July, 1996, mainly due to its irresistible trailer and word-of-mouth hype.  And while the majority of viewers dismissed it as a cliched alien-invasion film, I still stand as one of its defenders.  For sure, it doesn't hold a candle to &quot;Close Encounters...,&quot; but it's still a watchable, above-average flick despite its hokey touches.  The plot is simple: aliens come to earth and destroy major cities around the US (If you haven't seen the picture of the White House blown to bits, you clearly don't get out much).  The president (a Clinton-esque Bill Bullman) calls upon military services to fight these creatures.  That's when a bigshot Marine (Will Smith) comes in to save the day.  That's the plot in a nutshell.  The special effects are good but not great, and the suspense leading to the attack keeps the viewer glued to the story.  Trust me, I have seen far worse &quot;event&quot; summer movies that are doubly unoriginal and rely on cliches that are just as tired.  Yet, ID4 overall succeeds because it doesn't take itself all that seriously.  If you're in the mood for mindless entertainment, this will do.  It's far more interesting than anything Jerry Bruckheimer will ever produce.</p></body></html>

Greed, paranoia, religion, false pride, dishonor, deception, control, corruption, abandonment, and murder are primary in the life of an early day oilman played by LEWIS. Not pleasant, BRUTAL but entirely RIVETING. A WORLD WIDE AWARD WINNER. BRILLIANTLY DIRECTED by Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights). GREAT CINEMA</p></body></html>

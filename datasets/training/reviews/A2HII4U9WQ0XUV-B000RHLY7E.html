That's fine. Imagine yourself down on your knees, with some maniac with a sack over his writhing, roiling, insane mutant features standing over and behind you, arcing the baseball bat up into the air. You try to brace yourself, but you really can't. Not for that. The Louisville slugger screams down through the air, and smashes into your skull, and the shock of the blow alone drives the blood spraying out of your eyes, your nostrils, your mouth.<br /><br />You feeling the blood rush to your face in sympathy? Good. That's what "The Devil's Rejects" is like: a nasty, brutal, psycopathic, happily, laughingly evil monster of a movie that takes a little Alabama ironwood and smashes your skull wide open.<br /><br />Let me introduce the Devil's Rejects: so Evil even Satan wouldn't have them.<br /><br />Now: you live in a world that says it's alright, you can travel by day, the Monsters live in the dark, in the shadows. And you're good: so God will guide you, kiss your daughters before they sleep at night, light your way with a column of smoke by day and a pillar of fire by night.<br /><br />And all that other mumbo-jumbo horsesh*t that's supposed to keep the night terrors away. And let's say you're the unfortunate young balladeer of Mom & Pop country-folk songsters "Banjo & Sullivan", traveling across West Texas with your young wife, your harpy mother-in-law, your banjo-strumming father-in-law Sullivan, and you decide to hole up in a do-drop-Inn fleabag with running water and a minimum of cockroaches, just for the night, just between gigs.<br /><br />Is your God gonna protect you from the Monsters that walk by daytime?<br /><br />From the three froth-jawed demons on the high prairie, slaughtering, torturing, killing, raping? Like the Lizard King would have said: Killers on the Road, and their brains really *are* squirming like a toad.<br /><br />"The Devil's Rejects" may very well be the most vicious film in American history---ever.<br /><br />Rob Zombie has distilled, fermented, brewed up the raw evil of "House of 1,000 Corpses", let it sit, stew, breathe, and then served up a potent White Lightning of terror. "The Devil's Rejects" is certainly a contender for the most brutal American movie ever made.<br /><br />It's also as simple and clean as an axe-wound: stacking the bodies of your victims like cordwood in the basement doesn't fly even in remotest Texas, so a loaded-for-bear police assault team under the command of Sheriff Wydel---whose brother George was murdered by the Fireflys---show up at Chez Firefly, blast a few of the clan, lose the rest, and come away with Mama Firefly as their prize.<br /><br />The survivors---Baby (Sherri Moon) and Otis (Bill Moseley)---steal a car and, after a pleasant afternoon of wilding, slaughter, rape, torture, mutiliation, dismemberment and killing, manage to hook up with their doting funnyman dad, the pancake-makeup wearing killer clown Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig).<br /><br />From there they go on the lam from the Law, planning to lay low for a while at a whorehouse run by buddy and kingpimp Charlie Altamount (Ken Foree). They are unaware that they're pursued across the high desert by lawman Wydell, riding his men and a pair of bounty hunters---the Unholy Two (Danny Trejo & Diamond Dallas Page)---and whipping and driving them after the remaining sh*tbags who killed his brother.<br /><br />You know, to do the Lord's work. Or the Devil's. Whatever.<br /><br />Now, there are two things that struck me about "Devil's Rejects": Point #1:It's a Monster movie. It's shot like a Monster movie, the camerawork shot, mostly, from the perspective of the victims.<br /><br />That goes double for sympathy: there is no one here to root for. While this is a road-trip down Hell's asphalt, and like any road-trip you're gonna bond with your funny new buddies---Baby, Otis, and the Captain. But that should never confuse you that your cracking-wise and well-armed new amigos are also monsters. Monsters that eat children, that rape old women, that crucify the weak and the unlucky.<br /><br />Zombie, remarkably, never stoops to make the Firefly clan heroes. His Otis is a windswept Biblical prophet gone rabid and eating carrion: try to stop the shivers when those graveyard-blue feral eyes draw down on a victim, staring out from a windblown mass of matted dirty-blond hair. Yeah, Baby Firefly can drop a man dead with that witchy smile (and Sherri Moon owns every inch of her character and crackles with psychopathic charisma)---but she's a killer.<br /><br />And Spaulding, cackling, old coot Spaulding, is the biggest Monster of them all: the Monster who breeds monsters.<br /><br />They're wild dogs; they deserve to die. And that leads us to Point #2: Monster Huntin' is Dangerous Business. Two words: Sheriff Wydell. While the Fireflys go on a literal road-tripping killing spree, Wydell (Forsythe) is on a one-way trip to the Dark Night of the Soul. It's astonishing just how perfect Forsythe is with his role, what a worthy foe he becomes in the face of the bloodthirsty clan---a kind of 20th century Doc Holliday, half wild-eyed revenant, half fire & brimstone preacher. It's also a testament to Forsythe's skill that he can hold his own in a flick teeming with killer performances---and a testament to Zombie's craft that the man backs off and gives the Sheriff some room to breathe and come to life.<br /><br />'Rejects is unreal. Insane. Diabolical. Wallowing in blood. Possibly evil. And most of all, proves: Hell *really* is other people.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

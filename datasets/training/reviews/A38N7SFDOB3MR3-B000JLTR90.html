<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant. Entrancing. 98 out of 100"></head><body><p>I didn't know what to expect when I decided to watch Lady in the Water. I had loved Signs, but stayed away from the Village at the request of a friend. So, the movie began...and I was stunned.<br /><br />Few movies have made me want to watch them again, immediately. Few movies leave me dozing off at night thinking about them. the Lady in the Water did both.<br /><br />The acting was wonderful, and the story was refreshing, fun and completely engrossing. The Lady in the Water was a work of art. It's a film that I shouldn't have liked, but ended up in love with. It's a film that makes no sense, but makes all the sense in the world. An adult fairy tale? How insane, right?<br /><br />The Lady in the Water is like a good painting or piece of music...you can't often describe WHY you love it, but after it is done, you want to view/listen again. Few movies carry this artistic weight. It is a weight better suited to describe the music genre.<br /><br />The Lady in The Water is a must see. It is comforting and warm, just like your favorite security blanket or stuffed friend.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 798<br /><br />50 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />9 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br /><br />10 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?<br /><br />9 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?<br /><br />10 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?<br /><br />10 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?</p></body></html>

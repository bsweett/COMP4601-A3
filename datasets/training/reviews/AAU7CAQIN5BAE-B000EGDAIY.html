<meta name="summary" content="Bill Pullman and Sarah Michelle Gellar equals DISASTER"></head><body><p>As the lights were put out in the apartment and the sweet smells of popcorn emminated from within, the friends all gathered on the floor and couches to finally watch 'The Grudge', all in Hi-Def and PG-13 so the studios can rack in the loot from the kiddie pools, and share moments of sheer terror with each other and rekindle old nostalgia reminiscent of Exorcist, Poltergeist or the like...<br /><br />...a couple of chills<br />...a few laughs<br />...and how completely we were in agreement that Bill Pullman is one of the most wooden, phony, tangibly boring actors in the industry.<br /><br />I don't recall if it was a Dimension Type Film Disaster, if it wasn't it certainly should have been. I mean I understand the idea behind it, but let's make it a little more non predictable. Oh boy at door, oh no shadow going by clouded window, oh my noises in house when no ones around, oh no look in attic... Leave house, go back to house, people dead in house, go back again to house, cops in house, cops that know about previous murders in house, head cop goes back to house, head cop dies in house, other cops go back to house, boyfriend goes to house, Michelle-untalented-Gellar goes to house again, but wait didn't she leave...yes, yes she left, but she isn't in THAT house, but she is, on the stairs but it's not the same house she went into, because she went back in time to the same house that isn't that house she went into originally because it's the house where the first murders took place which by all relative standards is that same house...(phew)<br /><br />Some of the effects were pretty damn brilliant, [scary spectre thingy with tentacles in corner of room et all] but all in all, the masses who say this was scary as heck, is understandable, because you could easily be frightened, I guess. Fun, but not for me. A sure classic for the Myspace generation.<br /><br />Scary: no<br />Fun: sure<br />Should it be in your collection next to The Shining or Something Wicked This Way Comes: absolutely not</p></body></html>

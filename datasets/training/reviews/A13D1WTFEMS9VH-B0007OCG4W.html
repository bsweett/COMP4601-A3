<meta name="summary" content="Sex, Lies, and Natalie Portman"></head><body><p>I must confess, I've never quite understood all the hoopla surrounding Julia Roberts. She is, to me, at best only slightly above average looking. I've never been particularly floored by her acting, either, since she seems to always be playing the same character: Julia Roberts. In this movie, it is beyond my comprehension that anyone would leave Natalie Portman for her. What is her overwhelming appeal supposed to be here, exactly?<br /><br />With that said, I was initially unsure if I even liked this movie. However, as it went on I found myself pulled into the tangled web of lies and deceit surrounding the lives of these people. Then there's Natalie in a highly erotic scene as a private dancer for Clive Owen... This scene is so steamy you'll need to run a dehumidifier while watching it!<br /><br />Love, lust, lies, loss... Life. If there wasn't something here that felt basically true, both about relationships and what they reveal about ourselves, the movie would have failed. But there is something -- indeed, much.</p></body></html>

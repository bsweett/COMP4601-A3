<meta name="summary" content=""You Enjoyed it! I Swear!""></head><body><p>Take an emotinally unstable over-achiever mother<br /><br />Add a drunken mom . . .<br /><br />An Insecure Cook with heart . . .<br /><br />and a no-english speaking spanish  maid and you got yourself a fresh comedy in the tradition of AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Written by the same man who directed AS GOOD AS IT GETS.<br /><br />This Dramedy acomplishes what so few have tried. A little taste of how embarassing it is to not know a language.<br /><br />But this one movie has heart. Adam Sandler flexes his dramatic funny bone here and leaves room for the others to develop.<br /><br />the whole movie is told through the eyes of the maid's daughter via an essay to a college that she wants to go to where she tells the story of how her mother had trouble adapting to one family's life style.<br /><br />Adam sandler plays the sympathetic Father who is all for making his children happy. He recently transferred from a high 4 star resturant to a lower class one. But, after the mom realizes that she can't handle everything around the house, she decides to hire a maid. The maid knows only a little bit of english . . . which is a classic tool for comedy. The comedy of Misunderstanding someone.<br /><br />After repeated problems, and under control of the nutso mom, adam sandler's character shines and is able to rise above the rest, even having a touching scene with the maid.<br /><br />The dvd has some special features but the one that really gets the taste buds tingling is a way to make THE WORLD'S GREATEST SANDWHICH. The sandwhich that adam sandler eats in the film. He was taught how to make it by a chef who was training him on the film.<br /><br />Final Verdict: Lives up to AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Should really be called - IT GETS EVEN BETTER!<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></body></html>

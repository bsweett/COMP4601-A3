<meta name="summary" content="The Matrix Reloaded (Widescreen Edition)"></head><body><p>The Matrix Reloaded (Widescreen Edition) is the 2003 sequel to Matrix and is just as good. The storyline is very intelligently written and raises many ethical and philosophical questions. Science fiction films that it can be compared with are Brazil and Blade Runner. The special effects are tremendous and Kenau Reeves is great in the role as Neo. The soundtrack is uneven with some tracks being great and some so so. I can not wait to see the final and concluding part of the amazing Matrix series. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.</p></body></html>

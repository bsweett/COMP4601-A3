V chilling and cool in his Guy Fawkes mask, his heavy throwing knives, his superhuman fighting ability, his ability to pit his enemies against each other, and his conniving to throw the whole rotten country into anarchy and revolution. What an appropriate message for the mass media! Natalie Portman is not very charismatic in the film, despite getting top billing, with Hugo Weaving enchanting merely throughout the power of his voice and his body language (he's masked throughout). Great movie, really splendid. I have read the graphic novel, and now want to read it again.</p></body></html>

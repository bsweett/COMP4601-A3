<meta name="summary" content="Menace"></head><body><p>This was an unpleasant surprise - its a very good film.<br />It doesn't have the same gut level horror as Silence of the lambs, but there are nevertheless some nerve shredding moments.<br />The cast are all good and if Julianne Moore isn't quite as good as Jodie Foster, shes very close.<br />The other reason this film is a success is because of director Ridley Scott. The settings in Florence are stunning and the whole look of the film is great. Ridley Scott always had a great eye for visuals!<br />OK so the very end is a bit unlikely, but this film will keep you entertained, and holds up to repeated viewings. You should be able to pick this up cheap now, if so buy it!</p></body></html>

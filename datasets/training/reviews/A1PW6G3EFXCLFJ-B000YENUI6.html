<meta name="summary" content="PROMISES DELIVERED"></head><body><p>With quality acting performances all around, EASTERN PROMISES delivers a taut story about the Russian mafia. Viggo Mortensen plays the chauffer/bodyguard to the alcoholic son of a Russian mob chief, the elder wishing to keep certain deeds secret. A diary pops up with incriminating facts and the plot cranks up like the motorbike that female interest Naomi Watts rides around town, trying to find a home for the baby of an abused underage girl. But, for me, the plot is secondary to the interesting peek into another world, a world of hard Russian criminals, speaking half Russian and half accented English, some having escaped from the KGB in their homeland, and wearing tattoos like dark graphic novels about their past trials and affliations. There is a brutal fight scene that is flinchingly violent but, for the most part, the violence is implied in a glance or a word. Certain to be a classic of crime noir.</p></body></html>

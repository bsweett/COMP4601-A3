<meta name="summary" content="So-So"></head><body><p>This was a so-so romance comedy. It is certainly not my favorite genre. I have liked many of Jack Nicholson's movies, but my wife has not (excepting &quot;As Good As It Gets&quot;, which Nicholson shows a lot of the same acting in this movie). Nothing great, nothing bad, very predictable, everyone is well-mannered, etc. Just too blah for me.</p></body></html>

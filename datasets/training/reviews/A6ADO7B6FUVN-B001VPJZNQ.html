However, Beck dislikes his job and wants to get out of it and open a restaurant as he is also somewhat of a culinary expert and gourmet chef.  Beck accepts one last job where he is asked to bring home his boss's son, Travis (Seann William Scott),  who has stepped on the wrong feet and caused some problems.  Beck flies to South America's jungles where Travis is searching for the mythical Gato del Diablo, which is estimated to be worth millions on the black market.<br /><br />Rundown is a fast paced action comedy where jokes are thrown out as quickly as bullets are fired and Kung-Fu kicks are delivered.  Underneath the silly humor and punches there is a MTV-like seriousness about exploitation of poverty in poor countries where injustices are as frequent as fast food joints are in the suburban United States.  The cinematic experience is enhanced with the vibrant colors and the excellent cinematography as it offers a swift and entertaining cinematic experience.</p></body></html>

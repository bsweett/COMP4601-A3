Its successor, Reloaded, seemed perfunctory after that - the same again, with the volume turned up. This third Matrix rises nearly to the level of the first Matrix's novelty.<br /><br />Novelty, by definition, can't be a repetition. This time, it comes from a pervasive combination of live action with computer animation. The animation is outstanding - hugely complex scenes, with hundreds or thousands of separate robotic characters. The dim-lit, robotic cityscapes create a grim sense of scale and majesty. Best, though, was what the director chose not to animate, the human figures. Animation can't yet produce the subtlety and expression of human actors, so no attempt was made to synthesize them. Instead, elaborate compositing combined real actors with computer-graphic sets and props. It's the best, and certainly the most complex example to date of the merged techniques. Enjoyable extras on the second disk show how the actors played their parts in this movie - showing that acting is a whole different craft than it used to be.<br /><br />This is a definite end to the Matrix franchise, a satisfying resolution of the basic conflict that's driven the series. I guess there's still room for prequels and such. Any sequels would have to have such different premises from this trilogy that they'd hardly be recognizable. I'm very glad to see the series end on such a high note.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

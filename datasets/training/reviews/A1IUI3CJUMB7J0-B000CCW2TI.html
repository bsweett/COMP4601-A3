The story is satisfing about a women who is terized on a plane by an madman who is ploting an assasion. The film is suspensfull but we all know what the outcome will be i the end but it's a thriller. The acting is the greates thing about this thriller Rachel McAddems is great and Cillan Murphy is great. The directing is great. Overall it's a good suspensfull film that should entertain all.</p></body></html>

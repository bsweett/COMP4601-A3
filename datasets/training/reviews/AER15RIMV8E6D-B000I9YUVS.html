<meta name="summary" content="The Fog is Back!!!"></head><body><p>This time, John Carpenter and Debra Hill helped produce the remake of their horror classic. Also, it seems more for teenagers than for adults. The original seemed like an adult horror movie, rather than teens, because they get Tom Welling to play Nick Castle, Maggie Grace, and DeRay Davis to appeal to younger viewers. I wanted to watch the original and the remake back-to-back, and I think the original is better because it's scarier. This one is okay. Some people may find it boring. If you like remakes, you might like THE FOG!!!</p></body></html>

The common factor between the two films are that they are both about how men treat women. In this case, it is how an older man would treat a younger women, or vice versa. Or, that is how I thought of it as. Jack Nicolson and Diane Keaton star, and Keaton has a performace that is Oscar worthy all the way. I felt that way even before the nominations came out, and I still feel that way. I saw the film twice already, and have decided to voice my mind over it now. <p>Jack Nicolson stars as Harry Sandborn, the owner of a successful hip hop label, and a person who dates women under 30. The only thing is, he is 63. His newest girlfriend is Marin, and the two go off to her mothers beach house for the weekend. It is supposed to be empty, so the two are surprised when Marin's mother Erika, and her sister Zoe show up. Erika is a playwright who wants to come for the peace and quiet so that she could write. She instantly doesn't approve of her daughter's relationship with Harry. The four decide to stay at the house, untill Harry has a sudden heart attack. The doctor helping him, Julian Mercer, is a big fan of Erika's work. But when releasing Harry, he falls onto the ground, causing Julian to not let him travel for a couple of days. The only place for him to stay is the beach house, and that does not sit well with Erika. When Marin returns to work, Erika and Harry find themselves alone with each other, and complete opposites. But as they are alone, they relize that they have much more in common than they thought. And when Marin and Harry break up, romantic feelings begin to develop between Harry and Erika, but problems arise when it becomes clear that Julian wants to become involved with Erika, and Harry does not want to switch his lifestyle when it comes to women.<p>The only reason that I gave "Something's Gotta Give" four stars was because of the last few scenes. I don't want to ruin what happens, but I don't feel that it should have ended the way it did. It started as a great, orignal, hilarious comedy, and then by the end just became another one of those predictable comedies that stick with a formula. That's why I liked the beginning. It wasn't formula. But the end was. Although it only got four stars, I do consider "Something's Gotta Give" one of the most notable films of last year, and it was a good enough movie to see in the theatres, and see more then once. I really did like it, and Keaton should get an Oscar. This movie is fun from start to finish.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated PG-13 sexual content, brief nudity and strong language.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sentimental Highway"></head><body><p>Pixar's last collaboration with Disney turns out to be a sweetly sentimental picture about days gone by - about the fast pace of the present leaving behind the "simpler" days of bygone years.<br /><br />"Cars" is the interesting final act in a marriage between the most original maker of animated pictures and the marketing behemoth better know for its tried, trite and formulaic films. The film is completely predictable. Once we are introduced to self-sufficient, arrogant racecar "Lightning McQueen," only the most obtuse of viewers could fail to predict that he will somehow learn the requisite lessons that 1) We All Must Rely On Others and 2) We Must All Slow Down To See The Beauty Arounf Us. Add a love interest, a motley collection  of oddballs and a bitter old racer who has turned his back on his old love of racing, and you have a potential carnival of clich&eacute;s. But "Cars" pretty much gets past banality to deliver a movie that is breathtaking to watch, often funny and almost moving.<br /><br />"Cars" waxes rhapsodic about the pre-interstate experience of driving in which the journey, not the destination, was most important. The film adulates the old Route 66, with its neon-emblazoned motels, gas stations and drive-ins. It should probably not shock anyone that these establishments could be ugly, uncomfortable and lonely in their own right. But "Cars" lets us see their beautiful side, in which they catered to the basic needs of travelers of the 1950s and 60s while reflecting the values of their era.<br /><br />Animated or not, "Cars" is a crashing bore for the little kids. The soundtrack veers too much toward mawkishness, and the languid vistas conjured up by the filmmakers are too glorious for small minds. There's too much story, too much unfathomable nostalgia and not enough racing. The kids in the theater where I saw the film were losing their minds.<br /><br />But for those of us with a bit of wear on our tires, "Cars" gets us where we want to go - a few minutes rest from the hustle-bustle of the Highway We Call Life.</p></body></html>

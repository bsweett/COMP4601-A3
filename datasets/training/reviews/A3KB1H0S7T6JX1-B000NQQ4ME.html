<meta name="summary" content="A movie worth watching!"></head><body><p>Apocalypto takes us back to the Americas right before the arrival of the Spaniards in 1492.  The film sheds light on the exotic Mayan civilization as it brings to the screen the tale of a young man captured during a raid, who tries to escape from his captors in order to get home where he has left his wife and child helpless and vulnerable.<br />The movie follows a pragmatic and realistic account of life in the Americas in the 15th Century.  The film brings to the screen two main stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: On the one hand, Jaguar Paw, and his quest of returning home to save his family, and on the other (and to a lesser extent), the deteriorating conditions (civil war, decadence, disease, drought, corruption) which led to the decline of the Mayan civilization and its eventual demise at the hands of the Spanish Conquistadors.<br />The cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!<br />The setting (!), the dialogues, the language (!), the music, and the costumes are all wonderful!<br />Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought-provoking movie that will definitely provide for an evening's entertainment.<br />In short, Apocalypto is a film you should seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)!</p></body></html>

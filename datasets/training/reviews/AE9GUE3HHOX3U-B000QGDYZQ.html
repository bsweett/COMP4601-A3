They both gave wooden portrayals of their characters, leaving you feeling empty inside.  Julian McMahon came across as a primadonna, all the while I was thinking "honey you're not that cute, get over yourself".  The plot was all too confusing and had me lost most of the time, and at certain points I stopped caring about whatever happened. I couldn't wait for it to end, this movie was painful to watch.</p></body></html>

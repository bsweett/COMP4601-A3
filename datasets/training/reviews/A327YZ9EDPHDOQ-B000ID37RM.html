<meta name="summary" content="Gregory Peck's greatest role!"></head><body><p>2008 marks 45 years when this movie came to theatres everywhere. 45 years later the movie still stands the test of time for its acting, its story and proving once and for all there are lots of great movies and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is one of them! Gregory Peck delivered a first class role as Atticus Finch. The DVD also has some wonderful extras including Mary Badham with her relationship with Gregory Peck during the filming. This movie is definitely a classic for everyone to watch!!</p></body></html>

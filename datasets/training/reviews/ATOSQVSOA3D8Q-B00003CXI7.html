It isn't an horror movie, it sort of gets you a bit frightened in places, not as it is scary though [where you get wandering on what is going to happen sort of thing} It is all about, well most of it is where a woman finds out truth of something of her husband,  won't tell you else i'll ruin the film for you, see it!!</p></body></html>

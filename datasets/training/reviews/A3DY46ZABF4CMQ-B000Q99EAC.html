<meta name="summary" content="Rocky Balboa triumphs!"></head><body><p>Cue the music! Rocky Balboa, the most beloved onscreen character and highly anticipated sequel of the the year, is back!<br /><br />Written and directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone in the role that made him a movie star, Rocky Balboa, like the title character, triumphs. This film could end up being the surprise hit of the year.<br /><br />16 years have passed since the last Rocky movie, part 5 that is, Rocky is now a widow; Adrian has been dead for nearly 3 years (Talia Shire appears only in flashbacks). It's a walk down memory lane in the first third of the film as Rocky visits the places he and Adrian met and went to in their early days accompanied by Paulie who dreads the annual ritual because it reminds him of how bad he was to his sister. When he's not touring the sites, Rocky is sitting at Adrian's grave pondering what's left of his own life.<br /><br />Rocky has closed the doors of Mickey's gym, and is now the owner of a local restaurant named after his late wife. Rocky goes around the restarant every now and then, telling customers stories of his glory days. One of his regular patrons is Spider Rico, the guy he fought and defeated in the opening minutes of the original Rocky. Another old face in the neighborhood Rocky bumps into is 'little' Marie, the girl who once told him "Screw you, Creepo" after walking her home and giving her advice on how to live her life. She ends up being a pivotal character in Rocky's post-Adrian life. She even reminds him of Adrian with her encouragement, and support. However, their relationship does not evolve into romance, which is quite understandable.<br /><br />Rocky is in pain. He's old and lonely. He regains the passion to fight again to unleash the 'beast' that is still inside of him. His son, played by Milo Ventimiglia, is striving to find his place in the corporate world but can't escape dad's shadow; and as a result despises his father's decision to return to the ring. Things get heated up when ESPN airs a computer generated fight between the new champ Mason The Line Dixon, played by real life boxr Antonio Tarver, who is disregarded by the boxing community as a phony, and Rocky. Computer says that Rocky would win by knockout. This causes a stir with the press and fans, and gives both Dixon and Rocky the chance to prove their worthiness.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa succeeds in exploring Rocky's inner feelings at his old age. The scene where Rocky expresses that he still has 'stuff in the basement' to Paulie is extremely convincing, especially when the grieving Rocky breaks down in tears. There's also the scene where Rocky angrily refutes the Boxing Commission's refusal to renew his boxing license, a scene so intense, many members in the audience cheered. It's a powerful performance by Sly that will leave audiences wondering why this man has never had the chance to evolve properly as a character actor. Oscar, anyone?<br /><br />The climactic fight scene at the end is incredible. Even the commentator in the movie says he can't believe he is only moments away from watching Rocky fight again. That's exactly the same feeling I had. When the fight did begin, I was literally on the edge of my seat. Stallone's directing is so precise that Rocky's final round, both in the ring and on the movie screens, goes down in style.<br /><br />Would I pay to watch it again?<br /><br />Yo, absolutely!<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A-</p></body></html>

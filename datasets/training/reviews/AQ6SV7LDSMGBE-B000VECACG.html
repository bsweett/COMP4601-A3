<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Movie-Great DVD"></head><body><p>I was really surprised how well this film held up.  A marvelous movie with marvelous DVD extras.  Don't be surprised if the ending is different than you remember.  This is actually the ORIGINAL ending to the film, not the ending that Spielberg was persuaded to put on the &quot;Special Edition&quot; re-release of the movie.  The other ending is contained in the special features, if you miss it.</p></body></html>

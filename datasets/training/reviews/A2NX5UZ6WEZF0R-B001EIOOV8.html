<meta name="summary" content="Best mob movie ever!"></head><body><p>Without deniro and pesci this film would not have worked. Their characters absent in a mob movie is like a gun without bullets. I can watch this movie over and over and still be entertained and inrtigued. I think Joe Pesci did a way better job in Casino than he did in goodfellas because even though both characters are ruthless, casino "nicky" had a softer side than tommy in goodfellas. Sharon Stone cheese and rice, gave an oscar winning performance as deniro's wife who pretty much has a breakdown and turns into an addict, alcoholioc, and raving lunatic. Wouldnt you if you married to a controlling richie who has mob ties. She was gorgeous at the beginning with her long blonde hair, and 70's outfits and hair do. But of course as her character changed into an alcy and addict she lost her looks a little. Just a little reminder of what alcohol and drugs do to your body. And Robert Deniro was smoking hot! This was one of his last movies where he still looked great for his age. He is older now, but still looks pretty good. He's one of those guys that never loses his sex appeal.</p></body></html>

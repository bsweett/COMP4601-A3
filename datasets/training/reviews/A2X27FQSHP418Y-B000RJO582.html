<meta name="summary" content="Breathtaking action / horror movie."></head><body><p>This movie takes from the first minute and never let you go until its (unfortunate and unpredictable) sad ending.<br /><br />If you never watched the original movie, then you'll be able to feel comfortable to enjoy this as one of the most amazing action / horror flicks of recent years. The action is unstoppable, the characters are good, acting is good, special effects are good, there aren't so much plot holes (altough they're inevitable in such a kind of movies...). Comparison with the previous movie will make no good,they're completely different things.<br /><br />There is gore,no doubt about that. There are clichec characters, but the director does an amzing job of giving them some deepness with the time has has at his disposal. Also, director Snyder, a music video director, did not use blinding fast edition to disguise the bad movie he was shooting. No. He believed in the script, so he directed it properly.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie. It had glued me in my seat, and I really cared for the characters, even if they were a dozen more than in the original movie.<br /><br />Breathtaking. The sense of coming doom that slowly goes through your senses is somehting I've seldom felt in movies, the sense that, no matter what these guys do, they will die. The director passed this message slowly, with each passing sense.</p></body></html>

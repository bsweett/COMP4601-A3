<meta name="summary" content="A McCandless in the Wind"></head><body><p>I knew what the general subject of this film was going in. What I hadn't been prepared for was how much of this young man's emotional journey paralleled that of so many people I've known. You'll also likely to be surprised to see your friends, yourself, in this rebellion.<br /><br />Of course, the people you've known probably didn't go quite so fatefully far in distancing themselves from all the cluttering "stuff" of urban society. But surely, we're all acquainted with young people who vanished into their own worlds, at least for a while - leaving their parents to anguish over their whereabouts. And this movie will probably also make a lot of viewers realize how many young people they've known who, like Chris McCandless, silently suffered from, resented, and actually loathed, the essential lack of love between their parents - who rebelled against their parents' fractured, messy marital backgrounds. "Into the Wild" underscores the often-repeated wisdom that the greatest gift parents can give their children - is not things, and in fact not even first-and-foremost a doting love of those children - but an abiding love for each other.<br /><br />Clearly though, McCandless cut family ties without being sufficiently prepared to survive in the wilderness. More than his lack of knowledge about hunting for animals and edible plants, he had an unfortunate lack of knowledge about Thoreau, the spiritual mentor whom he was following into solitude. When I myself was once rhapsodizing about Thoreau's philosophy, a friend of mine deflated my admiration slightly by telling me that Walden was actually just a stone's throw away from Thoreau's family house, and that Thoreau's mother came out to his cabin frequently, with meals and cookies she'd baked for him - and probably also to do his laundry. I wanted to shout at the screen to McCandless to heed this seldom-mentioned aspect of Thoreau's retreat into nature. Thoreau was definitely working with a net.<br /><br />Despite the tragedy though, this movie is truly life-affirming. In contrast with so many movies made now where there is really no one to like - here everyone is a hearteningly decent, likable person. McCandless didn't encounter one sociopathic serial killer on the road - almost unheard of in recent decades. Hal Holbrook does an exceptionally brilliant, touching turn as an older man who briefly serves as a way-station for McCandless. Although Holbrook's role is barely more than a cameo appearance, it's a portrayal that will undoubtedly stick in your memory as one of the most poignant ever captured on film.<br /><br />The whole movie is brilliantly photographed. Director Sean Penn never allowed any artiness to interfer with the sheer natural beauty of McCandless' journey.</p></body></html>

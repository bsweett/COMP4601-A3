<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie!"></head><body><p>Classic man against nature conflict.  Nature wins every time.  I love this movie!  It's witty, funny, and action packed.  The dinosaurs look so real;it's amazing.  Even their movements looked realistic.  Whenever the cable goes out, this is the movie I watch.  I believe it has the best plot and storyline of any of the Jurassic Park movies.  This is a great movie even after all this time.</p></body></html>

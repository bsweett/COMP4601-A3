<meta name="summary" content="It was entertaining, but not great."></head><body><p>A semi-stylish, only-okay action/monster movie with a muddled plot about werewolves-vs.-vampires and stuff.  It's okay, though: the film moves fairly fast, and Kate Beckinsale looks great in all those tight leather/vinyl jumpsuits.  It's no &quot;Buffy The Vampire Slayer,&quot; but it was okay for a no-brainer rental.  It was lame, though, that so much of the action was just people -- um, I mean, monsters -- standing around shooting a bunch of automatic rifles and pistols... We already see plenty of that in all the non-monster movies; didn't need it here so much.</p></body></html>

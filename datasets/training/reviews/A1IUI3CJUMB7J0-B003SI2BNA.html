The movie tanked at the box office and the trailers did not look good but I wanted to see it to see if it was scary and it was not. The movie is on the boarder lione of beeing a good movie and a bad movie. The good stuff the acting is good, the story is ok and it builds up lots making you think there will be scary moments and a good ending but your wrong. The movie builds up to nothing it's just a dissapointing ending. There are many pointltss parts and charactors to this movie. It's not scary and not worth the watch.</p></body></html>

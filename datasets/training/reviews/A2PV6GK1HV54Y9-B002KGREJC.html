Page is a talented actress, Juno came across immature at first but the character truly grows up before the viewers eyes. Michael Cera and Jennifer Garner really surprised me here, they hold their own around Page's dry wit. The dialogue is something else, you gotta hear it to believe it! And by the way a film cannot make you pregnant, so let's just set that myth straight. I highly recommend this too cool for its own good flick, enjoy!</p></body></html>

I liked her. is this the only strong point of this movie? no it's not! this is one of the best time thrillers I've ever seen. In contrary with some people thoughts, It's not a suspense horror or a real thriller movie although it's not a drama too. best term for this movie is "Science Fiction". whatever, it was perfect and defectless. scenario was very accurate and cliffhanging! actings were brilliant. Torturing brody in that lunatic assylum really made sense and made me change my belief that assylum is better than prison. me, myself if someday stand behind a court for murder trial. prefer not to pretend that I was a maniac and accept the punishment, whatever i'll be, execution or long time prison! assylum is the worst atonement that anyone can get!<br /><br />the only problem in this movie, maybe not a problem, more missundertanding, is the character of Babak Yazdi and his mother. I'm a persian myself and they were soppose to be persians though. Persians are not black like most of indians or arabs. Persian race is a pure white race and most of them are white and color of their heir vary from dark brown to blonde. their dark skin is most cause of the sun, not their race and even dark skin persians are beautiful people, like spanish or italian people. so I think when they want to show a persian boy, they must show a real persian not an indian or Arab like and not even a persian from some minority races. persia is not like america and people there, are not too familiar with other races. and the name of his mother, Jamileh, it's not a common name in persia. I've not heard one myself since my mother's aunt died 20 years ago. so this is the fact that filmmakers who want to use persians in their movies better remember!</p></body></html>

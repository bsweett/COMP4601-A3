In particular were some scenes on an Indian train that reminded me of some scenes in Gandhi.  Seeing the evil people using kids to beg on the street really hit home with me, it's everywhere in China.  And it's sick.  There were also some good, funny moments during the interrogation scenes when Jamal stood up to his tormenters.<br /><br />But I don't think the romance worked at all.  The relationship with his brother didn't feel real at all either, it felt very tacked on.  And I found it hard to care about the main character, especially because he spends half his screen time mute, staring into space.<br /><br />Will he win the money and the girl or lose both.  I didn't care at all one way or the other.  I didn't find much fun in the film, and there's absolutely nothing there to think about.<br /><br />It really is the worst Oscars ever.</p></body></html>

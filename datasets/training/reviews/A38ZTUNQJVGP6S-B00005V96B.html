<meta name="summary" content="The truth about monsters"></head><body><p>Monsters, Inc. is one hour and thirty-four minutes and was released in theaters on November 2, 2001. The movie focuses around two main characters: James P. "Sulley" Sullivan and Michael "Mike" Wazowski. Sulley and Mike are best friends who live together and work at the Monsters, Inc; a scare plant. Sulley is the top Scarer at the plant and Mike is his assistant scarer. At the end of a shift one day Mike forgot to file his paperwork because his mind is on Celia Mae, his girlfriend, who he is taken her to Harryhausen for her birthday. Sulley steps in for Mike and does his paperwork for him. Sulley is picking up the paperwork and notices that one of the doors has not been put away. He peeks in the room to see if there are any monsters in it and finds out there is none. When he is back on the Scare Floor he sees a little two year old girl playing with his tail and all fun breaks loose. The rest of the story is about Sulley and Mike trying to get Boo (the name giving to the three year old girl by Sulley) back to her world. Along the way the two find out the Randall is kidnapping children for his scare machine and the one who is to blame for the door being found by Sulley. Mike and Sulley are at one point banished to the Himalayas where they meet the Abominable Snowman who was also banished there for reasons unknown. Back at Monsters, Inc. the two send Randall through one of the doors and destroy the door so he cannot return, get Mr. Waternoose to reveal the plans of the scare machine to the Child Detection Agency, and finally send Boo home. The computer animation of Monsters, Inc. is great, the story does not drag, and it keeps everybody laughing. The only thing I really hate is the two disc set. In my opinion everything could have gone on one disc and much of what is on Disc 2 could have been left off. Monsters, Inc. gets an AAAA++++.<br /><br />DVD FEATURES<br /><br />Disc 1<br />Scene Selection<br />Bonus Features<br />1.

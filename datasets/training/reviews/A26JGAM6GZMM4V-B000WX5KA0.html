What to say about it? Bickle is a delusional and dysfunctional (probably deranged) taxi driver in Manhattan who is strongly attracted to Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a beautiful young woman centrally involved in the political campaign of Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris); Bickle also attempts to befriend Iris (Jodie Foster), a runaway teenage prostitute. He proclaims "I'm God's lonely man!" In some respects resembling the psychotic character Archer Maggott played by Telly Savalas in The Dirty Dozen, Bickle also sees himself as God's avenging angel whose mission in life is to eliminate all of the evil which he perceives in his world. After recently seeing this film again, I asked myself the same question I did in 1976: How many Travis Bickles are out there? All of the performances are outstanding. Working carefully with Paul Schrader's screenplay on which he presumably collaborated, Scorcese portrays a sordid, potentially violent underworld which is most dangerous after all the "good people" are comfortably settled and secure in their homes. Laurent Bouzereau's 70-minute "making of" feature provided with the Collector's Edition is highly informative, as are the mini-biographies of Scorcese, De Niro, Keitel, Foster, and Shepherd.</p></body></html>

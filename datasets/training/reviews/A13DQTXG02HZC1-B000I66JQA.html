I didn't find the courage to watch it until recently because many of my friends either despised it or that they left the cinema early not knowing how to watch it.  I know this sounds silly, watching a movie is simply sit and watch but everyone's thought process is different and work on different levels.  I'm sure that people would appreciate the beauty of this movie would not tolerate the crassness of JackAss the movie, that's for sure!  I find the Hours akin to a musical composition; it is moving with the rhythmical precision of a well-composed piece where everything fit together nicely to give us a coherent cacophony of sound.  I find it absorbing to sit through additional features such as Michael Cunningham (the author)'s talk on this Pulitzer winning book, of how he came out with the idea of writing about the lives of three women: the author, the character, and the reader.  The talks continued about the David Hare's involvement in the script, Director's decision of the choice of his casting, the difficulty that he faced in the making of this film, documentaries about Virginia Woolf, Mrs Dalloway, the character that Virginia created.  Even the title of "The Hours" meant something.  Some of the things said in the movie lingered on even when the curtain drew to a close.  It's very profound when Virginia explained to her husband that sometimes, someone needed to die so that the living can appreciate and cherish their lives.  How true!  All three ladies in The Hours are deemed to be visionary, ahead of their times, not conventional in any sense of the word and because of that, their actions, things that they do are construed as out of ordinary.  As time moves on, history would judge them rather differently.  This movie is worth watching again in order to explore the many layers and depths that it contains.  For me, it's quite a journey.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

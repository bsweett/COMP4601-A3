<meta name="summary" content="Madagascar is funny in doses.....The Penguins rule!!!!"></head><body><p>Ben Stiller (Zoolander, Envy), Chris Rock (Dogma, Longest Yard),<br /><br />David Schwimmer (Duane Hopwood, Friends), Jada Pinkett Smith (Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions), Sascha Baren Cohen (The Ali G Show), Andy Richter (Big Trouble, Dr. T and The Women) and Cedric The Entertainer (Be Cool, Man of the House) lend their voices to this funny comedy which kids will eat it up like hot cakes, which also has adult themes in it as well. A Zebra (Rock) wants to go out into the wild when he finds out the psychotic Penguins are gonna try to escape from the zoo to go to Antartica, so he busts loose and his animal friends, A Lion (Stiller), A Hippo (Smith) and A Giraffe (Schwimmer) go after him but they get caught, along with the Penguins and Monkeys and are shipped off back to their mainland. But then, the Penguins take over the ship making The Lion, The Zebra, The Hippo and The Giraffe go over board and wind up on the sandy beach of Madagascar where they meet Lemur friends. Some pretty funny dialouge from the actors....the greatest thing is watching the Penguins...and their even funny in the small little movie A Christmas Caper. Not the best animated movie but it sure was funny watching The Penguins.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Too Over The Top & Recycled Jokes, But It's Funny!"></head><body><p>MOVIE: In this sequel to Meet The Parents we get to see Ben Stiller for the sixth time this year in a movie.  I didn't enjoy this one as much as I did the first one.  Some of the scenes are just way too over the top and it doesn't fit at all.  The movie is enjoyable though, I found it to be worth my while, it's just that I wouldn't have carried it as far as they did.  There is one scene where the family is eating dinner and talking about the wedding, Barbra Streisand then brings out a memory book of Stiller's childhood.  When the other mother picks up this crusty thing and asks "oh my, you kept the umbilical cord?" in which Streisand replies "oh no, that's Gaylord's forskin from his circumcison."  Then she throws it up and it lands in the Fondue pot.  While the movie is funny, it can step overboard at times to a point where you want it to step back but it doesn't.<br /><br />ACTING: The cast from the first movie are all the same, but our new additions are Streisand and Dustin Hoffman as the Fockers.  The two are funny and pull this cuckoo but heartwarming feel.  I think the cast works well, but I'm sorry, I have just had enough of Ben Stiller for one year.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: An outrageous romp that will leave you laughing hard at times, but it's just too much.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Solid, Semi-Sci-Fi Action Movie. Interesting Premise & Talented Cast."></head><body><p>"The Island" was supposed to be a big Summer 2005 action movie, but it flopped at U.S. box offices. That's too bad, because this is a better film than director Michael Bay's 1998 action blockbuster "Armageddon", and it's a lot easier on the ear drums too. "The Island" did well in overseas box office. It's failure in the U.S. is blamed on poor marketing. The ads emphasized the film's nebulous themes instead of trying to sell it as an action movie. Mistake. The film's premise is interesting, although not actually plausible, but this is an action-packed game of chase. Themes aside, "The Island" is about an innocent young couple being pursued by evil-doers with big guns. A moderately interesting story and a talented cast make it that much better.<br /><br />In the year 2019, brilliant geneticist Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean) provides needy people with organs and tissues cloned from their own DNA. Those who can afford to pay can replace organs lost to illness or injury with perfect clones. Unbeknownst to the clients, Dr. Merrick has been unable to produce suitable organs in vegetative clones. He clones the entire person and then destroys the clone when the organs are harvested. Merrick's Institute keeps an entire population of clones in an underground city under the pretense that they are survivors of a massive contamination of the planet, so they can't go outside. The Island is a single remaining "pathogen-free zone", and people get the opportunity to move there by lottery. Unfortunately for Merrick, some of the clones have developed greater intellect than he supposed. Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) has begun to question his surroundings and developed a friendship with a young woman named Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johanssen).<br /><br />Since "The Island" is set in 2019, it has more advanced technology that we do -some of the ideas came from Microsoft's think tank- but it's close enough to us to have immediacy. The audience just has to take the clones' plight at face value. It defies logic but is provocative enough to add interest. The Institute's underground city is visually captivating, and director Michael Bay put together an impressive cast: Ewan McGregor plays duel, and opposite, roles. Scarlett Johanssen makes her dumb-but-determined character sympathetic. Quirky Steve Buschemi has a pivotal supporting role. And Sean Bean gives Dr. Merrick, who is confident in the righteousness of his agenda, sufficient stature. The action sequences run a familiar gamut, including helicopters with skyscrapers and an extended car chase, but they have some creative twists. "The Island" is really a solid action film that will appeal to anyone looking for adrenaline-pumping entertainment.<br /><br />The DVD (Dreamworks 2005): There is one featurette and an audio commentary by director Michael Bay. "The Future In Action" (15 minutes) is a documentary about shooting the film's action sequences, in particular the car chase and the giant "R" falling from the building. It includes interviews with director Michael Bay, the stunt coordinator, visual effects supervisor, and special effects supervisor, among others. In the audio commentary, Michael Bay provides scene-by-scene commentary for most scenes, focusing mostly on technical aspects of the film, such as production design, sets, the film's technologies, and challenges. There is also some commentary on cast, characters, and the film's box office problems. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, and French.</p></body></html>

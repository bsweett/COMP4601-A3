But storm clouds gather inexorably on the horizon; the Kingdom of Argos, infuriated by the cruel indifferences and vicissitudes of the Gods, has declared war on the omnipotent rulers of Mount Olympus themselves. Almighty Zeus (Liam Neeson), angered by the impudence of his creations, unleashes his banished brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) upon the face of the Earth in order to teach them a lesson. Perseus' family are amongst the first casualties of Hades' slaughter and, driven by inconsolable rage, he resolves to destroy the very ruler of the underworld himself...<br /><br />"Clash Of The Titans" is a splendid remake of a very silly but fun film. Because, let's be honest, as enjoyable as the original was, it was never a classic - not even at the time of it's release (which I remember very clearly). The original was a giant cheese football of a movie and this film is also a giant cheese football of a movie; the thing that they both have in common is that they're both completely enjoyable, largely because neither one takes itself very seriously at all.<br /><br />Like most of the best remakes, "Clash Of The Titans" reworks the concept of it's progenitor in order to go somewhere a little bit different. This film is a little darker than the original and, in a suitably Ouroborosian twist, has clearly been influenced by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NN7AKU">God of War: Collection</a> (an excellent PS2 game which was itself very clearly influenced by the original "Clash Of The Titans" - to the point that Harry Hamlin, the actor who played the original Perseus, voiced a character in "God Of War 2"). But while this film may favour a slightly darker tone, director Louis Leterrier  (who also made the fiendishly enjoyable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DHXT20">The Incredible Hulk (Widescreen Edition)</a> with Ed Norton) knows what made the original work and, CGI effects aside, keeps this film very much in the style of camp eighties fantasy movies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000056WR3">Krull</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005Q4D7">The Beastmaster</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783241895">Conan the Barbarian - Collector's Edition</a> whilst throwing in some very subversive humour and the odd nod to the original (the brief cameo from Bubo, the rather naff clockwork Owl from the original, had me in fits of laughter, largely due to the way it was played).<br /><br />Personally, I think "Clash Of The Titans" stands head and shoulders over most of the bilge that has filled our cinemas lately. Sam Worthington makes a doggedly rugged Perseus; the rest of the cast (including Mads Mikkelsen, Liam Cunningham, Vincent Regan, Polly Walker and the gorgeous Gemma Arterton) all do a cracking job and clearly have fun doing it; Liam Neeson wanders around in a silly beard and armour; Ralph Fiennes throws in a combination impersonation of Terence Stamp in "Superman 2", Nicol Williamson in "Excalibur" and Richard Harris in "Gladiator" and the film as a whole is generally just a good, all-round, old-fashioned fantasy romp which doesn't take itself at all seriously and is over in under two hours.<br /><br />Frankly I really have no idea why this remake engendered so much hatred at the time of it's release and I genuinely don't know what's going on with audiences these days. They shower praise on simplistic, portentous drek such as "Avatar" like it's a rediscovered Tolstoy novel, yet they can't enjoy a good, old-fashioned fantasy flick which plays fast and loose with Greek mythology (in a deeply amusing manner) and which is merely the latest in a long line of films in which men in sandals and silly beards kick seven shades of what-the-horse-drops out of animated monsters.<br /><br />Myself personally, I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish and would love to see a sequel.<br /><br />Engage with it on the level on which it's intended and I suspect you'll have fun with it too.</p></body></html>

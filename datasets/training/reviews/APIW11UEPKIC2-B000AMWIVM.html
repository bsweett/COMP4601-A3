<meta name="summary" content="pretty good, but the gore comes in way after it should have."></head><body><p>When you see it you will know what I am  talking about, the goriest part was just absolutely pointless.<br /><br />So other than than it was a mildly entertaining movie.<br /><br />One of the main problems I had with this movie is not setting up danny glover's character, this was just stupid in my opinion.<br /><br />Also the guy running the game was also kind of stupid when you learn all that is going on.  i think the movie would be better if they left some things untold and better involvement for the smaller characters would have helped.<br /><br />Overall gore when they didn't need it, a lot of wholes, and the fact that I never got that tension feeling I was looking for from the 2 main character.<br /><br />Other than that, it was pretty entertaining, rent it don't buy it.</p></body></html>

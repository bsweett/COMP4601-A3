Released theatrically in the U.S. in 2004, the film's story centers around three assassins, a warrior and a king who are experts with martial arts in pre-unified China.  Each of the assassins are from the kingdom of Zhao and want to kill the king (Daoming Chen) of the neighboring kingdom known as Qin. As the film begins, the king of Qin has requested a visit from a nameless warrior (Jet Li) who claims to have defeated the assassins.  The nameless warrior enters a great empty hall and is told to sit about 50 paces from the king to tell his story.  The king sits on a raised platform. In front of the platform and separating him from the rest of the great hall are a hundred or more flickering oil-filled lamps shaped like small soldiers.  As the nameless soldier begins to tell his story about how he defeated the assassins, the film flashes back to a Zhao village with a massive Qin army approaching.  Inside the Zhao village is a school of calligraphy in which the assassins have come to live: Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Moon (Ziyi Zhang, who played the pivotal character of Jen Yu in the 2000 film "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon").  In this first version of the story with all of the Zhao people wearing red, the Qin army opens fire with a massive number of arrows shot from very long bows.  The arrows begin to destroy the village and the calligraphy school.  The assassins escape the onslaught, but are encountered by the nameless warrior who successfully defeats them.  Returning to the king of Qin's great hall, the king is suspicious of the nameless warrior's story and proceeds to tell what he believes really happened.  In this second version of the nameless warrior's battle with the three assassins, they all wear blue and a beautiful battle scene unfolds over a lake with floating choreography reminiscent of the 2000 film "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon".  Returning again to the king of Qin's great hall, the king becomes suspicious of the warrior's true intensions as the flickering oil lamps blow in a particular direction to warn the king.  It is here the final and more honest telling of the story begins with the three assassins and the nameless warrior all wearing white.  Here, Broken Sword explains why several years earlier he did not kill the king of Qin when he and Flying Snow had the opportunity to do so.  During this explanation the film flashes back several more years to the king of Qin's great hall, which is filled with green drapes.  With Broken Sword and Flying Snow each wearing green and taking on the king's massive army, Broken Sword engages in a personal battle with the king; but makes a surprising choice.  Here, at last, the full meaning of the story becomes clear as time shifts back to the present for a highly emotional ending.<br /><br />With a combination of exquisite uses of color, beautiful cinematography, superb martial arts choreography and a complex story, "Hero" is a wonderful film to watch.  If you enjoyed films such as the 2000 "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" or the 2004 "The House of Flying Daggers" (in which Ziyi Zhang also starred), you will probably enjoy "Hero".  What is important to remember with "Hero" is the historical context for the film: the first emperor of China was the king of the kingdom of Qin, who successfully and brutally conquered the other former Chinese kingdoms to unify China. Other memorable characters in the film include Sky (Donnie Yen), the scholar (Liu Zhong Yuan), the old servant (Zheng Tia Yong), the general (Chang Xiao Yang) and the commander (Zhang Ya Kun).  Overall, I rate the 2002 film "Hero" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

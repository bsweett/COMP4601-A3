<meta name="summary" content="For Lovers of Video Games"></head><body><p>DOOM, believe it or not, is based on a video game!  With all the literature of the world, all the fine screenplays that are stacked on the shelves, all the creative stories that languish in the 'not for profit probably' bins, it seems a raw commentary on today's movie audiences to spend millions of dollars on a game everyone who cares already knows.  But, movies are business and box office demands take precedence.<br /><br />As the narrator of the film states, 'In the year 2026 archaeologists working in the Nevada desert discovered a portal to an ancient city on Mars. They call this portal the Ark. Twenty years later, we're still struggling to understand why it was built and what happened to the civilization that built it' is the apparent 'story'. What follows is a series of conflicts between killers transforming into beasts right out of Hieronymous Bosch and Francis Bacon only to bloody up the claustrophobic computer generated interiors with occasional transmogrifications into mercurial clouds only to reappear.  Much slaughter, much eye dazzling color manipulation, and ever so little story line fill the screen.  The participants in this real time game are The Rock (he needs a role that uses his talent), hunky Karl Urban, Dexter Fletcher, Rosamond Pike, and Richard Brake - all squashed around the set by director and head gladiator Andrej Bartkowiak.<br /><br />Though not meant to be, this film can actually be fun to watch as a hilarious parody of scientific world events.  Visually and content-wise it wears thin after about a half hour.  Grady Harp, November 06</p></body></html>

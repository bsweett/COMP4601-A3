There's nothing wrong with a good movie. "I Am Legend" may miss the mark as a great movie but what it does do it does extremely well. While Francis Lawrence's "I Am Legend" (this is the third version of the story told on film based on Richard Matheson's novel of the same name but it inspired countless other films including "Night of the Living Dead")may be bigger and bolder than "The Last Man on Earth" and "The Omega Man" (the two other film versions of the same tale), it is the small moments as well as the action sequences that make this film worthwhile.<br /><br />Will Smith plays Dr. Robert Neville a military researcher brought in to solve a cure for cancer that has gone horribly wrong. The virus designed to deliver the payload kills patients with those remaining alive turned into creatures that seem to have no ability to reason and become monsters. Neville fails at stopping the outbreak from spreading but he remains in New York City still searching for a cure accompanied by his only companion a dog his son gave him. While hunting for the "Night Seekers" for his experiments, he also must avoid being hunted by them for food.<br /><br />Will Smith gives a terrific, nuanced performance as Neville and is the biggest asset. The visual effects of an abandoned and overgrown Times Square are stunning and captures the sense of isolation that Neville feels. He's not only cut off from the world but he's also cut himself off from many of his own emotions overcome by a sense of failure but still believing "I can fix this". There are some other fine performances in the film as well but saying any more about them would provide too many spoilers.<br /><br />The main flaws of the film are the Night Seekers and plot holes in the last act of the film. The Night Seekers are effectively used but we see too much of them (they would have been more frightening in shadow)and they don't look real enough (at least to me). The plot holes in the third act I won't reveal (again, they also reveal spoilers)but suffice to say the film is very good inspite of its flaws.<br /><br />The DVD has two versions of the film. The first on disc 1 is the theatrical cut (which I felt was inferior). The second disc has a short documentary on the real threat we face by viruses both natural and man made with experts from Harvard and other leading research facilities chiming in on the beauty of a virus (which is neithr living or dead according to one researched but somewhere inbetween). The second disc has the alternate cut of the film and there's also a weblink to bonus material. The Blu-ray INCLUDES the bonus featurettes which amount of about 50 minutes of material.<br /><br />We also get animated comics that show the effects of the disease across the world.<br /><br />Speaking of which, the theatrical cut and alternate versions are seamlessly branched on the single disc Blu-ray and HD-DVD.<br /><br />While a flawed film, "I Am Legend" is a very good thrill ride with a strong central performance by Will Smith which sells even the weaker aspects of the story. The 2 disc DVD edition really should have been a single disc edition (with the bonus material) like the Blu-ray.</p></body></html>

She's played by Jessica Biel and the Prince (Rufus Sewell) wants to marry her and he's used to getting what he wants. Norton and Biel want to be together but they know the Prince will have them killed if they try to runaway together. After someone is murdered, the chief inspector (Paul Giamatti) has his eyes on Norton.<br /><br />  The Illusionist is a beautifully done movie. It's well acted, well filmed and a well told fairytale. Rufus Sewell deserves some credit here as the Prince. Yes he has played similar roles in the past but he manages to make this performance different a little than his usual villian performance. It's a little closer to Joaquin Phoenix's performance in Gladiator than Sewell's villian performance's in A Knight's Tale or The Legend of Zorro. I think he gives one of his best performances ever.<br /><br />  Paul Giamatti also has a better role here than he did Lady in the Water. He was wasted there but here he's fantastic and pretty much owns every scene he's in. Biel also handles a serious role fine as well and gives a better performance than she has in any movie. I'm talking about Norton less because you already know he's good of course. I love everything about this movie, even the musical score is well done.</p></body></html>

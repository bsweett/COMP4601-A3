<meta name="summary" content="Remake Clashes With the Original"></head><body><p>First let me say that I am rarely one to complain about an old movie, even a classic movie, getting a modern day makeover. I see negative reviews of remakes based alone on the feeling that some movies are sacred and should never be messed with. I say if you can take a classic and make it even better, then by all means have at it. This 2010 version of Clash of the Titans fails at making the 1981 version better and maybe was worth looking at only because of its cool CGI effects.<br /><br />I'd have been completely satisfied if fledgling Director Louis Leterrier took the 1981 original story word for word and simply re-did it with updated FX. While he did indeed pay homage to the 1981 version in many respects, it seems he got lost more in creating cool looking FX and abandoning the perfect story flow that the original had. Adding certain aspects to the story could have been interesting if it all made sense, but for me it just didn't make sense and seemed to jump all over the place.<br /><br />And then there was the acting, or should I say lack thereof. It didn't seem to me that Sam Worthington who played Perseus or Liam Neeson who played Zeus took their roles seriously at all. They came across as two A-listers making cameos versus lead actors giving A-list performances. This combined with the uneven storytelling really took a lot out of the movie for me.<br /><br />I was never even a fan of Greek Mythology until seeing the original Clash back in the 80s. After that movie I not only became interested in Greek Mythology, I felt I now actually knew something about it...like I just had a very clear and concise lesson in it. After the 2010 Clash, I felt the same way I did after the recent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NTPDT6">Transformers</a>...like I'd just seen a lot of cool FX with little substance to the story.<br /><br />So my recommendation is to pick up the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q7ZOL2">the 1981 original version</a> and pass on this 2010 version until it comes out on cable. As dated as Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion effects will look in the 1981 version, you'll walk away from it with a much more entertaining and even educating experience. And if you're just looking for some mythological fun I'd say get yourself a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0J4VQ">PlayStation 3</a> and spend countless hours with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NN7AKU">God of War Collection</a>.</p></body></html>

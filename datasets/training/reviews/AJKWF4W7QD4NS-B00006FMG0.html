<meta name="summary" content="A worthy follow up to American Beauty"></head><body><p>With all the critical praise and the handful of Academy Awards that were bestowed on American Beauty, director Sam Mendes had a lot to live up to with his follow up film.  Based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, Road to Perdition tells the story of Irish mob hitman Mike Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who, along with his pre-teen son, are on the run while he seeks revenge on his former partner who murdered his family.  Hanks gives one of his better (but not his best) performances as he tries to against his typical good guy roles (a la an Oscar winning Denzel Washington), but in the end he comes out being a likeable character nonetheless.  Paul Newman (in an Oscar nominated performance) chews up as much screen time as he can, but his best moments are when he and Hanks share the screen together.  The standout performance however, goes to Jude Law as a picture taking hitman sent after Hanks and son, and while his screen time is limited, Law is simply chilling and gives us the film's most memorable role.  Mendes' directing is slow paced, but that doesn't take anything away from the film thanks to the gorgeous cinematography that set this tale of redemption and revenge apart from other films of its' genre.  All in all, I strongly suggest Road to Perdition to anyone and everyone, although some will say that this is not for all tastes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not Just A Simple Sequel"></head><body><p>From the commercials, one could easily believe that Final Destination is simply a retelling of the first story.  In other words, a group of people cheat death and then are hunted down by death to set things right.  But that would be wrong.<p>At first it seems that this is true.  A young woman has a vision of a terrible highway accident and refuses to get on the highway.  The people stuck on the ramp behind her do not get caught in the accident.<p>Unlike the first movie, Death does not wait.  No one-month hiatus here.  Saved victims immediately begin to drop.  But again, this is not just more of the same.  These people share a secret that they don't know about.  A secret you will have to see the movie to find out.<p>Another difference is that there is more hope in this movie.  Two characters return from the first movie; the only survivor and the mortuary worker.  But there are more scenes of death not happening, of death happening in more unexpected ways and a little less of the Rube Goldberg style accidents (although I liked the pool ball and mousetrap).<p>Although the gore is a little more obvious (typical in a sequel) the plot is somewhat better due to the additional dimensions.  The main character is also a relief.  In the first movie, the hero sulked too much and never tried to explain things to the police.  This time we have a hero who really works at surviving and saving others.<p>A very good film for horror fans.</p></body></html>

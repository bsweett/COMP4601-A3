<meta name="summary" content="Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"></head><body><p>Captain Jack (Depp) is back, and causing trouble for Will Turner (Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Knightley).  Their marriage is interrupted when they are arrested for aiding in the escape of Captain Jack.  Lord Cutler Beckett (Hollander) does not want to see them die, and wants to make a deal.  If they help him get Jack, they will not be put to death.  Will finds Jack being worshiped as a god by a bunch of cannibals.  After a fashion, they escape to the Black Pearl, where Jacking is looking for a mysterious chest that belongs to Davey Jones (Nighy).  Jones is trying to get to the chest before Jack for reasons of his own.  Amongst all this, Elizabeth shows up to join the hunt, and finds a new interest in Captain Jack.<br /><br />"Dead Man's Chest" delivers all that "Curse of the Black Pearl" delivered, but the difference is that "Black Pearl" was new and fresh, while "Chest" gives off a feeling of "been there, done that."  That is not to say that "Dead Man's Chest" does not deliver the goods, but it is not as original, and that is a slight drawback.  Another negative is the running length.  At 155 minutes, it is longer than it needs to be.  That being said, it is good to see Captain Jack and the gang back in action again.  The action is well done, and the special effects are top notch, especially the squid-faced Davey Jones.  A few cliffhangers thrown in at the end assures "Pirates 3" a warm reception come May 2007.  If you like the first film, you will like this one.  I recommend it, and hope that "Pirates 3" can take it up a notch to end on a high note.</p></body></html>

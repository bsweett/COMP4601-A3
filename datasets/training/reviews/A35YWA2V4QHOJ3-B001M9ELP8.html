<meta name="summary" content="Running down the Rock"></head><body><p>I found this to be a surprisingly entertaining movie.  Filmed in Hawaii (a stand-in locale that doubles for Brazil), the cinematography is terrific.  The ROCK plays a sort of bounty-hunter who is out to bring a kid (Seann William Scott - AKA "Stiffler") back to his father.  Along the way, they have run ins with the local who runs the town (Christopher Walken).<br /><br />The ROCK's movies tend to be entertaining, although I can't see him being the next Arnie.  The action / adventure / comedy is his most natural genre.  He doesn't quite have the charisma of the slow-talking, talk-with-an-accent Arnie.  However, The ROCK can still carve out a niche for himself and make many more movies to come.<br /><br />As always Seann William Scott is hilarious, although some of the comic elements in this film don't really "work."  Christopher Walken was a good choice to be the stoic villain who is bent on enslaving a town of natives.<br /><br />If you enjoy adventure movies, give this one a spin.  It's more comical than most adventure movies.  And, most importantly, it's a whole lotta fun to watch!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Batman, Revived..."></head><body><p>1989's "Batman" was rightly a cinematic hit.  Directed by Tim Burton, it features a dark and brooding storyline, amazing sets, a well-chosen cast, and an update on the technology traditionally associated with the Batman character.<br /><br />Michael Keaton was a surprising choice as the Dark Knight, by day a weathly philanthropist, by night the Caped Crusader.  Keaton's touch is to portray on-screen, and successfully, the motivation of a scarred childhood that drives Bruce Wayne to create and live through his alter-ego, Batman.  This Batman fights crime in a black rubber and kevlar-armored suit, using a variety of gadgets to come and go from crime scenes.<br /><br />Batman's opponent in this film is the Joker, played with over-the-top maniacal evil by Jack Nicholson in an Academy-Award-nominated performance.  The Joker is a gangland hood who survives betrayal and an industrial accident on a job, emerging as the deformed and now insane master of crime in Gotham City.<br /><br />Beautiful photojournalist Vickie Vale, earnestly played by Kim Basinger, becomes the object of desire of both men.  Their parallel story arcs will intersect in her person, who is kidnapped by the Joker and must be rescued by Batman, in a spectacular finale set in the bell tower Gotham Cathedral.<br /><br />Burton's superb direction takes full advantage of the brooding, spectacular and vaguely retro sets; if this movie has any fault, it is that scene, mood, and setting tend to overwhelm the characters.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as excellent entertainment for fans of the Batman franchise.  Its success sparked three lesser sequels, with Valmer Kilmer and George Clooney taking their turns as Batman while being crowded off the stage by their respective villians.</p></body></html>

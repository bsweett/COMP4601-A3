<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing sequel"></head><body><p>"Be Cool" is a disappointing sequel to 1995's "Get Shorty", a clever, funny satire of mobsters, mayhem and the movie business. Both movies are based on novels by acclaimed crime author Elmore Leonard.<br /><br />In "Get Shorty" gangster Chili Palmer comes to Hollywood to collect a debt and ends up falling in love with the movies. In "Be Cool" he has become a big Hollywood producer who is now bored with it all. After a friend in the music business is murdered, he becomes involved in a war between various factions of hip hop music. Along the way be becomes involved with a beautiful woman and guides to career of a talented young singer.<br /><br />The movie's big problem is that the satire is not fresh. The jokes about movie sequels, stars and hip hop music aren't that funny. Even the in jokes about Travolta and costar Uma Thurman's movie classics don't work.<br /><br />Rather than buying or renting "Be Cool" [which isn't], I suggest you reach for "Get Shorty" [which is].</p></body></html>

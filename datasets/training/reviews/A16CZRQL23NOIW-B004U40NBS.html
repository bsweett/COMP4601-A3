<meta name="summary" content="The broken image of a distorted soul!"></head><body><p>The black swan is probably the most original script of the year. Art and reality shake hands in this complex psychological study of a shy and dominated girl (a suffocating mother and a very exigent dance teacher) whose repressed sexual life and the excessive tension caused by intern rivalries of the cast who ardently are trying to beat her to get this first -rate role will origin a very hazardous cocktail of immeasurable dimensions that sooner or later,  will lead her to experience a set of  tense situations, unbearable stress which will conform a web of majuscule proportions and an unexpected finale.<br /><br />The "somber" was a term designed by Jung to label all of those repressions and dark labyrinths of the human soul and encloses all sort of hidden dragons who nestle into our unconscious.<br /><br />Natalie Portman is outstanding in the role of her lifetime. Don't miss it.</p></body></html>

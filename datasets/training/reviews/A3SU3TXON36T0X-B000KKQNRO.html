Unfortunately, the movie is rather dull and gets bogged down in the details.  Only the part of Sophie Neveu played by Audrey Tautou offers anything of redeeming value.  As has been pointed out by countless others, the movie is of course motivated by an anti-Christian conspiracy, allegations first spawned in the book _Holy Blood, Holy Grail_ that Mary Magdelene was the wife of Jesus Christ and that together they spawned a bloodline.  This Masonic conspiracy is further boistered up by hidden documents which supposedly revealed the presence of a secret society, the Priory of Sion, which existed to protect the bloodline.  The movie as the book gives way to all sorts of feminist goddess-worshipping nonsense and anti-Christian, anti-Catholic bigotry.  Opus Dei is portrayed as a sinister organization intent on suppressing the "truth" of the holy bloodline, but also easily led astray by Leigh Teabing (a name which is a convenient anagram of the writer of _HB/HG_, Baigent and his partner Leigh), the supposed Grail researcher.  Conveniently Brown never mentions in his book the good done by this organization, how it has led many to God and how it runs shelters for troubled youth, nor the good done by the Catholic church, giving way to every manner of anti-Catholic bigotry so popular in our culture today.  No!  This would all interfere with a good conspiracy story and we could not have that.  Ultimately however the movie fails on several levels.  It is overly long and gets boring in the middle.  Robert Langdon's character played by Tom Hanks comes across as easily confused and prone to claustrophobic fits.  The historical commentary (which there is much of) is almost all uniformly wrong or biased.  And the movie ends up being too much talk and not enough action.  For those of us who did read the book before (and it is nearly impossible not to have given its great proliferation), the movie is ultimately boring because we already know the story all-too-well and the few details which do not coincide with the book itself are rather trivial.  In sum, I believe I am justified in calling this a work of high kitsch which no doubt will enjoy great popularity among the many lost souls craving for something to believe in in this darkened world.</p></body></html>

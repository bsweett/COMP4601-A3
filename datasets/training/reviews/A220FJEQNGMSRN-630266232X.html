<meta name="summary" content="A fine thriller but not a great one"></head><body><p>The picture nobody wanted, Laura was one of Fox's most notorious bad-luck pictures, and some of the bad luck stuck. After all the studio's A-list directors had turned it down (one of whom, John Brahm, ironically went on to remake it as Portrait For Murder in TV's 20th Century Fox Hour), Rouben Mamoulian began the picture until producer Preminger took over, reshooting much of his footage. Even David Raksin's famous theme only came about when Alfred Newman, Bernard Herrmann et al had turned down the picture. The result may well be an acknowledged classic, but while it's good, it's not THAT good.<br /><br />Something is missing. That we are unaware of working-class detective Andrews' infatuation with the dead murder victim Laura until until the venal Waldo Lydecker tells him, despite Andrews fine performance, is indicative of the problems of the film. That we have to be told so much instead of sensing it for ourselves is one of the film's greatest weaknesses. Some of this can be attributed to Darryl F. Zanuck's penchant for over-editing - it takes a while for it to become clear that the victim's face has been shot off - some to rewrites, but regardless of their cause, all play against the film. Structurally, too, it is scarred. The decision to reduce the original three narrators to one either goes too far or not far enough: as it stands, Waldo's opening narration is soon ignored and later lacks logic.<br /><br />Despite her awe-inspiringly bad taste in hats (she favors the S'Wester look), Gene Tierney is all about the look, not the performance here. While the painting of Laura (in reality a touched up photograph) holds a magical allure, she cannot live up to the eulogies of the supporting cast in the flesh. The real stars of the show are Vincent Price's Southern gigolo and Clifton Webb, great fun in an overwritten part as the patron saint of purple prose Waldo Lydecker that makes the film feel like a Joe Mankiewicz drawing room thriller rather than a noir.<br /><br />Yet for all its weaknesses, Laura is full of good things. There is some brilliant camerawork from Joseph LaShelle, who took over from Mamoulian's choice of Lucien Ballard after filming Webb's screen test (refusing to read for the role, Webb chose to do his Blithe Spirit monologue for the cameras instead!), while David Raksin's theme effectively haunts the detective in its various guises wherever he goes. When the two combine, as in a superb tracking shot that keeps Laura's portrait present in the frame with Andrews as he wanders through her apartment, they become the veritable blood in her veins, creating an impression that no actress could ever live up to. At times the picture even adds up to more than the sum of its parts and it's still a good wallow, but it's one best approached with few expectations if you want to get the most out of it.</p></body></html>

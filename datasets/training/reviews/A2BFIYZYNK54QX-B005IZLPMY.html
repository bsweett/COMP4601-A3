<meta name="summary" content="The best of the Marvel Studios films... thus far!"></head><body><p>For a long time now, Captain America has been my favorite Marvel comics character. He's just awesome. He's been a little on the dark side, particularly during the 80's, when it was required that EVERY superhero comic went through a dark phase, and with some of the recent Brubaker era work, Steve Rogers has seen some serious stuff go down. What Joe Johnston did with this film, and how it not only differentiates itself from all of the other Marvel films (not just the Marvel Studios films, but all films based on Marvel characters), but also how well it works, is how unapologetically sincere and earnest it is.<br /><br />Without exception, all of the other Marvel-based films have had their fill of post-modern cynicism and self-referential humor, and I'm not really knocking it. For the most part, it's suited the films well, particularly X2 and SPIDER-MAN 2. But this is a film set in the 1940's, and it's about a young man who believes so much in the ideals of his country and who so badly wants to make a difference, he's willing to put his own life on the line to potentially change it.<br /><br />Most of the heroes in the comic book world are accidents, or some tragedy drives them, or they were born different and were ostracized for their oddities, but Steve Rogers is a hero long before he ever became Captain America, and the exceptional performance of Chris Evans sells that. If there had been a moment of this film that broke from the era to include a line of dialogue that was post-modern humor, it would have utterly broken the back of this film, but thankfully screenwriters Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus (with a little help from Joss "God" Whedon in a few scenes) never retreat to modern dialogue tropes in order to keep the audience interested. They never make the film totally wooden or sullen either. There is great fun to be had with this film, and you gotta love the little RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK references in it. Also the cast in and of itself is quite good, particularly Stanley Tucci as Abraham Erskine. I honestly get choked up in the scene Erskine and Rogers share in the barracks the night before the experiment. It's my favorite scene of the film, because it gives you time to connect with the characters on an emotional level without any flash or gimmicks. This is pretty easily my favorite of the Marvel Studios films thus far...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A highly enjoyable espionage film"></head><body><p>What a pleasant surprise this was!  I had originally hoped to see this when it came out in the theaters, but the multiple bad reviews I read and the two friends I had who disliked it made me take a pass on it.  Now, I am mystified why people disliked it.  I thought it was a first rate spy thriller.  I had only one serious complaint (a scene in which our hero jumps off an extremely high point holding a corpse underneath him to break the fall:  sorry, a corpse isn't a parachute and wouldn't have kept his body from being crushed by impact).  By and large, it was a thoroughly satisfying spy flick.  <p>I never read the Robert Ludlum novel or saw the first version of the film, but I love the premise:  a man is found floating in the Atlantic with two bullets in his back and a tiny canister in his right hip, a canister that contains information about a Swiss bank account.  Gradually, the man, played by Matt Damon, learns that he possesses a perplexing range of skills with languages, fighting, using a gun, being preternaturally aware of his surroundings, and driving a car.  With the help of a young German woman, fetchingly played by RUN LOLA RUN's Franka Potente, he heads off to Paris from Switzerland, where, as they say, the plot thickens.  I like the way that Matt Damon manages to exude a profound sense of self-confusion while learning that his fighting and survival skills were off-the-chart.  He will accidently get into a fight, leaving two or three people severely injured, and he would be profoundly completely rattled by what he had been able to do.  <p>I don't want to exaggerate the merits of the film.  It isn't a masterpiece; it is a highly enjoyable spy flick.  Everything is executed well, and of the supporting cast Chris Cooper stands out as Bourne's "control" in Washington, DC.  I think anyone who enjoys espionage or action films will find this movie well repays the time spent viewing it.</p></body></html>

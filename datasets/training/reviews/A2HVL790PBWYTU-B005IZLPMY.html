<meta name="summary" content="the star-spangled man with a plan"></head><body><p>It's crucial that you get to like Steve Rogers when he was only this 98-pound weakling, crucial that you grow to care for this runty, scrawny, asthmatic kid who persists in standing up for himself and for others, never mind that this usually rewards him with bruises and lumps. It's 1943, in wartime America, and Steve Rogers yearns to do his part, if the military would only allow him to. Five times he's tried to enlist only to be summarily rejected as 4F. Meanwhile, his best friend James "Bucky" Barnes is a sergeant in the U.S. Army, cutting a dashing figure, shining the ladies, bullying those who'd been bullying Steve. You note Steve's lack of resentment over this, and like him for it.<br /><br />CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER is the one I'd been looking forward to the most this year, and I'm pleased as punch to say that this movie did not tank, that it in fact is fairly bloody brilliant. I enjoyed THOR and X-MEN: FIRST CLASS, but CAPTAIN AMERICA is the best Marvel flick since IRON MAN and it gets you charged up for THE AVENGERS movie. Chris Evans - damn.<br /><br />Steve Rogers's impassioned speech to Bucky is overheard by Dr. Abraham Erskine, a kindly German scientist working for the U.S. government. Dr. Erskine heads a top secret government program involving the creation of the super-soldier, and on these shores he's looking for a candidate to be his inaugural test subject (he'd had an earlier candidate elsewhere but that didn't work out so well; more on that in a bit). Dr. Erskine sees past Steve's sickly frame. He's intrigued with Steve's spirit. He gets him enlisted in the U.S. Army.<br /><br />Compared to the rest of the film, the first third segment is less action-packed, but that doesn't equate to dull or slow. We track Steve Rogers' time in boot camp and we take in his struggles. He tires easy. He's always finishing last. The camp's gruff director, Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones, hogging all the good lines), is highly skeptical and takes Dr. Erskine to task for Rogers' presence. But we note Rogers' quiet diligence and doggedness, and these strong character moments provide the building blocks for making what happens to him later so resonating and gratifying.<br /><br />If you're caught up on Marvel Comics continuity, then you're up to snuff on what happens next. Steve Rogers undergoes Erskine's treatment which galvanizes change on an awesome cellular scale. I think the best CG work done by the film's f/x crew, hands down, is in the shrinking and scrawnying of Chris Evans and making it look seamless. Steve Rogers as the beneficiary of the super-soldier serum is a picture in bold contrast, a foot taller and now rippling with muscles. But this is Chris Evans in real, the guy having worked his tail off to get this buff (even though Chris Hemsworth probably still points at him and smirks).<br /><br />If you don't know your Captain America history, I'll just mention that an act of sabotage renders Steve Rogers the world's one and only super soldier. Which gets us to an inspired plot thread which isn't part of Captain America lore. And, fine, here's a ***SPOILERS alert*** for the rest of this paragraph. With Rogers the only one of his kind, Colonel Phillips has no use for him, and so Steve Rogers is deployed to USO tour appearances, putting on a show in the home front with chorus girls and shilling war bonds as the military mascot "Captain America." Like a good soldier, Steve goes along with it, but he wishes he could do more. We know that Cap will join the war soon enough, but, in the meantime, his time on stage just fills me with cinematic joy. I absolutely love that he gets his own awesome show jingle, "Star Spangled Man," with music by Alan Menken. I also like how the film addresses the inherent cheesiness of the traditional Captain America costume, which is what he wears on these shows. Cap's later costume re-design would be more practical, less shiny, less tights.<br /><br />Chris Evans inhabits his role with conviction, imbues Steve Rogers with spunk and an appealing sweetness, and I'm not worried any more about how he might hold up against Robert Downey, Jr. and Samuel Jackson in THE AVENGERS movie. He just proved to me that he can command the screen. Fine actors like Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci, and Hugo Weaving add so much to the story. If you could point at the heart of the story, it may be the almost father-son relationship between Steve Rogers and Tucci's Dr. Erskine. Tucci isn't in the film much, but he leaves a defining mark. I was concerned about how the Red Skull would come off, but I should've known Hugo Weaving would make it work. His Nazi commandant, Johann Schmidt a.k.a. the Red Skull, is a convincing villain and, incidentally, a failed past test subject of Erskine's. As a guilty pleasure, I'm glad the biochemist Arnim Zola is here as well. Or, I dunno, maybe I'm fond of him because Ookla the Mok's "Super Skrull" song references him. ("He's endorsing RC Cola and cruising chicks with Arnim Zola.")<br /><br />Parts of Steve's origin are snatched from Marvel's Ultimate universe (portraying Bucky as someone in Steve's age bracket, for one thing). For fans of Marvel's cinematic continuity, Dominic Cooper riffs Robert Downey, Jr. a bit as Tony Stark's rakish genius industrialist father, Howard Stark. I wish Hayley Atwell as British Agent Peggy Carter were given more to do, but I suspect Atwell will reappear in future films as Agent 13, Sharon Carter. And if you were expecting Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos to show up, you're sort of right. The action is terrific, and maybe it's terrific because the story had taken the time to invest in its lead character. These aren't just tatters of action sequences. There's a compelling thru arc to tie everything together.<br /><br />But, okay, one thing nagged me. There's something jarringly anachronistic about the presence of Hydra and its super science. The strongest emotional impression I have to Cap is that he was a World War II hero who fought the Nazis and later became a tormented man-out-of-time. This movie removes the first part by replacing the Nazis with Hydra goons. And, although Hydra is supposed to be affiliated with them storm troopers - serving as Hitler's "deep science division" - it's not the same. "Heil Hydra!" just doesn't ring true. And Nazis always did make the best big bads.<br /><br />CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER gives it up with that old-fashioned wartime nostalgia, with a grip of strong performances, with an indomitable legend to whom Chris Evans does justice. This movie has heart. Nothing embodies that more than the sequence in which the new Steve Rogers is in pursuit of a spy who tries to distract him by tossing a boy into the drink. About to dive in the water, Steve hears the boy briskly yell at him: "I can swim. Go get him!" That bit of bravado from the kid generated the loudest cheers from the theater audience.<br /><br />As per norm, stick around until after the closing credits. If what you see doesn't excite you... then you're probably executives over at DC Comics.</p></body></html>

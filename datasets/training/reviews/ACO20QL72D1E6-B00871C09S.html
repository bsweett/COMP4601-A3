<meta name="summary" content="the suspense is killing:-)))"></head><body><p>Hitchcock remembered that Joseph Cotten`s wife almost panicked toward the end of the film when they watched it at the premiere.<br /><br />The film owes a lot to script, Edith Head, scenic design, James Stewart, Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey and Raymond Burr. Grace Kelly is visually right, but her speaking voice is phony and a letdown. Indeed her siblings teased her when she came home to Philadelphia on visit. She sounds like Norwegian actress Greta Gynt in the thriller TAKE MY LIFE.<br /><br />But the suspense is great and it IS HITCHCOCK at his very best.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Powerful, dark fantasy film in the vein of Del Toro's "The Devil's Backbone" and "Cronos""></head><body><p>Set after Spain's Civil War, 12 year old Ofelia escapes into her fantasy world inspired by the books she's read. Her mother has remarried after the death of Ofelia's father to a brutish, sadistic Captain fighting rebels. Ofelia meets Pan a creature that convinces her that she is the reincarnation of a princess of the underworld who died ages ago. Her father has been waiting for her to be reborn but to prove that she is indeed a princess she must accomplish three tasks before the next full moon so she can be reunited with her father and mother.<br /><br />Del Toro's film isn't perfect nor is it as good as some of his other efforts but it is a worthwhile film from this very talented director. It won't appeal to everyone (and it isn't meant to). The performances from all the actors are quite good particularly the little girl playing Ofelia who gives a natural performance without overplaying her role. The production design is, as with all Del Toro's films, exceptional (in fact there are other visual motifs that refer to "Hellboy" one of Del Toro's most successful mainstream projects).<br /><br />Like Del Toro's other films "The Devil's Backbone" and "Cronos", "El Laberinto del Fauno" is a powerful occasionally gruesome sad fantasy film. This isn't fantasy as in "The Wizard of Oz" but darker much closer in tone to the original colorful (and equally gruesome)Grimm Brothers fairytales. Del Toro's film shares a sensibility with some of Terry Gilliam's darker films. If you didn't enjoy "The Devil's Backbone" or any of Del Toro's other films, then you won't enjoy this often visually stunning sad tale.<br /><br />Pan's Labyrinth (as it is known by its English title)is shown with subtitles in Spanish. It won't be for everyone there are a number of brutal, gruesome scenes but these are balanced out by Del Toro's arresting visual imagery.</p></body></html>

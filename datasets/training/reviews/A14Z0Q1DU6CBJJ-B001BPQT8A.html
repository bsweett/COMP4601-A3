<meta name="summary" content="A FLAWLESS MOVIE"></head><body><p>I would never dream of comparing anyone to Alfred Hitchcock.  But, David Fincher, comes damn close.  They have a lot of similarities, but the biggest one that I see is the desire to be precise and perfect.  <p>Seven is Fincher's second movie!  His first being an underrated Alien 3.  In his second effort, Fincher crafted, what I think, to be the best suspense/thriller in thirty-years.  Unique.  Gut churning.  Awesomely acted.  Every shot compliments the next.  Every shot is perfect.  The sound track was perfectly thought out.  Like Hitchcock... the script was well-fleshed out, everything was perfect BEFORE HAND, and everything was perfect afterward.<p>In a sess-pool of cookie-cutter &quot;yes&quot; men that are succeeding in the movie business, Fincher emerged and did it his way.  Thankfully, he continues to do it his way.  Following &quot;Seven&quot;, he continued to do masterful work with well-written movies like &quot;The Game&quot; and &quot;Fight Club&quot;.  &quot;The Panic Room&quot; is coming out soon and I can't wait.<p>It isn't quantity that counts... it's quality.  Fincher takes his time and makes sure it's done RIGHT.  <p>SEVEN.... I think, was and is one the most underrated movies ever.  It will be a classic and is one the best movies ever made.</p></body></html>

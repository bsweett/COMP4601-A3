<meta name="summary" content="I thought it was a fine sci-fi movie"></head><body><p>Obviously, a lot of people have been harshing on this movie, a remake of the 1950s sci-fi classic, "The Day The Earth Stood Still."  Some of the reviews and comments are well-thought out, although many seem to come mostly out of people who either A) loved the original and consider any adaptation to be sacrilege  B) see an opportunity to appear clever by trashing something mainstream and big-budget Hollywood or C) just want to make fun of Keanu Reeves.<br /><br />Now, on the face of things, I would be a perfect candidate for any of these criteria. In general, I loathe Keanu's career and I can be as altie and retro-purist as anyone. However, I enjoyed this film a lot more than I expected to.  I think they did an excellent job updating the material and the film's core message for the 21st Century. In addition to criticizing the human propensity towards violence, they also introduce environmental concerns, and yet they do so with a relatively light touch. The special effects are generaly quite good, and are used in the service of the story, not as an end in and of themselves. Most surprisingly, Reeves is pretty good in the role of Klaatu, the stiff-lipped emissary of an intergalactic federation with its eye on the human race.<br /><br />I liked it. A couple of things kept me from giving this film a full five stars rating, though... Although the first two-thirds hummed along at a nice clip, the ending seemed abrupt and vaguely unsatisfying... In part this lack of emotional connection may come, not from Reeves, but from his costar, child actor Jaden Smith, who is uniquely irritating and uninvolving. He's a really bad, flat actor, and the emotional work that his character is supposed to pull -- convincing a skeptical, superpowered alien that the human race is worth saving -- largely falls into a vacuum. Nonetheless, viewers can still figure out what the filmmakers are trying to say, and the more charitable among us can easily overlook a major casting error in favor of the enjoying the bigger picture.<br /><br />Take the flaming reviews with a grain of salt: this isn't the best sci-fi movie ever, but it's certainly worth checking out.

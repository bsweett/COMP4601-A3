Then I caught it on TV one day when nothing else was on.  Boy was I surprised as "Underworld" turned out to be a really good movie.  So much so that I bought "Underworld: Evolution" sight unseen.<br /><br />Beckinsale is wonderful, not just another pretty face, she actually has talent.  The rest of the cast is well cast and believable.<br /><br />Sticking to the "Rules" governing Likens and Vampires, "Underworld" will pull you in for an exciting ride as these two sides race to end war that has been going on for centuries, but to what end?<br /><br />Definately worth seeing if not owning.</p></body></html>

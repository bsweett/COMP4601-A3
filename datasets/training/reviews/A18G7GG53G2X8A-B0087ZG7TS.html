When it comes to the three main characters, there's no clear hero or villain. This is especially true of Briony Tallis: at age thirteen (Saoirse Ronan), she falsely accused her sister's lover of something he didn't do; at age eighteen (Romola Garai), her attempts to reconcile are flatly rejected. It's difficult to say whether or not her apology should have been accepted, because in all honesty, I'm not sure she deserved forgiveness. On the same token, her apology is genuine, so maybe her sister, Cecilia (Kiera Knightley), is being far too irrational. That's the beauty of this film--it doesn't pressure you into feeling one way or another about the characters. It merely presents them as they are, and how they should be perceived is left up to the individual.<br /><br />Based on Ian McEwan's novel, the story opens in England in 1935, in which Briony and Cecilia live in a sprawling countryside manor without any cares in the world. It's immediately established that Briony is an aspiring writer. This is not only because of the film's score, which uses a typewriter as a percussion instrument; the opening few shots show her typing the final few sentences of her play, one that she wishes her three visiting cousins to perform. She eventually looks out the window and misinterprets what she sees: Cecilia and Robbie Turner (James McAvoy)--the estate's gardener--are arguing in front of a large fountain, and in the course of the argument, Cecilia strips to her underwear and plunges into the water. Briony has no idea what her sister is doing, but from the look in her eyes, it's obvious she thinks Robbie has done something bad to her.<br /><br />And she uses that moment against him later on, when Robbie's error comes back to haunt him. We see the very same fountain scene from Cecilia and Robbie's point of view, which clearly shows nothing improper taking place; their argument was over something so trivial that it doesn't even bear mentioning. Later on in his room, Robbie types several drafts of an apology note. One of the drafts used some naughty language, meaning that no one was ever meant to read it. Unfortunately, Robbie mistakenly seals that draft in an envelope, after which he asks Briony to deliver it to Cecilia. Briony reads the note and concludes that Robbie is a sex maniac, a label only strengthened when she discovers him and Cecilia in an embarrassing situation. Briony also witnesses the rape of her preteen cousin, Lola (Juno Temple), and when the police arrive, she points the finger at Robbie. He's immediately arrested, and at that point, all he and Cecilia have is their love for each other.<br /><br />The story then flashes forward four years. By then, Robbie is a soldier fighting in World War II; in the midst of bullets, blood, and death, his thoughts dwell only on Cecilia, who he has only seen once since the night he was arrested. Now a nurse, Cecilia only wants Robbie to come back to her, despite the fact that his good name has forever been ruined, both socially and legally. Robbie would like nothing more, and he reminds himself of his promise as he moves from place to place with his fellow soldiers. In his mind, people and places are becoming more and more distorted, and reality seems to be slipping away from him. It could be that his longing for his lost love is so strong that all else is irrelevant. It could be that reality is so disillusioning that fantasy is all he has left. Or maybe the gaping wound on his chest has gotten infected, making his brain sick with fever. Whatever the case, Cecilia is his only source of comfort in a very uncomfortable world.<br /><br />Briony, meanwhile, has given up on college to become a nurse, like her sister. Naturally, the two haven't spoken in a few years, but because Briony now understands the magnitude of her false accusation, she tries desperately to find Cecilia and apologize. Her guilty conscience pushes her back into her writing, her first manuscript beginning with a foolish girl witnessing her sister and her sister's lover by a fountain. At this point, she doesn't know whether or not it will be finished--she tends to doubt it, not only because of the pain she feels, but also because she doesn't yet know how the story will end.<br /><br />The same tactic is used for the film's story, which concludes with an elderly Briony (Vanessa Redgrave) being interviewed about her latest novel, "Atonement." I can't describe in detail what happens, nor can I closely examine what she says; far too much would be given away. What I can say is that the ending is emotionally charged and beautifully balanced with the beginning. In essence, the entire film shows how guilt can force someone on a journey, one that doesn't necessarily lead to happiness but definitely to maturity. What a draining journey to take, for both the characters and the audience. "Atonement" is without a doubt one of the year's best films, a beautiful yet heartbreaking story of love, anger, and the notion that forgiveness is not at all easy to earn.</p></body></html>

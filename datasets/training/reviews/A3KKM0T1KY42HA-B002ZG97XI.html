Great movie!<br /><br />Earning a hard R, Hot Tub Time Machine surprised me with how amusing it actually was. I think it was helpful to go into this movie with my expectations set for an adolescent-minded sillyfest, because that's pretty much what you get albeit with some very adult themes throughout. A perfect movie for me.<br /><br />After the biggest loser of a group of 3 peas in a pod friends seemingly attempts to commit suicide, they embark on a road trip back to a place that they used to go 25 years ago to have fun in order to try to get their friend out of his funk. They find that their favorite resort town has become pretty run down over the years, which only adds to the state of depression overhanging the group. So instead of going out on the town, they get some booze and hang back at the room and hit the Hot Tub, which of course turns out to be more that just your ordinary Hot Tub.<br /><br />The boys are transported back in time and the rest of the movie is a comical and often disgusting chronicle of their fight to get back to the future without causing a Butterfly Effect that alters history. The Hot Tub Time Machine Gods picked the wrong group of guys to test the wills of humanity here.<br /><br />4 stars may be a bit generous, but if you factor in the deliberateness of the inane disposition that the movie takes, it's really well done. I laughed a lot. I winced a few times. I enjoyed it! Definitely worth a look if you can stomach some of the crudest humor that I've seen packed into about an hour and a half movie in a while.<br /><br />This is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00198X0UO">Back to the Future</a> on crack.</p></body></html>

While all the performances are above average, I found Fiennes and Watson to be the most interesting part of the film. Their tragic romance, coupled with the infamous scene w/Hoffman, help liven up what could have been a very average thriller. I thought Norton was a little ho-hum, and while I like Hopkins alot, I was somewhat disheartened to see him primarily used as comic relief. But these are actually minor flaws, and while this film is far from perfect, it generally sticks to the novel by Thomas Harris(one of the best thrillers ever written; if you haven't read the book, you should...). An enjoyable, B-grade masterpiece.</p></body></html>

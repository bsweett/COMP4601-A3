<meta name="summary" content="Underrated Movie"></head><body><p>Any fans of movies like "The Mummy Returns", "Hellboy", "The Shadow", and "Fearless Vampire Killers" might enjoy this movie. I enjoyed watching Van Helsing take on Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein, Dracula, and werewolves. Hugh Jackman gives a fine performance as the hero for mankind. Anyone that wants a serious horror movie may find this silly. It was meant to be outragious but I certainly didn't think it was silly. This is more fun to watch than several horror movies I have seen. Plenty of action and CGI effects make it visually great. The acting is decent and the directing and music are okay as well. All-in-all a good action/adventure that has a good pace, wonderful effects, and a good story. I certainly plan to add it to my DVD library long before "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" or "The Hulk".</p></body></html>

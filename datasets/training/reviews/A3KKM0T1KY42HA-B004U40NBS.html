But for what it's worth, my 2 cents is that it is a great movie. Well acted. Well scripted. And certainly well directed by the same guy that brought us <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TOD9VI">The Wrestler</a>. Like The Wrestler, Black Swan is a dark drama that gets into the psyche of its main character. Natalie Portman is the Black Swan (as well as the White Swan), and she turns in a performance worthy of her Golden Globe and Oscar wins for Best Actress.<br /><br />In a nutshell, after Portman's character wins the lead in Swan Lake, she goes a bit cuckoo and essentially morphs into a living characterization of Odile, the Black Swan. But rest assured, if you've come looking for a movie solely about dance and ballet, you will either be pleasantly surprised or completely shocked. I was the former, although I did really know in advance that what lay ahead was a dark, foreboding movie about a gal that's not quite all there.<br /><br />Speaking of dark and foreboding, gotta hand it to the film's musical score team as well. They did an expert job at building tension where there was none and making the tense moments seem more normal...well, more normal perhaps for someone losing their mind (Portman, not me!).<br /><br />Mila Kunis costars, and she is as hot as her hot and heavy scenes with Portman are. I'm not sure that Kunis' performance warranted the Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress, but she should have won the MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Kiss with Portman. Hubba hubba. Anyway....<br /><br />What I don't understand is all of the negative criticism that this movie received. I mean, even here at Amazon there are as many 1 and 2 star reviews combined as there are 5 star reviews. Makes me want to go all Odile on the 1 and 2 star reviewers and scream, "What were you expecting?!" Black Swan is an excellent movie and should not be missed by anyone into a good thriller.</p></body></html>

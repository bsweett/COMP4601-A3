It was based of a script called Star Beast by Dan O'Bannon & Ronald Shusett. But later called Alien & later rewritten by David Giler & Walter Hill. Directed by Ridley Scott who would go on to direct Blade Runner amoung many other good movies. Stars Yalpe Kotto as Parker Tom Skeritt as Dallas, Veronica Cartwright as Lambert, John Hurt as Kane Harry Dean Stanton as Brett Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley & Ian Holm as Ash. You open up to a goup of delivery people sort to speak or truckers in space. There coming back to Earth when they respond to a destress call from a downed space craft. Crew members Kane, Dallas & Lambert respond this would become known as Boneship. Kane finds these eggs then this creature jumps right out of it & of couurse this creature would become known as the Facehugger. The Facehugger attaches itself to Kane they try to bring him back Ripley says no it that it could infect the crew there is also a deleted scene where Ripley & Lambert get into a bit of a fight in the special edition version. Dallas & Ash try to get The Facehugger off Ash acts very weird during this scene. After The Facehugger does it's "work" it dies you do goet a lttle jumpscare when the dead Facehugger falls on Ripley's shoulder which it is a jumpscare this Kane wakes up later while there eating this is where we get the famous Chestburster scene that great gore effect along with Veronica Cartwright while she's almost in tears is well done. There going after The Alien Brett instead finds Ripley's cat but The Alien is right behind him & The Alien grew at a rapid rate & then Brett is killed. Dallas & Lambert try to track it down Dallas goes down to the ventalation shaft where The Alien has been hiding this scene is great Lambert is like get out of there I'm thinking the same thing like get out of there. But He is killed. Ripley is going throug the files on Mother & finds out what Ash is up to & of course this is the big rveeal that Ash is an Android & Androids would be through out the series & Ash's smile unnerving. Yalpet Kotto's reaction is pricless "Ash is a Go  d d  a  m n Robot!" Ripley is going to set the detination device Lambert & Parker are killed while getting supplies. Also in the special edition you find out that Dallas wasn't killed he is cacooned which shows that The Aliens have another way around making the eggs. The added scenes are cool but I'm going to stick with the theatricla cut. She goes after her cat which was crazy she makes her way to The Docking Bay The Alien made it there too she opens the air lock The Alien blown out it dies that's pretty much the movie. The movie runs at a slow pace but you had great charcaters that kept me involved great creature by HR Giger good direction by Ridley Scott & good atmostphere. Of course Sigourney Weaver would go on to be in the rest of the series. Tom Skerritt Yalpet Kotto Harry Dean Satanton Veronica Cartwright John Hurt Ian Holm were all good. Next I'll review my favorite of the series next time it's WAR!</p></body></html>

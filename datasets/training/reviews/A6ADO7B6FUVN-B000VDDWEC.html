<meta name="summary" content="A terrifying, yet excellent cinematic experience..."></head><body><p>When a group of Animal Rights activists raids a British research facility they have no idea what they are about to release.  28 days later, Jim (Cillian Murphy) regains consciousness and he finds himself abandoned in his hospital bed after an accident.  He quickly realizes that London is as deserted as the hospital, and he begins a small quest for signs of human life.  In his search, he encounters some ferocious characters that attempt to kill him, but he is saved by two hardened individuals.  They unveil the truth behind the disappearance of the British people.  28 Days Later... displays a vicious horror story about humanity struggling with hope and the loss of hope where the interaction between the characters brings out several philosophical notions such as existentialism, Darwinism, and love.  These viewpoints are brought to life in this dark story as Boyle conveys his intimidating message to a frightened audience.  This leaves the audience with a terrifying, yet excellent cinematic experience.</p></body></html>

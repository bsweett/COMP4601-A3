<meta name="summary" content="Oscar Worthy Performance"></head><body><p>I'm almost tempted to say Hillery Swank deserved this oscar, not only because she played her role so perfectly, but because her character was so moving...but that's just really good writing.  Hillery Swank is a gem in the film industry.  She puts herself completely into her role, pulling every ounce of life she can out of herself and spills it onto the screen.  This film as a whole was splendedly done and well worth the oscar buzz.  I would recomend this film to anyone.  Great father-daughter movie.  Be prepared to cry.</p></body></html>

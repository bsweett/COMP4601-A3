<meta name="summary" content=""How To Take A Classic Horror Film and Make A Painful Remake""></head><body><p>I love the original The Fog.  John Carpenter is one of the best horror directors of all time.  And really, who better to helm a remake of one of Carpenter's films than Rupert Wainwright, the director of MC Hammer videos and the classic film Blank Check.  Man, Hollywood sure does know what its doing with horror films these days.<br /><br />Here's the basic plot: the town of Antonio Bay, Oregon is a peaceful little town, with Selma Blair as the DJ of the town's only radio station.  I'm immediately interested.  So over the course of a couple nights, a big fog cloud rolls into the town, and with it come spirits of ghosts from sea.  The back story behind the fog isn't all that terrible, but it is executed very poorly.  The main characters are useless tools, that we care nothing about.  In fact, we aren't even told what their relationship really is, just that Elizabeth left 6 months ago, and is ready and willing to sleep with Nick on her first night back in town.  Someone cue the fog cloud of death.<br /><br />I can't live with myself as a human being and recommend this film to anyone.  Watch at your own risk.</p></body></html>

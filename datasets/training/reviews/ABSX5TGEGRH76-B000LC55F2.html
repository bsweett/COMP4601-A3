<meta name="summary" content="Prestigious"></head><body><p>This is the third film to be released in 2006 that deals with magicians and the second of the three to take place in Europe at the turn of the 20th century.  It is also the second to star Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson.  However, each film has been unique and this one is probably the best of the three (The Illusionist is a close second and Scoop is a distant third).<br /><br />Telling the story of two rival magicians over the course of a few years (starting somewhere in the 1890s and ending around 1900), The Prestige is a great story of love, revenge, duality, and mystery.<br /><br />Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) start out as assistants to a fairly prominent magician.  They are "plants"; they pretend to be audience members brought on stage to assist with a trick.  Known as the Water Escape, the magician's female assistant, who is also Angier's wife, is bound and lowered into a tank of water only to escape within seconds.  However, when Borden alters the knot he ties to make it look harder to untie, he inadvertantly causes her to drown.  This starts a bitter rivalry between Angier and Borden; they each strive to become famous magicians and outdo the other.  Angier disrupts one of Borden's shows, so Borden in turn does the same.  As the story continues, Angier hires Harry Cutter (Michael Caine), a man whose profession is to build the devices magician's use for their illusions, and Olivia Wenscombe (Johannson) to be his new assistant.  Meanwhile, Borden tends to perform shows by himself.  We soon learn that while Borden is definitely the better magician (he can instantly spot how his colleagues perform even the most baffling illusions), he is a terrible showman.  Even though his act is comprised of great illusions, he cannot keep the audience interested.  Angier on the other hand is a wonderful performer; he knows how to engage the audience and build up tricks.  However, he is nowhere near the magician that Borden is.  Despite Angier's self-realized inferiority, the rivalry continues to heat up, and despite the warnings of Cutter, Olivia, and even scientist Nichola Tesla (David Bowie) of what an obsession can do to a man, they each try to continually outdo the other.<br /><br />The story is not told linearly.  It starts out near the end with Borden being arrested, and most of the movie is a flashback due to Borden reading Angier's diary in prison.  However, there are plenty of flashbacks within the flashback, as there are scenes where Angier is describing in his diary of reading Borden's diary.  Though this may sound confusing, it is actually fairly easy to keep track of where scenes fall in continuity.  Directory Christopher Nolan, who also did the amazing Memento and Batman Begins, is a master of non-linear story-telling, and this film is no exception.<br /><br />The central mysteries of the film are very well-done; they are interesting and have good payoffs, but the best part about them is that there are enough clues for them to be figured out.  They are not easy to figure out, but keen observers may be able to piece certain things together to find the answers (I was able to put most of the stuff together, but I did miss one or two details).  This doesn't take away from the film at all, in fact it enhances it and makes it fun to try and see where things are going.<br /><br />Everything about The Prestige is well done, from the acting to the effects to the writing.  There's a reason why it was the number 1 film at the box office after its first weekend, so make sure you don't miss this.</p></body></html>

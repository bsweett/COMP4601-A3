<meta name="summary" content="Embaressingly funny"></head><body><p>The funniest movie in a long time.  The humor - all dark - shouldn't be laughed at.  Anti-semitism shouldn't be funny.  Retard jokes clearly shouldn't be funny.  Naked men running around should be funny.  But somehow Sacha Baron Cohen makes us laugh at them.  In a post-modern twist, we laugh at the morons who enjoy this humor (us) as the same time we laugh at the movie.<br /><br />Perhaps because we tell ourselves, "He's making fun of the ignorant people" we allow ourselves to laugh with him.  Or is just we are always guessing is it real?  (And how did Newt Gingrich escape without a credit?)<br /><br />If you've got any sense of humor, you'll find yourself laughing.  But perhaps this is best for DVD, where you won't be laughing out lound in public.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dark humor and casual reactions"></head><body><p>First off, the acting in this movie was great, I was very impressed with the characters and how realistic they personailities were.  However, the life changing events deplicted in the movie were just a bit too casual in reactions.  Pregnancy and growing up with that reality and the society's response was not as realistic as the movie deplicted.  I actually had to break this show up into two parts because it was just difficult to watch.  I don't plan to add this to my library.  I do look forward to watching Ellen Page continue her acting career.</p></body></html>

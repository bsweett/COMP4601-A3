<meta name="summary" content="It's Funny, But Weakened By A Few Moments"></head><body><p>"Failure To Launch" is a lightly funny romantic comedy about Tripp (Matthew McConaughey), a man-child who's still living with his parents.  His parents (gamely played by Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw), want him out of the house, so they hire Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker), to trick him into falling for her and convince him to move out of the house.  Of course, nothing goes as planned and Paula actually starts to fall for Tripp.  Meanwhile, there's a running subplot with every geek's fantasy, Kit (the lovely Zooey Deschanel), attempting to rid her home of a pesky mockingbird and trying to stop the advances of one of Tripp's buddies.<br /><br />The story moves along at a pace much better than the average romantic comedy, and although McConaughey is perfectly cast as Tripp, I feel that Sarah Jessica Parker just didn't fit well in this film.  Perhaps it's the fact that I see her as the annoying Carrie from "Sex and the City."  There are a few moments involving wildlife that try to be humorous, but are often played up a little bit too much as if the director is trying to convince the viewer that they should laugh at what's happening.  Also, there's one scene involving a bit of bare backside that just seems to be thrown in in hopes for a cheap laugh.  It doesn't fit with the rest of the film and throw off the entire plot for a few minutes.<br /><br />Other than these few moments, this is actually a pretty funny flick.  The strongest characters here aren't the leads, but co-stars Deschanel, Justin Bartha, and Bradley Cooper.  Much like every other reviewer has stated, these actors make the entire film watchable.  From Deschanel's bizarre yet sexy moodswings to the gung-ho mentality of eternal slacker, Demo, to the innocence of programmer, Ace, it all works perfectly for some humorous sequences.  Heck, just the names, Kit, Ace, and Demo, are funny.  Bates and Bradshaw seemed to be having fun during the making of this flick, that comes through on the screen.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, McConaughey does a great job with what he's got to work with.  The only misfire here is Parker, who isn't as funny as the rest of the gang.<br /><br />Probably more deserving of three-and-a-half stars than four, check out "Failure to Launch" as a rental before putting down too much money for it.</p></body></html>

It's not because she is anti-American, or that she fakes a British accent every chance she gets, it's not even because she named her children Apple and Moses therefore subjecting them to a lifetime of fruit and biblical jokes. I don't like her because she is not a good actress, it's as simple as that, and it's all my opinion of course because some people think she is the next Meryl Streep (laughs uncontrollably). Having stated this, I will say that I loved this Movie! Yes, I could even look past Miss Paltrow to see the merits of this film. I had seen the coming attractions, and said "no" because of Gwyneth, even though it looked really interesting. Finally I broke down and told myself "it has robots, and planes, and Jude and Angelina" and in the universe that I live in all those things counteract her. She isn't horrible in this, she is just as staccato, and blank faced as she usually is, but it works for her character. Jude Law is okay, as well as Angelina, the script really didn't allow for any Oscar moments, the REAL star of this movie was the Special Effects. The whole movie was just gorgeous and creative; it's like no movie I have ever witnessed. If you are a fan of old black and white movies, classic Sci Fi and just plain originality you will love it.</p></body></html>

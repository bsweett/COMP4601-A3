<meta name="summary" content="Sunny new Pixar gem... with all the extra goodies one could ever want!"></head><body><p>Now while "UP" did not make my #1 Pixar movie of all time (which is "Ratatouille", by the way) it certainly is one literally uplifting little delight with sparkling animation, lovable characters, and rip-roaring adventure.<br /><br />Carl Frederickson is a retired balloon salesman and widower.  With the threat of urban sprawl and a court-ordered move to a retirement villa, Carl takes ties balloons to his house and takes off for a long-awaited trip to Paradise Falls.  But unbeknownst to him he has also accidentally carried off local scout Russell.  Despite efforts to return the annoying kid to the ground, the two quickly arrive at the intended destination. Convenient? I prefer to consider it plot device, and it certainly opens for the adventure that is the rest of the movie.<br /><br />The animation is beautiful, and this is one of those movies that simply look better in sparkling Blu-Ray.  It's a funny, heartfelt, and moving story.<br /><br />And yes, it is worth is to buy the Blu-Ray. I'm not always the biggest fan of all those silly extras, but the documentaries and other production thoughts are nearly as entertaining as the feature presentation.<br /><br />Definitely a keeper.</p></body></html>

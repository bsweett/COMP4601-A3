For the most part, that is exactly what it was.  I loved the Godfather, but too many flaws in this film prevented me from enjoying it nearly as much.<br /><br />First, the good points.  Viggo Mortensen was superb in the role of Nikolai.  His accent sounded good, and he fit the part well.  His reserved demeanor and soft-spoken dialog lull a viewer until he erupts into surprising violence. The oft-mentioned sauna scene where he fights naked is both shocking and realistic.  It was graphic violence that I could not look away from, and fully illustrated the dangerous world he was living in.  In fact, there is very little violence but when it does pop up, it is almost always shocking because the rest of the film was so slow.  This is not an in your face gangster movie; at times it was plodding.  The producers did an excellent job of developing and maintaining the mystery of Nikolai.  What are his motivations?  Who is he?  When it was finally revealed, it was a nice twist.  Plus, I loved the parts about the tattoos and their meaning.  It really added something to the film.  Finally, the setting and lighting were fabulous.  The movie was visually, as well as thematically, gritty.  I felt like I was in London, in a Russian neighborhood.<br /><br />However, the movie had many problems.  First, I agree with some reviewers that Naomi Watt's character was too one-dimensional and unbelievably stupid.  What ordinary person upon hearing what's in that diary rushes out to verbally attack a mobster!?  Come on!  Especially in light of her father fleeing Russia and possibly the KGB.  The second problem, and by far the more serious, was the dialog in Russian.  I would hazard a guess that at least 35% of the dialog in in Russia - with no subtitles.  I watched this On Demand with my family, and we wondered if it was supposed to have subtitles after all?  If not, what a bad choice.  A few lines here and there to build authenticity and remind viewers of the subject would have been fine.  But, entire conversations where I had no clue what they were saying and no body language to convey the meaning either?  This was one problem that I could not overcome.  Some of my family found the movie boring, and I think this is a direct cause.  How interesting can it be to watch people talk in a language you don't speak?  And the ending.  I couldn't agree more with all the viewers that hated it.  It was not only unrealistic, it left viewers wondering, "That's it!? Wait, what happened to...?"  I felt like I was at the end of "Kill Bill V1" only no VII is forthcoming.<br /><br />Overall, this movie could have been fantastic despite the slow pace.  Instead, it was disappointing.  It was worth seeing for Viggo (and that unbelievable bath house scene), but rent it, don't buy.</p></body></html>

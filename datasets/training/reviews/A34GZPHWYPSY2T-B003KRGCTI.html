<meta name="summary" content="The longest review you'll ever read--SPOILERS!!"></head><body><p>MAJOR, MAJOR SPOILER ALERT, BUT IT'S WAY DOWN LOW....<br /><br />"If you plan on seeing this movie, do not tell anyone...."<br />-Roger Ebert, review<br /><br />One can never watch post-apocalyptics without reference to the MAD MAX series, THE POSTMAN, and others I have mentioned in other reviews. People in these worlds are either sci-fi cannibals, communists or anarchist psychopaths.<br /><br />In the first 20 minutes of THE BOOK OF ELI I saw all that and more. Looked awfully familiar. Nearly put me off watching it through...but something kept nagging me, saying this was different. How right that nag was! It even lulled me into thinking the film would be 100% predictable.<br /><br />It is not.<br /><br />For those too young to appreciate all the films that are paid homage here, it is useless for me to mention any other than what I already did above. In brief: Eli (Denzel Washington, man, what a superhero) is a "walker", a wanderer through a post-apocalyptic world. His mission is to "go west"--and he carries sacred cargo: a Bible, King James Version, the last in the world. We learn from Eli that "after the flash, they were all burned", because many believed the Bible "caused" the "flash". Apparently, it tore most of the ozone away also.<br /><br />Eli demonstrates some survival skills apparently taught to him straight from heaven. In fact, that will be part of my spoiler...be warned. He wanders into a town looking for a recharge for his music storage unit, which is identified as a Fathom 900, not seen since the 1990s. Since I don't know, I'll take the movie's word for it (or rather Tom Waits, who plays the shopkeeper/repairman).<br /><br />Eli encounters Carnegie (Gary Oldman), a sort of Boss Tweed if you can call him that--actually a rotten gang leader who has everyone else do his dirty work. He does not match THE POSTMAN's General Bethlehem, but then, he is a different sort of chap. He discovers Eli has a...THE...Bible. He wants it. At any cost.<br /><br />So far this film is really quite fun with all its homages and one suddenly sees it is purely a kung fu film married to Clint Eastwood's man with no name. But wait! There's more!<br /><br />After becoming entangled with young Solara (the wonderful Mila Kunis) and her blind mother Claudia (a great turn by Jennifer Beals, still beautiful as ever), Eli continues west. Solara follows him, so he has no choice but to let her tag along...shades of Zatoichi, anyone?<br /><br />But wait, there's still more!! After a hilarious visit with cannibals George (Sir Michael Gambon) and his wife Martha (Frances de la Tour) and fighting off Carnegie's pursuit, after some atmospheric K-PAX style music and some sagging monochromatic moments, yet with the best cinematography I've seen in years, Eli and Solara find their way to San Francisco. They are bound for Alcatraz, apparently the place to which God told Eli he must go.<br /><br />Eli has been shot in the belly by Carnegie, but he has the strength to go onward. He has already been forced to give Carnegie the Bible, which is kept locked. Eli is dying, on the way to Alcatraz, and Carnegie has the Bible. You THINK you know what's coming, eh?<br /><br />== SPOILER WARNING ==<br /><br />Carnegie finds he needs Claudia more than ever...because the Bible is in Braille. Eli, it transpires, is blind.<br /><br />Even to the end of the film, it isn't overtly stated, but it is there for those who will notice it. Then the film rushes back into your memory...didn't he see this?...didn't he notice that?...but a blind person could do all those things. It was always vital that no one know Eli was blind. He must have been blinded in the flash or by the sun afterwards.<br /><br />Arriving at Alcatraz, he finds a cultural center which he of course mistakes for a museum (THE POSTMAN homage again). The curator, Lombardi--a great uncredited cameo by Malcolm McDowell--tells Eli they are preserving humanity in order to redistribute it again. In a homage to FARENHEIT 451, Eli tells Lombardi to take a pen and write his dictation. He then dictates the Bible perfectly.<br /><br />As Eli lay dying, finishing his dictation, he is ritually shaved and enrobed in what appears to be a Muslim priest's robe (this is the 2nd reference to Eli being some kind of Middle Eastern Christian; the 1st reference is his Arabic scarf which he trades for water). I cannot figure this part out at all, but it's clear Eli is some kind of post-apocalyptic priest and blind. It was odd because very early we see nestled in his backpack a name tag: "Hi My name is ELI", it says beneath a K-Mart-type logo. In the end, his 'successor' is Solara, who wanders back out as Eli once wandered. She even takes his sword-machete.<br /><br />This film is a ZATOICHI remake after all!<br /><br />I love the power of the Bible in this film. As a theologian, it cuts to the chase: few know what the Bible is, let alone what it says. Even Eli has failed to grasp its context. It has caused trouble before: Carnegie recalls when humankind was enslaved by evildoers using the Bible...which is what he wants to do. The Bible tells us that no one else can even comprehend who Eli is. A simple man, yet the most important man on earth, martyred but not before his job is done.<br /><br />Early in the film, Carnegie gets what he says is "the last shampoo on earth" for his blind girlfriend. I was moved that ELi is the last Christian on earth, albeit a shaky, self-guided one.<br /><br />Eli has the millennia-old set of books in his mind. That is the main power of which I speak. Eli gives the world, once again, the Bible. I love how it is finally printed and nestled in an Alcatraz shelf (showing it is from "Alcatraz Press") between Stone's TANAKH (that is the Jewish/Hebrew Bible--I own one of those) and the Holy Qu'uran. This film is full of such details and savory cinematic moments. Then again, I wondered at the sad fact that they printed the King James Bible and shelved it. No one read it and I didn't see copies being distributed. How sad.<br /><br />And as I said, it is a remake of the ZATOICHI films, and it takes a lot from those incomparable films of the 1960s. See it. Buy it. Do not blink, even during the sagging moments, because that is when Denzel shows the acting he learned from Shintaro Katsu, the original Zatoichi. Don't miss the sword moves, again copied directly from Ichi movies.<br /><br />Most of all, don't miss the true message and symbolism of the Bible this film offers. You can be an atheist and appreciate it.</p></body></html>

Another man follows him to threaten him into revealing a secret. Elsewhere a man speaks about symbols. The police ask him to look at a picture of a man. Elsewhere that killer makes his report. You know he is weird when he punishes himself. Robert Langdon visits a glass pyramid in Paris to talk about the victim. A telephone message tells him he is in great danger. A visitor goes to Saint-Sulpice. Someone placed a "tracking dot" on Langdon."Who are you?" Langdon escapes, but is tracked. Or is he? That Fibonacci code was scrambled. An anagram? What is the "Priory of Sion"? There is a car chase to wake up the viewer. [Are you confused by the plot?] Silas searches for an item. Is it connected to the "Holy Grail"? [Is this a weird movie so far?]<br /><br />The bishop holds a secret meeting. Elsewhere Sophie talks about family history. There is another strange event, then a man with a gun. Sophie and Robert go to visit Lee, an Englishman who lives in France. Silas learns of their destination. The Priory protects the source of the Church's power on earth - the Holy Grail. [How honest is that history of Constantine?] Interpreting the facts to support a point of view? Can an old painting really tell the facts? Or another example of seeing what you want to see? [No wonder people objected to this movie.] That "Malleus Maleficarum" was used for witch-hunting in Renaissance times. The TV news shows Sophie and Robert as murderers on a killing spree. A small box contains a cylinder with rotating wheels, like an old-time coding device. There is a surprising attack! The police are outside and soon enter. But Sophie and Robert escape in a car with Lee.<br /><br />"Opus Dei" is a conservative group that works for the Vatican. Is there another group that kills its imagined enemies? Fache learns of their air flight plan. A "Messenger of God"? [Isn't that like saying King Herod was doing God's work?] Elsewhere men talk about destroying a sarcophagus. What about an heir (or heiress)? A sacrifice for the betterment of humanity? Robert finds an engraved metal disk in that wooden box, another clue. They are making history now. Switzerland does not allow extradition. Fache is Opus Dei, his bishop games him orders. Breaking his vow? Will the police intercept them in London? "Start with him." Scotland Yard is prepared to shoot. "The French can't be trusted." Will the police follow their car? There is a surprise in the Templar Church in London. Can they escape?<br /><br />There is another surprise in the car. Will Silas be blessed? Will the other man get his reward? Who was Alexander Pope? There are marks in the dust. [Does this contradict the cleanliness of this building?] Lee shows up and "knows too much". There is a shooting at that Opus Dei house. "We are betrayed." They use a cell phone to trace its calls. Is Sophie the guardian of the grail? "Open the cryptex!" There is another surprise before the police arrive. Does Lee's talk sound crazy? They visit an old church. "Where did she go?" Men arrive. Sophie tells about her past. Another riddle solved. Is Sophie descended from the Merovingian Kings? Royal blood? [Isn't this all just too fantastic?] Can you believe the ending? Robert gets a clue from a book. Its too fantastic for words.<br />This movie reminds me of "The 39 Steps" for its chases, and "The Maltese Falcon" for its search for a treasure that isn't there. There are some interesting scenes but this is a worthless story.</p></body></html>

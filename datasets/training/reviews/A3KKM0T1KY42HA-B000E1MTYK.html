<meta name="summary" content="I'm Just Wild About Harry"></head><body><p>I spent the equivalent of a full day's waking-hours in front of my big screen TV this past winter break with just the 2 sets of the four Harry Potter movies and the three Lord of the Rings movies. I am NOT a couch potato. I am NOT a couch potato. I am NOT a couch potato.<br /><br />Well, at least it was time well spent. Finally...some movies that really make the grade. I've been hard-pressed to find a good 5-star movie that I haven't seen. And here I've had these two sets of films that have been out there all this time that that for whatever reason I've had an aversion to. Silly me.<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire were all at minimum very good. Certainly Socerer's Stone, Chamber and Goblet of Fire are as 5-star as it gets. Azkaban was relatively slow compared to the others, but look at the footsteps that it had to follow in.<br /><br />The list of A-list actors giving A-list performances goes on....You have Richard Harris (GRHS) who was flawlessly and un-noticably (no disrespect intended) replaced by Michael Gambon; Miranda Richardson, Gary Oldman, there's Alan Rickman doing his best Jeremy Irons imitation, Ralph Fiennes, John Hurt, Shirley Henderson, John Cleese and of course Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. I know I'm forgetting more, but you get the idea.<br /><br />Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber were brilliantly led by the direction of Veteran Chris Columbus (Home Alone and tons more). And the cast of these films?...How often do three unknowns (Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley) walk into overnight stardom? Not very. But these three sure did. And it's well deserved. Their characters are well acted and believable; not bad for a bunch of preteens in their debuts.<br /><br />Azkaban was really good and certainly an integral part of the Harry Potter progression of stories. But Azkaban was the first hand-off of the director baton from Columbus to the short resumed, mostly-foreign-film-guy Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n. Columbus still had oversight as a producer, so perhaps Cuar&oacute;n felt intimidated by Columbus' brilliance in Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber...or perhaps Cuar&oacute;n just held back from doing his own thing. Be that as it may, the change in "direction" really shone through. And Cuar&oacute;n was gone for Goblet.<br /><br />Goblet comes in with three changes in direction: 1) The director change from Cuar&oacute;n back to another vet in Mike Newell, 2) The exit of Columbus oversight, and 3) A shift from...shall we say...a more famlyish Harry Potter to a more dark Harry Potter (the way it was intended!). And this did not go un-noticed by the MPAA.<br /><br />It's must be tough to make a PG movie these days; it's hard to believe that the MPAA took the Potter series from a PG rating to a PG-13 rating for Goblet. Kids 13 and under can see uglier violence and hear more profanity at school recess and at the local playground than they do in Goblet...better start a rating system for playgrounds! How is it that a movie like Goblet without a curse-word or graphic act of violence (by today's standards anyway) gets thrown into the same category as, for example, S.W.A.T. (2003) that does indeed not only have the F-word, but strong violence and sex? Ludicrous. But I won't get started on how unfair the MPAA is and how neurotically insane the pressure is from certain groups on the MPAA to "protect" our youth.<br /><br />I will indeed finish by saying that the first four of the Harry Potter releases combined have grossed close to $2,000,000,000 (that's a TWO BILLION dollars) because they're excellent movies that kids can watch too. And Goblet actually did better at the box office than Azkaban. So stick that in your pipe and smoke it, MPAA.<br /><br />If you somehow missed these movies as I did for some crazy reason, I hope that my long-winded review has encouraged you to add them to your cart. As for Lord of the Rings...well that's another review entirely, of course.<br /><br />I can't wait for the upcoming continuation of the Harry Potter series with Order of the Phoenix in 2007 and Half-Blood Prince in 2008. I am NOT a couch potato.</p></body></html>

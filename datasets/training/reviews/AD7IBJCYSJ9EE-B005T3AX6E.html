<meta name="summary" content="One of the best movies I've seen in awhile."></head><body><p>I watched this last night. Boy, was I amazed! Pulp Fiction is the 2nd film by Quentin Tarantino, who also made the entertaining Kill Bill movies.<br /><br />  SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br /> The story tells about a crime gang and their adventures. The first story is about one of the hitmen, Vincent, taking care of the boss's wife, Mia, while he's gone. [Mia is played by Uma Thurman, the same person who played The Bride in KB. She looks WAY different in this movie!] But, oops! Mia takes some strong drugs and passes out, with halarious results!<br /><br /> The second is about a boxer who betrayed the crime boss and is now hiding from him. Later, the boss and the boxer run into two Michael Jackson like rednecks! Uh-oh!!!!<br /><br /> The third has to do with the hitmen accidentaly shooting a person in their car and now they have to take it up to a friends. After cleaning it up, they go to a coffe shop, and run into two robbers!<br /><br /> A little note: I think the order of the stories are this: 3, 1,2.<br /><br />  END SPOILERS<br /><br /> The stories are SLIGHTLY out of order, mostly the third story. The swearing, well, lots! F words all over! Even the N word here and there! Pretty violent too.<br /><br /> The dialouge, BRILLIANT! Lots of spicy discussions and topics. Like candy. The acting is great too. Entertaining, amusing, action! This film rocks! If you haven't seen it yet, well do so, NOW! One of the best movies ever!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An honest love story"></head><body><p>Based on the original play by Patrick Marber, Mike Nichols delivers an interesting adaptation which only flaw seems to be that play like feeling in some parts of the movie.  `Closer' tells the story of four people whose lives get connected to one another's in the most dysfunctional ways.<br /><br />I had never seen a movie about relationships that portrayed so realistically all the ups and downs. The movie opens with Dan and Alice meeting and falling in love in a quite traditional and romantic way, with the beautiful `Blower's daughter' in the background. Going from there we get to see a story of betrayal and a well earned lack of trust in the relationships of these four characters. I won't give away the plot like many other reviewers already did, but these characters are lovable even when they have no respect for anything, even when they break the hearts of the ones that love them.<br /><br />The approach to relationships in this story is crude and erotic, there are situations in which the dialogues will just blow you away, and these moments are mostly because of the well chosen cast and a very good direction. Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Clive Owen and even Julia Roberts deliver some  moments that are sometimes hard to digest and/or believe, the discussions and the openness of the things they say one another are great contributions to the story.<br /><br />Like said before, the only apparent flaw this movie has is the use of the timeframes, one moment you are watching a regular sequence and in the next cut a year has passed already, with no explanation at all, you will have to guess based on the situations and the subtle changes perceived (forget about titles saying `One year later', there's nothing of that here) This situation can make it difficult to some people to watch and understand completely the film. Other than that, the direction, photography and performance of the cast are breathtaking.<br /><br />The movie has no extras at all (I do not consider previews for other films as extras, hope you agree) besides Damien Rice's music video for `The Blower's daughter', which will be enough for fans of the film. The sound comes in a decent Dolby Digital 5.1 audio and is presented in tis original widescreen format.</p></body></html>

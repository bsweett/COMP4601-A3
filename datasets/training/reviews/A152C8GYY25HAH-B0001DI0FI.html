<meta name="summary" content="An outstanding movie acheivement"></head><body><p>"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" is probably the best movie ever made about life aboard an early 19th Century naval vessel. There is an epic storytelling quality here that is reminiscent of  classics like "Lawrence of Arabia" and "The Bridge on the River Kwai". It also has a grace and elegance not often seen in movies - epic or otherwise - these days. <p>Ironically, all these fine qualities may have limited its commercial appeal. The bulk is the movie is about the two main characters - Capt. Jack Aubrey [Russell Crowe] and the ship's surgeon, Dr. Stephen Maturin [Paul Bettany] and their relationship with each other and with the rest of the crew. There are only two major battles scenes, which, while impressive, run only a few minutes each. <p>Capt. Aubrey is commander of the Surprise, a rather small and outdated British vessel. The Napoleonic Wars are in full swing, and England is in danger of invasion by the French. Aubrey and crew are off the coast of Brazil, where they spot a very fast and modern French ship. Aubrey decides to pursue it, and the chase takes him all the way around the tip of South America to the Galapolos Islands off the coast of Chile. There, the final confrontation between the two vessels takes place.<p>Crowe and Bettany are superb as two friends whose differences make them perfect counterpoints. To those who are more into narrative than action, watching these two play off each other is the highlight of the movie. <p>"Master and Commander" is marvelous entertainment and quite possibly the best big studio movie of 2003.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another mess....(spoilers here)"></head><body><p>OF course, you must at least enjoy the horror genre a little bit to watch a movie like this. Otherwise, it is pointless to review it. Any horror movie will be a zero star movie if you don't liek the genre.<br /><br />Since I moderately enjoy the genre, I'm apt to give my review. This is another mess suffering from this plague that is video / commercial directors debuting in movies. Produced by Michael "Gloss" Bay, this movie is intended to shock, make you tremble, make you feel disgusting. And it manages to do so, but achieving something of a miracle for this sort of movie: in just thirty minutes into it, you will find yourself CARING for the characters - future victims! I felt myself really annoyed and sad when each of the kis were murdered by that crazy killer, I loathed each one of members of his family, I felt a genuine pleasure when our girl run over the bad sheriff, with a car, three times!!<br /><br />But, at the same time, I shivered while I realized how this is an ugly, atrocious movie. The movie puts you down, there are none of the usual jokes you find in these movies. It's utter bloody, serious and without hope for the characters.</p></body></html>

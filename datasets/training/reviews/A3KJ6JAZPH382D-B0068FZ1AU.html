The Musical Based on the Songs of ABBA,</a> has a lot going for it. The least of which is the immensely likable songs of ABBA, which anchor the movie with familiarity. The scenery is gorgeous and the cast is packed with exuberance and cheer. Then again, at 59, Meryll Streep steals the film with her presence as the former girl-group singer retired to an island resort. Packed with good cheer, great music and eye catching dance numbers, "Mamma Mia" is as frothy and glittery as the foam riding the tops of an island wave. But it's also just about as substantial.<br /><br />As Donna, Streep just shimmers. Her gal-pals Tanya (Christine Baranski) and Rosie (Julie Waters) each have scene stealing moments. When Tanya lets loose on a flirtatious younger man with "Does Your Mother Know," it's one of the funniest bits in the movie. As Sophie, Amanda Seyfried carries her songs probably better than anyone here. Even as she is the focal point of "Mamma Mia," the story is ultimately Streep's. It is Donna's crisis of parenthood (the flimsy set-up where Sophie invites her three probable fathers to her wedding) that forms the crux of the movie. The musical numbers spin off in all direction, not always conducive to the plot.<br /><br />Be that as it may, we watched the "sing-along" version of the film is great fun, and Streep's version of "The Winner Takes It All" is a show-stopper. I also defy you not to sing along to either "Dancing Queen" or "Waterloo" (done as a campy finale with the principals in ABBA period costumes). Also noted, none of the male leads can sing worth a lick, although the story that Brosnan didn't know he was being cast in a musical is pretty funny (he was approached with the offer to play a male lead in a movie with Meryll Streep, then was told what the movie was AFTER he accepted). But if you accept "Mamma Mia" for what it is, a big hunk of feel-good fun, you won't come away disappointed.<br /><br />Now where is that Movie adaptation of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009ILC4">We Will Rock You</a>?</p></body></html>

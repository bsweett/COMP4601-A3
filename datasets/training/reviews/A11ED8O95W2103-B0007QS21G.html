<meta name="summary" content="Fell asleep while watching and woke up the day after."></head><body><p>Thankfully I didn't sleep until the day after tomorrow.  I watched - or tried to watch anyway - this big budget piece of environmentalist propaganda because it had reached the "everyone has seen it but me" kind of critical mass so that I was compelled to see it just so I can say I had.<br /><br />I loved the opening scene when the driller guy is standing there while a huge crack formes in an ice shelf and ends up separating him from his colleagues.  This was just like an "Ice Age" movie, but with a human and his ice cores rather than a squirrel and an acorn.  But it was downhill from there on.  The problem wasn't that I'm a bit skeptical of the whole global warming thing (at least the part where humans did it and humans can fix it) but rather that I found the characters so dull.  Spectacular effects cannot make up for boring characters, at least not for me.  So, I'll be returning this movie to where I rented it from today, not the day after tomorrow.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Gothic, Action-Packed Romeo & Juliet"></head><body><p>I don't know about you guys, but I love the Underworld series. This series, along with Blade is what made me a fan of vampires films. Before then, I wrote them off because most of them are love stories. What I failed to realize it that they should be love stories, and I had a misconception of what vampires were all about. Abraham ("Bram") Stroker's original Dracula novel from 1897 was a love story through and through. Even Underworld is a love story at heart. The same argument could be made for Blade, since his love for his mother, and hatred for the monsters that stole her from him is what drove his quest for vengeance. Underworld is more like a Gothic Romeo and Juliet. The difference, and it's a big one, is that the second sexiest actress in the world stars as Selene. The first being Scarlett Johansson. And not only is the lead sexy, but the co-stars are two of my favorite British actors. I love Michael Sheen, and Bill Nighy is amazing. If Simon Pegg and Ian McKellen were in this, I don't know what I would do will all of that British awesomeness. Yes, I love the cast, but the action is pretty good in this movie as well. Comparisons to The Matrix have been made countless times. I don't blame anyone for doing so. Over the course of the franchise, Underworld has found its niche, and moved away from such comparisons.<br /><br />The finale  in the first Underworld is quite well done, in my opinion. I do happen to love werewolves as well. They are only my favorite movie monsters in cinema history. In fact, I just recently watched An American Werewolf In London because I did not feel right calling myself a fan of the beast, not having seen "The Best Werewolf Movie Of All-Time". That said, I don't think they were at their best in this one. They moved too slow to me. I appreciate prostetics over CGI, but make it more believable at least. There is no way a real werewolf would walk straight at someone that slowly if they were shooting at, or whipping it. I can't hold that against the film too much though, because that's only of sign of Underworld's lower budget, especially compared to its sequels. Van Helsing, while it isn't the best film, has some of my personal favorite werewolves. That said, I still enjoyed the R&J-esque story, and how it combined the already connected lores.<br /><br />The story is aided wonderfully by the dark tone and visuals. The gothic look was used perfectly. The vampires' home was a particularly well done set piece. As was the final set where the last fight took place. Speaking of that particular fight, I think it was a tad too short, but the choreography was nicely paced. It allowed you to see every detail, but it didn't move too slowly. I can say that for the entire film actually. The pacing is great, and the lack of quick-cuts allow to to become immersed in the Underworld universe. As a fan of the entire series, I may be biased. I can admit that I see the films' flaws, but still find much more to love in them. I don't blame anyone for not liking these movies, but I don't get the hate. I think it's a lot better than the reception it has received, and certainly worth a watch for anyone who likes vampires or werewolves. Also, you see how easy it is to write a review for vampire/werewolf love stories without bashing Twilight? Yes, it's very easy indeed. I think Twilight is just a female's version of this story. Even though the lead is a female, it is still a movie, or series that caters to a large male audience. And there isn't much that needs to be said for the picture and audio quality of the Blu-rays. Each film in the series is pretty much reference quality. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

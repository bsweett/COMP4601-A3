Then Indy IV was eventually released to only mediocre reception but thankfully still has some of the original flare to save it from absolute failure. The truth is that Indy IV comes very close to not only being the worst of the four Indy movies, but a low point for Spielberg in general. In short, The Temple of Doom is better than this. So what went wrong and what saves it?<br /><br />It suffers a bit from Phantom Menace syndrome. The decade long hype nowhere nears pays-off and neither does the secrecy. It is not an original story. In short it looks taken from an Erik Von Daniken chapter on `ancient aliens' combined with X Files: The Movie and maybe even `Predator'. All of the other hyped proposals, Atlantis etc., sounded a way better and probably would have been. So the story is maybe a letdown.  Then we have the bad guys, pesky Russians. This is the 21st century and that is the best we can do? The Russians? Okay so maybe it's keeping in tune with typical Indy stereotype bad-guys but it just doesn't pack the same kind of punch that it would have done say in 1980, but in 2008 it is positively lame. Then we have the new kid who does a lot of Indy's fighting for him. Okay so Harrison is old, but he is not that old and this is an Indy picture and really this is what saves the day... Indy.<br /><br />Harrison doing Indy hasn't changed and that is what rescues this film. He hasn't changed one bit, not one iota, even though he might look older, he has all the moves, one-liners, facial expressions and kicks. Whenever Indy is on the screen, Indy IV is great. Also Indy IV is heavy on archaeology and that gives it an edge that maybe Temple lacked. The action sequences are not bad although there are some questionable graphics during the jungle fight. At least Indy IV gets right into the action within the first few minutes and continues right through to the end. There is also a classic gag with a snake.<br /><br />So all in all, Indy IV is only ok, it is watchable, but for people who have invested in this series (and who hasn't) or followed the hype with anticipation will wonder what has gone wrong with the kind of mentally stimulating exciting movies that Spielberg and Lucas once had going. It almost paves the way for the new generation directors to make the most out of the missing blockbusters. Yet again thinking of 2008, they have haven't they?... and that's the point. Maybe we have been spoiled by better films and better Indy's, some of them by the director/producer duo that brought us this, but at the same time I cannot see the 1 or 2 star reviews being wrong about this motion picture. I am being generious with 3. It is kinda sad too thinking that there will probably not be another one. It feels like the end of an era.</p></body></html>

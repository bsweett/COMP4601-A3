<meta name="summary" content="A Grittier Mission Impossible. But Still Action-Packed."></head><body><p>"Mission Impossible III" opens boldly with the film's emotional climax: Impossible Mission Force agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is tortured, restrained, desperately trying to convince someone that something called "the rabbit's foot" is authentic. His foe is Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a blackmarket dealer in everything illicit, who is holding a woman at gunpoint, ready to kill her if Ethan doesn't deliver the mysterious "rabbit's foot". This third installment in Tom Cruise's "Mission Impossible" franchise is directed by J.J. Abrams in a grittier style than its sleek predecessors: The fistfights are knock-down and drag-out. The camera moves a lot -though it thankfully does not shake. The cinematography is generally darker, often using indirect light.<br /><br />The action doesn't suffer, though. We get 5 action/fight sequences, a couple of them pretty exciting. It's fun to see Philip Seymour Hoffman in a villain role. Tom Cruise is joined again by Ving Rhames as technology wizard Luther. Hawaiian-born Asian star Maggie Q is a new addition to the IMF team as Zhen Lei, along with Irish hunk Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as the improbably named Declan Gormley. When Agent Lindsey Ferris (Keri Russell) is abducted by the nefarious Owen Davian, Ethan Hunt takes a hiatus from his training job and his fiancee (Michelle Monaghan) to return to the field to rescue Ferris. But there may be more to the mission than meets the eye, as Agent Ferris has left Ethan a clue to something -but what?- in the form of a microdot on a postcard sent from Berlin.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2006 single disc edition): Bonus features include "The Making of the Mission"  documentary, 5 Deleted Scenes, a Tom Cruise tribute presentation (9 min) that was shown at the 2005 BAFTA ceremony when Cruise received the Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award for Excellence in Film, and an audio commentary by actor/producer Tom Cruise and director/co-writer J.J. Abrams. The commentary is conversational but continuous. Abrams talks about film structure, production design, locations, editing, what's CGI and what's not, stunts. He and Cruise discuss performances, filming scene-by-scene, and more. A nicely paced commentary with lots of information.</p></body></html>

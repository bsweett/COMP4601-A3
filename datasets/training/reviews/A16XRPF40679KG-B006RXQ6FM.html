<meta name="summary" content="top performances abound here."></head><body><p>You have 62 reviews on this A budget movie with it's incredible<br />powerhouse performances and most of them rightly gave this movie great reviews.  I can't understand a review of less than three stars though.  Anyway the movie like the play makes you think hard about Doubt and inspite of the outcome of the movie we are left with incertitude that the lead character is in fact a abuser , maybe he just didn't want to have other issues dragged up in his past.  Who knows? the viewer may assume that the priest is guilty or not but the fierce performance of Meryl Streep leads us NO doubt that her character really does care about the welfare of the children in her school; even if she doesn't show it in a loving way. The movie does have alot of dialog but watching it, was to me like looking back in time, in a pretty much faithful way, to that era of history fairly accurately.  The early sixties were a time before the storm and people still were in denial about many issues and they certainly had a hard time talking about them.  This is a excellent drama and should stand the test of time because of it's great performances and<br />doubtful musings and endings.  The print looks beautiful on blu ray and every detail stands out nicely in this perfect print.  This is a movie that is a acting tour de force and blu ray is only way to go if you want to own this.</p></body></html>

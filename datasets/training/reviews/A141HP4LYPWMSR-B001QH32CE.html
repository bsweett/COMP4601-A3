<meta name="summary" content=""Gonna Make A Pie" ~ Marriage, Pregnancy, Romance and Being Happy Enough"></head><body><p>Synopsis: `Waitress' is a dark, bittersweet comedy about a cute waitress in a small town who creates the most heavenly pies imaginable. She concocts a new recipe everyday, one that generally reflects her current mood and circumstances as they exist at that moment. Trapped in a bad marriage to a controlling, insecure male (Jeremy Sisto) Jena (Keri Russell) tries to hold her life together relying on her culinary creations and friends at the diner to add some semblance of meaning to her existence.<br /><br />Just when her plan of running away and starting fresh somewhere else seems plausible she becomes pregnant and must re-evaluate what to do. A trip to the obstetrician to confirm her pregnancy adds more confusion and emotional angst to the situation when she discovers her old doctor has retired and has been replaced by the handsome Doctor Pomatter (Nathan Fillion). Sparks soon fly between the two and the future is now more uncertain than ever.<br /><br />Critique: While primarily a "chick flick" I found this film to have a subtly about itthat was quite appealing as it looked at the drudgery of life in a loveless, dysfunctional marriage from a woman's viewpoint. There is quite a bit of depth and insight revealed within this very well conceived storyline a some good lessons to be learned such as; life was never intended to be a party and sometimes being "happy enough" is enough.</p></body></html>

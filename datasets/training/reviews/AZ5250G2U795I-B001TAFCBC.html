Joel is recovering from a breakup from his girlfriend Clementine.  The pain is mounting, when he runs into his former love and is further jarred by her inability to show him the slightest recognition.  She isn't just giving him the cold shoulder:  she has no concept who he is.  Through a mixup, Joel discovers Clementine has had him 'erased' from her memory, and he figures this to be a terrific remedy for his heartbreak.  He discovers, during the erasing process, that some memories should stay, and he and the Clementine of his mind work desperately to hide her by incorporating her into other memories of his. The way the story weaves past and present is complicated but engaging.<br /><br />What this movie does BRILLIANTLY examine is what happens to the good memories if we throw out the bad, and how intricately both are woven together.  It also questions how important are experiences we live through in terms of our destiny?  Can we really 'erase' those who fate has put in our paths?  Are the bad memories worth erasing if it means the good go with it?  These are very interesting questions 'Eternal' poses.<br /><br />And I doubt any other actor could have served 'Eternal' well as Joel.  Carrey gives a career best performance as the heartbroken Joel, and it's a performance filled with perfectly nuanced pain.  It's just captivating how Carrey gives Joel a desperation that is never whiney or pathetic.  He's just a man broken by love and looking for the quickest way out of it.<br /><br />Winslet proves she is one of the most talented actresses of her generation in a performance that makes a fairly annoying character palatable and easy to relate to.  Her Clementine would be far less easy to like in the hands of a less skilled actress, but Winslet brings a relatable bond to Clem that is not simple for such a harsh character.</p></body></html>

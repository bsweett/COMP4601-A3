The idea behind the re-making of "The Green Hornet" in this smug, part humor part action is nothing new.  Not even for Rogen.  Remember "Pineapple Express"?  Well, this is no "Pineapple Express".  In fact I'm more reminded of the 1960's "Batman" TV series with Adam West.  Yes, I laughed a few times but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with taking comic book heroes and converting them into jokes.  And if you're going to do it, maybe a more anonymous hero(s) would work better.  In fact, how about "Kick-Ass" which is much better?  Anyway, this feature falls into familiar territory.  Short fights with plenty of adversaries, long fights that should have ended with 1 punch (Kato & Hornet) and a ridiculous finale that defies any reality.  The filmmakers obviously had a big budget and damn, I suspect they used every bit of it, but in the end, the film doesn't hold up.</p></body></html>

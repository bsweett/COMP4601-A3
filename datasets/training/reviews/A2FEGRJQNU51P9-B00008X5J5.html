While a bit light on story (evil queen threatens new born princess with curse of death, fairies cause the curse to be limited to slumber, fairies raise princess as a peasant to protect her from curse, curse strikes, etc), Sleeping Beauty tells that story quite well without relying too heavily on over-the-top musical numbers.  Visually, Sleeping Beauty is one of the stronger works of from Disney with a striking Maleficent, contrasts between light and darkness, and one incredibly creepy castle for the evil queen.  Outside of the fairies, the good side is a bit boring, but the three fairies carry the story and breath life into Sleeping Beauty.  Of course, the movie relies on a bit of stupidity on the part of the fairies to actually have a story, but beyond that, the movie works.  This one truly is a classic.<br /><br />This is the two disc "Platinum Edition", however, and there is an abundance of special features.  This set has a commentary track and a trivia track that are each, unfortunately, buried in the bonus features menu on Disc 1.  Rather than having those two features which are designed to play along with the feature be on the main menu, they are each tucked away and easily missed.  The only other features on disc one are a music video from Emily Osment singing the signature song "Once Upon a Dream",<br /><br />The second disc has the bulk of the special features and this is broken into "Cottage" and "Castle".  "Cottage" is designed for the younger viewers with a poorly designed dancing game and a language game so horribly narrated that it is best avoided.  The good stuff (for adults) is in "Castle" with a making of, alternate scenes, a 30 minute video with visuals of the Grand Canyon set to music, the original broadcast of a Disney documentary, and all told, if you're looking for bonus footage, this is the disc to get.<br /><br />On the strength of the art, the fairies, and Maleficent, Sleeping Beauty is a Disney masterpiece.  The Platinum Edition is the DVD to own.</p></body></html>

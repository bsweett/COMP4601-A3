<meta name="summary" content="pretty good film"></head><body><p>this film started off kinda slow for me so the pacing hurt it with me early on&there were some cliche buddy type of things going on that i have seen. once the film got cooking then it was a trip. I dug the music. the backdrop of the film had a retro feel going on.it has alot of funny moments but I wish the film had have jump started a bit more quicker.</p></body></html>

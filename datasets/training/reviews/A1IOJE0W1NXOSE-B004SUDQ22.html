<meta name="summary" content="Excellent movie"></head><body><p>Gwyneth Paltrow plays Catherine, the daughter of a brilliant, but mentally-ill mathematician who has just died.  Jake Gyllenhaal, playing one of her father's students asks permission to look through the books of myriad nonsense which he wrote during his illness, on the off-chance that he might have done some useful work.  He is amazed when he discovers a proof of monumental importance to the mathematical community and his amazement grows when Paltrow claims authorship of the proof.  Things become more complicated for Catherine when her sister arrives from New York and treats her as if she had the same mental illness as her father.  This is a movie with a wonderfully-written script which is brilliantly played by the actors.  It is highly recommended viewing.</p></body></html>

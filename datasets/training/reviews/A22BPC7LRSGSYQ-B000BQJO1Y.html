<meta name="summary" content="Violent, bloody zombie flick"></head><body><p>Dawn Of The Dead (1978) is one of the great zombie movies ever made.  Now I'm talking about the original, of course.  George Romero once again delivers a great zombie movie.  It stars David Emge, Ken Foree, Scott H. Reiniger, Gaylen Ross, and Tom Savini.<br /><br />Basically the movie is about some unknown pandemic that causes flesh-eating zombies to emerge.  This phenomena spreads throughout the U.S.  Four survivors hide in a shopping mall and find themselves fighting the zombies.  The movie is extremely gorey.  Extremely bloody.  It has great special gore effects by special effects guru Tom Savini, who also appears in the movie.  You'll see blood splatter everywhere.  Lots of gunfire.  Lots of violence.<br /><br />The zombies are very basic looking.  The vast majority of them just have their faces painted with grey or blueish-grey makeup.  Since the movie had a budget of only about $650,000 and there were SO MANY zombies, this basic makeup had to do.  Besides that, there was no such thing as CGI back in 1978.  Had there been CGI, the zombies would have looked more realistic, but I'm not a fan of CGI for the most part.<br /><br />This DVD has some good special features.  It's in widescreen format and is remastered in 5.1 DTS & Dolby Digital Surround Sound.  It also has audio commentary from writer and director George Romero, assistant director Chris Romero, special makeup effects artist Tom Savini, and is moderated by Perry Martin.  Also included are the theatrical trailers, TV spots, radio spots, poster and advertising gallery, a bio on George Romero, and a comic book preview.<br /><br />If you like extremely violent zombie movies, then this George Romero classic should entertain you.  It's not a Halloween-ish kind of zombie movie, but it's highly entertaining nevertheless.</p></body></html>

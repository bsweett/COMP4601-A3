In the Lake House they have more chemistry than ever, but surely they could have found better material than this as their vehicle. The Lake Houses is so full of plot holes, so full of cheesy dialogue, and the characters are so underwritten and insipid that the film ends up a weird, flaggingly paced caricature of itself.<br /><br />You really have to suspend disbelief as Alex an architect (Keanu Reeves) and Kate a doctor (Sandra Bullock) actually meet. Both live in a contemporary glass walled house on the picaresque shore of Lake Michigan - he in 2004 and she in 2006 when they begin exchanging correspondence via the house's mailbox. The fact that their letters are traveling through time doesn't seem to bother them.<br /><br />Eventually, they realize that they're meant to be together, but alas what are they to do? They're both stranded in their respective time periods. Alex attempts to seek out Kate's 2004 counterpart when she's tied to a dutiful beau (Dylan Walsh). Mostly, however their liaison relies on split-screen wizardry and fluent editing (by Alejandro Brodersohn and Lynzee Klingman). For her part, Kate waits patiently for Alex to "catch up" to her.<br /><br />Admittedly, The Lake House is beautiful to look at and Sandra and Keanu are absolutely lovely, the spark that ignited between them in Speed still burns, but there's not much edge to their relationship - it's all rather sweet and adorable rather than sexy or passionate. But the major problem with The Lake House is that there's a plot turn in the first act that most savvy viewers will see coming that ruins any suspense for the rest of the story.<br /><br />As Alex and Kate Bullock and Reeves phone in carefully muted performances, in fact they're so subdued that they seem to drift through the story in a daze, as if they don't really care what happens. Even their few scenes together are extremely soft, slow and shamelessly sentimental. Despite the fluid cinematography, editing and music, these short scenes prevent the film from flowing.<br /><br />There's also several nagging plot points - including a superfluous subplot involving Alex's dying father (Christopher Plummer) - that make it almost impossible to suspend disbelief. And how can the lake house supposedly built with pillars and glass have an enclosed attic?  Never mind; trying to find logic in this film will drive you crazy along with a script that jumps around in time so much that you're never quite sure when you're in 2004 or 2006.<br /><br />On the plus side, Agresti's direction is lyrical and textured; giving the film a warm rhythm that just about makes up for its lack of pacing. The movie also highlights the urban beauty of Chicago, making the best of the city's surrounds. And I guess it's nice, after all this time, to see Reeves and Bullock together again, and even though they ground The Lake House and allowing us to overlook many of its contrivances, I'm still not sure why they chose this kind of movie to star in.

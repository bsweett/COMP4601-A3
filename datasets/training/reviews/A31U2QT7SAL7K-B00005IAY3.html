The actors do there best to work the "family thing" but the scenes are prolonged and drag the story line.  More effective are the ones with Melinda Dillon and the precocious Cary Guffey as a mother and son, respectively, terrorized by nocturnal and unseen visitors.<br /><br />That said, the end when the Earthmen and aliens finally make contact is breathtaking.  Coupled with the special effects and John Williams's magnificent score, CETK is a science fiction classic that still manages to captivate.</p></body></html>

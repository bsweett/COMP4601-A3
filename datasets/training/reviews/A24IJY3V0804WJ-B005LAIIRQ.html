<meta name="summary" content="Survival movie"></head><body><p>Grey is a survival movie about a group of oil riggers who must defend themselves in the wild when their plane goes down. This group of survivors is led by Ottway ( Neeson) who has questioned his own mortality at the beginning of the film. Aside from the elements, the plane goes down during an ice storm the survivors must defend themselves against wolves who slowly start eliminating them. The film is mediocre at best, but stayed with me was the photography and the bleakness of the Alaskan landscape in the middle of  winter. We also learn a lot of wolves.

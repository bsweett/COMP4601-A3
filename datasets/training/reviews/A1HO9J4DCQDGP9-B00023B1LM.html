<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable thriller with some good action scenes"></head><body><p>I enjoyed this.  It was good to see it brought into the 21st century, the 1988 Richard Chamberlain version did follow the book better but Matt Damon was pretty hot as the confused and memory challenged assassin Jason Bourne who wakes up on a ship with two bullet holes in his back and no memory of who he is or how he ended up in the middle of the ocean in a wet suit and a numbered Swiss Bank Account embedded in his hip.<p>Jason soon becomes aware that he is no ordinary man.  He speaks several languages fluently and he can kill silently and efficiently.  All of this adds to his confusion, and we are treated to a mad, frantic dash through the streets of various European Cities as Jason tries to remember who he is and what the word Treadstone means before he ends up on a slab in a morgue...<p>Franka Potente plays the young German woman who helps Jason find out who he is, she is pretty good as his love interest, being both brave and vulnerable in the same breath, you will probably remember her from "Run Lola Run" a quirky little film slightly reminiscent of the concept of "Sliding Doors" but with a sharper more violent edge.<p>"The Bourne Identity" is a fairly fast paced movie that is nothing like the book it is taken from which is a shame because the book is excellent; however this is a good little film in its own right.  Not one that I would have gone to the big screen to see but I do think it is worthy of a DVD and its one I would watch again and again just for the excellent fight scenes and great chases especially the first car chase with a battered mini and some fantastic stunt driving.<p>Enjoyable and very watchable in my opinion.</p></body></html>

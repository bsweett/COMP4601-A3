<meta name="summary" content="Was it really such a good idea to make me watch this?"></head><body><p>Especially considering I fell asleep during the previous film! Falling asleep during that made me totally confused as to whether this was a third Evil Dead film (duh, Bruce Campbell is Ash in all 3!), and considering it had a different name - hey, I'm easily confused. Life isn't easy for me when people throw these things at me.<br /><br /> I'm still differing as to what star to give it. Didn't really like the film at all (watchable, but not re-watchable), so that side of me wants to give it a 2. But then it has Bruce Campbell again, which kinda ups the stakes a bit - especially when he's looking all bruised and battered, you just wanna kiss him ALL better! I'm sucker for guys with cuts and bruises.<br /><br /> The film starts off with a small flashback to Evil Dead II (well, I'm assuming that anyway, since I was asleep), reminding you of what happened, before you get thrown into the thick of things. Ash is armed with a shotgun and a chainsaw arm, which you need to see the previous installment to understand - so this went straight over my head!<br /><br /> I wouldn't say this was a horror film at all, more of a comedy, coming out with some great lines, and some funny moments. Most of the funny moments come from Ash - and the &quot;mini Ash's&quot; had me in fits! The highlight of the whole film is the Mini Ash's - they're hilarious, although he manages to multiply himself by looking in and then smashing a mirror? (I'm probably gonna get picked up on that for being wrong!)<br /><br /> There are some pretty cheesy lines, one of which I was really disappointed actually came out of Ash's mouth. He says to the 'hot chick' &quot;Gimme some sugar baby&quot; - to which I responded with &quot;Gimme a break!&quot; Such a cheesy line. (The kinda line you can imagine a guy practising in front of the mirror on a Friday/Saturday night, and then going out and using it on some poor unsuspecting woman. I know what my response would be if that line was tried on me!) And then he goes on to sleep with Sheila, who goes all gooey and knock-kneed at that line. Considering he was supposed to be transported back in time to what, the 13 or 1400s, they don't seem to realise it just wasn't the done thing back then. The only contraception they had was the word &quot;no&quot;, and she wouldn't have been a virgin on her wedding night (heaven forbid!) after sleeping with dear old Ash. I wasn't keen on that section, cos it wouldn't have been done in the 'good ol' days'.<br /><br /> Apparently there's two different endings to this movie. A good ending, and a very depressing (although predictable) ending. Guess which ending I saw? The depressing one! But it's extremely predictable, especially if you count the drops - and then I still had to double check if I was right with what was gonna happen!<br /><br /> I think after seeing Bubba Ho-Tep (in which Bruce Campbell played an old and overweight Elvis) it was good to see him when he still looked quite good - although Bubba Ho-Tep is a must-see! I'm not sure about the whole Evil Dead movies franchise, they just don't appeal to me, but if you like Jim Carrey, you'll definitely see a lot of him in Bruce Campbell, and plus, he's alright on the eye!</p></body></html>

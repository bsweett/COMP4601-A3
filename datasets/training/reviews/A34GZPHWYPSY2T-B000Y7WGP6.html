<meta name="summary" content="The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia really means 'something else'."></head><body><p>THE KINGDOM (2007) is one of those rare, intriguing war movies that is really a high-octane detective story. Moreover, the significance of this film is its clear message: "Let's get bin Laden." Recall the era this was released, and I'll get to that in a moment. I'm all twisted around: I had been wanting to review this film for nearly four years and didn't do it when I ought to have done.<br /><br />The great Chris Cooper (Grant Sykes, FBI bomb squad forensics specialist), who is the actor's actor yet seems like the reincarnation of Droopy Dog, really anchors this film and works beautifully with the others. The secret to any film is the director creating the good atmosphere for the actors - then the actors follow suit by bonding on film. We all love that and we in turn react well to it. I think the lack of that essence is the reason THE HURT LOCKER was so dreadful and IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH was even moreso.<br /><br />After a terrorist bombing at an American military and housing complex in Saudi Arabia, FBI special agent Ron Fleury (a very competent Jamie Foxx) buys the agency five days to investigate. They think it will lead them to a major terrorist (this is the "bin Laden" character). He gets the time, and with his team in tow (Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman among them) he high-tails it to S.A. The investigation itself is fascinating, but what tugs at the heartstrings is the part of the investigation necessitating interviews with the American families living there.<br /><br />That is the part of the story arc that is telling us, "Let's bring our people home." Again, remember the year: we didn't know when, as or if we were getting out of Iraq or Afghanistan. This film, I think, lit a fire under certain posteriors. It really is that good. The downside is it really seems like an overseas episode of "NCIS" - bad for a feature film, but it isn't bad in itself. "NCIS" is perhaps the greatest TV series ever. What I don't like is the idea of a film copying it so obviously. There's homage and then there's "poetic stealing".<br /><br />This film has the muscle and beef to do it well: the cast is enriched by Richard Jenkins, Danny Huston, Jeremy Piven (who is an underrated sex symbol in my opinion), Kyle Chandler, Tim McGraw, and Kelly AuCoin. Though Huston's appearance seems either gratuitous or pointless, I like seeing him anywhere - just like Richard Jenkins.<br /><br />The technical skill of this film is not to be ignored: it is top-notch. The storyline seems bumpy because it is meant to be a bumpy film. I absolutely hate and reject the jiggly you-are-there hand-held camera crap, yet it is used well in KINGDOM. Like everything, this film lets nothing go to waste.<br /><br />KINGDOM grossed nearly $48 million in its November 2007 release. Hip 'young' director Peter Berg (whose only other big-time films are HANCOCK and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS) really shines here, in dull, Cubist browns and desert tans. Berg creates these great atmospheres for his actors; it is a gift but many other directors could really learn from Berg.<br /><br />I will divulge/spoil no more. Just be aware that if you do not totally love this film, it will be good the first time then seem like an old TV rerun thereafter. I will get it for my video library one of these days, but I recommend caution to the general audience.</p></body></html>

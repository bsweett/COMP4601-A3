I have to admit, I went into ALICE IN WONDERLAND expecting the worst.  I had heard some terrible things from friends who had already seen it, and the trailers didn't give me much hope, either.  But since I frequently believe in six impossible things before breakfast, I decided to try ALICE IN WONDERLAND for myself. And I am so glad that I did.  ALICE IN WONDERLAND is an incredible mash up of Lewis Carroll's two Alice books - "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and "Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There."<br /><br />Let's face it.  Tim Burton is a very odd director, and the original Alice books are quite odd themselves.  Put the two together and you get amazing brilliance.  Remember, Disney's animated Alice in Wonderland is not very true to the source material; rather it is, well, a Disneyfied version of a small part of Lewis Carroll's original works.  Carroll accomplished quite a feat with the Alice books:  he wrote a fanciful story that really appealed to children, and combined it with a strong satire very relevant to the political world of the time.  And perhaps the most astonishing thing of all is that his works continue to be so well known.  Many, many words and phrases from the Alice stories have become part of our lexicon and are still in use, even today.<br /><br />But, back to this film rendition of ALICE IN WONDERLAND.  This ALICE IN WONDERLAND opens with Alice, age 19, about to get engaged.  She doesn't really want to, but it is what is expected of her.  We realized that Alice is an unusual girl:  she has a mind of her own, modern ideas, and she has been plagued by mysterious dreams all her life.  Alice is dreading her engagement (she doesn't even particularly like the young man), when suddenly she is distracted by a rabbit...in a waistcoat, no less!  Of course, she follows him, avoids her own proposal, and falls down a rabbit hole.  Once she lands, a long, long way down, there are many of the expected Alice experiences from the original book, ending with Alice eventually being the right size to enter Wonderland.  Once she is there, people keep asking if she is THE Alice, the REAL Alice, and Alice slowly begins to understand that her dreams...her nightmares...have perhaps, maybe, been memories.  But is she the real Alice?  Is she the champion?  And can she save Wonderland from the Red Queen?<br /><br />Tim Burton works his usual brand of extraordinary magic bringing Wonderland to life.  The sets and effects in ALICE IN WONDERLAND are outstanding - dark, colorful, and wonderfully weird.  The bandersnach, the jubjub bird, and the jabberwock look very similar to the original illustrations and exactly as I have pictured them in my head all these years.  Dee and Dum are definitely Tweedly.  And the beamish vorpal sword does indeed go snicker-snack on the Frabjous day.  The Rev. Dodgson would have been amazed and proud at seeing his imagination brought to life so vividly.  The acting and voice talent are incredible, including the incomparable Johnny Depp as the appropriately mad Hatter, Stephen Fry as the voice of a delicious Cheshire cat, Severus Snape, uh, I mean Alan Rickman as the voice of the hookah-smoking Blue Caterpillar, Mia Wasikowska as a near perfect Alice, Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway as ideal opposite foils portraying the Red and White Queens respectively, Christopher Lee as the terrible Jabberwock, and a veritable host of others.  The cast assembled for ALICE IN WONDERLAND is what makes this film click, and all put in amazing performances.<br /><br />I can certainly see that ALICE IN WONDERLAND is not for everyone.  It is a very odd and strange film, but, in my humble opinion, in a good way.  And in a way that is true to Lewis Carroll's original writings.  If you like the bizarre and unusual, if you think you CAN believe in six impossible things before breakfast, then this ALICE IN WONDERLAND is definitely for you.  My husband and I really loved it, when we had not expected to.  It really surprised us.  And that is what defines ALICE IN WONDERLAND as a truly great film.</p></body></html>

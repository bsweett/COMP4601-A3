<meta name="summary" content="Funny, But Predictable."></head><body><p>I'd imagine that doing a re-make of a movie that many people really liked must be very hard.  First of all, everyone is going to have an immediate bias because you're not being original and also that the original was good and its a hard movie to live up to.  Luckily, Sandler and crew did a pretty good job of keeping the movie entertaining and funny.<br /><br />This movie is about ex-MVP qarterback Paul Crewes (Sandler).  He got kicked out of the NFL for fixing a playoff game.  So he goes on a drinking binge one night and gets arrested for reckless driving and a DUI.  When he goes to prison, he gets immediately harrassed by the guards and is not well liked by his fellow inmates.  Then the warden of the prison offers him to coach a team that would play his team of prison guards.  Obviously the prisoners want to cream the guards so they make a football team.  They practice really hard and play against the guards.  Sounds like something that you've heard before, right?<br /><br />First, I have to say that I'm glad that Adam Sandler's comedy has grown up a little bit.  Now he's targeting late teens to early twenties, rather than the 13-16 range of teens.  This movie is actually pretty funny.  Much of that has to go to Chris Rock's credit.  Theres a cast of wacky characters on both teams, but Chris Rock provides most of the film's jokes.  I guess the thing that bugged me about the film is that it is way too predictable.  You know whats gonna happen at the end and it takes away from the film.<br /><br />So my overall opinion would be to see this film.  Theres so good stuff in the film, and it does keep you entertained pretty much thoughout.  If you're bored one day or are a football/Sandler fan, then check out this film.  Otherwise, this may not be what you're looking for.</p></body></html>

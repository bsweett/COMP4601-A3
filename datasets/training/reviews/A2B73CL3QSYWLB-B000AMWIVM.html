When the film started out it was suspenseful but the inevitable comparisons to "Seven" started to float through my mind.  About the midway point the film kicked into second gear and delivered some twists that are superior to "Seven".  Outside of an above average script for this genre type there is superb direction by James Wan.  Wan really has a sense for establishing mood and paces his film well.  About the only really qualm I have with the film is that the characters aren't really fully developed.  For those who are a little squeamish, the film does contain some intense and grisly scenes but on the whole it doesn't go over the top.</p></body></html>

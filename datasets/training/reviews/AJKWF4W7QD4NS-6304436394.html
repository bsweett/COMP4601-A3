Antonio Banderas returns in the role that made him famous with Desperado, but his character and performance is outshined by the always fantastic Johnny Depp as the mysterious CIA Agent Sands who recruits the Mariachi for his own purposes.  Salma Hayek's role is nothing more than a cameo in the beginning flashback of the film, and the colorful cast also includes Willem Dafoe, Mickey Rourke, Rueben Blades, Danny Trejo, and Eva Mendes; most of whom go greatly underused.  Once Upon a Time in Mexico is nowhere as great as either El Mariachi or Desperado, and the film would probably be a clunker were it not for Rodriguez' well crafted action scenes and Depp's film stealing performance.  All in all, this is worth checking out for fans of Depp or fans of the Mariachi, just don't expect much from it.</p></body></html>

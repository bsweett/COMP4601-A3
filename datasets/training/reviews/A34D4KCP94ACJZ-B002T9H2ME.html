<meta name="summary" content="My Favorite Film of 2009"></head><body><p>The one and only drawback of a truly great movie, like debut director Duncan Jones' Moon, is that it is a film which unravels in a way that makes it difficult to talk about without giving away significant plot points that are better left unsaid for any viewer.  In fact, I'll say now that while I certainly do not plan to give away key details, I still caution potential readers here that the film is likely more effective if you know absolutely nothing about it at all going in.  Duncan Jones is an English filmmaker who is young enough that we can expect many more intelligent and engaging films from him in the near future.  He is also the son of musician David Bowie, of who I am a huge fan.<br /><br />Moon is a film that stars a nearly solitary Sam Rockwell in what is actually more than just another great performance in a nearly immaculate acting career; this is Rockwell's best work and it would be a shame if he was not nominated for the Oscar for best actor.  Rockwell's character is the everyman Sam Bell and he is accompanied throughout the movie by his kindly robot friend voiced by Kevin Spacey.  There was a time when Spacey was the best actor in the business so it's nice to see him at least voice a character in an inspired film like this.  Anyway, all these elements I knew going in and I thought I was going to watch something like 2001: A Space Odyssey meets Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth, based on the great Tevis novel and starring Moon's director's daddy, the one and only thin white duke, as the earthbound alien of course.  For those who have seen Moon, you now know how little I knew going into it.<br /><br />The moon has helium-3, something rare on Earth, and likely quite useful in terms of fuel alternatives.  So Sam Bell, a married man and father, was contracted by a company called Lunar Industries to oversee a very ambitious project to extract this clean fuel alternative from the dark side of the moon.  His contract of three years will end in just two weeks and he will be free to go home and see his wife Tess and his now toddler age daughter Eve.  During his time on the mostly automated lunar base, Sam has only had two forms of communication; one with GERTY, a robot assistant (Spacey), and the other is just regular recorded transmissions from his family and the company he works for.  The satellite that allows live communications to and from Earth has been down indefinitely and Lunar Industries has little interest in making it a priority to fix.  So Sam Bell has been alone for a very long time.  That is only about 10% of the story but I'll stop there.<br /><br />Moon is timeless, even visually the sets are reminiscent of older films, but it is also incredibly authentic and modern. Moon really is a film about humanity in a primal sense that just escapes words, but it is wrapped-up brilliantly in a very sound and believable science fiction setting.  In addition, the cinematography and soundtrack serve to make the whole picture more seamless and cohesive and are among the best efforts within their respective film-making trades of 2009 as well.  However, it is the screenplay that might deserve the most praise of all.  The dialogue is witty and speaks surprisingly to either the thoughtful or angry anarchist, or even just your everyday thinking independent.  These ideas are of course in stark contrast to the elements of this mystical "Lunar Industries" authoritarian entity, as they are in nature, which is once again a timeless theme in both general story-telling from Orwell to Alan Moore, and in both past and contemporary paranoia toward corporatism and big active governments.  This is a smart movie but it is also incredibly engaging even in a more superficial understanding.<br /><br />There were a lot of great movies in 2009 and it's been a while that I can say so early on that I've seen most of them.  District 9 was a great movie for many different reasons and perhaps I'll get into that in another review.  I also loved Star Trek and Drag Me to Hell, but it's this little $5 million dollar space movie that gripped me most of all.  It is a perfect movie and I cannot recommend it enough.</p></body></html>

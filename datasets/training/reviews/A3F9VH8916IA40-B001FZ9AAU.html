Forget the sorry excuses for movies that were Spider Man 3, or The Fantastic Four, forget all that nonsense. Iron Man stands with the best, a true revival for the super hero genera on par with the great super hero movies such as Spider Man 2 and Batman Begins. What a way to kick off the summer season that will also see long awaited films such as the new Indiana Jones movie, the second Batman film The Dark Night, and the redo of The Incredible Hulk.<br /><br />The film starts off with billionaire/genius weapons developer Tony Stark riding in the back of a Humvee in the Afghan desert, havening successfully impressed the military by blowing up a whole mountain with his new Jericho Missile. From the start of this film Tony is one of the MOST likable guys to ever grace the big screen. He's charming, smart, witty, funny, hardcore, and a bit of a ladies man. One memorable scene was when a girl Toney was with woke up in his house alone and found his personal assistance, Pepper Pots, with her dry-cleaning.<br />"Ten years and he still has you doing his dry cleaning?"<br />"I do anything he requires of me," Potts replies, "even, occasionally, taking out the trash."<br />As he eloquently puts it; "They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire, well I respectfully disagree. I prefer the one you only have to fire once. That's how America does it, that's how my dad did it, and it's worked out pretty well so far." Now tell me you wouldn't like to hang out with THAT guy.<br /><br />Unfortunately for our hero the Humvee he's riding comes under fire from Afghan rebels and he is taken hostage and forced to build one of his new weapons for his captures (after refusing of course and getting water boarded). But he has a few tricks up his sleeves and manages to escape by building, you guest it, an Iron Man.<br /><br />Far and away the best thing this movie accomplishes is creating likable characters who may not be as relatable as, say, Peter Parker, but who are definitely just as cool or sympathetic. As stated before, Tony Stark is the very definition of cool, but he isn't the only character who steals the show. His lady friend, oddly named Pepper Potts (okay, who was the genius who decided to name her Pepper Potts?) is perfect in her role as personal assistant/love interest with all her witty dialog and charm. The Afghan man Tony meets while in captivity is also a great contrast to Starks cocky and care free attitude; plus their conversations with one another are some of the best you'll see in a super hero movie, period.<br /><br />The only problem I had, and it's a small one, is that the action in this film was a little lacking. The escape from Afghanistan in the first Iran Man was great, and the battle between Iron Man and the Afghan militia later on was also incredible, but when it came to Iron Man VS really big Iron Man, the outcome was somewhat of a disappointment; the reason being that we never got to see both fighting at their best. One was always at a disadvantage during the whole fight. To see both go at it at their best would have been nothing short of amazing, unfortunately though we never got to see that.<br /><br />If you're a super hero movie fan then you HAVE to see this flick. Iron Man stands proud with the best in its genera and simply blows out of the water most badly made adoptions. Oh, and one more thing, if your willing to wait ten minutes for the credits to finish there is a thirty second scene at the end that may be worth seeing as it sets the stage for a sequel pretty well.<br /><br />Re-watch Value; VERY high.</p></body></html>

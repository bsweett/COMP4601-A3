<meta name="summary" content="Winning and losing on and off the gaming floor"></head><body><p>"Casino" is a crime drama film that is based on true events. Creative license has been used but essentially numerous events are similar to those experienced by Frank "Lefty" Rothstein, referred to in this movie as Sam "Ace" Rothstein.<br /><br />Rothstein (Robert De Niro) is a seasoned gambler with a history as a professional sports bettor. He is put in charge of the Las Vegas casino Tangiers as part of a Mafia effort to build a stake in the market, and to also siphon profits back to its unofficial owners before disclosing a reduced bottom line to tax agencies.<br /><br />The film narrative conveys large scale corruption and violence associated with the gaming industry. It also puts forward that there are few loyalties within the greedy and ruthless community of casino managers and owners.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author</p></body></html>

As the intelligent plot needed to be squeezed into a normal length movie, the story is constantly in a rush. Perhaps some kind of series would have been a better idea..Anyway all other details, like actors and pictures looks well in order. It's almost impossible to accept Tom Hanks as a professor though. Couldn't they find someone else for that part? With the exception of Saving Private Ryan and Road to perdition that guy has been playing nitwits all his life. (SARR)</p></body></html>

The trailer (complete with the operatic score) just made my skin crawl with excitement.  As the Oscar season progressed and I watched this film get repeatedly snubbed I began to worry, but my interest and anticipation did not dwindle.<br /><br />And then I saw the film.<br /><br />`Revolutionary Road' is really a mixed bag of tricks, with a lot going for it, but enough working against it to keep it from becoming the brilliant drama it should have been.  The novel, one of my personal favorites, reeks of humanity and blunt honesty, and while the film carries with it a genuine awkwardness, it's overt obviousness can at times take away from the message Yates was trying to provide us.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Frank and April Wheeler, a young suburban couple living in the 50's who loathe their lives.  They are stuck in a nice house on a nice street littered with nice people.  They have nice kids and Frank works at a nice job and they are basically sick of the existence they've pigeonholed themselves into.  They want to be free, free from the generalities that make their life so loathsome.  The point is that while their life appears to be perfect, it is that perfection that drives them crazy.  It is that perfection (and their growing distain for their lack of spontaneity) that has driven a hole into their marriage and caused them to attack one another, picking at their faults and growing to detest the very sight of one another.<br /><br />Be forewarned; `Revolutionary Road' is one of the bleakest films released in recent memory.<br /><br />In a stroke of desperation, April suggests that Frank quit his job and move the family to Paris, where he would be free to find himself while she supported him and the children doing secretarial work.  Despite the mixed reaction from friends and workmates, Frank seems keen on the idea.<br /><br />But is he?<br /><br />Sam Mendes manages to do a lot of justice to Richard Yates' novel, I cannot fault him there.  His style of direction, from the choice in music to the graceful way he captured the era within the actors, was completely complimentary to the source material.  I was in awe of almost every frame, each one just as beautiful as the next.  That had a lot to do with the costume design as well, and the set pieces are glorious.  I loved the crisp whites and overall brightness of most the scenes; the open rooms within their home splattered with yellows and creams and basically adding to the idea that it is the cheery normality of it all that is the evilest creature.<br /><br />This is a story about loathing complacency.<br /><br />The acting for the most part is stellar.  Kate Winslet slips in very easily here, and while it can be said that she has done this role before I don't think that she has ever done it so well.  She is a pro, there is no denying that.  Leonardo DiCaprio feels slightly awkward in scenes, as if he isn't sure he knows how to get a full handle on his character; but when he is really needed in order to sell a scene (that brutal fight sequence towards the films end for one) he really nails it.  It's a slightly uneven performance, but there is more good than bad here.  I was more impressed with David Harbour, who plays Shep, the Wheeler's neighbor.  I remember when I read the novel I was really drawn to Shep's quiet yearning for April, and his total feeling of loss.  Harbour nails that.  I would have much rather seen him garner an Oscar nomination over Michael Shannon, who did was he was asked to do but nothing more.  Shannon, in his portrayal of the mentally unstable John Givings, plays `crazy' the way crazy is always played.  I really wanted him to layer this character, since it is within this character that the Wheeler's whole world is brought to fruition.<br /><br />He just didn't do that for me.<br /><br />This is where the films primary flaw lies.  Within the Wheeler's dealings with John and his parents (gloriously played by Kathy Bates and Richard Easton) their whole existence, motives and underlying feelings towards each other, is unveiled.  In the novel, while it is almost delivered in the same manner, it appears more subtle and discreet.  No one likes to be browbeat, and so Yates, while maintaining the bluntness with which he treated his characters from the novels beginning, managed to tell us what was `really' going on without `telling' us.  In the film adaptation the same structure is used, but Shannon's delivery of each line feels far too brutish for it to really make an impact.  There is no feeling of mystery or emotional reveal.<br /><br />He yells, they react, we get the picture.<br /><br />Had Shannon toned down his approach and actually `lived' that moment as apposed to `act' it, we would have felt something close to what Yates captures on the printed page.<br /><br />In the end, `Revolutionary Road' is well worth seeing.  The film is harsh, very harsh, and there are no happy endings so don't wait up for them.  This is a film in vein of the novel, truly capturing the harrowing realities of a marriage on the rocks.  This is honest, brutally so, and thus it is not for everyone.  Many people want to escape the realities of life in film, and if that is your intent then stay far away from `Revolutionary Road'.  If, on the other hand, you like to experience film in order to reveal truths about yourself and those around you, then by all means, see this movie.  It will not leave you feeling warm all over.  It will most likely make you squirm in discomfort and break down into tears and leave you in a state of misery (my wife balled her eyes out and lost sleep), but the films honesty is nearly unrivaled.<br /><br />Despite a few flaws it is intelligent, engaging and unforgettable.</p></body></html>

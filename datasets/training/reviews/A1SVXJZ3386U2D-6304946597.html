<meta name="summary" content="Great Scott!"></head><body><p>One of the great movies of the 1970's was "Patton" with an outstanding preformance by George C. Scott.  It was a bit controversial at the time because it was shown to a general public that was seriously divided over the on-going Viet Nam War.  For many, the movie represented a glorification of war while, for others, it represented the power of the individual.  It was a favorite of then-President Nixon (which was another mark against it for some).  What it was for most of us was an excellent historical biography that displayed the best that Hollywood had to offer.<br /><br />There was a lot of technical achievement in the film and it won Oscars for Art/Set Direction, Sound, and Editing while losing out to "Tora! Tora! Tora!" in the category of Special Visual Effects.  However, the most noteworthy aspect of the film was George C. Scott's title role performance.  He vividly portrays a determined, emotional, passionate man whose quick tongue and temper got him as much time in the dog house as in the spot light.  The movie portrays the dilemna of a brilliant general leading a citizen army.  No problem with the troops but they all had families and congressmen who seemed to have better ideas on how to do things.  Patton, the ultimate warrior, died shortly after WWII.  His portrayal in this movie makes one wonder if that wasn't for the best; who could imagine a peacetime Patton after what he had experienced?<br /><br />"Patton" won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Direction (a relatively obscure Franklin Schaffner), Best Writing (Francis Ford Coppola) and, as no surprize, Best Actor.  George C. Scott actually declined the award although without all the hoopola of Marlon Brando.  Karl Malden gives an excellent preformance in his supporting role as General Omar Bradley.<br /><br />I hadn't seen this movie in many years until just recently.  Frankly, something about it seemed to have lost a bit of its' luster.  However, I watched it so many times back then that I could practically say the lines along with Scott.  More likely it was because the political and military climate had changed quite a bit in the intervening years.  Oddly, maybe this was a movie that was released at just the right time.</p></body></html>

The first sequel,' The Spy Who Shagged Me', was bad enough but this really stretches the franchise way too far and over the top. <p>I would have thought that the writers would have come up with some new material but no, its still the same 'Yeeeah Baby' and 'Very Shagadelic' one liners which bring down this films' credibility even more. It's only saving grace are the vast amount of cameos near the beginning, from then on; its trash. The overused 'mole' joke really gets on your nerves after a while and is just another blatant lack of fresh ideas for this third instalment. Even the appearance of Destiny's Child beauty Beyonce Knowles isn't enough to keep you interested. For real comedy, just stick to the first film.</p></body></html>

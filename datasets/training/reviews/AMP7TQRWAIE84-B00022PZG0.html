<meta name="summary" content="One of the better movies I've seen in recent times."></head><body><p>When this was out in 2003 for some reason I wasn't psyched to see it at all. However, now that I've sat down and watched as much of the movie as I could (while taking bathroom breaks and such) I must say it was hella worth it! School Of Rock is a funny, relatable and heartwarming film about big dreams, taking chances and having fun. Jack Black is your typical "loser" who is in a band that is going nowhere financially. Everyone tells him that he should take life more seriously and get a real job. So he does--as his friend! He applies for a job at a private prep school for young kids and instead of teaching them the basic subjects most schools teach he engulfs them in a pure rock music frenzy! He unleashes the inner Freddie Mercury and Tina Turner in all of the boys and girls in the classroom.<br /><br />Throughtout the movie he gives each of them roles in the band and some of the members even learn self-confidence and to get along better with their fellow classmates. It really is a great movie and one that I would hate to see negative reviews about simply because I thought it was an awesome guilty pleasure.<br /><br />Enjoyable to the brim.<br /><br />4.4 stars.</p></body></html>

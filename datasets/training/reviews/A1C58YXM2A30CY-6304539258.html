<meta name="summary" content="Lucas Masterpiece Star Adventure!"></head><body><p>George Lucas' space adventure that revolutionized science fiction film-making.<br /><br />Truly a film masterpiece.  It takes a standard tale of love and war, patriotism and honor and creates something special.  Truly a sum of its parts!<br /><br />Words scan across the screen at the start, similar to the old Buck Rogers and other serials of the mid-twentieth century.  And like those films, it takes place in a universe of extraordinary technology.  But not of the future!  Of the past!  Sure, why not?  Why would there not be galaxies that are so old as to predate our own civilization, so far, far away?<br /><br />The princess of the piece, at risk of her life, sends a secret message through her droid (little robot guy, used in manufacturing and pilot control) and send them off to a desert planet, orbiting a twin star system.  In many ways, reminded me of Frank Herbert's Dune.  In fact, there is a skeleton of a Sandworm!  Coincidence?<br /><br />I won't go over the whole plot here.  If you have not yet seen Star Wars, please do.  Luke Skywalker, oblivious to his past heritage, is just a farm boy who desires someday to be a soldier, a freedom-fighter.  But alas, he will most likely be like his Uncle Owen, living on a backward planet, doing some hydroponics and maybe even play in the  Mos Isely band.  Did they ever do kareoke?<br /><br />The death of his aunt and uncle at the hands of the Empire, with the blackened corpses of his aunt and uncle (quite horrific for a PG film, actually) fires up Luke.  He desires revenge.<br /><br />So we have the plot thicken:  A force of evil, a backward boy with dreams, galavnized by the death of his only family but no place to put forward his intentions of revenge.  He meets Obi-Wan and thinks the princess is hot.  Ah, if he only knew.<br /><br />And the story goes.  George Lucas, director of such hits up to that time of the powerful THX-1138 and the hilarious American Graffiti, turned out what was in fact the turning point in science fiction cinema, just by taking a fun popcorn plot with a simple yet powerful story and creating a revolution.<br /><br />I have read other stories of corrupt empires both past and present and of the lives of men and women who fought, avenged and struck back in the name of freedom.  The Roman Empire (it's rise and fall) and Isaac Asimov's Harry Seldon in The Foundation Trilogy come to mind, and even to some extent Frank Herbert's Dune series.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

I think this is more due to its curious handling of the entire alien plotline which cheerfully combines the usual, 'alien chases humans who then chase it,' fare with a startling mystical vision.  There is a great deal of symbol dropping, but the references to biblical myth never quite gel.  Director David Finchley never quite overcomes the hurdles that this aspect of the film presents, but he actually does quite well with everything else, so the film really deserves a second chance.<br /><br />Stanza three of this tale finds us momentarily aboard Ripley's escape vessel, just long enough to become aware that there is an alien with them and to see the ship crash on yet another grim, unpleasant planet.  Ripley is the only survivor and finds that here rescuers are the remnants of a prison colony.  When this colony of double y chromosome criminals was closed several years before, a small group that had found some comfort chose to remain along with a two warders and the prison doctor.  A rescue ship is due for her 'sometime' but the prison's unrelieved post-modern gothic setting is poor comfort to Ripley in the meanwhile.<br /><br />This film makes no effort to hide the awful truth.  Even as Ripley cremates her fellow escapees, we get to watch the birth of yet another of mankind's nemeses in the endless bowels of the prison.  Once again, a hungry alien starts treating humans as snacks.  Ripley attempts to alert the wardens but all is useless.  Her only friends are Clemens (Charles Dance), the prison medic, and Dillon (Charles S. Dutton), the prisoner who doubles as one of the strangest religious leaders in interstellar space.  It isn't until it is clear that something awful is stalking the inmates that the cast settles down to fighting, running, and being munched.<br /><br />The story has quite a few twists as Ripley gradually realizes that the Alien is hardly the worst of her problems.  There are many opportunities for strong character acting and the cast makes the most of almost all of them.  Even the alien has it's moments.  With countless tunnels and dark corners the film has all the room it needs for plenty of action and the bloodthirsty won't feel the least bit disappointed.<br /><br />As I've already said Finchley has cast our hungry xenomorph as the Beast of the Apocalypse.  I can't say as how I blame him (the aliens do represent the end of life as humans think of it), but the imagery is so overstated that many viewers will be put off.  For one, I liked both the filmic and musical moments that were so redolent of monastic appearances.  But, while they added atmospheric depth, they never really advanced the plot, which focused more on the countless acts of heroism that made up the prisoner's defensive efforts.  For being society's dregs, they will quickly win your sympathy.</p></body></html>

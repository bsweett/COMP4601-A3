The film does succeed on the whole.  But...<p>The plot is what tripped me up the most here.  What could have been a more profound statement on free-will and future-control turns out to be a less-than-satisfying murder mystery.  &quot;Is that all,&quot; I asked as the mystery was revealed.  I found the revelation and the &quot;point&quot; of the film anticlimactic.<p>Also -- one major continuity flaw.  If the agency was on the look-out for Anderton, how in the world could he get in to their facility TWICE without being noticed?  He used his own eyes to get past security.  Don't you think that someone in the agency -- a computer at the least, would have alerted them that he was in the building?  It almost seemed silly at this point.</p></body></html>

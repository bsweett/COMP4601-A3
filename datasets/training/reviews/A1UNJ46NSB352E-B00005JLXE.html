<meta name="summary" content="Solid DVD"></head><body><p>Daredevil, as a movie, is a solid comic book movie.  I have no idea how it relates to the comic books, but this movie is solid.  Ben Affleck give a better-than-expected performance as Murdock/Daredevil, and Jennifer Garner does a solid job as well.  There are a few plot holes, but the movie is worthwhile.<p>On the technical aspect, DVD's don't get much better than this.  The picture quality is perfect and the Dolby Digital 5.1 track is outstanding.  Definitely a good one to show off.  There are also plenty of extras on the DVD to watch.  Pick up this DVD if you are a fan of superhero movies.</p></body></html>

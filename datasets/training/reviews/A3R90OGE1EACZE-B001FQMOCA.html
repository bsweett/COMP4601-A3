When I left I was a reluctant fan.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix and Reece Witherspoon did a phenomenal job as the two lovebirds and I thought that they both did a great job singing in the movie as well considering neither of them had sung professionally before.<br /><br />At times the movie could be sad, sometimes a little boring, but the two actors made me believe that they really were John and June Carter Cash. The rest of the supporting characters were also very good and made this movie very nice to watch</p></body></html>

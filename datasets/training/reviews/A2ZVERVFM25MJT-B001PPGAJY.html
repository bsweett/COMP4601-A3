<meta name="summary" content="Improves on the first movie"></head><body><p>There's no question that bigger, bolder, better, faster applies to the X-Men sequel, with a whole array of new characters, more stunts, an obviously bigger budget and a returning cast.  This time round the X-Men must club together to defeat mutant-hating Synger (Cox), who is attempting to trick Professor X (Stewart) into destroying all the world's mutants using his telepathic powers.  Alongside Jackman's hulking Wolverine, there are some great new characters, most notably Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler.  A seemingly bizarre casting choice, he works surprisingly well as a German teleporting mutant paired up with Halle Berry's Storm.  Of the kids at the training academy, Iceman's powers are displayed with a light touch, along with his look-but-don't-touch relationship with Paquin's Rogue.  Pyro doesn't really get much screentime but, without giving away too much plot, there's a distinct feeling there'll be more of him in X-Men 3.<p>The acting, as a whole, is good.  In particular, James Marsden isn't nearly as irritating this time round, and actually gets a chance to act in the final scenes.  Famke Janssen proves that she can be quite a presence, and McKellen gives it his all.  But there's no doubt that this Jackman's movie, and he gives it his all to come across as the dark mysterious type.  This fits in seamlessly with the references to his murky past and the fact that his mean streak is shown in full this time round.<p>As for the film itself, it's edge-of-your-seat stuff, so the exposition-packed first installment really pays off.  The fight scenes are more impressive, particularly between Wolverine and his female equivalent, an energetic Kelly Hu.  There are also plenty of exciting stunts and the scene where the military break into the academy is very well staged indeed.  Even the obligatory 'human' element of the storyline is anything but cheesy, and mostly quite subtle.  Witness Storm and Nightcrawler, Rogue and Iceman and, in particular, Wolverine and Jean Grey.  Of course, all of this is nothing compared to the ending, which should ensure big box office openings when X-Men 3 is released.</p></body></html>

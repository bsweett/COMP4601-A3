It has an unusual twist to it and if you can sit back, relax and not analyze it too much you will enjoy it. It's a little slow in the beginning and the main character is a bit annoying but, it was still a good movie.<br /><br />The special effects were pretty good - 4 out of 5<br />The plot was great - 4 out of 5<br />The Ending was great - 4 out of 5<br />The Acting/Cast was good - 3 out of 5<br /><br />Worth the rental.</p></body></html>

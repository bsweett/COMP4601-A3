The watchability factor is brought along nicely by the agreeable performances of Matthew McConaughey, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Zooey Deschanel. Even ex-football jock and good ol' boy Terry Bradshaw doesn't embarass himself acting-wise (his nude scenes, on the other hand - aaargh!). The plot itself is pretty ludicrous: that of a female professional interventionist being hired by the parents of a live-in 35-year-old man to have a relationship with their son, give him self-esteem, and thus motivate him to move out. Apparently, the son is suffering thru what is called the "failure to launch" syndrome.<br /><br />This movie even does something which romantic movies hardly ever do, which is delve deeper than usual into the male lead's relationship with his buddies. It seemed like half the film was spent with scenes of Tripp (Matthew McConaughey) hanging out with his two best dudes in some form of rigorous sport activity. Of course, these buddy-bonding moments didn't get too serious or emotional, but there was some sincere acting stuff there. To me, however, the real standout is Zooey Deschanel, who plays Sarah Jessica Parker's dour but hot roommate Kit. She owned every scene that she was in. Girl's got charisma.<br /><br />But there's something missing here. For example, the sequences with the various attacking animals were droll enough (and the funniest scene in the movie involved the resuscitating of a mockingbird), but they went overboard with them. That nano-second shot of a chortling post-bite lizard compromised the film's tone for me, as that scene devolved the movie from initially a romantic, lighthearted romp into just outright farcical silliness. Also, the ridiculous climax was poorly thought out and then done by the numbers. Surely, the writer could've thought of a better 15-minute ending to resolve things.<br /><br />As for the two leads, I haven't seen the vibrant S. J. Parker in years and she looks marvelous here and puts in a nice effort as Paula, the professional parents-son separator. It's also nice to see McConaughey in a light-hearted gig and he carries off the role of the stay-at-home son with easy southern charm and panache. The two leads certainly provide some good chemistry. But, maybe, just maybe, the producers should've gotten someone not as good looking, someone not "Sexiest Man Alive 2005" material. Given the true circumstances of why Tripp chooses to stay at his parents' home (divulged around three-quarters of the way thru), it was still pretty implausible for me to buy into - as well, as hard to relate with - this breezy, handsome fella with a great job seemingly needing professional intervention - especially when contrasted with another one of Paula's "work," the chubby and more believable Pat Oswald.<br /><br />I guess I'm giving this one a marginal blessing. Two and a half stars, because the cast was winsome and earnest enough. Again, I couldn't get enough of Zooey Deschanel. It's not their fault that they got torpedoed by an underwhelming story, which fizzles out at the end. FAILURE TO LAUNCH is definitely worth your time and money - as a rental.</p></body></html>

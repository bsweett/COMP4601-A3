And Sean Penn has this masculine arrogance that somehow holds her attention long enough for her to forget about her pressing problems concerning Africa.  I saw this film again last night on cable TV and it was much more confusing the second time around.  Probably should invest in the DVD so I could access the deleted scenes which (maybe) explain everything.  There must be deleted scenes like crazy involving Catherine Keener talking to her agent and listening to the agent explain why she really needed to be in this movie, for they might as well have hired Nicole Richie so little acting ability was needed for her brief scenes with Penn.  Keener's mumbling, thin lipped accent made Nicole Kidman sound almost human.<br /><br />Director Sydney Pollack must have felt bells clicking in his head when he glimpsed Nicole Kidman and heard a tape of the various accents she has essayed on screen.  Not since Meryl Streep has anyone done so many so promiscously, and it is said that Pollack forcefed Kidman hours worth of tapes of Meryl Streep doing the famous "I had a farm in Africa" opening to OUT OF AFRICA, of which I now consider THE INTERPRETER an unoffical remake.  The implication is that Kidman, and her doomed family the Broomes, are the real inheritors of Africa, and that the black revolutions and counterrevolutions that have destroyed the Broomes are hopelessly evil and subhuman.  Why, Nicole, why?  Maybe you wanted to show you weren't afraid of big issues, but why play an African saint when so many talented black actresses were out there just longing for a big meaty part opposite Sean Penn--and many of them much more able to adopt a whispery Danish slash Dutch accent than you (not to mention playing the flute).  Do the DVD scenes tell us why the screenwriters decided to have her play the flute anyhow?  Was it just to get her back into the building after hours?<br /><br />Couldn't she have just forgotten her Metro Card or her purse or something?  No, no, it had to be musical--tragically musical.  John Garfield spent four months at Juilliard learning to play the piano for HUMORESQUE (1946), but Nicole Kidman learned the flute in under forty-five minutes on the set of MOULIN ROUGE.  Ah, the pace of modern filmmaking!  No wonder she seems to make even more movies than the stars of the Golden Age Hollywood cinema.</p></body></html>

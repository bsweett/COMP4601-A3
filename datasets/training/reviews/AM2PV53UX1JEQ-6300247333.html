The clever casting of Mia Farrow notwithstanding, this remake has the same expensive sleek look as the original, and is almost word for word the same screenplay.  What it lacks is the gravity and terror of the original; it's so much the same that it is ultimately pointless.  And even though Gregory Peck and Lee Remick were too old in the original, their stature made the whole movie feel much more important than it had any right to be.  This exercise is more like the recent re-do of PSYCHO - glossy, interesting in paper, but hollow.  And definitely not scary.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="GOOD LOOKING -- GREAT ACTION (BUT NOT ORIGINAL)"></head><body><p>If you passed on THE ISLAND (DreamWorks) because of the misleading title, strange trailers and obtuse poster, some bad reviews, well, you missed a great-looking, high-energy thriller that's essentially an uncredited remake of 1979's CLONUS (Mondo Macabre).<br /><br />Set in a near and believable future, it's about the ultimate insurance policy wedded with cutting edge science.<br /><br />To say more would be unfair. For a surprisingly satisfying, edge of your seat experience about identity and mortality check out this overlooked flick.</p></body></html>

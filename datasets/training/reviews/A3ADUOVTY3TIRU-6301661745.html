<meta name="summary" content="Top Movie"></head><body><p>It starts off with a spacecraft wrecked and Bret(James Fransiscus) is the only survivor.He ends up finding Nova(Linda Harrrison), but Taylor had mysteriously disappeared.Then he also has a bad time of it in Ape city before escaping and this part of the movie is exciting as there is a chase.<br />Then they end up in an underground city,this part is really interesting as he finds remnants of his hometown.I like to look at the scenes here as it appeared that a volcano erupted or something covering up everything and leaving tunnels in certain parts. Then he meets the mutants but it appeared no matter what he said he was doomed with them.This is the one thing which these Planet Of The Apes movies had in common,nothing but doom and gloom. Then Bret finds Taylor and you really hope that the two of them can escape or something,because i think the movie need a happy ending.But that is not what we got.In fact they all died.Which spoilt the entire movie.<br />I mean all the trouble Bret went through to find Taylor and a brief bit of joy before,managing to escape the cage,and then they all got shot in my opinion was a very bad ending.<br />Being that said it still is quite a good movie,and exciting,but sometimes i flick through certain parts i like and don't bother with the ending.</p></body></html>

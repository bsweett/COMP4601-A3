<meta name="summary" content="A good idea that's poorly executed"></head><body><p>At the end of WW2, Hitler attempts to open the gateway to Hell in order to bring back a weapon that will allow him to win the war. He is stopped by the Allies, but while the gate is open, a baby demon, Hellboy (Ron Perlman), comes through. 60 years later, Hellboy, who has been raised by the Allies and is now fighting on the side of good, must go up against the people who brought him to earth in the first place and stop them from bringing about the Apocalypse.<br /><br />"Hellboy" is a really great idea for a film that is let down by its poor execution. The idea of a demon fighting for good has so much potential, as does the idea of him having a pyrokinetic girlfriend (played by Selma Blair), and as with all Guillermo del Toro films, this one is also visually stunning, but once I got over the initial "wow" factor of the special effects, I soon realized that the plot is pretty thin, the characters are boring and the good ideas are underdeveloped (I thought it was criminal that Liz, the pyrokinetic girl, should really only use her powers about once in the whole film). The ending is also a major let-down. It just isn't big enough for what went before it and my father, who saw the film with me, actually said "that's it?!" when the credits started to roll.<br /><br />Although I haven't seen it yet, I have heard that "Hellboy 2" is an improvement on this film, which doesn't surprise me, considering the fact that, after a film this disappointing, the only way to go is up.</p></body></html>

Judi Dench's talent is evident right off....she plays an elderly woman so well that at first I didn't recognize her. The happy ending is MUCH better than the disappointing finish of the novel, with everyone at peace (even the disapproving priest) and the chocolate shop still open in the quaint village. Highly recommend this for a romantic night in this Lent.</p></body></html>

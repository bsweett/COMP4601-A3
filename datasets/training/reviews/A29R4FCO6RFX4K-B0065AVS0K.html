<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic comic book movie"></head><body><p>Of all the comic-book movies that have been made, from Flash Gordon to The Fantastic Four in 2005, this is liable to score a premier spot in the `fan satisfaction' division. No niggling here along the lines of "Spider-Man shouldn't have organic web-shooters" or "Batman's parents shouldn't be shot by the Joker". This collaboration between two one-man bands, comic-book writer-artist Frank Miller and director-writer producer Robert Rodriguez, is as authentic to the source material as those cheapo '60s Marvel cartoons that panned over panels from the caricatures while narrative artists read out the word balloons.<br /><br />Like most flourishing comics, Sin City created a decipherable concrete-but-unreal humanity. Miller mixed a stew of thugs in trench coats out of Chandler or Spillane, a spice of the `bad girl art' that made paperback covers of the 1950s stand out from newsracks and a splatter of the manga-ish stylized goriness which encouraged movies buffs like Quentin Tarantino (who guest-directs one scene) have only recently discovered. The movie candidly matches the look of the comic: stark black-and-white images, with the occasional shocking or beautiful splash of rich color. Most modern noirs incline to the blacker side of monochrome, but Miller's scratchboard techniques, custom-made superbly by Rodriguez, often get the most impact out of white - the blank round reflections of a killer's sunglasses, crosses of sticking-plaster on a much-wounded face, arterial gushes of opaque blood.<br /><br />The movie script also matches the original stories virtually word for word. The original mini-series was about Marv (perfectly incarnated here by comeback kid Mickey Rourke) a relentless but sympathetic freak who avenges the murder of his love by taking on a grisly cannibal (a blank-faced, far-from-Frodo Elijah Wood). The film adapts this (later retitled The Hard Goodbye) and two of its follow-ups including The Big Fat Kill, seemingly blas&eacute; about the similarities among the plots and characters, convinced that the seductive imagery and picturesque citizens would grasp the attention.<br /><br />Be warned, though - this is not a movie for the faint of heart. The extreme violence does get a bit obtrusive, but you can say the same for Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO and others. But to point out its graphic nature is a moot point. It is classic cinema that should be seen and appreciated for what it is-pure entertainment.</p></body></html>

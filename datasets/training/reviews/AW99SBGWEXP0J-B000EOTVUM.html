<meta name="summary" content="Wolf Creek"></head><body><p>Liz (Magrath), Kristy (Morassi), and Ben (Phillips) are travelling across the Australian outback, on their way to the east coast.  Along the way, they stop and do some sightseeing at a crater in Wolf Creek.  When they return to their car, it will not start.  They are in the middle of nowhere, with no one around for miles.  Fortunately for them, one night Mick (Jarratt), a local, comes across them and offers to fix their car and take them back to his place for the night.  Unfortunately, Mick has other plans for the three of them as well.<br /><br />"Wolf Creek" is a genuinely creepy movie.  The kids' aloneness is very evident and eerie, and it is easy to believe that this could really happen.  (Indeed, the movie is inspired by true events).  Jarratt is about as disturbing as you could want in a killer in this type of movie.  "Wolf Creek" was a surprise for me, as I enjoyed it more than I anticipated (if "enjoy" is actually the correct word to use for a movie of this type).  I recommend this for horror fans only.</p></body></html>

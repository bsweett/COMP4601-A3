<meta name="summary" content="Underrated...Pretty Good Romantic-Comedy"></head><body><p>"The Break Up" shot to #1 at the Box Office for a couple weeks, got pretty good reviews, but wasn't well received with audiences. Many people say they didn't like it because all the main characters do is argue and they didn't like the ending. Basically, the reason people don't like this film is because they were expecting a romantic-comedy in the vein of "Failure to Launch" or "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days." Where the storyline is the same and the ending is the same. The Break Up lead people to believe via previews that this would be a comedy like that, instead...It is completely free of those cliches and is instead, kind of original. Even though some of the story elements (like the ending) reminded me of Annie Hall. Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaugn play Brooke and Gary, a couple who co-own a condo and have successful jobs. Problem is, after a couple years together, Brooke finds Gary lazy and Gary finds Brooke pushy. One night, the two decide to break up. The problem is neither one of them wants to give up the condo. So they begin to antagonize one another until someone gives it up. Brooke has Gary kicked off their bowling team, Gary has a strip-poker party, Brooke gets a "Telly Savalas" and dates, Gary plays video games...Sometimes, they kind of just act like children. The movie isn't perfect; In fact, the movies I mentioned above that this film shouldn't be compared to might be better movies. If you watch this film with an open mind and no preconceived ideas of what you're going to see, you may find yourself enjoying it. Aniston and Vaughn are great as the feuding couple and Joey Lauren Adams and Jon Favreau add some great comedic bits here as well. The Bonus Features include an alternate ending, which is a perfect example of why alternate endings suck.<br /><br />GRADE: B-</p></body></html>

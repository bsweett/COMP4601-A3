<meta name="summary" content="So who really ratted out Frank Castle?  Find out in the Extended Cut!"></head><body><p>Well, as you may have read elsewhere here in these reviews, this Extended Cut adds back in a subplot that was totally absent from the Theatrical Cut.  Starting with the newly filmed (yes, newly filmed) animated intro that has Frank and his buddy Weeks back in Kuwait City in '91 being ambushed by Iraqi Nationalist terrorists.  The animated sequence was actually, well I guess "shot" against greenscreen.  The actors acted their parts (in full costume dress) while a still photographer took shots of them, and then uploaded the pics into a computer to convert them to  black and white images using software.  Like a previous reviewer said, it's ashame that this sequence wasn't shot for real.  However I can see why it wasn't as it'd would've taken quite a bit of budget to build the set for just 4 or 5 minutes worth of footage.  Of course, going on location could have cheapened it, but who knows...<br /><br />Anyway, on to the real film.  Well, as it turns out that his buddy Weeks apparently falls into some major gambling debt from Saint's Cuban buddy's Casino.  And to prevent Saint and his gang from killing Weeks, Weeks gives up Frank's identity from the arms deal gone bad that killed one of Saint's sons.<br /><br />So then, the restored footage deals with this subplot of Weeks and Frank and how Frank discovers that Weeks was the mole and how he deals with him in the end.  Does this extra footage make the movie any better?  Well, that's subjective.  I thought it did, because it helps explain some of the turmoil behind Frank's rebirth as the Punisher.  It's not on the level of the Daredevil Director's Cut as someone else mentioned, but it does add a bit of drama to the over-all story.<br /><br />For those wishing for more Punisher-style take-downs, you're not gonna get it here with this Extended Cut.  But if you're a completist and a Punisher fan, pick this up for this relatively low price.  Amazon doesn't have the lowest price, so shop around.<br /><br />All I can say is that I hope that Punisher 2 fulfills some of what was lacking with this original film.  I hear that the setting is gonna move to New York City from Miami for the sequel, so that should sit a little better with some fans.</p></body></html>

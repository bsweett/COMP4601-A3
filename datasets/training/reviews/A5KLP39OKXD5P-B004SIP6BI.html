<meta name="summary" content="A film you will never forget!"></head><body><p>Delightfull, seductive, humorous, and bold would be the four main words to describe this film. A wonderfull story with great performences and wonderfull musical score by Rachael Potter. Juliette Binoche was terrefic, she was very adorable and so was Victoire Thivisol who played her daughter. Carrie-Anne Moss and Alfred Molina delivers a good performence as well and Judi Dench, she is brilliant as always. The film throws light on the simple pleasures of life, the life in towns in France. A film worth watching!</p></body></html>

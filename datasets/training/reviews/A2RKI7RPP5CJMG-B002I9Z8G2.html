In this first solo outing for the TNG crew, Picard and the gang find themselves facing off against the highly popular villains called the Borg.  Having been defeated every time they've battled the Enterprise, the Borg devise a plan to travel back in time to stop a key event in Earth's history and then (big shocker) assimilate everybody.  In a heated and action-packed space battle, the Borg jump through time with the Enterprise E hot on their tale.  The Borg cube is destroyed almost immediately, but this is only the beginning of a fast-paced and highly enjoyable action/dramatic yarn that goes so far as to question a particular crewmember's sanity.<br /><br />While he isn't at the helm of the Enterprise in this film, Jonathan Frakes does call the shots behind the camera.  He takes the screenplay crafted by Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore and blends just enough action into the script to keep the story moving at a good clip.  As much as I enjoy TNG, I do have to say that the series was often weighed down by long and drawn out moments of dialogue.  Frakes puts the brakes on these sequences at just the right time.<br /><br />Patrick Stewart delivers a solid performance as Picard.  Matching him scene-for-scene is Alfre Woodard in an excellent performance as a fish-out-of-water aboard the Enterprise.  James Cromwell proves once again that he deserves bigger roles than the ones he usually gets.  Brent Spiner is sufficient as always as Data and the rest of the crew do an excellent job as well.<br /><br />The music and special effects are also very good.  As stated before, the space battle sequence is amazing.  There's also some zero-gravity action as well.<br /><br />This two-disc set is an excellent addition to any Trek fan's collection (or, in this case, collective).  The special features are a nice treat, and I personally enjoyed the audio commentary from Frakes.  I highly recommend this action-packed space yarn to Trek fans as well as fans of excellent science fiction.</p></body></html>

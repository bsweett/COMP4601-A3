<meta name="summary" content="But this part, the Death part, you do on your own"></head><body><p>The first thing I would like to recommend about Mystic River is that you watch it twice before coming to any conclusions.  Not that it will change the mystery, but so you can fully appreciate what the actors and filmmakers achieved with this movie.<br /><br />It an old plot line of tragedy occurring in the bloom of youth that affects the lives of a group of friends later in life, but Mystic River goes far deeper than most of the stories that follow this path.  I haven't been this overwhelmed by this particularly downtrodden plot since Lorenzo Carcaterra's "Sleepers" (the book, NOT the movie).<br /><br />Jimmy, Dave, and Sean (played by Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon respectively) were childhood friends growing up in a "working man" neighborhood, when a cop stops to confront them about carving their names into fresh cement on the sidewalk.<br /><br />The "cops" take Dave away, but they weren't cops; they were child molesters.  Dave is held captive by these monsters for four days, until he manages to escape.<br /><br />The movie then skips to present time, roughly thirty years later, and picks up on the lives of the boys.  Dave is married, marginally employed, with a young son of his own and dark memories of his past.  Sean is a detective, with an absent wife that telephones him at odd hours and says nothing.  Jimmy is married, three daughters, and owns a corner store.  Jimmy also has a criminal past, and an active relationship with the Savage Boys, neighborhood tough guys.<br /><br />Jimmy's nineteen year old daughter, Katie, is brutally murdered, and while Sean heads the investigation of her death, Dave retracts more into his own world, hiding a dark secret.<br /><br />Is Mystic River a riveting movie?  No.  Is Mystic River the kind of mystery that has you on the edge of your seat?  No.<br /><br />Although there is a pleasant twist in the ending, there are no surprises and no biting of fingernails.<br /><br />What you will feel is that tingle of dread creeping along your spine, a vague horror constructed of real life tragedy, a shivering echo of "what if", all portrayed superbly by this stellar cast.  Tim Robbins is always great, but his portrayal of Dave's tortured mind is provocative and stunningly realistic; this may be Robbin's greatest performance to date.<br /><br />And I never expected Sean Penn to develop into such an exceptional actor, Mystic River really is his finest hour on screen.<br /><br />So yes, the movie unfolds at a slow pace, but at no point did I find myself bored or loosing interest in the storyline.  The acting was inspired, the storyline is a fresh twist on a used plot, the mystery enough of an unknown to keep the pace, the dialogue believable, and the horror kept well hidden in the shadowy corners of your own imagination.<br /><br />Over all, I highly recommend this movie.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

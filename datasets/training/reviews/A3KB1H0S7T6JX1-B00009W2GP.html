The "mother of all battles" awaits and this time it all comes to an end...<br /><br />Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Lawrence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt one that can be watched over and over again.<br /><br />The plot, the setting, the SPECIAL EFFECTS, the music, and the battle scenes are all EXCELLENT!  The Matrix Revolutions is guaranteed to provide for an evening's entertainment.  In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.<br /><br />In conclusion, the Matrix Trilogy, as a whole, is one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!</p></body></html>

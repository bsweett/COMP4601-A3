<meta name="summary" content="How does an author of pulp cowboy novels wrangel an invited lecture to the Viennese Literary Society?"></head><body><p>Joseph Cotton is wonderful as Holly Martins, an out of work writer of pulp cowboy novels who finds out from an old friend about a job that has opened up for him in 1948 Vienna Austria.  The intoxicating atmosphere of this film noir gem owes much to the musical score laid down by zither virtuoso Anton Karas, as well as iconic scenes made possible by Vienna landmarks.  There is also the intrigue of a city partitioned by the Allied powers in the fashion of Berlin--I remember as a student visiting the monument to the Russian liberation!  It seems that the hero's old friend has gotten mixed up in the smuggling of the precious penicillin upon which such many lives depend, and is now suspiciously reported as dead (or is he?).  Holly is soon hot on the trail of the malevolent beings thought to be responsible for these alleged crimes.  His search leads to an encounter with his nemesis, in a car of the Rad (the giant Viennese ferris wheel) perched dangerously high above the city, that is saturated with lethal menace.  Even Holly's surprise invitation to the prestigious Viennese Literary Society (supposedly for the benefit of those intrigued by pulp cowboy fiction) is full of troubling questions.  The final scene as the hero views the girl who has captivated him, as she strolls indifferently by down the lane though the Vienna Woods, is practically a movie into itself.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The biggest little movie of last year"></head><body><p>I can't recall any movie in recent memory that got such a quick audience turnaround then Juno. People seemed genuinely excited that after the bombast of last summer, here comes a film that actually took story and character first and yet now people have completely turned on the film and called it overrated and not funny at all. While there's some nitpicks I can say about the film, the amount of backlash and criticisms laid upon the film seem kind of unfair. This film isn't made to get the discussions going and highlight social issues a la the Iraq War films; it's just simply a family movie, lighthearted in tone and fun to watch.<br /><br />Juno MacGuff is a young 16 year old who discovers that a night with best friend Paulie Bleeker brings the gift of pregnancy, or burden in her case and wants to have an abortion. Changing her mind and having birth go straight to adoption, she finds the perfect parents in Mark and Vanessa Loring but what we want and what we get can be 2 completely different things as Juno learns about life the hard way earlier than most.<br /><br />Juno can be described as a message film with the message actually never being said out loud. Whereas most films are content to have the theme said in dialogue, Juno takes the more smarter approach in showing the responsibilities and changing views that can come with pregnancy and it's not enough to be able to financially handle it, you have to know personally you can. Course many parents become unexpected mothers and fathers and many succeed but Juno doesn't explicitly say out loud the idea of "be prepared to handle the surprises of life" but it still works in the end.<br /><br />First, my one negative and its in the writing. Award-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody writes a very touching, sweet and realistic portrayal of the changes that come with parenthood which I felt were nicely handled but then we get the dialogue. Lines like "honest to blog?" and "Thundercats are go!" to signal the water breaking just seem...strange and you start to ask yourself whether anyone, let alone young teenagers, talk like this. But then other lines work and some of it was actually funny but I can see why people might not find it working for the film.<br /><br />Acting-wise it largely falls on Ellen Page's shoulders who shows the maturity and yet the naivety of someone old enough to know she doesn't know everything. We also get turns from reliable Jason Bateman, J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney as Juno's parents, Jennifer Garn..um, Affleck, and Michael Cera who always brings that deadpan humor though sometimes I feel it's just his Arrested Development character in movie form, but it's still a solid acting ensemble.<br /><br />Even though it looks like a film for everyone, not everyone will get its brand of humor but like the film anyway while others find it completely unfunny but I'd give it a shot anyway though to test the waters, try it with a crowd. Laughter is contagious, you know?</p></body></html>

The film is funny because it reinvents the KGB, the Soviet Union, Stalin and the whole cold war just for fun. It is true that was easy in those days to have an enemy. After all he had the Nazis in one film, so why not the good old Soviet communists. But what is rather surprising is how Spielberg merges some influences in this new film. Amazing how his search is based on riddles, like Harry Potter's adventures. Amazing how E.T. finds his way into Peru and the old Incas, even if they seem to speak Maya. But that's just a Detail of course. But I find this not as creative as we could have expected. To attribute human culture, human civilization to the coming of an extra-terrestrial species of intelligent beings that looked like plain terrestrial human beings, to teach the very primitive human beings how to grow potatoes or corn is slightly trendy but banal. To bring together Siberia, the Pharaohs and the Incas, Mayas and why not Aztecs is rather easy and founded on so little. It is true there is also the theory that everything came from Antarctica with extra-terrestrials and all the paraphernalia of that sort, but that had been used by Aliens and Predators. He apparently preferred Stephen King's approach and his Tommy-knockers but without the cruelty, the vampirism of King, just the subservient gullibility of human beings who believe in a legend and that these strange beings were ready to share. Why not, since they officially did it before. That's one of the big contradictions of this film. These extra-terrestrials are not logical: they don't share their knowledge and they even try to destroy those who help them to move to that twilight zone lying (two meanings) between two universes. I must say Anne Rice's rewriting of these myths and legends is a lot more convincing and creative because she remains essentially human and her beyond belief idea is to bring in both witches and vampires. But these are human somewhere, are our everyday neighbors and friends, not the distant extra-terrestrials, and Anne Rice remains within the scope of human feelings, passions, derangements too but human all the same. The most attractive element is of course the third generation of Joneses. The dear Indiana Jones is finally provided with a son and that son is the one who takes him into the adventure. Hence he is the sequel of the old aging Indiana Jones who repeats he is old and aging so many times that I lost count about 20 minutes after the beginning. And it is true there are a couple of slower moments. But after all it is extremely moral and ethical since the younger Jones is provided with a married couple of parents at the end. Charming. Too charming for Indiana Jones. But we will have to do with that small detail. After all Harrison Ford had to step down in style, that is to say in church.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></body></html>

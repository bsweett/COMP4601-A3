'Javier Bardem' who I am not familiar with proved to be a disturbing and menacing unforgettable force. This film doesn't waste anytime getting to it and it's 2 hour length was time well spent. The violence is sometimes graphic, but there are many violent acts that are implied. One of, if not the best picture I've seen all year. The DVD transfer is excellent and there are some interesting extras.</p></body></html>

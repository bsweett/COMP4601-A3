<meta name="summary" content="Julie's best!"></head><body><p>Disney or not, this is simply Julie Andrews at her very best. Everytime I watch it, I keep thinking how much trouble Mr. Disney had to get the rights to film the project, plus his discovery of Julie in Broadway production of Camelot. They were ready to cast her, but were crossing their fingers for the outcome of the "screentest". Low and behold she took over the cinema screen with a "snap" of a finger.<br />Another comment I might add, is that some might look at the animation sequence as outdated by today's standards, but to follow the story at a closer level, the animation in this movie is about entering a drawn fantasy world via Mary Poppins. The drawing in the story is a pavement picture among many accomplished by an jack of all trades. He even apologizes for any shortcomings his drawings may have to the home audience in mild references. So, with that in mind, it would be out of character (if you will) to have the animation suddenly appear a phenomenal rendering by today's animation standards because in the story it has been drawn by an apologetic part-time artist. And with that, take a better look at that background forest and the architecture of the colorful bridges, they still leave many animators in the country dust!<br />Mary Poppins is, and always will be, Mr. Walt Disney's "crowning achievement". . . make no mistakes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The best Harry Potter movie ever"></head><body><p>Finally Harry Potter is stepping into maturity. This movie looks more PG-13 rated type cause of a darker image, their more action and Harry Potter has grown a bit.<br /><br />The selection ceremony for the Tri-Wizard tournament was humorous. The look of shock on certain characters faces is unforgettable! The tasks are fun and exciting even though I already knew what was going to happen! I thought that the Yule ball was absolutely spectacular, and Ron's dress robes were awesome! The movie was so well done and it does the book justice.<br /><br />Part of this review I copyed off of IMDB.com</p></body></html>

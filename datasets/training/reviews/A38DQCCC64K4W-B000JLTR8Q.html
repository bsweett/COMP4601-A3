It is hard to describe how this movie just roped me in; It is a film of many emotions and layers; It was a pleasure to watch the events unfold in this modern fairy tale. Paul Giamatti was one of the main reasons this worked so well for me; He plays this part so convincingly I never really questioned the plot; I was impressed with the way he interjected both humor and sadness into his character without it ever seeming contrived. The visuals and cinematography captured this apartment world perfectly. The 'colorful' characters(some were better than others)were used nicely, and it was interesting to see how they all came into play during the course of the movie. I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this; It is something fresh and original in a time of many ho-hum, so-so movies. Many will be upset this isn't more of a 'horror' movie; I'm glad it wasn't. Plus I'm a sucker for anything with alot of rain...Do I dare say this is M. Night's most inspired movie yet? Sure, why not.</p></body></html>

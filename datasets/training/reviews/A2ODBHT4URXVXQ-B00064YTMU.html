He's really good in Collateral. He plays a ruthless hit man out to eliminate 5-6 people who might potentially testify in an upcoming high-profile trial. He hops into a cab driven by Max, superbly played (I mean, SUPERBLY) by Jamie Foxx, and sets off on an all-night shooting spree.<br /><br />Cruise doesn't change one whit throughout the film: he's a killing machine, period.<br /><br />But Foxx. Omigod, Jamie Foxx begins as a taxi hack in a nowhere life and slowly becomes the reluctant hero of the film as he valiantly (and very improbably, but hey, this is an action movie, so sit back and just take it on faith) tries to save the life of Cruise's last and ultimate victim: the pretty DA in charge of the case.<br /><br />It's exciting and edge-of-your seat tense throughout, and only 3 things really bothered me: 1) It's not believable that a car would overturn and crash to smithereens without either of the occupants getting more than a bruise, and Cruise's clothes don't even get mussed up, 2) It's not possible for women to run that desperately fast in 3-inch heels, and 3) The very last scene of them outside at dawn overlooking a freeway and parking lot was just...empty. Anticlimactic.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a terrific shoot-`em-up film, if you like this sort of thing.</p></body></html>

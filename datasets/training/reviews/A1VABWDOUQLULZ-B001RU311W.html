Everything about this film was fantastic, except that it could have been about half an hour shorter and been even more stellar.  Aside from pacing issues, every aspect of this film was spot-on:  direction, acting, writing...  It was interesting to see San Francisco presented in a light progressed beyond the idealistic haze of the 60s, yet not having quite reached its hippie goals.  The cultural transition presented in the wider picture of this film is as extraordinary as the depiction of Milk's life.  While Penn is a great actor, I did find that some of the mannerisms he fused into Milk were ones I've seen him do with other characters.  This distracted my spell several times, but his ability to express the gentle kindness of Milk at any given point made up for the unoriginality of physicality.  The film is, of course, terribly sad, for far more reasons than the obvious untimely demise of Milk.  The personal drama that he gave himself over to in creating this revolution is well documented.  A stern reminder that this was not so long ago, it is a must-see film.</p></body></html>

The scene with both of them sleeping in the subway's restroom is more than enough to have made Smith Oscar-nomination worthy.  Only complaint (spoiler warning !): it makes us go through 2 hours of pain & heartbreak while rewarding it with what felt like only a couple of minutes of happiness & redemption.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="David Fincher's Crime Suspence with Difference"></head><body><p>"Zodiac" is a film about one of the famous serial killers, directed by David Fincher who had previously given us "Se7en." You may think Fincher's latest film is made in the same vein as Brad Pitt's hit thriller with his trademark camerawork, but "Zodiac" is actually more like fact-based, dialogue-driven thrillers of the 1970s such as "All the President's Men."<br /><br />But of course "Zodiac" is about the notorious killer (which, it is said, inspired the first "Dirty Harry" film) and it starts with the brutal killing of a young couple in a car. The film includes more than one murder scenes and they are all very scary, or suspenseful at least, but the scare comes from the matter-of-factness of the killer and that of the director, who, instead of gores, opted for the minute descriptions of each case with a surprisingly subdued touch.<br /><br />The film suggests one theory about the identity of the murderer, but Fincher's intention is not clearly to solve this still mysterious case, so please don't demand what you cannot get here, something like sense of closure. He is more interested in the process in which some people were involved in, and attracted to this unusual case, someone like cartooninst-turned-writer Robert Graysmith (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), whose obsession drives him to what he believes is true. And the film is wonderful in showing the credible portraits of the police detectives and the complicated police procedures that are often frustrating.<br /><br />The film is very long (running time about 160 minutes) and its latter half drags a little, which is probably an inevitable thing, considering what happened, or didn't happen, in the real life. But still "Zodiac" is a suspenseful crime drama that keeps fascinating us throughout with its intelligence and details.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Clever but souless"></head><body><p>This is an interesting film which maintains a fine dark gothic feel, blended with elements of the modern thrown in for good measure as well. They could have just called it "Vampires vs Werewolfs", because essentially this just takes the idea from Aliens vs Predators and transposes it for use with two of the best known gothic horror icons.<br /><br />Where it lets itself down is the lack of character development. Yes it has plenty of action. You certainly won't be dissapointed on that front. After a while though you know when you see a lot of people walking purposefully, that they are going to end up in one hell of a fight with or without guns and it happens over and over. In the end I really didn't what happened to any of the characters...<br /><br />One clear influence is The Matrix. The start of the film is almost a direct copy of a famous scene from that film. Many of the characters walk around in long black leather coats which is also a Matrix influence. That said this does have a considerable amount of style and I will be quite happy to watch this again.</p></body></html>

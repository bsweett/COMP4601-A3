<meta name="summary" content="A few slight flaws, but very affecting overall"></head><body><p>This is film has received a lot of heated discussion, so I think I'll keep it relatively short, for once. The big debate surrounds the nonlinear narrative, with many suggesting that it isn't really necessary, and actually hurts the film.  I'll admit, I kinda agree with these people- it ain't really needed.  However, I don't think it really hurts it, even if it is a sorta needless affectation.<br /><br />The unconventional narrative is especially strange considering that this is largely a three person character-study and acting showcase.  Right now I'm gonna reveal a little more of the plot than is typical for the reviews for this.  I don't think it'll hurt you to read it, but consider yourself warned:  '21 Grams' centers around the aftermath of a car accident, focusing on the effects it has on Jack, the man who caused the accident, Cristina, the wife and mother of those who were killed in it, and the terminally ill man, Paul, who receives a heart transplant from one of the victims.  Needless to say, their lives become intertwined afterward.  Honestly, it hasn't got much of a plot at all, really, but the three leads all provide stunning, moving performances.  Benicio Del Toro is the best of them as the bulky and tattooed born-again ex-con who causes the tragic auto accident that sets off the core events of the film.  He's a more complex character than you might expect, as he falls apart, his life which he barely got under some sort of control suddenly collapsing through a combination of bad luck and negligence.  There are a number of scenes of his regret which are just just so sad and powerful.  Frankly, they easily coulda been clich&eacute; and cheap, but Benicio completely pulls them off.  Naomi Watts plays a devastated widow and former druggie who's sliding back to her old life.  Fortunately, the script allows her a wider range than one might anticipate, even if she only expresses anger and grief.  Also, when she starts screaming her head off it's actually believable, both in the performance and the context, a rarity in the films I've seen.  Penn is the weakest of the leads, as Paul, but he's still excellent.  I'm not that big of a Penn fan.  His roles are always convincing, for sure, but his characters have never really struck me as all that interesting. (Seems like everything I've seen him in he's a taciturn cynic who is usually fairly well reserved but has the potential to explode.)  He still plays this basic role much of the time in the film, but he is slowly revealed as the film goes on, and proves to be a truly sympathetic individual at the end.<br /><br />I suppose that's what this all comes down to.  I became very interested in and attached to these characters, moreso than in the vast majority of the other films I've seen.  And frankly, that's not usually the sorta thing I'm big on.  We got plenty of real people in the world, so show me something new, or different or whatever, when you're making a film.  Still, I'll have to admit that most of my very favorite films manage to have a strong human element in them.  The real problem is that most films simply can't pull it off, can't make characters that are real and sympathetic enough to be worth watching.  '21 Grams' does it, or it did for me, anyway.  It is perhaps a little too drawn out, at times, or redundant, or seemed to be at the time anyway, but watching these people is what this movie is about.  Take it or leave it.<br /><br />The film has a grainy, grimy look and appears to have been shot with handheld cameras almost exclusively.  Some have complained about this, but I like the gritty look, particularly the colors.  It is pretty damn grainy at times, I'll admit, but again, I'm pretty sure that's how it's meant to be.  It's got a sad, stirring soundtrack as well, mostly used relatively sparingly.  The dialogue is fluid and natural, but still with a few of those powerful, memorable 'movie moments' that probably wouldn't ever happen in real life, but you buy them anyway.<br /><br />I dunno if there is that much more to say.  With a film like this it's tough to really say why it works so well.  You'll just have to see for yourself.  It's certainly not for everyone, as the unconventional structure will irritate some, the slow pace others, and the exceedingly dark subject matter still others.  And, honestly, it is perhaps the slightest bit pretentious.  But, it reaches high enough that the fact that it thinks it's a maybe a little bit more than it is doesn't hurt it too much, when you look at what it has got.<br /><br />Edit: After watching this movie a second time I am somewhat less impressed.  The fact that none of it really adds up too anything in particular proves more irritating the second time thru, and the performances lose a bit of their impact.  Still, it's very good, but I'd probably now bring it down to 4 stars, if I were allowed to do so.<br /><br />Hmm, turns out that wasn't so short after all.<br /><br />Grade: B+</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I have not laughed as hard all year as I did at the scene..."></head><body><p>...involving all the vomit. The sex scene got all the attention from critics and pundits but for my money, the extended regurgitation scene took the prize.  I realize some people probably found it disgusting but they were probably watching the wrong movie.<br /><br />And maybe I'm just jaded but I actually didn't think it was as raunchy as it's rep proclaimed.  There's actually kind of a sweet undercurrent to the whole thing, despite the fact that it's basically making fun of the left, right and everyone in between.<br /><br />Another highlight: Kim Jong Il's musical number.  In fact, all the songs were dead-on parodies.  You really have to pay attention to pop country anthems to nail them the way Parker and Stone did.<br /><br />The extra features on the disc are pretty good, too.  I never thought watching puppeteers could be so interesting.</p></body></html>

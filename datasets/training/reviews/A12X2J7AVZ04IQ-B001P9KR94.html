I enjoyed it a lot; life's lessons can teach a lot more than most schools.This is a finely crafted film, thanks to the always wonderful Danny Boyle; a whole bunch of wonderful kid-actors make the flash-back moments so hopefully  heartfelt.A wonderful cast. The amazing editing and brilliant photography add to the progression of the plot at large, showing past & present. I was impressed that this simple story, that almost didn't find a distributor, appeared to the public.  This is a feel-good film, but subtitles may keep some Oscar voters away. The Oscars have made lots of mistakes; the absence of Dev Patel as a nominee is just another Oscar travesty.  It's as earnest a performance as I've seen. "Crouching Tiger", Life is Beautiful", "Z", "The Emigrants", and other foreign language films have been darlings at the Oscars, all sub-titled. "Slumdog Millionaire" is a worthy film. Kids should see it to know the importance of "learned knowledge", though the subtitles may not make it as accessible to the general public (and kids). I was moved by this film, and the impeccable artistry for a "small" film. Bravo, Danny Boyle! UPDATE: Benjamin Button was a much better cinematic achievement. It should've won.</p></body></html>

HOST seems interminable and its stop/start rhythm irritates and bores quickly. When it eventually lumbers to a climax, instead of getting our pulses racing, the director decides to go for a molasses-slow elegiac sequence presumably critiquing industrial society and man's alienated place in it. One family tragedy was enough, I would of thought, and this second nose-dive into the maudlin is writing a cheque the audience just can't cash.<br /><br />Appropriately, this is a stinker.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Basically a propaganda film masquerading as a dark comedy"></head><body><p>While I do like Nicolas Cage as an actor, I didn't think this movie deserved the critical praise it has received.  The movie cost about $40 million to make and only did $24 million in U.S. box office (but $62 million world wide), so I think the public got it about right.  What is the problem with the movie?  Well, first of all, and there are exceptions to this, if the story is mostly told in narration and the movie is used to illustrate the narration, it usually means the screenplay has real problems.  And that is certainly true here.  It would be incoherent without the Nicolas Cage voice over.<br /><br />Another big problem with the movie is that it not only has a point of view, and not only has that point of view brightly attached to its sleeve, I felt like I was viewing a propaganda film against the arms trade.  Yes, it is a film against the arms trade, and that is fine (if you want to make a film about that), but it doesn't try to be balanced in any way.  It is really a smear of arms and arms dealers by loading them up - particularly Cage's character (Yuri Orlov) - with all kinds of reptilian and decadent traits; almost inhuman.  After all, how could you sell weapons to people who were going to use them against civilians unless you were a monster?  Never mind, that in the key scene in the movie the weapons we see used on a woman and child are machetes, which can be made anywhere out of any kind of steel you can put an edge on and attach a handle to.<br /><br />Look, I am not arguing FOR the arms trade, just against the way it is portrayed in this movie.  It probably is corrupt and surreal.  However, they point out that this story is based on actual events.  Except that when you watch the extra features we learn that the Ukrainian the story is based on lived in Italy, not the U.S. and he got off because of a loophole in Italian law rather than being protected by corrupt officials in the U.S. government who used him to keep the fingerprints off of some deals.  Now, that may well be done, I don't know.  But real events showing such transactions were not shown in this film.<br /><br />Still, the movie has some pretty funny scenes (funny in a very dark way).  However, there is real violence - beginning with the powerful opening montage (done in computer graphics) of the life of a bullet for an AK-47 from its being made in Russia until it is used in Africa.  There is also some very sexual scenes and depictions of drug use - again to show how the arms trade saps the humanity out of those who practice it.  Pretty heavy handed depictions, too.<br /><br />So, if you are interested in another film blasting blood diamonds, the weapons trade, and the major world governments -  but particularly the character of Americans, hey this is a movie for you.</p></body></html>

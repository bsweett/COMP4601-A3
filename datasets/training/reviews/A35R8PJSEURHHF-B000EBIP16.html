The movie followed the cartoon version very closely and it was amazing to see it brought to life.  I was teary eyed through most of the movie, it really moved me. Some of the mystical creatures gave me a chuckle because they looked silly and it almost seemed like watching Xena...but i thought the scenery and especially the music was wonderful.  You really get wrapped up in it and I think I liked the beautiful white snow instead of the lush green.  So, anyway, if you did watch the cartoon version you won't be disappointed.</p></body></html>

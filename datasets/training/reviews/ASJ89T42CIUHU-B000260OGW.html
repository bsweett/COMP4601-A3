<meta name="summary" content="Open Up To A Modern Western"></head><body><p>Kevin Costner has brought the simplicity of an old western movie into a new age and done a fantastic job, both as an actor and as director.<p>The storyline for this film is a bit bland and basic but the intensity of acting and the scenery make up for the lack of substance in the story. &quot;Open Range&quot; takes you into a real western setting where one could see for miles and miles only what God made and be humbled by it. The gunfight is fantastic and so much more than any found in the good old western movies. <p>Robert Duvall is perfect as Boss, an old grubby cowboy with heart. Opposite Duvall you would think Costner would pale in comparision but he fits in almost as perfectly as a man with a mystery past. Annette Bening is subtle in her role, as a doctor's sister, but no less important to the film as Costner and Duvall. But the most impressive character in this film is by far the western scenery and the reality of nature's wrath out in the open range of 1882.</p></body></html>

I have the other standard DVD so I didn't see the need to peek at this one.  Wow!  Three discs.  One features the 2002 remastering, disc two the 1982 version (Just a tad more violent) and disc 3 has all the behind the scenes goodies.  There's the soundtrack album CD and a wonderful book included in this set.  It was scheduled to go out of print two years ago.  If you can get one do so.  It is well worth the money.  It is the ultimate on E.T.  Everything you ever wanted to read, see, or hear about E.T. is in this box set.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Alien......."></head><body><p>Alien is a science fiction horror film that was made in 1979 and directed by Ridley Scott. It stars Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm, John Hurt, and Yaphet Kotto. It's mainly about the crew of spaceship Nostromo who go to answer a distress call of unknown origin on a distant planet before reaching Earth only to be stalked by an extremely aggressive extraterrestrial creature whom we all have come to know as Aliens. The film, itself, has garnered both critical acclaim and box office success, receiving an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction for Scott, and Best Supporting Actress for Cartwright, and a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, along with numerous other award nominations. The film has spawned books, toys, videogames, and comic books due to its' success and, even today, is still considered one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. In my opinion, that's deservedly so.<br /><br />What makes this movie so great? The fact that it deliberately paces itself and builds up tension in the viewer with a great payoff in the end. Not only that but Director Ridley Scott gives you a visual aspect in the movie that's not seen before this film. The screenplay as well as the cast are rock solid enough that you invest in each of the characters. It's not your normal sci-fi movie, where too much time is spent on special effects and not on storyline.<br /><br />Except for the sequel, Aliens, no other movie in the series(I'm afraid) holds up quite as much as this one does. Don't get me wrong, Sigourney Weaver's performance in all of them are exceptional and each movie is well made but none build up the tension quite as much and hits quite as hard as this movie does. The Amazon reviewer who calls this movie overrated and drawn out is plain silly. Don't believe everything you read, folks...everyone percieves things differently.<br /><br />According to the 2003 commentary track for the Alien DVD included in the Alien Quadrilogy set, Sigourney Weaver expressed interest in doing a fifth Alien movie with Scott returning to direct. That means we may not have seen the last of Ripley or of the Aliens. Honestly, I would love it if they did. Even though AvP/AvP:Requiem are good movies, they need to continue each series separately to keep anticipation high.</p></body></html>

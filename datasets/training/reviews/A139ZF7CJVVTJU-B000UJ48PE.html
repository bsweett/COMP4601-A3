<meta name="summary" content="Tortured To Death"></head><body><p>The most obvious difference between this film and its predecessor is that instead of three fellows facing off against the Slovakian "hunting club," we now have three gals:  the wealthy Beth (Lauren German), the socially stunted Lorna (Heather Matarazzo), and slutty Whitney (Bijou Phillips, or as I like to call her, The Forehead).<br /><br />Hostel wasn't just a sweaty-palmed gore-fest with an aura of believability to its sadism.  It was also a rather clever (if not heavy-handed) jab at the whole idea of exploitation.  Three backpackers roll like over-fed sows in the cultural trough of an ethically lax and economically crippled Europe, getting wasted and trying to score hot foreign chicks.  When that fails, they buy their hot foreign chicks at the Red Light District.  Irony of ironies, they find out that their flesh is also for sale.<br /><br />That sort of grim self-reflection is missing in the sequel, which has less to do with courage, redemption, and missing limbs than it does with backstory.  Most of this installment explains the workings of The Organization, giving the audience a closer look at the men (and women) who pay for the right to kill, and the steps (fiduciary as well as mental) that they must go through to get that priveledge.  It's an interesting take on an interesting idea, but it collapses as soon as the movie realizes that very few people want to actually sympathize with people who have this much blood on the brain.<br /><br />Speaking of which.  Even gore-hungry viewers who couldn't care less about ironic meanings and subtle symbols will not be sated by this go-around, either.  Forget suspense, tension, or creative carnage.  With the exception of one obscenely graphic moment that will make every man in the theater cross his legs and cringe, this installment falls far short of its big brother in the blood and guts department.<br /><br />Perhaps Roth was playing to the minds and the pockets that made the first "Hostel" such a success, relying on his already-established mythos to provide the token eeriness and appeal.  In some ways, this is admirable -- two rich American businessmen get a good look at their own hearts when they are offered the chance to rip out someone else's.  (As one of them, actor Richard Burgi plays the moment with perfectly precise and horrific grace (even if, for most of the movie, I kept picturing him in his role as the "breathtaking" doctor from Seinfeld.)  In other ways, it's repetitive and boring (soooooo many chase scenes).<br /><br />What consolations the movie does offer are far too fine and fleeting, especially for a film that has such a meaty reputation to live up to.  Most of the expected elements are here -- ultra dark comedy, the Bubblegum Kids, gratuitous nudity, people screaming -- but the movie is missing perhaps the most important element of all: guts.<br /><br />In every definition of the word.</p></body></html>

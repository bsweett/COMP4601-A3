I watched the new version of the film and then re-watched the old one and the old one was so much better.  The child actors played the parts especially better than the children in the new version of the movie.  The new one is just over-the-top and seems to force computer technology in our faces to make up for the lame acting.  If you loved the original, this will be fun to watch and compare, but you will find yourself being loyal to the old version. Worth a rent, but that's it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very Good Film. But, Has Some Weak Spots"></head><body><p>I like Land Of The Dead and also I like the Urated Director's Cut, too. However, this is Romero's weakest story of his Dead Saga. The story was good, but not a masterpiece like his last 3 Dead films. Big Daddy {Clark} is a cool character, but Bub from Day Of THe Dead was a better character.<br /><br />This film didn't end like a Romero film, to me, the ending was weak, but I'm not gonna say for those who didn't see it.<br /><br />But, I do like a lot of the characters in this films. The action and gore scenes are definitley cool. And like I said, the story is good, it's just weak compare to the other Dead films.<br /><br />If this was done by another director, it would be a more than very good. But, this is Romero's work, and it's kinda weak for his style. It is worth buying and it's very good to watch many times over.</p></body></html>

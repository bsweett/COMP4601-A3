<meta name="summary" content="Eagle Eye, A Stolen Idea For A New Generation, But Still Awesome"></head><body><p>Remember 40 years ago, there was a movie brought out called 2001: A Space Odyssey and it is long considered one of Stanley Kubricks greatest works? Well in that movie it contained a short story involving an advanced computer called HAL, who gained independent intelligence and tried to eliminate all astronauts on board his space station. That idea has been parodied and ripped off so many times it's laughable, with the TV shows such as The Simpsons and Futurama giving their own parody of it along with the most recent movie Stealth using the idea as a basis for their own movie. Hell, it even sort of looked like HAL and if that's not a ripoff I don't know what is, seriously.<br /><br />Eagle Eye is no exception to that rule as it takes the HAL idea of a powerful computer killing people and taking control and puts a terrorism twist on it. Jerry Shaw is the twin brother of Ethan Shaw, a soldier we're first lead to believe is killed in some form of action. After that event Jerry gets home to his apartment to find it's filled with munitions supplies and explosive chemicals. He receives a call from a female telling him the FBI are about to enter his apartment to arrest him and to get out. On the other side, Rachel Holloman gets a call from the same woman who tells her that her son Sam will be killed unless she follows the instructions. Jerry is caught by the FBI the first time, but the woman on the phone who's hacked into all United States networks breaks him out by smashing a crane into the building allowing Jerry an escape route. Jerry winds up with Rachel and it now leads into a chase/mission for them to try and save their own necks by following the womans instructions and keep from getting caught by the FBI who suspect them of being Cyber Terrorists. About a quarter into the film we find out that the woman on the phone is an artificially intelligent super computer located in the Pentagon. It's reason for creation is to automatically seek out, monitor and alert the authorities of a suspected threat to national security (this one again looks like HAL).<br /><br />Although the blatant ripoff material is there, this is still an intensely enjoyable film with some of the best action sequences I've seen in a film this year. The acting by Shia Labeouf and even Billy Bob Thornton is excellent, obviously the supporting actress of Michelle Monoghan is something great and again Shia delivers a stellar performance, constantly cementing his status as an all round excellent actor. A top 10 movie of 08 for me and we've had some excellent movies this year, so that's saying something.</p></body></html>

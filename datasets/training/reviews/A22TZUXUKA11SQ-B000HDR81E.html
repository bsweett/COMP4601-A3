<meta name="summary" content="Not another romantic comedy"></head><body><p>In The Break Up, Vince Vaughn plays Gary, a Chicago tour bus guide, who falls for Brooke, an art gallery employee played by Jennifer Aniston.  The two should live happy ever after in a perfect world, but in the world of romantic comedies things come crashing down when it becomes evident that they don't want the same thing from their relationship.  Gary is still at a point in his life where he doesn't want to accept responsibility for his actions or act like an adult.  Brooke realizes that she can't change him and that she might have to accept that the man-child she fell in love with is always going to be that way.<br /><br />After a fight, Brooke basically says she's through trying, though she never actually breaks up with Gary.  In fact, the title of The Break Up is misleading because the characters aren't actually officially "broken up" for the first half of the movie.  They've had a fight after which neither of them wants to acknowledge any wrongdoing, but each is just waiting for the other to apologize.  In my estimation, this does not a break up make.  In fact, it's more like the Ross/Rachel "on a break" than a concrete end to the relationship.<br /><br />Gary's alpha male attitude and refusal to acquiesce to Brooke's will is about 75% of the hilarity of this movie. The supporting best friend characters played by Jason Bateman, Joey Lauren Adams, and Jon Favreau offer sparse moments of humor but not enough. Overall, the funniest part of the movie is the first half hour, and it loses steam slowly from then on.  If you're not a fan of unresolved endings, be forewarned that this one was disappointing to say the least.</p></body></html>

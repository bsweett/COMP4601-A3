I love that he took out that long coat with the cut up gloves that he is known for in the 80s. I love the movie it was silly but I enjoyed my self and I had a few laughs and thought they all did good together I think John Cusack is so accomplish with the serious roles he has been in since the 90s so to come back to do a silly movie was fun and surprising. It's like a combination of old school and animal house.</p></body></html>

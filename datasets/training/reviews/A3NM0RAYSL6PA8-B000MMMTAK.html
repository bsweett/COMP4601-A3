After all, he has contrived a way to get ordinary people to open their hearts and minds and let all their darkness and bigotry come spilling out. In the end, I think it's way more subtle and sophisticated than it seems. But that's only part of the story. Not all of the "victims" of Borat's pranks are unsympathetic. There are some who are well-meaning, altruistic, and sympathetic to this seemingly lovable idiot from an alien land where, he manages to convince them, men drink fermented horse urine and make women ride on the outside of buses. And that's the rub. Cohen is making sport of the good and bad, the innocent and racist, with one fat brush. Through his eyes, the world is populated with sloppy, boorish, ignorant, and sometimes really, really nice fools that smart people can make sport of relentlessly.<br /><br />After all, you'd have to be a complete idiot to believe that there is a country where gays wear blue hats, men brag about their sisters' oral sex skills, Jews are feared as shape-shifting demons, and no one knows how to use a toilet. The sad truth, however, is that a lot of decent, well-meaning and sympathetic types take Borat at face value -- not because of stupidity or idiocy -- but because they're perfect targets for a fraud. And that's exactly what Sacha Baron Cohen really is -- a good old-fashioned fraud. He's the embodiment of reality TV, the rich bachelor who isn't, the bold-faced lie.<br /><br />And, in the end, though I laughed and laughed and felt kind of sick about it afterwards, Cohen a pretty sick and talented schmuck. He's great a making fools of people, and, like the crowd on the school bus that laughed at the clumsy doofus with the banana-shaped head (I think every school bus has one), we laugh along with Cohen at how stupid, pathetic, and flawed people are. Laugh, laugh, laugh.<br /><br />I couldn't help but smile when I learned that, during his promotional blitz in character, a New Yorker who wasn't having any of it began to deliver a nice beating to Mr. Cohen. A cynical person might be saddened to learn that  someone broke it up.</p></body></html>

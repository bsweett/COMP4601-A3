<meta name="summary" content="More reality than fiction."></head><body><p>If you have any experience with a large corporation as of late, Up In The Air is a film that may make you squirm with emotional discomfort. The recognition of the cold, unresponsive attitude of upper management driven to have greater profits at the expense of a loyal work force seen only as "inventory" is almost too much to watch. Up In The Air is character driven, and the thin story is played out through those experiences.<br /><br />I both loved and hated this film. The knowledge that Clooney's charming and handsome portrayal of a corporate hatchet person was just that -- charming and handsome -- did nothing, for me, to soften the ultimate recognition that these positions are often filled by sociopaths who glory in the opportunity to damage others. Jason Bateman's cavalier approach to this business was perfection as he found new and more damaging ways to suck more profits from his trade.<br /><br />I could not help but view Up In The Air through a lens of current financial and corporate reality, and the experiences of friends and family around me. It's hard to believe that anyone could view it without being smacked in the face by the real pain suggested here. See this film, but only if you feel you could deal with renewing that pain in all of Hollywood's "glory."</p></body></html>

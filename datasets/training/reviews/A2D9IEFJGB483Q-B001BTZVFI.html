<meta name="summary" content="Anti-Fantastic Four"></head><body><p>This film is not a betrayal, but it is a half betrayal.  You can excuse the ham-handed politically correct insertions.  You can semi-forgive the retconning of Dr. Doom as Ultimate Doom.  Moreover, the scriptwriters made him another run-of-the Hollywood-Script-Mill evil businessman (OsCorp, LexCorp, now DoomCorp), instead of the satanic genius and materialist magician that C. S. Lewis Spoke about (Screwtape Letters).  And you almost cannot forgive the lack of the over-the-top action and suspense that makes a movie worth seeing.<br /><br />This films main problem is that the plot is one of destruction, specifically the self-destruction of the Fantastic Four.  We spend 106 minutes watching the Fantastic For try and figure out a way to undo the miracle that gave them powers.<br /><br />Essentially, this is a snuff film-the FF want to commit suicide!<br /><br />As Campbell points out, each hero goes through a "Refusal of the Call," and eventually snaps out of it and follows through with the quest.  The FF spend the entire film refusing the Call, and finally cross the threshold in the last 15 minutes.  This worked for Unbreakable, but the film is more psychological, serous, and minimalist.<br /><br />We expect Ben Grimm (marvelously played by Chiklis) to refuse the call, since he is so hideous, and Johnny Storm is the only one who finds the powers empowering, but he is such an airhead, it is meaningless.  Reed and Sue mainly focus on their relationship, and odd posing for the camera.<br /><br />What makes Ben Grimm so likeable is that he is the only one who comes to really comes to terms with his powers, and fully accepts the calling as a hero.<br /><br />So how to improve for FF2? First, get in touch with Dooms' Satanic side. Have him undergo some jackball Latvarian-Transylvanian rite that restores him to life.<br /><br />Second-the heroes have come to terms with their powers.  Now explore their powers.  The Thing and Alicia Masters need to be taken to the next level; Johnny should get fed up with being  a flaming gigolo, and begin with Reed and Sue's wedding.<br /><br />Keep the lighthearted humor (the plastic surgeon joke was classic), and the inside jokes (Franklin Richards is Reed's firstborn).  You have thirty years of FF material, take a poll form the fans.  Hmmm . . .how about Galactus?</p></body></html>

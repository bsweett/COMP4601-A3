<meta name="summary" content=""True Bloods"Ryan Kwantan{Jason}staring role"></head><body><p>I wanted to see a film with "True Blood"star ,Ryan Kwantan."Dead Silence"is not bad,but I wouldn't want to watch it again.Ryan does a great job,and the ending is scary especially if you are scared of creepy dolls coming to life,and its not a happy ending for Ryan.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Captain America: The First Avenger ......"></head><body><p>Captain America: The First Avenger, in my opinion, is this summer's top superhero movie. Heck, it might even be the best movie of 2011, period. Forget X-Men: First Class, Thor or Green Lantern. I'll have to say it, when noone else will, that this has to be Marvel's best, thus far.<br /><br />The movie, basically, tells the origin of how Cap came to be with him going up against The Red Skull(who himself is a super soldier). There's plenty of action and the performances of the cast are top-notch and believable. Chris Evans plays Cap much better than he did as The Human Torch in Fantastic Four(which I always questioned anyhow). He's definitely more physical in this movie, with all the action he does.<br /><br />However, where I find fault in the movie, The Red Skull doesn't get much screen time in the movie and-for that reason- he doesn't seem to be THAT serious of a threat to me. In the comics, The Red Skull is maniacal and is hellbent on threatening all humanity and making good on it. Like the original Batman movie(by Tim Burton), I was expecting the movie to portray the villain in as close a manner as he was in the comics but was disappointed that he wasn't. I can't find fault in Hugo Weaving, though. He did an excellent job as The Red Skull. Too, the conclusion of the movie seemed awkward and forced. I find fault in Director Joe Johnston, who seemed more concerned in laying down the origin and foundation for the upcoming Avengers movie. Not that that is a bad thing as it isn't but(..). With the sequel, however, he better 1-up everything...if he wants Cap to continue as a viable movie franchise. I suggest he looks to the Iron Man movies for inspiration or bow out while the gettin' is good and let someone else give it a shot. I know that's being critical but Cap deserves better.<br /><br />Other than that, Captain America: The First Avenger is a great movie. One of Marvel's best, if not THE best.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Apocalypto"></head><body><p>`Apocalypto' follows a mayan tribe after a group of marauders sweep in and capture village members for slaves and human sacrifices. Shot entirely in the Yucatec dialect and with subtitles, this lends some authenticity to the story and in no way detracts from the rollercoaster ride this film takes you on. There are touching scenes of family life that are quickly shattered by extreme and brutal violence and some of these scenes are quite graphic in places. The various actors play their roles superbly and Gibson's direction is as flawless as ever. Say what you will about the man, he has artistic vision if nothing else. The score is composed by James Horner and you my recognise the discordant pipe sounds also used in Braveheart at various tension filled moments in this film and the overall score is understated and spare. The colours really immerse you in this film, rich ochre's and earth tones, vivid blues of the sacrificial paint and muted jade all combine to create a palate of beauty that add a great deal to the overall feel. The story will keep you gripped for the 2 ? hour length and it doesn't feel anywhere near as long as this, once you connect to the characters and are in the story, you're hooked and completely engrossed. Despite the negative press around Gibson that inevitably coloured the hype around this film, this is a solidly directed and acted film and is well worth a look.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

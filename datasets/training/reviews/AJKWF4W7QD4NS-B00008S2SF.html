<meta name="summary" content="Best Bond in a while"></head><body><p>The ante for just about everything has been upped for Die Another Day; the 20th film in the James Bond film franchise.  Pierce Brosnan once again reprises his role as the suave secret agent as we find him imprisoned and tortured in a Korean prison camp for 14 months (which begins with a slam bang action sequence).  Later on, Bond is out for revenge against his betrayers, and soon runs into the mysterious Jynx (Halle Berry) who herself is a spy with an agenda.  Brosnan is at his usual best as 007, while Berry provides ample eye candy, but her acting talents aren't necessarily put to use.  The rest of the cast includes the returning Judi Dench and John Cleese as M and Q respectively, and also Toby Stephens, Rosamund Pike, Rick Yune, Michael Madsen, and Colin Salmon.  Director Lee Tamahori manages to keep the film packed with enough momentum even without action on the screen, and even as the action scenes and situations borderline on the ridiculous, you can't help but keep yourself glued to the screen.  Die Another Day is far from being the best Bond film, but compared to the previously disappointing The World is Not Enough, this is far superior.  MGM has assembled a fantastic DVD package here; Disc 2 is packed with loads of special features while the film itself looks and sounds fantastic.</p></body></html>

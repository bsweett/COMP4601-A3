It had been out for some time by the time I'd finally seen it. My ex was shocked beyond belief I'd never watched it, so he sat me down and made me watch it. He & I are still friends so even to this day, I still thank him for introducing me to this amazing movie. Plenty of other reviewers have detailed the plot. Even if this isn't the usual kind of movie you'd tend to grab off the rack, just do it. You won't be disappointed. It's captivating and smart and the ending is awesome. No matter how many times I watch it, I still adore it. Kevin Spacey is amazing, but then again, he always is in my book.</p></body></html>

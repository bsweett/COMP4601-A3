<meta name="summary" content="Mirror mirror on the wall, which is the best Disney movie?"></head><body><p>After much discussion our family ranked this Disney classic as their 6th favorite out of the 41 cartoon based movies we own.  Of all the old classic cartoons, SWAT7D probably contributed for to the Walt Disney World theme park than any other movie.  Snow White herself, the most evil bad guy, the step mother witch, the 7 dwarfs, the diamond mine, the poison apple and the mirror on the wall are all familiar pictures in the culture even today.<br />Some had said this is their favorite family movie and I can't blame them.  We only gave 7 of the 41 a 5 star rating, what we called the magnificent 7.  But, Mirror mirror on the wall, which is the best Disney movie of all?  The debate was fun.<p>We had a lot of fun by gathering the family together to rank the 41 Disney movies we have that include some cartoon work. All the kids, ages 6 to 27, participated along with mother and dad. Peter Pan is no Codfish, we rank it #2. Lion King was selected number 1 of the 41 as the family favorite, but narrowly. Peter Pan was 2. Pete's Dragon 3, Beauty &amp; the beast 4 and Sleeping Beauty 5.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's the dialog"></head><body><p>The plot of Spartan has some nice twists in it. The acting is adequate. Kilmer is good as always. The characters are interesting. The dialog is terse and very good. There is a shorthand in the communication between the characters that makes me feel that I am only seeing  a small glimpse of very different world from which I live. It is a dark, cold world where every one has motivations for their actions that no one else can guess. The characters are cold, but engaging.<br /><br />There are small plot holes and the denouement is wrapped up a little too smoothly, but I recommend the movie.</p></body></html>

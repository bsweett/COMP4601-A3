<meta name="summary" content="Live hard or die free...or whatever"></head><body><p>The 10 years later sequel to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77SQS">Die Hard Series</a> gets the whole Bruce Willis as Action Hero thing correct. Lots of crap blows up, plenty of rah-rah guy patriotism, new oddball sidekick, oily villain, and plenty of corny wisecracks from the mouth of John McClane. It's amazingly fast paced and a few of the stunts were wildly inventive (although the main ones are in the trailer). There's even a scene stealing cameo from Kevin Smith, playing the King Warlock of All Hackers.<br /><br />The plot: Timothy Olyphant as a disgruntled ex-Fed out for revenge (and cash) against an inept Homeland Security that threw him out in disgrace after he kept insisting their computer system could be easily compromised. He secretly recruits a bunch of Uber-Nerds to crack - one by one - different security codes and then eliminates the hackers. Olyphant's Thomas Gabriel then sets about gleefully causing anarchy as the Government is exposed as inept and unprepared. It's up to McClane and Matt, the last surviving Super Nerd (Justin Long), to outwit, outlast and outhack Olyphant and his evil-doers.<br /><br />That's the good. The bad is the usual hokiness (Olyphant's villain is totally without depth) and the overall implausibility of things (a stealth fighter plane being repeatedly unable to hit its target?). After three movies of not having children, John McClane suddenly has a daughter, Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). She finds herself in the kind of ridiculous sub-plot peril that Elisha Cuthbert would stink up episodes of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008YGRU">'24'</a> with. There are a few nit-picky factual errors (there are no Yellow Cabs in DC, for instance), but that is something you'd only know if you were from there.<br /><br />Overall, "Live Free Or Die Hard" runs its course with more flair than most, due primarily to Willis' memorable go at McClane. To the filmakers' credit, they didn't try to make him young again, which would have been a mistake. Other than the Lucy Subplot, everything stays on course, delivered with just enough suspense and humor to make it an enjoyable, better than average actioner.</p></body></html>

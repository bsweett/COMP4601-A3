<meta name="summary" content="Juno?  No, I Most Certainly Don't."></head><body><p>Film focus groups, an abomination, have been around a long time.  This is where creative integrity is swapped out for box office bank-ability, assuming there was any there to begin with.  Various different endings and permutations of all types are tried out on a small handful of people in the dark.  Then, movies are trimmed and tailored to suit their tastes.  (Originality stands little chance.)  Well, apparently there are now Sundance focus groups.  How else could one explain the popularity of Juno, a movie whose sole purpose in life seems to be pleasing the smug, self-consciously hip judges at that increasingly less independent film festival.<br /><br />In this case affixing blame is easy, it belongs in its entirety to Diablo Cody who wrote the screenplay.  In the history of film has there ever been a character as improbable as Juno MacGuff?  Has there ever been a story more stupid, or confused about what it wants to say?  Juno begins as a surly, edgy, dark outcast and ends up just shy of the yearbook committee.  Her glib, sarcastic persona must have seemed delicious to those cool cats at Sundance, but the way adults buy into her dismissive attitude is preposterous.  Only the ultrasound technician, (Kaaren de Ziva), speaks to her and her ilk as they should be addressed, irresponsible and vulgar children.  The inevitable 3rd act reconciliations, emotional growth spurts, and newfound harmonies are beyond hokey and facile, and as for Paulie, the boyfriend she now loves, I have encountered loaves of Wonderbread with more personality.  We are supposed to buy that she has anything in common with him?<br /><br />Director Jason Reitman and a wonderful cast are to be heartily congratulated for transforming this three-legged duckbilled platypus into something resembling a movie.  Ellen Page really is remarkable as Juno; she takes a character more ludicrous than Batman and makes her seem real.  Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons, two reliable veterans, are extremely good as mom and dad.  Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are just acceptable as the prospective adopters.  I don't know if Michael Cera, Paulie, is good or not.  If he was intended to be completely vapid, uninteresting, and unattractive, then perhaps he's good.<br /><br />If you have any doubts about how bad this movie actually is, watch Little Miss Sunshine again.  Both films want to hit the same marks, Sunshine hits them, Juno self-consciously attempts to hit them.  It's like watching a couple dance; except they're following the footprints in an Arthur Murray Dance Studio.  Speaking of which, beware of the score featuring songs by Kimya Dawson.  Never has so much precious, pretentious, cutesy-poo teenage angst been packed into such a short amount of time - unbearable.</p></body></html>

Jude Law, dude, you got to work out more, you'll be the first actor to come to mind for a new version of "Gumby". Jude Law has the sexual attention of both Roberts and cute as a vixen on fire with a whip, Natalie Portman, and the geeky nerd chooses the older, stiff as a board Roberts. Dysfunctional? Maybe. Stupid? Absolutely. Clive Owen marries Roberts and after a marital indiscretion, retreats to watch Portman do a slinky striptease pole dance. I should have such troubles. Anyway, love is hate and hate is love, or something like that. Julia Roberts barks out a mouthfull of obscenities, ripping open a sexual current not unlike an audio Hustler magazine teaser sound bite. Grrrroooowwll! Natalie Portman has a great lower back. Fish swim in The London Aquarium. Clive Owen, dude, if you can sing, if this acting thing don't work out, you could be the next Tom Jones. Natalie Portman, smart move. SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!  She looks around at the other actors and says, "Hey, you guys ain't thirtysomethings! You're all fortysomethings and Julia is ... I'm gonna beat it and find a younger crowd to swing with." Sweet move, darling. You'll always find work.</p></body></html>

'Braveheart,' 'The Passion of Christ,' and, now 'Apocalypto' all are violent in epic proportions.  'Apocalypto' is startlingly savage.  This time we have the historical fiction presented with a happy Mayan village.  Complete with warriors and hunters we are given some colorful characters--not just from their face paint--including a misfit who isn't able to provide fertility.  One day they unsuspectingly come across another tribe--one that will provide menace for the sleeping village.  They are later raped and pillaged, and the survivors are shackled under a common yoke.  We find that they are brought to Mayan civilization where they will be made a sacrifice to their pagan god to appease all misfortune, including crop disasters.<br /><br />The presentation is certainly remarkable enough as the village hero, Jaguar's Paw, escapes on a harrowing journey that reminds one of the most urgent rendering of 'Lord of the Flies' that's yet to be presented.  The startling savagery comes to the fore with fearless detail.  The cinematography is masterful and their predicament is framed in every scene.  Some of the moon shots and New Age wind instrumentation is reminiscent of 'The Passion of Christ,' but 'Apocalypto' is a group project with a whole tribe in view--even if one hero is its focal point.  Anguish and a sweeping chase are skillfully presented in yet another Mel masterpiece.<br /><br />(Hollywood has presented two opposing viewpoints this year, whose contrast is a telling dichotomy.  There's 'The Da Vinci Code' and Professor Teabing's take that Constantine (an ancient and non-fiction historical figure) and Silas (a modern but fictional character) represent the strife and brutality that Christianity has dispensed in its two thousand year history.  And, then there's Mel's portrayal of one pagan civilization that was brutal until it was tamed by Spanish conquistadors.  A telling contrast.)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I love ya Charlize but this Sci-Fi film was so mediocore."></head><body><p>The movie was a horrible disappointment to me. I felt betrayed. They took the idea of one of my favorite animated characters, squeezed all the depth and personality out of her, and pumped her full of Hollywood clich?s. The essence of the animated series was completely lost in this movie.<br /><br />In the animated series:<br /><br />Aeon Flux was an amoral rebel that was completely detached from everything and everyone. She was cruel, selfish, loving, unpredictable, witty, caustic, confident, sarcastic, lethal, untamable, and ambiguous all at once. The original Aeon had layers upon layers of depth. She almost never allowed her personal emotions to show through. The original plot was deliciously ambiguous and thought provoking. You could never tell what Aeon's motives were. Aeon was a militant anarchist whereas Trevor was a radical idealist, because of this they could never have any semblance of a stable relationship.<br /><br />In the movie:<br /><br />Aeon Flux works for the Monicans and her political motives and personal motives are very clear. She was pretty, loving, vulnerable, easily tamable, emotional and very predictable. The Aeon in the movie had one layer of depth at most. The plot was obvious and contrived. Everything is completely laid out for you from the beginning. There was virtually no conflict between Aeon and Trevor, at least in terms of personal philosophies. The only conflict between them was that they were on different sides.<br /><br /> The only reason why I'm giving this movie two star is because the visuals were incredible. It was neat to see some of the familiar animated scenes like the fly in the eye done with CGI. Visually, stylistically, and with its energy and futuristic fantasy (and constantly under-dressed heroine). In that, it reminds me strongly of Fifth Element - another film where we feel as if we only get a glimpse of a futuristic, colorful world full of strangely dressed people, without the need to explain or expose every aspect of it. Again great actress, mediocore film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Narnia is Just an Appetizer Before the Main Dish...KING KONG"></head><body><p>I enjoyed this film having never read the books because I love fantasy films, but it was a little on the childish side. It was more like Harry Potter than Lord of the Rings, so I guess I was expecting too much going in. It is worth seeing with younger kids, but I personally can't wait for King Kong.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="*Yawn*"></head><body><p>Firewall is one of those movies that you know what is going to happen before the opening credits start to roll.  Harrison Ford plays a security expert forced to break his unbreakable security system as a smarmy criminal (Paul Bettany) holds his wife (Virginia Madsen) and kids hostage.  It's familiar territory for Ford, but he plays it well like he usually does, while Bettany provides for a decent villain.  And that's just about all the good that Firewall does.  The film is a strictly by the numbers thriller that doesn't deliver on the thrills and opts instead for a safer route.  We never feel as if Ford's family is in any real peril, and by the time Ford comes to the inevitable conclusion to turn on the criminals, we know where things are headed and what will happen next.  Madsen, Robert Forster, and Robert Patrick all get wasted in roles that aren't worth their time; the only upside of which is that it's good to see each of them in a big budget flick.  All in all, Firewall is a typical, derivative, by the numbers movie that doesn't offer anything beyond it's glossy surface.</p></body></html>

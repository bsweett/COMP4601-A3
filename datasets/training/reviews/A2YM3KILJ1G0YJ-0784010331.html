It's also one of the overall best Arnold Schwarzenegger movies of all time.  It's so good that I can't possibly write a review comprehensive enough; I'll just honor Arnold and Total Recall as best I can.<br /><br />Arnold is married to Sharon Stone - at possibly her sexiest shortly before exploding onto the scene in Basic Instinct - but wants to go on vacation to Mars because of recurring dreams in which he cavorts with a mysterious and gorgeous brunette named Melina (Rachel Ticotin at her most delicious).  Instead, he goes to a company that does mind implants, providing retroactive vacations to various parts of the solar system.  It's just too bad that they interfere with previous government sponsored brainwashing.<br /><br />Eventually he learns that he was a former agent on Mars, gets a video from himself in the past in which he tells himself to remove a spherically shaped tracking device from his own nose, despite the fact that the device is three times the circumference of a nostril.  He also tells himself, "Git yo as* to Mahrs."<br /><br />It is on Mars where he sees the following: a mutant lady with three boobs, a knife and machine gun wielding midget hooker, oxygen-depletion that has led to horribly disfigured freaks, and a philosophical, prophetic, baby mutant that grows out of another man's chest, clearly inspired by Danny Devito in Arnold's previous movie Twins.<br /><br />And the great thing is he manages to see all of this as secret agents are chasing him and trying to kill him.  One memorable scene has Arnold on a crowded escalator where he uses some poor guy as a meatshield during a gun battle, tossing his carcass aside after it's served its purpose.  It's as bloody and gory as scenes come, and a signature of the explicitly violent and/or sexual content master Paul Verhoeven.<br /><br />With the mystery uncovered, and the bad guys defeated, one last bit of drama subsides as Arnold has to somehow use an alien device to unleash hell on the Mars atmosphere, delivering relief to all the planet's inhabitants.<br /><br />There are a ton of groin shots, perpetual single-bullet head shots, a decapitation, and a mechanical but realistic, removable, exploding fake face/head helmet thing.  I know it sounds unlikely, but you just have to trust me.  Of course, there are several classic Arnold one-liners.  For instance, just after he executes his former pseudo-wife, Arnold deadpans, "Consider dat a divohrce."  The best of all one-liners is when he kills someone with a drill and yells, "SCREW YOU!!"<br /><br />If you watch this and fail to find something interesting, then you simply don't like movies.</p></body></html>

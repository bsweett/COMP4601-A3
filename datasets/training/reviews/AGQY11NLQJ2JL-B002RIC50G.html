<meta name="summary" content="Great direction, production and performance, Gaspard Ulliel simply shines......."></head><body><p>I always wondered if Dr. Hannibal Lecter would be as fascinating and intriguing if not for Anthony Hopkins' performance in previous movies. Even As perfect as Hopkins' performance was, I think this great production of Hannibal rising rises to the same level of previous Hannibal movies and makes the book by Thomas Harris's a living novel.<br /><br />The evolution of Hannibal's evil is captured flawlessly through great music, direction, production and the outstanding performance of the cast, especially Gaspard Ulliel as young Hannibal and Gong Li as Lady Murasaki. It is amazing how the physical and emotional attraction between these two characters captured by the camera through their looks and body language. This view provided by the camera was more profound and telling than any possible dialogue.<br /><br />In spite of all the criticism that was directed at "Hannibal rising" when compared to Harris' original novel, I don't think that this movie could have been any better; highly recommended</p></body></html>

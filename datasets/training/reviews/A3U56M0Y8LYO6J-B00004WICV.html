It is undeniably a well-made film but one that is ultimately undone by a crucial deviation from the source material.<br /><br />Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is a prison guard in charge of overseeing inmates imprisoned on death row.  One day a new prisoner named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) arrives after being found guilty of killing two young girls.  Edgecomb wonders whether the imposing man really is guilty of the crime as he seems to be a harmless and gentle individual.  After Coffey displays a strange healing power, it becomes apparent that there is something wondrous about the man.<br /><br />Despite its technical excellence, "The Green Mile" has little in it to make it memorable.  The film flounders primarily because of the decision to replace the sobering ending in Stephen King's original work with an empty and inconsequential Hollywood finale.  In the novel, Edgecomb's character is subject to a traumatic experience that makes him question his actions in the prison.  The filmmakers completely abandoned this ending in order to produce a more generic product for the general public.  The story loses much of its weight because of this lack of soul-searching on Edgecomb's part.  The performances themselves are excellent although Hanks may have been a little too young for his character.  Duncan, Doug Hutchison, David Morse, Sam Rockwell, Barry Pepper, Harry Dean Stanton, Bonnie Hunt, William Sadler, James Cromwell, Gary Sinise, and Patricia Clarkson are all great but the film is still underwhelming despite their best efforts.</p></body></html>

Really intriguing concept, except for one thing: we've seen this before, and last time, it was called 28 Days Later - and it was a lot better than this cliche-ridden, horribly executed piece of mainstream, Hollywood trash. Once the CG "zombies" appeared, the entire movie went downhill from there. I went into this expecting something halfway decent. I guess I expected too much. Films like this are the reason that I avoid big Hollywood blockbusters. Ugh.</p></body></html>

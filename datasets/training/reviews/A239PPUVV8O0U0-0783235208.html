<meta name="summary" content="Death Is Only The Beginning"></head><body><p>Another favorite franchise of mine, the movies just never fail to deliver. In this, probably the "scariest" out of the three, we have the prologue that explains Imhotep's backstory and motivations then jump to Brendan Fraser's (another favorite actor of mine) character with the French Foreign Legion defending the City of the Dead in 1923 then jump another three years where we're introduced to Rachel Weisz's character and the rest of the story. A remake, and I use the term loosely, of the 1932 classic, so some story elements remain the same. Imhotep however gets an upgrade. From a walking corpse to his fully regenerated self, he possesses super-human abilities and can summon the ten plagues of Egypt. Fraser and Weisz have a chemistry together reminiscent, I think anyway, of Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg of The Avengers. John Hannah as Weisz's greedy brother Jonathan and Kevin J. O'Connor as Beni, O'Connell's cowardly "friend" are the comic relief in this but are nonetheless entertaining. Arnold Vosloo is great as Imhotep, ably conveying a sense of menace and tortured romance. A small bit part of a retired RAF Col., Bernard Fox (Dr. Bombay from Bewitched) is funny and charming when he talks about not going down in a blaze of glory like his comrades. The effects and action sequences are top-notch, the mummy effects being brilliantly done by ILM. Jerry Goldsmith delivers a great swashbuckling score that also manages to deliver, like Imhotep, a sense of menace.</p></body></html>

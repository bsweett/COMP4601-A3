<meta name="summary" content="Interesting And Fun - Tom Is Always Good!"></head><body><p>CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a very charming film directed by Stephen Spielberg (ET-The Extraterrestrial, Minority Report). It is a period piece and the detail to costumes and set design is very interesting and accurate. It made me wonder how much was actually special effects and how much was real. It's got humor sprinkled throughout and when you see what the ending tells you - you'll walk out of the theatre in amazement.<p>The story is that of 16 year-old played by Leonardo DiCaprio (Titanic, Gangs of New York) who cons his way into the airline business, medical field and in the Legal profession. His learns the scheming ways from his father who is brilliantly played by Christopher Walkin (The Dead Zone, America's Sweethearts). <p>Now, the FBI catches on to forged checks and sees a pattern develop and then assigns Tom Hanks (Apollo 13, Castaway, Splash) to try and track him down and incarcerate him<p>Spielberg directed this one with a little flair and a lot of attention to detail. It has humorous moments and a lot of interesting facets on the FBI, their procedures and what a clever boy can really do.<p>As a result of his worldly travels he ends up falling in love and the kicker of it all is the ending when you read the text on the screen that tells you what happened to these two men and what their doping today. I liked this movie - although a little long in length - it was much better than AI. This one is one I think the whole family can enjoy - if you can wait the length of the movie.

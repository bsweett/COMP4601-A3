The movie is straightforward and simple, almost quaintly so in an era where we've come to expect every movie to have a dramatic twist ending in which it turns out that an ancillary character (the best friend? the aging husband? the bitter wife?) was the actual mastermind behind everything. "Taken" has no such twists, partly because they've become a bit overdone in the movie industry, but mostly because such a twist would have undermined Neeson's hard-earned 'I told you so' as well as the (probably unintentional) movie subtext that pretty young women should never leave their fathers' homes - or for that matter the motherland.<br /><br />Indeed, it's difficult to say how much of the movie is meant to be a searing attack on women... Neeson's ex-wife palatably drips evil and malice, and his darling daughter is almost a caricature of the stereotypical spoiled brat - throwing a temper tantrum that would shame a three-year-old when Daddy doesn't instantly sign off on an exotic European getaway. When the daughter and girlfriend are kidnapped into white slavery for being imprudent enough to flirt with an attractive stranger on a busy street in a foreign country, the sexually active girl dies almost immediately and is never mentioned again in the film. Neeson's daughter, on the other hand, is a pure-as-the-driven-snow virgin, allowing him a crucial extra few hours to try to save her as she is shuttled off to the expensive and exclusive 'virgin auction'. Although I'm probably reading WAY too much into the movie with all this subtext - after all, this is supposed to be a fun, mindless shoot-em-up, not a dissertation on the evils of society.<br /><br />All tongue-in-cheek aside, "Taken" is a fine action movie if you're just looking for people to get blown up, shot, and run over by cars. Quite a few of the characters fail to act sensibly (like the slave-trader who is uncooperative for no reason at all except as a method to work in a torture scene), and some of the action feels a bit too pretentious - like a deliberate attempt to push the envelope. For example, when Neeson shots innocent people in order to get their loved ones to cooperate - the action doesn't make sense and simply doesn't fit the character, but we're out to push buttons here, not build a believable storyline. I recommend "Taken" for a fun, mindless action movie to pass the time, but I wouldn't waste too much time trying to find sense in it - this is a spectacle movie, not a philosophical one.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></body></html>

If you love watching something with an original spin on things, I really think this film has what you want. I mean, how often is it that you see a film where the aliens are the ones kept underneath the humans, treated like the lowest of the low, basically forced to live in their own filth? And that is just the setup to this really cool film. The actors are complete unknowns- and do a fantastic job, especially the lead. The movie itself, filmed quite inexpensively compared to just about anything nowadays, is filled with ridiculously awesome and realistic effects that makes Transformers 2 look like a video game.<br /><br />The reason I fell in love with District 9 is because this particular brand of Sci-Fi isn't just about effects and aliens and coverups. It actually has a plot, and a heart, so to speak. The humans you learn to despise and the aliens you completlely sympathize with. It's not a common occurance. I don't wish to give any of the plot away, so I will just say that the reason I did not give this film 5 stars is because of how it ended. I wasn't dissatisfied, per se, but I thought it a tad predictable, and is clearly screaming for a sequel. Either way though, District 9 is a great film, and certainly one of the better ones from 2009.</p></body></html>

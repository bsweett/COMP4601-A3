<meta name="summary" content="A ho-hum psychological thriller"></head><body><p>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a `true story' horror writer in the fact that he writes about haunted houses or places he visits. Never has he actually come across a ghost or even anything remotely haunting and it shows in his cynicism when people ask him questions or when people tell him about something that is haunted. One day while going through all the `come to my haunted place' mail he gets, he comes across a simple post card saying `Do Not Enter 1408', and it grabs his attention and he decides to try out the room. After some legal action, he finally gets his room booked and heads to the hotel. The manager of the hotel, Gerald Olin (Samuel Jackson), tries his best to convince Mike to not go into the room and to just take a penthouse suite and go to a Knicks game... anything but go in there. After some very convincing arguments from Gerald, Mike still goes in the room. Once in the room, Mike begins to witness some strange and scary events from a room that isn't just haunted, but more like evil and demonic. Mike is convinced he's just drugged from liquor that Gerald gave him and is hallucinating everything until things begin to hurt him.<br /><br />I really didn't care for this movie for the fact that, due to the trailers, I thought I was going to be watching a scary haunted room movie. But in fact it was more of a scary psychological thriller movie. That doesn't really bother me, but most of the scenes were just plain or not that interesting. There were a couple scenes that were really good, but there were just too many that made me wish the movie was over. I for one could have done without the daughter scenes, but that's only because I didn't know I was going into a `thinker' movie. Sure, I get the point that the room was bringing out his inner demons or whatever, but at the time, it was just out of place for me. And then the whole `is he in the room or is this in his head' and `did he escape or did he not' stuff was just not well thought out. If you wanted to leave it open for us for thinking, I don't think the ending should have been what it was. I heard there were two different ending though and I saw the one that was on the single disc DVD.<br /><br />I'll tell you what though; Samuel L. Jackson is a great actor. While he was trying to convince Mike to not go in that room, I was thinking, "DON'T GO IN THAT ROOM. LISTEN TO SAM! HE GOT ATE BY A SHARK! HE KNOWS THINGS!" The dialogue between John and Sam was really done well by both actors. I shouldn't really have to say much about John Cusack, he's awesome in everything he does. It's just his style that I really like. Like when Sam was hovering over John in a chair while telling a story, you see John look up and say "What are you doing?" It just felt like it wasn't scripted to me and I started giggling a little.<br /><br />Well in the end, I would say give it a try. These movies are seriously hit or miss for all different types of people. But to this guy, I really hated it both times I saw it.<br /><br />P.S. - My room was haunted when I was growing up! Seriously!</p></body></html>

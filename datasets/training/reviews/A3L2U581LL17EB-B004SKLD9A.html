<meta name="summary" content="A must see for anyone who enjoys sci-fi action."></head><body><p>P>Equilibrium features a terrific premise: the film is set sometime after WWIII (the year is unspecified) in a city called Libria, which is headed by a man called "Father" (Sean Pertwee), who only appears to the citizens via hologram.  All citizens are required to take a daily dose of prozium, a drug that dulls the emotions, which is what's believed to be the source of man's inhumanity to man.  To ensure people continue their dosage, examples are made by law enforcers called clerics.  These clerics are warrirors trained in a unique style called gun-kata, which teaches the fighter to stand in the position where they're least likely to be hit by enemy fire and to use a gun as an extension of the fighter itself.  In the opening scene, we see how such a concept works.<p>But similar to Logan's Run, our hero, cleric John Preston (Christian Bale), comes through an awakening when he misses his dose.  He experiences emotions for the first time and finds himself conflicted with everything he'd believed in and fought for and what he now believes is the right thing to do.  He wants to contact and join the rebel forces against "Father," but finds this isn't an easy task, especially with his new partner, Brandt (Taye Diggs), watching his every move and a massive army backing "Father."<p>Equilibrium is a film that can be viewed as thought-provoking entertainment.  Writer/director Kurt Wimmer conveys this emotionless world with great attention to minute details (I never noticed the cars were entirely white, even inside, until my second viewing), incredible sets and production values that display the sterile feel of the environment.  Whoever constructed the sets should be applauded, especially considering the modest budget the film had to work with.  The  look and feel of this city, along with Preston's erupting emotions, are nicely backed by Klaus Badelt's brooding score.<p>Simultaneously, the film has an utterly fabulous story, engrossing in its ability to convince you of this terrifying future and take you along for the ride beside our protagonist.  Are there plot holes?  Yes, but none that couldn't be reasonably explained, which means they're closer to being contrivances.  For instance, the soldiers Preston face obviously display some fear, but I think prozium is only a suppressant; it doesn't completely rid the person of emotions.  Plus, when someone has a shotgun pointed straight at his face, it'd be pretty difficult not to show some concern.<p>Much of what makes Equilibrium's story so suspenseful is it's unpredictability; Wimmer is so skillful in his delivery that it isn't until the conclusion we figure out the surprises and it's revealed who truly has the upper hand in this constantly twisting plot (possible spoiler: I will say this, I am quite glad the villains didn't turn out as dumb as they may have initially seemed).<p>Equilibrium's future claim to fame will be the gun-kata sequences, which are, for lack of a better word, breathtaking.  There are other terms I could use; innovative, exhilarating, exciting, thrilling, heart-pounding, but I think breathtaking most accurately captures the complete surprise and delight I felt while watching the film (on the big screen, no less).  There are five sequences that display gun-kata (along with two "ordinary" gun battles, a well-done sparring sequence, and some terrific swordplay), and each setpiece almost always tops the one that came before it in both innovation and excitment.  I hesitate to go further, as I feel your enjoyment will be heightened if you don't know exactly how the action plays out (suffice to say the one-on-one jaw-dropping climactic duel is, bar none, the best fight scene I've seen all decade long).  <p>Of course, as with almost all thrillers, action sequence only take up a minor portion of the running time (in this case, about twenty minutes in all, still a hefty amount, with a large portion of that in the climax).  So what keeps our attention to the screen isn't just the story, the stylish cinematography and production design, but also the performances.  At the center of the story is Christian Bale, an always superb actor who delivers one of his best performances as Preston.  This immensely difficult role is made entirely believable and moving by Bale, whose captivating turn ensures we have a rooting interest from beginning to end.<p>Taye Diggs doesn't get the opportunity to shine nearly as much as Bale, but is solid as Brandt, though his constant smiling has been a source of complaint.  (spoiler) By the end of the film, it's still questionable whether or not he was taking prozium. He is Dupont's underling, which suggests he, too, might not have been taking his prozium.  Emily Watson is good, though underused, as Mary O'Brien, a woman Preston takes interest in.  William Fichtner has an intriguing role as a somewhat mysterious but passionate rebel leader and Angus Mcfadyen is suitably chilling as the head cleric Dupont.<p>Equilibrium's action sequences have raised the bar for future competition, and not even the just released The Matrix Reloaded can compete (not that their action is similar) with what Wimmer has crafted.  But just as important, the movie engages our mind, our emotions, and pulls us through all 107 minutes without a hiccup in pacing or momentum.</p></body></html>

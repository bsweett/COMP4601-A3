<meta name="summary" content="Good But Not Groundbreaking"></head><body><p>Since this film was first released it's had nothing but rave reviews from most professional critics and Amazon critics alike. This is certainly a good film that has its entertaining moments and is quite memorable; however, it's nothing groundbreaking and certainly not a film that's worthy of 5 star status.<br />Remy is a sewer rat who's told by his family and friends that he must live off scraps of any food he can find. His family and friends can live this way without a problem, but Remy has a problem, he has an excelled sense of smell which means he can't bare to try the scraps that he's taught he must eat to survive. Remy, against the wishes of his Father, Remy endeavours to find new flavours by smelling and mixing different foods, but to do this he must enter the humans territory. He constantly enters the home of an elderly woman to borrow some flavourings, On his numerous trips there he reads a recipe book by a nationally famous French Chef, Gusteau. Gusteau inspires Remy to keep trying new mixtures of flavourings and ingredients. During one of his regular trips to the humans home, Remy brings his brother along and the woman wakes up to spot the rats rummaging through her cupboards. She brings out a gun and starts shooting at them both, which leads to her ceiling collapsing revealing hundred of rats who have been living in her attic. While all the rats are running, Remy is left behind and goes the wrong way down a sewer which leads him to Paris, right outside Gusteau's restaurant.<br />Gusteau's restaurant is in trouble as due to a recent negative review from a really tough critic the restaurant is bumped from 5 stars down to 3 which leads to the death of Gusteau. Remy finds himself in the kitchen of Gusteau's fixing a soup that was accidentally ruined by the Garbage Boy Linguini who's the nephew of Gusteau. The soup becomes a success and Linguini takes the credit as the minute Remy was spotted he was taken away by Linguini to prevent him being killed. They form an unlikely bond that leads them down a slippery slope filled with comedy, love and revenge.<br /><br />Now, like I said this film is a pretty good movie but it's nowhere nears the greatness that it's been described as by many critics. To be honest it's the typical Disney plot line sugar coated in a new story and new characters; to some this may be fine and you may still enjoy the whole "facing tragedy we all come together and make it work" story, but quite frankly I'm finding it dull. Unlike others I didn't buy this right away as I knew what to expect, I knew I would only get a new storyline, but before I'd even bought it I had worked out the ending. I love the Disney/Pixar films and I'm a big fan of The Incredibles, Cars and Monsters Inc. But this film, I just didn't see the magic that I felt from the three aforementioned movies.<br /><br />My little niece watched this film with me, and naturally she loved it, but I felt robbed. I know it's a kids movie, but I still expected to like this film as much as I did the other 3 Disney/Pixar movies especially considering how good some of the reviews were.<br />If you're thinking of buying this for a young relative then I would highly recommend it, but if you're looking for an innocent film that's going to recapture the magic of any previous Disney/Pixar collaborations than this is something that you should stay away from</p></body></html>

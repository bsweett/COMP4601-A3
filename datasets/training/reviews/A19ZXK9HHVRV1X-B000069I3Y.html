While millions of people around the world are commemorating the crucifixion and atonement of Jesus Christ, Banek and Gibson find themselves acting out a little morality play of their own in the streets and skyscrapers of downtown Manhattan.  Along the way, they too will confront the issues of right and wrong, sin and redemption - and find out just how far into the depths of depravity their own moral codes will allow them to go.  Interestingly, the heightened unreality of some of the characters' more extreme actions brings to the tale much of the quality of a parable.  As a result, we don't have to believe every twist and turn of the plot in order to validate and appreciate it.<p>As the title of the film suggests, the theme revolves around what happens when the paths of two very distinct lives "accidentally" intersect.  These two individuals are total strangers before fate, chance, providence, the gods - whatever you want to call it - conspire to bring them together.  Banek is a hotshot young attorney who has married into his father-in-law's wealthy firm, while Gibson is a recovering alcoholic and AA member who is trying desperately to close the deal on a house so that his fed-up wife won't move with their boys to Oregon, far away from Gibson's deleterious influence.  Both desperate to get to their respective court dates - Banek to argue an important case and Gibson to plead for one more chance to keep his family from moving away - the two harried men meet up in a mild fender bender during morning rush hour traffic.  When Banek callously palms Gibson off with a blank check and leaves him stuck in traffic to fend for himself, the wheels are set in motion for the strange, offbeat tale of revenge and recrimination that ensues.  In the confusion of the accident, Banek does not realize that he has accidentally left a crucial folder in Gibson's possession.  Gibson, mistreated by Banek at the scene of the accident and refused a hearing by the court because of his tardiness, finds himself in no mood to turn the other cheek and help Banek by returning his folder.  The resultant game of cat-and-mouse, which could so easily have devolved into a cheap, tawdry melodrama of violence and revenge, instead achieves surprising moments of thought provoking depth and insight.<p>"Changing Lanes" is, indeed, that rarity among American films: a drama more concerned with issues and ideas than with cheap thrills and emotional exploitation.  Within the context of a densely plotted thriller, writer Chap Taylor has fashioned a film that is nothing less than a study of the part ethics plays in our daily lives.  Like all of us, Banek and Gibson contain within their beings both the seeds of goodness and the germs of evil.  The question becomes how far each is willing to go to cultivate those qualities when faced with the dilemmas and vicissitudes life throws their way.  Both men, though basically decent at the core, find themselves doing deeds that surprise even themselves when pushed into a corner by despair and desperation.  Rarely in the movies do we find characters this concerned with analyzing both the motives and the consequences of their actions.  In fact the film plays out like a classic morality play, with each man engaging in an internal struggle with his conscience as well as with the other person.  The underlying cynical subtext is, of course, that, in the corporate business world, all morality is relative, a fact Banek, in particular, is ultimately forced to face up to - and, by extension, to act upon.<p>Although it does seem to strain a bit to make its point every now and then - employing overemphasis when subtlety is what is really called for - the film boasts a number of beautiful and haunting moments such as when the director, Roger Michell, intercuts between a quiet, but highly charged and revelatory conversation Gibson has with his longsuffering wife and a scene of Banek seeking surcease from his guilt in a quiet confessional. <p>Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson both do superb work at getting to the bottom of their respective characters' innermost feelings and thoughts.  David Arnold's somber musical score and Salvatore Totino's moody cinematography lend an appropriately otherworldly quality to this stark morality play, making the everyday world of city streets and soaring skyscrapers seem strangely twisted and menacing.  <p>"Changing Lanes" does lose its nerve a little at the end, as evidenced by a certain softness in its resolution. Nevertheless, it still deserves enormous credit for attempting to do what few other films even have the courage to try.  It's truly refreshing to see a film that respects the intelligence of its audience and which provides moviegoers with a little nutritional sustenance to go along with all that cinematic junk food Hollywood normally provides for us in such abundance.</p></body></html>

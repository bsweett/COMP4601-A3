<meta name="summary" content="Once more up Jacob's Ladder"></head><body><p>You know Adrien Brody's Gulf War veteran is in a bad way in The Jacket not just because he's been shot in the head and sent to Kris Kristofferson's asylum for the criminally insane for a murder he didn't commit, but because Jennifer Jason Leigh is the most normal member of staff there. In that context, being pumped full of drugs, put in a straitjacket and left in a morgue drawer that allows him to project himself into the future to unravel the mystery of is imminent death seems almost straightforward. Yes, we're in Jacob's Ladder territory here (once upon a time it even had the same ending) without ever approaching that film's complexity or emotional power. The result is not so much bad as okay. Brody and Daniel Craig are fine, but the gimmick casting of Keira Knightley in the kind of damaged goods part that Leigh used to be able to do in her sleep doesn't really work. While it's the closest she's give to a decent performance yet, it's still all surface affectations - some of them good - but no substance, which takes away from the heart the film both wants and needs. Mildly satisfying but not outstanding.<br /><br />The extras package is small but good, with the deleted scenes and alternate endings put into perspective by the acompanying documentary.</p></body></html>

When confronted, he's practically a superhero who can take on anybody and any amount of attackers. He's carrying around a Bible which is supposed to represent "hope" in this lawless, wasteland of a world. Gary Oldman, on the othe hand, is a power hungry villain who recognizes that the Bible would be an excellent tool in suppressing others, creating fear and justifying existing turmoil. He wants Denzel's Bible.<br /><br />There's two ways to evaluate this loathsome movie.<br /><br />1) As pure entertainment, it's terrible. The movie is, for the most part boring, the combat sequences are overstylish and the plot has no resolution, as though they did not where to go with this. The charactors, dialogue, and themes are preposterous.<br /><br />2) In taking this as a serious metaphor for religion, it's even worse. While I'm not a big fan of organized religion, it can be argued that if this movie was supposed to be a proponent of organized religion, it seriously backfires. This movie paints the use of the Bible in mostly evil terms. Gary Oldman practically spews the Marxian view that "religion is the opium of the masses" in explaining why the Bible would be so powerful in his hands. Even the Denzel Washington charactor, who is supposed to be righteous with his  intentions for his Bible, really does not act as that much of a hero within the film.<br /><br />There's brutality and violence that does not justify a purpose, charactor development on people that end up not being worthy of the development and a ridiculous conclusion.<br /><br />This movie came out around the same time as "The Road", another overly dark, post apocolyptic film. That film, if the "end of the world cinema" is your thing, is far superior since it's more bleak, in a realistic manner and, in a horrifying portayal, examines the mass chaos when a society is broken down (although it a well made film, it puzzles me who would get an entertainment value out of such a really sad and depressing film).<br /><br />If this movie did not have the charismatic Denzel Washington in it, it would not even be worth watching on cable.<br /><br />I would think that the only person that could enjoy this would be either an ardent aethiest or religous zealot.</p></body></html>

Maybe the opposite, if you focus on a wedgied eighth grade. But I'd give anything to be this way-awesome master of way-awesome beatdown skills (on all those guys who beat me down, at least), as long as it isn't too hard. Heck, I'd take a fair beating too - not like I haven't done it before - as long as the cool guys let me hang with them.<br /><br />If you're still with me, then KFP is your ultimate fantasy. The golden goal is to find that unique power that each of us has within. Yeah, and everybody wins the race and gets a hug at the end. But maybe, just maybe, that one thing about you really can stand tall in some squirrely place in the world. Then, you are Po. Po Panda.<br /><br />Perhaps there's a reference here to Li Po, the classic drunken poet - perhaps not. I really don't care. It's just a fun flick with lots of satire on the traditional "work hard forever" themes that don't work so well in the current decade. Po is the guy you really want to like, even if he's ... well, y'know, not so hard-working.<br /><br />The animation matches the best of today's, and voice casting backs up the animated characters as well as any. My one kvetch, and little, is that Angelina Jolie's voice was way too smooth for Master Tigress. My ears just kept looking for a rocky rasp that her honeyed soprano never delivered. My problem, not yours, not hers.<br /><br />As long as you don't take the martial arts too seriously, this is a charming and humorous riff on taking them seriously. See it and laugh at it. If you can be polite about all the rest, it's warm fuzzy fun.<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></body></html>

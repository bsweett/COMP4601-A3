<meta name="summary" content="Where's"Amazon Prime" When you need him?"></head><body><p>I ordered this DVD when it first came out, but have just now got around to reviewing it. When I bought it I decided to become a member of "Amazon Prime" mostly because I wanted to tell my friends "I bought Optimus Prime via Amazon Prime" (Don't ask)<br />After the novelty of telling my friends this had worn off, reality started sinking in. Mostly because I still hadn't received it. Even though Amazon Prime promises free 2 day delivery, it had been 3 days and no DVD. I called customer service about this, and they told me the 2 days was just an estimate. Apparently the company gets away with this because in the fine print it tells you that it's just an estimate. On day 4 my friends started teasing me because I didn't have the DVD even after bragging to everyone about it. It finally came on day 6 (day 5 was a sunday) but by that time nobody liked transformers any longer, children are fickle I guess. That hasn't stopped the local kids from calling me "Two-Day" as an insult however. Thanks a lot Amazon, Your Amazon Prime is an Amazon Crime!</p></body></html>

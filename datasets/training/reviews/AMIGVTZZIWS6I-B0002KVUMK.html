<meta name="summary" content="Mediocre Creature Feature"></head><body><p>This movie is like a throwback to Universals 1950s creature features.  While I understand that it's meant to be an homage to those films, this just doesn't do it for me.  Granted the special effects are very good, but the plot is thin and the story kind of jumbled up.  Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale are very good, but both are capable of so much more.  As horror flicks go, it's good, but don't expect to see anything knew or exciting in this film.</p></body></html>

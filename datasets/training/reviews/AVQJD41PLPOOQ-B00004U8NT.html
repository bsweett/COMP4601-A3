<meta name="summary" content="Still Spielberg's best film!"></head><body><p>No doubt, legendary director Steven Spielberg will best be remembered for E.T. and SCHINDLER'S LIST.  This UFO classic will always remain my favorite.  The director's edition restores some scenes that were omitted when the special edition was released in 1980, and deletes the "inside the mother ship" scene, which I always felt was overkill.<br /><br />On a more personal note...in the days following September 11, 2001, this was the film I finally came upon on TV after all those horrifying hours of 9-11 images.  As I watched, I was suddenly 10 years-old again, seeing the movie for the first time at the Ziegfeld Theater in NYC.  It didn't seem to matter that I had the uncut, unedited VHS tape on the shelf in front of me, I just kept watching it to the end.<br /><br />Thank you, Mr. Spielberg, for being the only evidence of any real magic in this world.</p></body></html>

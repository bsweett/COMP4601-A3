<meta name="summary" content="Strange Cast Never Gets Off on the Right Foot"></head><body><p>On the surface this sounds like an awkward concept with extremely questionable casting, and in execution it's exactly that. I'll admire the guts it took to look at this from a totally different perspective and cast Seth Rogen as the lead, but he really doesn't step up his game to match the opportunity. His character is a complete jerk, an unlikeable doofus I couldn't pull for in the even simplest melodramatic setup, and Rogen's constant pursuit of the perfect mistimed joke only adds fuel to the fire. Of course, it doesn't help matters that the movie itself is an incomprehensible mess, constantly straddling the line between reality and exaggeration, without a tangible player in the hunt. Director Michel Gondry brings a grand total of three surreal, dreamy, inspired scenes to the table and sleepwalks through the rest of the process, which is a major disappointment. An irritatingly generic action dump with neither an emotional connection to the audience nor a tangible hold on reality. In short, a total waste of time.</p></body></html>

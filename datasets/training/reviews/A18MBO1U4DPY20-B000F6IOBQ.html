My major concern was the lack of a concrete storyline, haphazard direction, predictability and lack of surprise the film offers. Relax, I'm not the first person who ever watched a film without watching the prequel. I don't know if I should complain on the acting front cause it was decent. I quite liked the villain's character but there was not much this film offered with a thin plot.<br /><br />I'll name two better films, Poseidon and King Arthur<br /><br />Underworld : Evolution was definitely better than Van Helsing though.<br /><br />Almost nothing about this film is extraordinary or remotely unique</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One Of Kilmer's Best Performan"></head><body><p>Secret Serviceman extra-ordinnaire Val Kilmer tries to retrieve a kidnapped politician's daughter in this surprisingly-good thriller.<br /><br />There isn't a lot of violence in this modern day tough rescue story, but when it occurs, look out! Kilmer is very good in here, one of his best performances ever and the film is nicely photographed. The only warning I would give viewers is the language, which contains about 25 f-words.<br /><br />The best plug I can give this film is that it was very entertaining, start to finish, and that's what most of us are looking for - entertainment. It keeps your attention the full 100-plus minutes. Make no mistake: Kilmer is the show. Everything in the story really revolves around him.<br /><br />There was anything that struck a sour note with me, it would be the story with the kidnapped girl's father. I don't think he was realistic, but I won't say more in fear of spoiling anything for those who haven't seen this.<br /><br />Nonetheless, an under-publicized excellent film of 2004.</p></body></html>

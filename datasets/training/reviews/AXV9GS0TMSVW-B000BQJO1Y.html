<meta name="summary" content="Best of the Dead"></head><body><p>George Romero can rest assured that his zombie classic will not become dated over time, despite advances in special effects, cinematography, and makeup because Dawn of the Dead is in a league of its own in terms of story, characterization, themes, and overall ambience.<br /><br />The success of Romero's "Dead" films lies in an often duplicated trait of horror films: isolation.  It's something that Romero has mastered to a tee.  While seemingly simple, the concept of keeping the characters in an abandoned shopping mall with a bunch of zombies creates a slight fear among its viewers, whether your watching it at home or in a theater.  It's been repeated time and again, but Romero's ability to isolate his characters is a hallmark of his films.<br /><br />Romero's characters are also more complex than those in a basic horror film.  While traditional horror films have characters suffer from pure stupidity, Romero is more interested in human instincts and characters succumbing to their own vices or even their own primal urges.  This is found in the way the survivors decide to not only explore, but get more than they need in the shopping mall.<br /><br />Besides being a wonderful horror film, however, it's so much more, as other viewers have noted.  I think no other horror film addresses the concept of consumerism, down to the point of comparing shoppers to zombies.  The film's finale is riddled with irony - and you might even be granted a smirk here and there.<br /><br />As for its timelessness, beyond the film's themes, Romero has created a film that, even if effects don't date well (and they actually do pretty well, especially for the time, gotta love Savini),  feels terrifying.  I think being trapped in a store is one of those nightmares everyone has.  This film may be the reason why.</p></body></html>

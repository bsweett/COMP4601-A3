Over 100 years later, the case has never been solved, though there are plenty who claim to know who the real killer is. Enter the Hughes Brothers and their adaption of the popular graphic novel, From Hell. As a movie, it is intelligent and well made, with strong performances and plenty of twists. <p>Johnny Depp gives on of his most memorable performances as Inspector Abberline, who in real life was assigned to the Ripper murders and retired having never solved the case. He is a drug-addicted police inspector who has a reputation for solving crimes through his clairvoyance. His abilities and loyalties are put to the test when prostitutes in Whitechaple, a slum of London, are murdered most foul by the Ripper. The story is nothing new, but new life is breathed into it by the Hughes Brothers artful direction and Rafael Yglesias's colorful screenplay. Also giving stellar performances are Robbie Coltrane as Abberlines intellectual partner, and Ian Holm as the doctor assisting in the investigation. Less than stellar is Heather Graham, though, and her presence as Mary Kelly (one of the victims) and the contrived love story that ensues is the one Achilles heel in this movie. <p>With 2 editions of this DVD out now, the 2-disc set is the one to go with. The well put together &quot;Jack the Ripper: Six Degrees of Separation&quot; is an examination on the murders, the suspects, and the investigation. But the best of all featurettes is actually a hidden easter egg. Highlight &quot;Absinthe makes the heart grow fonder&quot; on Disc 2, and quickly press down and right. You'll see a surgical tool highlighted and it will take you to a 40 minute documentary called &quot;Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution&quot; (snippets of which are seen in the interactive parts of the first featurette). This was produced in 1980 and features an interview with author Stephen Knight, who wrote the book on which the graphic novel, and this movie, is based. It is a fascinating documentary, and one that sketches broad strokes on the killings and the conspiracy that covered them. The other good featurette is the aformentioned &quot;Absinthe makes the heart grow fonder&quot;, which is a breif lesson on the history of the notorious drink, and it's impact on culture and art. Skippable is the horrible Heather Graham-hosted &quot;A View From Hell&quot;, which is a retread of well-known facts. Perhaps good for one or two viewings is the Hughes Brother's &quot;Tour of Murder Sites&quot;, where they walk you around the From Hell set is Prauge. It would have prefered a tour of the actual murder sites. <p>A lot of people didn't like this movie, calling it a glorified slasher movie. While the violence is plentiful, the intelligence of the script and the style if directon make this distinction unfair. It is a great movie, and the 2 DVD treatment will provide you with hours of entertainment, as well as a history lesson on the Jack the Ripper case.</p></body></html>

Set around the year 1939, the story creates a highly fictitious world that is seemingly free of Nazis in Germany (they are certainly never mentioned), but does mention fighting in Asia, though Japan is never directly mentioned as being involved.  Instead, in this near-utopian vision of 1939, passengers travel from Europe to New York aboard a dirigible named the "Hindenburg III" that lands by attaching itself to the never-used airship landing cone on top of the Empire State Building.  (In this idealized setting, passengers disembark the airship via a long stairs over 100 floors above the streets below with no concern about winds that could easily blow the airship--and them--into a very precarious position.)  The film then focuses upon the first of its three principal characters: a newspaper reporter by the name of Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow), who becomes interested in the disappearance of six noted scientists around the globe.  All of them had worked together on a secret German project before WWI, but only one of the original seven was still free: Dr. Jennings (Trevor Baxter).  Polly meets Dr. Jennings at a theater playing "The Wizard of Oz", but everyone is interrupted by an onslaught of giant, flying robots that attack New York; to which, a panicked radio operator sends an immediate plea for help to the film's second principal character known as Sky Captain (Jude Law).  He rushes to New York in his highly advanced British Spitfire and eventually comes across Polly, who had previously dated him.  Once the giant robot threat subsides, Sky Captain and Polly travel to his secret airbase where is faithful and highly inventive assistant, Dex (Giovanni Ribisi), has been studying the robots; but their arrival is interrupted by another robotic attack, which is lead by a mysterious woman (Ling Bai).  Being very resourceful, Dex is able to determine that the robots are being controlled from somewhere in Shangri-La.  To have enough fuel to reach Shangri-La, Sky Captain and Polly are assisted by the film's third principal character: an officer in the British Royal Air Force, Franky (Angelina Jolie), that commands the equivalent of a flying aircraft carrier.  It is up to them to find out who is controlling the robots and what his fiendish plot may be.<br /><br />"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" may be the first film to have been shot almost entirely in front of blue screens because aside from the human actors, everything else is computer-generated graphics.  The robots, flapping-wing planes, flying aircraft carriers and planes that can travel underwater are all very impressive special effects, but visual effects alone cannot define the overall quality of a film, especially when the story (which is set in a fictitious representation of the past) feels dated from the get-go and too unrealistic to fully engage an audience.  Had this film been produced in the late 1930's (of course, without the aid of computer graphics), the story would have probably been similar to the early Buck Rogers serials of the period and probably had been better received by an audience unfamiliar with today's technological advancements.  However, creating such a film today, though visually impressive, simply fell short of what a most people in a twenty-first century audience expect.  Consequently, my overall rating for "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is 3 out of 5 stars.  Clearly, Kerry Conran is a highly creative individual and I expect to see more visually impressive films from him in the future.</p></body></html>

He directs, writes, and acts as the film's main protagonist in Garden State, a film with flashes of near brilliance.  He is no doubt worth looking out for and deserves quite a bit of credit.  However, Garden State should be judged as a film without taking that into account and although it does contain some genuinely sweet moments and some even better moments of natural humor, it just isn't consistent in how compelling it was for me.  I'm sure that experience will be different for everyone but to me it contains some very unlikely and unnatural moments.<br /><br />Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is a quasi-actor and full fledge waiter who returns to his hometown for his mother's funeral.  He stops taking his medication (he was on zoloft, depakote, and lithium among many others) and begins to awaken a little bit.  He meets old friends and reflects on his family life before he left his hometown.  He then meets a new friend named Sam (Natalie Portman) who helps him realize what is really important to him.  Although clich&eacute;, the film's end is satisfying and I can't pinpoint why but I really didn't expect it from a character I didn't like very much in Largeman.<br /><br />I want to believe that Garden State is semi-biographical for Braff, and it probably is (I might write a movie where I fall in love with Natalie Portman too) but if there are scenes influenced by reality, then it seems very simple to see which ones are and which ones are completely exaggerated for the sake of comedic storytelling.  The other thing that troubled me about Garden State was how selfish every character is.  It makes it very difficult to care about characters that you wouldn't have any respect for in real life.  The only exception to this Portman's Sam who is very likeable and quirky but is probably the only character that isn't based on some degree of reality.  I don't see any real serious undertones in Garden State or any real commentary beyond reflecting some aspect of real life.  It failed to do that for me and that's probably why it comes off as pretentious.  In some ways it really is only a few steps above pure teenage comedies because it wants to be adult so bad at times and maybe that is a strength for some people, but to me the way it masks its comedic goals with unconvincing drama is almost unforgivable.<br /><br />Garden State is in the frame of a very good movie and for the most part I didn't think it was as bad as I'm detailing here, I think I just couldn't identify with it.  Performances from Portman, Braff, Ian Holm, Peter Saargard and others are genuine, at times amusing, and overall pretty solid.  The actors do struggle at times with the more ostentatious and less believable dialogue. Portman is especially enjoyable to watch but you really wonder how long she can be the potentially great actress everyone has been waiting for.  Despite what some people may suggest, this movie is not the vehicle for Portman's career defining star moment, which may or may not ever come.  She probably doesn't care though and is fine slumming it in quirky little films like this that have very little to say.  Anyway, it is worth watching if you like the talent in this movie.  It shows some budding talent from Braff and some solid actors at work. It also happens to have a smart sense of humor that I suppose I appreciated.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002J58LK">soundtrack</a> was great but also felt pretty consistent with Braff's hipster-wannabe motif.  Either way, I'll keep an eye out for his next movie.</p></body></html>

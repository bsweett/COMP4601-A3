Director Doug Liman who did "Swingers" in 1996 & "Go" in 1999 accomplishes that with flying colors.  Tony Gilroy who was the screenwriter for "Devil's Advocate" and "Dolores Claiborne" works with W. Blake Herron to produce a screenplay that takes Ludlum's novel as a starting point.  The film is fast paced, moves quickly, is gorgeously photographed on location in Prague and Paris, and is a handsome DVD package to add to your collection.  Matt Damon as Jason Bourne surprises us with his action ability while showing the perplexity of someone suffering from amnesia, thrown in an ever-changing situation where his past literally threatens his every moment.  Chris Cooper who just won the best supporting actor Oscar for "Adaptation" and has played increasingly interesting roles in "Horse Whisperer," "October Sky," & "American Beauty," does an excellent job as the manager of a secret program called Treadstone that networks assassins worldwide.  He becomes increasingly agitated until his assassination clears the way for Jason's ultimate freedom.  Franka Potente who played Johnny Depp's girlfriend in "Blow" and is a major German filmstar does a great job as the gypsy-like Maria who is enlisted by Bourne and becomes his willing accomplice.  Clive Owen who was so noticeable in "Gosford Park" doesn't have a lot of lines, but has one of the film's most memorable moments in his death scene in the wheatfield.  Julia Stiles isn't asked to do much, but is interesting in her supporting role as Nicolette who runs Treadstone's Paris office.  This is a film like a roller coaster.  The DVD's deleted scenes are interesting with the one with the psychologist being one I felt could have easily added to the film.  The alternate ending lead me to believe the director picked the right one, but was interesting to view.  I never was absolutely clear on why the agency insisted on Bourne's assassination.  This is a great rainy-day film that I'm pleased to have in my collection.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

What starts off as innocent fun quickly turns into extreme violence and severe swearing.  They say the F word a couple times, and there was one violent moment in particular that made me sick showing a soldier bashing a guys face in (including close-up shots of blood pouring from his face).  It was the biggest surprise of the plot, and I mean that in a BAD way.<br /><br />It's supposed to be a film about fairy tales.  The war storyline is what I originally thought to be a creation as a way for children to look away from the real-life nonstop violence and find a happy place in the land of fairy tales.  Unfortunately the fantasy land the little girl in this movie explores is filled with lots of blood and a twisted, disgusting atmosphere. The war story may be unrelated to the fantasy segments, but both stories are really violent and inappropriate for children.<br /><br />Some of the monsters in this game reminded me of those in video games such as Silent Hill and Resident Evil 2.  Probably a coincidence.  Especially that one monster sitting at a dinner table who didn't like it when the girl ate some grapes off the table and then proceeded to run after her.  He had eyes in his hands, just like that big monster in Resident Evil 2 had eyes in his arms.<br /><br />Adults who like war movies won't find enough detail to keep them interested, and children who like fantasy elements will probably be too disgusted to really find the courage to watch Pan's Labyrinth all the way through without getting nightmares.  I have no idea what kind of person this movie was intended for.</p></body></html>

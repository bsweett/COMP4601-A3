<meta name="summary" content="Lovecraft smiles in his grave"></head><body><p>Frank Darabont's "The Mist" would have made Howard Phillips Lovecraft proud, even if he would have had to leave the house to watch it.<br /><br />Bank on it: when you see a Stephen King film that does NOT INVOLVE direction by Stephen King and the material is excellent in the first place, you're in for a terrifying ride: ("Salem's Lot", "Pet Cemetery", "The Shining" all attest to this) this film is a case in point.  Thomas Jane gives the same performance he always does but it works as the befuddled, terrified and courageous Everyman David Drayton<br />makes a simple decision with tremendous consequences: he goes to the grocery store.<br /><br />The sheer mystery and grotesque nature of what goes on is convincing by virtue of the relatively banal, provincial setting: relations between annoying townsfolk and the "artist" (Drayton) escalate when the fantastic is finally introduced into their own lives.  The scene in which the teenage boy makes an unwise decision to be a tough guy in front of the other locals lets you know what you're in for.  Andre Braugher is in this movie for about five seconds and I have no idea why: he's such a great actor and I would have been curious as to how his character would have dealt with the situation if he hadn't denied it was happening, or thought it was an "inside joke" being played by the locals.  Scarier than the things outside, though, is the religious fanatic played by Marcia Gay Harden, known as Mrs. Carmody to anyone who even skimmed the novella: the ultimate bad religious, the most irritating and horrifying phenomena in perhaps the entire tale, she takes full advantage of the situation to impose her blasphemous view of the Old Testament on the dumbstruck crowd, turning them into bloodthirsty monsters.  When the young marine is offered up to the looming horror outside as "Food for the Gods", one can barely watch.<br /><br />But the ending: this is key here.  You will never see it coming and it is absolutely perfect.  Great!</p></body></html>

This is not a bold statement. He's a natural, and has that innate ability to evoke emotion from his audience.<br /><br />Denzil won the Oscar for Best Actor in 2002 for his role in Training Day. I have not seen the film in years and it presented itself the other day, reminding me that actors like Ethan Hawke & Denzil Washington, when working with a good script, (author, David Ayer) can do wonders...and both artists' certainly rose to this particular occasion, making Training Day a memorable film.<br /><br />Personally, when not reading for study or research, good thrillers and detective stories are my genre of choice; Training Day from the start pulled me in as we do not know how "bad" Alonzo (Washington) really is...but he's bad to the bone!<br /><br />Training Day is not your usual plot for this genre.<br /><br />Training Day is a well crafted film, authentic L.A. locations, great soundtrack, and Director Antoine Fuqua along with the spot on editing of Conrad Buff and excellent soundtrack (original) Mark Mancina along with the original song by Tobin Asperence, "Last Resort", only adds to the films production value and class.<br /><br />But films like Training Day are the films that attempt to reveal "reality" in its based form and accomplishes it.<br /><br />Seeing Training Day again after many years shows me that the attempt to suspend disbelief, particularly pushing for genuine "reality" in film, with a good script and great actors, is hard to beat.<br /><br />Training Day is one such film.</p></body></html>

This is how the story goes: In an alternate 1985 America, costumed superheroes are part of the fabric of everyday society, and the "Doomsday Clock" - which charts the USA's tension with the Soviet Union - is permanently set at five minutes to midnight. When one of his former colleagues is murdered, the washed-up but no less determined masked vigilante Rorschach sets out to uncover a plot to kill and discredit all past and present superheroes. As he reconnects with his former crime-fighting legion - a ragtag group of retired superheroes, only one of whom has true powers - Rorschach glimpses a wide-ranging and disturbing conspiracy with links to their shared past and catastrophic consequences for the future. Their mission is to watch over humanity...but who is watching the watchmen?<br /><br />The cast led by Malin Akerman (as Laurie Jupiter / Silk Spectre II), Billy Crudup (as Dr. Manhattan / Jon Osterman), Matthew Goode (as Adrian Veidt / Ozymandias), Jackie Earle Haley (as Walter Kovacs / Rorschach), Jeffrey Dean Morgan (as Edward Blake / The Comedian), & Patrick Wilson (as Dan Dreiberg / Nite Owl II) is excellent! The directing by Zack Snyder (who also directed "300" (2007, also co-wrote the screenplay) & "Dawn Of The Dead" (2004), he also writing the story and screenplay and directing the upcoming "Sucker Punch" (2010) is excellent!

The cinematography by Larry Fong (who also did the cinematography to "300") is excellent!

The casting by Kristy Carlson (who is also doing the casting to the upcoming "Sucker Punch") is excellent! The production design by Alex McDowell (who also did the production design to the upcoming "Fantastic Mr. Fox" (2009), he also did the production design to "Bee Movie" (2007), "Tim Burton's Corpse Bride" (2005), "Charlie And The Chocolate Factory" (2005), "The Terminal" (2004), "The Cat In The Hat" (2003), "Minority Report" (2002), "Fight Club" (1999), & "The Crow" (1994) is excellent!

The costume design by Michael Wilkinson (who also did the costume design to "300", "Babel" (2006), & the upcoming "Terminator: Salvation" (2009) is excellent!<br /><br />This is an excellent action-packed film that packs a wallop. This is smart, interesting, and slick. This is one of the best films of the new year, thus far.</p></body></html>

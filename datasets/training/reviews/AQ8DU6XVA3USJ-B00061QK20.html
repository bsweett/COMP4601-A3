Yinzheng's desire to conquer his six neighboring provinces and unify the country led to years of bloodshed, and in this film, there are 2 men and a woman, who are mentally powerful enough and adept in their fighting skills to go against him. Jet Li is marvelous as the Nameless one, and Maggie Cheung gorgeous as Flying Snow, but it is Tony Leung ("Chungking Express") who shines above all. A man who exudes strength and beauty in many of its forms, he is fantastic as Broken Sword. Also excellent are Chen Dao Ming as the Yinzheng, Zhang Ziyi as Moon, and Donnie Yen as Sky.<br /><br />For director/writer/producer Zhang Yimou, a master of dramas like "Raise the Red Lantern, " this was his first endeavor in the action genre, and he creates scenes that seem as though they are being sculpted, with flowing curtains and walls that tumble with ethereal grace. Christopher Doyle's cinematography of vast panoramas is a feast for the eyes, and added to this scenic banquet is a musical score by Tan Dun that is a delight, with violin solos by Itzhak Perlman. The story is also cleverly told, with various versions of the same plot presented. Satisfying on many levels, "Hero" is a stylish epic that can be seen repeatedly, with more to be gained with each viewing.<br /><br />It is interesting to compare this film with Chen Kaige's exquisite "The Emperor and the Assassin," which tells basically the same story from an historical perspective. DVD extras include "Hero Defined," with interviews with the filmmakers and cast, "Storyboards," and "Inside the Action," a conversation with Jet Li and Quentin Tarantino. Total playing time is 99 minutes.<br />"People give up their lives for many reasons, for friendship, for love, or an ideal...and people kill for the same reasons."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful, likeable film degenerates into revisionist humbug"></head><body><p>The first hour of this film is magical: the stunning South American scenery lends itself to grandiose cinematography against which our two likeable young bon-vivants set about an epic journey. It really is beautifully photographed and captures the very essence of the young man's perspective on discovering the world.<br /><br />But at about the same time the boys' antique Norton blows its motor, so the film blows its narrative and veers off the dirt road and into a field of sacred cows. And as the last reel arrives it is clear there are sanctimonious cowpats aplenty: an honest, beautiful film becomes revisionist, people's poet-venerating nonsense.<br /><br />As we get to know him we discover Ernesto (pre Che, at this point known as "Fuser") isn't quite the lecherous med-student on Spring Break we were led to believe: quite the sensitive young thing, he cannot lie, even to hide painful truths; he discovers and rails against oppression; he has a Diana-like compassion for the sick, poor and helpless (no rubber gloves for him when he meets the lepers, thank you very much!); and, though badly asthmatic, he is prepared to swim across the Amazon in the dead of night simply to say farewell to his leper friends. No matter that it's never been so much as attempted before (and in real life would surely be suicidal), nor yet that there is a boat available, nor indeed that he could quite reasonably wait until the morning to bid farewell. As an unsympathetic Mother Superior watches glumly from the jetty, you might almost say Guevara walks on water.<br /><br />It's not exactly subtle, but those on the educated left will love it: our local cinema, nestled in quiet, affluent, but Guardian-reading East Finchley, greeted the end credits with spontaneous applause.<br /><br />Good grief.<br /><br />Olly Buxton</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Typical Hollywood adventure garbage"></head><body><p>I can appreciate that this movie may be more historically accurate than what we're used to.  Perhaps Arthur was in fact a Roman.  I wouldn't know, obviously, but I'm happy to take the word of someone who has looked into it, with the additional comment that I don't fully trust anyone on this issue.<br /><br />Judging the movie apart from its possible historical accuracy, I have to give it a definite thumbs down.  There is just too much wrong with it.<br /><br />There are many battle scenes.  They don't give me the feeling of battle.  They are Hollywood battle scenes, lots of closeups, lots of blood and gore, lots of heroism, and none of it looks the least bit real.  It is a bunch of nonsense.<br /><br />The dialogue is pretty bad as well.  There's nothing realistic in the characters.  I don't sense even one real person on the screen.  This isn't exactly Dustin Hoffman here.  This is a bunch of Hollywood nonsense.<br /><br />Guinevere as Wonder Woman.  Yeah, okay.  It's one thing to say that there were female warriors back then, and I have read about Boadicea.  But I bet if Boadicea did in fact participate in hand to hand fighting, she wasn't a slender beauty queen.<br /><br />Guinevere reminded me of the female warrior in Lord of the Rings.  It's nice to have a female role model to make the little girls in the theatre, in their karate classes, proud of themselves.  Why not?  It's all make believe for the guys as well.  It's like Rocky.  The real Rocky was a shlub who couldn't beat Muhammad Ali in his dreams.  The Bayonne Bleeder.  Guinevere is Miss Rocky, so good for her.<br /><br />This movie is a silly bloody fiction, and it isn't worth your time to watch, if your taste is like mine.  If you like silly bloody stories, you will like this one too.  The good guys come off quite well in it.  Don't put your money on the villain, no matter how favored he seems to be.  You want a real long shot, bet on a villain.<br /><br />One part of this movie reminds me of another famous fictional story, the one about Moses leading the Israelites through the sea, a sea which ends up swallowing the army of Egypt.  The same thing happens here, only the sea is composed of ice, temporarily.  Crackkkkkkkk.........<br /><br />I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more if the Egyptians, I mean the Saxons, were wearing swimsuits and inflated tubes.  Failing as a drama, it might have been funny as a comedy.<br /><br />To put my comments in perspective, I think that almost all of the adventure movies out today are absolute garbage.  It's not that I'm hard to please.  It's that most of the dramatic movies out now are worthless crap, unless you are into watching phony violence for the sake of enjoying the phony violence.  I'm not saying that this movie is any worse than the rest of the garbage out there.<br /><br />Here are a few of the things you learn from this movie.  First of all, Germans are bloodthirsty evil villains.  Second, Christians are stupid asses who enjoy torturing pagans.  Third, Romans were pretty awful themselves, except of course for Arthur.  Fourth, it is quite possible to shoot an arrow any number of yards, high into the air, and have it come down plunk right into a sensitive organ of a man hiding in a tree.</p></body></html>

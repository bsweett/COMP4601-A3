<meta name="summary" content="3.5 stars--Over-the-top, ridiculous, fast paced, action adventure comic book style"></head><body><p>I always feel you have to know what kind of movie you're about to watch so you can judge it accordingly. If it's based on a comic book it's going to be big, loud, dumb and ridiculous. If you don't go into "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" expecting Oscar-caliber work you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The movie is set in 1899. Characters that we know from the literature of the times are assembled as the League: Alan Quartermain, The Invisible Man, Dorian Gray, Captain Nemo, Tom Sawyer, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Dina Harker from Dracula. They are asked to work together to stop a man called The Phantom who is amassing a huge army and futuristic weapons to take over the world. You don't need to know much more because in the end it doesn't make any sense anyway. But why should it, it's source material is a comic book.<br /><br />The movie is fast paced with some good special effects and well staged action scenes. There are also some bad effects and poorly staged action scenes, cliches aplenty and some dreadful dialog. I didn't take any of it too seriously and found myself enjoying the movie quite a bit. If you absolutely can't stand people with automatic weapons shooting at point blank range and not hitting anything or effects so overblown you can't believe them, this isn't the movie for you. On the other hand, if you can suspend your disbelief and just politely shake your head at some of the more ridiculous scenes, I would recommend "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen."</p></body></html>

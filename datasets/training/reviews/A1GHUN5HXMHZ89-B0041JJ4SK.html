<meta name="summary" content="Now that's funny"></head><body><p>This will probably hit the funny bone of more guys than women, but that said it has some hysterical moments. Two guys have taken their share of abuse because of their races but life has a way of evening things out. Harold is an accountant that gets taken advantage of by his co-workers. Kumar is gifted at medicine but can't seem to take the responsibility of getting a job.<br /><br />When Harold and Kumar decide to kick back one Friday night and smoke some pot it seems like any other weekend. Then while watching a commercial for White Castle's they decide they have to pig out on "Sliders". Their journey to get there is one of those that enters the annuls of all time great road trip movies. As they start their trip it seems that what was going to be a short trip to the mall ends up bumping into parties, a wild racoon, a beating, performing surgery, fast food store, jail, Doogie Houser, and a host of other encounters.<br /><br />Fans of road trip movies like "Fandango", "Dumb and Dumber", "Road Trip", et cetera will want to catch this one. Good picture and sound and some funny extras to boot. If you like comedy you will want to buy this DVD.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Video and Audio"></head><body><p>Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.<br /><br />This is a review of the Blu-Ray version (non-3D) of this film.  The video was almost excellent.  Some of the scenes, and faces, seemed soft and dull, and that may just be how the movie was made.  Lot's of detail mostly.<br /><br />The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio ES 6.1 Matrix, whatever that means.  Anyway, it was very good to great.  Lot's of surround sound.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nice Black Comedy--Refreshing"></head><body><p>This film pushes the style of Robocop, one of the director's earlier movies, into the realm of full-blown black comedy and satire.  If you've ever wondered whether Americans are brainwashed by propaganda, this film offers a chilling answer.  I'm not sure why humans are so susceptable to patriotic blather, and why they can be so easily convinced that someone is their enemy, but this film does a good job of letting you recognize such tendencies in yourself.  It doesn't matter who started the war, why the war was started, or how it will end.  Once we're in a war, we are extraordinarily susceptable to the suggestion that we are right and just--and that the ends justify the means.  And as you watch the "brain" creature get prepared for experimental surgery, a number of chilling analogies come to mind.  No doubt, we as a species are more than capable of horrific brutality portrayed in this film.  It is "The Will to Power" for the Twentieth (and now Twenty-First) Century.  Entertaining.</p></body></html>

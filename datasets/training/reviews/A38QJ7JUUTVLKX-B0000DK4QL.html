<meta name="summary" content="What's Up with these poor reviews, this movie ROCKS!!!"></head><body><p>Believe me if I had listen to the bad reviews, I definately would have missed out on a truely amazing movie. Yes it is dark, and some viewers won't get it, but this is a superhero movie not another Citizen Kane(overated, but good). After the success of Spider-Man, Daredevil was destined for runner-up status. Darker than Spider-man (and has better special effects), this $80 million extravaganza was packaged for maximum global appeal, its the plot beginning when 12-year-old Matt Murdock who is accidentally blinded shortly before his father is murdered. Later an adult attorney in New York's Hell's Kitchen, Murdock uses his remaining, superenhanced senses to battle crime as Daredevil, the masked and vengeful "man without fear," pitted against dominant criminal Kingpin and the psychotic Bullseye, who can turn almost anything into a deadly projectile. Daredevil is well matched with the dynamic Elektra. This is a Hollywood product that die-hard fans will love. .... Why do people expect a huge deep thought provoking plot from a superhero movie! Daredevil is a must see!!</p></body></html>

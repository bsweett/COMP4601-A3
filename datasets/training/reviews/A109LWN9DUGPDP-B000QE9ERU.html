<meta name="summary" content="great movie awful blu-ray"></head><body><p>This is one of my favorite movie's however this blu-ray transfer is the worst I've seen yet and I own over 40 blu-ray disc's.First let me tell you I use a new Sony S3000 blu-ray player with a Sony XBR Bravia LCD and it is all properly calibrated so I do know what I see,having said that this picture quality is no better than the standard DVD release,maybe very very slightly more vibrant colors let me say again maybe slightly.After that there's the audio there is no PCM uncompressed or TrueHD audio,only 5.1EX its good but again the same audio as the standard dvd release.Now here's the kicker its not the extented cut which adds about 20 min. to the movie and its a worthwhile 20min. adding a new sub plot to the movie.I rarely say go for the standard dvd release or in this case the extended cut dvd,actually I've never said that but thats what I would suggest you do here,oh yeh its cheaper to.</p></body></html>

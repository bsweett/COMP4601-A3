<meta name="summary" content="Another classic performance from Pacino"></head><body><p>So we all know that Al Pacino is one of the greatest actors of all time. In his lifetime, he's been in so many classic films (The Godfather Trilogy, Dog Day Afternoon, Heat, Carlito's Way, Scent of a Woman, etc.). Scarface is definitely one of his greatest performances. Everyone who is a fan of this film, including me, can always enjoy the amount of F-words that Tony Montana (Pacino) bellows out of his mouth, or how much the character really just kicks a**. Sure, it's dark and disturbingly violent, but that's what makes it so recognizable. And it's almost amazing how this film has become a direct influence in the hip hop genre. I like hip hop, but I don't think this film should be connected with a particular music genre because it should stand on its own.<br /><br />So Pacino as Tony Montana, the gruesome violence, the insane profanity, the supporting cast (especially Bauer and Pheiffer), the 80's music, and the epic battle at the end of the film ("Say hello to ma little fwend!") makes this one of the greatest cult hits of all time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the best horror movies of all time!"></head><body><p>Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is just your everyday social misfit in high school as she has been taunted and tormented by some students as she feels like an outcast. She discovers that she has telekinetic powers, Carrie also has a psychotic religious mother (Piper Laurie) and one night at the prom she goes berserk with her powers after a cruel prank goes bad.<br /><br />Co-starring William Katt, John Travolta, Nancy Allen and Amy Irving this movie is one of the greatest cinematic horror masterpieces of all time. Brian DePalma was a great choice in directing this classic supernatural shocker and it is faithful to Stephen King's classic novel, the performances are excellent especially the cute Ms. Spacek as Carrie and the music score is quite memorable in this movie even the prom sequence that made this a classic.<br /><br />This special edition DVD has excellent picture and sound quality with fine extras like theatrical trailer, two documentaries by Brian DePalma called "Visualizing Carrie" and "Acting Carrie" with the stars of the film, A bio on Stephen King, a featurette on the broadway musical of "Carrie" and a animated photo gallery.<br /><br />Also recommended: "Scanners", "Akira", "The Shining", "Firestarter", "The Fury", "Making Contact (a.k.a. Joey)", "Sleepaway Camp", "Audrey Rose", "The Exorcist", "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "Halloween", "Scream", "Tourist Trap", "Patrick", "Ginger Snaps", "May", "The Pit", "The Rage: Carrie 2", "The Dead Zone (1983)", "Porky's", "Friday The 13th part 7: The New Blood", "X-Men Trilogy", "Suspect Zero", "The Gift" and "The Omen (1976)".</p></body></html>

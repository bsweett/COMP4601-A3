<meta name="summary" content="[3.5]--Rob Zombie is one sick director."></head><body><p>Once again, this, probably one of the sickest, most twisted and unpleasant films I've ever seen. From both a graphic and subliminal point of view it's a bit of a wonder how it got a rating actually. From the off-set the title lets you know what kind of film it's going to be (Rob Zombie probably thought it sounded cool). I thought that this movie had some good cinematography and a dusty washed out feel that has been done before but still lends the right atmosphere for this kind of violent horror.<br /><br />I don't mind violence if it is integral to the plot or if it is even scary such as in Hitchcock's Psycho. This film is neither thrilling nor scary and feels like the director had a bunch of ideas that he wanted in the movie and everything else must fit around it. The plot basically has a tense stand-off involving a Louisianan sheriff (William Forsythe) and his deputies outside a run-down, ram-shackle home where a clan of murderers dubbed 'the devil's rejects' are staking out. Following a tense stand-off and the death of a few officers, one is killed and the mother is captured. But the daughter and son continue to roam free, dodging the long arm of the law whilst also getting the chance to carry out their depraved, deadly activities on some poorer, unsuspecting victims along with the help of a twisted, ogre-some clown called Captain Spaulding.<br /><br />Weirdly, it's only when the end of the film draws near that you realize just what a nasty, unpleasant experience it's all been. I was left with a feeling similar to that of other films I've seen along the lines of Running Scared and the Kill Bill movies, only it didn't feel as though the excessiveness of the unpleasantness was being piled on so heavily that it became a laugh like with those films. But this goes a bit deeper than that, and it's nasty side is enjoyed so much that blood and gore isn't all it pumps on, we also have to endure some very disturbing, upsetting, even distressing scenes of human degradation, humiliation, callousness and the twisting of the loving nature of the female species that it's a struggle to think who'd find it enjoyable. It all ends up rubbing off on you the viewer in the end when the bad guys appear to be getting their comeuppance and you're loving watching the sheriff inflicting some of the torture on them that they inflicted on their victims, awakening your baser instincts and actually giving you the mind-set of the characters you hated so much in the first place.<br /><br />It is a nasty, blood-soaked film, just not in the way I expected it to be. But that's all it seems to be, just a non-stop bombardment of missed up unpleasantness with no real artistic value. It's not a film I'd feel comfortable watching again and it certainly didn't make me want to catch up with its predecessor, House of 1000 Corpses.</p></body></html>

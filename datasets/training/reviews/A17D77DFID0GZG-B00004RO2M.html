<meta name="summary" content="My least favorite Kubrick film."></head><body><p>"Full Metal Jacket" is a two-part film -- the first part hard realism, the second ineffective drivel sprinkled within some brilliantly stylized battle scenes.  Combined, they reflect a rather unsatisfying viewing experience,  at least, for me.<p>The first half of the film is a jarring, realistic look  at basic training, and reveals Kubrick's obsession with perfection.  Although I wasn't in the Marines (I was drafted into the Army during that  period), these scenes sparkle with realism (we had a couple very sadistic  D.I's running our company).  Too bad Kubrick chose to end the basic  training section with a ridiculous (almost comic) performance of a soldier  gone mad (shades of "The Shining" -- but way, way over done).<p>The second  part of the film shows both Kubrick's wonderful camera work along side some  of the lamest excuses for Vietnam-era lingo that I've ever seen/heard  (boring, sing-song dialogue that should have bristled with realism).  The  part where the general chastises Private Joker, then salutes him, was  agonizing to watch.  Another scene where we see one soldier after another  play to a newsreel camera, each speaking a little verse, is strictly out of  the 40's.  There is also a scene onboard a helicopter where the gunner is  shooting villagers and telling Joker that he doesn't have to lead as much  when killing the women and children.  Sorry, this doesn't work either as  comedy or as satire.  But true to Kubrick, while this ridiculous and  unbelievable scene unfolds, Private Joker's friend is listening and trying  not to throw-up (whether it's the helicopter ride or listening and watching  the gunner -- I'm not really sure).  It is this scene that is done to  perfection (honest, I think the kid was actually losing his  cookies!).<p>There is much to really love in this often brilliant,  sometimes shocking film, but alas, there is almost as much to hate.  Between 1 and 10, "Full Metal Jacket" gets a 6.  I just wish Kubrick would  have deleted those cheesy scenes that I listed, because they really brought  this movie crashing down from Kubrick's normal brilliance to  uncharacteristic mediocrity.</p></body></html>

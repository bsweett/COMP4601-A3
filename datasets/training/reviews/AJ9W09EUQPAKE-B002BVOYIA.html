<meta name="summary" content="Highly personal drama about forgotten genocide"></head><body><p>The 1994 Rwanda civil war - one of the worst civil conflicts in the 20th Century, kept in low profile as the region did not hold much sway over strategic interests of the American and European powers. Clinton's administration pulled out at a critical time and the U.N. were ineffective as around a million Tutsis were massacred by the Hutu ruling party.<br /><br />So highly relevant territory for a major film telling the true story of Raul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), owner of the 4 star Hotel des Mille Collins in Kigali, who uses his patronage to provide refuge for Hutus and Tutsis in the midst of the fighting.<br /><br />The horrific violence - medieval in its close up brutality with machetis, is not overblown at the centre of the action but lurks very close to the edges - the sinister indictments of hate broadcast on the radio, massacres viewed at long shot, eyewitness reports, overheard conversations. A range of techniques bring the conflict to life, in an almost documentary style.<br /><br />It is this aspect of the movie which makes it worth watching over the story, which is a fairly standard one of everyman rises to hero in time of conflict to protect those around him.</p></body></html>

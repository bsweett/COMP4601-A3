<meta name="summary" content="A Christmas Classic"></head><body><p>This holiday flick definitely ranks in the Top Ten Christmas films of all time, but it caters to a unique audience.  The sense of humor is succinct (not subtle) and the acting definitely outlines the minds and thoughts of many during the Christmas season.  Any film that portrays the thoughts of youngsters when Santa Claus was real...when white Christmas's meant s-o-o-o much...and the excitement of opening presents early on Christmas morn, will love this film.  I believe the best acting performance is turned in by Melinda Dillion (Mom).  She is the most believable.  Child star Peter Billingsley is cute as a blonde, blue-eyed youngster, but he has very few lines and has ample cameo shots (without dialogue).  Veteran actor Darren McGavin is silly and boisterous...but Melinda wins the show.  A must during the Christmas season, this film is funny and will warm your heart.  I'm surprised I waited so long to watch this gem. However, I wouldn't show this film to children.  The angry father (profanity) and the bullish thugs at school may frighten the very young.  All 5 stars!</p></body></html>

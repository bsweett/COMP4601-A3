<meta name="summary" content="It's Transformers...and that's it."></head><body><p>I like to really voice my opinon when it comes to movies I see and plan to own on dvd. The first Transformers film I had a great case to show that it was a good movie. Now we have the sequeal. Same director, same actors and a few new robots.<br /><br />Let me be as consice as I can. If you want to see a movie with a great plot, oscar worthy performaces and an ending that will make you leap out of your seat an applaud. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! PUT A RESTRAINING ORDER ON IT IF YOU HAVE TO! Here is the honest truth about 'Revenge of the Fallen' The acting is the worst I have seen since 'Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'. I use this movie by comparison for good reason. My intentions for seeing 'Revenge of the Sith' or any of the 3 recent installmets to the Star Wars franchise had nothing to do with the expectations of seeing a movie that was perfect with no equal. No, I just wanted to see a Star Wars movie and get closure I wanted seeing Anakin Skywalker finally become Darth Vader. By the way if you are a reader that had no idea that THAT was the outcome of Star Wars then I should personally slap you around for a bit before you climbed back under the stone you crawled out from for at least 20 years of your life. Now that I have gone completly off topic I will get back to my review. The real reason I wanted to see this highly anticipated Transformers sequel was to see sweet looking plains trains and automobiles turn in to awesome kick keister robots and signature Michael Bay explosions! Also while the plot is about as shallow as the local kiddie pool a true fan of the Transformers cartoon will get a real treat of plot devices from the orgional show. The movie is loud, fun and ficken awesome. Apparently the movie did it's job at the box office because they have green lit the third installment. So, a hit for Mr. Bay, LESS ACTING AND MORE ROBOTS PLEASE!</p></body></html>

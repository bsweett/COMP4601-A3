I must say that with this film more than others his heart seemed to be into it, not just his talent.  Hounsou is brilliant, and I hope to see him in many more productions.  Connelly was not stellar in this film.  I realize her character was supposed to come across a bit detached, but it translated more as a lack of chemistry between her DiCaprio, and even Hounsou.  I tend to think that when you are dealing with such charged subject matter that the acting doesn't have to compensate on any level, but this character/role is an example of how that is not true.  I failed to see her character's humanity, while in the other two characters, Archer and Vandy, I got very emotionally and psychologically caught up in them.  The premise of the story is volatile from the beginning, and the plot supports that momentum all the way through.  The film raises many questions about the world's involvement with and repulsion of Africa, no stone unturned.  For that reason alone I am glad to see such provocative probing of the western subconscious cast onto the silver screen.  That we see this mirror held up in a huge budget Hollywood production is great contradiction, one that I thought of often throughout the film.</p></body></html>

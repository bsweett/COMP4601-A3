<meta name="summary" content="Freddy Vs. Jason is an excellent horror movie!"></head><body><p>"Freddy Vs. Jason" is one of the excellent horror movies I have ever seen. Robert Englund returns in his signature role of Freddy Kreuger in this well made horror film that is a part of both the "A Nightmare On Elm Street" and "Friday The 13th" movies. Ken Kirzinger takes on the role of Jason Voorhees. Kirzinger is superb in his role as Jason Voorhees. Englund is just as superb as Kirzinger is. The directing by Ronny Yu is excellent and the screenplay & story is great. The production and costume design, the make-up and special effects, the cinematography, and the music are brilliant. Go see this movie now, I mean, right now!</p></body></html>

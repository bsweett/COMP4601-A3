Having seen his films "House of 1000 Corpses" and "The Devil's Rejects," I knew what I was going to see in this revamped version, but I never expected he would spend so much time (more than 30 minutes) to show Michael Myers as a 10-year-old bullied boy (played by Daeg Faerch, who is certainly convincing).<br /><br />I will not write here the details of his family; I only say it is not very pleasant to see, but maybe that is the point. Maybe Rob Zombie is just trying to give Michael a social background, something few people care. I am afraid it only deprives this horror icon of its superhuman presence. Tyler Mane did a very good job as grown-up Michael Myers, but the long introductory part that tried to (sort of) explain him has made the new "Halloween" just another serial killer movie.<br /><br />And this film is very gory. It also has nudities (more than once). Not that I am complaining. Screaming Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) is again chased by Michael Myers, and to his credit Rob Zombie has made each sequence competently, but that is all. What is shown here looks clich&eacute;d, familiar to those who have seen other slasher films, except the unique cast including William Forsythe, Danny Trejo, Bill Moseley, Brad Dourif, Richard Lynch, Dee Wallace, Sid Haig and Sybil Danning. Blink your eyes and you will miss Udo Kier and Clint Howard. (And ex-Monkees Micky Dolenz? Where was he?)<br /><br />I have watched the original "Halloween" long time ago, but I still remember some of the film's scenes were really creepy. But they were not about Michael Myers as killing machine murdering his victims; they were about Michael Myers just standing in the street as if he is something supernatural coming from another world. From the strictly technical viewpoint, Rob Zombie's re-imagined version is decent. It is only that John Carpenter's vision is replaced by Zombie's relentless descriptions of violence, which was seen in his previous films. It was about time to move on.</p></body></html>

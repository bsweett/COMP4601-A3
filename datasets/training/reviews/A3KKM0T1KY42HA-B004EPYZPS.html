<meta name="summary" content="I Didn't H8 It, But It Wasn't Gr8"></head><body><p>On the one hand, I'm not a big fan of monster movies that keep the monster mostly out of sight or hard to see throughout the movie. But knowing that was the formula that JJ Abrams used for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018QCXGY">Cloverfield</a>, my expectations were set for that...and my expectations where met. At least the Cloverfield hand held camera part of the formula was dropped for Super 8.<br /><br />On the other hand, I'm a big fan of a well written and well acted story. While Super 8 was full of moments that were simply not believable, the story flow and the amusing but accurate capture of how a group of middle schoolers interact with each other saved Super 8 from 2 star land.<br /><br />My kids loved Super 8. Although I'd hesitate to call it a great 'family' film simply based on some of the mature material and language. It's actually refreshing to see the MPAA take a more lax approach to language with a PG-13 instead of an R. I suppose having Steven Spielberg on board as producer may have had some pull.<br /><br />Basically a bunch of kids in a remote town are witness to a military train crash. Unfortunately one of the passengers on the train really wants to go home but that's not where the train was taking him...er...I mean...It. But when the train crashes this 'dark' passenger has a chance to escape and the kids do a better job of tracking down the escaped passenger than the most qualified government agency ever could. Now there's a formula that never seems to get old in Hollywood, right?...Smart civilians and kids outwit the dumb old police and military. Oy.<br /><br />So overall I was entertained by Super 8, but I walked away feeling like it was a kid's movie in PG-13 clothing.</p></body></html>

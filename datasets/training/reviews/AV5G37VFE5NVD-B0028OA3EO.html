<meta name="summary" content="Superman returns"></head><body><p>In the realm of superhero films, Richard Donner's SUPERMAN is legendary.  As far as general filmmaking goes, it's a classic.  It is single-handedly responsible for the superhero film.  To this day, it ranks as one of the very finest superhero films ever made, by which all others shall be measured.  Wisely, director Bryan Singer opted not to remake Donner's epic masterpiece.  Instead, he set writers Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris to work crafting a sort of sequel to SUPERMAN II, ignoring the last two sequels (which had never been too popular with audiences or fans).  The result is SUPERMAN RETURNS.<br /><br />At the start of the film, a brief blip explains that a group of scientists discovered the remains of the destroyed planet Krypton - which is, of course, Superman's homeworld.  The Man of Steel left his adopted planet behind and set out to investigate these remains, hoping to find one of his own kind.  Five years later, Superman - played by Brandon Routh - returns.  To his shock, things have changed - a lot.  For one thing, his nemesis Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has been released from prison.  Also, without Superman, the world's crime rate has gone way up.  The biggest shock of all - Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) is married, and has a young son!<br /><br />I remember that back when McG was helming this film, I was certain that it would fail.  McG, the man who brought us CHARLIE'S ANGELS and CHARLIE'S ANGELS: FULL THROTTLE, directing a Superman movie?  Please, no!  Though I felt a little better when McG left and Brett Ratner signed on, I was still nervous.  Then, thank the Gods, Bryan Singer - the man behind THE USUAL SUSPECTS and the comic book masterpieces X-MEN and X2 - signed on.  I breathed a long, heavy sigh of relief.  The project, I felt, was in good hands.<br /><br />Was I wrong?  No.  Not at all.<br /><br />Singer knows what to do and when to do it.  He has an eye for spectacular, thrilling visuals, but can also get great performances from his cast.  The action sequences in SUPERMAN RETURNS are some of the most exciting ever filmed.  That's not to say that this is some cheap action flick.  Hardly!  This film is just as moving and emotional as it is thrilling.  The real story of the Superman comics is the love triangle between Superman, Lois Lane, and Clark Kent.  Bryan Singer realizes this, and makes use of it.  Singer, however, sets Clark off to the side and focuses more on the relationship between Lois and Superman - which has become far more complicated now that Lois is married, and, as Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) points out, "a mommy."<br /><br />One of the big worries of every Superman fan was the casting of Superman himself.  Christopher Reeve, whose portrayal of the Man of Steel is now legendary, was perfect; to countless people, he WAS Superman.  How could anyone hope to fill his shoes?  Wisely, Bryan Singer decided to cast an unknown, just as Richard Donner had done when he made SUPERMAN.  That unknown was Brandon Routh.  And Brandon Routh is amazing.  He is very nearly, maybe even as good as the dear Mr. Reeve.  His performance resembles Reeve's, and yet Routh manages to bring his own touch to the character.  He is truly to be commended for his portrayal of the Man of Steel.  Wonderful.<br /><br />Then there's Lex Luthor.<br /><br />Possibly the most famous comic book villain, and undoubtedly one of the most popular villains in history, Lex Luthor is Superman's scheming, brilliant nemesis.  In the 1978-1987 series, he was portrayed by Gene Hackman.  Hackman's portrayal was good, very good, but he seemed a little too jokey and cowardly to me.  Where was the sinister, evil Lex Luthor of the Superman comics?  As I had suspected he would, the magnificent Kevin Spacey brings to life the maniacal, spiteful Lex Luthor of the comic books.  This Lex does not hide beneath the ground, plotting Superman's defeat while suffering his bumbling sidekicks.  Spacey's Lex DOES plot Superman's demise, but he does so with pure hatred, off to the side, surrounded by violent thugs, and when Luthor finally confronts Superman, he stands there and stares the Man of Steel right in the eye.  You can feel the hatred seeping from Lex Luthor, and from Mr. Spacey.<br /><br />I feel that Ms. Bosworth is getting some harsh and undeserved criticism from people.  Her Lois Lane is angrier than Margot Kidder's, but she has reason to be.  How could Superman, Earth's savior, just take off and leave Earth's people for five years?  I think that Bosworth is a terrific Lois, and she performs very well with Routh.<br /><br />The supporting cast includes James Marsden, who also appeared in Singer's X-MEN movies, as Richard White, Lois' fiance.  Marsden's character clearly feels that he is standing in Superman's shadow, but he never comes across as being stuck-up or a jerk; rather, we sympathize with him.  Frank Langella plays Perry White, the clever editor-in-chief of the Daily Planet.  Langella is great, better than Jackie Cooper was in the original Superman movies.  The lovely Parker Posey provides much of the comic relief, replacing Valerie Perrine as Lex Luthor's female accomplice.  Sam Huntington is very funny as young photographer Jimmy Olsen.  Eva Marie Saint appears in the film briefly as Clark's mother.  Interestingly, Saint made her big-screen debut in 1954's ON THE WATERFRONT, opposite Marlon Brando.  Through footage from Richard Donner's SUPERMAN, and unused footage from that film and SUPERMAN II, Brando returns as Jor-El.  It is wonderful to hear his soothing voice again as Superman's wise father.  Also, Jack Larson and Noel Neill, who portrayed Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane in the 1950s SUPERMAN TV series, have fun cameos.<br /><br />One of the things which troubled me during the making of the movie was the music.  John Williams' music for the original series was absolutely flawless, perfect, stupendous, magnificent - one of the greatest film scores of all time.  I was familiar with John Ottman's work through THE USUAL SUSPECTS and the X-MEN movies, but that didn't really give me much of an idea what his music for SUPERMAN RETURNS would be like.  I needn't have worried - as Ottman himself says in the liner notes for the soundtrack CD, he was a big fan of Williams' score.  What Ottman has composed is a score that is at once majestic, powerful, heart-pounding, and beautiful.  At the same time, he lets Williams' themes soar when they should.  It's truly a delight.  Should Mr. Williams ever listen to it, I'm sure he would be proud.<br /><br />Though the plot of SUPERMAN RETURNS is not the most brilliant ever conceived, the rest of the film more than makes up for it.  It is, quite simply, one of the finest superhero movies ever made.  It's a delightful, soaring, romantic adventure that is as charming as any film I've ever seen.  The cast, the script, the directing, the effects, it's all wonderful.<br /><br />The tagline for the 1978 epic famously proclaimed "You'll Believe A Man Can Fly!".  After seeing SUPERMAN RETURNS, I believe once more that a man can fly, and I believe that under the control of Bryan Singer, this new series will soar as well.  I am proud to proclaim that Superman, the Man of Steel, Krypton's last son and Earth's saviour, has most certainly returned.</p></body></html>

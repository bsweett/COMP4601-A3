<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock, Grant, and Herrmann....WUNDEBAR!"></head><body><p>Wedged between two exercises in the psychosexual ("Vertigo" and "Psycho"), Alfred Hitchcock made a truly entertaining chase flick. "North by Northwest" features a cross-country joy ride of familiar landmarks as Cary Grant's "Roger Thornhill" tries to elude both the henchmen of James Mason (SUPERB!) and our own government (headed by Hitchcock stalwart Leo G. Carroll). Eva Marie-Saint, though not as alluring as other Hitchcock "blonds" adds the right blend of mystery and sex appeal to her character. Martin Landau, in an early role, is featured as Leonard, Mason's right-hand man.<br /><br />The movie also sports a brilliantly exciting Bernard Herrmann score.<br /><br />So, set your travel plans to include a trip "North by Northwest."</p></body></html>

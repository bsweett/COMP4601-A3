<meta name="summary" content="Forget the naysayers, this film is a masterpiece"></head><body><p>From the time of it's release, Gangs of New York was destined to be a critically underrated film.  And despite the fact it was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, it didn't win a single one, losing in most categories to Chicago (Miramax's other big budget juggernaut).  However, deep within the film's flesh and bones, director Martin Scorsese has crafted a cinematic masterpiece with one of the finest cast's I've seen in a long time.  Leonardo DiCaprio, no matter what anyone might say or think about him, perfectly fits the part of Amsterdam Valon; who as a youth witnessed his gang leading father (Liam Neeson) get killed by the brutal Bill "The Butcher" Cutting (an Oscar nominated Daniel Day-Lewis).  Years later, Amsterdam returns to New York and becomes a protege of Cutting's; while all the while keeping the memory of his father's demise.  Cameron Diaz is on board here as well as a pick pocket who catches Amsterdam's eye, and she does a much better job here than she has been given credit for.  Brendan Gleeson, Henry Thomas, and John C. Reilly are on board as well in smaller roles and give good performances, although it feels as if Reilly is a bit underused considering how good an actor he is.  Daniel Day-Lewis steals the entire film with his brutally convincing performance, which is his best in years.  Yes, Gangs of New York is a bloody and violent film, but nowhere near the excessive violence and gore of some past films which have been regarded as modern day classics.  All in all, Gangs of New York is an underrated modern day masterpiece that displays the film's marketing tagline: "America Was Born in the Streets".</p></body></html>

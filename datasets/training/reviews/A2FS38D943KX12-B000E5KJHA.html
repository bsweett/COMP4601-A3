<meta name="summary" content="Weirdly entertaining & ultimately satisfying"></head><body><p>Taken strictly on its own merits, this film is extremely entertaining.  While Burton clearly revels in special effects & Danny Elfman enjoys flexing his versatile musical muscles, neither of these things gets in the way of a story well-rendered and well-told.  The movie moves briskly to its climax, so much so that the viewer may be surprised at how quickly the time has passed.<br /><br />For those who absolutely ripped this movie because it was not a carbon copy of the 1971 Gene Wilder version --- it isn't a remake, anymore than the assorted versions of "Romeo & Juliet" could be considered remakes of earlier film versions.  It is a reinterpretation of what was already a classic work of fiction, and for my money, it is far superior in staying true to Dahl's vision.  So you miss the Oompa-Loompa song, plus all of the other ditties from 1971?  Too bad --- watch the original if it means that much to you.  Burton's version contains none of these songs, but instead takes the novel approach of relying on Dahl's original lyrics (always crucial in any of his books), so conspicuously absent from the 1971 version. For those critical of Burton's inclusion of a storyline not in the original, it pales in comparison to the numerous 1971 deviations.<br /><br />Certainly Burton's production values absolutely blow the earlier version out of the water, yet they don't seem to get in the way of telling the story.  Too many movies get caught up in the special effects to the point that they tend to bog down a movie that they were intended to enhance.  Burton is able to avoid this trap.<br /><br />Johnny Depp, true to form, nails his performance of an eccentric man-child whose weirdness is obvious yet difficult to pinpoint.  Depp's Wonka makes the adults uncomfortable without being off-putting, yet for all of his innate childishness, is also unable to relate to the assorted brats that cross his path during the tour of the factory.  Depp's Wonka seems to be an interesting amalgam of Ed Wood, JM Barrie & Edward Scissorhands, but remains a strikingly original character despite hints of these earlier roles.<br /><br />Deep Roy absolutely cracked me up in ways that the barely mobile 1971 Oompah-Loompahs never could.  Obviously the advances in technology made it possible for the Oompa-Loompas to be much more versatile in their songs & rountines, and I found them to be consistently entertaining.<br /><br />The various children, in particular those playing Charlie and Veruca Salt, were utterly convincing in their roles.  The boy playing an updated (but all too relevant) version of Mike Teavee makes his character simultaneously fascinating & frightening.  Not enough can be said in praise of the delightful David Kelly (best known from his role in "Waking Ned Devine), who steals virtually every scene in which he appears.<br /><br />It should be noted that this is by no means a childrens' film.  The screening I attended featured an approximately 3-year-old child whimpering in terror as the squirrels dragged Veruca Salt to the garbage chute.  Other children in the audience that were under the age of 10 seemed to respond only to the occasional moments of slapstick involving Willie Wonka and the glass elevator.  Significant portions of the movie will be completely over the heads of most children, no matter what their ages.  Of course, for the adults, there are endless moments of wry humor to appreciate.<br /><br />All in all, this was a very entertaining and enjoyable movie.  In time I suspect that the 1971 version will be relegated to the shadows, and Burton's vision will stand alone, unchallenged.</p></body></html>

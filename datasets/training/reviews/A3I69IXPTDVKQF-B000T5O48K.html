<meta name="summary" content="Dark Drama-Horror"></head><body><p>One of the most recent entries in the increasingly potent drama/horror hybrid field, "Bug" finds Ashley Judd playing a depressed and occasional drug-dabbling woman living in a small motel room close to the little town where she works serving drinks at a loud, boisterous bar.  With a troubled past that includes an abusive husband and a long-vanished child, she becomes deeply afriad when she starts getting annoymous phone calls shortly after her ex is released from prison.  When a fellow barmaid brings a new male friend over to Agnes (Judd's character)'s place for the evening, he (Michael Shannon) and Judd form a connection and later begin to grow closer.  It seems at first that the two may help one another get over their mutual loneliness, but he's got a very secretive nature, and, possibly, some very deep secrets to hide.<br /><br />  Peter (Shannon's character) is either insane or carrying some very nasty secrets within himself.  And then the bugs start appearing, small in number, at first...<br /><br />  Grim, even dreary at times (but proving itself one of the very few movies that can carry off extended periods of such bleakness and emotional desolation), full of horrors like domestic violence, emotional isolation and post-traumatic stresses, and possibly much weirder horrors as well; "Bug" also has a strange beauty to it.  That, and virtuoso performances, help prevent the movie from becoming overly depressing and creates a great film for both horror fans and drama fans.  Intense, dark, and very different from anything else out there, "Bug" surpassed my expectations and is a very rewarding movie, although in a bizarre way.  Not for everyone, I suppose, but way better than it's reputed to be.</p></body></html>

One man rides a train; he seems stunned and unaware of himself. A double-decker train carries commuters to Chicago. There is an explosion outside! Next there is a strange event where he is questioned. "Who bombed the train?" We return to the train. More strange behavior. He searches a restroom and finds a strange machine. He warns the crew. There is an explosion. Is it real? Is it confusing? "This makes no sense." Who is the bomber? Quiet and withdrawn? "Anything strange on the train?" [The actors in this story?] He gets off the train to follow a man. Motion sickness? There is a fight, a man falls on the tracks. Then we see more strange events. Who is controlling things? We finally learn of the reason for this exercise: a terrorist will explode a "dirty bomb" in Chicago!<br /><br />His next assignment is to find the conducter's room. He fails in this. "Everything is going to be OK." The scenes repeat. The man acts strange. He borrows a phone from a lady. There is another change of scenery. "Am I dead?" Is he imagining all this? His controllers speak to him. Can he find the bomber? "Send me back in." He finds the bomb with its cell phone activator. Did he find the bomber? "Sorry." He follows another man. Will he lose him? "I know its you." There is a surprise in the trunk. The man explains his actions. "There has to be rubble." He now has the bomber's name. He has a last request. The SWAT team gets the driver. A job well done. The story runs on. Will his mission be terminated? "Thank you for your service. Good luck!" So now the story repeats again. Shawn disarms the bomb.<br /><br />Will they clear his memory? He stops Derek Frost. "It's over." He makes a phone call. Then another to a dead soldier's father. "Are you OK?" There is conversation among the passengers. They are not friendly. Shawn makes a bet with a man; can he make the other passengers laugh? The red button is pushed. We see the body! "It is a beautiful morning in Chicago." "Do you believe in fate?" "So what do you want to do today?" Goodwin gets a text message on her phone. "Tell him everything will be OK."<br /><br />This is a very strange story that repeats itself over and over (to create padding and make it appear that something is happening). Not recommended. It shows why the story or plot is the most important part of any movie. The end shows a long list of names for the people who worked on this production. So who paid for this production? There were other movies about people being threatened by terrorists with a bomb. They were all better.</p></body></html>

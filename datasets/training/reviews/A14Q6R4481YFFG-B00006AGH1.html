<meta name="summary" content="Tom Clancy sold out"></head><body><p>The WSJ had an article a few years ago ("How to Market Movie About the Bomb So It Won't Be One," May 30, 2002) where Clancy admitted he changed the bad guys from Arabs to neo-Nazis for the movie because he wanted to be "sensitive to stereotypes."  Pathetic, absolutely pathetic.  Is it a stereotype to say that the biggest terrorist attack in the history of the world was carried out by Arab men?  The one group that Hollywood still feels it can beat up on is neo-Nazis, even if it's completely ridiculous.  I guarantee you, most neo-Nazis in this country are more interested in getting enough money together to buy a six-pack, than trying to get their hands on a nuke to blow up their own country.  Foreign Nazis?  Even more lame.<br /><br />On the other hand, if Clancy (who's an executive producer of the movie, so he's got NO excuse) had had the integrity to keep the Arabs as the bad guys, we could have had an ultra-realistic, prescient, hard-hitting and thought-provoking movie.  Shame on you Mr. Clancy, shame!</p></body></html>

The premise draws upon `D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu' and `Medium' with much of the atmosphere of  `The Sixth Sense'.  (There's even a shower scene where the seer comes upon her beloved.)  Can we change events of our loved ones if we can see in the future?  After watching this film I felt like I had been here before.  Despite some retread the movie has some redeeming values.<br /><br />First of all `Premonition' does live up to its title.  The movie opens with Linda (Sandra Bullock) listening to her husband giving a phone message into their answering machine.  Shortly after she answers the door and is greeted by a police officer.  Somberly, the man tells her that her husband was in a serious car accident, and he didn't survive.  She is incredulous.  Not merely shock, but she understandably thinks it a mistake given the context of her husband's message.<br /><br />From there we get fragmented events that make it seem like Linda is bumping into the future.  People she doesn't know address her and loved ones provide details she is oblivious about.  Meeting with her mother, who is a significant caretaker for her two children, she seems out of it, forlorned, bewildered.  Then, sleep becomes something of a portal, or maybe a change of consciousness.  When Linda awakes everything is back to normal.  Jim is alive, the children are fine, and the forbidding omens disappear.  Unlike many other films, the time frame gets shuffled, so she often loses track of what day it is and which events are meant to stay in sequence.<br /><br />Added to her turmoil is the aspect of psychiatric care.  It gives us a sense of ambiguity done in movies like 'Donnie Darko' where we have to figure out what the true source of her problems in the story.  Many of those bumps in the future feature Linda being treated by Dr. Roth (Peter Stormare), a psychiatrist.  Besides sharing with her best friend Annie, she really confides her dilemma with him.  Obviously, not specializing in paranormal psychology, he gives her a prescription for lithium instead of an outlook of the future.<br /><br />She also seeks advice from the parish priest.  He gives her good advice, but, then, Linda is on her own.  She must decide what to do with the future she's been presented.  Can she save her husband?  Do the visions give her some command of the future?<br /><br />There are many aspects to admire in `Premonition'.  The movie does keep an up to date standard of edginess.  Even though it relies on music and editing more than most, and there`s one scene that uses a shaky pivoting camera to express the strife when Linda is confronting her family.  Sandra Bollock gives a fine performance as Linda.  Through her we can truly see Linda's grief and frustration.  On the other hand, some of the other omens don't fit in the story as well.  Perhaps disasters come in threes, but when Linda is startled by an explosion of a telephone wire, a crow is killed and lays before her.  It matches an event foreseen before, but it doesn't tell us much.  And that's how I left 'Premonition'.  Surely, most people won't be angry or overly disappointed after having watched this movie, but it leaves a lot of unanswered questions.<br /><br />I believe the movie will appeal to the masses who are yearning for "family values" in their films.  The moviemakers' motives are admirable, but the execution of the story is so riddled with mysterious roadblocks that it made me feel like I had a long and cruel joke played on me.</p></body></html>

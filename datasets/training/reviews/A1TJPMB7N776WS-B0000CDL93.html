<meta name="summary" content="It's Stone's Throw"></head><body><p>The beauty of Oliver Stone's "JFK" is that it has and will for a long time still, engender a mass of hate, love, incomprehension and good old America debate.<br />Just this last week, being the 40th Anniversary of the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, there were two documentaries televised: one supported the claim of the lone gunman theory and the findings of the Warren Commission while the other supported the two+ gunman conspiracy theory with all the attendant evidence in support. Is there any wonder that we as a Nation have no idea what/who/why happened on November 22, 1963 in Dallas? Stone's "JFK" seems heavily dependent on the second 7 hour BBC produced documentary (ridiculous in that it is better researched that the Warren Commission!) for many of it's facts, though the BBC program looked at Jim Garrison's contribution to the investigation as a sidelight not the main event.<br />Be all of that as it may, this film is a lollapalooza: a fascinating, dramatic, though obviously slanted look at what was the most important and riveting event in American history until 9/11. And Stone does a tremendously effective job of marshalling all of the facts, fiction and theories into a dramatic whole. This is not a documentary, this is a film based on fact.  And since the only fact we all can all agree on is that someone shot JFK in Dallas on 11/22/63, it seems to me that everything else is open to speculation and interpretation.<br />Kevin Costner gives a bravura performance as Jim Garrison: a man so conflicted and so troubled by the assassination that he feels compelled to bring someone to trial for it. His summation scene, which goes on for nearly 45 minutes towards the end of "JFK" is so moving, so strongly felt, so incisively acted, so emotionally aware that we actually see Costner underneath the performance as Garrison: the third wall is removed and it is Costner not only speaking to us, he is speaking for us.<br />We will never know exactly what happened in Dallas on that Friday afternoon 40 years ago, but we do have this film and Costner's performance as a reminder of what can happen when someone of intelligence and foresight tackles a problem and proposes a hypothesis: right or wrong is not the issue, making the effort is.</p></body></html>

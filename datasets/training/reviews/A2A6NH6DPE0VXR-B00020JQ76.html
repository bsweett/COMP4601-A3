Um hello lol, Rundown doesn't just mean being exhausted it can mean being chased down and in this case that's what it means. The Rock's character Beck who's a repo-man is sent to South America to find his boss's son (Sean William Scott from American Pie fame). After he finds him and hits him around a bit the duo have no choice but to team up to in-order survive. Some rebels headed by the great Christopher Walken are after a price-less artifact and are willing to kill anyone that stands in there way. Beck wants to retire and become a chef but he has to survive his trip to South America first. <p>  The Rock is charming, funny and dangerous at the same time as Beck. There's no doubt that he has a future in movies behind him. I heard he might get into politics but I hope he just sticks with Wrestling and Movies because that's what he does best. He works great with Sean William Scott and Rosario Dawson who both are good in their roles as well. Anyway the Rundown is an entertaining and often very funny movie. I mean in what other move are the 2 heros almost raped by a bunch of horny monkeys ? lol. It's some funny and original stuff.</p></body></html>

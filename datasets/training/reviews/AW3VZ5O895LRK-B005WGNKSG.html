<meta name="summary" content="As Good As The Novel--Very Rare Feat"></head><body><p>Usually when a novel is a huge critical and popular success, the movie ends up being a disappointment.  Not so in this case.  In fact, this is so perfect an adaptation that I can only hope that we Americans don't try and remake it.  A large part of the reason this works is that it is so obviously Swedish.  The actors are Swedish, the language is Swedish, the setting is Sweden, and so on.  It is perfectly authentic.<br /><br />The biggest challenge was finding the right actress to play Lizbeth Salander, the heroine of this story.  The actress here is outstanding, the perfect choice.  The next lead role, of Bloomquist the journalist, is also well filled. He is a middle aged man whose personality dominates over his appearance, which is exactly right.<br /><br />If you have not managed to read the book, the plot revolves around Salander who was an abused child both by her father and the Swedish government.  As an adult, she has formidable skills.  She is a renowned hacker, the best in Sweden.  She has a photographic memory.  She can scheme and outthink just about anyone.  However, her father and Swedish government still have her as a target so she is never safe.<br /><br />She meets Blomquist to solve the alleged murder of a wealthy young woman from several decades ago.  The patriarch of her wealthy family assumes she was murdered by a family member and he wants the case solved. Sander and Bloomquist are off and running.<br /><br />Although all three novels were excellent, and the same can be said for the movies, it is this first one which is the best all around.</p></body></html>

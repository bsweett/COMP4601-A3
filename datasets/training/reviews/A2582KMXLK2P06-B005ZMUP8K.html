<meta name="summary" content="decent, yet weird action scenes"></head><body><p>I was never a fan of these Pirates of the Caribbean movies.  I mean, they have plenty of exciting and distinct scenes that make the movies stand apart from other pirate films, but trying to follow along to any kind of plot is a very difficult thing to do.  What was going on throughout the movie?  Why were certain fight scenes happening?  What were those giant worms that were popping out of the water and attacking the ship?  I guess the overall weirdness is supposed to be unique to the viewers, and the reason the series caught the attention of millions, but, I don't know.  I'd just like to know what was going on.<br /><br />Also, I'm not a fan of the way the movie comes off like I'm watching a play.  Seriously, it's like the whole time I was sitting in the audience watching Johnny Depp do his typical weird pirate mannerisms on a giant stage.  That's kind of a turn off.</p></body></html>

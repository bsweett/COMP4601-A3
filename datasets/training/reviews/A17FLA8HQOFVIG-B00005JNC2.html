<meta name="summary" content="An aura of sadness.  Also pretentious, stupid and boring."></head><body><p>This 2004 film is supposed to be a comedy.  But it sure didn't get any laughs out of me.  Not even a giggle.  Zach Braff wrote it, directed it and starred in it.  I guess he's satisfied.  The film did well and it even got a couple of awards.  I just can't understand it.  This film was pretentious, stupid and boring.  And that's the nicest things I can say about it.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a young man, living in Los Angeles, who comes home to New Jersey to attend his mother's funeral. He's been on mood dulling medications since he was 9 years old but he decides to give them up cold turkey before he gets on the plane.  He's an anti-hero type.  In other words he's passive and wide eyed and an observer of the world rather than an active participant.  Along the way he meets Natalie Portman and a romance develops.  But there is a aura of sadness around the whole film because of a secret involving his mother's health that has deeply affected this troubled young man.<br /><br />I hated this film and the only reason I watched it all al was because I was with a friend who wanted to see it.  And so I managed to see it all, hoping it would get better as it went along.  It didn't.  This is an awful film.  Don't bother.</p></body></html>

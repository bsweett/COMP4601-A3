I would love to visit Ceylon but of course not during war. Its beauty is just absolute. The picture's story was also quite good. The overall theme to me was is there honor in wartime. To we become quite human and do what we can to survive or do we cling to the rules and stay soldiers to the end. In the movie Alec Guiness plays the rule oriented Major caught in a prison camp being told to build a bridge with his other subordinates, should he keep up the farce and play Major or leader until they are freed, following the rules no matter if it kills him. William Holden who is one of the subordinates disagrees, one other sees his point. Guiness becomes obsessed with his leadership and the bridge is his projection of obsession and his eventual demise. A stunning visual feast. Ceylon is and should be a dream come true not a place for negative energy to florish.<br />Lisa Nary</p></body></html>

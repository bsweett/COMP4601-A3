<meta name="summary" content="Decent, but I liked Terminator 2 better"></head><body><p>Terminator 3 does an average job of attempting to explain itself. There is both a prologue and epilogue that attempts to explain and link this movie with the other Terminators. We get to learn of how the world came to be in the future, and how, after visited by another T-101, John Connor is now the new leader to try to save the world from the rise of the machines. He meets up with Kate Brewster (Clair Danes) through a series of events and she also learns her role in the future of mankind. <p>I didn't really go into this movie believing it would be much, but was pleasantly surprised with some of the acting, action sequences and plot. However, as usual in action movies, some of the chase scenes were dragged out incredibly long. I think if this movie would have focused more on building a solid story line through building the characters it would have made for a more effective story. <p>One thing that definitely was a negative was the character of John Connor. He comes across as a whiny, Generation X slacker type that no one watching feels sorry for. He seems to spend his time feeling sorry for himself and complaining about having to lead mankind. He tends to become an irksome point of the movie, and hardly fits the description of &quot;hero.&quot; If they would have made him a stronger character I think it would have vastly improved the script.<p>Still, Terminator 3 is a fun movie. Sequels are definitely one of the hardest types to make successful, and I believe that Terminator 3 succeeds, albeit in a &quot;ho-hum&quot; way. <p>Recommended if you take it in with a relatively open mind.</p></body></html>

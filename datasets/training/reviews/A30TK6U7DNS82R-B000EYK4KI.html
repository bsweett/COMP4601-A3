<meta name="summary" content="Better than Hitchcock's "Mr and Mrs Smith""></head><body><p>It must have seemed like a great idea at the time for Adam Brody's management, get your client a key part in the new Brad Pitt Angelina Jolie thriller, MR AND MRS SMITH, directed by Doug Liman, for whom Adam had already proved a breakout star for his role playing Seth Cohen on THE O.C.<br /><br />Well, what on earth happened?  As it stands, the movie seems to be thumbing its nose at young Brody, featuring him in the second reel for about 1 minute and a half, when the boss calls him into the office and his officious secretary knocks him down to size by not letting him cross the threshold.  The audience isn't given the chance to know what this is all about, and he's completely forgotten till about an hour later, when he pops up in a car, being transported to a highsecurity federal prison.  Do we ever find out why?  It doesn't matter, we never really care about his character.  When Brad Pitt threatens him with physical pain, and when Angelina Jolie hits him across the face with a telephone, there's not much at stake, for we still don't know who he is or how he got suckered into appearing in the movie.  Was it to give the project some teen credibility, the way John Wayne was forced into hiring Ricky Nelson or Frankie Avalon in minor roles in his later Westerns?  If so, how ludicrous, because all Adam Brody brings to the part is a trademark dorkiness which makes us think that a cheeky smirk is all he has to offer.  He should fire all his advisors who had him take this role.  Yeah, how's that screen career coming, Seth Cohen?<br /><br />Other than this miscalculation, the star power of Pitt and Jolie burns like a city on fire.  They are perfectly matched and no wonder they fell in love or whatever!  She has never been better and her acting, here a series of mumbles, smirks and fleeting realizations, could almost be mistaken for a lost performance by the divine Louise Brooks.  Asked how long they've been together, Pitt says, "Five years," and Jolie mutters, "Six."  This exchange happens over and over, and it's funnier each time.  (I know it doesn't sound very funny but believe me, in context it is.)  And I know the Hitchcock comedy from 1941 isn't actually the original of this movie, but Liman outdoes Hitchcock at the comedy of manners, heretical as it may be to say.  I'm just putting it out there.<br /><br />My wife wanted to see "that movie about Captain John Smith" (THE NEW WORLD) and this is what they sent us!  For Brad Pitt's name is "John Smith" in this film.  How odd is that?</p></body></html>

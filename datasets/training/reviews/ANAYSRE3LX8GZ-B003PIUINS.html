<meta name="summary" content="Part 2 is even better!"></head><body><p>Having seen part 2 before i'd seen this one, i have to say, that the seaqull was much better IMO! If you wanna see a refreshign new way to present a horror film? then get both these flicks! Its not that same old boring slasher WHOS next to be killed kind of movie...its HOW are they going to be killed?<p>When whatshisface has a premonition that the plane is about to explode. He retreats taking a few others with him. And of coarse, the plane does explode! But death has a plan, and there not out of the clear. Death is stalking them anyway it can to kill them, and there on the run from a mysterious force!<p>I strongly recomend you get this with part 2 aswell! The seaqull was even better!<p>The bonus features are pretty cool, theres some insights to the movie, and a documentry on phychic ability that might intrest those intrested in that stuff? <p>This is a breath of fresh air for horror movies, as it doesnt evolve around the same old ,done to death type of slayings!</p></body></html>

Eleven men led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) prepare to rob a vault linked to 3 casinos in Las Vegas. His partners in crime include Brad Pitt, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould, Caset Affleck, Matt Damon and Scott Caan. Also, the casinos are owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) who is romancing Ocean's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts). Fun, engrossing, simply the most enjoyable film of 2001. It moves smoothly, the entire cast plays it cool and easy and Steven Soderbergh directs it with flair and intelligence. <p>Yes, it's light, yes, it's a trifle but it's so fun! I really loved this film. Affleck and Caan are hilarious as bickering brothers. My only complaint - Julia Roberts (the only woman in the cast) is shot very cruelly. She's beautiful but her looks in this movie do not reach their full potential. Aside from that this is a fun movie. Just sit back and enjoy.</p></body></html>

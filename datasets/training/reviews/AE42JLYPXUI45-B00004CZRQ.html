<meta name="summary" content="The Exorcist (1973)"></head><body><p>In 1973, the scariest movie was released over an audience that dared to watch it. This scariest film of all time is entitled...THE EXORCIST. This film turned athiests into Catholics, it sent non-church-going Catholics to Church every Sunday, and it pretty much scared the living daylights out of every human being on this planet. Read on...if you dare.<br /><br />  In Northern Iraq, FATHER LANKESTER MERRIN (played by Max von Sydow), a priest, who is also an archeologist, is digging up artifacts of the country, when he comes across a frightening piece...the face of Pazuzu, one of Satan's diciples. As he leaves Iraq and heads back to the states, he happens to get a glimpse of the stature of Pazuzu, the full statue.<br /><br />  In Washington D.C., there lives an actress named, CHRIS MacNEIL (played by Ellen Burstyn). Living with here is her 12-year-old daughter, REGAN (played by Linda Blair). One night, while reading over a script for her next acting role, Chris begins hearing strange noises in her attic. She begins to suspect that rats are in the attic. How stupid can you be to think that rats are THAT big?<br /><br />  While walking home the next day, after a day's work of shooting a few scenes of her next movie, Chris happens to pass by the local church, where she sees FATHER DAMIEN KARRAS (played by the brilliant Jason Miller). She saw Father Karras at the shoot early in the day. Late that afternoon, Father Karras is introduced properly as he visits his mother, who is very sick. Karras wants to have her in a nice retirement home, where she'll be properly taken care of, but Mrs. Karras does not want any part of that.<br /><br />  That night, Regan and Chris are down in the basement, where Chris finds a Ouija board. Regan already knows how to work it, so she shows Chris how it's done. But for some reason, it does not want Chris to be involved. Oh, well, can't dwell over our losses...or can we? Over the course of the next two days, the noises in the attic begin getting louder and louder, Regan has been claiming that her bed has been shaking. Chris takes Regan to the doctor, where he diagnoses her with a nervous disorder.<br /><br />  As Father Karras learns that his mother has sadly passed on, Chris holds a party at her house to celebrate the ending of her next film, which is entitled, CRASH COURSE. The director of CRASH COURSE, BURKE DENNINGS (played by Jack MacGowan) leaves early because he ended up pretty trashed. Chris and SHARON SPENCER (played by Kitty Winn), the woman who home-school's Regan, who also leaves with Regan and Chris, joins the last few guests of the party around Chris' piano. Playing the piano is FATHER JOSEPH KEVIN DYER (played by Reverand William O'Malley). Father Dyer is a close friend of Chris', despite the fact that Chris and Regan are athiests. As the guests sing along, they are joined by Regan, who looks at one of the guests claims so evil that..."You're gonna die up there", and then urinates on the carpet. The other guests leave the party, as Chris' maid, WILLI (played by Gina Petrushka) tries to scrub the urine stain out of the carpet. But at that moment, Chris hears Regan scream terribly. She runs into Regan's bedroom to find Regan's bed violently shaking on it's own. Chris jumps on the bed to protect Regan as well as trying to get the bed to stop shaking.<br /><br />  The next day, Chris takes Regan back to the doctors to find out what the hell is going on, where the doctors perform an MRI and an EKG. They look at the results only to find that there is no disturbance in Regan's brain. At that moment, the doctors get a call from Chris, where they make a house call to the MacNeil house. Sharon informs the doctors that Regan is still having those A.D.H.D. episodes, but they have gotten severly violent. They enter Regan's bedroom, where growls in a deeply horrifying voice. She sits up, punches one of the doctors in the face, and says in a deep, man's voice..."Keep away, this sow is mine...", and then gets into a sexual position and simply says, "F--- me! F--- me! F--- me!", which is where the doctors heavily sedate her.<br /><br />  The next night, Chris comes back from the doctors office, where she is informed that a psychiatrist for Regan is more than neccessary. She arrives home and checks on Regan, where her bedroom window is wide open. She closes the window and heads downstairs, where Sharon arrives home. Chris scolds Sharon for leaving Regan by herself, but Sharon claims that she didn't leave Regan alone, for she called Burke Dennings over to keep an eye on Regan, while Sharon went off to get more of Regan's medication. That is when one of Chris' co-actors from her movie arrives to tell her that Burke Dennings...has been killed. He fell down the stairs outside the house and rolled down the street, where he broke his neck, to which his neck was turned completely around, making a 180, facing backward. That is when Regan comes downstairs...in her frightening spiderwalk.<br /><br />  The next morning, while going for a run, Father Karras meets LT. WILLIAM KINDERMAN (played by Lee J. Cobb). They discusss Burke Dennings murder, where the two go on about their business. The same day, Chris is discussing with the doctors about Regan's case, where the doctors inform her that Regan's condition is most likely not medical, but spiritual, which is where they tell Chris that Regan maybe under demonic possession and needs an exorcism.<br /><br />  She takes Regan home and puts her in bed, where she finds a crucifix. She confronts Willi, Sharon, and KARL (played by Rudolph Schundler), who is Chris' servant, about the crucifix, but they all claim they had nothing to do with it. That is when Lt. Kinderman arrives and discusses Regan's case, as well as Burke Dennings' murder. As he leaves, Chris hears Regan scream in horror and fright. She runs up and finds Regan in bed masturbating with the crucifix, and saying (in a deep, man's voice) something that is to sac-religious to review here. Chris tries to grab the crucifix from Regan, but Regan grabs her mother's head and shoves her face into her daughter's bloodied up privates and says, "Lick me! Lick me!" She then punches Chris' face, where Chris goes down with force, where Regan's head makes a 180, where Burke Dennings' voice takes over Regan, saying, "Do you know what she did? Your C---ing dauther?!"<br /><br />  The next day, Chris has a meeting with Father Karras. Now, as I said, Chris has no religious beliefs, but she is desperate need for religious seeking. She has Father Karras come by to see Regan, where Regan is fully under demonic possession, her face green and severly scarred, her eyes almost like a werewolf's eyes, her voice in a demon's voice. Father Karras introduces himself as who he is, where Regan introduces herself as..."and I'm the DEVIL!!!!". Apparently, Regan is not possessed by a demon, but by the Devil himself.<br /><br />  He comes back the next day to make sure that this possession is for real. Father Karras finds Regan speaking Latin, a language that Regan has never learned before. He sprinkles water on Regan, claiming that the water is Holy water. Regan reacts to it very violently. Father Karras goes to the Church and asks for the permission to perform an exorcism on Regan. He is given the approval, but he is to have help alongside of him...Father Merrin is the one to perform the exorcism with Father Karras. The reason for allowing Father Merrin perform the exorcism, despite his severe heart condition, is the fact that back in the 1940s, Father Merrin had performed an exorcism back in Africa. The exorcism supposedly last for months, but the exorcism was a complete success.<br /><br />  The two arrive at the house, to perform the ritual. They enter the room and begin the ritual. For the next 15-20 minutes, the exorcism takes place, and very horrifyingly. Father Karras and Father Merrin decide to take a little rest before it's time to start again. They enter the room, where Regan begins imitating Karras' deceased mother. Karras goes downstairs to get it together. He goes back to Regan's room to find Father Merrin...dead. He grabs Regan and begins beating her, where he shouts..."You son of a b****, come into me!!!" Father Karras finds himself possessed by the devil, where he tries to kill Regan, but Karras, with the control he needs, jumps out the window, down the stairs, and lands at the bottom of the stairs. The whole neighborhood arrives at the scene over Karras' body. Father Dyer arrives (since he and Father Karras are very close friends) and gives Father Karras a last confession.<br /><br />  The next morning, Chris and Regan prepare to leave their house, for the exorcism is overwith and a complete success, since Chris' movie is now finished. As they leave, Chris hands Father Dyer a necklace that was worn by Father Karras, but Father Dyer wants Chris to keep it, where he watches Chris and Regan drive off.<br /><br />  This, as I had stated, is the, if not one of, the scariest movie of all time. I have seen many scary movies in my day, but I have never seen a horror film that was this scary. This film will forever remaina cult classic.</p></body></html>

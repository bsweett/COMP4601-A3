<meta name="summary" content="Divine"></head><body><p>I have made two previous attempts to sit through pulp fiction, both unsuccessful, I'd see a little more in each and then dismiss it.<br />I finally gave the whole thing a watch. To say that I'm overwhelmed would be a fitting analysis. I had to go pee after watching the last scene.<br />I do not think any thriller will match it's quotient. Loved the definition of divine intervention and I highly acclaim Tarantino's style of dialogue and conversation flow he adds to films making you forget you are watching a film like nooone else does. At his best, he is better than Speilberg, Martin Scorsese and even my Godfather Sam Mendes.<br /><br />Have you seen 12 Angry Men? If not, I highly recommend it.<br />I do think like me you have seen Pulp fiction in parts but that would be a product of wishful thinking.<br />You might have seen the whole thing.<br /><br />One of the best films I've had a privilege of seeing.<br />It makes Death Proof, Departed, Kill Bill look rather tame.</p></body></html>

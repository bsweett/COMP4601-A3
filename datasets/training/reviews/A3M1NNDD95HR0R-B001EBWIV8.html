For instance, Trinity on that black Ducati sportbike!  She RULED!  Don't try that at home kids...  But let's not leave Neo out.  That one fight scene where Neo uses the sign post as a Bo staff and lets loose on like 100 agents at once!  BAM!  How about them apples?  I am a big fan of the Matrix trilogy.  In fact, the first one is my favorite movie.  But even so, in many ways Reloaded is equally good.  I recommend you get all 3 movies.  They are really hot titles, and their replay value is high.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

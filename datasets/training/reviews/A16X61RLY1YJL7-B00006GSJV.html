<meta name="summary" content="An exceptional film!"></head><body><p>As we all know, hollywood takes a true story and adds some embellishment to it.  That said, this film is one of the classics.  Russell Crowe again shows why he's making the money he is to do a movie.  Ron Howard's direction is admirable.  A wonderful movie about life, the struggles that some people have to get through and move on.  I would suggest this movie to anybody who enjoys what movies are all about.</p></body></html>

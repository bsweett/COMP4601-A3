<meta name="summary" content="Jack is stuck in a morgue drawer and becomes unstuck in time"></head><body><p>You would never think it from the title, but "The Jacket" is a time travel story.  As such, it is a relatively low keyed one, and reminded me of episodes of television shows like "The Twilight Zone," "Quantum Leap," and even "Early Edition," for various reasons that should be apparent once you watch this 2005 film from director John Maybury ("Love Is the Devil: Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon").<br /><br />Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) is in the army during the first Gulf War when he takes a bullet to the brain.  Jack should be dead, but he survives, although he has severe memory problems.  Consequently, when he is charged with a murder he did not commit he ends up being sent to a mental hospital.  There he becomes the patient of Dr. Thomas Becker (Kris Kristofferson) who has an unusual way of treating Jack.  He puts Jack into a straight jacket, shoots him full of drugs, and shoves him in a cabinet in the morgue.  Becker thinks that this would be a good thing, but with a Nurse Ratchet type named Harding (Mackenzie Phillips) helping him, we have our doubts.  However, whatever Becker was thinking would happen to Jack, having his patient travel in time fifteen years into the future was certainly not on the list.<br /><br />At this point, when you want to roll your eyes over this proposed method of time travel, I want to point out that since time travel is impossible that there never can be a method that will truly pass mustard in this respect.  But if we are talking really stupid nothing beats "Somewhere in Time" where Christopher Reeves's character "thinks" himself back to the past.  More importantly, that particular film proved that it is not what time travel theory you come up with but what you do with the story and your characters once you pull something out of your hat.  Especially since that becomes the strength of "The Jacket."<br /><br />Before his life went from bad to worst, Jack had a chance encounter with a young girl and her mother.  They might not be able to provide an alibi for the crime, but they would at least prove that he actually remembered something real.  In the future, Jack encounters the little girl, Jackie (Keira Knightley), now a young woman.  He tells her who he is and she tells him that he is dead and the date on which he died.  It turns out that is less than a week away in Jack's "present."  With each visit to the morgue drawer, and to the future, Jack is able to find out more information that he can use.  Becker is not to be trusted, but Dr. Lorenson (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is sympathetic, even if she does not believe he is traveling in time.  As he learns about his limited future from Jackie he also learns what happens to her in the future, and that becomes part of the calculus as he tries to avoid dying a second time.<br /><br />In retrospect I seem to like more intimate time travel stories than those that try to rewrite history in a way that would change everything in the world in which we live.  In that regard "The Jacket" is not great, but it is still pretty good and once you accept the premise ends up being a lot more satisfactory than a lot of films in this genre I have seen recently.  It is ironic that Knightley did the movie to avoid being stuck in corsets for the next two decades while Brody is starting to find himself in a niche as the most mournful face on the big screen since, oh, I do not know, let us say Stan Laurel (How is that for a reach?).  On this DVD you will find that the project history and deleted scenes featurette is pretty interesting, and includes a different cut of the film's love scene that is an excellent example of montage (suggesting rather than seeing is a good thing in such instances).</p></body></html>

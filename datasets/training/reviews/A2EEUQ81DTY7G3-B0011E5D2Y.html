The silly but cheerful John (Wilson) and fast-talking and manipulative Jeremy (Vaughn) have adopted an annual ritual of going randomly to weddings under assumed names in order to have a good time, picking up unattached women for quick, no-commitment trysts.<br /><br />For them it's all about the sex, drinking, and the rock and roll as they ply their trade at ceremonies of various faiths and ethnic backgrounds. Along the way the champagne flows and they get to meet lots of sexually voracious and beautiful young girls. Lately, however, their hedonistic life seems to be catching up with them - this particular season has been particularly exhausting, but when they discover that high powered Defense Secretary Cleary (Christopher Walken) is having a bash for his older daughter Claire (Rachel McAdams), they cannot resist attending.<br /><br />John falls for Claire, but unfortunately Claire already has a fianc&eacute;, in the form of the smarmy and not-very-nice-preppie Sack (Bradley Cooper). Meanwhile, Jeremy finds himself stuck with Cleary's youngest daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher), who's a real spitfire, and who mistakenly tells Jeremy that she's a virgin after they both have a quickie on the beach. When Gloria gets her father to invite the boys for a weekend at the Cleary holiday home, they discover that this family is more dysfunctional than they realized.<br /><br />The Secretary's alcoholic wife Kathleen (Jane Seymour) comes on to John, while foul-mouthed grandma (Ellen Albertini Dow) verbally assaults everyone, and spews homophobic jokes at the dinner table, especially to artist grandson Todd (Keir O'Donnell), who in turn visits Jeremy's room to make a pass at him at the very time when the poor fellow has been literally tied to his guest bed by the voracious Gloria.<br /><br />There's no doubt that the Wedding Crashers is punctuated with some funny moments, but the film is ultimately hampered by an overall sloppiness of execution and direction. It isn't nearly as funny as it should be, with the long running jokes eventually wearing thin, and the comedic elements failing to sit easily with the love story between John and Claire.  The film also drags the setup scenario on for far too long and the whole film over extends itself by about thirty minutes.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this film, however, is that it fails to be funny when it starts to take itself too seriously. In the labored third act, when its ne'er-do-well heroes inevitably go soft and redeem themselves - and a predictable and overrated guest star appears to offer an extraordinarily tiresome cameo - one gets the feeling that it's all just degenerated into a lurching, lumpy, semi-improvised sketch comedy. By movie's end one hopes that the boys contrived search for redemption should be wrapped up as quickly as possible, but here it's prolonged to such length that the movie threatens never to end.<br /><br />Vince Vaughan is a talented and funny actor, but in this movie he borders on irritating, and Owen Wilson, although somewhat sweet, would have to be one of the most innocuously untalented actors working today. Their back-and-forth frat-boy bickering is amusing for twenty minutes or so, but then steadily becomes annoying. Sloppily, directed by David Dobkin we watch John and Jeremy as they banter, crash, lie, banter, and then crash again until it all becomes a bit repetitive and stale.<br /><br />The veterans suffer too, especially Jane Seymour who ultimately has little to do. She literally has one of the best and funniest scenes in the film, yet her character is absolutely wasted; the producers could have made so much more of her. And then there's Walken as Secretary Cleary, who's portrayed as a hot presidential prospect, but quickly turns into an unrealistic dolt.<br /><br />I guess you could wrap up the Wedding Crashers by saying that it's sporadically amusing but like most weddings it generally flags in enthusiasm towards the end and the final scenes are as predictable as they are characteristically unwelcome. If viewers want to see a good, bawdy comedy that sustains the humor until the end, they should take a look at The Forty-Year-Old Virgin instead. Mike Leonard January 06.</p></body></html>

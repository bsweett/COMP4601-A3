<meta name="summary" content=""That Is What They Do, Not Who They Are" ~ Romance, Bad Guys And Muffins Of Mass Destruction"></head><body><p>I was somewhat hesitant to take the time to watch the '08 remake of the 60's comedy television series `Get Smart'. To be honest, I wasn't a big fan of the show growing up even though I watched it (there wasn't a lot to choice from back then). With that in mind I wondered if I really wanted to listen to all the rehashed lines and view all the 60's comedy routines that the 60's television series was known for. However I do enjoy Steve Carell and Dwayne "the Rock"  Johnson so I decided to go ahead and spend the quality time with my wife and daughter and take the chance.<br /><br />I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised with what I saw. While the film remained true to the spirit of the original series there was more than enough original thinking infused into the movie to allow the film to be enjoyed on its own merit without being nothing more than a tribute piece of cinema. There were loads of laughs, some superior physical comedy sequences (love the dance-off), smart dialogue (yes, I said smart) and consistent energy from beginning to end.  Maybe it's not destined to be a classic, but certainly a film the whole family can enjoy.<br /><br />My Rating: -3 ? Stars-.</p></body></html>

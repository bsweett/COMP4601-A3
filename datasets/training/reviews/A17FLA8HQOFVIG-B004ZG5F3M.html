It appeals to all ages, includes comedy, drama and romance and leaves you smiling when it's over. Not only that - it has a good story too.<br /><br />Set in a village in France, it's the story of a woman and her daughter who set up a chocolate shop.  The leading citizens of the town are horrified because not only does this woman not go to church, she also opens her shop right in the middle of Lent. The leading citizen of the town tries to show how immoral she is.  But, little by little, the woman worms her way into the hearts of the townspeople and not only wins them all over, she finds romance as well.<br /><br />Nominated for several academy awards, there are only good things to say about this film.  Jullette Binoche is cast as the chocolate shop woman and I adored her immediately.  Judi Dench is cast as her landlady who goes to the shop for comfort because her own daughter has turned against her.  Alfred Molina is the town leader and he sure is comical.  Johnny Depp is the romantic interest, a "river rat" who comes to the town to play music.  And in the end, everyone lives happily ever after.<br /><br />Even I, who usually prefer films on the dark side, was enchanted.<br /><br />Don't miss this film.  You'll love it.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

Perhaps I'm being premature in arguing that this graphic novel about a rich but soulless young man in the throes of materialistic excess ranks alongside such monumental novels as Sinclair Lewis's "Main Street" or Theodore Dreiser's "An American Tragedy," but that's exactly what I am saying. I predict that the coming decades will see Ellis's novel elevated to the pantheon of great American literature, a novel so indicative of its time and place that future generations will read it in order to gain insight into certain segments of our culture. Like other great novels about the American experience, "American Psycho" doesn't cover all the bases--America is too diverse for a single author to capture its total essence in a single novel. But what it does touch upon strikes at a central tenet of our society, namely our greed for things and our inability to strike a balance between laissez-faire capitalism and regulated market systems. We learned in the 1980s that "Greed is good." Ellis's novel shows us how that greed taken to its farthest extension is anything but good.<br /><br />Predictably, someone made a film based on the book--a director named Mary Harron to be exact--starring Christian Bale as the titular psycho Patrick Bateman. Pat seems to have everything the American dream promises: good looks, money, a good lineage, an ivy league education, beautiful women, nice digs, all the accoutrements that come with being a member of the American social elite. He is also, according to his own observations, a raving lunatic prone to outbursts of horrific violence. The smallest incidents cause our anti-hero to embark on epic excursions of bloody mayhem, from a colleague producing a better business card than the ones Patrick carries to a homeless man on the street who has the temerity to ask for money. He has a propensity to blurt out the most outrageous statements to his equally slick pals and numerous girlfriends, statements about heads on sticks and how he works in "murders and executions," but no one seems to notice or care that much. Even more amazing, no one seems to notice Patrick Bateman lapsing into murderous insanity. But why would they? He's one of them, one of the cream of the crop, and is certainly not the sort of scoundrel who would murder and maim harridans, business associates, or anyone else who happens to cross his path.<br /><br />In fact, we can never be entirely sure the murders and tortures are reality or just figments of Bateman's fragmented and vacuous personality. More likely these egregious acts, acts which include chasing a woman around an apartment building with a chainsaw or burying an axe in the noggin of an associate named Paul Allen (Jared Leto), represent attempts to feel something beyond the mere superficiality provided by material goods. Then again, maybe not. A cop named Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe) does turn up at Bateman's office from time to time to inquire about the whereabouts of the aforementioned Allen. It's to the film's credit that we can never quite say for sure if Bateman is responsible for all of these atrocities, but that is also the conclusion we reach with the book. What we know for certain is how useless this guy's life really is. All he does is show up for work so he can goof off, listen to music, try and obtain reservations at the latest hip restaurants, and exercise. He's really nothing and he knows it. Watching these yuppies preen and prance through expensive set pieces evokes an equally useless class of do-nothings, i.e. the European nobility of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Come to think of it, some of those barons, dukes, and earls engaged in mass murder as well.<br /><br />The only problem I had with the film version of "American Psycho" isn't really a major problem at all. In order to get a rating that would allow theaters to show the picture, Harron had to tone down the gore considerably. The book is loaded with stomach churning descriptions of Bateman's atrocities that only get worse as his insanity increases. Even an unrated version of the film couldn't begin to bring to the screen many of these nightmares, but that's o.k. What we do get is highly disturbing thanks largely to the marvelous skills of actor Christian Bale in the lead role. In a film loaded with talent--including Chloe Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, Jared Leto, Josh Lucas, and Willem Dafoe--Bale easily holds his own and then some as the savage psychotic. His voiceovers describing his inner sensations send chills down the spine yet he's equally at ease with the book's black humor. It's amazing there are times you won't know whether you should laugh or shriek in terror at Bateman's latest escapade. If you haven't read the book, which I recommend before watching the film, you might need to view the picture several times to absorb the bleak social commentary.<br /><br />Extras on the disc include production notes, cast biographies, a trailer, an interview with Bale, and a making of featurette. I'll leave you with a typical Bateman statement: "There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone, in fact I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape, but even after admitting this there is no catharsis, my punishment continues to elude me, and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself. No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing." Enough said, eh?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Movie and a Time not to FORGET"></head><body><p>This was probably one of the toughest movies I've had to review. There are tremendous emotions portrayed here and without question will bring tears to your eyes. It isn't a 5 star movie, and it isn't a 2 star movie. I mean, you could give it 4 stars out of sympathy and respect for the people portrayed in the film, and that would be the only reason I would give it 4 stars.<br /><br />The movie is about 2 port authority officers who were pulled from the rubble after 9/11, their families & their ordeal. It doesn't cover the whole event like you might think. In the film, it's interesting to see how they found themselves under the rubble and how they kept themselves alive. It's interesting to see the world from their vantage point, yards beneath the piles of medal and concrete.<br /><br />So, where does WORLD TRADE CENTER fall short for me?<br /><br />It may be unfair to compare, but I watched UNITED 93 about a week before and it was by far, a superior film. After watching UNITED 93, and seeing the mostly unknown actors knock it out of the park, I was taken by the OUTSTANDING realism and the attention to detail. When you looked at the actors portraying the real life victims in the film, you saw the real life victims, not the actors. The anonimity of the unknown actors brought a sense of realism to the project.<br /><br />That brings me to WORLD TRADE CENTER. As the movie began to unfold, I caught myself thinking like this.... "Hey, that's Maria Bello. She was in HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. She was hot in COYOTE UGLY. There's Nicholas Cage. Jesus, is he in everything? I wonder when GHOST RIDER is coming out? Who's that guy... oh, yeah, he was in CRASH and MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Oh, yeah, and that's the guy from CRAZY/BEAUTIFUL. Man, there's a lot of stars in this. That's the kid from TITANIC, Leo's friend, Danny Nucci. Ooh, that's Maggie Gyllenhaal. I like her. SECRETARY was good. Her brothers Jake. Oh yeah. That's Stephen Dorff... where's he been? Oh, wow, is that Frank Whaley? Man, where's he been. I remember him from like CAREER OPPORTUNITES. Ooh, wasn't he the guy that gave Sam Jackson his big gulp in PULP FICTION? That's the guy from LOST. The other who posed as a crash victim."<br /><br />To put this point into a shorter prose: the recognizable actors throughout the film were a COMPLETE DISTRACTION. Watching these actors ACT was distracting. It came across too Hollywood to me. The watching through a time window effect that was so amazingly captured by UNITED 93 was NOT at all captured by WORLD TRADE CENTER. It came across like actors portraying someone.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage, one of the most recognizeable stars today, played real life port authority officer John McLoughlin, and it felt like a Hollywood movie and that to me, doomed it. WORLD TRADE CENTER deserved better. When you're looking at these REAL personalities, like McLoughlin & Will Jimeno, you don't want to see big hollywood star Nicholas Cage & the guy from Crash, you want to see the men they're portraying.<br /><br />I don't want to be too harsh on the film. It is a good film, and as much as I hate to say it, I wanted to be brought back to that day. I wanted to be reminded of what happened, like we all should every year, so we never forget why and who did this. I was reminded, but the constant bombardment of recognizable actors kept me from completely being sucked into the film.</p></body></html>

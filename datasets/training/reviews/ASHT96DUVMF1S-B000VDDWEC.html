<meta name="summary" content="The new Zombie Must See"></head><body><p>28 days was a refreshing movie. Many times the apocalyptic view has been funny.  Showing us our social degradation built upon forges made in technology was truly amazing.  In today&#65533;s world apocalyptic views have taken on a new fear.  The idea of a virus that can kill those around you by turning them into a zombie is horrifying. 28 Days Later may turn into the sleeper hit of the summer.  ...  You can always tell how well a movie was liked once it is over and you are walking out.  Everyone was extremely quiet.  It seemed the movie had touched a nerve.<br />For months I turned away from the commercials for 28 Days Later as I usual do when an interesting movie trailer begins broadcasting. It&#65533;s because many times the trailers convey a different idea or show all the interesting parts spoiling the experience. This situation was an excellent decision.  I had no idea what to expect.  All the actors are relatively unknown but are great. The grainy texture was a lack of funds but works great to add another dimension especially thriller/horror films.  It&#65533;s few and far between that movies come out like this. It reminds me of Halloween.  All the actors were unknown and the film grossed nothing the first weeks only to grow as the great horror movie every filmed.  This is a must see.  Go to 28 Days Later before wasting your money on the Hulk or Reloaded.</p></body></html>

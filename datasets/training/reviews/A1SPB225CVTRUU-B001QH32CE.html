<meta name="summary" content=""Start Fresh, Jenna.""></head><body><p>Waitress is surprisingly funny, charming, delicious, and even moving at times. It's about a depressed, discontended waitress named Jenna(Keri Russell) dealing with her daily mundane job at pie shop and her abusive husband, and how she faces new challenges and a romance with a married doctor when she unintentionally became pregnant. Jenna is very unhappy woman and a very good baker. She plans to secretly save up enough money and enter a national pie baking contest and run away from her nasty husband. Her two coworkers at the pie shop are good friends and supportive to her, and they also have their share of unhappy romanctic encounters. Jenna's life becomes more chaotic when she has an affair with the local doctor whom she thought might actually be an ideal future husband material, but nothing is what it it seems sometimes. Jenna befriends her regular customer Old Joe(Andy Griffith) who is also the shop owner, and eventually this wise old man becomes her advisor when things get ugly at home with her husband. Will Jenna stay home after giving birth to the baby, and continue to be miserable? Or will she run away with the doctor and start a new life? Or does she have other options....?<br /><br />This is a very charming film and the characters have plenty of funny moments to work with. It's highly entertaining and I was very taken by Keri Russel's performances. The supporting cast all turned in strong performances. I thought the Adrianne Shelly who played the fellow waitress and her funny boyfriend had the funniest moment in the movie. The ending was kind of predictable but I also thought it had built up for the audiences to expect to see a second ending which I won't reveal.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Epic Look At Last Days Of The Third Reich"></head><body><p>Within the orbit of the "sturm und drang' universe that was the twelve year reign of the Third Reich, almost nothing was excessive, not even the maniacal gesticulations of the Little Corporal, Adolph Hitler, whose final days in the enveloping holocaust that was Berlin in April of 1945. In "Downfall" we are treated to a disagreeable dollop of desperately demented degenerates in an absolutely riveting look at just how fantastic and solipsistic the worldview of the Nazis was. Even as the Gotterdammerung explodes around them, Hitler fancies a meal of Cheese ravioli even as his eating companions dither.<br /><br />Hitler was nothing if not megalomaniacal; yet there was method to his madness, for the Soviet Union was indeed literally moving heaven and earth to discover and destroy him. Yet his almost whimsical last-ditch efforts to resurrect the smashed Wehrmacht to rescue him and win the day are fascinating to see recreated so powerfully and sometimes poetically here, and it helps one to better understand the malignant and molevolent motive force behind the mass movement that left mega-millions of dead and even more ruined lives in its fateful wake.<br /><br />The movie strikes a fascinating counterpoint between the social dramas of the siege of Berlin around with the more personal drama of what is happening within the bunker itself. In so doing, it breathes life into Hannah Arendt's fascinating comment about the ultimate banality of evil. After all, these were human beings struggling to survive within the concrete confines of the bunker, however tortured, conflicted and self-interested. To recognize this is to better comprehend just how petty and mundane their lives were in these most fatal final hous of their miserable existence, worrying as they did about making coffee and smoking cigarettes while their very world was being smashed into smithereens above them.<br /><br />The movie is multi-layered and quite sophisticated, and pointedly makes no effort to reach for the lowest common denominator in judging Hitler and his entourage, offering no drive-by facile answers while painfully and graphically exploring the excruciatingly caustic world of the Third Reich in its last painful death throes. Instead, we are reminded that the Fuhrer was as much a social phenomenon as he was an individual, and it was as much the fault of the average German who followed his charismatic lead as the devil himself who created the circumstance for the greatest tragedy of the 20th century. This may not be a movie you will really enjoy, but it is one we can all profit from seeing!</p></body></html>

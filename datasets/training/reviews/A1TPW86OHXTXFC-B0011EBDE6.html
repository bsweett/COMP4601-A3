This shaggy-dog road trip, in which three semi-estranged brothers travel by rail across India, is unstintingly fussy, vain and self-regarding. But it is also a treasure: an odd, flawed, but nonetheless beautifully handmade object as apt to win affection as to provoke annoyance. You might say that it has sentimental value." AO Scott<br /><br />Surrounded by the vision of India, we find two brothers joining the third on a voyage across India. Frank, played by Owen Wilson, has convened the group to bond, as they once did. Frank has his head and face swathed in bandages, after he tried to "off" himself by running his motorcycle into a tree. Their father died a year ago, their mother left then to join a convent,  and we are left to wonder 'what is this all about'?  Adrian Brody plays Peter, and he wears his father's sunglasses, and tells his brothers that their father loved him best. Jason Schwartman plays Jack, the youngest and the one who loves the  sweet lime and the sweet women.<br /><br />So, here they are, each of them with several pairs of Louis Vuitton baggage left by their father, traipsing across India trying to loosen and leave their virtual baggage behind. They travel by train until they so annoy the Indian conductor he throws them off. Then by foot and taxi, off they go. We learn a little bit about each of them. They meet up with their mother who has become a nun in a monastery, and there they try to unload their emotions. She listens but apparently it doesn' take. Frank tries to let go of his scars. Peter tells them his girlfriend is about to deliver a son, and he is confused about it all. Jack breaks into his ex-girlfriends voice mail and relishes what he learns.  All in all a melancholy trip, a humorous trip and a compelling trip. I found the films a little on the weird side, but I could not stop watching. What was going to occur next? We never  know what is around the corner- it keeps us off-guard.  Did the brothers achieve their goal? The layers of emotion come undone in a way when they confront their mother, the nun, played by Angelica Houston, in a role like none other.<br /><br />"The movie meanders. It will therefore inspire reviews complaining that it doesn't fly straight as an arrow at its target. But it doesn't have a target, either. Why do we have to be the cops and enforce a narrow range of movie requirements? Anderson is like Dave Brubeck, who I'm listening to right now. He knows every note of the original song, but the fun and genius come in the way he noodles around. And in his movie's cast, especially with Owen Wilson, Anderson takes advantage of champion noodlers." Roger Ebert<br /><br />Jack, the youngest listens on his IPod to a song that will stay with you throughout the movie and swirl around your head. The song by Peter Sarstedt 'Where Do You Go To My Lovely?" It is a lilting, catchy song that resonates with me.<br /><br />'But where do you go to my lovely<br />When you're alone in your bed<br />Tell me the thoughts that surround you<br />I want to look inside your head'<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 05-13-08<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024JC30">The Big Bounce (Widescreen Edition)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLT5">The Pianist</a></p></body></html>

This time, we are treated to more action, new characters and a visually pleasing film that doesn't disappoint.  While some characters have been scaled back in the story line (such as Cyclops and Rogue), this movie gives us more of Storm and her ability to control weather, young X men in training, Iceman and Pyro, and the Xavier-like Jean Gray.  Villains held over from the previous film are Mystique, whose role also expanded in this film and Magneto, played by the always talented Ian McCellan. Bryan Singer did a good job of juggling the meagerie of mutant characters under the care of Dr. Xavier.  I also like how he exhibits the theme of being an outsider in the movie, such as the one scene in which Bobby (Iceman) returns home.  The scene has Iceman "coming out" to his parents and revealing the dreadful news that he is a mutant.  It plays like a young man revealing his homosexuality to his parents and shows the broader scope of the theme of exclusion felt by the mutants to the rest of human society.  The most interesting new addition is Nightcrawler, played perfectly by the charming actor, Alan Cumming.  The scenes with Nightcrawler transporting are extremely well done and I hope we learn more about the blue skinned mutant in the next film.  The story line with Wolverine continues with some resolution but leaves plenty of information in the dark for the inevitable sequel.  There is a death in the film that I felt was unnecessary--I won't say who--but it would have been interesting to see this character return.  However, with the number of heroes and villains in the world of the X Men, there are plenty of new characters to choose from for the next movie. If you haven't seen the first film, you might want to check it out before seeing this one, although it isn't completely necessary.  There is enough interesting things going on in this movie to keep your attention and make you a fan of this group of heroes.  The ending also hints at things to come in the next film (for one hero in particular), making me eager to see the next one and dreading the wait for it to appear in theaters!  Make a trip to your local theater for this popcorn flick...you will not be disappointed!</p></body></html>

Picking up where the last movie left off (and I'm not going to regale you with what the Matrix is about, because if you haven't seen either of the other movies, you really have no business watching "Revolutions"), the humans' hidden city of Zion faces certain annihilation by the "Machine Army".  <p>(Okay - in a distant future, a civilization of intelligent machines enslaves almost all humanity, using human bio-energy to power themselves; the unfortunate humans who are born and ultimately die while tapped by the machines remain oblivious to their fate because their consciousness remains trapped in a vast virtual reality known as "The Matrix"; the first flick taught us how existence their was split between the consciousness  of those imprisoned there and AI programs who kept order; "Reloaded" added an interesting spin - rather than just an Us (humans) against them (Machines outside the Matrix and AI programs on the inside) AI programs were depicted as sophisticated, able to mathematically deduce what were seemingly human feelings of love, lust, frustration, dissension and regret.  We met the Merovingian - an almost god-like program who reconstructed himself as a Francophiliac philosopher of free choice; the "Keymaker" an obsolete program who doesn't let his impending destruction keep him from making keys for doors meant to remain locked, and pointing the way for those lost; we also found out that the enigmatic "Oracle" was herself a high-level program; and we finally met the architect himself.  Rather then merely single-mindedly enslave and exploit us, these bits of heavyweight AI waxed with surprising intelligence on free choice.<p>At the end of the last movie, Neo (Reeves) learned from the Architect that he was not destined by fate to save mankind from the machines - but actually chosen by the machines to fulfill his role in their order in which Zion is repeatedly created and then destroyed (the machines, being essentially equation-crunching computers, thrive on predictable patterns;  it's our free choice, not just our freedom, that sets us apart from the machines).  Though the machines are assured of their victory over the humans, they've got problems of their own - namely the AI program Agent Smith (Weaving).  Once only a cog in the Matrix whom we thought destroyed by Neo in "The Matrix", we learnt in "Reloaded" that only his connection to the AI was destroyed, but Smith himself not only remained in existence, but found the power to turn others in the Matrix into clones of himself.  By the end of "Reloaded", Smith was able to make the biggest jump of all - cloning himself onto one of Zion's agents and leaping into the next world in the body of a human.  In "Revolutions", the humans face an awesome attack by the machines.  Neo and Trinity fight to reach the main AI at the center of the machines' city while Morpheus and Niobe race time and a fleet of the Machines' sentinels to reach their own.  Meanwhile, within the Matrix itself, Smith consolidates his power by cloning everything into himself.<p>"Revolutions" is very much a mixed bag - the metaphysics and plotlines developed in the first two movies are not entirely served by the comparatively abrupt ending.  Also, the plot separates characters who should remain together - Trinity joins Neo on his futile journey to the machines because that plays up the romance angle of the flick, but shouldn't it be Morpheus who goes along?  (Before Trinity fell in love with Neo, it was Morpheus who believed in him, and it was Morpheus's faith that was shattered at the end of "Reloaded" - what better way, in a story about predestination and free-choice, to develop a character than by showing it acting first on perceived fate, then by free-choice?  So Trinity and Neo have their romantic moment while Morpheus &amp; Niobe are nearly drowned by clouds of CGI-rendered Sentinels).  That aside, "Revolutions" is still an adrenaline-soaked feast for the eyes, one that pushes the boundaries of what you can show, even in wide-screen format.  The climactic attack on Zion - in which humans battle clouds of sentinels, and mammoth drill robots, easily outstrips the lame all-CGI battles of the last "Star Wars" movies (it's sort of a mix between "Starship Troopers" and Tolkein).  For a CGI fest, "Revolutions" leans heavily on some very human FX - Morpheus is still loveable for his pseudo-zen koans, while Hugo Weaving's deadpan delivery will keep him as cinema's most chillingly convincing manifestation of artificial intelligence.  Also, special kudos to Ian Bliss, a human who becomes Smith's vessel in the "real" world, and gives us all a valuable how-to-sound-like-Hugo Weaving lesson.  If you want a nice and tidy story, go watch "Star Trek".  For a more complicated ride, plug into the Matrix.</p></body></html>

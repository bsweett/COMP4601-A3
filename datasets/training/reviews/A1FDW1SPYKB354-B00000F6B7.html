<meta name="summary" content="By Far The Best Of The Star Trek Films!"></head><body><p>This second of now several Star Trek motion pictures, in my opinion, is the best of the lot!  Lots of great action is in store for the Enterprise &amp; crew in this 1982 space adventure!  Ricardo Montalban is excellent as the main bad guy, Khan, resurrecting his role from the TV series.  Any Trek fan will love this picture!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Very Good Film"></head><body><p>AvP is every bit as good as the previous films. What did everybody expect, Sigourney Weaver and a very fake robot? That truly is the only difference. This film is excellent. It is a very good mix of Stargate, the Mummy, Alien, and Predator.<br /><br />This film is FULL of suspense. That scene in the camp with the Preadators gave me the shivers. It is also very surprising, and intense. I won't tell you too much, but let's just say the one lady left with a gun "and in this case an ally" is used once again.<br /><br />See it, and let yourself get into it. Don't be skeptical please.</p></body></html>

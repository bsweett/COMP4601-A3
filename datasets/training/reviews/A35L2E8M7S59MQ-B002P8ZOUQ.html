In short:  The movie is a simple, soulless action movie that really doesn't give justice to its primary characters.  No character ever has a chance to develop a distinct personality, and we only understand Logan because of the fact that he has been a key player in three other films.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is a wonderful, very promising actor who is somewhat typecast as Wolverine at this point -somewhat sad since he's had many better performances- but he never is really given a chance to display his acting talent a single time in this film.  This movie is a rock'em sock'em with no point to it other than the filmmakers wondering how many action scenes they can jam pack into its short running time.<br /><br />The point of the film seemed to be someone asking "How many mutants can we stuff into a single X-Men movie?" and then they just went from there.  Instead of actually giving us a chance to learn more about the character of Wolverine we end up with 90-minutes of pure action and zero in the way of character development.<br /><br />Now I know summer movies are supposed to be big, dumb fun, but when we had two great movies (X-Men, X2) building up this film's title character the result is his origin isn't nearly as interesting, or exciting as those films would have lead us to believe.<br /><br />The film is built on clich&eacute;s and has no interesting characters.  I would recommend skipping this film if you want to preserve the mystery of the Wolverine character you were given in the first films, because this "Origin Story" is bound to seriously disappoint you.  And even if you're seeking a mindless action movie I would recommend renting this movie because it is not worth anything more than five-dollars.</p></body></html>

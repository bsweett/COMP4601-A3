The opening scene is effective in the suspense and sense of dread leading to the tragic event that kicks off this round of "cheating death". I don't particularly enjoy roller coasters myself, so this scene was rather disturbing, but it was done well.<br /><br />There are some nasty death scenes in this movie. I mean, it's nothing like a movie such as "Hostel", but the gratuitousness of the deaths almost don't seem to fit into what would otherwise remind you of a movie like "Clueless". They are creative, though. You are warned that something nasty is about to happen by the tone of the scene, yet you may still not be quite ready for it when it happens.<br /><br />The acting is better than I would have expected. I doubt any awards will be handed out for these performances, but I'm sure that wasn't the intention, anyway. I must say that I enjoyed this movie more than I was expecting to and I would recommend it.</p></body></html>

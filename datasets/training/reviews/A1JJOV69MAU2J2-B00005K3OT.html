<meta name="summary" content="A magical confection of a movie..."></head><body><p>First off, Chocolat is a metaphor -- a metaphor for thinking in new ways, trying new things, renewing the human spirit, enjoying life and salving deep emotional wounds. On that level the movie works wonderfully well, with Juliet Binoche giving a marvelously subtle performance that balances her character on the edge of vulnerability while exuding confidence.<p>Some windy sourpusses reviewing this simple, wonderful and heartwarming tale (How many of those does Hollywood put out a year? Two, three?) seem to focus on The Horror that the main character tempts townspeople with chocolate during Lent, and therefore it is anti-Catholic. Those arguments are simply silly dreck. It's not anti-Catholic, it's anti-dogma and pro-tolerance and pro-living. I suppose those reviewers would be happy if the townsfolk had burned the woman at the stake for being different and a veritable magician!<p>Unless you will be offended by temptation (in which case you shouldn't see ANY movie), you will find Chocolat a delicious treat.</p></body></html>

The cast is superb, with Sean Penn offering a perfect performance of power and grace, humor and courage. James Franco does a wonderful understated calm performance as Scott Smith, the lover who follows Harvey to San Francisco and emotionally supports him during his rocky rise in the local political scene. Gus Van Sant may have been the perfect director for this script since he is sensitive to the subtle dynamics and evolution of the gay rights movement while also making a credible effort to explore the character of Harvey Milk and his lovers. The film reminds us of the terrible violence and discrimination those in the gay community experienced from the police, media, and courts.  This reference back to these days of harassment and attacks is important in grounding the work and philosophy of Harvey Milk. Placing this story within the history of the Castro neighborhood in San Francisco helps give the narrative a time and place as well as makes reference to a major social movement. The historic films, including the films of Anita Bryant's bigoted campaign against gay men and women, give all viewers a feel for the hatred, bigotry, violence, discrimination, and lack of civil rights that gay men and women experienced. The film is very educational in that it firmly places gay rights as in the same group with civil rights for African Americans and women. Yet Harvey Milk is a critical piece of this history, not just as an activist but also as the first open gay person elected to public office in the United States. Harvey Milk is fully characterized as a multi-dimensional, resilient, courageous, transcendent human being. His resiliency, as portrayed by Sean Penn, is inspiring. Milk had a broad and objective view of the condition of gay men and women in the United States and the political skills to move forward in the fight against discrimination. He loses a handsome young lover in his political fights and then adopts a damaged soul as his second lover. It is the loving, protective way that Harvey loves and supports his emotionally and mentally fragile lover that echoes his love and protection for all of those in the gay movement.  In other words, Harvey was willing to take a partner who was damaged goods, and in so doing, personifies his philosophy that the gay community is full of persons who are damaged and deserve protection. Harvey loses three consecutive elections but finally with his vision and resiliency, he prevails and is elected to the San Francisco board of supervisors.  The rise and tragic fall of Harvey Milk makes for wonderfully moving drama, even more penetrating, because it reflects a significant time in our history.</p></body></html>

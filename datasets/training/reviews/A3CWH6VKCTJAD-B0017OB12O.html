<meta name="summary" content="A timeless classic"></head><body><p>This film is a giant in a very crowded genre of WWII movies released in the 1940's and 50's.  It was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won seven including Best Picture, Best Actor (Alec Guinness) and Best Director (David Lean).  The story is atypical of the WWII genre.  Instead of showing the glory of battle, it presents the psychological and physical torment of life in a POW camp.  It focuses on the human story, a story of principles, will and courage in the face of adversity.<p>Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) is the commander of a group of prisoners of war interned in a Japanese camp in Southeast Asia during WWII.  He is told by the camp commander, Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) that the prisoners will build a bridge across the river Kwai to complete the Japanese railroad that will supply their troops.  Saito orders that officers will work beside enlisted men, to which Nicholson objects because it is a violation of the rules of war agreed to at the Geneva Convention.  This leads to a standoff, a test of wills that is ultimately won by the irrationally stubborn Brit after many days in solitary confinement.<p>The result is that Nicholson agrees to build the bridge on his own terms, using his own engineers.  This seems to be insane, since building the bridge would aid the enemy.  However, Nicholson's has a high-minded goal that transcends the war.  He wants to build a bridge that will endure as a testament to the superiority of the British civilization, especially since it will be built under such extreme circumstances.  He also feels that building a bridge of which they can be proud will boost the moral of the men while living under such oppressive conditions.<p>The psychological aspect of the film is fascinating.  Saito's personal sense of honor does not allow him to use the brutality necessary to coerce the prisoners into building the bridge properly.  Ironically, once he succumbs to defeat in the battle of wills against Nicholson, he gets everything he wants.  By losing, he actually wins.<p>David Lean's direction is outstanding, portraying the harshness of the prison camp without sacrificing the subtlety of the psychological aspect of the film.  Lean gives us enough character development to bind us to all the competing characters, making us sympathetic even to Saito, the camp commander.  <p>The acting in this film is superb.  Alec Guinness is magnificent as the idealistic and staunchly principled Colonel.  This was probably his best role in a stellar career.  William Holden is also terrific as the sardonic and cowardly sailor that fate continued to throw into situations that required him to become a reluctant hero.  Sessue Hayakawa delivers a masterful performance, as the hapless commander who succumbs to Nicholson's iron will.<p>The ending evokes conflicting emotions, as it is simultaneously ironic, triumphant and devastating.  At the end, the viewer is not sure whom to pull for since there is no neat way to resolve the collision of converging forces.  This makes the film even more interesting.<p>This film is a timeless classic.  I rated it a 10/10.  I'm looking forward to seeing it on the newly released DVD.</p></body></html>

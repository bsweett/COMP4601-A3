<meta name="summary" content="Devilishly Good!"></head><body><p>For the person who has suffered working for a boss from hell, he or she can relate to Andy, a recent college graduate who takes a job with the world's most famous fashion magazine, Runway, to get a year of experience under her belt.  Unknowningly, the doe-eyed, fashion-challenged young lady walks into the lair of the devil, Miranda Priestly.  Taking a job in a field she knows nothing about certainly does nothing to impress the vicious and EXTREMELY demanding Miranda, who chews her assistants up and spits them out on a regular basis.<br /><br />From the start, Andy is fighting an uphill battle.  Slowly, however, with the help of Nigel, one of Miranda's right hand men, who has not lost his soul while working for his evil boss, she decides to change and throw all her effort into pleasing Miranda.  Aided by Nigel, Andy slowly emerges as a fashionable, young assistant proving that she is capable of handling any of Miranda's insane and nearly impossible demands.  However, she soons begins to realize that her job is consuming her life and destroying her relationship with friends and her boyfriend, Nate.  The question that she eventually faces, is how far will she will go with her demanding job---to the top or abandon the normal life she enjoyed with her loved ones.<br /><br />I read this book and enjoyed it and was delighted to hear that Meryl Streep would play Miranda.  And while the book is told through Andy's eyes, Miranda is the person you can't look away from and this is the deliciously evil kind of role that any actress would enjoy playing.  It is no surprise that Meryl tackles it with amazing ease and oozes an aura of iciness that would freeze you in your spot.  Without raising her voice, she simply slices you down with a pointed sentence that cuts deeper than daggers or simply gives a look of disgust that makes you want to throw up your lunch---in these girls' cases, that would be a miracle since they eat almost nothing.  At any rate, I would love to see Meryl get a nomination for this role because she simply MAKES the movie.<br /><br />Anne Hathway is a great choice for Andy and your heart certainly goes out to her.  Whether she is trying to get Miranda's hot coffee or trying to get her hands on the manuscript for the latest Harry Potter novel, you feel the dread along with the character as she brings her tasks to the disapproving eyes of Ms. Priestly.  Stanley Tucci also does a great job as Nigel, who takes her under his wing and gives her the chops to make it in the halls of Runway.<br /><br />For those who read the book, you will not be disappointed.  And for anyone who is a fan of Meryl Streep, this is a movie you will want to see (and later own on dvd).  For those who love fashion, of course, this will be right down your alley!  But for all of us who know how bad a mean boss can be, you will sympathize!  Well worth your time and money!</p></body></html>

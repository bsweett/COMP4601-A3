<meta name="summary" content="Fair follow-up to dynamite original"></head><body><p>The Transporter 2 is a fair movie, but it really misses on the things that made the original so darn unique.<br /><br />Frank Martin was an enigma in the original. He spoke little, but his actions spoke more than any words could.<br /><br />The original was sparse and had a decidedly European feel to in, including its funky weird soundtrack. The action was heavy and wild, but it was also somewhat believable.<br /><br />In the sequel, Frank Martin (compared to the first film) is almost chatty. He's a kinder gentler version of the first film's lead. He's a glorified babysitter this time out. It's more touchy feely than cold steel.<br /><br />The action is top notch, but I found myself laughing rather than being excited, since so much of it was quite ludicrous. Yes, it was fun to watch the chroeographed fight scenes, but they were so "rehearsed" that they actually jolted me out of the cinematic suspension of disbelief into "oh, this isn't remotely possible".<br /><br />I'm going to lay the blame on the director, the writer, and cinematographer for most of this films ills. Set in Miami Beach, this film is shot in very lush greens that exude the whole "tropical" appeal of the area. Unfortunately, it also takes away from the starkness that the first film provided.<br /><br />Babysitting...Hulk Hogan did it. Vin Diesel did it. So why not Jason Statham? Nope. I don't buy it. Statham is completely different than either of the others. He's never been larger than life. The actor and his personnae have always been less than large - intentionally: Snatch, Transporter 1, The Italian Job...but now this?<br /><br />Statham is the modern day Jean Claude Van Damme, only better. Statham can act.<br /><br />It is his performance alone that warrants the three stars I've given the film.<br /><br />I hope his next outing is more deserving of his time.</p></body></html>

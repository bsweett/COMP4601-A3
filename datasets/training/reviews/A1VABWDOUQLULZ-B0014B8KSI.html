That said, his role in this film is well played.  I thought the plot slipped in a place or two, although in the rearview it held together pretty well.  The direction the story takes is not incredibly obvious, but the fear of the unidentified enemy is clearly honed from the opening scene.  Along with that is the ambiguous nature of Clayton, himself.  That said, Wilkinson stole this film.  He was brilliant.  His character was sympathetic despite his despicable deeds.  The honesty driving this character's articulation of his shadows not only serves to reveal Clayton's, but the act of doing so engages the guilty ego of his audience.  Very strong psychology at work in this film, and it conveys remarkably well.</p></body></html>

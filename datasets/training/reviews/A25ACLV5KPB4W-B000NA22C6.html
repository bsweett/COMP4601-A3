<meta name="summary" content="Worth a watching"></head><body><p>This movie, based on a short (or, actually, a long) story by Stephen King, is about a divorced writer who is suddenly confronted in his Maine summer home by an intense man named John Shooter, who accuses him of having plagiarized a story called Secret Window, Secret Garden. Shooter quickly becomes violent and ominous, and Rainey (Depp) tries to obtain a copy of a magazine in which the story was originally published, which predates Shooter's story by two years. As he tries to get the magazine that will prove his case, his dog is stabbed, his home is burned down, and a private detective he hires is murdered.<br /><br />  The one substantive departure from the book involved the supposition that other people could see a ghostlike version of John Shooter, and I don't think the movie suffered for the omission. It must have seemed like an unnecessary extra, given the strong twin plot lines of ongoing divorce and crazed stalker. I liked the balance between the scary stuff and the sadness of the divorce, and there were several very effective scary scenes, in which an unseen killer seems to be lurking just outside the edge of the audience's field of vision. Depp does his usual good job, this time giving us a character who is alternately emotionless and emotional, who want more than anything to wallow in depression by sleeping on the couch. Conversely, I thought that John Turturro stunk it up as John Shooter, a fact partially due to some extremely clunky dialogue that lent artifice to the southern accent. Maria Bello continues to inspire mixed feelings in me; I liked her quite a bit in "The Cooler," but thought she was the weak link in Payback, one of my favorite all-time movies. I liked her in this, I think, and also liked Timothy Hutton as her new boyfriend.<br /><br />  I downgraded it a bit because of the dialogue, mostly, which intruded on many an otherwise fine scene.</p></body></html>

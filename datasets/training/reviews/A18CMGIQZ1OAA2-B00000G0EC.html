<meta name="summary" content="steven at his best"></head><body><p>oh man hes awesome.  the color purple, jaws, jurassic park, et.  never other than a film maker basically guarantee the "wow" effect every time.  this movie never lost its magic with me or anyone ive known.<br />the gist of the movie, dont screw with mother nature.  its a scarey thought really.  ive read how there are scientist trying to re clone the wooly mammoth.  whats next, the sabertooth tiger? god forbid dinosaurs.<br />well, this movie shows what could happen.<br />a couple of fossil hounds are called in to look at a new project that a fellow scientist is working on.  a park set to open to the public full of all the pre extinct dinosaurs, including the T Rex, though i think the velocoraptor was the scaries one to me.  He invites them for a tour along with some other scientist and his two grandchildren.  during a bad storm they wind up without power and the electric fences are turned off.  Feeding time!  The dinos have no rules and these people are running around like white mice.  People are getting eaten, animals are getting eaten, theres alot of chasing, its terrifying, but at the same time the movie has some of the most beautiful scenes ever.  Its all shot on a beautiful island, there is one particular scene where they are overlooking a family of brontosaurus.  the music adds so much and there are one or two peaceful dinosaurs in the movie but dont get me wrong, the rest are meat eaters and there's a whole lot of chasing and sneaking up on humans going on.<br />i think the first one was definately the best.  the other ones that followed were great too but they didnt have the beauty of the first one, they were mainly just violent.  after the first one you really wanta scream, "are these people that stupid?!!!".  I mean people get ripped in half, 2 children are almost killed, you look around and see a big bloody mess of an island, millions of dollars are in the toilet and you think "hm, maybe we should try this again?!" some numbskull decides to transport a t rex for a viewing in the middle of the city, the scientist who started it all decides to have another go at it.  it gets to the point where you want to hit the old guy in the head with a stick and say "look at your grandkids, old man, arent they probly warped enough from the first time?"<br />lol anyways.  the first one was the best but in one of the sequels, i think it was the second one but im not certain, they see the kids again and i love the look the kids give them.  its definatly got the whole "grandads gone nuts, do something, people are gonna die again" thing going on.<br /><br />jurassic park does for the jungle and science what jaws did for trips to the beach.</p></body></html>

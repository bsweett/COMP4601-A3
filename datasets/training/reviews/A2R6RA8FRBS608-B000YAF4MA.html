<meta name="summary" content="how DO you understand the measure of a life ???"></head><body><p>The Bucket List tells the sensitive and well thought-out story of two older men who are diagnosed with cancer so severe that they have six months to live--or maybe a year if they're lucky. Look for stunning performances from both Morgan Freeman as Carter Chambers and Jack Nicholson as Edward Cole. Beverly Todd also acts her heart out as Beverly Chambers, Carter's wife.<br /><br />The action begins when Carter Chambers, a working class black man, and Edward Cole, super-wealthy self-made rich white guy who actually owns the hospital they're in become roommates in the oncology ward of the hospital. At first Carter and Edward don't exactly hit it off but it isn't long before they forge a friendship. When they each learn that by coincidence they have six months to a year to live, they embark on a trip to accomplish certain lifelong dreams and personal goals before they die. The list of things to do is called The Bucket List because it's a list of things to do before they "kick the bucket."<br /><br />Of course, because Edward Cole is wealthy many scenes in this movie become almost miraculously possible. They travel the world by private corporate jet; and they live more in just a few weeks than most people ever do in a lifetime.<br /><br />Of course, life has its ways of surprising just about any of us; so still the plot could go just about anywhere. How will Beverly, Carter's wife, react to all this? Will she understand and remain patient while Carter lives out a few lifelong dreams or will she want her husband home NOW? Will Carter and Edward be able to keep their cool when they are stranded in Asia during a monstrous snowstorm and they are not allowed to fly? What happens if one of them gets very sick along the way? What about Edward's refusal to make up with his daughter who disowned him long ago--will he ever decide to approach her or will he remain obstinate in his refusal to even meet with her? The results may surprise you. No plot spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!<br /><br />As a cancer survivor who is finishing my own chemotherapy soon, I will add that some of the side-effects of the chemotherapy they receive are exaggerated. However, I think director Rob Reiner added these elements to the film to make it somewhat more dramatic.<br /><br />Overall, The Bucket List is an excellent movie; and I couldn't have enjoyed it more. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman turn in superlative performances that proves these guys can still act better than the vast majority of actors ever could. Beverly Todd does a great job as Carter's wife; and Sean Hayes also does well as Edward Cole's personal assistant Thomas. I highly recommend this film for fans of these terrific actors; and people comfortable with the subject matter will appreciate this motion picture as well.</p></body></html>

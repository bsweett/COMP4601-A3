<meta name="summary" content="Harrowing Kubrickian Look at War!"></head><body><p>As with all of Kubrick films this is meticulously crafted to create an effect an to show us the dehumanization of men at war. The film is divided into two equally compelling halves. The first being Marine basic training,  R. Lee Ermey is scarier than any Vietnamese could hope to be as the drill  sergeant who turns his men into 'killing machines'. The second half  (vietnam combat) is also equally intense and memorable. Vincent D'Onofrio  is also devastating as a clumsy confused private. Matthew Modine adds a  little comic relief to a very heavy film but also creates a fascinating  character. But this is Kubrick's achievement, his use of sets,  cinematography and sound create a profoundly intense impact. A hell of a  war picture. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!</p></body></html>

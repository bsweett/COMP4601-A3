<meta name="summary" content="Perfectly satisfied"></head><body><p>The Watchmen graphic novel (i.e. comic book) by Alan Moore is a masterpiece.  This film is the next best thing.  Although it doesn't capture all of the graphic novel in its entirety - how could it? - it does a great job with those bits that it does.  The ending has been changed somewhat, but I thought this had been done in a way that was actually a bit better than the graphic novel in parts (the disaster at the end of the graphic novel does come off as a bit absurd), although Dr Manhattan's decision at the end is ultimately not satisfying (and a bit similar to the Batman's decision at the end of The Dark Knight, come to think of it...).  The characters are all very well cast, with the exception perhaps of Dr Manhattan, who is just a bit too CG-ized for my liking.  Oh well, why be a scrooge when the framing was so masterful, and Rorsach so superbly crafted.</p></body></html>

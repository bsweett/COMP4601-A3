There is no question that this girl is a great actress. While this film may not show you her true talents, she does do the best of what she had been given. She is definitley her hottest in this film. She might be a tad quirky in real life, but, that's endearing. This movie is pretty mediocre. I'm not a Lara Croft fan. In fact, I don't really know anything about it. I really wasn't expecting much. I didn't get much either. The silly plot about time or something, I really can't remember, was pretty transparent. I mean, I just said I can't even remember it!. The action scenes are pretty adequate. The raid on the mansion is especially fun and thrilling. It's too bad the rest of the film couldn't hold on to that thrillness. Is thrillness even a word?. Oh well. Jon Voight is on hand in a cameo as Lara's father. Voight, a brilliant actor, is pretty much not there in his performance of a barely there character. If mindless, senseless action films is your thing, you'll probaby like this. Others will probably just fall asleep. Five stars for Jolie tho. Not worth raiding.</p></body></html>

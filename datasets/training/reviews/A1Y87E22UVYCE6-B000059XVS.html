<meta name="summary" content="A Soul Divided: Lawrence's story."></head><body><p>This film is a well deserved 7 Oscar winner. A huge production effort, 10 M dollars in 1962 was a record. To fully appreciate this opus, you should see it in a theater, no doubt, but if that is not possible don't miss it. VHS or DVD will allow you to taste many of the great features of this movie.<br /><br />First: a collection of actors performing in an unusual high level: Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, Omar Shariff as Sheriff Ali, Jack Hawkins as General Allenby, Anthony Quinn as Auda abu Tayi, Alec Guinness as King Feisal.<br />Not only those performances are outstanding, lots of secondary characters are also paramount: the two kids that followed Lawrence, Michael Ray as Farraj and John Dimech as Daud; the uncredited Turk soldier that holds Lawrence while he is whipped, gives an unforgettable expression, in a scene that takes no more than three minutes; the first Bedouin guide to Lawrence (Zia Mohyeddin); the British officers showing their elitist attitudes; almost all performances are remarkable one way or the other.<br /><br />Second: the music score of Maurice Jarre with some remarkable compositions that remain as a trade mark of the movie.<br />The more than beautiful photography from Freddie Young (with an extended career that include more than 130 films), desert pictures are overwhelming, both winning Oscar.<br /><br />Third: the film director, David Lean (also Oscar winner), directs with the same allure mass battle scenes and intimate dialogues between Ali and Lawrence, Feisal and Lawrence among others. No doubt he influenced the generalized high quality of actor's performance.<br /><br />Fourth: the story a forceful recreation of a critical war period with its political implications (still unresolved after almost 90 years). The intimate description of Lawrence divided loyalties: to Arab Cause and to British Empire. Of Lawrence's spiritual suffering: he was an intellectual and a mystic thrown in the middle of a bloody war conflict and having to lead human beings to death, suffering and destruction. Lawrence's internals contradictions: he enjoyed killing a man; afterwards, he was incapable to refrain his vengeance desires. His failure to fulfill his promises. All this kaleidoscopic emotions are shown by Peter O'Toole with a compromise rarely seen; he gives real flesh and blood to his historical character.<br /><br />There are some minor historical inaccuracies (poetic licenses may we say?), King Feisal is shown as an elder man; in reality he was only a couple of years older than young Lawrence. Peter O'Toole was (approximately) 6 feet high (or 1.80 meters) and Lawrence was (approximately) 5 feet 3 inches high (or 1.65 meters), this is in a way minimized by how O'Toole managed his corporal demeanor.<br />An unforgettable film!!!<br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

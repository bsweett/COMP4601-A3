I really dont see what the big hoopla is about this movie. Yes it did have some good parts in it, but damn it seemed like there was so much senseless c**p in it also. I was expecting to watch some fantasy movie, but instead I get some crap about a girl who imagines way to much. The setting with the military guys against some geurilla warfare dudes set back in some old time was annoying. I could care less about it. Everything since the beginning of the movie was just emotionally sad. I thought their would be an uplifting in the movie, something to hold on to, something to make you have hope, but there really wasnt any of that.<br /><br />Artistically, the movie was very pretty in the special effects category. The 'faun' the little girl talks to was VERY well done and looked like a cross between CG and cosmetics (I'm not watching the specials, so I dont know for sure). The monster with eyeballs on its hands, was wickedly freaky.<br /><br />The acting wasnt to bad, but most of it was just annoying. The only good actors was the Captain (who sometimes was a little to annoying with his evilness) and the little girl.<br /><br />Seriously though...did I miss something in this movie? Why is it getting so much praise when it was mediocre at best? 'The Little Princess' is a much better movie when it comes to a girl who is in a rut pretending about fairy tales to make her life better. 'Bridge to Taribithia' was also a better movie about a kid(s) having a make believe area to better their lives... and I didnt even care for that movie that much.<br /><br />Sorry, but this just did not do it for me.</p></body></html>

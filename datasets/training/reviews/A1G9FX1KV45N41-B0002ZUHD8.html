<meta name="summary" content="A different take on King Arthur"></head><body><p>A very different portrayal of King Arthur, it aims to be the `true' historical portrayal. With all said and done it simply a different perspective, but fans of the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table should be open to a different take on the story.<br /><br />There was some things I liked about this and some things that I did not. The original story of King Arthur was indeed set before the Saxon invaders from Germany and Denmark succeeded in conquering Great Britain, and the Celtic peoples inhabited the island. As such the knights in shining armor often portrayed in Arthuric legend came considerably later in history. So I liked the idea of the costumes and weapons being closer to the age under portrayal.<br />I am not sure that I liked the idea of the Knights being `Samartians', men imported by the Romans as mercenaries from somewhere around the Ukraine.  I don't believe there is any evidence for King Arthur and his men as being anything other than indigenous to Britain. I did however like the idea of Guinevere being a Pictish Princess - played by the dark and gorgeous Kiera Knightley. Though I thought it was silly not to have Merlin at Arthur's side as his trusted friend and advisor, and to rather have him as a sort of enemy of Arthur's.<br /><br />The setting where brilliantly done, it came together well, and the caste was good. I think that Clive Owen added some force to the role of Arthur, and Iiked the casting of his knights especially Ray Winston as the rough and ready Bors.<br />The movie is entertaining and thrilling and comes together well, even if I did not like all of the way the story was written.<br /><br />It was better than First Knight , in my opinion, but not as good as Excalibur or Merlin.</p></body></html>

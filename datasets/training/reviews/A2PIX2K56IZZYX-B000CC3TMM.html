<meta name="summary" content="I tried people, I sooooo tried.........."></head><body><p>Almost every review I read of this movie said the same thing, forget about the plot holes, bad acting, over-the-top action, and just have fun with it. Well, I really tried to do that, because sometimes it does work with some movies. (Dukes Of Hazzard comes to mind) But try as I might, the negatives just kept piling up, so no amount of cool fight scenes, witty banter, or endless car chases could flip this to a 3 star movie, sorry. Jason Statham is the only decent actor in this, and I will give the movie this, Jason is just so damn cool, he isn't the worlds greatest actor, and I think he knows this, so he keeps it low-key. Do you remember Steven Seagal's first few movies he made? (way before the recent truckload of crap he's made) Jason reminds me a bit of that, but one thing, Jason is the fastest I've seen.....That fight scene in the beginning where some thugs try to carjack his Audi is fantastic.<br /><br />Anyway, this time around, Frank Martin (Statham) gets mixed up in a kidnapping plot which is just actually a cover for our main bad guy to release a deadly toxin on the world. Speaking of our main bad guy, he really sucks, I think he is French, but his accent is  so muddled it's hard to tell. He is played by Alessandro Gianni, but he is not alone in the weak acting department, Kate Nauta plays his girlfriend, and whoever her acting coach is should thing about putting in some overtime, cuz' this chick needs some work!! Plus she has something aganst clothes, she runs around the whole movie in bra and painties, don't get me wrong, she's pretty hot, but come on, it can't be that warm all the time.....<br /><br />Amber Valetta and Mathew Modine play the parents of the boy who gets kidnapped by Gianni, Although Modine looks really old, they both are fine, Valetta plays the woman attracted to the hero but still in love with her hubby role well. The kidnapped boy (Hunter Clary) has some decent moments with Statham while he is driving him home from school, but that's pretty much it.<br /><br />Everyone I've read about or talked to say the real star here is the action, and that may be true. I will not argue the fact that there are some really cool scenes, and the fight scenes are all above average except for the final fight between Martin and Gianni, kinda boring and anti-climatic. But along with being cool they are so far-fetched and unbelievable, that you find yourself say huh? intead of ooing and awing. The car chases are way too long, and also ridiculous, he jumps from the top floor of one building to the top floor of another building and his little Audi doesn't get a dent let alone a scratch, I don't think so.<br /><br />The last half hour is just plain bad, like I said earlier, Statham's fight scene with Gianni is awful as they are fighting each other in a plane with no pilot. The CG during this is really bad and choppy filming doesn't help either. Statham's fight scene with Kate Nauta is the only short fight scene and that's a shame,  I think that could have been special. But she dies like 5 minutes after they start.<br /><br />I did enjoy the first one a bit more, better plot, better car chases, the fight scenes in this one are a bit more complex and thought out, and it shows. I gave the first one 3 stars, but this one was just plain silly and poorly acted, I'd say watch the first one again, and if you still need more Statham, rent the Italian Job again.<br /><br />acting.....2.5 stars, Statham and Valetta are ok, Gassman and Nauta are sad.<br /><br />directing.....2.5 stars, Might have been better with the director of the first one<br /><br />special effects....3 stars, Poor CG, but cool fighting and car effects<br /><br />action rating....3 stars, 2 awesome fight scenes, 1 decent car chase<br /><br />quality.....2 stars, Way too choppy, constant bad angles, A surprisingly high amount of grain, and poor dialogue.</p></body></html>

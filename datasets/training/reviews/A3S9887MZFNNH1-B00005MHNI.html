<meta name="summary" content="Viddy good!"></head><body><p>I bought this on pirate video last year and was suprised at how good it was. They plan to re-release it here in Britain in the spring of 2000 I know this because I saw the colourful trailer. The story was well written  and the notorious rape scene is not as bad as they say it is. A CLOCKWORK  ORANGE delivers over 2 hours of dark humour, horror, adventure and  beethoven. Also a good soundtrack.<p>A sequel would not be as good, but it  would be interesting. This is one of Britains finest films.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better than expected"></head><body><p>I've got to admit that I didn't expect much from Superman Returns regardless of the talent involved.  Being a fan of his work on the first two X-Men films, Bryan Singer is an excellent choice to helm the silver screen return of the classic super hero, but sadly, the film never reaches the lofty heights that it sets out to attain.  Newcomer Brandon Routh is a great choice as the Man of Steel, who returns to Earth after a five year absence to find that Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) has moved on, as has the rest of the world.  The one person who hasn't truly moved on however, is Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) who has his own diabolical plans, including one that Superman might not be able to stop.  Routh is good, Spacey is a hoot, Bosworth is a bit miscast, and the rest of the cast, including James Marsden, Frank Langella, Parker Posey, Kal Penn, and Sam Huntington, are quite good.  The story, crafted by Singer and his X2: X-Men United cohorts Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, is a bit predictable but offers some nice surprises while paying homage to Richard Donner's 1978 original film, and unlike many comic book films, has actual heart to it.  The special effects are spectacular, and as a whole the film is better than I had anticipated.  It doesn't achieve what the original Superman, X2, Spider-Man 2, or Batman Begins does, but it's pretty close nevertheless.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Up (Single-Disc Edition)"></head><body><p>Up (Single-Disc Edition) is a Disney animated movie from 2009 and is about an elderly man named Carl Fredricksen who one day decides to have an adventure with unforeseen consequences. The animation is great and the storyline is well-developed. The music is amazing and won a well deserved Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Not Disneys best, however a movie that should entertain the entire family. Recommended. 4/5.</p></body></html>

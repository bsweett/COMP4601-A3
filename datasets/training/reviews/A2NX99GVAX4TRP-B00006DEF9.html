<meta name="summary" content="ON DVD.. What a Glorious Feeling, I'm Happy Again !!!"></head><body><p>One of the greatest movie musicals of all time, is also an affectionate spoof of show business and a very enjoyable old fashioned romantic comedy. It's got a greatest hits of Freed/Brown songs throughout (with the almost plageristic Make<br />'Em Laugh turned into a classic with Donald O'Connor's tour de force performance). Kelly's great but O'Connor and Hagen are even better and then there's Cyd Charisse. c. The color, choreography, performances, pacing, were all as good as some real masters of musical film (Donen/Kelly/MGM) could do in 1952. <p>The DVD is probably as good as it possibly could be for 2002 in terms of restoration, image and sound presentation.<p>The extras are more than generous with newly recorded commentaries from several surviving contributors to the film, a 35 minute love-fest of a new documentary letting you see how those still with us look today.<p>There is also the 90 minute PBS doc from a few years back that is a keeper featuring some archive footage, out-takes and more.<p>And yes there's more !!!<p>A classic treat. What are you waiting for?<p>----Christopher J. Jarmick is the author of the mystery suspense thriller, The Glass Cocoon (with Serena F. Holder).</p></body></html>

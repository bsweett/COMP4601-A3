<meta name="summary" content="was this review helpful? That isn't why people give stars here."></head><body><p>Too often I get burnt in forums like these for expressing my opinions when they are starkly against what the majority think. It isn't a question of helpful, but "did he(reviewer) agree like me on how I think it should be rated? Well, here I go again. I've got a good idea where my responses will be like from the quick look at reviewers here. But I don't care, my lifespan as a reviewer here has never been reliant on how people respond. I make my statement true to how I feel.<br />This movie stunk. I loved certain elements, but like all the great one's say, a movie is great not from segmented pieces but by the whole. It has all the makings of an indie film, which is my kind of movie. I've lived in Art houses every since 2005 with a history of violence. I love the tame and mature approach to revealing a movie. I get the sense that the aim of this movie was to produce such dramatic, theatric sadness that we couldn't handle seeing the reality of the ending. That this is no country indeed for old men, or for the matter, any men or women. Now what I'm about to say does not apply to every genre, but please: Movies are different from books not just on the intellectual approach, but also in that the power of certain cinema features it is indeed what you see that bares its most powerful infliction. Seeing is believing and to think that such an ending, almost Saprano's like, could settle such a furiously showcased film is implausible for me. It felt abandoning. A few exhasperated speeches by a Sheriff beyond his capabilities in dealing with reality and a criminal psychopath preoccupied with unknown thoughts. That's what there is, and no matter what your preception clearly that is the point, it is up to great discussion. But for me, that discussion is short lived because I save my great discussions for politics and greater films.</p></body></html>

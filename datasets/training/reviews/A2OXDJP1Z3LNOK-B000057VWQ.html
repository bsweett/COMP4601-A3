<meta name="summary" content="Pure and simple:  It's a wonderful movie!"></head><body><p>I started my yearly ritual of wathcing this movie back in my teen years.  While technically not a Christmas movie is has become adopted as one.  The real point is that life is worth living and that everyone truly matters.  George Biley had to find out the hard way - what becomes of life when only one person is not there to affect outcomes.<p>This movie is wonderfully acted and the overall message is a beautiful one.  I still make it part of my Christmas tradition.  <p>Interesting note:  the kid that is talking to Mary in the gym dance - she's distracted from his story when she sees George:  that kid played Alfalfa in the Little Rascals!</p></body></html>

Will Smith stars as military scientist Robert Neville, who very well may be the last man on Earth.  Along with his dog Sam, Neville searches for a way to save humanity, which has been reduced to a vampiric race after a cancer vaccine went awry three years earlier.  Where I Am Legend works is first and foremost with Smith, who is so good as the isolated, lonely, and desperate Neville that he alone will keep you glued to the screen.  Smith's performance ranks as one of his best, as sometimes we forget just how good an actor the man is, he reminds us again here.  The visions of a desolate, unpopulated New York City is also one of the film's strengths, offering some very impressive visuals.  Where I Am Legend fails however is with the directing of Constantine director Frances Lawrence, whose action scenes are made worse thanks to some surprisingly lacking digital effects work.  I Am Legend could really have been something special here, regardless of how much it departs from Matheson's book, but alas, it just isn't.  Still though, I Am Legend isn't bad one bit, and the alternate theatrical cut included in this two-disc set is even better than the regular cut.  All in all, I Am Legend is definitely worth a look whether you are a fan of Will Smith's or a fan of Matheson's work, but be prepared to start thinking of what could have been after the credits start rolling.</p></body></html>

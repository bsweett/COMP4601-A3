Young FBI trainee Clarice Starling(played by Jodi Foster) goes to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (played by Anthony Hopkins) to learn more about the serial killer Buffalo Bull.  I think we all know the story, we have all seen the movie, but never has a movie had such an effect upon my mind.<br />There were scenes of gore, but the psychlogical effect of this movie runs deep, perhaps it is because we know that there are people out there like Dr. Lecter who prey upon our loved ones.<br />That is a scary thought! One that is always lingering in our minds even if we do not let it surface.<br />The acting was excellent, the story line chilling and the conclusion outstanding!  A great nail bitting movie right to the end!</p></body></html>

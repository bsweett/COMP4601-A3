<meta name="summary" content="ONE OF THE BEST ZOMBIE MOVIES EVER MADE 9.5 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>28 Days Later essentially reinvented how both horror and zombie films should be made. The movie starts out with a group of environmentalists break into an animal testing facility and try to free test chimps. Unfortunately they do not listen to the pleas of the scientist they are holding hostage who says that they're infected with the rage virus, so a chimp gets out, bites one of the group members, she becomes infected almost immediately, and all hell breaks loose from then on. Then the story follows a man named Jim who wakes up in a hospital in the middle of the virus outbreak. The gore is disgusting(especially the part where Jim squishes the eyes of a soldier with his thumbs), the zombies are terrifying and they can run, and Jim hooks up with strange people to get to different locations in the hopes of safety from the infected. If you love zombie movies you will love this movie, especially for how terrifying the zombies are.</p></body></html>

Saavik, undergoes the no-win "Kobiyashi Maru" test. As expected, she fails the test, but learns (over the course of the film) the meaning of the test. She also finds out that Kirk is the only Star Fleet graduate that ever won the no-win scenario.<p>The film progresses to the planet Seti-Alpha 6 (or so they thought) where Chekov & Capt. Terrell from the starship Reliant are investigating the possibility of using the planet for the "Genesis Project". To their dismay, they find that they are on the wrong planet when they come across the survivors of the genetically-enhanced super-humans who had been marooned there by Kirk years earlier. Their leader, Khan Noonien Singh, wants revenge on Kirk.<p>Kahn and his followers capture the starship Reliant so that Kahn can find and destory Kirk. Kahn also wants all information and materials for the "Genesis Project". He attacks the space station whose commander was a former lover of Kirk--Dr. Carol Marcus. Their son, Dr. David Marcus, is also involved.<p>The U.S.S. Enterprise, under the command of Capt. Spock, is on a training mission. When the space station is attacked, it is the closest starship to the station. Admiral Kirk assumes command to find out who attacked the space station. When he arrives, he is in for a very big surprise!<p>The fighting between Kirk and Kahn is intense and results in the death of a very major "Star Trek" character.<p>This film is a must have for any "Star Trek" fan!<p>The second DVD included with the Director's Cut contains interviews with original cast members (Shatner, Nimoy, Kelley) as well as Gene Roddenberry and other people that contributed directly to the Star Trek's on-going legacy.  Again, it's a very worthwhile item that any Star Trek fan will enjoy having for years to come!</p></body></html>

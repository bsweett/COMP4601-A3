And that's not too far off plotwise.<br /><br />We all know what happened in 1974's Death Wish, right? In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000541AN">Death Wish</a> some hoodlums put the hurt on Charles Bronson's family and Bronson goes Medieval on New York City's bad guys with a roll of quarters in a sock and a gun.<br /><br />Well Death Wish didn't win any big awards, but it was certainly a cult classic that holds up to this day. On the other hand, I wouldn't be surprised to see Jodie Foster nab a nomination (from the MTV Movie Awards at minimum) for her role as Paul Kersey...er...um...I mean Erica "Pain" Bain.<br /><br />Foster really is a great actress and she makes you feel the agony that she is going through after the loss of a loved one. She also does an A-list job of taking a personality from Princess Leia to The Dark Side of the Force.<br /><br />Terrence Howard (who's in more movies in 2007 & 2008 than anyone I think) plays a cool, enjoyable to watch detective with his own mini side-story. But the key is that all of the side stories--and there really aren't that many--take a back seat to the primary script. The script that drew so many to the simple concept of Death Wish. The vigilante on the loose.<br /><br />The story is well-told and focuses on Foster's acts of retribution as much as the moral dilemma of being brutally violated, then taking severe action against the violating crowd, but questioning yourself and being questioned by the public for your response to the original attack committed against you (Hey, remind you any current events?).<br /><br />Director Neil Jordan keeps the action real enough in The Brave One so as to make you think you've got a window into something-that-is-really-happening. There are a couple of over the top sequences...especially in the last 15 or so minutes...but otherwise, the emotion, suspense and tense situations will keep you in your seat and thoroughly entertained for its full 2 hour runtime.<br /><br />The Brave One was definitely worth the trip off the couch and out to the theater. At minimum, don't miss it when it comes out on DVD.</p></body></html>

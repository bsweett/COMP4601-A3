<meta name="summary" content="EXPLOSIVE NEW BOX SET - BUT IS IT TOO MUCH?!?"></head><body><p>By now everyone knows who Ellen Ripley is - Sigourney Weaver.  Actually she's the heroine of this 4 film - 8 disc phenomenon called &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot;.  This box set includes all four films in the series in revamped, modified, remastered and re-edited editions. Why? - primarily because number three and four in the series could really use the help - I'm assuming, but hey, it's a pretty good guess.<br />PLOT of all four films: A survivor of an alien attack - Ellen Ripley, goes back for more and more punishment against a really nasty looking aggressor from outer space that by the last installment looks more like a finger puppet reject from Jim Henson's muppet lab.  Okay, enough criticism on the special effects.  Seriously, though; my advice to anyone who wants the original masterpiece from Ridley Scott and James Cameron's brilliant sequel; wait till January when the films will be made available separately.<br />TRANSFERS: Near pristine.  &quot;Alien&quot; - the first film, is the real stand out.  Color balancing is superb. Flesh tones are richly textured. Blacks are black. The haze and related age artifacts are practically non-existant. Film grain has been greatly reduced over the previous issued DVD. The audio has been masterfully updated. &quot;Aliens&quot; - same transfer as before; Cameron didn't really see the need to update it.  Near pristine. All of the above criteria apply. &quot;Alien 3&quot; Pristine transfer - sorry excuse for a sequel - even in this re-edited form. &quot;Alien Ressurection&quot; - I'm going to sleep, just thinking about it. All of the above criteria apply to these transfers as well.<br />EXTRAS: I'm not even going to bother. Suffice it to say, that if you invest in this box set you will possess the largest compendium of useless information available to mankind on a digital format.  While the documentaries are a fantastic bonus, much of the material featured there is repeated in other &quot;extras&quot;.  There's also a lot of junket material that really doesn't enhance your movie going experience so much as it indoctrinates you into believing part &quot;4&quot; is the greatest horror/sci-fi of all time. Yeah, right!<br />BOTTOM LINE: Wait for parts one and two to become available on their own.  They're the only ones worth owning.</p></body></html>

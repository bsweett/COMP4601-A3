I really wasn't all that excited because I was not exactly a fan of the comics, and I never really cared for superheroes. But this film surprised me beyond belief, I really liked it and I saw it twice at the movies, both times the level of excitement and interest were unbelievably high!<p>In the near future, where children are being born with a special X-Factor in their genes, giving them special powers, and making them &quot;mutants&quot;, the seeds of a new Holocaust are being sewn by Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Daivson). The situation brings fellow mutants and former friends Erik Lehnsherr, a.k.a. Magneto (Ian McKellen), and Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) into opposition. While Xavier seeks to stop the hatred toward mutants peacefully, Magneto seeks to even things out, with a machine that would speed up the mutation process in all humans, making everyone equal. To stop Magneto, Xavier brings together a special group of mutants called &quot;X-Men&quot; to stop him. In the meantime, 2 mysterious mutants, one named Logan (Hugh Jackman), a powerful and agressive mutant with no past, no memories, and a young girl named Rogue (Anna Paquin) emerge. Their quests for identities eventually land them in the sights of Xavier and Magneto, but for what purpose?<p>X-Men is a largely enjoyable and well-paced comic adaption that mixes thrills, action, science and comedy all into 90 minutes, and does it quite superbly. The star-filled cast all have a blast, really bringing the mutants alive, newcomer Hugh Jackman in particular, he's really quite stunning as Wolverine, and he is going to be huge. Famke Jenssen and Halle Berry should've been used more, but the plot is mostly worked around Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen + Jackman and Anna Paquin, so it really uses up most of the room. But, that's a minor flaw, in an awesomely-decorated, excellently strung-together piece of work that is much better than anyone had the right to expect.<p>Roll on X-Men 2. It can't come soon enough!</p></body></html>

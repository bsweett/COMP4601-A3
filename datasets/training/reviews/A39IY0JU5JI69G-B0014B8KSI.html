First, the theme--others have objected that the bad-corporation-vs-the-good-little-people theme has been done already, but it's a worthy idea, one deserving of repetition.  (Does anyone complain that war films have already been done?)<br /><br />The story is good. I think the weakness of the film lies in where the emphasis was to be.  Is it a "character driven" tale of a man in crisis or is it a thriller? Since it is entitled after the main character, Michael Clayton, and since Clooney as Clayton is in almost every scene, it seems to me that this is supposed to be the tale of the journey of the hero.  Clayton is supposed to be a guy on the skids, divorced, not relating all that well to his only child, in big debt for a bad restaurant venture, battling a gambling addiction, and pushed to the lower rungs of the law firm where he's worked for years.  In a crisis involving the future of his law firm and his own career, he makes some decisions that redeem him to a state of lost innocence.<br /><br />It's a great idea. I just didn't see any of this in Clooney's performance.  Perhaps he's suffering from being a hot, successful movie star, but to me he looked like he just stepped off the cover of GQ--dapper, charming, classy and ever cool.  He reminds me of a latter day Cary Grant, who, it seems to me suffered from the same syndrome, although in the 50's when Grant made his best films, glamour and sophistication were more highly prized than depth of character.<br /><br />I loved Clooney in "Oh Brother," when he played a goofy hillbilly.  I guess that was before he was moved up to the A-list of Hollywood hunks.  I'd like to see him show some vulnerability and ragged edges--it would have made this character much more believable and the story more touching.  He plays the whole film with the same expression on his face for all occasions--talking to his son, trying to get through to the manic-depressive co-worker,  begging his boss for a $70,000 loan, dealing with his drug addict brother, or having a mystic moment with three horses. He never sweats, musses his hair, or shows any of the desperation that the character is supposed to be feeling.<br /><br />This comes across almost as a James Bond film, with the slick, cool hero defeating the cause of evil, without breaking a sweat. (I confess I haven't seen any Bond films in a while---maybe they've been updated.)  There is plenty of sweat pouring out of Tilda Swinton as the arch enemy and plenty of crazed vulnerability from Tom Wilkinson as the mentally ill co-worker.  Some complain that both performances are a bit over-the-top and that may be so but at least they are emoting!  Likewise, the drug addicted brother who looks like he just stumbled out of a dumpster and the intense hit-and-run driver.  You really know where all of these folks are coming from.  Clooney just keeps on being gorgeous and cool.<br />So, at the end, while we cheer his defeat of the bad guys, we don't really get it that he has changed.  We don't see it, cinematically---that's what movies are about--to show this.  Maybe the writer/director was so thrilled to get Clooney for the film that he didn't dare impose any real direction on him.<br /><br />My other objection to the film is that it is confusing. Lots of other reviewers here made the same complaint. It took me quite a while to figure out who all these folks were and what they had to do with each other.  That's a device that works well in some films--creating a sense of tension and curiosity.  But here it goes on too long and some people just loose interest, so that by the time we understand who they are, we don't care so much.  I know that linear time is considered pasee by some film makers but when you play with time in this way, it has to be done in a better way.<br /><br />Send Clooney to Actors' Studio!</p></body></html>

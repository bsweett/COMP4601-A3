<meta name="summary" content="Review of Boxed Set only (film itself = 5 stars)"></head><body><p>Nothing to say about the film itself - simply a word of warning about the box set: it appears from the product listing to be simply a copy of the ordinary 2 DVD edition - which retails for less than half the price of this boxed set - with a copy of the screenplay and some cards and senitypes (whatever they are) thrown in.<br /><br /> The complete screenplay can be obtained from literally hundreds of places on the net - just try googling on &quot;anarcho-syndicalist commune&quot; and you'll see.<br /><br /> You do the maths. Twenty bucks for some cards?<br /><br /> Someone's having a laugh, and my guess is he's not part of a self-perpetuating autonomous collective.<br /><br /> Olly Buxton</p></body></html>

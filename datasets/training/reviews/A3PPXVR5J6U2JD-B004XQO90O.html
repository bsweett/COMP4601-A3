The premise is simple, if considerably underused in science fiction.  Source Code seeks to correct that imbalance. Like Donnie Darko, Source Code posits that perception is reality. There's no such thing as one time stream, but rather multiple streams formed every time a decision is made.<br /><br />Source Code uses this many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics to fight the war on terror. Army helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is co-opted to investigate a terrorist attack on a train in Chicago. He jumps into the body of Sean Fentress, a school teacher, who is traveling with his attractive but platonic companion Christina Warren (adorable Michelle Monaghan).  It doesn't end well.<br /><br />Air Force Captain Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) soon dispels Stevens' confusion: he has eight minutes to go back into the Source Code, a snapshot of reality that's basically a highly interactive video game.  Time is of the essence, so Stevens is sent back into the Source Code again and again to find the bomb and the identity of the terrorist, his reservations notwithstanding. It's about this time that Source Code starts to strain under the weight of its plot.<br /><br />Stripped to its basics, Source Code is basically a two-person play about relationships, one in person (Stevens/Warren) and the other long-distance (Stevens/Goodwin).  The camera pulls in tight on Gyllenhall and Farmiga as they engage in alternately pained, exasperated, frustrated, and flirty conversations.  It pulls out to appreciate Monaghan's loveliness and Gyllenhall's handsome profile.  This is an actor's movie.<br /><br />It's also a Duncan Jones film, who is fast becoming a modern-day Phillip K. Dick as he tackles questions of self in his films. Like Moon, Source Code is as much about the definition of reality as it advances the plot.<br /><br />Which is perhaps why the resolution isn't particularly compelling.  Source Code studiously avoids any hint of political controversy by having a bland villain with little motivation. It telegraphs its plot twists. And its ending is a little too neat for my tastes.  But then, Source Code is more interested in poking your brain than tugging your heart strings.  Jones' primary goal seems to be focused on getting the audience to view time travel differently, and in that regard Source Code is a resounding success.  I finally grokked the basics of quantum mechanics thanks to the extras on the DVD.</p></body></html>

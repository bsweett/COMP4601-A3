<meta name="summary" content="Fun, Fun, Fun, For Everyone! Go Michael Meyer!"></head><body><p>AUSTIN POWERS IN GOLDMEMEBER is a fun and fantastic film for those who like, farce, parody and just movies that break that fourth wall and talk to the camera. Michael Meyers (I Married An Axe Murderer, Shrek) is a creative genius with this character and if all he did was make these movies - he would make the world a much better place.<p>This story takes us back in time to the 70's and even farther back to when Austin Powers, Nigel and even Dr. Evil were in High School together. Keep in mind that Mike Meyers plays Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Goldmember, Fat Bastard. He does an amazing job and you can't even tell it is him.<p>Directed by Jay Roach (Meet The Parents, Mystery, Alaska) the film tells the tale of 7's undercover agent Foxy Brown played by Beyonce Knowles (know for the pop group Destiny's Child) who helps track the whereabouts of the Evil Dr. Evil and the disgusting dead skin eating Goldmemeber.<p>Everyone is back - including Michael York (Logan's Run, Island Of Dr. Monroe) as Secret Defense Leader Nigel and Seth Green (Rock Star, Rat Race) as Dr. Evil misguided and somewhat confused son.<p>The most amazing thing is all the cameo appearances that are in the movie and how they got everyone to do a minute or two in the film. People like Steven Speilberg, Tom Cruise, Gweneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny Divito and Nathan Lane to name a few.<p>The DVD is phenomenal and besides all the extras, the best part is the revoicing studio where you actually put your own voice over the characters and play as if you were in the movie. The extra's including the commentary are extremely funny.<p>If you have the other two - this is a must have - if you have never seen it - be prepared to laugh hysterically. Get it - you'll love it!

On the big screen the disastrous (couldn't think of a better word) Waterworld (1995) and Al Gore's enthralling but frightening An Inconvenient Truth (2006) both depicted the suggested consequences of global warming. Okay, Waterworld was very loosely tapping into the scientific zeitgeist by having the ice caps melting and flooding the world, but An Inconvenient Truth laid the argument bare and put forward evidence that global warming is a very real and significant threat. Roland Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow is in a similar vein, throwing the world into turmoil and giving us an insight into where this contentious `global warming' may lead us and our descendants.<br /><br />The film begins with paleoclimatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) drilling for ice samples on the Larsen Ice Shelf in Antarctica. Suddenly, the entire shelf breaks from the rest of the continent leaving Jack to conclude that global warming is to blame and through further research he predicts calamity for the world in 100-1000 years unless steps are taken to minimise damage to the earth. Jack's prediction proves to be correct but the only problem is the timescale he has suggested, with multiple disasters occurring worldwide within days rather than centuries! While the impact of global warming is felt throughout the world it is the northern hemisphere that faces the biggest threat in the form of an approaching Ice Age! Jack has the added problem of his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is in New York and directly in the firing line of Mother Nature.<br /><br />A film of this type will always put more emphasis on the visuals than anything else and in this respect it doesn't disappoint. Personally, I do believe global warming is real and a threat to the planet so it was quite frightening to see giant hailstone hitting Japan, freezing conditions grounding helicopters and turning pilots to ice in seconds, Los Angeles devastated by multiple tornadoes, while the Statue of Liberty is firstly engulfed by the rising ocean which then pours relentlessly into the heart of New York. If tornadoes and rising water levels aren't bad enough the inhabitants of the northern hemisphere face blizzard super storms causing plunging temperatures and manifesting themselves as all-conquering snow and ice. At one stage those temperatures plummet to -150F when the eye of the storm passes over New York. Anyone outside is instantly frozen while the cold pours into buildings in the form of rivers of ice that traverse floors and walls as if they are flowing water! It's a terrifying spectacle watching Mother Nature run riot and an important reminder that mankind are not the most powerful force in the world, no matter how much we try and convince ourselves otherwise.<br /><br />Though depicting a worldwide disaster the film is in essence about father and son, Jack and Sam, who have a fragile relationship at the outset but are both instrumental in helping many during the global crisis. After Jack has spent most of his time trying to convince the US government about what is going to unfold, he sets off on a journey through the snow to rescue his son. In New York Sam is attending an academic competition with student friends, including love interest Laura (Emmy Rossum), and takes heed of his father's warnings by having survivors of the flood hit city hide out in the New York Library. Many eventually leave and take their chances in the snow but Sam persuades a small group to stay behind or face death in the plunging temperatures outside. Aside from a brief foray outdoors for medical supplies, Sam's biggest test is keeping everyone alive and warm in the library, emptying vending machines and burning pointless books - a collection to do with taxes for instance, which I had to salute. While Jack and Sam continue their individual struggles for survival the rest of those in the northern hemisphere are forced to turn south in search of sanctuary. I was amused by the Americans forcing their way into Mexico by smashing the fences along the border whereas previously the Mexicans had faced stringent rules if they ever wished to head north. There's a spot of irony in there somewhere.<br /><br />Acting-wise I wasn't astonished by any of the cast but that's not saying anyone was awful either. A film on this scale is always going to draw the audience towards the visuals rather than the characters and acting, but that is often what makes a huge box office hit and it did this film no harm. I didn't feel many of the characters had much depth to them and the central storyline of a father and son building bridges amidst a global disaster is one with an outcome that is easy to predict. That said, the film doesn't resort to a typical Hollywood ending by having some scientist flick a switch and all is well. Though a global disaster, the northern hemisphere is the area of most concern here, whereas many other parts of the world are untouched by any calamity. A future remains for much of the population but for many it is a fierce struggle for survival from which millions perish.<br /><br />The Day After Tomorrow is a decent depiction of the kind of disasters that Mother Nature can deliver with mankind's defences powerless in offering any opposition. While the characters were not particularly engaging I still found myself interested in the eventual outcome and was pleased I didn't get a clich&eacute; Hollywood ending where all is well again and that global disaster was a minor inconvenience. The disaster in this film is a devastating one and still leaves mankind in a precarious position as they face an unknown future.</p></body></html>

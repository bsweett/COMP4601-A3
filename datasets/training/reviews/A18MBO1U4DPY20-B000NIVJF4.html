<meta name="summary" content="Enthralling"></head><body><p>This is without doubt one of best films of 2006 and I think that is saying a lot considering what a brilliant year it was for movies. The acting in this film is definitely very good, I liked the amount of tension it builds and how it kept me engaged and concerned. Weak points, if any, could be the central character's defiance is shown with a touch too much uplomb, I felt. Not exactly riveting but definitely enthralling. Leaves a mark, one of the films you discuss with the best friend of yours especially the aspirin plus beer scene.<br />I also find Last King of Scotland is particularly overlooked by audiences and movie lovers worldwide because it isn't exactly too pomp on the mainstream meter. Over look that and you have one fine exhibit of human spirit or lack of it. If you liked this film, I would recommend "Seven Years in Tibet"</p></body></html>

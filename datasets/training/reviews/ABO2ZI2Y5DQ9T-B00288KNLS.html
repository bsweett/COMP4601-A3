<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) Fantasy with Dark Edges"></head><body><p>After very disappointing "Monkeybone," Henry Selick, director of "The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)" and "James and the Giant Peach (1996)", has returned with "Coraline," a delightful stop-motion animated fantasy tale - a bit dark one as based on a Neil Gaiman book. This is a modern-day adventure of Alice-like spirited heroine encountering these eccentric characters in another universe, some of which could be as terrifying as the head-chopping Queen of Hearts.<br /><br />Coraline Jones (voice by Dakota Fanning) has recently moved in the 150-year-old Pink Palace Apartments. The 11-year-old girl has no friends to talk to, except a slightly nervous boy "Wybie" (Robert Bailey, Jr.). And Coraline's parents Charlie (voice by John Hodgman) and Mel (voice by Teri Hatcher) are too busy.<br /><br />But Coraline, an independent, intelligent and curious girl, finds a strange door while exploring the old house. She then discovers a big secret about it. Through the door, only at night, she can go to the "other" world, where she meets the "Other Mother" and the "Other Father." The other parents are caring and loving - and the Other Father, always delightful, is an incredibly gifted pianist!<br /><br />It is only natural that Coraline starts visiting the other world frequently. But there is another big secret about the wonderful world and its inhabitants Coraline has not known yet.<br /><br />The storyline itself may not b exactly original and Coraline's adventure (or "game") is not really an adventure to some, but like many classic fairy tales "Coraline" is most intriguing and disturbing when it suggests the fate of those who have made a wrong decision. With colorful and imaginative (and sometimes even creepy) visuals, strong voice acting from Dakota Fanning giving life to the heroine, "Coraline" is an engaging fantasy with some dark edges.</p></body></html>

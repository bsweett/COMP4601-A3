With the help of supernatural powers, Blaze morphs into Ghost Rider, the Devil's own bounty hunter. Strangely, he can use the devilish powers for good ends, something that eventually enables him to turn on Mephistopheles himself.<br /><br />The movie is quite weak, as movies based on comics tend to be. The plot is illogical at times. "Ghost Rider" is saved to some extent by the dramatic finale, where Johnny Blaze confronts Blackheart, a fallen angel who has come to create Hell on Earth.<br /><br />Most of "Ghost Rider" only deserves two stars, but because of the ending, I give it three.<br /><br />A weird fact: when I watched this film on Swedish TV, all cable channels suddenly went off line in my neighbourhood, immediately before the rider's last stand with Blackheart! Creepy. Is Mephisto watching us, or...?</p></body></html>

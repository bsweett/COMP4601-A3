<meta name="summary" content="Excellent"></head><body><p>All I can say is the first 45 minutes or so I was skeptical about this movie, but from the 45 min mark on the movie got quit intense. I dont want to say to much, but, it is a movie you will hate or love there is no in between. Like I said for the first 45 minutes i was  not sure but the last 45 minutes was just so AWESOME its hard to not tell anyone not to check this movie out.<br /><br />the ending is completley unexpected as it had me  just in complete shock, and up to an an hour and half later still thinking about it.  It is so realistic and it can happen to anyone  in any situation it just make you think wow im lucky not be like that and it hits you right in the heart, wher I actually felt sorry for the mother, Harry ,marloin wayans [whatever his name was , and the girlfriend. The most shocking is what comes of the girlfriedn and the mother. for $10 the movie is well worth quit a intense ending it might offend some , but let me say one thing it was as realitic as it gets. Just an amazing ending and very emotional. Great job.</p></body></html>

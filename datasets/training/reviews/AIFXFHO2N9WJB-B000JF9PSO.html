<meta name="summary" content="They Sat Down As Strangers, But Stood Up As One..."></head><body><p>On September 11th, 2001, our nation was changed forever. Terrorists from overseas came to our land and dealt us with a devastating blow, attacking the twin towers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. As the terrorists thought we were down for the count, we did what we've done so many times before, we came back stronger and paid them back in full, and are continuing to do so through the war on terror. In 2006, two films were released that chronicled certain events from that day, one was Oliver Stone's ("Any Given Sunday" and "Alexander") heartfelt tribute to the rescue efforts at Ground Zero in "World Trade Center", and the other was the documentary-style "United 93" from director Paul Greengrass ("The Bourne Supremacy" and "The Bourne Ultimatum"). The latter of which is the film that I will be discussing here.<br /><br />"United 93" tells the powerful story of the passengers aboard the last hijacked flight who thwarted the terrorists from delivering another deadly blow to our country. As 3 hijacked planes had hit their intended targets, the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the fourth plane landed in a field, unsuccessfully finding its target. On that tragic morning it seemed as if nothing could stop the terrorist plot, but as the passengers aboard flight 93, via cell phone conversations with loved ones, were quickly learning of what had been transpiring on the ground, they knew they had to do something. Because the only way their flight wasn't going to be turned into another deadly weapon was for them to rise up as one, and fight back!<br /><br />Many people felt that even after 5 years, it was still too soon to chronicle the events of that tragic day on film. Some even thought that the events should never be put to film, because for some the wound would never heal. For those people I have nothing but sympathy for them, and I completely understand why they would not want to see this film, or "World Trade Center". However, for the rest of us, I believe that this film and it's counterpart serve as chilling reminders of that day, of what evil actually lurks around in our world, but also of the incredible courage and indomitable will of the American spirit.<br /><br />With "United 93", acclaimed director Paul Greengrass, serving as both writer and director for the film, has crafted a very moving, incredibly realistic account of what may have transpired aboard that flight. Many of the scenes were based on cell phone conversations between the passengers and their relatives, what was heard on the cockpit recordings, and the rest was based on family members descriptions of what their loved ones were like throughout their lives. Compiling all of these elements together, Greengrass has made "United 93" into a film that honors those brave souls that sat down as strangers and stood up as one.<br /><br />Assisting Greengrass in honoring those victims of 9/11, was a cast of extremely talented, yet unknown actors and actresses that were given the unenviable task of playing these people in this highly emotional time, and not disrespecting their memory or their surviving families. Even though the actors/actresses were not a who's-who of Hollywood, they all handled each of their parts just as good as any A-lister, delivering such heartfelt emotion and depth in every performance. A truly magnificent job on all of their parts, I honestly believe that they did an exemplary job of honoring the memory of the people they were portraying.<br /><br />I know that many of the families of the victims of that day may never see this movie, but should they ever see it, I believe that they will be honored by the performances of the actors, and the very realistic and moving film that Paul Greengrass has assembled. For those of you out there that feel you don't need to see this movie to remember that day, I understand you viewpoint, but I truly believe you should one day choose to watch this film so that you can remember that even in our darkest hour, there are those who will choose to be heroes.<br /><br />"United 93" is rated R for violence and language.</p></body></html>

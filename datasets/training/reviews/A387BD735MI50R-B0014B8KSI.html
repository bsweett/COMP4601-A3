<meta name="summary" content="The Fixer Needs Some Fixing"></head><body><p>George Clooney plays a law firm "fixer" here. I early began to suspect that that post might be as much of a cinematic invention as "The Cooler," a person casinos presumably hire to jinx people off winning streaks. In his DVD commentary, the Director of "Michael Clayton" says he asked law firms if indeed there was such a job description as "fixer," someone who solves problems for them outside the confines of strict legal protocol. Most of them said there were "fixers," but that they didn't have any such person currently working for them. They would steer him to some other law firm that they believed used a fixer's services. That firm would in turn relay him farther on down the street to still yet another firm. And so on, always seemingly keeping him one step away. Or else the various firms said they might have employed a fixer in the past, but didn't anymore. So this job title becomes almost urban legend - something that happened to someone else, at some other time.<br /><br />I would have been content to accept this fiction for the purposes of an interesting movie. What I did find disappointing though was that Clooney never actually seemed to fix anything. At least in the early montage of problems we see being presented to him to establish his role, he does nothing helpful or clever. For example, he's called to the home of one of the firm's long-time clients to help this client sidestep a possible hit-and-run charge. When Coonley arrives, all he does is tell the client he'll refer him to a criminal attorney. The client (and perhaps the movie viewer) is rightfully indignant at this lack of legerdemain. Then in the DVD bonus material, we see another scene that was cut from the final film, in which Clooney tells his former mate that he made a problem disappear. When she asks "How?" - all he does is wink.<br /><br />This is frustrating to the viewer, and seems to stem from a certain amount of lazy script-writing. In the related genre of heist films, such as Clooney's "Ocean's 11," we expect to see at least one clever filching technique demonstrated along the way.<br /><br />In general, it was hard for me to see how this film went so far towards getting an Academy Award. Other problems with the writing include the use of coincidence, and the use of clich&eacute; (once again the Big Corporation looms as a fictional Silkwood foe, a diabolical, ubiquitous evil).<br /><br />However Tom Wilkinson's performance as the loony, but still brilliant lawyer - is truly memorable and rescues this whole movie from its sort of improbable, forgettable plot.</p></body></html>

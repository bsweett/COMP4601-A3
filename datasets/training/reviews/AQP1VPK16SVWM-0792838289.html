<meta name="summary" content="Satire and political thriller all rolled into one"></head><body><p>&quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; was a product of its era that has managed to transcend the era that produced it. This political satire and thriller captures the sense of paranoia that existed in America during the 50's and early 60's. Frank Sinatra, Lawrence Harvey, Angela Lansbury and James Gregory all give top notch performances in John Frankenheimer's classic film of Richard Condon's novel.<p>A platoon of soliders are betrayed by their military guide and captured by the North Koreans during the Korean War. Their subjected to mind control techniques to make one of them the perfect assassin. When they return home, the platoon's captain (Sinatra)begins having nightmares where his Sgt. Shaw (Harvey)kills two of his men in cold blood. In these dreams they are surrounded by the enemy in a lecture hall being conditioned for the mind control experiments. It's clear that the Sgt. has been conditioned to become a &quot;sleeper&quot; agent--impossible to detect because he doesn't know that he's now an agent for a foreign power. Additionally, Shaw's mother (Lansbury)uses the concerns over communists in the US government to launch her husband's (Gregory)bit to be put on the ticket for the vice-presidency.<p>This new edition comes with two featurettes. The first features director William Freidkin (&quot;The French Connection&quot;, &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot;)in an appreciation of Frankenheimer's career. Freidkin discusses how &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; broke with the conventions of political thrillers of the time. The second features 15 minute interview with Angela Lansbury about working on the film.<p>The animated menus is also new and the features from the first disc including Frakenheimer's marvelous commentary track are kept in tact. Do you need to upgrade to this new edition? Only if you didn't purchase the previous one. The previous edition had both the widescreen and full screen versions of the film and all the features here except the two previously mentioned featurettes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An apocalyptic script!"></head><body><p>Danny Boyle made the most difficult: to recreate with astonishing realism, the end of the Western Civilization. The admirable locations and the magnificent suspense parameters confers to the viewers of a weird anguish sensation and increasing unexpectedness.<br /><br />But, the dramatic rope simply could not bear more and collapsed since the two thirds of the movie. Because of the script needed a major chilling punch. And that is why I cannot give it the five stars.</p></body></html>

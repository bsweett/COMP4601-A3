She looks brilliant as Queen Elizabeth and her acting is incredible.  She's the best, along with Nicole Kidman and Naomi Watts.  This is a film that takes you on a journey like a time machine, and you are met by Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth.  She captivates you with all of her flair and queeny nuances.  The story is bizarre but then again so were those times of wine and roses, "let them eat cake" so they say.  This is a film that showcases the old school diva.  Elizabeth was the first diva, she is OG, she is gangsta.</p></body></html>

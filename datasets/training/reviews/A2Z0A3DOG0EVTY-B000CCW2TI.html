<meta name="summary" content="The Most Riveting and Forgettable Film of the Year"></head><body><p>On the outset I'm going to give Wes Craven's new film "RED EYE" my wholehearted endorsement.  It's a well-made movie that shows off Craven's talent for gripping suspense.  There were moments that this film grabbed me.  Moments where I gripped my seat and gritted my teeth, and actually interacted with the film.  That is the Hallmark of a good thriller, even if the film itself isn't that good.<br /><br />RED EYE is the harrowing tale of a young woman named Lisa (Brooke Adams, Mean Girls) and a bright and yet whole heartedly inept "BAD GUY" named Jackson (Cillian Murphy, Batman Begins), who are brought together on a Red Eye between Texas and Miami. Unbeknownst to Lisa she's caught up in a political plot to kill the head of homeland security, and the only way to survive is to outsmart her captors.  I'd mention more, but I'd spoil the eventual outcome, or maybe not.<br /><br />The problem is that the whole film is on autopilot.  Everyone in the film is present and accounted for.  They all have a small piece in the puzzle.  RED EYE has one goal to get you to the end.  That's where the film fails.  It fails at a basic level where characters become plot points, and merely spout out dialogue to get from point A to point B.  If you can stand this, you'll be able to sit through the first half of the movie where mysteries are set up and briefly described away.  Where much fanfare is made of characters, who serve very little face time, and whose only goal is to get the story moving.  In fact there is a  little girl in the film whose whole point of being there is to kick a duffel bag.<br /><br />But wait hold on a sec......  You told me I should go see this movie and yes I agree you should. Does the film work? Sort of.  Do I think the movie succeeds in what it's doing? Yes, but  in a very shallow and one-dimensional way.  Is this film going to make and critics top 100 lists? No.  This is the kind of film you probably find in the $5.50 bin at Walmart two years from now.  It is utterly forgettable.<br /><br />But up there on the big screen, the suspense works.  The last 30 minutes of this film work perfectly.  It also includes one of the best chase scenes I've seen in a while, it's actually quite scary, and for once you feel for the Characters.  That's why you should see this movie.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy was miscast in the film.  He doesn't have a face you can trust.  From the outset he always looks like something is a bit off.  His character only works when he goes psychotic near the end and because the film doesn't waste time on his back-story and you're not quite sure what he has up his sleeve.  His motivations seem silly.  What is his motive? Why is he after Lisa?  What does fulfilling his ultimate objective have to do with any of this?  And most importantly why get a ton of people involved with a plan that at the very least will fail because it's just plain stupid? Without personal  motive he's just a brash guy who kidnaps a girl, and what's so interesting about that?  The part really calls for someone more charming.  This film needs a Brad Pitt and yet it gives us a poor man's Norman Bates.<br /><br />But Rachael McAdams shines as the young strong-willed women whose not afraid to talk back.  Some have said Ms. McAdams is my generation's Julia Roberts.  She just may be, but that is because she's good at what she does.  Her scenes in the airport near the end while preposterous work because she's believable.  Her performance overcomes the entire film, and adds some realism in a film that misses the mark so many times.<br /><br />The other thing the film fails on is consistent tone.  Some scenes are far too dark, and others way to light.  I guess it's the way to handle the material and still hold onto the  PG-13 rating.  But when Craven jumps from drama to comedy, it's a little to jarring for my taste.  It also ends on a dumb joke, that renders the film far silly for its own good.<br /><br />RED EYE is the kind of movie that fails, but has enough talent and good charm.  It tries hard with very little and in the end will probably be considered one the most riveting and yet forgettable movies of 2005.<br /><br />***1/2 out of 5</p></body></html>

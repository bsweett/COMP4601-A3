<meta name="summary" content="Thinking about buying the VHS instead of DVD ?"></head><body><p>Go ahead and buy the VHS version of this if you find it cheap. I was worried that I would not get the same movie theater effect, but the VHS is rather good. <p>At the end of the VHS there is: A short trailer for Revolutions, and a Director's interview of 4 TV commericals that used the matrix theme. You get all this on the VHS version. Therefore you don't have to struggle with cumbersome menu commands, or insert Disk 2.<p>Don't be adicted to DVDs. Save some money.</p></body></html>

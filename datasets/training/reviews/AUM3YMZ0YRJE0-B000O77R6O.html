<meta name="summary" content="solid scifi that mixes grief and spirituality"></head><body><p>This is one of those complex films that, if you want to, is very fun to see over and over and contemplate its meaning.  In this respect, it is very much akin to 2001, though focuses on the love that a couple shares across time and space.  The first time frame is colonial Spain, right smack in the worst excesses of the Reformation.  A brave aristocrat (Jackman) is sent on a mission by the beleaguered queen (Weisz), on a mission to find the tree of life that has been hidden by Mayan priests; this tree is said to offer eternal life in the mythologies of both peoples, but in different ways.  The second time is the present, when a research doctor is searching for a cure for the cancer that is killing his wife, a writer whose story covers that of the Spanish and the next one, the quest of a man flying to a dying star, in accordance with Mayan prophesy; he is transporting the tree, which is failing, and lives with the memory of his wife who is long since dead.<br /><br />From the film, it is impossible to tell what is real, what is imagined, and what it means.  The tree appears in all 3 sequences, as do the characters, who may or may not be the same individuals.  The themes - of love, loss, and hope - are present in all times, where the link of new life to death is apparent and mysterious.  During the entire film, I was able to forget my real life and wonder at the questions and ideas that the film offered, which is an extremely rare experience for me and marks the film as a great success.  The grief and struggle are very moving, the images of merging into light, of killing, of rebirth, are spectacular.<br /><br />According to the extras, this was toned down from the original, which was supposed to have Brad Pitt (one of the most over-rated actors, IMHO) rather than Jackman; Weisz replaced Cate Blanchett.  This version is completely successful, with a consistent mood, quality images, and excellent acting.<br /><br />Recommended for those who enjoy thinking about scifi, who delight at letting characters and concepts gain a place in their imagination.</p></body></html>

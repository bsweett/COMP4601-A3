No matter how you slice it, that little boy is going to spend the rest of his life viewing gruesome deaths everywhere he goes, with no escape. And he will always be totally alone because, unless he manages to find someone who shares his sixth sense, he will never have anyone to talk to about this, nor will anyone be able to understand him. That's a lot for anyone to handle for their entire life, no matter how much you might initially be resolved to the idea of the talent as a 'gift'.<br /><br />I guess what I'm saying is that I found "The Sixth Sense" scary because it scared me on a deeply mental level, and didn't just startle me. And I was deeply intrigued by "The Happening" because it seemed like the same type of 'smart horror' that would scare me in a similar manner. Unfortunately, Shyamalan seems to have decided to trade 'scary' for 'startling', because while "The Happening" has definite scary potential, it seems regularly eager to trade that in for cheap startles. The blood and gore are, in my mind, excessive and it's hard to escape the feeling that the blood'n'guts were added in a cynical attempt to boost sales with an 'R' rating. Pacing and suspense are almost completely thrown away from the very beginning - within a mere minutes of the movie's opening, the scientists on the telly have already nailed down that the incidents are localized around parks and other flora-heavy areas, that the infection is airborne, that it compels people to suicide, and that it probably isn't terrorist-related. This onslaught of information prevents the viewer from building up any kind of suspense regarding the incidents and all we are left with is the characters to care about.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the characters are where "The Happening" is weakest. The acting is just horrible, really every line seems deadpan and every facial expression seems wooden and unnatural. Wahlberg in particular is intensely awful, and what was up with his opening classroom spiel? Even the creationist teachers at my private elementary schools didn't let us scribble "Gawd did it" on our homework and call it a day, but Wahlberg seems perfectly at peace with teaching his students that not only will they never understand nature fully, they shouldn't even try. Beyond that, there's the usual horror movie fare of "rapid escape is essential, so let me just stop to pack some trinkets," not to be overshadowed by the "I know my loved one is dead, but I have to try to find them anyway, leaving my child in the hands of childless strangers who need a new adopted kid to cement their troubled marriage".<br /><br />A lot about this movie just doesn't feel realistic, and that hurts the 'scary potential' even worse - it's hard to be scared to the point of sleeplessness when it all feels so fake. I don't mean the little stuff like the train stopping because they "lost contact" (how?) or the fact that houses and automobiles are generally not air-tight. I mean the big stuff, the stuff that after 9-11 or SARS, movie-makers should really be aware of. Specifically, the ending seems completely unrealistic - for months after 9-11, people in relatively minor cities were still stockpiling water and planning bomb shelters. Faced with something so much bigger, the response would be incredible. Air-tight shelters would be constructed, air masks would be worn, whole forests would be burned down by vigilante militia groups. Which isn't even delving into the fact that the responses of the people DURING the crisis seem pretty unrealistic as well - it's a plague that makes you kill yourself, so people are arming themselves with guns for protection? Gee, that seems kind of like a bad idea.<br /><br />In the end, I was deeply disappointed by "The Happening". The movie was definitely startling, but it failed ultimately to be scary. Partly because it revealed too much too quickly, partly because the acting and characterization were awful, and partly because the movie seems all to willing to believe that movie-goers won't appreciate anything without a bucket of fake guts tossed all over the camera.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></body></html>

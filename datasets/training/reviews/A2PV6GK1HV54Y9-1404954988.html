The only thing wrong with this film is the long dialogue, the characters speak too wordy and the scenes are too dragged out, the editor needed to cut the scenes better. The cast is quite good, an impressive performance by Sandler but who really steals the show is Leoni, her comic timing and flawless delivery is the main reason to watch this film. Cloris Leachman and Pas Vega are wonderful as well, defintely one to see, enjoy!</p></body></html>

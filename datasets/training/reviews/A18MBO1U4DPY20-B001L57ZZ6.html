One hour into the film, I was hoping it wouldn't stretch too long. Not because I was sleepy but because I realized what a poor script it is. And just when I started to think this Shia guy isn't as bad as I've always thought he was, I realized he is what is wrong with this film. The film is not clever at all. There are many scenes that last for less than one second, almost all are action filled. In the second half, it is a jumble of storylines, twists, concerned eyes, speed and self loveth logic. The actress was horried and so was pretty much everyone invovled in the plot. I don't understand what is wrong with three of my friends who loved this film. The lowest rating they gave it was an 8/10 and they almost looked hurt when I told them what I thought.<br /><br />Shia is not a good actor. He should go back and get a degree or two and try to save our economy. The actress has bad skin and made it difficult for me to concentrate on her dialogues. The film never really settles down and when it does it looks campy, cheesy and torturous. Believe me, by no strength of imagination am I the sort of person who considers his time of prime importance, but this film gave me quite a moodswing.<br /><br />I know it will be a hit and I'm happy the producers will get there money worth. I realize I like the other two films by the actor more. I think it was a waste of good resources. Wanted was better and tolerable.<br /><br />This is the sort of film that will make it big on movie rentals but it's just so badly directed.<br /><br />I loved Billy Bob Thorton in The Man Who Wasn't There but I must say the man gets really silly roles and aside from the Coen brothers collaboration, he hasn't done one single worthy film.<br /><br />I rest my case, the Entourage episode in the morning was today's highlight.<br /><br />bye.</p></body></html>

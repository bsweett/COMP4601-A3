<meta name="summary" content="The ULTIMATE Superman movie!!"></head><body><p>This is the absolute best &quot;Superman&quot; film of all time because you get to see how it all started. You get to see Superman's father, Jor-El (played by an astonishing Marlon Brando), and you also get to see how his earlier life had been before he wore the red cape and blue. And no one could ask for a better Superman than Christopher Reeve. Reeve just blows the competition out of the water as the Man of Steel. Also, &quot;Superman&quot; has some comic relief from Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor and Ned Beatty as his bumbling sidekick, Otis. But also, this film has a soft side when Superman falls for Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). This is the ultimate Superman movie for years to come, with action, romance, laughs, and a great storyline, this movie has it all. And the top-notch directing from Richard Donner (before &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;) has never been better. Also the special features on the DVD are outstanding!! Especially the screen tests, trailers, and the deleted scenes. I urge anyone out there to OWN THIS FILM, whether it's on DVD or VHS, own it! Like I said, this IS the best Superman film to date, there will be no other film like this.</p></body></html>

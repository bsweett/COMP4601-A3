And, if you haven't read the book, there's plenty of plot SPOILERS.<br /><br />Having read all of the books at least three times each, I'm a bonafide fan of Harry Potter. And, as the end draws near for this book series, I'm starting to wonder what life would be like without a new Potter entry to look forward to. For years now, with each additional chapter in the life of the Boy Who Lived, J.K. Rowling has brought anticipation and glee into my life. But it's almost done now. It's a reality which looms ever closer, even as Warner Brothers, already looking ahead and thirsting for that next blockbuster franchise, stakes its claim on children's author Angie Sage's Septimus Heap series. Life will go on, of course, because, in the scheme of things, it's really not that big of a deal. And, sure as rain, something'll come to fill in that void, although I doubt it'll be Septimus Heap. Meanwhile, there's this movie that just came out.<br /><br />HARRY POTTER & THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, at a running time of 2 hours and 18 minutes, dares to be briefer than the other Potter films. It's also even darker as it deals quite heftily with Harry's volatile teenaged angst, as well as the steadily worsening climate in the Potter universe. In the prior film, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6EK3S">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Two-Disc Special Edition) (Harry Potter 4)</a>, Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) returned to the flesh and celebrated the act with murder. He even had a magical tussle with Harry. But, as ORDER OF THE PHOENIX commences, it's evident as hell that no one but a loyal few believes Harry's story. As Harry later pens to his godfather Sirius Black, even though Harry is back at Hogwarts, he has never felt more alone.<br /><br />The movie begins, of course, with Harry pining and resenting away in sweltering London (his buds have been incommunicado). When he's forced to utilize his Patronus charm on two Dementors to save himself and his bullying cousin Dudley, this becomes a frowned-upon feat deemed worthy of expulsion from Hogwarts. He does get out of that scrape, thanks to a strangely distant Dumbledore, who pleads Harry's case to the Ministry of Magic and then stalks away, leaving Harry futilely calling out his name. Reinstated at Hogwarts, Harry continues to have nightmares about a mysterious door, which then leads him to believe that he has a frightening mental link to Lord Voldemort. Too, Harry's hormones are raging and he persists in a foul mood until an unexpected new friend straightens him out.<br /><br />Meanwhile, all is not right at Hogwarts. The head of the Ministry of Magic, paranoid in these nerve-wracking times and fearing Dumbledore's vast influence, gets a foot in Hogwarts' door by assigning a toadie as the school's new  teacher for Defense Against the Dark Arts. This person is Dolores Umbridge, officious and pink-clad. Professor Umbridge, breathily vile and prim-and-properly vindictive, does away altogether with practical, hands-on magic learning and, in one quietly chilling scene, punishes Harry for being outspoken. As her status at Hogwarts grows, it becomes clear that, with apologies to Lord Voldemort, Dolores Umbridge is the true centerpiece villain of the film.<br /><br />Somewhat lurking in the background, the Order of the Phoenix - the secret society formed to combat and foil Lord Voldemort - continues to affect Harry's life, as more than a few of its members consist of folks near and dear to Harry. The Order makes noise in the beginning and in the climax, but disappears somewhat in the film's middle as the focus shifts to the doings in school. Hermione, alarmed that the students are rendered vulnerable with the lack of training, convinces a reluctant Harry to become, on the sly, their new teacher for Defense Against the Dark Arts. These students call themselves Dumbledore's Army, the core members of which will be later severely tested in a life-or-death wizardly struggle. But, before that, they still have to pass their O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels) exams.<br /><br />I went into this screening pretty stoked but not as excited as I perhaps could've been. I was much aware that this film is the lesser of the two upcoming, back-to-back Harry Potter events. Make no mistake, the seventh book is the BIGGER deal and the knowledge of its imminent release took some gloss away from my excitement in this film.<br /><br />Yet, I liked this film, and very much. I like it almost as much as the 3rd and 4th installments, which I thought were the best ones. So, with a few caveats, HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX is a very worthwhile entry in the series. The innocence is gone in this series, of course, having been irrevocably crushed with Cedric Diggory's murder in the GOBLET OF FIRE. Absolutely, the films faithfully echo the progressively grimmer tone and mood of the books. And this one is the darkest yet. However, the film still carries moments of zest, such as the Weasley twins' liberating final act of defiance (but where were the swamps?). On occasion, it still cavorts in enchanted whimsy (Umbridge's commemorative plates of cats, the students' Patronus guises). The special effects remain spectacular and, particularly in this movie, serve to briskly move the plot along.<br /><br />The kids are growing up. What we have here is a Harry who's portrayed as realistically as you can get, given the fantastic world he inhabits. Daniel Radcliffe flexes his acting chops and simmers and glowers as young Harry, now fifteen but feeling more isolated than ever and going thru what every fifteen-year-olds go thru, except more so. The rest of the kids are maturing nicely, with Emma Watson still leading the pack in terms of presence and quality of performance. Rupert Grint, he ain't bad, either. Newcomer Evanna Lynch as the wonderfully wonky Luna Lovegood is a welcome addition (but, what is a "nargle," exactly?). The last of the kids to make an impression is Matthew Lewis as the hapless Neville Longbottom, for whom I believe J .K. Rowling has plans.<br /><br />All Shakespearean stage and film adaptations in England must've been put on the backburner as just about every middle-aged Brit actor seems to have poked his or her head thru this particular door (What's Patrick Stewart waiting for?). Not enough of the old reliables get decent screen time, mind you, but Imelda Staunton as  Dolores Umbridge does much to make up for that. I haven't seen anyone convey such sadistic, yet oh-so-polite bureaucractic malice since the last time I was at the DMV. Meanwhile, Helena Bonham Carter, also a freshman here, simply revels in gothic villainy as the unhinged Bellatrix Lestrange. More of her would've been a very good thing.<br /><br />No, it's not a perfect film. It's definitely not for newcomers to the Harry Potter mythos or for those who haven't read the books. The scene transitions are sometimes choppy and disconcerting. People show up without an intro and move in and out of the screen, leaving the audience to follow along, which is no biggie for the constant reader/viewer but might leave rookies to the series scratching their heads. I walked away with this feeling that the film was too short and a bit abrupt. With the book nearly at 900 pages, there's simply no way to include and then amply cover all the fun stuff and the key moments. Frankly, I expected more of the Weasly twins' final rebellious prank at Hogwarts, but, alas, there wasn't enough all-out anarchy in their festivities. Also, an important element - Sirius's growing recklessness and feelings of moroseness and futility - is barely touched on. Not to mention, the film deals differently with the ferreting out of Dumbledore's Army. And not enough Room of Requirement. But the most galling thing about this film (and the book, too, come to think of it): no friggin' Quidditch! But, you do get to see Harry and Cho snogging under a mistletoe.<br /><br />Enough of my yak. This is a four star motion picture, leaner and meaner, starring your favorite, lightning scarred boy wizard. The film series has now gotten to that stage where sleeves are tugged up and knuckles are cracked, all in preparation for some serious work ahead. Time to get down and dirty. So, climb onboard. The end may be around the corner, but, for now, the series is picking up some serious momentum.<br /><br />Meanwhile, make sure the nargles are kept away, whatever they are.</p></body></html>

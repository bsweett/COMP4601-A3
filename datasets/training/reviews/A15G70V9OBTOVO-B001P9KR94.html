<meta name="summary" content="A Disney movie for adults."></head><body><p>Although desperately poor, Jamal has something most of us don't.  He knows exactly what and who he wants.  Of course, it doesn't hurt that Latika is adorable as a child and breathtakingly beautiful as an adult but this just the way Hollywood used to do it.  The plot may be the oldest in the world but the use of the Millionaire show makes it fresh.<br /><br />On top of this, the movie is extraordinarily well put together.  An entire story, told in flashbacks yet not at all confusing.  Perfectly paced too, with the suspense building to that final cell phone call.<br /><br />Was it the best movie of the year? Not really.  But perhaps, just as the stars aligned for Jamal, audiences were ready for a break from the mostly vulgar chick flicks, prequels, comic books and Armageddon that Hollywood shovels at us.<br /><br />I'd almost go for 5 stars but for one misstep.  Everyone I talk to remarks about the children being tortured.  Of course one can't overcome evil if there is no evil, but this is not the thing people should take away from this uplifting film.</p></body></html>

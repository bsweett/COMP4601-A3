<meta name="summary" content="Lonesome Dove Revisited"></head><body><p>Kevin Costner's 2003 western starring himself and Robert Duvall as two open range cowboys who cross paths with a closed-field town. The town's cattle baron doesn't want the land trampled by free-ranging Texas longhorns and, without surprise, uses the local sheriff to do his dirty work. A love interest also arises and our protagonists refuse to leave until all scores are settled.<br /><br />  Although decently acted and directed, the story itself is nothing more than the generic western script: good cowboys vs. bad cowboys; the corrupt town sheriff and his posse; the damsel in distress being harassed by the antagonists. Such plots and themes were antiquated even before John Wayne and 'Stagecoach'. Robert Duvall is simply replaying the role he performed so well in the mini-series 'Lonesome Dove' while Costner does a rehash of his Wyatt Earp or 'Dances with Wolves' character. The film does have a good shootout scene near the end to complete the climax of the film but that's about it.<br /><br />  A good movie to rent but not terribly original. You probably would get more of your money's worth in buying westerns such as Sergio Leone's 'spaghetti' films, Sam Peckinpah's 'The Wild Bunch', or Clint Eastwood westerns such as 'The Outlaw Josey Wales.'</p></body></html>

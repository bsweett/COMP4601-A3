Harrison Ford is a great actor, in Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Air Force One and so many other movies he was great.  Hes not bad in Firewall either but the difference is that the aforementioned movies were good.  Firewall takes from so many movies and has been done before it becomes boring.  They use every bit of heroism in Ford to make this movie passable.  If your a huge fan of Ford rent it, because you won't want to buy it.</p></body></html>

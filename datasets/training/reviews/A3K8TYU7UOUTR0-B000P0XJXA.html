After one or two rhythmic, staccato exchanges of dialogue, Mamet's script writing fingerprints all but glow of the screen. When Mamet has his mojo working, his dialogue is lean and concise as haiku written in cool code (Glengarry Glen Ross, Things Change), but beware when he misses (Heist). Then it's like listening to a rejected radio play from the thirties. I was happy that he hit the mark with Spartan. There are only one are two times when his dialogue bordered on macho-embarrassing, but the movie has such tremendous forward momentum that it become part of the fun. <p>Briefly, the film tells the tale of a secret agent (Val Kilmer) from one of those Government organizations that have no name (do they really exist or was it just too convenient a construct for Hollywood not to invent?). The agent, who is called Scott, must retrieve the president's missing daughter. Of course, all is not what it seems. <p>Several things make this DVD worthy of purchase and re-watching:<p>First, as I have said, the movie has tremendous speed. I found myself not being bored for a single second. Every frame of film time has value, and the action scenes are expertly done and believable. It seems to have been Mamet's goal in this movie to really hammer down the film's editing and dialogue to the naked essentials. The men (and one woman) move in this film with a horrible efficiency toward a single goal. In Val Kilmer's commentary track in the special features, he said the characters reminded him of &quot;hunting dogs,&quot; and that is a perfect analogy. Kilmer's character and his co-workers move like a one-minded pack scenting blood. <p>Also, the film is beautiful to look at. The camera work is very creative and manages to convey a tight, claustrophobic world of tremendous pressure. Shadows loom and stretch across the ground, up the sides of buildings, across faces. The palate is one of hard blue steel and shiny black where rich, primary colors are often reflected on polished surfaces. Everything, including the faces, captures the light of chrome. <p>Lastly, the performances:<p>I will say up front I am a Val Kilmer fan (it is a great shame that Kilmer's current reputation in Hollywood seems to require that one admit that &quot;up front&quot;). For whatever reason, he seems to have been struggling a bit lately. Hollywood gossip has it that he is nearly impossible to work with, and that the big boys are calling him less just to avoid his ego. Whatever. I find him watchable in nearly everything he's ever done. He has an odd poise as an actor - the ability to take his time with a line or a character, never rushing or histrionic. He has a certain control that really conveys confidence without the need for extravagance. I find this quality very unique today (is anybody else getting tired of Sean Penn, as gifted as he is, blubbering and flailing through every role?)<p>As a special treat, the much underused Ed O'Neil makes an appearance as &quot;Burch,&quot; clearly the leader of these nameless men of a nameless organization. Watch O'Neil's eyes during his first scenes. This is one hunting dog whose brain has filled with the scent of the wounded.  -Mykal Banta</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="this is modern but without a soul"></head><body><p>The original 'clash of the titans' is a fanstastic movie story wise. Some dumb people today might criticize the old style effects which were fading away quickly but were a artform in themselves: stop motion animation that is, in fact by the time I met a effects guy from hollywood,  who was dying of lung cancer in 1995, and who had worked on lots of these movies going back to the 50's, it was gone even from the lowest budget movies. This one has the modern cgi effects that were undreamed of in the originals 1980 movie, but it has no soul, it's like a mindless movie without any characterization or depth. The first one has characters that matter though. THis is still enjoyable in that we watch these greek heroes battle fierce mythological creatures with fantastic modern effects. Which are not as true a artform s the stop motion stuff but still looks more realistic. It's just that they didn't understand what made the first one a hit was the acting and characters. You had alot of great actors in the first one and a fun telling , here it's little talking and lots of action , this is a b movie with a higher budget and that's ok though. Still I remember the classic and can't give it more than three stars.  the blu ray looks awesome though!  Blu ray is usually the only way to go and that's true here for certain.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Story About Vengeance"></head><body><p>This film was "inspired by real events" which suggests more fiction than "based on true events". Young men climb over a fence to get to the Olympic village; are they up to no good? Yes, they are the terrorists who captured Israeli athletes as hostages during the 1972 Olympics in Munich. All eleven athletes were murdered. Will the Israeli government act in revenge? The precedent was the Eichmann abduction. The decision is made. A team will be formed to implement the decision. Will they use experienced agents or new men who won't be known? This is the story about the reprisals taken against the "Black September" leaders for the eleven dead.<br /><br />The dinner introduces the men on the team. Avner wants t find the location of some men. [James Madison's picture was on the $5,000 bill, the largest in circulation then.] The first target is a man who does translations. The operation had costs. The TV shows the news. Another target is selected. What did they do to that telephone? The next time they plan a new method for night-time. Will this team go to Beirut? What kind of disguise will they use to attack their new target? There is a strange meeting in the country. [This pads the film.] They find a safe house in Athens with mattresses on the floor. Was there a mix-up? Or a dramatic device? There is a foul-up. The next target is in London. Will there be a mistake?<br /><br />Did Carl trust the wrong person? Is it time for them to move out? They visit a houseboat. Those who were eliminated are just replaced by worse men. One of their team was found on a park bench. They must be more careful now. One man wasn't. There is another failure. Avner returns as if nothing happened. "What did you learn?" Was there a betrayal? What will he do next? Is he being hunted? Was the ending meant to be ironic? Does killing affect the killers psychologically? No therapy mentioned in this story.<br /><br />I remember a scandal when a Palestinian waiter in Sweden was assassinated because he resembled someone who was on the Israeli target list. This is an example of the problem of sanctioned killing: there is no attempt at any trial to determine if the suspect is actually the perpetrator! This film subtly criticizes this operation by showing how the alleged guilty were people whose names were given out for money. This same criticism was made about George W. Bush's policy of abducting people and putting them in prison at Guantanamo Bay.<br />Some of the scenes in this film lack classic good taste.</p></body></html>

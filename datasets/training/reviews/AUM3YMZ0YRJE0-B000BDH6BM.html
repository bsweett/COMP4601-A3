<meta name="summary" content="falls short on credibility"></head><body><p>The premise of this film is good:  four adoptive bothers meet to unravel and then seek revenge for a seemingly meaningless killing in a rough urban scene.  The actors are also very good, starting with Wahlberg, who carries an entire environment in the roles he chooses.  Unfortunately, as the story unfolds, I felt that it became almost comicbook-like in the way that it cut corners:  there is rampaging violence with little consequence, like even taking suspects into the police station for questioning (except when it advances the plot); the characters slowly lose credibility as they take smarter and smarter actions; and the ending has not one but two deus ex machina devices that ruin the remaining realism.<br /><br />What the film becomes is a kind of shoot'em up cowboy movie, with an icing of realism implied.  At that, it isn't too bad, but it is entertainment when it could have been a much much finer film.  Not recommended.</p></body></html>

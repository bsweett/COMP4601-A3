Any time a major character dies, you have to wonder about how they're going to bring them back, but this character's death isn't a "Mr. Spock" kind of death...it's definitely a "Captain Kirk" dead-and-gone way to do it.  While I hate to see a character develop for 15 years and then be wiped clean in an instant, in this case the character's death makes sense, and they go out in the most heroic manner I've seen through any of the films or tv shows.  It's hard to believe the new crew is gone, but I guess the Paramount folks figured it was best to give these folks a rest and move on to their other two major ST franchises of Voyager and DS9.  Maybe for the next film we can see the remaining characters of all 3 series (Enterprise just doesn't count) get together to find Sisko or something.  Yes, this movie has it's cameos from Wesley Crusher (non-speaking, thank goodness) and Guinan too just for good measure.  And it's good to see Ryker finally taking a ship of his own (I didn't give anything away - that's revealed in the first 5 minutes of the movie).  The villian in this one is so subdued with that inner smoldering anger that he's almost comatose.  He definitely ain't no Khan, that's for sure.  I highly recommend this movie though and I eagerly await the next one in the series!  Way to go guys, and goodbye ______ (I'm not going to give it away).</p></body></html>

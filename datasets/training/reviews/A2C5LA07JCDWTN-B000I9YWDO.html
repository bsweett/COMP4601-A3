<meta name="summary" content=""Hey Milton...What's Going On...""></head><body><p>Gary Cole is the heart and soul of Mike Judge's Office Space. His portrayal of Bill Lundberg (SP?) is so dead-on it is just hilarious to watch. Ron Livingston plays Peter Gibbons, an everyday 9 to 5 computer programmer for Initech. He hates his job and the whole rat race that surrounds it. In fact, all he really wants to do is watch Kung Fu with his super hot girlfriend played by Jennifer Aniston. So after being somewhat hypnotized during a therapy session, Peter decides to just stop going to work or going on his own terms which leads to hilarious results. Peter's cadre of co-workers include his underappreciated buddies Samir and Michael Bolton. When Peter learns that Initech plans to fire Samir and Michael, they hatch a scheme to rip off the company. If you've ever hated your job or felt trapped in a terrible company then you will definitely relate to Office Space. You may also recognize Milton (the office psycho) as the nerdy fat guy from dodgeball. Milton loves his red swingline stapler and playing his music at a reasonable volume. Diedrich Bader is also hilarious as Peter's neighbor Lawrence. Anyway, this movie is laugh out loud funny and a great addition to any DVD collection. Recommended.</p></body></html>

Pixar takes basically the same technology as "Toy Story II", probably added some improvements, and brings us another visual delight.  This one should be a big success on video, as kids are going to love it in their libraries.<p>But of course, it wouldn't mean beans if there were not a good story.  This one creates a brand new world for us.  I wasn't aware of this but it seems that the monsters that hide in our closets have a back exit that leads into their own world.  In this world, scaring kids is just another day at work, and they punch a clock in the same manner that we do.  They are not bad monsters for scaring us, it's just what they do.  <p>So everything is going fine until an actual kid get's into the monsters' world and gums everything up.  Turns out the monsters, at least our leading monsters, are really good guys who just scare kids as a job.  When they encounter the child, who THEIR world considers the monsters, a lot of prejudice has to be overcome.  But once they accept they child, protective instincts take over, and they try to put everything back in it's place.  This, of course, entails all kinds of difficulties, which entertain us enough to make this one a keeper.</p></body></html>

Michael Douglas plays crack SS agent Jack, who took a bullet for Reagan and is still the president's top protector.  (The president is played by Sledgehammer himself, David Rasche, looking a lot like William Devane).  Jack is also having an affair with the first lady (the ever lovely Kim Basinger).  A plot is revealed to Jack that someone within the SS is plotting on assassinating the president.  When Jack flunks his lie detector test (because of his involvement with Kim), suspicion falls on him, and his former friend/partner Kiefer Sutherland is hot on his trail, especially since he believes Jack had an affair with his own wife which ended their friendship.  DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES' Eva Longoria is the rookie agent working with Kiefer, and he role is hardly noticeable at all.  Director Clark Johnson keeps things moving well but this was done much better in Clint Eastwood's earlier IN THE LINE OF FIRE.  Discerning viewers who know which actors almost always play villains will recognize the mole right away..you'd think casting directors would go for less obvious actors, guys who play good guys so you don't always spot the villain right away.  But THE SENTINEL is entertaining, just not innovative.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Zombie film of the year."></head><body><p>Well, it was the only zombie film of 2002 but who cares? Okay, in a lab, a group of scientest are studying to do, well I forget. Anyway they fail, bcause in the middle of the process they drop there project and it turns them into the living dead a.k.a. zombies. A govrment group was sent to destroy the scienst, but when they get there all the scientest are all ready zombies. Cool plot huh? The main actress Milla Jovovich is really good( cute to). The film is never really slow and is entertaiting. Brought zombie film back to life, you can tell with 2003 Undead and 2004 Dawn of the Dead. Can't wait for the sequel.(P.S. If you want to get house of the dead because you liked this and it sounds sort of like this, don't)</p></body></html>

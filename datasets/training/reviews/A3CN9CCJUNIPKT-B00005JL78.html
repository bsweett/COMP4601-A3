I was surprised by what a good job Steven Spielberg did directing past Tom Cruise's overstuffed ego, and I thought the dystopian sci-fi future he came up with was kind of interesting, but ultimately this didn't really hang together that well.  The premise of the psychics used by the police state didn't quite make sense, and the run-and-hide phase of the film seemed interminable and choppily paced.  Also: when the super-duper cyberstate turns against you, don't they kind of automatically turn off your access cards and top-security passes?  Why was Cruise's cop character still able to get into restricted areas if they were able to track his every move?  Visually, this had its fine points, but again, I felt like the direction was a little too loose... The gee-whiz scene at hte beginning with Cruise waving his magic VR gloves and making the hi-tech computer images dance goes on way too long; like many things in this film, it could have stood a little tightening up.  I did enjoy Spielberg's small, goofy slapstick moments, though.  It was great to see a big, mega-blockbuster filmmaker still able to pause and take time out for a well-timed gag or two.  This was ok, but it could have been better.</p></body></html>

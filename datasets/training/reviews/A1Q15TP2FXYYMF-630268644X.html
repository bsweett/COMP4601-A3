<meta name="summary" content="Tarrantino Works His Magic In His Dark Debut"></head><body><p>It's taken five films to make Quentin Tarantino an official directing genius. Although the quality of some of his films are debatable, Tarantino's made his work into a cult. The question is, where to start watching them? The best bet is to start where it all began, with Reservoir Dogs.<br /><br />Six expert criminals, going under alias names according to colour, are hired by a mob boss, Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) and his son, Eddie (Chris Penn) to rob a bank. The heist goes wrong and in the confusion, the criminals make their own seperate ways to the rendezvous, an abandoned warehouse. From the start, the film is in real-time, but is heavily interspersed by flashbacks telling the stories of each character. Seemingly a simple plot, Reservoir Dogs is intelligent film making at its pure best.<br /><br />Reservoir Dogs is packed to bursting with a tense and intriguing storyline for its whole 90 minutes. It is a film that is so accomplished that it is able to give the viewer an attachment to the characters in such a short space of time. Amidst the sharp, dark and insanely witty dialogue, you get a three-dimensional insight into these criminals through Tarantino's sheer genius in scene structure. There are a host of scenes that are accomplished in just a few shots - one camera angle often holds for several minutes, but yet, Tarantino still makes it feel all the more cinematic and theatrical, showing off the talents of actors such as Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi. The background stories of the characters are fittingly summarised and neatly slotted into the flow of the film without disrupting it.<br /><br />The acting on show here is superb, ranging from an empathetic Harvey Keitel, to a sharp, mocking Steve Buscemi, to a loyal loudmouth Chris Penn, to the silent Tim Roth, and to top it off, a collected, psychopathic Michael Madsen. They intergrate into the scenes perfectly, which vary from light-hearted conversations, to tense situations, but there are so many blackly funny moments in Reservoir Dogs that it comes to the point where you may be seeing something insanely sick, leading you to not know whether to laugh or recoil in disgust.<br /><br />Reservoir Dogs is an experience that is worth going through more than once. The first time, as with most times, you'll watch it and be entertained by it, but give it a few viewings and you'll understand and be entertained by it, which is when the realisation of this magic in film will hit you. Although essentially not a film for the light-hearted, Reservoir Dogs is a cult classic, riddled with violence, sharp dialogue, hugely clever sequences, and plenty of expletive ...</p></body></html>

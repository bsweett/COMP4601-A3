For even after all the trouble he had with an adulterous romance in "Fatal Attraction," here he is in "The Sentinel" playing the role of Pete Garrison, a veteran secret service agent who's having an affair with none other than the First Lady of the United States.  Even worse, when it is discovered that there may be a mole secretly operating in the service, the finger of suspicion begins to point directly at Mr. Garrison.  Is he truly the undercover operative working to bring down the President, or is he merely a tool being set up as a convenient fall guy in a plot to rub out the nation`s chief executive?<br /><br />Based on the novel by Gerald Petievich, "The Sentinel" is a decent enough thriller set in the high stakes world of political assassination.  Although it frequently strains credibility, gets lost in a maze of cyber/techno mumbo jumbo, and succumbs to a few too many man-on-the-run cliches, the movie still manages to generate enough mystery and suspense to see us through most of its many rough patches.  Prime credit goes to Douglas, who after all these years, could clearly do these roles in his sleep, and to Keifer Sutherland, who plays a fellow agent with personal reasons for doubting Garrison's probity and loyalty to the institution.  Kim Basinger also does a fine job as the beautiful First Lady torn between duty towards her husband and the man she loves.<br /><br />You'll probably forget this movie the moment you walk out of the theater, but you should have a reasonably fun time while you`re still in your seat.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hellraiser, part 1 (1987)"></head><body><p>British writer Clive Barker makes his directorial debut with "Hellraiser", based upon a story he wrote.<br /><br />The story is about a couple Larry and Julia who relocate into an old house, owned by the husband's family member, who recently died.  Together they are eager to start a fresh life away from the city.  Larry's daughter Kirsty also has moved out and is starting to live on her own.<br /><br />Unknown to them, Larry's half-brother Frank (who had disappeared years earlier) is now living in the attic of the house; barely able to breathe in his half rotten body.  He has recently escaped the Cenobites, sadistic messengers of evil from hell.  Years earlier, Frank had discovered a magic box which would give him all the desires of his flesh.  It would come with a price though- he would experience pain, through the Cenobites' relentless torture.  Frank opened the box and entered into the dark spirit world.<br /><br />Julia discovers Frank in the attic.  Frank informs her that he needs dead bodies to feed off of to complete his transformation and to be made completely well again.  Since they were former lovers, she agrees to help him.  She seduces strangers in bars and brings them back to her house, taking them to the attic.  Then Frank kills them, sucking all the flesh from them so that he will be given more.<br /><br />The plot of Julia and Frank goes well, until Kirsty discovers Frank in the attic and the steals the box from him.  She escapes the house and runs away.  She passes out in a downtown area.  When she wakes she is in a hospital, the box by her side.  Out of curiosity, she manages to open it, and then the Cenobites arrive in her hospital.  She tours a fantasy nightamre world of pain and horror, escaping from one of the four Cenobites.<br /><br />Eager to tell her father about the dangers of Frank and the Cenobites she rushes back home to inform him.....<br /><br />* you'll have to watch the end of the movie to see how this conflict plays out.  I liked the actors in this film (Clare Higgins, Oliver Smith, Ashley Laurence, and Andrew Robinson).  They do a great job of keeping everything believable in this fantastical story.  The Cenobites are effectively creepy and scary and nightmarish.<br /><br />* highly recommended for the horror fan.  This film was released 23 years ago at the time of this review.  It is now considered a horror classic, and has spawned several sequels.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better Than Flightplan"></head><body><p>This movie is much better than Flightplan the other thriller plane flick that came out shortly after this one. This movie is hinged and succeeds solely on the ability of the two leads, Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are really good in this movie. The story is passable filler with no real thrills but it's decent enough for passing time.Worth a watch, not much else.</p></body></html>

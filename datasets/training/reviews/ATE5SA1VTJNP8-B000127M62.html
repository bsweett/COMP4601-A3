<meta name="summary" content="You Knew Jason Would Win..."></head><body><p>C'mon, since JASON X takes place after the battle Royale, the outcome is kind of obvious (shoulda placed a bet...).<br /><br />I must admit that this was rather effective as a comedy. I was roaring with laughter at the scene where Jason is stalking some losers at Camp Crystal, then all of a sudden he recieves the call to go to Elm Street. Next scene: he's on Elm Street! What the heck? Did he take a cab?<br /><br />They overdid it on the metal music during the fight scenes, and the overall effect was very plastic. Not that I expected an Acadamy Award Nominee (though that would be cool...) but I was hoping they'd try and capture at least some of the darkness that made the early Friday the 13th installments decent.<br /><br />Or they could've just gone all out like they did in JASON X or LEPRACHAUN IN THE HOOD (both classics...) and summon the belly laughs, which they did do in several scenes.<br /><br />Dunno, this will certainly appeal to those who are into WWF and the last few Freddy films, but for those of you who were wondering if maybe, just maybe they reacptured some of the old flame...don't get your hopes up.</p></body></html>

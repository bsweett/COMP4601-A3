Heads shot off. Acid baths. Skin freezing. A drowning pool of decay. Brain surgery. Good old fashion throat slashing.<br /><br />Sound like fun? Then...it's your future...I see Saw III in your Amazon cart!<br /><br />By now the Saw story--whether it's the original, the second or third--should be familiar enough: Jigsaw wants you to appreciate life more. So to get you to do so, he tests you. He wants to play a game....Get through the booby trap infested film and live. Fail, then die. Make your choice.<br /><br />Saw III wraps up some Saw I and Saw II loose ends while seemingly taking us through the perils of Jigsaw's final test subject....Or should I say subjects? And is this the final Saw? Not bloody likely.<br /><br />The first ingredient for a good sequel is when the same writers and directors that did the original return. And they did that in spades for Saw III.<br /><br />Leigh Whannell co-wrote and appeared (as Adam) in all 3. James Wan directed and co-wrote 1, co-produced 2, and co-wrote and produced 3. Darren Lynn Bousman co-wrote and directed 2 and 3. You get the point...all the main creators are still hanging in there.  So "check" for the first ingredient.<br /><br />The second key ingredient is getting all of the key actors back. Check again.<br /><br />Another key ingredient is getting the sequels out relatively close; since 2004 the Saw films have been released in consecutive years. Checkaroo.<br /><br />As for another sequel??? Saw IV is scheduled for this year to keep that consistency going, but Wan and Whannell seem to be the only main guys attaching their names to IV as of today. David Hackl who did some secondary work on 2 & 3 is rumored to be the director.<br /><br />Plus with some key characters seemingly out for any more sequels, the Saw franchise after III looks to perhaps be headed down Friday the 13th Sequel Overkill Road.<br /><br />Regardless, the first three in the series are good...for the genre. But, oh so much torture and gore! Especially in Saw III. Still sane after witnessing all the carnage in just Saw III? Imagine the mind warping of watching all 3 in one weekend. Might want to keep your distance from me...er, uh, I mean...anyone that calls that a fun 6 hours.</p></body></html>

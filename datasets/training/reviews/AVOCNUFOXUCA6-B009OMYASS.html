<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good horror movie"></head><body><p>For all that has been written about how gross Hostel is, I found surprisingly not as gross as I had expected.  The bloody parts don't show up until the second half of the movie, and even then much, if not most, of the horror is in our heads rather than on screen.  Roth wisely lets us imagine what is happening, rather than showing us, while we get to hear it.  As most good horror directors understand, the stuff we can imagine in our heads is at least as scary as what is on the screen.<br /><br />In one of the commentaries, Tarantino notes that Hostel is like a 70s film instead of a big modern Hollywood movie, because 10 minutes into it you don't already know what the ending is going to be.  I definitely agree.  This extends even to which of the friends is going to be the hero of this movie.  You actually go from kind of hoping they're all going to die, because they're doofuses and jerks at the beginning, to actually liking them.  If you like commentaries, there are 4 of them, and they'll keep you busy for a while.<br /><br />Hostel doesn't have a lot of moments of comedy, but there is some comic gold in there, which is what you would expect from the director of "Cabin Fever."<br /><br />Hostel is definitely worth at least a rent by fans of the horror genre, and is a decent choice for others as well.</p></body></html>

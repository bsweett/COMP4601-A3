It is a heartwarming romantic film that winds up being a blast of good cheer for the holidays.  Director Nancy Meyers has one Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304696558">Private Benjamin (Full Screen Edition)</a> and did <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001AVZA8">Something's Gotta Give</a> with Diane Keaton & Jack Nicholson and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXQS">What Women Want</a> with Helen Hunt & Mel Gibson.  She hits the right chords in this romantic genre again.<br /><br />Kate Winslet who was once nominated for a picture titled "Iris" plays the character Iris.  Winslet is an interesting actress who has been nominated for 27 various film awards including 5 Oscars and has only won two smaller awards as Best Supporting Actress for "Iris" by the L.A. Film Critics and for "Sense & Sensibility" by the Screen Actors Guild.  While I think my favorite film performance of hers was in "Finding Neverland," I found it interesting in the DVD extras her comments on how pleased she was to try comedy.  The scene with the split phone call where she has Diaz and Law on the other ends & keeps connecting with the wrong one is hilarious.  She does a charming job throughout the film.<br /><br />Jack Black plays "Miles."  I think I will always think of him as the guy who Bruce Willis blows his arm off in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783226888">The Jackal - Collector's Edition</a>.  Seeing him as an offbeat romantic lead was not as great a thrill as seeing him spurt blood and run mindlessly around a meadow.  But hopefully even guys who don't look like Jude Law will be inspired to one day find their true love.  As a film music composer, Black was most interesting in Blockbuster where he knew the scores to random movies.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz has a smile that is as wide as the state of North Carolina.  From her films like "There's Something About Mary," "Being John Malkovich," "Vanilla Sky" & "Gangs of New York," she's shown her ability to fit in a wide number of film genres.  She captures our attention as Amanda who heads off to England after breaking up with Ed Burns' character.<br /><br />Jude Law is impressive as an actor.  He fits into the romantic comedy genre effortlessly as Graham who is a young widowed father with two small children.  The girls who play his kids Sophie and Olivia are darling.  I'm not sure if he clicks as deeply as he did as Inman with Nicole Kidman in "Cold Mountain," but we feel a connection and hope the lovers get together.  (One recent high school graduate who watched the film with me commented that Jude Law & Johnny Depp are God's gift to women.  ...I smiled...)<br /><br />Eli Wallach who was over 90 years old when this was filmed plays Arthur, a screenwriter who Iris connects with while on holiday.  Rufus Sewell from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMH8">Helen of Troy</a> plays Jasper who breaks Iris' heart & tries to keep her on a string.<br /><br />I found it interesting that all of these characters worked for the media from a film trailer editor to a music score composer to a screenwriter to a book editor to a newspaper writer.  While we might have had a variety of occupations like a plumber, a piano tuner or a construction contractor, the similarity of occupation was not a major distraction.<br /><br />I found the interplay between Los Angeles & England to be a delight.  A good love story may not differ that much in its essentials from story to story, but this one is done with great style & lifted my spirits.  I hope it does your too.  Cheers!</p></body></html>

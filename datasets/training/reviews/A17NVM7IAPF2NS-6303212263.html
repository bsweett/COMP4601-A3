<meta name="summary" content="Super MOVIE!!"></head><body><p>Who could not like the film?<p>Gene Hackman's sardonic portrayal, Christopher Reeve's &quot;goody good&quot; Superman role, and Margot Kidder's mind-in-the-clouds Lois Lane are all superb and flawless.<p>Granted, Brando was paid a ridiculous amount of money for reading a couple of lines (w/ top billing to boot).  $3.2 million?  Wow,...I wish I could make that money giving a conference at my work...and I talk more than that!<p>Beautifully-written dialog and a story that goes from origins to potential disaster in a single sweep of a movie is breathtaking and ambitious.  Not many movies (this one is 143 minutes, roughly &quot;uncut&quot;) can catch your attention for that long and leave you yawning.<p>Too bad old Lex couldn't have spent more of his time bald...still, the 70s touch was nice.</p></body></html>

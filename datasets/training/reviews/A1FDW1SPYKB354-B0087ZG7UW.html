<meta name="summary" content=""He Was Always BAD!" -- (But This Movie Certainly Isn't!)"></head><body><p>Ever since first seeing Alfred Hitchcock's masterwork, "Psycho", it has firmly held down a high ranking in my "Top Films Of All-Time" category. "Psycho" began scaring audiences when it first hit theater screens in June 1960, and it's doing the same thing even today, many decades later.<br /><br />This motion picture has a way of "sucking you in" almost right from the start.  I'm not quite sure why, but (for me) when watching "Psycho", I always begin to start squirming in my seat just a wee bit during the film's second scene, when the man with the wad of cash enters Janet Leigh's office. It's a feeling that seems to be inherent to a Hitchcock film.  It's probably part psychological on the part of the viewer.  Since we know we're seeing a Hitchcock picture, we automatically tend to feel slightly ill-at-ease at almost every turn.  Hitch no doubt *knew* his audiences would feel this way, and took advantage of it with a masterful subtleness in much of his direction and in the scripts he ultimately brought to the big screen.<br /><br />The plot in "Psycho" is relatively simple (so it seems), but in the hands of "The Master" (aka: Mr. Hitchcock), the film takes a drastic turn 47 minutes in, with 57% of the movie still in front of us. I'm sure you know what this "turn" entails.  If not, buy this DVD post-haste, because you're one of the very few who evidently has not basked in the beauty of this motion picture.<br /><br />Between Mr. Hitchcock's inimitable style of direction, and that unforgettable Bernard Herrmann music score, how could this film be anything but what it is -- an unsurpassed horror/suspense icon.<br /><br />There's a veritable laundry list of memorable moments in the film that are almost instantly recognized as distinct "Psycho" signatures. Such as -----<br /><br />> The spooky old house on the hill, which seems to be "watching" all that happens below from its lofty perch.<br /><br />> "Bates Motel -- Vacancy".<br /><br />> The staircase.<br /><br />> "Mother" moving past the window.<br /><br />> Marion's "eye".<br /><br />> That knife-stabbing music.<br /><br />> "Cabin 1".<br /><br />> "Mother...m-m-my mother, what is the phrase? She's not quite herself today."<br /><br />> Mrs. Bates in the cellar.<br /><br />> And, of course, that dreaded "shower".<br /><br />All of these set-pieces add up to the whole that is the magnificence of "Psycho".<br /><br />The video quality on this non-anamorphic DVD looks exceptionally good for an older (1998) DVD release.  You can freeze-frame an image in almost perfect, undistorted clarity anywhere on this disc (which is unusual for non-anamorphic video material), indicating a solid transfer.  The image ratio here is the Widescreen OAR (Original Aspect Ratio) of 1.85:1.<br /><br />The audio you hear comes from Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono soundtracks. It would be great if there had also been a Stereo re-mix done here, so that Bernard Herrmann's always-effective music score could be "expanded" upon in the realm of Stereo (or even a Surround Sound format).  Still, this original Mono track does very well for itself.<br /><br />This single-disc DVD "Collector's Edition" of "Psycho" from Universal Studios does the movie proud. It's brimming over with fulfilling bonus supplements, including a scrumptious feature-length documentary, "The Making Of Psycho", which runs for 1 hour and 34 minutes.  This feature is chock-full of useful behind-the-scenes tidbits and goodies that should delight any fan.  I particularly enjoyed the interview segments with "Psycho" screenwriter Joseph Stefano. This "Making Of" is one of the best of its kind to ever come down the pike for any DVD release (IMO).  It's very nearly a "second" movie on this disc.<br /><br />But the producers of this Universal Digital Disc didn't stop with just placing on it a terrific and stylish movie-length documentary feature. No, there's a lot more where that came from.  The disc also contains:<br /><br />>> Newsreel Footage: "The Release Of Psycho". -- This splendid bonus, which has a run time of 7:42, is an "Advanced Press Book on Film" (a quote from this newsreel).  This feature (I assume) was distributed to theaters around the U.S.A. before the film's widespread initial release in the summer of 1960, to demonstrate, as stated in the newsreel, "the care and handling of Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' ". It's a truly fascinating glimpse into the world of promotional advertising for a major motion picture, circa 1960. This short film looks sensational too.  Remarkably pristine and clear.<br /><br />>> The "Shower Scene" (with and without music).<br /><br />>> Multiple Photo Galleries, featuring gobs and gobs of great-looking production stills and poster art from the film.<br /><br />>> "Shower Scene" Storyboards.<br /><br />>> Theatrical Trailers. -- Including the Hitchcock-hosted "Tour of the 'Psycho' Set" Trailer, which is practically a "mini featurette" all by itself, sporting an elaborate running time of 6.5 minutes! One of the lengthiest trailers I can think of.<br /><br />>> Some very detailed text-only sections: "Production Notes" and "Cast And Filmmakers Biographies".<br /><br />Also included is a very handy and informative multi-page, fold-out booklet -- which has Chapter Lists for both the film and the "Making Of" (26 Chapters each), several nice photos, and some very lengthy and informative Production Notes.<br /><br />-------------<br /><br />A closing word (or two).......<br /><br />This classic piece of cinema deserves to be re-visited a minimum of a couple times per year (possibly more if your nerves can tolerate the abuse). And that's easy to do with this very satisfying DVD on the shelf.  Any true collector of horror films that does NOT have this Hitchcock spine-tingler in his/her DVD collection should be "Psycho"-analyzed -- and then pointed in the direction of this Amazon webpage ASAP!  *wink*</p></body></html>

Then when you the power, you get the women. You wanna play rough?" And so on and so on. Whether you love "Scarface" or you love throwing fireworks at bee hives (after futile searches for wasp hives), we all know those beautiful unforgettable lines.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm not being fair when I call this the greatest gangster film ever made but hey, that's life. This contains truckloads of scenes that all have their way of sticking around in your brain, and then some filler material in which virtually nobody gets whacked. But the source of fuel of this is the brilliant Al Pacino who as few stars do, brings his lines like he's being paid millions of dollars for it.<br /><br />Al Pacino hunger and determination to make it to the top of the drug trade is strangely inspiring, in a society which regards him as scum of the earth. The longer the film rolls, the more crazy our Al becomes. But you find yourself drawn to his character wanting him to keep on getting bigger and bigger! The action is exciting and disturbing at times, which makes it all the more believable. The supporting casts are all good, and easily transport you into the Miami under world. Overall the film is full of unforgettable scenes, quotable one liners and a stellar performance from a living legend. A great film!!</p></body></html>

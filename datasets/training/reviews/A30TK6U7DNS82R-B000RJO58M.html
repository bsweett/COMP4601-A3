Anyway thank heavens for DVD where I could stop and pause and ask "What did he say?" without making too much of a ninny of myself.  Simon Pegg is twice as good here as he was in the zombie movie, and Nick Frost keeps up with him every step of the way.  (There's a cute DVD extra in which the two play up, and over the top, the homoerotics of the script--and the script, by inference, of all the buddy action movies the film is satirizing.)  Pegg is extraordinary in his affect, heck, I'd hire him for a real action adventure!  It's a strange movie in that it doesn't even have the merest hint of a romance for our hero (maybe that's why Danny, the constable played by Frost, gets so much of Pegg's amorous energy).<br /><br />Among the big (by British standards) names hired here to make supporting appearances, Jim Broadbent doesn't seem like they let him 100% into the joke, but Tim Dalton does his very best sly Alan Rickman as the manager of the local supermarket, Skinner, the man who becomes the leading suspect in a series of murders almost immediately.  It seems so obvious he had something to do with it, but if I were Timothy Dalton, would I bother cloaking my beauty with a the hooded cowl of a grim reaper?  That's how I knew it wasn't him!  It just wasn't making sense.  Billie Whitelaw, Samuel Beckett's favorite actress, has a blink and you'll miss her part, shame in a way because she can be very very funny and they might have given her more to do.  Martin Freeman, Bill Nighy, Steve Coogan, all play little bit parts rather the way that Bing Crosby shows up in ROBIN AND THE SEVEN HOODS, perhaps as a gesture of goodwill rather than actually contributing anything of substance.  It's the kind of movie you wind up watching twice or three times to catch the hundreds of zany verbal and visual cues and jokes you missed first time around.  The mystery plot isn't much, and Ira (STEPFORD WIVES) Levin, if he's still alive, is probably consulting with his plagiarism lawyers right now, but it's all in good fun and I hope the team continues for another round, next time I'll make it to the cinema opening night, instead of waiting for the DVD release.<br /><br />Oh, avoid those deleted scenes--yet again you see why editors make tthe big bucks and the writers, not so much.</p></body></html>

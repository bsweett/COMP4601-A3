However, after a four-year break, producer Jerry Bruckheimer decided to take the franchise in a new direction. Instead of continuing where the story left off at the end of "At Worlds End", Bruckheimer thought it would be best to start fresh with a new plot line.<br /><br />"On Stander Tides" is about Captain Jack Sparrow trying to find the fountain of youth. He is competing against his old foe Captain Barbossa and the Spanish to find it.<br /><br />With the new plot and characters, "On Stranger Tides" is better than "At Worlds End" but is nowhere near "The Curse of the Black Pearl".<br />If you are a fan of Captain Jack Sparrow, you will find this film entertaining as Johnny Depp does a great job as Captain Jack Sparrow.</p></body></html>

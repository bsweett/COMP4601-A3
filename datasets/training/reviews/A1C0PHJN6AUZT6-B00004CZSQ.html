The reviews and Bravo's reccommendations made me sure I would love this. I did not. The color and sets were amazing. The story and acting were not. There were many plot holes and things that didn't make sense. I understand why some people would like this, but there are many horror film buffs that find this out of place in cannon, and I 'm one of them.</p></body></html>

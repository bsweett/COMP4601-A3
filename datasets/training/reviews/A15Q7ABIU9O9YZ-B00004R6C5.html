<meta name="summary" content="Integrity is timeless"></head><body><p>I show this movie in its entirety to my business classes. I wheel it out when we deal with 'leadership' and the need to be willing to stand up for certain principles. We all won't be given the chance Attorney Atticus Finch is given to defend Tom Robinson 70 years after slavery ended in segregationist Alabama, but Gregory Peck in the defining role of his career points us in the right direction.<br /><br />That it is a 45 year old film doesn't really matter. The ideas are timeless. Atticus says to his son upon being asked why he took the Tom Robinson case, 'because I couldn't hold my head up if I said no.'<br /><br />Timeless stuff. Great family film. Pretty good for teenagers too if you can tie them down. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></body></html>

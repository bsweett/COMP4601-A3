It's hard to explain, but the film had a feel of not so much complimenting the original, but trying to one up itself as if to say `This is how it should have been done' fostered by the sense of someone taking the parts they thought worth saving, tweaking them (i.e. adding a lot more gore), and then making up the rest as they went along.  And that annoyed me a little as I thought the first film was an altogether relatively thoughtful little film with a good dose of originality and just a whole lot of fun...directed by stuntman turned director David R. Ellis (Cellular) and written by the team that also did The Butterfly Effect (2004), the film stars A.J. Cook as Kimberly Corman, a young woman with a strange gift (or curse, depending on your point of view).  Also appearing is Michael Landes (he played Jimmy Olsen in the television show Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman), Terrence 'T.C.' Carson (U-571), Lynda Boyd (Bones), and Jonathan Cherry (House of the Dead).  Reprising their roles from the first film are Ali Larter (Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) and Tony Todd, who also played the title role in the Candyman films.<br /><br />The story takes place about a year after the events that took place in the first film.  It turns out Kimberly (Cook), much like Devon Sawa's character of Alex from the original, is having premonitions about those around her, visions that foretell their impending demise which allows her to warn those doomed individuals allowing them to cheat death...but death doesn't give up, especially on those who escape its cold, bony grasp...in fact, those who manage to stay one step ahead with Kimberly's help invariably suffer an even worse fate than originally planned for them as death seems to hold a grudge against those who try to weasel out of their predetermined destinies.  Anyway, after saving a group of motorists from a fiery and twisted metal highway death, Kimberly tries to make sense out of what happened, but few are willing to believe her fantastic story and the relationship to the events of the past, specifically the freak accidents that killed nearly all the survivors of the flight 180 disaster a year ago...that is until they themselves begin getting picked off one by one in a series of events that would make Rube Goldberg proud.  This drives Kimberly to enlist the help of the one surviving member of the original group in that of Clear Rivers (Larter), who's currently a resident of the local mental institution, but that may not be enough as the Grim Reaper is a persistent, cunning little monkey who always gets the cheese...certainly aided a few times throughout the film by the compete stupidity of the intended victims (check out the character of Evan, the young man driving the Trans-Am...this Mensa candidate should have been drowned at birth).<br /><br />If I've learned anything from Final Destination 2 it's that if it's your time to go, then you should go...if you try to cheat death, it will still get you in the end, and when it does the mode of your death will be much gruesome and horrible than the way you were originally intended to die...and I also learned Apple Computers must have supplied some dough for the production of the film as their product placement appears numerous times (gee, strange how all the computers in the film are of the Apple variety...I don't mind product placement in a film, but next time make it a little less obvious so I don't get the complete sense of sleazy pandering as I did here).  Did I enjoy the film?  For the most part, yes, but I did make the mistake of expecting there to be a true, continuing development of the original storyline rather than a half-hearted rehashing featuring over the top death scenes lavished with gory effects...truly, it seemed like the death sequences were immaculately designed, and then the story created later to fill in the spaces between those scenes not leading up to another spectacular macabre fatality.  In terms of the actors, well, there weren't really any memorable performances as not long into the film you realize most of them are there in the capacity of gristle awaiting the grind.  I will say I thought the director did a good job leading us down the path towards certain events (including numerous false starts), as I did feel tension welling up prior to various characters getting their comeuppance (deservedly so or not) and he really kept the pacing of the film quick, resulting in a 90 minute run time, sort of like a pleasant enough acquaintance that doesn't overstay their welcome.  Also, the death sequences were creative and elaborate, almost more so than in the first, so if that's where your interest lies, you will not be disappointed.  This film also featured one of the most spectacular multi-car crash sequences in a film I've seen in a long time.  As far as the story the links to the original seemed tenuous at best, and became kind of convoluted with the emergence of some sort of `ripple effect' theory that didn't really stick too well especially since one could make the argument that every person on the planet can be linked together through their associations.  The comedic elements are given more weight here, probably due to the lack of meaningful relationships between characters as was seen in the original.<br /><br />New Line Home Entertainment gives this film their `Infinifilm' treatment, which means they pour on the extras.  The DVD features both the anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) along with the fullscreen version, and three, count them, three audio formats including English (DTS 6.1 ES), English (Dolby Digital 5.1 EX), English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo).  Extras include a fact track, music videos, deleted/alternate scenes, a commentary track by director David R. Ellis, producer Craig Perry, and screenwriters J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress, along with a couple of featurettes titled Cheating Death: Beyond and Back (18:10) and Bits and Pieces: Bringing Death Back to Life (14:00).  I think my favorite parts of the special features is when director Ellis talks about how much a role his assistant Tawny Ellis (notice they have the same last name?  Because she's his daughter) played in the creative process of the film, despite her general lack of experience.  Nepotism is certainly a fact of life, but I can't help but wonder if his regularly consulting with her on whether or not certain scenes work rubbed anyone (anyone not a part of the Ellis family) the wrong way.<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />One more thing...there is a Final Destination 3 in the works, scheduled for a 2006 release...</p></body></html>

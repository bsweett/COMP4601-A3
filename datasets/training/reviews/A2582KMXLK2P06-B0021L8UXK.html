<meta name="summary" content="this is pretty awesome"></head><body><p>The Crazies is just a really wonderfully created suspenseful flick dealing with a cop and his pregnant wife running around town avoiding a mysterious disease that turns people into mindless lunatics.<br /><br />Now I was never quite sure whether these diseased people were supposed to be zombies or just a horrible illness that turned regular people into psychotic killers.  I'm leaning towards zombies simply because I remember a few scenes that showed a certain strange look (a vicious green glow) deep inside their infected eyeballs.<br /><br />Anyway the Crazies really does a *tremendous* job building into a solid, storyline-focused film.  I'd even go so far as to put it on the same level of quality as 28 Days Later.  Watching a select few lucky people barely escaping with their lives time and time again manages to keep your attention VERY well.<br /><br />One thing I found a bit odd is that, when we reach the part when the military comes into the picture, they seemed completely heartless and didn't even care if they eliminated innocent diseased-free people.  Many times there wasn't even a DESIRE to see if the people were diseased or not- they just shot and fired and killed them.  To me that was just... really unnecessary and downright harsh.<br /><br />I assume the reason for this was because the miltary (and perhaps, the government) *could*.  After all, we're talking about a disease outbreak in a small, mid-western town apparently in the middle of nowhere.  "If you kill ALL the people, nobody will realize it -or rather, nobody will *care*- anyway).  Still, a LITTLE bit of compassion would have been nice.<br /><br />The violence is appealing, the suspense is seriously all OVER the place, the storytelling is memorable because it improves as it goes along, and... the Crazies is just a splendid film.</p></body></html>

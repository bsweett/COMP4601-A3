<meta name="summary" content="A Good Movie For Casual Viewers and Sandler Fans"></head><body><p>Not one of Sandler's best films, but it isn't horrible by any means. This is mainly drama, but it does have it's side jokes. Having never seen the original film, I can only judge it based on the movie alone and it is good, but not great. Everyone in the movie is really good, but the story wants to drag in scenes. But, there are some moments I thought were really funny. If you are a fan of Adam Sandler, give this a try, but if you are a fan of the original film...there is a good chance that this won't live up to it. Very few remakes ever do.</p></body></html>

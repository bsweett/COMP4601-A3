<meta name="summary" content="Good body-count flick"></head><body><p>"They kidnapped my daughter!" I can't remember how many action movies start that way, including flicks with Bruce Willis, Steven Segal, Chuck Norris, and just about anyone else you could name. It's one of the most heavily used jumping-off points for getting the story going. So, since the basic premise is so well worn, what really matters is where the movie jumps to.<br /><br />Neeson, with hair color not quite matching the lines in his face, does a great job as the wrong guy to mess with. He pounds his way through the seamy side of Paris with grim inexorability, from its grubby underbelly to the highest ranks of society and authority. As you might expect, the bodies of bad guys stack like cordwood. For all that violence, there's remarkably little visible bloodshed, but one or two moments seemed gratuitous. (Was that 'flesh wound' really necessary?)<br /><br />If you're looking for a macho fantasy of righteous wrath, carried out by an implacable and seemingly indestructible loner, you came to the right place. You'll have to suspend disbelief for a while, but this movie's suspense repays the effort.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters</p></body></html>

Whoever thought that lining up in a big mass in front of a group of musket-wielding automatons was a good idea, is a military leader without a hint of imagination.  Through the ardent desire to form a country free from oppression, a country is born, and its first heroes<br /><br />STORY:  Col. Benjamin Martin (Gibson) wishes to stay out of war and seek peace.  With a recently deceased wife he counters the growing surge to fight the Brits with this brilliantly prophetic line about having one's own government, "Why should I trade one tyrant three thousand miles away for three thousand tyrants one mile away? An elected legislature can trample a man's rights as easily as a king can."<br /><br />PATRIOTISM:  When his son Gabrielle (Ledger) enlists without his permission, Benjamin is heart-fallen and worried.  With just about everyone, however, enlisting is looked upon as brave, just, and patriotic.  As the wars rage in his own crops and on his land, his young family is unwillingly embroiled in a country's birth.  When his despotic middle child foolishly rushes into a gun-fight without a gun, Benjamin decides it's about time to unleash the fury within (the defense of one's country is closely tied to the security of a man's family).<br /><br />FAVORITE BATTLE(S): In the most memorable scene of the movie, Benjamin takes his two youngest sons - one may have still been carrying a pacifier - into the woods to hunt some Brits who had previously imprisoned Gabrielle and displayed their poor dental hygiene.  After setting up a rudimentary ambush and supplying the kids with a few words of wisdom, Benjamin almost single-handedly destroys a platoon of red-coats with a couple of muskets, a knife, an Indian axe, and the rage of a father who just saw his son get the business end of a musket.  Benjamin Martin really was some sort of combination of a ghost, a ninja, and great Indian MME warrior in this one.<br /><br />FAVORITE LINE:  Aim small, miss small.<br /><br />THE MESSAGE:  Taxes suck, without representation they suck worse, and there was no way England could control the willpower of America's people.</p></body></html>

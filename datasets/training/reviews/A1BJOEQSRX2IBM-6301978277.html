<meta name="summary" content="A Legendary Comedy, One of the Best Ever!"></head><body><p>Jack Lemmon and Tuny curtis are hilarious and perfect in their roles, Marilyn Monroe has her best role as the sexy Sugar Kane. Billy Wilder does it again, he created a legendary film and among the all-time best american  comedies. This movie is sensational from start to finish, it has perfect  timing by it's talented cast, great screenplay, direction by a  comic-genious and milestone comedy performances by Jack Lemmon and Tony  Curtis who have never been funnier. Famous for Joe E. Brown's closing line  'Nobody's Perfect' but this comedy is as close as they come. One of the  greats. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 10!</p></body></html>

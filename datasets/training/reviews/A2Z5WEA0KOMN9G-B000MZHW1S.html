I suppose that they are being used to fund those various brush wars in Africa.  I did like how they also brought up the topic of child soldiers.<br /><br />What I didn't like was how they seemed to blame the west for much of the strife in Africa.  We buy the diamonds.  We arm them (never mind the AK's).  Etc.  Yet at some point, don't they have to take responsibility for their future?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Movie is Better Than the Book"></head><body><p>I had listened to the book on tape when it first came out, so I was already familiar with the story.<br /><br />The book was very confusing to me, I found it hard to follow. But I think the film was made in such a way that it was less confusing. Such as when Tom Hanks is going over the code, the letters or words highlight themselves as he goes along. Or when he is thinking through a problem, there is an impression of it that appears before him. All this makes it easier to understand.<br /><br />As for the acting, I thought both Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou were good in their roles. But I think the stand-outs for acting in this movie are Paul Bettany and Alfred Molina. Bettany sure has a difficult role as the monk who is after Hank's character.<br /><br />Also, I consider myself Christian and the movie and book didn't bother me. It is just Fiction after all, or just one person's idea. I like the fact that the movie leaves you thinking about religion and the meaning behind it, and shows that the people in the film believe in their faith very deeply. There are many scenes that address Jesus' Divinity and Humanity, and I think that is a good thing thing to show a movie audience.<br /><br />So there are a lot of issues in this movie that will really make you think about Jesus and religion. And it is very much a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.</p></body></html>

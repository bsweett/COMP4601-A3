It is beautiful to look at since the animation is so imaginatively detailed.  I can see it would be a dream come true to a Preschooler obsessed with anything that sprouts wheels.  The Route 66 references were great and I hope this movie will help keep the "mother road" in the minds of  younger generations.  Having lived in Oklahoma I had to smile about  cow er I mean tractor tipping being so enthustiastically embraced by the small town residents.  The characterizations of vehicles living in "Radiator Springs" were clever but came from central casting.  The most original element of "Cars" is it's depiction of a wheels only universe with nary a human about.  In this vehicles only world even the bugs are tiny autos and the "planes" leave car tracks in the sky.</p></body></html>

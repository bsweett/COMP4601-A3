<meta name="summary" content="one of Cruise's best"></head><body><p>next to roles like Jerry Maguire and Ethan Hunt is Mission Immossible, theres Tom Cruise in Minority Report and this is really a great role for him and Steven Spielberg's direction and the characters and atmosphere pay off in this. obviously one of Spielberg's harshest. in the future crimes can be sceen before they ever happen and thats what Cruise and the rest of his team do, is put away the badguys, but something will happen to Cruise and he will have to run to save his own ass from being put away. Colin Farrell is along for the ride as the cop whos trying to catch Cruise but finds out something else as well. riveting, extrodinary and shocking. this one hits the bullseye</p></body></html>

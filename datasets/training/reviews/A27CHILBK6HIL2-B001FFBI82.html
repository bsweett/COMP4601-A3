<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant Cinematography As Expected, But The Film Is Uninteresting Due To Lack Of Character Development"></head><body><p>MOVIE: What if there was a movie that wasn't about war, but about the soldiers. Jarhead is exactly that, a film about the jarheads who went to war just to grab a gun and kill some Iraqis. That's pretty much what Jarhead is about. No battle, no gore, just guys finding themselves out in the desert. Unfortunetly the film lacks depth, it lacks substance. The audience doesn't grow with the characters, and there is nothing for the audience to work with. There is a scene in the beginning were Jake Gyllenhaal's character starts to narrate some events from his life. Then the camera moves out of the room and the door closes, and his character states that we the audience aren't allowed to see his past. Unfortunetly, by denying the audience the character's background, the characters appear static and then there is nothing to emotionally connect with. The only thing the film boasts is some amazing cinematography and decent acting, but they totally go to waste because of the the weak story. Almost everyone I know wanted to see Jarhead, and you can thank Universal for their brilliant (but deceptive) marketing campaign. The trailer was brilliantly put together while accompanied by "Jesus Walks" by Kanye West. What this did was appeal the movie to a wider audience. By having a rap song highlight your trailer you open to teens and the urban audience. The tv spots hit hard and fast with the song as well. I knew before I walked in what this movie was about, because I know Sam Mendes as a director and he doesn't do action. So, everyone had expectations for this gung ho war epic, and instead they got a character piece, and that's why alot of people were disssapointed. I was dissapointed because there was never a connection of the characters to the audience, and when there is an emotional distance from the audience to your characters that is never a good sign.<br /><br />ACTING: There is a lot of yelling in this movie, well, that's pretty much all there is. A bunch of young men sitting around in the desert just waiting to kill someone. Jake Gyllenhaal does a good job, not steller but good.  Jamie Foxx, who was advertised as a main selling point in the trailer, does an acceptable job too. The acting was acceptable, nothing more.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The cinematography is brilliant, then again we come to expect that from a Sam Mendes film. Unfortunetly, while the film may be pretty to look at it's not interesting to watch. The characters are underdeveloped, and the movie doesn't do much with them.</p></body></html>

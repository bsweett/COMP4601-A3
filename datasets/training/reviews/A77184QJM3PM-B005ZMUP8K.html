From a Hollywood dirty word, to a hot-hot-hot property, pirate films are "IT" now. I must admit I wasn't too sure about this film. I loved the first film, "The Curse of the Black Pearl", but I knew it was a stand-alone piece, while the next two films in the series were meant as a two-parter. Meaning, of course, that there would be no real ending to the second film, only a lead-in to the third. That said, I enjoyed this film. There is a noticeably darker tone right off the bat, which never lets up, even in the lighter moments. From the ruined wedding to the cannibalistic natives to the evil Davey Jones himself, not to mention the darker side shown to miss Elizabeth Swann and the fall from grace of Commodore Norrington. True, the critcs were not kind to the movie, and yes the plot does meander all over. Again, the film is saved by the performance of Johnny Depp as CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow. One watches and really wonders if he is really that bad, or is he hiding a heart of tainted gold under all those swaggers and innuendoes? Whatever the case, Johnny Depp is mesmerizing in the role. You simply can't take your eyes off him. Kiera Knightley and Orlando Bloom give more rounded performances this time around, and Jack Davenport is much more intrigueing this time around as Norrington on the fast track downward. The films effects are top-notch, almost overwhelming. At times, it seemed that the director just thought of something else to pop in and wrote a scene for it. There are some excessive scenes, but also some tender ones as well. The scenes between Will Turner and his father, Boot Strap, are well done. All in all, this movie isn't as well-conceived as the first one, but it is entertaining, and does get you ready for the third film, the series finale. Certainly, the surprise at the end caught me off-guard, and has me ready for the wrap-up! Yo-Ho-HO!</p></body></html>

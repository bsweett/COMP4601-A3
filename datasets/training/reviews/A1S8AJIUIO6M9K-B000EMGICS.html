<meta name="summary" content="All the pieces are perfect, including the annoying ones"></head><body><p>I saw a small bit of this on TV where Jennifer Aniston and Kevin Costner shined, and ordered it on a whim to see the rest.<br /><br />I cannot understand all the low ratings.  There are certainly parts of the movie that are trite and annoying, but that is real life and the movie should get extra credit for reminding you of your crazy annoying relatives, not be penalized.<br /><br />A clear sequel to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000F798">The Graduate (40th Anniversary Collector's Edition)</a>, one which could have been called "The Graduate: Next Generation," the story line, the script, the world-class actors in low-key supporting roles, the settings, all of this makes this a very fine "background movie" (what I screen when doing tedious but necessary things like printing address labels) and I loved it.<br /><br />I would definitely be interested in Graduate Part IV, where she gets divorced, comes back to Costner, and they live a life of sheer joy--<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0099297701">Hannibal</a> (book version vice <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXSP">Hannibal (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> DVD version).</p></body></html>

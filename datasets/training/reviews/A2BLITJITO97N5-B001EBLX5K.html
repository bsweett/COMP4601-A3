That something could be a pentecostal meeting, a rodeo, a business meeting in a hotel, etc. It really doesn't matter. Just find an event that requires a great deal of planning to pull off in an organized and efficient manner and rush in and be very obnoxious or offensive. Film the reactions, edit it, and you have a movie. The question for the viewer is whether it is a movie worth watching. I didn't think so. There is no wit involved here. You either think it is hilarious to mock a Christian religious service or you don't (I would like to see Cohen do the same to an Islamic religious meeting. That might be the end of his career and more.). What is funny about going into an antique shop and breaking dishes? Some of the people he makes fun of seem genuinely nice. Mocking them or causing them distress was not amusing. One star. Next time, get a few jokes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the Greatest American fillms ever made"></head><body><p>Russell Crowe may be the Marlon Brando of the 21st century after 5 years of great films, his greatest is stil Gladiator and now his second greatest is Ron Howard's uplifting masterpiece "Cinderella Man" this good hearted biographical story of depression era boxer Jim Braddock, who brought hope to those in the great depression. a shining and starlighting triumph that is Ron Howard's greatest film,  and by the magic of Ron Howard I can't believe my eyes and ears that not many people went to go see this beautiful picture, it did come out at the wrong time. It's still wonderess to behold, a real fairy tale hence the title "Cinderella Man" one of Hollywood's greatest motion pictures. Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger and Paul Giamatti are marvelous. See this entertainment gem before the oscars. Jake La Motta and Rocky Balboa are knocked out by this knockout king of a movie.</p></body></html>

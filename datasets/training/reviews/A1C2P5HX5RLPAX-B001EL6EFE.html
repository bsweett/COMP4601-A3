<meta name="summary" content="Fun"></head><body><p>This is the story of four friends, best friends who just happen to be animals. Alex the Lion who's spoiled with grooming and precut steaks; Marty the Zebra who loves his life but yearns for some more, Melman the hypochondriac Giraffe and Gloria the Hippo who acts as a surrogate mother to the other three. From the beginning we see how spoiled these friends are with their every whim filled by their caretakers.<br /><br />They end up packed in crates bound for a African preserve after Marty decides he wants to see "the wild" and goes out wandering in the streets of New York. This probably wouldn't have been so bad were it not for his friends deciding to go save him. Lions roaming the streets are a little more serious than Zebras. I didn't appreciate the humour of the NY cop asking his boss if he could shoot the Zebra. Because of unforeseen circumstances they end up severed from the ship, floating in the ocean and finally landing on a tropical paradise.<br /><br />Like any movie there are scene stealers. In this case, it's the four military trained penguins that also have their own Christmas short in the features area. Another scene stealer is an itty bitty lemur named Mort who has Puss-in-boot eyes and a nervous giggle.<br /><br />Obviously not true to life;  the gates are low so the animals can get to one another or at the crowds but then it's not every day you can hear a Zebra, Lion, Giraffe and Hippo talk, dance and sing. Great fun for kids but if the adults are looking for fun they'll only be mildly amused. As always the graphics are great, the music is toe tapping and there is humour. There are a few minute frightening scenes when the animals realize they are not in a Zoo anymore and cute cuddly little beings are being eaten by bigger not so cute ones but this is really short. There are a few other sad/dark points but overall it is a fun movie.</p></body></html>

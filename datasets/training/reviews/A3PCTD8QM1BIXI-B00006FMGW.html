Even though I liked Gangs Of New York more, Leo gives another great as Frank W. Abagnale Jr a teenage con men who is full of heart. Tom Hanks as arch enemy Carl Hanratty also gives a heart felt performance. The film is full of comedy and drama and is for the young and the young at heart.</p></body></html>

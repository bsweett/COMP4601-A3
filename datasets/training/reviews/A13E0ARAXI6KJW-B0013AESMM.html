<meta name="summary" content="Jordan and a Ferocious Foster Teeter Between Adrenaline-Pumping Vigilante Thrills and a More Thoughtful Examination"></head><body><p>For what really amounts to a standard revenge thriller, this 2007 movie has quite a pedigree with director Neil Jordan (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006FO9BK">The Crying Game</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHRVOM">Breakfast on Pluto</a>) at the helm and Jodie Foster as the star. Together, they provide greater texture and moral ambiguity than what one would expect from a formulaic, overly contrived script by the father-and-son screenwriting duo of Roderick and Bruce A. Taylor, and Cynthia Mort. Foster, in particular, seems to be channeling her most famous roles into a greatest hits package here, as I can see aspects of her enraged rape survivor in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005Y1UT">The Accused</a>, her tenacious FBI agent in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LP6KNU">The Silence of the Lambs</a>, and her victimized pre-teen prostitute in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R8YC18">Taxi Driver</a>. In fact, the film evokes the unsettling urban paranoia of Martin Scorsese's 1976 classic as much as it does the audience-pleasing vigilantism of 1973's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000541AN">Death Wish</a>, the movie with which it is most frequently compared in professional reviews.<br /><br />With a low-key manner that appears to boil just underneath the surface, Foster plays Erica Bain, a public radio personality whose descriptive observations take inspiration from living in New York City, which she acknowledges is a safer place but profoundly changed since 9/11. At the outset, Erica is in an idyllic relationship with a younger doctor and preparing for her wedding. As she and her fianc&eacute; walk their dog through Central Park at dusk, a group of thugs abuse and attack them and one actually films their brutal act. Erica survives the attack, but unrelenting grief over her dead fianc&eacute; leads to a consuming fear. Unable to move past the tragedy and growing impatient with the police to find the men responsible, she illegally buys a 9mm handgun to protect herself. Witnessing a crime in a convenience store, Erica confronts her fear head on and finds herself on the offensive with an inability to connect with her old self.<br /><br />It's at this stage of the film that Jordan treads precariously between an intriguing examination of the corrupting power of violence and a series of visceral thrills that has Erica feeling bracingly liberated by her actions. The latter finally overtakes the film with the script's overly coincidental plot turns leading to a questionable ending. Complicating Erica's monomaniacal path to her fianc&eacute;'s killers is Sean Mercer, a cynical, emotionally damaged detective who gets drawn to her fate both professionally and personally. Terrence Howard is solid as Mercer, but the contrived, purposefully ambiguous nature of his character undermines his credibility. It also feels like the relationship between Mercer and Erica has been left vague more out of plot convenience than thoughtful consideration of the increasingly tense circumstances. Regardless, it's Foster who makes all the melodrama watchable, even though the familiarity of her steely determination is starting to feel like retread.<br /><br />Smaller roles are not as well fleshed out, though the actors shine briefly - Mary Steenburgen as Erica's plainspoken boss; Naveen Andrews as the unlucky fianc&eacute;; Nicky Katt relentlessly annoying as Mercer's wisecracking sidekick; and in what amounts to a convenient plot device, Nigerian actress Ene Oloja as Erica's unperturbed neighbor. If Z&ouml;e Kravitz looks familiar as the drugged runaway Chloe, that's because she's the daughter of Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet. Special mention should be given to Philippe Rousselot's cinematography which vividly matches the off-kilter urban landscape with Erica's unstable situation. The 2008 DVD is sparse on extras with no running commentary provided by either Jordan or Foster, who also served as one of the producers. There is a twenty-minute making-of featurette, "I Walk the City", in which Jordan, the producers, the screenwriters and the stars are interviewed. As usual, Foster comes across as the most articulate and insightful. In addition, there are five deleted scenes, all understandably excised from the final cut.</p></body></html>

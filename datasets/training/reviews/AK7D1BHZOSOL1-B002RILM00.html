To compare this in any way to the classic movie of 1973 is an insult and to call this film a remake is an insult to all halfway decent remakes.  This is the only movie Cage stars in that I have to go with the majority and say that he is not a good actor.  Most of the time with Cage movies even if the story isn't very good he is at least passionate about the role.<br /><br />That just never arrives here.  This doesn't even make it into the "so bad its good" category it is just bad.</p></body></html>

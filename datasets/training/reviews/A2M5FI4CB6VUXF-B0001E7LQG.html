<meta name="summary" content="Some ONE's got to give...."></head><body><p>And the "someones" are Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, who give wonderfully sweet and sassy performances in this story about Destiny almost thwarted.<br /><br />Jack plays a quitessential playboy. It seems he has a new girlfriend every week. Only this time perhaps he's found "the one" in Amanda Peet. Enter Diane Keaton, Peet's mother. A successful playwrite, she is hardly looking for romance. Comfortable in her static, routine existence, surrounded by her characters, living her life vicariously through them at times, Keaton seems blissfully unaware of her own appeal. (Typical to any Keaton character, which is likely part of her basic charm.)<br /><br />Keaton and Nicholson have a battle of wits, a battle of charms and an ultimate battle of hearts (notwithstanding Nicholson's heart attack about mid movie.)<br /><br />In the closing minutes, the question is looming... will they or won't they? And I won't spoil it... you'll have to watch it to find out.<br /><br />but I will say this... the movie is satisfying in its conclusion and is remarkable throughout. I LOVED it!</p></body></html>

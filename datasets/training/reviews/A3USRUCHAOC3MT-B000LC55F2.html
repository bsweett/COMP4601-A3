<meta name="summary" content="What You Get When You Cross "Batman Begins" With "The Sting""></head><body><p>This is definitely a well-done movie that keeps you thinking after you've watched it.<br /><br />The setting dealing with turn-of-the-century illusionists lead to the inevitable comparison between this and "The Illusionist." Aside from that, it's like comparing apples with oranges, Moby Dick with Jaws, fruit salad with a hot fudge sundae. These two movies have two different purposes and two different world views. Both succeeded equally well at what they aimed at accomplishing.<br /><br />I recently read "Saving Leonardo" by Nancy Pearcey, where she follows two differing philosophical trends: the Enlightenment tradition and the Romanitic tradition. The Prestige fits clearly into the Enlightenment setting. There is a rational explanation for everything.<br /><br />The philosophy also reveals itself in the story telling. There is no clear cut hero or villain here. Both main characters have elements that draw your interest and sympathy and both have character flaws that most would disapprove of.<br /><br />The reality is that the illusionist trade is the backdrop for the movie. Nolan is conveying a message that our senses deceive us, both in the setting with the illusionists and the view that people aren't always what they appear to be either.<br /><br />I personally consider this to be both more realistic than "The Illusionist" and a better made movie. That said, I enjoyed "The Illusionist" more than this movie.</p></body></html>

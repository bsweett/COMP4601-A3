<meta name="summary" content="A New Best In The Superhero Genre!"></head><body><p>MOVIE: Once the opening credits begin so does a brilliant montage of the first movie done in the style of a comic book. Basically they used the opening credits as a backdrop to put in a prologue. What makes this superhero movie stand out from those before it is that it has an enormous amount of character development. What makes this different from Batman, Superman, and the upcoming Catwoman is that it's not all about the action. Sure the movie has outstanding CGI's and a train fight that rivals the trailer truck fight in Matrix Reloaded, but there is so much emotion put out through the characters. With Batman all the movie is about is kicking ass. The reason why Spider-Man is such a successful movie is that Tobey Maguire has created such a character in Peter Parker that it allows the audience to really relate to him. We aren't superheros but sometimes it feels like we need to be in order to accomplish some things in life. Also Peter Parker is a genuine character, a &quot;same as you and me&quot; type of guy. Batman's parents were murdered, Daredevil's father was murdered, but Spider-Man really has no dark past except for the murder of his Uncle. Okay maybe murders in the family do drive people to become superheros but Spider-Man is not some guy dressed in black trying to silence the pain of his past, he's just your friendly neigberhood kind of guy. What the movie lacks is some new stuff. If you think about it, it's just a deeper version of the first one. Basically the same of Parker dealing with his conflicting lives. One other thing that bothered me was all the science mumbo jumbo the filled the movie with. I kind of laughed at how Octavius described how he met his wife when she was studying English Literature and he was studying Science. Please! Overall though a new best for the genre. It's a croud pleaser with a little more depth that just an action fare.<br /><br /> ACTING: You have to give it to the cast because without the cast they've got they would be nowhere. Alfred Molina steals the show as Dr. Octavius, his menacing Doc Ock just worked out so well. Tobey is Spider-Man, in and out, and Kirsten Dunst plays the lovely MJ Watson. Great casts make great movies.<br /><br /> BOTTOM LINE: Some parts of the movie could have been changed for the better, but overall this was one great superhero movie. I really think the new Batman will be a flop because Spider-Man has not only raised the bar, Spider-Man removed the bar and has become the bar.</p></body></html>

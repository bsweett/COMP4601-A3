<meta name="summary" content="Bunker mentality"></head><body><p>"Downfall" has received some criticism here and elsewhere for "humanizing Hitler."  In that regard, I think that the movie "Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary" ought to be a prerequisite for seeing "Downfall."  In that film, we hear Hitler's young secretary, Traudl Junge, discuss Hitler as a gentle, caring father figure.  She's so close in, she has limited visibility of the scope of the insanity and destruction this man has sown throughout the world.  And, since much of "Downfall" is from Ms. Junge's eyes and her "Blind Spot" position, this is the Hitler we get.<br /><br />Acting-wise, "Downfall" is a tour-de-force from Swiss actor Bruno Ganz  (a favorite of mine from an all-time favorite movie, "Bread and Tulips").  He plays Hitler as a claustrophic, deranged, literally shrunken, shell of a man beset with the very definition of "bunker mentality."  There's also some riveting acting from the actors playing Speer, Goebbels and Himmler.<br /><br />One can only imagine the impact "Downfall" had in Germany.  As one reviewer here aptly puts it, this is a "German movie for Germans."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Too Much Of Anything Is Not Good For You, Babe."  Barry White"></head><body><p>When popular philosopher Barry White shared these immortal words with America, he might easily have been working from the Roald Dahl playbook.  Charlie And The Chocolate Factory is an oddly moralistic tale about the hazards of excess, not just of sweets, but parental indulgence, competitiveness, and aggression.  The question is, why remake it?  Fortunately, there are many valid reasons.<br /><br />While Gene Wilder has given us many wonderful performances, his rendition was too drenched in saccharine musical theatre numbers to satisfy and now looks dated.  Tim Burton, by contrast, brings not only his reliably astonishing visual imagination to the party, but also a bittersweet sensibility perfectly in keeping with Dahl's perspective.  Lucky for us he also brings frequent co-conspirator Johnny Depp, and musical wiz Danny Elfman.  In addition to being one of our very best actors, Depp is most drawn to roles that offer interesting challenges.  His Willy Wonka, in addition to being a sartorial splendor, is part perpetual child, part mad scientist, part eccentric gazillionaire, and part absent-minded professor.  That he allows justice to work itself out in his presence is more a matter of absent-mindedness than malevolence.  Indeed, the faults of the children involved - and their parents - appear to provide their own lessons and punishments with little help from Willy.<br /><br />From black and gray cityscapes reminiscent of Batman to color so dazzling you might request a pair of Charlie's oversize sunglasses, this film gives your eyes a workout they will never forget - simply spectacular.  Special recognition must be given to Deep Roy who, through the miracle of digital technology, plays all of the innumerable Oompa Loompas.  With almost no lines he manages to improve every scene he's in, and the musical numbers, which draw from Busby Berkeley to Saturday Night Fever and all points in between, are simply fantastic.  (Elfman really came through on these, they have a hip, ironic sensibility thoroughly lacking in the Wilder version.)<br /><br />That Helena Bonham Carter was willing to lend her name to the project when she has little to do but chop cabbage tells you a great deal about the quality level.  Finally, Charlie Bucket, played winningly by Freddie Highmore, is every bit as ingratiating and unassuming as we would like him to be, he deserves his good fortune.  (After seeing the headgear Willy had to wear as a child, you will agree that he deserves a break too.)  Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have done it again, a wonderful movie worth owning and watching many times.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="3.5 stars--Visually stunning"></head><body><p>The look of this movie is like nothing I have ever seen, the pages of a comic book come to life on the screen. That alone is an amazing achievement and I wish I ended up liking the movie more than I did.<br /><br />There are 3 different stories told here, all taking place in the title location of Sin City. Mickey Roarke plays a low life trying to avenge the murder of a prostitute who showed him kindness. The second story has Clive Owen, a murderer, seeking revenge on Benicio Del Toro, a low-life cop, on behalf of his new girlfriend. The last tale is an odd love story between old washed-up cop Bruce Willis and the girl he saves from a psycho when she is 11.<br /><br />The cast is wonderful on paper, but not all of them give good performances. Some of the dialog and voice-over narration is very well done and some is laughably bad. The film overall is too long and drags after awhile. There is a lot of violence and blood which I have no problem with, except that it was overdone. There comes a point when it doesn't mean anything anymore.<br /><br />This movie affected me somewhat, but not completely. It is darkly beautiful to look at, even through all the blood.</p></body></html>

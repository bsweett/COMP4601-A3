In addition to having some great pre-CGI effects, the witty and delightful Bruce Campbell and some ingenious creative moments, ARMY OF DARKNESS nicely pays homage to some great classic novels and/or movies.  We get "Gulliver's Travels"; "The Thing with Two Heads"; and of course, a tribute to Ray Harryhausen's ingenious skeletons in "7th Voyage of Sinbad" and "Jason and the Argonauts."  There is kind homage also to the Three Stooges in some of the slapstick tomfoolery that occurs.  The scene of the skeletons marching into the castle with skeleton head drums; bagpipes and trumpets is priceless.  Raimi earned his credentials on these three films, enabling him to go on to higher class films and of course the superb SPIDERMAN series.  Gorgeously filmed and lit, ARMY OF DARKNESS is a marvelous movie; the theatrical ending is much more enjoyable that the Planet of the Apes one.  Enjoy.  I did!!!</p></body></html>

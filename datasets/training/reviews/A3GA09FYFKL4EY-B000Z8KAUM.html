They give a token honor among thieves warning to Bank (Al Pacino) to play fair, knowing they'll have to wreak havoc by "breaking The Bank." What follows is mayhem in the fine tradition of "Ocean's 11" and an infinitely better romp than the abysmal "Ocean's 12." Everyone is back together - and even with old enemy Terry Benedict.<br /><br />The harm done to the hotel critic isn't funny, but that's the only low point, and I missed Julia Roberts.  Everything else is great, fiendishly clever, and a disappointment that this is the last in the trilogy. Well worth it to buy the DVD.</p></body></html>

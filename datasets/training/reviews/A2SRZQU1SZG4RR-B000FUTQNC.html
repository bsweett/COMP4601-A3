<meta name="summary" content="Nearly Perfect Transfer of  Millions of $ to Cayman Islands"></head><body><p>Harrison Ford, plays Jack Stanfield, a bank executive, and developer of the most current software for Pacific Landrock Bank. The bank is due to merge with a huge conglomerate purportedly to enhance business and increase assets. Jack has conservative views regarding risk-taking and protecting the assets of customers. This strong stance stood him well for 20 years but places him in a dimlight with the new owners at the board meeting who are willing to risk the money of customers for future earnings. He is introduced to several high level entrepeneurs and associates believed to be associated with the new firm. The meeting is occuring right about when the banking network is being attacked by computer hackers who invaded Jack's home and are holding his family hostage.<br /><br />The unexpected break in to Jack's house begins the tension that keeps mounting as more details are revealed regarding the reason for the kidnapping. Jack's wife, daughter and young son are threatened with physical harm ... the team of five stop at nothing to get what they want. Jack understands the seriousness of their threats when Bill Cox the leader, shoots one of his own men in the head after he failed to follow directions and nearly foiled their plans. He proved his point: Jack agreed to do what they wanted -- break into his bank's software, override the firewall, and transfer money to an account in the Cayman Islands. His wife and children nearly manage an escape before they are caught and sent back into confinement. Bill Cox punishes Jack by letting Jack's son almost die of an allergic reaction to peanuts ... The family realizes, they know too much to be allowed to live if Bill Cox and his team manage the money transfer ...<br /><br />Jack desperately goes along with all the plans by moving money and changing information on the banks software -  while plotting to overthrow Bill COx and his team. Harrison Ford plays a gutsy, tough, family man who fights with everything he has to save his family, to keep them alive. This film is filled with edge-of-your seat moments. It has a well developed plot, great actors, and a very satisfactory ending. At times, the scenes can be gruesome but the acting is superb and required for the theme. Anyone who loves to see Harrison Ford at his utmost best ... should see this film. He is one of the few great leading actors of modern times. This is a serious film, with lots of fighting and frightening moments therefore not for the faint of heart.<br />Erika Borsos (erikab93)</p></body></html>

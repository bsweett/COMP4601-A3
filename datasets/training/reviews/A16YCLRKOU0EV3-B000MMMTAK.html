This movie is very funny, if you have an open, unpolitically correct mind. The comedy in this movie, much like the comedy in South Park in my opinion, is in the style of All in the Family. The dvd box and the disc itself, as well as the on-screen menus and bonus materials are some of the most original, well thought-out designs I have ever seen.</p></body></html>

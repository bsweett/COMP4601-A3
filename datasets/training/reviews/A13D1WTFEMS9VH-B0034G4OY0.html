The filmmaker knows that some -- perhaps many -- will reject it out of hand, for various reasons, e.g., such a subject is not "scientific", or, conversely, how it is presented does not comport with one's deeply held religious beliefs. Mr. Eastwood deftly navigates these waters to deliver a very satisfying and thought provoking story. By raising the possibility of an afterlife through the experiences of otherwise intelligent, clear-headed people, we are confronted with a dilemma: Are these people all delusional? Or is what they have experienced real and therefore worthy of our attention? We are never clubbed over the head with any particular belief system; rather, we are instead left to ponder the question and the profound implications. Of course, Mr. Eastwood also shows us that money-grubbing charlatans, who use the desperate need of the grieving to connect with lost loved ones, abound. But the character played by Matt Damon (a reluctant "channeler" of the spirits of the dead) is the counterbalance to them. Having Mr. Damon struggle with his gift/curse is an interesting story in itself, and how this struggle plays out in the lives of the other characters is very moving. All in all, this is a unique and fascinating film.</p></body></html>

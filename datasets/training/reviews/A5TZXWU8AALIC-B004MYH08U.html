<meta name="summary" content="Reaffirming My Faith in Mankind"></head><body><p>I have to say that all of the one-star reviews destroying the abomination that is THE GREEN HORNET has reaffirmed my faith in mankind...or at least the American movie-going public.<br /><br />I will admit I was a little skeptical when Michael Keaton played BATMAN in 1989, but that movie was a pleasant surprise.  No masterpiece, mind you, but Tim Burton's funky visuals and Jack Nicholson's daffy and sinister Joker made it worth seeing.<br /><br />But Seth Rogen as a superhero?  Come on!  He has all the charisma and star quality as the Grape Ape cartoon.  And which genius thought it would be a good idea to let Rogen help write this monstrosity?  His schtick was getting old in teen stoner movies!<br /><br />But reading all the reviews of people WHO LIKE SUPERHERO MOVIES who couldn't even finish THE GREEN HORNET has made me proud of my country again, like after 9-11.<br /><br />(I love how the recent commercials pushing the DVD release feature Rogen in only one shot.  Kato gets about three or four.  I think the car gets more.  That, ladies & gentlemen of the jury, is my last exhibit for this stinkbomb).</p></body></html>

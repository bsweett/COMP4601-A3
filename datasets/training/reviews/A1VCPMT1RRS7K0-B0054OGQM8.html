Back to the Future was an incredibly successful trilogy of films running from the mid-80s into the early 90s.  The casting was amazingly solid and truly made the films stand out, along with special effects that were cutting-edge for the time.<br /><br />Christopher Lloyd is simply outstanding as the the nutty scientist, Crispin Glover perfectly portrays Marty's nerdy father and Lea Thompson is an interestingly provocative character as Marty's mother.  Michael J. Fox was a huge TV star when Part I was released - yet his fame made quite a quantam leap due to Part I and the subsequent movie franchise.<br /><br />The creativity that went into production is apparent in all three of the films.  They're each entertaining in their own ways.  Part I is definitely the most popular of the three.  Part II received mixed reviews and Part III was more like the first, but not quite as well received.  They're all worth seeing and they're all great movies.<br /><br />There is some debate over the formatting of the DVD versions of the film.  I don't see how it makes all that much difference, to be honest.  I watched all three films and enjoyed them, regardless of whether or not an inch of digital information was missing from the top or bottom of the screen.  The movies are wonderful, the bonus footage is extensive- loaded with "making of" footage, many deleted scenes, outtakes, etc, etc...<br /><br />If you enjoyed any of the three films, it is worth purchasing the Complete Trilogy, as the price is less than most single-feature DVDs on the market right now.  Great movies that make for great entertainment.  Highly recommended DVD set.</p></body></html>

Some people understand that the film has some remarkable technical innovations, yet still find the film less than compelling.  I can't really explain this reaction to the film, but it exists.  Perhaps if we understood why someone doesn't like Citizen Kane we would also unravel other great film mysteries such as  who would pay full price to see Tom Greene in something like Freddy Got Fingered and who can't wait to see Bio Dome 2.<p>Not everyone is going to agree it is the greatest film ever made or the most entertaining and once you start calling anything The Greatest of them all a bit of skeptism is likely to rear its head.  One thing is certain, most will appreciate Greg Toland's beautiful use of light and shadow and photographic genius.  And the more you know about how innovative some of the shots were and what lengths it took to accomplish them, you'll appreciate the effort even more. <p>The life of the fictional Charles Foster Kane is examined in detail.  It all starts with a quest to find out the significance of the last word kane uttered as he died -- Rosebud.  And all of the film techniques used in the film still seem fresh, the symbolism all works perfectly. In fact the film is constructed not unlike some massive reality television specials that might be called... The Unauthorized Biography of Charles Foster Kane. Of course it would be those reality television specials that are poorly mimicking some of the ideas and structures of Citizen Kane and not the other way around.  In other words we're talking about a film that can enjoyed as entertainment, not something that one only appreciates without feeling an affection or warmth toward it.  You can praise the film until you are sick of praising it and still find something in the film, a shot, a camera angle, a dissolve,  an actor's look, a line of dialogue, that will take your breath away.  <p>Except for the barest hint of edge enhancement this is the cleanest, crispest and most beautiful black and white film you've ever seen on DVD.  And it doesn't look overly processed or mechanical.  In fact there are some dark scenes where for the first time I was able to see some details I've never seen before. <p>The audio is Dolby Digital 1.0.  Rather than artificially enhance and try to remix the soundtrack it was merely cleaned up and presented as clean and crisp as possible.  It might have been nice to have heard a stereo version of Bernard Herrman's magnificent score, but it would seem utterly un-natural to long time fans of the film to have an artificially enhanced stereo surround soundtrack (and the elements probably don't exist to do it anyway).<p>There's a lot of extras on the DVD's from newsreel clips to secret Easter Eggs to find and enjoy.<p>There is a generous selection of stills which are automated but can be paused if desired. One of the still galleries contains additional commentary from Roger Ebert.<p>THE POST PRODUCTION section has four subsections including Deleted Scenes which offers photos, sketches and storyboards that show scenes which did not make the final cut of the film or were abandoned even before they were shot.  <p>If you highlight the sled on the features menu you will see the 5 minute interview with Ruth Warrick who played Emily Norton Kane. She talks about working with Welles and how the film was shot under strict security so no one would know exactly what was being shot or how it was all going to be put together when it was finished.  <p>Click on the sled on the last page of the second section of the production notes for a brief 3 minute interview with director Robert Wise. Wise was the editor on Citizen Kane and he tells the story about meeting Welles for the first and one of the first screenings of the film for very nervous executives and lawyers.<p>On Disc 2  you will find the full length documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane which was originally aired on P.B.S.'s American Experience Program.  <p>It tells the backgrounds of both William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles.  How their paths crossed, how the two men clashed and how Hearst became obsessed with stopping Kane and destroying Welles' career.  Kane bombed at the box-office but was then nominated for 9 Oscars, however it won only one and afterwards RKO withdrew the film from the market and put it in it's vault for several years.  Hearst's campaign to ruin the film and Welles was pretty effective but he also hurt his own career and reputation in the process.  <p>The first of two feature length commentary tracks is from director Peter Bogdanovich.  Bogdanovich's comments range from discussing the film's technical achievements and analyzing the storyline to recounting conversations he had with Welles about the film.  We learn Kane is not his favorite Welles film.<p>Roger Ebert's feature length commentary is even more interesting, informative.If you are not quite sure why the film is so highly regarded this commentary will clear it up for you. Ebert spends a lot of time talking about the innovative cinematography (deep focus photography), editing, the special optical effects used to create the imagery in the film and the lighting.  He goes into some detail about the symbolism used throughout the film and how the film was actually very low budget.  <p>Citizen Kane is a masterpiece and this DVD celebrates that by showing off the film at it's very best.  The extra's allow those who have not read several books, or seen documentaries about the film or Hearst and Welles to 'catch-up' with critics and film-buffs. <p>Christopher Jarmick,is the author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F. Holder a critically acclaimed, steamy suspense thriller.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="OUR INTREPID SURVIVORS ARE OBVIOUSLY IN FOR A LONG NIGHT!"></head><body><p>IN A NUTSHELL:<br /><br />This is a grab-you-by-the-seat-of-your-pants action thriller that starts with a bang and maintains its tension. Using a variety of clever devices throughout the film including a good script and fine acting, "Pitch Black" rises well above the usual genre fare.<br /><br />JUST PLAIN SCARY:<br /><br />All throughout "Pitch Black" there was a pervasive feeling that something ominously malevolent was getting closer to happening. We see signs from the beginning. Right after the crash landing we see distant trees that turn out to be the huge skeketal remains of a herd of huge animals. Then there's "something" that's scurrying about underground and a deserted camp without explanation. What happened to the people?<br /><br />BUT THAT'S NOT ALL:<br /><br />There was a model of the solar system with its 3 suns that demonstrated a total eclipse that was just about to occur! As all this is happening the pace picks up, it starts to get dark, their solar-powered vehicle stops working, and the whatevers that were scurrying around underground are beginning to pour out of the hilltops in mass. They resemble swarms of giant bats that look alot like the creatures in "Alien". Our intrepid survivors are obviously in for a long night!<br /><br />WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:<br /><br />That's what the film is all about. Suffice it to say that the pace swells to fever pitch in an environment where nobody is safe and there is no telling how long this "Pitch Black" environment will last. You'll find yourself on pins and needles for most of the film.<br /><br />Check it out!<br /><br />ALSO CONSIDER SEEING:<br /><br />Tremors, Alien, or Aliens.</p></body></html>

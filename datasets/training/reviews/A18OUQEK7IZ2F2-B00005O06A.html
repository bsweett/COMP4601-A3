It's a challenge to stay unbiased. Almost like when a trial has to be moved because all the potential jurors have already been influenced. Citizen Kane certainly falls in this camp. After all, it is perennially ranked #1 (AFI, Sight & Sound, etc.) and thus there is an *expectation* that it will be one of the best.<br /><br />It might well be other people's favorite film, but I cannot say the same. It was very good, and I will surely watch it again (I've already watched it twice on this nice new DVD). But I can think of several movies I like better, including Casablanca which came out a year later.<br /><br />Funny enough, I see more of a parallel between Charles Foster Kane and Orson Welles (later in life) than I do between Kane and William Randolph Hearst. In the end I think the film is a technical masterpiece and kudos to Welles, who of course also directed and produced. But in my opinion, he was better in Touch of Evil (1958).<br /><br />I think honestly this is a three-and-a-half star movie and I should probably round up because of all the great extras on this release.</p></body></html>

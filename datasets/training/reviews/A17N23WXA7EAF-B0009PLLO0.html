<meta name="summary" content="More Gay than Gladiator and Troy (and Troy was pretty gay)"></head><body><p>"Alexander" is more of a gay film than either or its predecessors "Gladiator" or "Troy". In "Gladiator" the homosexual themes are largely sublimated in costumes and melodrama. In "Troy" the homosexuality is more openly displayed but never rises past the point of visual symbolism most of which centers around Brad Pitt's sword play, braided hair, or nude body. "Alexander", by contrast displays its homosexual themes openly and unapologetically. The dude is gay. Many men were in the Ancient Greek world and it didn't have the powerful political and cultural reverberations that it does today in Victorian America.<br /><br />While I was happy that this film "owned" it's homosexuality more that the other two, I found it very boring. The dialog was trite and tiresome, the themes (as with any Oliver Stone movies) were flagrantly demonstrated and incredibly boring, and the actor who played Alexander was unbearably dull. In "Gladiator" Russle Crowe commanded the screen. No matter how goofy that movie got at times, Maxiums had my attention because Crowe played him beautifully. While "Troy" was not as good as Gladiatory, Brad Pitt played Achilles with all of his strengths mainly in the form of boyish attractiveness and athleticism. But "Alexander"--oh man--dull, dull, dull.<br /><br />Gay, yes, but very very dull.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hadn't Seen the Original, But This Version Was Good Too"></head><body><p>I know a lot of people loyal to the original would be more than happy to downplay this version.  I haven't seen the original to make an accurate comparison, but I though this was a well filmed movie.  I am impressed by the screenplay and the pacing.  We already see Dr. Benson's life get interrupted by the urgency of something that is a threat to national security.  The reactions to the whole situation are very realistic.  Connelly and Reeves do an excellent job carrying the story.<br /><br />What really makes the film convey the drama is the reactions to the situations which builds the suspense of the movie.<br /><br />Of course, there is nothing like the original, but this movie holds its own for entertainment.</p></body></html>

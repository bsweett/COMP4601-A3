<meta name="summary" content="Decent enough disaster film"></head><body><p>I like disaster films, but they are all, for the most part predictable. This is no exception but at least its a fun ride. Its kind of long too, but I didnt mind it so much. The action is the best part in this film. I loved the helicopter scene where they all just froze. Pretty amazing effects. I'm sure this film has a message that we should all be listening to, but it was awfully ridiculously quick how everything happened, and while I'm no scientist, I cant see all that happening in a span of pretty much 1 day. Other than that, its a pretty solid made film.</p></body></html>

Like the text the franchise is progressively darker, set in an almost post-911 world, following the disturbing events of the Goblet of Fire. Everything's changed... But not the superb casting with more Oscar Winners than you can shake a wand at, Oldman delivers again as Harry's Godfather Sirius Black aka Padfoot (the nickname is actually referenced in this one). Of course, this one has a climatic full scale battle of wands (the largest yet ) and Michael Gambon successfully dispenses Dumbledore's final duel with the Dark Lord a.k.a Tom. If you have the chance to see this in IMAX, by all means do so, oh yes!<br /> The story...<br /><br />Before Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) can even start their fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is attacked by Dementors, then placed on trail for underage magic  in front of a muggle. He isn't the only one under fire from a Minstry of Magic in denial, so is Hogwarts itself, when loathsome Dolores Umbridge, new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, played by Oscar winning actress Imelda Staunton, appears to oppress the place.  Failing to be taught actual defensive magic Harry and crew form a secret class of their own, but the newly revived Voldemort, again played by Ralph Fiennes, along with a face-full of Death Eaters including Bellatrix Lestrange played by Helena Bonham Carter (who I had in mind when I first read the book) and Lucius Malfoy (still Jason Isaacs), are plotting something nasty.<br /><br />Harry's rage and isolation is effectively portrayed, as is his edited relationship with Cho. Some of the novel's best lines remain intact here, like Ron and Hermione's assessment of Harry's kissing. Fred and George's exit from Hogwarts isn't altered enough to lose it's punch, neither is the film's exploration of teen rebellion and the consequences of becoming adults. Some of the films real heart comes from not only the brief moments between Harry and his godfather (Sirius gives volumes of exposition when refers to Harry as James during the climax), but moments between Harry and quirky Luna Lovegood, as they reflect on life, death and nargles.<br /><br />The effects are brilliant even though the CGI centaurs return, but thankfully do not speak or leave the shadows (see Sorcerer's Stone, yikes!), the other magical creatures look good, house-elves and horses alike. But ....the the wand battle will likely set a new standard for magic in film!</p></body></html>

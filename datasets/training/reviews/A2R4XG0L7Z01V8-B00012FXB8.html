<meta name="summary" content="The best of the series so far!"></head><body><p>So far my opinion on the first three movies have changed quite dramatically. Wasn't that keen on the very first one, thought the second one improved, and after watching the third, I really enjoyed it! I actually thought it was the best of the series so far! (Bearing in mind I haven't seen Resurrection at the time of writing this review.)<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of Ripley is getting better with each movie, and quite possibly, making it the reason why I like the movies better. I didn't think she could have surpassed her portrayal in the second movie, but in this she did. We get to see a very different side of Ripley, as she discovers she's the lone survivor, losing her 'adopted' daughter, Newt, and landing alone, on a prison planet, where the men are rapists, child molestors, murderers etc, and haven't seen a woman in years. Cue much shock when a battered and bruised Ripley walks in. And then we finally understand where Britney got her inspiration from!!! (Sorry it had to be said!)<br /><br />The film is made to be very claustrophobic I thought. Especially in the last act, where the camera is filming upside down. It's also different to the previous movies, with Sigourney now made executive producer, and the Alien is not scary as such, but it's taken on different characteristics. Alien 3 is also a lot slower paced, considering the fast paced, action packed James Cameron previous work, but in no means is it a slow film. It builds up the tension in such a way that before you know it, you're at the dare I say it, (almost) cliffhanger ending. How the fourth one came about I don't know, and I'm dying to find out.<br /><br />For any Casualty fans (that would be) in the UK, look out for Clive Mantle, appearing in a couple of scenes. He appeared as Mike Barrett for 10 years in Casualty, and I remembered him very well, although I was originally distracted by the fact that everytime I got told there was a guy from Casualty, Pete Postlethwaite always appeared straight afterwards!<br /><br />If it wasn't for the fact each movie was a continuation, I would have skipped out the first one, because it has paled in comparison so far to the second and third movies. I am definitely looking forward with curiousity to the fourth chapter, and to see what finally happens.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful Production Design & Execution"></head><body><p>When I first saw the 1951 animated version of  Disney's "Alice in Wonderland" I liked it immediately and it remained my favorite Disney animated feature ever since.  FIrst because of the funny and crazy design of the film and also because, as a radio listener,  I recognized most of the great voices used in the picture:  Ed Wynn, Jerry Colonna, Verna Felton, Sterling Holloway, et al.  When I heard that the Disney Co. had undertaken a remake of this story, I feared the worst: It would be modernized, it would lose  its charm and humor.  As is often the case, I was wrong:  The two versions are completely different in approach and both are most entertaining.<br /><br />The new film is a masterpiece of production design and wonderful characterizations given by a fine British cast.  Even beyond this are the amazing visual effects that give the Blu-ray version a real advantage.  Nearly every scene involves complicated processing which is seamless and impossible to analyze on first viewing.  The additional features, which explain how some of this was accomplished, indicate what a grueling effort the making of this film must have been.<br /><br />Mia Wasikowska is a lovely (older) Alice.  The Mad Hatter and the Red Queen are wonderfully played by Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter.  The voices used for various animated characters are superb choices:  Alan Rickman, Michael Sheen, Timothy Spall, Barbara Windsor, Michael Gough.  One remembers Michael Gough as an important player in the Alec Guinness comedy, "The Man in the White Suit," made by Ealing Studios sixty years ago and Mr. Gough is still working, bless him.<br /><br />Not to be repetitive, this film is one of the great examples of the advantages of Blu-ray.  Having both versions to compare, I was very impressed by the additional detail brought forward by Blu-ray and how much can be missed watching the standard DVD.  For example, at the very beginning of the opening title, it's very easy to miss the clouds briefly forming a smiling face across the moon.<br /><br />My only serious reservation with the new version is the annoying and inappropriate vocalizing  that is heard at the beginning of the closing credits completely dispelling the atmosphere left by Danny Elfman's superb score.</p></body></html>

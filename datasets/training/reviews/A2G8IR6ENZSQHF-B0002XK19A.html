<meta name="summary" content="A very entertaining and rousing comic book film"></head><body><p>I'm going to risk getting a bunch of "Unhelpful" votes now by saying this- "Spider-Man 2" is slightly overrated.  This is an entertaining and sometimes moving film, but it's not without its flaws.  Those who are saying this is the best comic book film ever have likely not seen many comic book films.  I found "Spider-Man 2" to be somewhat below such films as "Supermans I and II" (In fact, this film borrows some themes from "Superman II"), "Hulk" (for those who haven't read my previous reviews, I was one of the few that loved that film), and even the second "X-Men" film.  However, this is still a very good movie, and it will probably end up in my year's Top 10 list (out of the 50 or so films I see a year).<br /><br />Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst continue to be an appealing couple.  Really, there couldn't be a better Spider-Man than Maguire.  My personal favorite of the acting jobs is JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, who gives the film all of its funniest momemts.  I honestly believe he should be up for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  Another stand-out is Alfred Molina, who makes Dr. Octopus equally sympathetic and dangerous.  The sole sore here is James Franco as Harry Osbourne.  I sensed that we were supposed to sympathize with him as well, but from the beginning of the film he's too angry and hateful.<br /><br />The action in "Spider-Man 2" is almost spectacular.  In this area, "Spider-Man 2" improves on the first one in almost every way.  My only complaint is that there's not enough of it.  The film feels about 20 minutes too long, and I honestly think that it could have done with fewer of Peter Parker's "agonizing over what to do" moments.  Don't get me wrong, the movie did need some of these scenes.  There are just too many of them, and things occasionally bog down.  However, the film corrects itself at the climax, which works both on an action-filled and an emotional level.  Needless to say, we can't wait for "Spider-Man 3".<br /><br />On the whole, I would say that "Spider-Man 2" is a huge improvement over the first film, which I was slightly disappointed with.  The acting is even better, the villain is perfect, and the climax is rousing.  While I won't say "Spider-Man 2" is the best comic book film out there, it's a good way to kill a couple hours, and to give yourself an adrenaline boost.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Epic Sea Adventure"></head><body><p>Russell Crowe (Capt. Jack Aubrey) stars in this classic sea epic about naval warfare during the Napoleonic wars.  The year is 1805 and Napoleon's armies are set to invade England.  The world's oceans have now become battlefields as well.  The French frigate Acheron has been sent to the South Atlantic Ocean to journey around South America and into the Pacific Ocean to raid English whaling vessels.<br /><br />Capt. Aubrey's vessel, the HMS Surprise, stands in the Acheron's way.  After a battle off of the Brazillian coast in which the Surprise suffered considerable damage, the French ship made good its escape.  Faster than its English counterpart, it is able to increase the distance between itself and the slower British ship.<br /><br />During the course of the movie, the viewer gets to experience sailing, sea tactics, and life in general aboard a sailing ship.  Young officers who were in fact pre-teenage children were routinely placed aboard these vessels to learn the art of seamanship from the more experienced crewmembers.  Capt. Aubrey lends in his navigational talents to the training.  Battles are ferocious and often deadly, and young and old alike are the unfortunate casualties.  The overcrowding, poor food, and mental stress of being cramped on a ship for months on end is accurately portrayed, as well.  However, the men are sustained by the thrill of the chase and moments of courage, especially by Capt. Aubrey.<br /><br />Tough choices are made as well, such as when one of the crewmembers is swept overboard, but Capt. Aubrey is forced to make the agonizing decision to leave him behind rather than risk his ship and crew.<br /><br />Starring along with Crowe is Paul Bettany, who plays Dr. Stephen Maturin, the ship's surgeon.  He provides a kind of antithesis to Capt. Aubrey's sense of duty.  The pair play music together, eat together, and get drunk together, and there is a true sense of trust and friendship among them.  While chasing the Acheron, the Surprise stops in the Galapagos islands, where Dr. Maturin discovers many different species of animals, but Capt. Aubrey informs the doctor that the Surprise must resume the pursuit of the Acheron.  This decision drives a wedge between the Captain and the doctor.<br /><br />Upon sighting the Acheron, Capt. Aubrey comes up with a plan to disguise his ship as a whaling vessel in the hopes of drawing the bigger and heavier-armed Acheron closer.  The plan works, and a teriffic sea battle ensues.  Will the Acheron win, or will Aubrey's Surprise pull of a "surprise" of its own?<br /><br />This is an excellent movie.  The action is non-stop, and Russell Crowe does a magnificent job as the charismatic Capt. Aubrey.  Life aboard a sailing ship in the early 1800s is accurately shown, and the sea battles are truly exhilarating.<br /><br />I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Fans of great sea action and adventure will surely enjoy this great movie.</p></body></html>

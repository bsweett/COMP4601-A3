<meta name="summary" content="Watch those foxes and you'll see what's really in the subject's heart"></head><body><p>Yes, Timothy Treadwell was certainly narcissistic; he clearly tried to create a personality that screamed "hey, look at me!"  And his life among the bears was just as much about filling certain voids, disappointments, and shortcomings in his own life as it was about protecting the animals.<br /><br />But, oh, those animals.  There was a genuine rapport between Mr. Treadwell and his subjects.  It wasn't just in his head.  The way those little foxes followed him around all during the movie (playing with him, sitting on the roof of his tent, etc.) will break your heart.  Maybe the bears ultimately didn't have a clue, but those little foxes knew that Timothy Treadwell, whatever else was going on in his head, genuinely loved the wild denizens of the Alaskan wilderness.  So, for me, the central tragedy of the movie resonated well beyond feelings of "well, his death was a shame but he kind of asked for it."  Or, to put it another way, though a definite animal lover, this cynical reviewer doesn't usually anthropomorphize our four-legged friends, but I somehow know that those foxes mourned and were saddened by their strange human companion Timothy Treadwell, so that made me mourn Mr. Treadwell, too, at least more than I would have otherwise, if I'm honest.<br /><br />On the special features front, an excellent look at the scoring sessions of the film, rich with comments and input by director Werner Herzog, further enhanced this special little film.  I enjoy special features that genuinely illuminate the creative objectives of a film's director, and the way his or her process fulfills those objectives, and this fifty-plus minute extra feature did that nicely.<br /><br />This unique film, perhaps the first genuine "constructed from found footage" project (unlike the enjoyable yet ersatz docs "The Blair Witch Project" and "Cloverfield) is highly recommended for documentary fans. Its strange and moving portrait is one for the ages.</p></body></html>

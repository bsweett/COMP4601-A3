Eastwood hits all the right notes.  A story with character that isn't totally PC, but certainly sends the right message veiled in a devil may care heroine.  There isn't a wasted scene in the movie.  If the language puts people off, they never spent much time with their grandfather or great uncle.  Much less about rascism or violence than I expected and firmly focused on love, loss, and purpose.  Easily one of the year's best movies.</p></body></html>

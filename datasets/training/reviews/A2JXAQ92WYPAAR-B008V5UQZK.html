The acting is fine, of course, but finally it is the writing. The script is fantastic, a work of genius. What is so great is the author's ability to catch at each turn those little, tiny moments that say so much. The running gag over the Windex, for example, is hilarious, especially when the WASP groom takes it up. It shows the new connection between the father and son-in-law, while obviously just being silly. The film takes up a classic fish-out-of-water plot but, by emphasizing the cross-cultural connection, the story seems fresh and new. Both families are priceless. The characterization is so finely tuned, so accurate and true to character. Take the aunt, for instance: how funny she is when Toula's soon-to-be- husband announces that he is a vegetarian. "You don't eat no meat?" she says with some astonishment. Then: "OK. I'll make lamb." There are running gags, but also deep themes such as self-discovery, love, loyalty, and so on. The mother's heart to heart with Toula in the bedroom brought tears to my eyes. It is a deep movie, but light-hearted, inspiring, and loads of fun.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One Hour Photo: Version 2.0"></head><body><p>I originally rated this film 3 stars, so I went back and changed my  review to 2 stars.  I guess I gave it pity points, not fully realizing how stupid this movie was.  Not being a fan of Robin Williams in the first place, this film had to really sell me on it's strong points and give me a good reason to like it, and as you can see, it failed miserably. Come to think of it, I don't think I've liked a single movie Robin Williams has been in.  Wait, there's one, "Shakes The Clown".  And to further illustrate my point on how horrible this film is, I will include one sort of funny anedote bordering on the surreal.  I was at a Hollywood Video the other day and saw a clerk rounding up a huge stack of previously viewed copies of "One Hour Photo".  He brought them behind the counter and began chucking them in the trash, with much vigor.  I, being the curious video store patron asked him what was going on.  He remarked, "we've got so many, we don't know what else to do with them".  I laughed at his comment and further explained I had seen the movie and understood the unpopularity of this particular DVD.  He then scoffed a bit and asked me if I would like a free copy before he trashed the rest of the lot.  I thanked him for his offer, but declined.  Point being, they can't even give this horrilbe film away.  Strange but true.</p></body></html>

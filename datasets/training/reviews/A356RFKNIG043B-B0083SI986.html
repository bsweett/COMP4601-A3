Clint has made some real classics, and this ranks with any of them in its own unique way.<br /><br />Schenk's script keeps getting better as the film moves along; the opening scene is almost ham-handed exposition, telling us everything we need to know right away instead of showing it. That's the weakest moment of the film, though, and as we dig into Walt's character Clint informs him with many perfect and telling details, visually and verbally. Eastwood is totally inside this role, an absolutely masterful performance that should have won the Oscar hands down, and his direction is equally crisp. Rarely has a director acted so well, and vice-versa.<br /><br />There are many perfect moments here, from Walt's family trying to make sure they're in his will but never spending time with him, Walt's exchanges with his barber, his love of his talismanic Torino, and above all his growing love towards his Hmong neighbors. One of the best things about the blu-ray version is the extra doc about making the movie, a very fine little piece with some great Clint interviews that makes clear how careful he was to get all the cultural details right in this (very rare) cinematic look at Hmong culture in the US.<br /><br />Here we see a very mature Eastwood, in all the best ways. Dirty Harry has progressed into the sort of quietly loving being that was his destiny all along, and I believe that's what my Dad always loved about Clint: under all that toughness and edge is a truly intelligent and compassionate man who knows that the underdog is oft worth fighting for, and that the values we carry in our hearts are what define us in our most difficult times. The old Clint revenge motif is as usual in full force, but this time there's more soul in it than is sometimes the case, and the unexpected ending truly makes it clear that Dirty Harry and the Man With No Name have learned a lot in the past four decades.<br /><br />We've been watching plenty of films this very hot summer (thank goodness there's no global warming! It would really be hot, not just 105 most every day for the past month), and this is one of the only ones I can recall where about halfway in I suddenly hoped the movie would never end. I wanted to see Walt grow and develop; Clint's performance is just that good, certainly one of his best.<br /><br />There is also a lot of wonderfully wry humor, especially if you know any semi-bigots who are deep down very just and decent people. Clint's not afraid to poke fun at himself or Archie Bunkers or anything else by this point, and there are some hilarious lines that come out of nowhere. Walt's little grunts say more than any dialogue. I don't think Walt would ever say "colored guy", but Clint's knowing that the N-word would unnecessarily offend a lot of folks makes that line acceptable if unrealistic in this context. It's one of the film's few odd moments but doesn't detract at all.<br /><br />The music is also very fine, simple but moving, and Eastwood's son Kyle (what a great name, another sign of Clint's genius) has progressed a lot in the last 20 years. If Clint's basic but heartfelt singing over the credits doesn't bring tears to your eyes, you're a stronger man than I, and welcome to it. When Clint makes you cry you know something special has happened; this is a long way from Detective Callahan and even Unforgiven, another masterpiece.<br /><br />But the best thing here is the growth of Clint's love for Thao and Sue, his young Hmong neighbors who show him more real love than his own family. The bond between Walt and Thao is one of the more touching screen relationships I have ever seen, and it really becomes affecting as the film evolves. Wonderful acting from both of these hitherto unknown players makes this movie glow with a feeling unlike anything Eastwood has ever done, and it's seeing one of our great American film heroes become Walt so completely that makes this movie truly special.<br /><br />I had no idea this film would be anywhere near this fine, and rarely have I missed my Dad more since his death. He would have loved Gran Torino in so many ways, and I can't recommend enough that any fathers and sons out there see this film together. It has a lot to say about men and how we relate to each other and ourselves. It made me realize yet again that my old man knew what was up in many ways that only getting older can reveal to me, and that I sure was lucky to have him for a father. Any film that can bring that home so forcefully, and with so much laughter amongst the pathos, is nothing other than a true classic.<br /><br />This movie will live a long life and eventually be seen as one of the finest of our era. It's a fitting end to Eastwood's stellar career, one of the American cinema's most interesting. Or is it the end? Clint, man of many surprises, may still have one or two up his sleeve....<br /><br />Not bad for a 78-year-old old man.</p></body></html>

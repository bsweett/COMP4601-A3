<meta name="summary" content="Touching story!"></head><body><p>"The Polar Express" will be a Holiday classic. Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis hit a homerun with this all digital film. The story will hit the hearts of every child and adult.<br /><br />You will believe after watching this classic.<br /><br />Basically the plot is about a boy who questions whether Santa Claus is real. He hops aboard the Polar express to the North Pole to find Santa Claus's home on Christmas Eve. A cast of categorized kids are along for the ride of their life.<br /><br />I watched this movie with my kids. (Nine, seven and two) I was skeptical of the all digital characters at first, but that quickly faded as the story developed. The nine year old questioned the funny looking kids too, but I said it was a movie magic and that was the end of the questions. They were hooked. I especially was surprised by my two year old who sat through the entire film. Now that is movie magic.<br /><br />I got hood winked into feeling the emotions of the kids on the train. Before long I was shedding a tear along with my kids. I BELIEVE I have to give this DVD a must buy.</p></body></html>

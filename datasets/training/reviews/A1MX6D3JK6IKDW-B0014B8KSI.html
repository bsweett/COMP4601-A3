This mature legal drama is , to me, too convoluted to be fully enjoyed in one viewing. After a second viewing, things really fell into place. Swinton masterminds a plot to buoy herself in a corporate law firm position, while hiding a major gaffe in a fertilizer deal on her part years ago. Taking advantage of the firm's best lawyer's bi-polar disorder, and Clooney's financial and domestic woes,Swinton swoops in, has her henchmen murder  the ailing lawyer, then makes her fatal mistake by firebombing Clooney's car, with our protagonist not in his auto as  expected. On the pinnacle of success, Swinton has the tables turned on her by Clooney, much to her chagrin,much to Clooney's exhaustion and despair of the "system". Normally a 5 star special for me, any movie that takes 2 full viewings to comprehend loses 1 star from this reviewer.So,it's a very fine production, not a great one,</p></body></html>

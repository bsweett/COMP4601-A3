<meta name="summary" content="An unexepected delight with lines you will remember"></head><body><p>When you see the trailers and see Will Ferrell in that dumb Elf suit it is easy to dismiss this movie.  Just don't give in to that first impression.  This is a very funny, often witty, sometimes delightful film.  It has a very good heart and Will Ferrell gives a performance with an amazing innocence.  Yeah, I know.  This is the same guy who gave us "Old School" and "Anchorman".  But this is better (although I liked "Anchorman").<br /><br />Here you have a guy, Buddy, who ends up being raised at the North Pole among Santa's elves as if he were just another Elf.  A huge elf.  There are some very funny scenes at the North Pole that lead to him being told by Papa Elf (drolly played by Bob Newhart) that he is a human.  Buddy is sent to New York to find his father (played to perplexed perfection by James Caan) who is on the Naughty List.<br /><br />Much of the fun in the film comes from the predictable cluelessness of someone raised as an Elf at the North Pole trying to find his or her way in New York City.  However, there is such freshness to the approach in this film that it is positively joyful.  Buddy interprets things literally with a good heart and everyone views him as being impossibly clever and full of cynical motives or dangerously insane.<br /><br />One of the great moments in the film comes when Buddy takes his new friend who happens to be a girl, Jovie (played by Zooey Deschanel with an inviting softness), around New York for a tour of his favorite places.  I won't spoil this delight for you.  However, one of the great lines is simply a toss away, "Watch out for the yellow ones.  They don't stop!"<br /><br />Did I expect a movie like this?  No.  Am I happy my expectations were not met?  You bet!<br /><br />Recommended and for any time of the year.</p></body></html>

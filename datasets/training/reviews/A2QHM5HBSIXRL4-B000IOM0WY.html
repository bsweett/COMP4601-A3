<meta name="summary" content="Stolen by Green, Mos Def, Statham...and 3 Mini Coopers"></head><body><p>'Italian Job' was a definite surprise for me - a lot better than I expected.  Ostensibly starrring Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron and Edward Norton, this movie is completely stolen by six co-stars, Mos Def, Jason Statham, (especially) Seth Green...and three Mini Coopers.<p>Mos Def shows good comedic skills as explosives guy 'Left Ear.'  Statham - of 'Lock, Stock...' and 'Snatch' fame - is suave and cool as wheelman 'Handsome Rob.'  But Green is the scene-stealer here. As Wahlberg's computer expert, Green's movie-long rant about *he* was the true inventor of Napster is a pop-culture thing of beauty.  [Nice little non-speaking cameo appearance by Shawn Fanning brings an added level of authenticity.]  <p>Green also provides the comedic highlight of the film - providing some private, imagined dubbing on a conversation/pick-up between Handsome Rob and a cable technician named Becky.  It had the entire theater in hysterics.<p>In regards to the Mini Coopers, this might be the best product placement in recent memory.  The cars look fabulous here.  The marketing value to BMW is incalcuable.</p></body></html>

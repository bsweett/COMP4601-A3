<meta name="summary" content="A NOSTALGIC SPOOF OF A ONE TIME POPULAR TELEVISION SERIES..."></head><body><p>This is a silly but somewhat funny spoof based on that seventies something television series by the same name, which starred Paul Michael Glaser (Starsky) and David Soul (Hutch) in the lead roles. In this film, Ben Stiller plays David Starsky and Owen Wilson plays Ken Hutchinson (Hutch), a pair of cops in the free wheeling, psychedelic haze of the nineteen seventies. Both are viewed as problem children by their superior officer and, consequently, are teamed up as partners. The film is really about how Starsky and Hutch met and became partners, something the television series never addressed.<br /><br />Ben Stiller is his usually wacky self as the straight arrow, by the book Starsky, while Owen Wilson positively shines as the laid back, irrepressible Hutch.  Owen Wilson's natural comedic gifts allow him to effortlessly steal every scene in which he is featured. He is positively infectious! Snoop Dogg does a good job of reprising the role of Huggy Bear, the street informant that keeps Starsky and Hutch in the loop in terms of criminal activity afoot. Snoop Dogg infuses the role with a sort of natural cool and is funny in his own way, though not as endearing as the original Huggy Bear was in the television series. Still, he makes the role his own, as do Stiller and Wilson with theirs.<br /><br />The movie has a silly plot involving cocaine dealer/business man Reese Feldman, played by Vince Vaughn, who injects the character with  just the right amount of sleaze. It appears that Feldman has just come up with a new cocaine that will fool any drug sniffing canine. It is left up to Starsky and Hutch to stop his nefarious scheme, but not without getting themselves involved in some nutty situations along the way.  Look for Justin Bateman in the small role of Friday, Feldman's sidekick. Will Ferrell has a small, but pivotal, role as Big Earl, a guy with a dragon fetish who has some information that Starsky and Hutch need badly enough to...well, see the film. Carmen Electra, Amy Smart, and Juliette Lewis round out the cast and provide the babe factor.<br /><br />The film is a retro look at the nineteen seventies from its fashions to its  music. Look for cameo appearances by Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul. To my surprise, Glaser looks a whole lot better than David Soul, who appears not to have aged well. As to the overall rating of this film, I realize that this film may have limited appeal. Those who liked the Starsky and Hutch television series or who are fans of Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson will probably enjoy this goofy, spoofy, sophomoric little film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Duty First"...."This too shall happen to you,Mr.Blair...quite suddenly,without warning!""></head><body><p>I still stand in amazement that Peter Morgan's ingenious and character-angst rich screenplay THE QUEEN did not win the 2007 Oscar.Sometimes I just sit back and sigh and say "What the....." when Awards are bestowed.<br /><br />Revisiting THE QUEEN, now, after first seeing it in the theatres,I was struck with how utterly prophetic Peter Morgan's script so aptly directed by Stephen Frears is.Helen Mirren, unquestionably "queenly" in her inhabitation of Queen Elizabeth of England, prophetically proclaims to Tony Blair (after the whole Diana funeral had come to a close) how incredibly difficult and hurtful it was to her to see that 1 out of 4 Brits actually hated her during her indecision with protocol over Diana's death.Mirren advises quite soberly."It will happen to you Mr.Blair...quite suddenly,without warning!" Were ever more Royal expressions  more true.<br /><br />The one genius of this script is that it not only attempts to humanize and demonize The Royals and the new Prime Minister,but it shows the inescapable political charade that all parties were forced to play in a moment's notice.Princess Diana has died.She is no longer a Royal.Tony Blair has just won a landslide victory for his Party,and Queen Elizabeth if forced to face 1000 years of Monarchical Protocol in the light of such sudden events,especially in the light of her disapproval of Diana AND the new Prime Minister.<br /><br />What a travesty that this film was only recognized with one single Oscar-that of Helen Mirren,who rightfully deserved it.How many times have I heard, "OH,the movie where Helen Mirren plays The Queen!".But this film is so much more than the acting of Helen Mirren.Michael Sheen as Tony Blair is every bit as important in making this film work,and the Alexandre Desplats soundtrack and the adept direction of Stephen Frears made this SUCH a neat,tidy,seamless and "positively practically English" look at how world leaders deal with events.<br /><br />Well. Mr.Blair IS gone from office..."quite suddenly, and without warning" and The Queen STILL sits upon her throne.This film should be rewatched often and with great warning to those in high offices. The Queen eventually did what was right for the people,even though everything in her said "NO".Oh,Mr.Blair....why did you not heed your own advice?</p></body></html>

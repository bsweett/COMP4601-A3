Unlike most love stories where the events unfold predictably and there are no major problems along the way, this one is wrought with disasters. Cecilia Tallis (Kiera Knightly) is a wealthy girl from a well-to-do family. She is the epitome of the well brought up girl; she's beautiful, she dresses well, she is charismatic, and she's smart. It is no small wonder that one of the house staff is enchanted with her. Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) is well educated but comes from a poor background, so he is not the ideal mate, but the mutual flirtation between this couple betrays their hidden desires. Enter Briony (Saoirse Ronan), Cecilia's younger sister with a vivid imagination and a crush on Robbie. She glimpses a few moments in the couple's flirtation with each other and assumes the worst and jeopardizes their happiness together.<br /><br />The story is uneven; it is exciting right from the start, but the excitement seems to wane a bit in the middle. It suffers from confusing moments and some pretentiousness, especially the long take on the beach during the war. It seems director Joe Wright wanted to do something to prove his abilities, but its gratuitousness seems more like showing off than anything and detracts from the quiet beauty of the rest of the film. Events continue to drag on, and right when one starts to lose interest, the story catches you and pulls you in hard. The ending is heartbreakingly memorable and an unusual finish to such a love story.<br /><br />This movie should have won the Oscars for best cinematography and best art direction. It is absolutely gorgeous to look at from the color choices to the framing of each scene. Looking back, there are so many vivid images to remember, such as Briony walking through the floral arches in the garden, the seductively rich colors in the study, the grey streets during the war... What is amazing about these choices is that in spite of each frame looking like a painting, the sets seem very real and lived in. This movie does not take on the staleness of the typical historical picture; all of the actors seem comfortable in their costumes as if they were their daily dress.</p></body></html>

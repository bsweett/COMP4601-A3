Though he did not win the Oscar for Best Director (that honor went to Peter Jackson for "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"), Peter Weir has been nominated several times in the past for Best Director for the films "The Truman Show" (1998), "Dead Poet's Society" (1989) and "Witness" (1986). He also directed the films "The Year of Living Dangerously" (1982) and "Gallipoli" (1981), for which he won the prestigious Australian Film Institute (AFI) award for Best Director.<br /><br />"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" was based upon the 1970 novel "Master and Commander", written by Patrick O'Brian (1914-2000).  The novel was the first in a series of 21 novels featuring the characters Captain Jack Aubrey (of the British Royal Navy) and his friend, the surgeon Stephen Maturin.  The final incomplete novel, which was only half-written at the time of Patrick O'Brian's death, "The Final, Unfinished Voyage of Jack Aubrey", was published in 2004.  Having co-written the screenplay with John Collee, Peter Weir's film adaptation of "Master and Commander" begins onboard the British Naval warship christened HMS Surprise off the coast of Brazil circa 1805.  The ship's captain, Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey (the superb actor Russell Crowe), is under orders to find and stop a Napoleonic French naval warship, christened the Acheron, from creating havoc in the Pacific Ocean.  Unable to see well due to foggy conditions, one of the ship's minor officers, the tragic Midshipman Hollom (Lee Ingleby), momentarily catches a glimpse of an obscured object.  Alerting the ship, Captain Aubrey scours the horizon and sees bright flashes emanating from the fog.  Telling the crew the take cover, HMS Surprise is brutally attacked by the superior gun power of the Acheron.  Escaping into the fog, Captain Jack follows a course that takes the HMS Surprise around Cape Horn at the bottom tip of South America, then on a course that takes the beleaguered ship to the Galapagos Islands.  It is there that Doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), who is also a naturalist, takes a keen interest in the unusual species that inhabit the islands.  A Would-be Charles Darwin, Maturin wants to explore the islands, but Captain Aubrey's main interest is the pursuit of the Acheron.  However, an unfortunate gunfire accident encourages Captain Aubrey to return to the Galapagos Islands, which works out well for both his objectives and Maturin's naturalist hobby.<br /><br />With exquisite cinematography (for which the film won the Oscar for Best Cinematography), exciting naval battles, good acting and an authentic portrayal of the early nineteenth-century, "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" is an excellent film that is well worth watching.  However, it does a have a few flaws, with the largest being the complete lack of character development for any of the French warship's crew.  Instead, the Acheron and its crew is depicted as being essentially a buccaneer ship of bad-guys with nothing known about them or their mission.  Other memorable characters in the film include 1st Lt. Tom Pullings (James D'Arcy), 2nd Lt. William Mowett (Edward Woodall), the very young Midshipman Blakeney (Mark Pirkis), his friend Midshipman Calamy (Max Benitz) and Coxswain Barrett Bonden (Billy Boyd, who played the Hobbit Pippin in all three "Lord of the Rings" films between 2001 and 2003).  Memorable scenes include the foggy naval battle, the trip around the Cape, the arrival at the Galapagos, the accident, the surgery, the island walk and the final climactic scenes.  Overall, I rate the 2003 "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" with 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Doubt is not a one way street"></head><body><p>While this year's Oscar batch may disappoint the box office, I find the level of the nominated movies quite outstanding. 'Doubt' is one of the excellent movies in the competition; it is a theater play put on the screen with the best cast that you could find for it. Streep and P.S.Hoffman and two more actresses are in the race for acting awards, and that is well deserved.<br /><br />Streep is a self-righteous Catholic school principal in New York, a nun; she runs her shop by fear and mistrust. It is 1964. Hoffman is the parish priest, and he lives by different rules. She dislikes him for his kindness and for his popularity. He takes sugar with his tea! He writes with a ball-point pen! He is nice to people! He smokes!<br /><br />She is out to catch him with something, anything, and instructs one of her underlings to watch specifically for odd behaviour. The young nun reports that she found one of her 12 y old students, the only black boy, an altar boy, visibly disturbed and smelling of alcohol, after a meeting with the priest.<br /><br />Streep's character picks on this piece of incomplete information and blows it out of proportion. She goes head on for the confrontation, and of course nobody can win against the kind of allegations and suspicions that can grow out of it. The two lead actors carry the confrontation. A mediocre cast would have run the movie aground.</p></body></html>

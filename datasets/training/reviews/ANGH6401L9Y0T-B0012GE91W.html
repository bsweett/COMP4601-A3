But also as with all the others, the cutting was neatly done. I won't bother to mention what is left out, but concentrate on what is in.<br /><br />We start with an attack on Harry and his cousin Dudley (yes, a muggle) by a pair of dementors. What the heck are dementors doing in Little Winging? Really good question, since they're all supposed to be at Azkaban, guarding the prisoners. That there is a massive breakout of convicted death eaters later in the movie suggests that something is very wrong indeed with Azkaban. Has the Ministry of Magic lost control? If so, who has gained it? Voldemort?<br /><br />Anyway, the Order of the Phoenix rescues Harry from Little Winging and takes him to their headquarters in London, a house Sirius Black inherited from his family. There's a family tree tapestry that has several burn marks on it, including where Sirius' entry was. We don't get much chance to see the rest of the tree, though. And Creature has only a very minor role.<br /><br />Harry discovers that the Daily Prophet has been cooperating with Cornelius Fudge in a campaign to blacken Harry's and Dumbledore's names, apparently because Fudge is worried that Dumbledore is raising an army to fight the Ministry because Dumbledore wants his job. That's nonsense, of course, although there eventually is a "Dumbledore's Army" in mocking response to Fudge's paranoia.<br /><br />There are a lot of sub-plots that are somewhat distracting, but they are all there for a reason. Harry's infatuation with Cho Chang, for example, becomes important when she [not her friend, as in the book] betrays the DA under veritaserum interrogation. And Hagrid is missing the first semester, but that becomes significant because he brings back his half-brother Grawp, who ends up being more significant to the elimination of Dolores Umbridge than he had in the book.<br /><br />Dolores Umbridge is the most obnoxious Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher the school has ever had, which is saying something. She is what we used to call a pink and black witch. In fact, I don't recall that she ever wore robes like the other teachers. She wore pink fluffy things, mostly very silly-looking stuff. She talks in a high-pitched kindergarten teacher voice, and is enormously silly. But she is vicious, really vicious. I will leave it to the movie to express just how vicious she can be.<br /><br />Since Umbridge will not teach DADA correctly (she has them copying a beginner's book three times, so that they remember it, but does not teach any real spells), Hermione persuades Harry to teach those who want to learn for real, and creates the DA: Dumbledore's Army, named to mock Cornelius Fudge's paranoia. They discover the Room of Requirement, and learn a great deal until Umbridge discovers them and puts them out.<br /><br />Then there are Harry's dreams, and something which is more than a dream for him. He dreams about Mr. Weasley being attacked by a large snake, but he's aware of a point of view that suggests he IS the snake in the dream. When he wakes up, he wastes no time reporting this to Dumbledore, who moves fast to investigate through the portraits of former headmasters in his office, who can visit other portraits of themselves elsewhere and report back to Dumbledore within minutes. One goes to the Order's headquarters one to the Ministry, and then to the hospital where Mr. Weasley is taken after he is discovered in the Ministry, badly injured.<br /><br />But then Harry starts dreaming of other things, chiefly a closed door in the Ministry of Magic, and a long black corridor, and eventually a room full of glass globes. Finally, he dreams that Sirius Black is in that room and being tortured. He decides to go to London to rescue Sirius, and several members of the DA insist on coming along: Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville and Luna Lovegood. And without going into detail, they recover the prophecy (that's what those glass globes were) that relates to Harry and Voldemort, and they fight the death eaters who show up with Voldemort to try to get the prophecy back from them. Then members of the Order of the Phoenix show up, and fight the death eaters, too. Sirius is killed in the process, by Bella Lastrange. [Who, by the way, looks nothing like what I imagined her, but is very effective.] Finally, Dumbledore shows up and fights Voldemort to the point where he is vanquished - not killed, but vanquished.<br /><br />It's a terrific movie, possibly the best of the series so far. Even though a great deal was left out or truncated from what was in the book, the cuts are well made and the story is completely engrossing.</p></body></html>

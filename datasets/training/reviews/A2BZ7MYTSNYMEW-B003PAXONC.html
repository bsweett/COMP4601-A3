Meaning it's the end of the world, and either there is one survivor or a few, but the results are the same...people really discovering how to survive during the end of days. Ex-Military researcher, Nevell is apparently immune to the very real vampire-like virus that has completely devastated New York City (in the future). Alone with no one but his dog (his wife and daughter were killed), and a variety of strategically placed mannequins, Nevell appears to be handling solitude, as anyone would (with a touch of madness). In a city filled with deer, wild animals (they obviously got out of the Zoo), Nevell spends his days hunting those that are ill, and his nights hiding out in his well fortified home. Unfortunately, things change as we see other survivors and the very beings that Nevell thought were so unintelligent (and without meaningful brain activity) being more intelligent (well at least the leader) than first believed.<br /><br />I enjoyed this story, although I wasn't particularly fond of the ending. I think that in a time of great despair and hopelessness, we see a man that was able to survive, with his sanity (well not exactly) and his sense of purpose. And I really think that it takes a great actor, to be able to portray loneliness so well. Will Smith did a wonderful job!</p></body></html>

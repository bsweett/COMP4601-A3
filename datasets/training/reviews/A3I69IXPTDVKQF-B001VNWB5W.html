<meta name="summary" content="Dark, Awesome Superhero Epic"></head><body><p>One of the darker and most apocalyptic comic book adaptations yet to make it to screen, Watchmen is a super-powered epic in a dystopian world where the lines between right and wrong have been blurred and danger and doom seem to be closing in on all fronts.  It's famous for its darkness and its view of a cynical world, but I think it's going too far to call Watchmen a nihilistic movie.  For every look at the broken society it tales place in, every moment of human depravity, and every shade of despair, there's also an unexpectedly bright glimmer of hope, a chance at redemption, or a moment of tender beauty.  And of course, it all takes place in an action-pached, visually awesome panorama.<br /><br />  Taking place in an alternate version of 1985 America where superheroes and supervillains have existed since the late 30s and have changed the course of world history (including a quick ending to the Vietnam War that saw Vietnam become the 51st state), Watchmen opens in a dark, cynical world where a nuclear showdown between the U.S. and the Soviet Union seems imminent.  Superheroes - except for those acting under the auspices of the U.S. government - have been banned for several years now, although some rogue crimefighters still continue on in the shadows, such as the masked, highly violent vigilante Rorschach (played by Jackie Earl Haley).  We see through flashbacks how the relationship of superheroes, the general public, and the government had changed over the decades: originally greeted with great enthusiasm, beating back a crime wave in the 30s and 40s and helping to win World War II; the backlash a few years later including the hate crime murder of the openly lesbian superhero Silhouette and her lover, as well as the locking away of various costumed crimefighters into mental hospitals; the superhero rennaissance in the 1950s with the appearance of the first truly superpowered hero, the godlike Dr. Manhattan (played by Billy Crudup); the formation of the Watchmen with sincere hopes of saving the world; and the twilight of the superhero age with conflicting agendas between the heroes and the government, rifts within the superhero community opening up due in part to the increasingly open hyper-violence of characters like the 'superhero' The Comedian, public panic, and finally the banning of costumed crimefighters.  (And this is just the backstory to the main tale!) Which brings us into the movie's present, where Dr. Manhattan is one of the only 'legal' superhumans (who would be difficult to ban even if he weren't working alongside the government - his power surpasses that of the combined might of all the world's conventional and nuclear armies) - and the mentally unbalanced Rorschach leads a brutal one-man war against crime, while possessed of a seering hatred of the very world he's supposedly protecting.  And most of the former costumed heroes have simply slipped back into the fabric of society and are leading relatively 'normal' lives, their secret identities still mostly unknown.<br /><br />  Yes, it's difficult in the beginning to tell who the good guys are and who the bad guys are, and to some extent even after the movie's conclusion it's up to the viewer to decide who falls under which heading.  It's made somewhat clearer as the flashbacks bring in the long-standing motivations of various characters, as well as their often tragic pasts.  In my mind, by movie's end, there actually are some characters who deserve to be filed as true heroes, there are definately some true villains, and there are a lot who straddle that blurry line.  The lack of the movie clearly identifying in its early chapters who you're 'supposed' to root for and against ends up as a plus rather than a minus and fits in with Watchmen's somewhat non-linear storytelling.<br /><br />  After Rorschach decides that the death of one of the supposedly retired members of the old Watchmen team was actually a murder, he gets it in his head that someone's coming after all past and present superheroes, and attempts to enlist other former Watchmen to form a resistance.  He also seems to feel that this ties in to some grand conspiracy that's going to usher in the end of the world.  Largely dismissed as paranoid by his former peers - and with understandable reason given his increasingly erratic and hostile behavior in recent years - later events begin to add credence to at least some of Rorschach's theories.  But can he put the remaining members of the Watchmen back together, and if so, will that save the world or somehow destroy it?  In the overall story that, with flashbacks, covers years, we see heroes unable to stop the chaos in the world from spinning out of control and nearly go insane from it; we see heroes fall from grace and try to crawl their way back up; we see villains recognize at last the horrors of their own atrocities and attempt to go straight - or do they?; and we see the most powerful being on the planet slowly start losing the ability to relate to humans or to perceive existance in the same way mortals do.  In many of its instances Watchmen is as it's been touted - heroes struggling in an uphill battle to make a difference, and not always succeeding.  In other cases though it's a case of the Villains doing exactly the same thing - trying to make a difference and not always succeeding.  Because in the minds of most (not all) of the movie's real bad guys, they Think that what they're doing is for the greater good.  And what's even more potent than having them just all be insane with really twisted views of the world, when you see their reasoning and their goals, it often makes a horrifying kind of sense.<br /><br />  There's more subtext to the movie than could be discussed here.  A few random observations - the musical score and the use of various songs fits in absolutely perfectly with the onscreen happenings; the sudden return of two supposedly retired Watchmen to save the trapped inhabitants of a burning skyscraper is one of the most dramatic and awesome movie moments I've ever seen; the physical battles are incredible; the constantly changing patterns on Rorscach's mask are freaky cool; and Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre II is possibly the sexiest super-heroine yet seen on screen.<br /><br />  Watchmen succeeds hugely on multiple levels.  It should be noted that though this is a superhero movie, this definately isn't something to get in for your seven year-old Spider-Man/Iron Man fan (those movies are great too, but in a different way).  A grand, disturbing and enthralling epic.</p></body></html>

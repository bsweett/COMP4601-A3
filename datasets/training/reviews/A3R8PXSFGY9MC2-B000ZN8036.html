<meta name="summary" content="Into the Wild"></head><body><p>'Into The Wild' is a very gentle, introspective film that had me engrossed the whole way through. Emile Hirsch's performance draws you immediately into his characters (Chris') pursuit of a free, unfettered life, in touch with nature and it's finer elements. You understand his idealism and his strong focus to achieve his aims. Sean Penn directed this film superbly. One part that stands out is when Chris goes into a big city and his feelings of disconnect and alienation. Penn manages to show these emotions (using various film and camera techniques) with real skill and you feel as awkward and out of place as Chris does. The soundtrack is awesome, with music by Eddie Vedder and it really adds to the overall feel of the film. You can really see the benefits of this type of lifestyle and a part of you yearns to follow the life Chris did and to experience life, relationships and nature on a fundamental, stripped back level. Having read the book I was aware of the general story and this film is remarkably faithful to it, there are very few deviations. In addition, I felt none of the frustrations with Chris' attitude that I felt when reading the book. Being portrayed on the screen and acted so well, I understood the mindset a little more. He is shown to be more naive in the book than in the film, but this made the film a better viewing experience, they are different media after all. This film offers some insightful ideas and philosophy, but you aren't spoon fed them or have them rammed down your throat, which is a refreshing change from a Hollywood film. With amazing locations, excellent acting, top direction and an inspired soundtrack this makes for one great film and one I highly recommend.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

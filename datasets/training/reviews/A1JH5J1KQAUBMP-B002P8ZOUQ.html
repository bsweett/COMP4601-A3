Jackman remains the perfect embodiment of Wolverine and Schreiber makes a scary Sabretooth.  It covers a lot of ground and none of it is great filmmaking, but it provides a lively and entertaining history for the character and has plenty of good action scenes.  There's a nice tie-in to the first X-Men film with a surprise cameo at the end.</p></body></html>

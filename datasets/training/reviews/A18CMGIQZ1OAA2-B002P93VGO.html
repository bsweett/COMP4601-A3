<meta name="summary" content="not to think too much on"></head><body><p>i love the comics. x mens always been my favorite series other than when i was little and i was all about superman. All the xmen movies are different than the comics. theyre comic inspired action movies BUT i love em. hugh jackman is so cool. Hes an awesome adaptation of wolverine. In this one i loved how they pulled in scott without really pulling him into it. I really like liev shreiber and was happy they picked him to play a young sabretooth. It was a fun movie. i watched it in two settings so im not giving it a full 5l Lets face it if it was the best thing ever i would have watched it all the way through.  Like all the others, when you match up this to Xmen first class which timewise fall close things just dont add up but like i said not to think on much. Not my favorite but the last comic movie i saw was Green Lantern and haha anythings a step up from that.</p></body></html>

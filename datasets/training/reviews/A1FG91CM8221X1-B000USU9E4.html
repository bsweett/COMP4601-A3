Jackson and Affleck certainly didn't disappoint, and the film provided a decent share of thrills and suspense, yet it left me oddly unmoved at the end. After thinking about the movie, I know why: "Changing Lanes" focuses so single-mindedly on Jackson and Affleck that no one else registers. Every other character is a plot device existing only to influence Jackson and Affleck in their escalating war against each other. The only exception is Toni Collette as Affleck's colleague and ex-lover, and her character becomes steadily less significant as the film progresses. Thus the film becomes simultaneously too claustrophobic and too scattered; since Jackson and Affleck share very little screen time, they spend most of their performances wandering among ciphers. This is too bad, because Jackson's controlled rage--which suddenly flares with hellfire fury--is very impressive, as is Affleck's delicate balancing act with conflicting feelings of smugness, frustration and remorse. Those two fine actors make "Changing Lanes" worth seeing--but at a bargain matinee, rather than at full price.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Human Side of the Monster"></head><body><p>"Downfall" is actually a very story sad story to be told. The film comes through and shows everyone that the man who was responisble for the death of 6 million Jews actually had a human side as well. This is what makes the movie sad, with everything that has been said about him all of these years, people forget that he is human as well. Bruno Ganz does an excellent job as Hitler. He does bring a human side to the movie. The script is very well written. After watching, I can see why this film won so many awards</p></body></html>

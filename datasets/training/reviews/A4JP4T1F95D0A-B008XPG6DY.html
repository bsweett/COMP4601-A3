You have a talented cast, a decent story, and a fair ending that isn't the greatest, but is not a total dud.  It's hard to describe the movie too much without spoiling it.  So I will simply say that a married man decides to have an affair, and that turns out to be the biggest mistake of his life in more ways than one.  This movie is worth a watch.  I'm not sure about the replay value since it isn't a big enough twist that you want to go back and look at any clues you might have missed ala The Sixth Sense.  But it is not a bad film.</p></body></html>

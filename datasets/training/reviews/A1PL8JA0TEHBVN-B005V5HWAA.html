<meta name="summary" content="Everything is near perfect here. Cast, screenplay, direction, music... all great!"></head><body><p>It is rare to see so many great elements brought together in a typical genre movie. MR. BROOKS is the proof that, from time to time, a great film comes by and renews our faith in genres.<br /><br />It is a precise and suspenseful thriller/domestic drama with depth, humor and some true great moments.<br /><br />Mr. Brooks (COSTNER)is successful man. He is happily married and has a teenage daughter. And he has a secret: he has an imaginary friend (HURT) who compels him to murder. Again and again. So Mr. Brooks is the "Thumb print killer" who's being hunted by a relentless detective (MOORE) with problems on her own. But being rich and intelligent, Mr. Brooks never makes a mistake. Or does he? One night he gets photographed by his latest  victim's neighbor who makes him a proposition: "take me with you".<br /><br />And that's just the beginning because from then on, everything will fall on top of Mr. Brooks: dealing with the police, dealing with his daughter (who too has a secret), dealing with his blackmailer, choosing a next victim, trying to quit... etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />I recommend this film to all of those who like a great screenplay with great characters and great actors who really enjoy their roles (you can really see Costner and Hurt enjoying themselves through each scene). It all makes this film a joy to watch.</p></body></html>

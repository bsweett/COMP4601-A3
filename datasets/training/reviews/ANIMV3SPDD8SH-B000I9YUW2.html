<meta name="summary" content="FORGETTABLE"></head><body><p>A woman is told her nine year old son, who reportedly died in a plane crash, actually never existed. Is her missing son part of a diabolical plot or is she merely delusional? Unfortunately, it's the former, and the 'diabolique' comes in the form of modern movie super-villains, (think X-Files). A schizophrenic would have been far more interesting, but it moves along swiftly, like a glossy moralistic episode of 'The Twilight Zone', and never tries to be anything more than a big budget 'B' movie for bean brains.</p></body></html>

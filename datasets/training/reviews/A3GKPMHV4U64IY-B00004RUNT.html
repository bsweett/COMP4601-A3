<meta name="summary" content="Silly, Fun, Visually Stunning"></head><body><p>I finally managed to see The Fifth Element on a screen larger than my television.  I found it quite fun as long as you don't take it too seriously.<br /><br />Every five-thousand years a force of pure evil enters the universe.  In Egypt is an ancient weapon that is the only thing that can stop the evil.  The four elements of earth, air, fire and water surround a fifth element and thus form the weapon.  Aliens decided the weapon was not safe where it was so they took it with a promise to return it at the right time.<br /><br />In our future, the time arrives and we don't have the weapon.  Luckily the aliens contact us that they are on the way.  But space pirates blow them up.  A few cells are found and cloned into a woman.  She links up with a cab driver and through some convolutions of plot, the two go off to Fulston's Paradise to collect the four elements.  Once the elements are collected and taken to the proper location, there is still the question of activation.  Eventually this happens, the evil is thwarted, Earth gets a new satellite and we get a James Bond ending.<br /><br />I already told you I thought the movie was fun so I will now tell you why it is silly.  The cloning was really funny.  The being in question has fifty times the DNA as a human but the scientists can still read and understand it.  The clone is actually built and not cloned.  Little robotic arms build a skeleton as if using Lego blocks.  The internal organs and muscles are woven onto the skeleton with a device Ronco used to sell to kids.  After all of that they have to trick the body into growing skin by using ultraviolet bombardment.  Skin growth takes less than a minute.  The resulting clone has dyed hair; bright orange with blonde roots.<br /><br />The Federation President is another matter all together.  For one, he seems to be patterned after a certain Star Trek officer.  Secondly he shows no real control or competency.  Considering the role of the media in the film it is hard to believe that the weak-eyed, lisping man could have been elected.  Much of the action occurs on a cruise ship while it is in orbit.  While in orbit various characters feel that the way to accomplish their goals is to cause large explosions on the vessel that is keeping them alive.  Not even the passengers are worried about this.<br /><br />But despite all of the silliness it is a fun movie.  There aren't many films these days that are both bad and entertaining.  Not like in the good old days.  So for a little escapist entertainment I have to recommend The Fifth Element.</p></body></html>

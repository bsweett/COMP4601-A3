<meta name="summary" content="Most over-rated movie of the year, obviously"></head><body><p>This is the movie of the year?  There're dozens of foreign films out there with similar stories, and more beleivable.  Did the academy get all mushy and bleeding heart overnight?  First of all, the story lacks plausibility and very high on coincidence many times.  The back and forth between the game show and his dubious story is grating.  Secondly, the movie is terribly dark about India.  Supposedly everyone there is a con man, pedophile, or mafia thug.  The movie is more of a condemnation than glorification of India.  And how about the part where they fall off the train and land right in front of the Taj.  India's such a small country, I guess that happens all the time??  And the tourists give the kids a $100 note, what?  There are just way too many trite and serendipitous things that happen in this movie, and the ending obviously is way too strongly telegrahed.  It seems the credulous members of the academy don't get out much to the foreign cinemas and are entraced by negative stereotypes and fairytale story lines.  This movie was quite disappointing and is a malignment of the human condition.  But hey, it had the millionaire format, so that was cool right??  thumbs down</p></body></html>

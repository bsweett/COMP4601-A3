<meta name="summary" content="Art Meets Life"></head><body><p>We've all heard about the Oscar recognition afforded this film for its acting.  It is well deserved, to be sure.<br /><br />I really loved the writing, though.  Great art delights the observer, as this movie certainly did, but it also provokes thought.  This movie refused to advocate for any one viewpoint on the British monarchy.  It constantly challenged the viewer's perceptions and beliefs about the role or importance of the British royalty, as well as its foibles, and was greatly entertaining in the process.  I like my viewpoints challenged, and that certainly was the case here.<br /><br />Some would call that shifting gears or even audience manipulation.  I would not, not at all.<br /><br />I finished the movie still thinking (as I did before) that the amount of money and attention spent on the British royalty could much better be focused elsewhere, but at least had to concede, grudgingly, that royalty had (and has) some broad purpose.  I was not expecting that from this movie, and was delightfully surprised.<br /><br />You will be, too - this was definitely one of 2006's best efforts.</p></body></html>

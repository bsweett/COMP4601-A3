<meta name="summary" content="Sweet revenge"></head><body><p>Given how average lots of comic book movies have been nowadays, I didn't expect to like this one as much as I did. I am not familiar with the Punisher comic books, so I can't compare it to the movie. However, on its own, the movie is actually a pretty good one of revenge and repayment after a man's family is gunned down. Some of the twists are quite entertaining, so I feel confident giving this movie four out of five stars for a worthy effort and decent writing and action.</p></body></html>

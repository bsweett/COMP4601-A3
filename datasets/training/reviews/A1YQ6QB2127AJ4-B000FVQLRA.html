<meta name="summary" content="Intense Life Story During the Holocaust"></head><body><p>"The Pianist" is one of the top 10 best films of 2002.  It was rightfully nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture, going on to win three: Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay.  Its true story of world-famous pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, who struggles for his life during the Holocaust is very powerful, yet brilliant.  The hardcore drama begins the moment his passionate music career becomes threatened by Hitler.  Its material is close to as graphic as the actual conditions, which is how it should be displayed.  Such intensity, which is never lost for a second, guarantees an emotional reaction.  All the emotions in the scenery and through the characters are heartpounding through Szpilman's entire unfortunate journey.  The immense research of these events is present.  The writer's own heart and soul was written in every word.  This project was wonderfully led by Roman Polanski's brilliant vision.  His directing talents answer why he deserves his legendary status.<p>The set scenery is as accurate to the actual buildings and living conditions of Europe in 1939-1945.  The hard work through the construction paid off, adding extra living intensity.  The clothing worn in the movie adds the necessary emotional value that keeps audiences watching.  All other physical details in this film are also flawless, namely the make-up and the dirty scenery (dirt, burns, blood, etc.).  The musical score was composed beautifully, blending perfectly with every scenes' particular mood.<p>The performances from all the actors are beyond words.  Adrien Brody beautifully portrays Szpilman in his career-launching role.  His every drop of heart and soul are obviously presented through his character.  This is one of the best Holocaust movie roles in cinema history.  His talents prove that he'll be around for many more years.  A few other actors could have received Oscar nominations for their supporting roles without critic complaints.<p>"The Pianist" is a great movie for entertainment and education.  This future classic is sure to please many audiences.  Those looking for more perspectives on the Holocaust should also watch "Schindler's List", which offers a more graphic look.</p></body></html>

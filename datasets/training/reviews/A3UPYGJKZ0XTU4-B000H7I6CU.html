It rolls his love of NASCAR and fondness for the family road trip into a children's morality tale with a little history lesson. The world of "Cars" is a populated by driverless autos, so the characters are all machines. A hotshot, rookie racing car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) who thinks of nothing but winning the Piston Cup has one week to get to his race in California. But a mishap en route lands McQueen in traffic court in the southwestern town of Radiator Springs. The town judge, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), wants the arrogant little racer out of town ASAP, but Porsche prosecutor Sally (Bonnie  Hunt) wants McQueen to pave the town's dilapidated main thoroughfare instead, in hopes that it will bring travelers back to the Route 66 town that they abandoned when the interstate was put through. McQueen is loathe to miss his race, but the townsfolk and a hillbilly tow truck named Mater (Dan Whitney) may change his priorities.<br /><br />"Cars" is an attractive film that smoothly integrates two aspects of car culture -racing and road trips- into a lesson about friendship and respect and a little history of Route 66 towns. But the script is pedestrian. It's hard to believe that someone thought a bunch of bickering over paving a road would be entertaining. You can tune out large sections of this movie without missing anything. "Cars" has a lot of technically impressive animation but really only engages visually at the racetrack. It opens with a bang as cars whiz around the track at the Piston Cup and closes in the same vein, with the tiebreaker race, which is much more involving. I can't say if children would enjoy "Cars", but, at 1 hour and 54 minutes, it is tedious and way too long. Since "Finding Nemo", Pixar has lost its flare for clever dialogue and distinctive animation that adults can enjoy too. To my mind, if a film is too dull for adults, its' not worth a child's time either. Pixar needs better writers.<br /><br />The DVD (Pixar 2006): Bonus features include 2 animated short films, 4 deleted scenes, the movie's epilogue, and a documentary about the inspiration behind the film. "Mater and the Ghostlight" (7 min) is a short film in which Mater gets his comeuppance for playing practical jokes. "One Man Band' (4 1/2 min) is a short film unrelated to "'Cars", in which a couple of street musicians duel for the approval of a little girl. "Epilogue" (4 min) is the last part of "Cars" that played over the credits. In "Inspiration for Cars" (16 min), John Lasseter talks about merging the worlds of racing and road trips, the decline of Route 66, and shares part of the Route 66 road trip that the filmmakers took with "Route 66: The Mother Road" author Michael Wallis. Subtitles for the film are available in English only.</p></body></html>

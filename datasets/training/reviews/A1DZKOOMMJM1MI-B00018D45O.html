<meta name="summary" content="Stylish but violent!!!"></head><body><p>The remake of the 1974 chiller The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a stylish, atmospheric film, which unfortunately resorts to blood and gore to tell its story. It's a simple story that starts off like any other slasher pic from the 70s and 80s. A carful of sexy teens pick up a hitchhiker, get stranded and become prey to a murderous villain. Unfortunately for the teens in this film (and the original), the villian is not one, but a whole townful of grotesque, psychotic killers. What follows is definitely suspenseful, but uncomfortable to watch and truly hard to sit through. This is one of the most disturbing and violent horror films in recent memory, but did hold my interest because of the great cast and creepy atmosphere. Daniel Pearl, cinematographer for the original 1974 version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, reprised the position for this movie, which I thinl greatly benefited it. However, while the original relied on suspense and a feeling of dread to scare the audience, this film just tries to gross them out. I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised. I just wish it didn't have to be so violent.</p></body></html>

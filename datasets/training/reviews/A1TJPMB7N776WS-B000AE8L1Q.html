<meta name="summary" content="Women Are Different"></head><body><p>Having grown up in a house of women, I can relate to the domestic set-up that director Mike Binder has concocted in his film, "The Upside of Anger."<br />Women have a special world all their own that few men have the opportunity to penetrate unless they've grown up around or spent most of their life with them: more to the point,listened intently to what women have to say and closely observed how they act and react to things.<br />As Denny (Kevin Costner) says when he has dinner with Terry Wolfmeyer (the radiant Joan Allen) and her four daughters (Kari Russell, Evan Wood, Alicia Wood and Erika Christensen): "I can't get over this....this is all so girly." And he isn't being negative, he is merely pointing out the obvious: women are different than men, and in this situation, because they feel comfortable in front of Denny, these ladies have let their guard down a bit and shown him a little of how the feminine mind operates.<br />Terry has lost a husband to another woman and she is not one bit happy about it. She is depressed, she is drinking too much, and she is turning inward and shutting out her four daughters: she is in mourning and she doesn't want sympathy, she wants revenge.<br />Joan Allen has never been more human and funny and her Terry Wolfmeyer is not above pettiness, pouting and acting like a horse's pattootie. She has been a good wife and an even better mother and she, rightly so, feels that she doesn't deserve this betrayal.<br />Costner here is so far removed from JFK and The Postman or any of his hero roles that he is almost unrecognizable: he's gutty, sloppy and he's always got a can of Bud in his hand. His Denny is someone who has never been without female companionship yet craves the warmth of a family. Think Jack Nicholson in "Terms of Endearment" with a big bleeding heart.<br />"The Upside of Anger" is too long by at least 10 minutes but nonetheless it is a warm, funny and thoughtful film. Savor its simple pleasures while you can.</p></body></html>

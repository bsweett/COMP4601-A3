<meta name="summary" content="Needed Kane Hodder"></head><body><p>This movie has the typical formula for a modern day horror film; Blood that looks too fake, a cast of teens you would see on an MTV show, a couple semifamous stars, sex, violence and gore, and drugs. This movie was for the Nightmare on Elm Street fan. Freddy had most of the film and yes, I know Jason cant talk. It was good to see Freddy in a film again though. Robert Englund is a treat to watch, i'd highly recommend him in 1001 Maniacs. It had a good plot but the cast was really annoying. Also, Kane Hodder, the Jason in the last four Friday films, was left out for a unknown actor. Hodder was the best Jason and his presence in this movie is missed. A good movie with a few good fight scenes between Jason and Freddy. The killings in this movie weren't really speical. Id recommend it to people who love horror or just have every Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th dvd.</p></body></html>

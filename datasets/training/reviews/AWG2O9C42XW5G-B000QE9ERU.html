<meta name="summary" content="The punisher Rules"></head><body><p>This is a remake of The Punisher Made back in 1989. Well I will have to say that i'm not the one for remakes. but the director and producers pulled this one off. this remake is just as good as the first movie. And Thomas Jane was Perfect For the role as The Punisher and John Travolta was Perfect For Howard Saint. this movie is awesome. If you have not seen this movie then you should.</p></body></html>

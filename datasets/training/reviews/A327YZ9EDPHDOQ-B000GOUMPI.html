<meta name="summary" content="Winter time with the Torrances...Here's Horror!!"></head><body><p>Jack Nicholson is one my favorite actors (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,A Few Good Men,Anger Management and his latest  coming soon,The Bucket Trip). I will admit The Shining stands as a movie in which horror comes alive thanks to Jack's role as Jack Torrance. He delivers a solid performance as the caretake along with his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and their son Danny (Danny Lloyd). A good beginning but the action picks up when cabin fever begins to set in on Mr. Torrance and, well, you have to find out for yourself. Just be careful if someone carries an ax around the premises!</p></body></html>

His daughter, played by Maggie Grace (Lost seaons one and two) goes to Paris with her friend, all with Mills' reluctant permission.  Mills then goes into hyper drive working to find his daughter, reaping vengeance along the way.<br /><br />Neeson is very strong and the mood of his intensity is set from the beginning.  He has friends who he was worked with in the past that give us a view of what he was like before he retired to be close to his daughter who lives with ex-wife (Janssen).  The movie helps us to appreciate Mills who after years of neglect, feels a need to be there for his kid.<br /><br />The movie takes us to Los Angeles and to Paris.  There are some very interesting chase sequences, one in a construction site at night, interesting sensation for sure.  There are a few intense fights that are seemingly unrealistic, however, who cares, he is trying to save his daughter.<br /><br />Each encounter with the bad guys gets more and more intense.  The movie crescendos at last with a fight scene on a yacht.  Better than any James Bond type of view, and very interesting indeed.  I think this could be a prequel with Mills and his friends doing their actual work.  I think it would make an interesting story line.<br /><br />I got the Single Disc Extended edition.  Not sure what was added that the movie lacked in the theater.  This is a great movie as I watched it.  This disc was a little lacking in extras, that I would loved to have had to fill in some of the details of the whys and hows of the movie after the fact.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is really good viewing overall.</p></body></html>

This country is located in the middle of Africa, which has flourishing green forests and hills.  The Canadian Lieutenant General Rom&eacute;o Dallaire who was assigned as commander of the United Nations troops in Rwanda called it heaven on earth before the three dreadful months in 1994 when nearly a million people where murdered and maimed.  Hotel Rwanda illustrates one man's struggle for survival while trying to save as many as possible, as his nation turned into hell on earth, a hell that the Western World could have prevented, but decided to ignore, as it probably did not seem important or profitable.<br /><br />A sad issue with the Rwanda genocide is the Western World's decision not to exercise previously learned knowledge from what happen at the Evian Conference of 1938 when the Western World closed its borders to German-Jewish refugees.  This was a decision that cost more than six million Jews their lives, as it indirectly gave Hitler the notion that the world did not care for what happened to the Jews in Germany.  A recent documentary, Shake Hands with the Devil: The Journey of Rom&eacute;o Dallaire (2004), could help shed some extra light on how the world disregarded the events in Rwanda, as it depicts Dallaire's attempts to get help and his own perspective on his situation in Rwanda.  A situation where Dallaire was left in Rwanda with a mere 300 soldiers for an assignment required at least 5000 soldiers, as he helplessly could hear and see victims being butchered that were left to rot on the streets.<br /><br />A question rises when one hears about this dreadful story.  Why did people not pay more attention to the murders in Rwanda?  Several notions come to mind such as the war in former Yugoslavia and the people's fascination with O.J. Simpson's glove size.  These news stories took up more coverage time on the news than Rwanda, as almost a million lives were scuffed into the slots to fill time in between news and commercials.<br /><br />A black screen opens Hotel Rwanda, as the audience can see the opening credits and hear radio broadcasts from different radio stations.  Through these radio broadcasts the audience quickly learns where the Western World is focusing its attention, the war in the former Yugoslavia.  Another broadcast provides more in-depth information on how the radio helped spread lies that fed the hatred and anger against the minority group Tutsi.  These broadcasts where frequent, but no one tried to prevent them.  In the documentary of Dallaire the audience can learn that the Catholic Church could have helped lessen the effect of these radio broadcasts, but did not try to spread the word on a wide-ranging level.  It was simply ignored, as many thought that these Hutu extremists were simply crazy, as they ran around in their colorful outfits screaming prejudicial statements against the Tutsi.<br /><br />Amidst the anger and hatred a luxurious hotel, the four-star Hotel Des Milles Collines, functions as an oasis of delight.  The Des Milles Collines has a skillfully diplomatic manager by the name Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), who knows what to say, what gift to offer, and how to make people feel good at all times.  The work at the hotel takes up a lot of Paul's time, as he frequently finds himself missing out on vital information in regards to what goes on in the nation.  Nonetheless, he is grooming important relationships with key characters in the Rwandan government, which later will be of much use for him.<br /><br />In a meeting between the Hutu president of Rwanda and the Tutsi rebel leader arranged by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), whose real name is Rom&eacute;o Dallaire, both parties sign a peace treaty.  This was a treaty that many welcomed, as many believed that it would bring peace and calm to Rwanda.  However, shortly after the signing of the peace treaty, the President's plane is shot down.  The Hutu extremist's radio broadcast blames the Tutsi, which begins a three month long slaughter of the Tutsi.<br /><br />Paul finds himself in a predicament, as his wife and many of his neighbor's are Tutsi.  He makes the decision to help save them by bringing them to the Des Milles Collines through bribes and diplomatic poise with brutish soldiers.  It leads into an eye-opening beginning for Paul while many of his preconceived notions begin to break, as the truth leaks out.  In a strong scene between Paul and Colonel Oliver, Colonel Olivier describes for him how little this nation is worth to the Western World.  As a member of the enlightened and educated Western World, this scene will induce shame and guilt, as what Colonel Olivier states is the same thing the audience can learn from Shake Hands with the Devil: The Journey of Rom&eacute;o Dallaire (2004) where Dallaire explains how little he could do as he was ordered to do nothing.<br /><br />In a seemingly hopeless situation Paul uses his diplomacy in order to maximize the chance for survival, as he and others can bear witness to the madness outside the hotel's walls.  Poignantly genuine is the character that Don Cheadle presents, as he depicts a very humane person who realizes that he must use his powers to survive while trying to save as many as he can.  However, his performance also brings gut wrenching scenes where he stands strong in moments of immediate danger while also displaying moments of true emotions such as fear, happiness, melancholy, and despair.  The film's success rests within Cheadle's brilliant performance, which is highlighted by the talented cast that surrounds him such as Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, and Hakeem Kae-Kazim among many others.<br /><br />Hotel Rwanda provides a great opportunity for the world to experience the misery and fear that the Tutsi of Rwanda were subjected to during their persecution.  It could not be considered a wonderful film due to its grotesque nature, but it is an important film that should be seen.  The director, writer, and producer Terry George who previously has written screenplays for films such as In the Name of the Father (1993) and The Boxer (1997) displays his skill to tell the truth without shocking or displaying an overwhelming levels of the gruesome crimes that were committed in Rwanda during the spring of 1994.  Instead, he offers the Western World a moral lesson that should not be forgotten, as he leaves the audience with the story of Paul Rusesabagina and his selfless effort to save 1200 people.</p></body></html>

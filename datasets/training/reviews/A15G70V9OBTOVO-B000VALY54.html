<meta name="summary" content="Fun, well done."></head><body><p>There is something about this movie that makes people want to write reviews longer than the tax code but suffice to say, if you've seen enough Hollywood action spectaculars to realize how silly they are, you can't help but enjoy KKBB.  Its well written, everybody in it is perfectly cast and its surprisingly easy to follow for an intentionally non-linear mess.  It also manages to be funny and exciting while being totally absurd.<br /><br />The plot is intentionally too complex, the coincidences utterly implausible, the stunts are laughably over the top.  But that's the idea.  After seeing so many movies with "messages" about good, evil, life, death and infinity (usually based on comic books) its refreshing to something that's all in fun.  This is one movie where both the actors and the audience get to have a really good time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This was entertaining... not bad!"></head><body><p>Although "Eragon" is palpably derivative of a number of fantasy franchises ("Star Wars," "Lord Of The Rings," "Wizard Of Earthsea," et. al.) it is still quite enjoyable, if a bit on the lightweight side.  I have not read the original book, but coming into this blind, the film was about what I'd expected. Obviously it's been streamlined and no doubt dumbed-down a bit, but the special effects are good (the dragon, mostly, looks cool) and the story clops along at a decent pace.  Nothing here will surprise you, but it's hardly the dismal filmic disaster other reviews have implied... It's just a goofy, no-brainer Hollywood action film, good if you want something light.<br /><br />And the dragon looks cool.<br /><br />(Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)</p></body></html>

It works since J.J. Abrahams directed this like man version of  Alias. It works as part of the Mission Impossible film trilogy&lt; It works as a taut action adventure thriller. It works as a vehicle for Tom Cruise.<br /><br />It is not your father's Mission Impossible...it starts at a point towards the end and works back. The amazing thing you are drawn into this complex piece. The puzzle that this movie is sometimes gets overwheming<br /><br />there are a few missteps in the action and the ploting, However Cruise and compant shines in this twist and turn script with so many red herings.<br /><br />I will say Phillip Seymore Hoffman is a calm bad guy which works against Cruise's hot and cold action man. Ving Rhames is so under used in MI3. Michelle Monaghan is a star who shined as Cruise's love interest.<br /><br />it is a good action flick for those who crave action<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD</p></body></html>

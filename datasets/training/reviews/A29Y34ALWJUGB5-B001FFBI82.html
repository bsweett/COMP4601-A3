<meta name="summary" content="The Great Actors Makes This Movie What It Is"></head><body><p>I think that, without Jamie Fox or Jake Gyllenhaal, this movie would have sucked. Something about these two actors just seemed to click in the movie and the plotting. They acted their roles with brilliance and were as convincing as if they had actually lived the lives of the marines in this story.<br /><br />The story itself follows one marine through his training all the way up to the last hours of Desert Storm. During this time, we see a soldier's life during Desert Shield, before the war with Irag began, and just how difficult life was, and how boring as well. It is so boring, in fact, that the soldiers want nothing more than to put at least one kill underneath their belts. Yet Jake Gyllenhaal and his comrades are sniper scouts, marines who see little action as it is, and getting those kills is going to be difficult. What follows is actually a slow decent into insanity for some of the soldiers, or constant paranoia about life at home, and what they may be missing. When all put together, it's actually more of a character study than anything else, since Jake Gyllenhaal's character goes through all of these emotions.<br /><br />What I liked most about this movie was the simple fact that it's a true story, as well as it's based during the Gulf War. We get to see little of this relatively pointless war, and when a movie is made about it, I'm generally excited to see it. And thanks to some well-acted characters as well as the true-story backing, it adds some concrete to what had looked to be an unstable mix. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed Three Kings (the only other Gulf War movie I know of). It's a funny and occasionally emotional journey into the lives of some very bored marines.</p></body></html>

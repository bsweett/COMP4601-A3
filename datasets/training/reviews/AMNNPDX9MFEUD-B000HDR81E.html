<meta name="summary" content="The Unromantic Movie"></head><body><p>Some years back, a disturbing film called Fatal Attraction caused a big sensation by showing the absolute worst-case scenario of marital infidelity. Despite the near tragic climax of the movie, the viewer fails to see that the infidel learned his lesson and, to further obfuscate things, his adultery is overshadowed and practically pardoned by her mental instability. No deep introspection or navel gazing epiphany, just a close call and back to the way things were before. The Break-Up does a similar public service of sorts in demonstrating how bad things can go when people end their problematic relationship and similarly avoids addressing the root causes that created the mess. By the time The Break-Up ends, both partners have grown some, but not enough to make me believe they'll not make the same mistakes again. They have picked up the pieces and tidied up but you get the feeling that when it comes time to build again, it'll be the same old house of cards.<br />After a whirlwind dating period turns to co-habitation, the shine fades and things quickly come to a head, thanks to the selfish antics of male stereotype Gary (Vaughn) and his predictable inability to do little more than meet his girlfriend half-way and Jennifer Aniston's Brooke, who makes the fatal error of trying to change someone who is firmly set in his ways, yet another clich&eacute;. But, that leads me to the bigger flaw of The Break-Up; using formulaic Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus images, the movie relishes demonstrating how ugly the end of a relationship can be and how fast love can turn to hate, but it never addresses the problem on a deeper level and gets to the heart of the matter. People aren't clich&eacute;s and relationships aren't supposed to devolve into little more than glorified roommates who sleep together nor should they feel compelled to "save" what is already terminal. Yet, the movie is chock full of couples sleepwalking through the sad dance of relationship boredom and misses the opportunity to flush out why they willfully allowed themselves to become the soulless zombies they are. All of us have known and/or been in situations where it is clear that things aren't right and yet few ever seem to have the courage, strength, or sense of determination and foresight necessary to pull the plug. Instead, we soldier on despite the profound differences, boredom, frustration, lack of sex, existential angst, and, in some cases, a genuine dislike of each other, purely for some misguided sense of commitment, financial responsibilities, kids, or, the most popular reason; fear of being unattached and alone. And people perpetuate these mistakes in one relationship after another like lab rats that just can't figure out that the cheese comes with an electric shock. The Break-Up, whether intentionally or not, exposes the inherent fraud of lifeless, dispassionate relationships. It reminds us in one uncomfortable moment after another, what happens when the fa?ade is torn away. This movie is the antithesis of romantic and beneath the light humor and the two-dimensional roles, it serves up a cautionary warning for all of those desperate and fearful people who would rather spend nights next to Mr. or Ms. Wrong than rough it alone while keeping up the search. When you chose safety over risk, satisfaction over passion, or banality over excitement and romance you inevitably end with The Break-Up. Happy Valentine's Day.</p></body></html>

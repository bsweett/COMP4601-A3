<meta name="summary" content="Good scarry movie"></head><body><p>I have never seen the original, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one! Let me start saying, that I made a mistake of eatting dinner and watching this movie at the same time. Um, yeah, I could hardly chew, and it was only the beginning.<br />The cast is quickly overwhelmed by the unfamiliar terriotry, and sneaky people who aren't as helpful as they seem. It's in the middle of a hot, gross and sticky summer day.<br />Some of the scenes are brutal, but I did not see any cannibalism in it.<br />Nevertheless, the running, chasing, blood splattering, and the real suspence of what is next was great.<br />If you are looking for a heart tumping movie, the go for it!</p></body></html>

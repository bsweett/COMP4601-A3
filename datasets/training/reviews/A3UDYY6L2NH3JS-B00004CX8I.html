The film is great in itself to show how psychiatric hospitals are prisons, even voluntary prisons, when patients are made to believe that they are not ready to leave and go back home. It is also great to show how the patients become dependent on the hospital, the medication, the treatment and the personnel by being deprived of all control over their life or lives. They cannot decide anything, even by voting, even by having a majority in that vote. The personnel is ready to make the beds and the chairs vote in order for the patients not to have a majority. Even the simple things like cigarettes, television, card games or even taking a nap at will are denied or rationed to the patients and they become at least social vegetables, and at times physical vegetables. Jack Nicholson arrives in there as a tornado and creates havoc. He is absolutely perfect for the part, maybe because he plays a part he knows perfectly well, or maybe even because he plays his own personal part. And of course the system defends itself, lobotomizes Jack Nicholson and everything goes back to normal.<p>But the film is a metaphor of America, because only one will escape this hell : the Indian, who made everyone believe he was deaf and dumb. Indians are reduced to silence. But he escapes because he is stronger than anyone else, which means that he stayed because his world had disappeared, because his civilization had been destroyed. But he escapes and runs away across the countryside at dawn. This is in itself the central metaphor of the film : to be free you have to escape this society. To be free an Indian has to escape this white prison. But he escapes into a vast prairie, the vast prairie, and he runs away into that prairie in some surreal light : this is of course a metaphor of death and paradise for Indians. Hence there is no escape except into accepting imprisonment and being locked up in silence, or into death and eternal life that is nothing else but death after all.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Decent horror flick"></head><body><p>Tobe Hoopers 1974 Texas Chainsaw Massacre was one of the<br /><br />best horror films ever made. So what about this 2003 re-<br /><br />make? Well, It has it's good and it's bad... It starts<br /><br />out with 5 teens going to a Skynard concert. Problem is<br /><br />I highly doubt Jessica Biel has any Skynard in her coll-<br /><br />ection so it makes that part alittle hard to believe. But<br /><br />then the teens pickup a chick that is seemingly in shock.<br /><br />Things start to heat up when she seems them going toward<br /><br />the same place she was just coming from.. She grows really<br /><br />upsetand warns the teens of the danger ahead before putting<br /><br />a gun in her month and blowing her brains out. You would<br /><br />start to think that the teens would be wary of going any<br /><br />further but they continue on path until they reach a Bar-<br /><br />B-Q/Gas Station. They are then told they must go out in<br /><br />the countryside to make the report of the girl who commited<br /><br />suicide.<br /><br />This is where it all starts... We are lead to about an hour<br /><br />of grewsome murders and sickening personalities by the likes<br /><br />of a old man and a redneck cop(played by the Full Metal<br /><br />Jacket drill Sergeant)and of course Leatherface. What makes<br /><br />this film good is that the teens in this movie are better<br /><br />actors in the original with the exception of the lead female<br /><br />in the 1974 movie.<br /><br />We also get more gore than the original. That can be good<br /><br />some and bad.... The original wasn't just about murder, it<br /><br />was also about mental torture. This film doesn't have that<br /><br />going for it... In fact, Jessica Biel doesn't seem like all<br /><br />that much of a victim. It seems like despite the presence<br /><br />of Leatherface and the cop that she is still in control.<br /><br />What's good about the film is some good gore the movie<br /><br />gives you a chance to actually care for the victims in-<br /><br />stead of caring less. And as I said, it has better over<br /><br />all acting than the original... It's just ashame that<br /><br />the mental torture part of the movie was non existant.<br /><br />One major complaint... The movie had no special features<br /><br />at all. Come on, they can give us alittle more than a few<br /><br />repetitive trailers.</p></body></html>

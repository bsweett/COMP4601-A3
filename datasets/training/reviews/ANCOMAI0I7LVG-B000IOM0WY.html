<meta name="summary" content="So bad it's good; or so good you forget that it's bad..."></head><body><p>You know those films that you know are technically `bad' but that fill you with such giddy excitement you can't help but totally love them?  This is one of those films for me.  The plot is nothing short of ridiculous, completely unrealistic and none-to original, but I still can't help but totally adore this movie.  It is fun and exciting and intense, regardless of the predictability of it all.<br /><br />I haven't seen the original (staring the BRILLIANT Michael Caine) but I really should!<br /><br />The film revolves around a group of professional thieves who join forces with the daughter of a respected partner who was murdered and robbed by someone they trusted.  What follows is a slew of preposterous yet highly entertaining sequences of tricks, gadgets and slowly boiling sensual chemistry (Marky Mark and Charlize make a beautiful pair, don't you think?).<br /><br />Wahlberg is a reliable leading man.  He isn't doused with talent like some other actors his age, but he has a likable charm (that whole Brooklyn attitude sits well on him) and he knows how to work a scene.  Charlize Theron has talent (thus the Oscar) but she doesn't really use it in fluff films like this.  She doesn't elevate any of her scenes, but she is gorgeous, which is all this role really required of her.  Edward Norton is the most talented actor here (well, one could debate between him and Sutherland, but la'Donald isn't in more than five minutes of this) and he shows it by oozing a sensual creepiness that makes his irresistible and completely commanding.  That dinner confrontation scene alone is just jaw dropping intensity wrapped up in a dapper little package.<br /><br />The rest of the cast does their job.  Jason Statham is brooding and buff and a total lady killer; Seth Green is comic relief of the nerdy kind; Mos Def is quiet, charming and totally likable.  They work very well.<br /><br />The film is chuck-full of brilliantly paced chase scenes (those ugly little cars have never been so cool), beautifully choreographed action sequences (not to mention beautifully photographed landscapes) and clever tricks that gloss over the plot holes nicely.  With enough going for it to outweigh to stuff working against it, `The Italian Job' is one of those `bad' movies I can totally stand behind.<br /><br />It makes me smile.</p></body></html>

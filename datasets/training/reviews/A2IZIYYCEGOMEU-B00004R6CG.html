<meta name="summary" content="AN EXQUISITE NIGHTMARE"></head><body><p>VERTIGO is the most beautiful movie Hitchcock created, with stunningly brilliant cinematography, the magnificent costumes of Edith Head, and an unforgettable score by Bernard Herrimann. It is also perhaps the greatest romantic psycho-thriller of all time.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart as a retired acrophobic cop was never more compelling, or complicated, and Kim Novak as the breathtaking, and coldly sensual Madeleine, and the much less, refined Judy, was positively mesmerizing.<br /><br />The story is about a tragic love affair, murder, and madness. John, ( Stewart ) is so obsessed with his dead lover that he attempts to remake a girl ( Judy ), into his dearly-departed because of the strong physical resemblance she bears to the deceased. Judy has fallen so badly for John that she allows him to totally dictate her life ( Svengali had nothin' on this guy ). The performances of Stewart, and Novak resonate long after the movie ends ( of course, I have seen the film at least forty times... ).<br /><br />I personally found D'ENTRE LES MORTS ( the book VERTIGO is based on ) to be a little hyperbolic for my taste, but Samuel Taylor's screenplay breathed life into the characters.<br /><br />Much has been made about the famous 'dream sequence' in VERTIGO. The truth is that the entire movie is a dream- haunting, rhapsodic, and powerfully hypnotic.</p></body></html>

However, I have been asked by a few individuals to write a critique of this film, and so I have. I've never been a huge Rambo fan, and this film didn't change that for me. I've seen many dumb films in my life. Most of them are in the "so bad, they're good" category - as in all of Ed Wood's films and anything by William Castle - only they knew how to make B-movies FUN.<br /><br />This new installment of RAMBO (and hopefully the last) is so incredibly stupid, that I cannot believe that it was even greenlit in the first place. Sylvester Stallone is not an idiot. I've seen him in interviews, and he seems like a really cool, intelligent individual. He's even working on an upcoming bio-pic on Edgar Allen Poe, that he is planning to direct. I just don't see why he would waste his time on this disaster of a film, when he could have spent all of that time and energy on his POE project. Who knows? POE might actually be his first masterpiece, if he can stop wasting his time on blown up, macho doo-doo like this.<br /><br />Of course, there are those who care nothing for quality film - no doubt the types that would label indie and foreign films "stupid" will likely get a kick out of Rambo. It is a film for neanderthals, plain and simple. There is plenty of carnage, yes, but it has no soul. There is an inherent lack of creativity from the opening credits onward. This film was marketed to a certain audience - beer guzzling, uneducated rednecks who like to watch things go "boom boom". They can have Rambo.</p></body></html>

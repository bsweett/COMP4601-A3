<meta name="summary" content="I Think This Film Was Great"></head><body><p>Long as it was, it ended too soon for me. Some call this its famous director's flop, but I disagree. This tale of revenge, corruption, and of immigrants vying for a place in the landscape of American society balances fantasy and history and with its authenticity regarding period attitudes on race, ethnicity and status it is among the more courageous motion pictures made in a long time. As far as storytelling for the sake of storytelling goes, Gangs of New York gives three hours of great characters, intricate mid-nineteenth-century scenery, and a plot that never drags. Violent, mesmerizing, gritty, it is among Scorsese's top films, and Daniel Day Lewis deserved an Oscar for making Bill the Butcher the best cinematic villain so far in this decade.</p></body></html>

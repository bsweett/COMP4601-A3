<meta name="summary" content="Probably the best of the original Star Trek films"></head><body><p>Here, we have the cast of the original Star Trek Series on yet another adventure into the universe. This is a very focused and tight story with lots of action and a shrewd approach to expanding the story of an older, original Star Trek episode, "Space Seed".<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792160959">Star Trek - The Original Series, Vol. 12, Episodes 23 & 24: A Taste of Armageddon/ Space Seed</a><br /><br />It's all about a clan of genetically superior super-humans, led by a man with a Bonepartist attitude, (Kahn), who were once placed on a planet by Captain Kirk, to resolve the takeover of the Starship Enterprise by that group. There, they were expected to survive and create a new civilization.<br /><br />However, no one checked on their progress and things didn't go precisely as planned!<br /><br />The second plot is that a former lover of Captain Kirk's, (Kirk's illegitimate son is introduced to us!), a brilliant scientist, who has invented a device for "creating life" on barren planets, "The Genesis Project". The problem is, this device can also be used for planentary destruction because it obliterates any existing life where it is utilized.<br /><br />Kahn seizes upon a chance to escape the torment of his now barren world and seeks to steal the Genesis device and to get even with Kirk in the process. I'll have to stop there to avoid any major spoilers but, for fans of the original series, there is one heckuva MAJOR INCIDENT near the end.<br /><br />This is a superb family, sci-fi film that will stand the test of time. Don't miss it!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Monotonous Sadism"></head><body><p>I have a point in these gruesome "torture porn" movies where I bail on them and shut them off.<br /><br />When the victim somehow frees himself-but-it's-usually-herself and momentarily gets the upper hand on the psycho killer, they hit/stab/shoot/incapacitate the killer...and then run away.  Now the psycho killer has terrorized the victim, viciously murdered the second or third banana in the cast in front of them, and--these days--sawed off a toe or finger or ear or limb...but the victim will knock down the psycho and run away, leaving the psycho to gather his wits and come after them again.<br /><br />That happens in WOLF CREEK, another exercise in depressing sadism.  The surviving girls knock out the psycho killer (with a shovel, I think) and try to run away.  Just once I'd like to see a movie where the victim goes all kinds of crazy on the psycho with that shovel or club or whatever blunt instrument they use and make really sure he isn't coming after them again.<br /><br />But this is just another tedious movie where young women are tortured and menaced by some gleeful maniac.  These movies have gotten progressively worse since the original TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and HALLOWEEN.  Considered grindhouse drive-in trash back then, those two films are now the artistic classics compared to the monthly schlock foisted on us by Hollywood these days.<br /><br />Where are we at when we're using "tedious" and "torture" in the same sentence?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Rumor Has It"></head><body><p>The Graduate is a classic cult film, and since this movie was based on it, I was hoping for the best, but not expecting much.  I was never more wrong!  Jennifer Aniston was refreshing, but I had dry heaves when she slept with a man her mother and grandmother did especially when she thought at first he could be her father.  That is just not entertaining in any situation.  Kevin Costner was good in his role, but the ewwww factor was too much.  Mark Ruffalo gave probably his best performance to date.  The most surprising performance was from Shirley MacLaine, and she was absolutely fabulous.  She held her own in every scene.  It didn't matter who she shared screen time with, she stole the limelight.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Amazing Race"></head><body><p>Far too clever for it's own good and too proud of itself because of it, Paul McGuigan's "Lucky Number Slevin" tries its damndest to be as classy and intelligent as say, "The Usual Suspects" or even "Memento" but it's reach far exceeds its ability to sell a simple, though certainly convoluted story.<br /><br />Josh Hartnett (where the heck has he been anyway?) plays a youngish man seemingly involved with a number of iffy situations (as in murder, mayhem, mistaken identity, contract killing, book making...to name a few) most of which are thrust upon him...or not, I think.<br /><br />There are genuine moments of brilliance buried here among the dark, dank rehashing of been there, seen that plot threads so McGuigan definitely has talent. Add to this the bright, funny performance of Lucy Liu and the ironic, tongue-in-cheek one of Josh Hartnett and "Lucky Number Slevin" adds up to a pretty good though flawed film.</p></body></html>

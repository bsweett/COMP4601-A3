<meta name="summary" content="Del Toro's Best Film So Far!"></head><body><p>This is a wonderful film that includes magic, mysticism, and terror of a war.  A girl whose mother marries a Spanish fascist tries to cope with her stepfather's brutal personality, a servant's assistance to the resistance and her mother's poor health.  The magic helps project a world that is much safer and comforting than the real world.  A very moving movie and I just love it.  The extended DVD provides much more than the film and the extras are good.</p></body></html>

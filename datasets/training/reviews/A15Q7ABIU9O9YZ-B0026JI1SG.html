<meta name="summary" content="My darling. My blood."></head><body><p>A couple of points here. I'm a young guy, in New York, back from overseas, alone. It's 1976. I'm in my apartment. It's morning, I'm shaving. Gene Shallit is on the TV in the living room. He's droning on about something. Apparently he's seen a movie the night before. All I can hear him tell the blond 'hostess de jour' is, " . . . it's not about boxing."<br /><br />If Rocky I wasn't about boxing (the ONLY Rocky for you afficionados), then Million Dollar Baby (MDB) is not only not about boxing, it's not about Hollywood. MDB is a pulsating cut above the eyebrow of a brave fighter. It's a broken nose. It's a eye which will swell shut in about 90 seconds. It's life. That's all. No more, no less. The sweet science ain't sweet, and the joy of life when it comes should be both emptied and acknowledged.<br /><br />That Eastwood delivers a story about life, that Swank has so much wisdom with that darn hillbilly accent, that Freeman has so much dignity and insight like a soothsayer and visionary, is kudos to Eastwood the director, not the actor. (Although the actor is brilliant as well.)<br /><br />Margaret Fitzgerald is a down and out child-woman from humble beginnings. Very humble beginnings. She's 31 years old and wants to celebrate her birthday in Frankie Dunn's boxing gym, "The Hit Pit."<br /><br />"My mama's 300 pounds, my sister's pregnant. My brother's in prison. My pappy's dead. I'm all I got. And this is the only thing I got."<br /><br />That Eastwood as Frankie Dunn would become a father figure to her was not as clear to me as to some others and I felt was the easy explanation. That he would give her unqualified love and that unqualified love was available to her and that she could muster the willingness to accept it was the more substantial tour de force, I believe. That he had unqualified love to give is astonishing to him. It is a love that doesn't pander to the usual Hollywood confusion and dysfunction. It is just there. The dialogue between the Catholic Priest and Frankie would be priceless except for the dialogue between Eastwood and Freeman.<br /><br />You will think about the movie for months after you see it. It is not Michael Moore's rambling. It's not high tech. No Robots or sex. It's about us. It's about a lesson for us that we should know when we've done what we came for. I don't know that I've seen a better movie in ten years. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></body></html>

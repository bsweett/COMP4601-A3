<meta name="summary" content="Politics aside, this movie is a near-masterpiece!"></head><body><p>Forget politics for now. Even now, "Predator" is arguably one of my favorite action-science fiction classics that I still watch today.<br /><br /> Set somewhere in the treacherous jungles of South America, a team of U.S. commandos are sent down there to rescue a band of government officials who've been kidnapped by a squad of heavily armed insurgents in South America and a war ensues between. However, after the skirmish, both the U.S. commandoes and their South American foes start being killed, one by one by an unseen enemy that is not even of this world.<br /><br /> Now with both his comrades and enemies alike being killed off one by one, Dutch now is facing off against a deadly foe that is not a sniper but actually an alien that landed on earth and hunts for the sake of it.<br /><br /> Arnold is excellent once again as the macho protagonist main character in an action movie. In case you didn't know, the guy who played blain is Jesse Ventura! Both of them would go on to become governors. Arnold is governor of California and Jesse was governor of Minnesota for a period of time. While I've had mixed opinions of their views, I still love watching them in their roles in "Predator".<br /><br /> Although the age does show in some spots, the special effects are absolutely impressive especially taking into account that this was 1987! The way they did the extra-terrestrial being's face and scary looking mouth was awesome and gave me nightmares for a long time after first seeing the movie.<br /><br /> Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

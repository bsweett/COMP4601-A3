Despite a plot that includes lazy &quot;psychic visions&quot; and far too many supporting characters, this dark and bloody mystery/thriller from the Hughes Brothers is a success, thanks to a very intelligent script, engaging suspense, and terrific performances, particularly from Johnny Depp and Robbie Coltrane.  Highly recommended, and certainly one of the better thrillers I've seen in a while.</p></body></html>

Eli is strange and distant at first, but as the two grow closer, she reveals that she is a young vampiress who must consume blood to survive. LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is Tomas Alfredson's beautiful and captivating adaptation of John Ajvide Lindqvist's best-selling novel. It incorporates the coming of age theme with a budding romance, while molding the classic vampire mythos into something wholly original. Alfredson's restrained shooting style is subtle but extremely effective. By paring down the color palette to a collection of cool blues and grays, he not only emphasized the frigid surroundings, but also Eli and Oskar's icy dispositions leading up to their friendship. He then contrasts the bleak coloring with saturated reds as a form of foreshadowing. Rather than simply relying on computerized imaging to display her powers, Eli's supernatural abilities are implied just off screen in a number of cleverly crafted shots. A review of the film would mean nothing without mentioning the moving performances by Lina Leandersson and K?re Hedebrant as the two young leads. Because the majority of the picture is spent following their growing relationship, the more horrific moments become that much more shocking and unexpected. LET THE RIGHT ONE IN defies each of the recent trends in Horror by focusing on its compelling characters and touching love story over excessive amounts of gore and violence.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></body></html>

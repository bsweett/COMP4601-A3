It is enjoyable enough but after your done watching this confection is "So what?".  Jennifer Garner is utterly charming, as always, as Jenna, the teenager who desires to be an adult.  That said, even an actress as adept as Garner cannot overcome the lightweight script.  Garner, unlike Tom Hanks, has to hone her chops as a comedienne to carry a starring vehicle.  I'm optimistic that in the future that as she is given more opportunities(and better material) that the sky will be the limit for Garner.  Mark Ruffalo seems to fare better in this film, but the demands on him are not as great.  Special note should be made for young Christa Allen who plays Jenna at 13 and does an outstanding job.</p></body></html>

This time, in OCEAN'S THIRTEEN, it's even more personal as one of their own is unceremoniously victimized which results in his suffering a near fatal stroke. One of Ocean's elder partners in crime, Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould), against the advice of his friends, decides to go into a business venture with Willie Bank (Al Pacino, in very good form) as they build a new hotel in Las Vegas, called the Midas. Willie Bank has the rep for being two-faced and for pulling the rug out of his partners, but Reuben discounts it. This is a humongous mistake as Reuben is abruptly forced out of the partnership, and, to add insult to injury, the name of the hotel is changed from the Midas to the Bank. Soon, Ocean and the gang congregate in the hospital around Reuben's comatose figure and decide to get payback for the man. Six months later, the con to break the Bank begins.<br /><br />Watching this film series is like thumbing thru an issue of People Magazine or the Hollywood Reporter, there's so many stars to gawk at. Given, the love interests, Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta Jones, are regrettably absent because, as Ocean puts it, "It's not their fight." So, not much chance for a proper romance in this one, although Linus gets a half-hearted crack at it. But everyone else is back. The cast chemistry is still very much intact, especially between Clooney and Pitt, who've kind of become soul mates or something. Andy Garcia also returns as the reptilian Terry Benedict, who apparently has a beef against Willie Bank, and the actor makes the most of what is effectively an extended cameo. Matt Damon's Linus, still seeking the approval of basically everyone around him, gets a larger part in the con this time. The great Don Cheadle, again with the Cockney accent, and Ellen Barkin, she of the unconventional sexy looks, are both not used enough. And the bad guy? Well, everyone knows that a movie greatly benefits from a credible and worthy antagonist, and when this antagonist dares to put down Frank Sinatra, the deity of Las Vegas, well, then, you just know it's merely a matter of time before this guy enters a dimension of unmitigated misery and comeuppance. Accordingly, Al Pacino comes in full ruthless businessman regalia and delivers yet another strong and hissable performance. Meanwhie, character actor David Paymer is endlessly amusing as the pranked-upon hotel V.U.P. (Very Unimportant Person). Poor dude.<br /><br />Let's hearken back a bit. I absolutely loved the OCEAN'S ELEVEN remake, which I thought vastly improved on Sinatra and his rat pack's original. I even enjoyed OCEAN'S TWELVE, despite its rambling narrative and self-congratulatory reek. OCEAN'S THIRTEEN isn't as good as ELEVEN but is better and more focused than TWELVE. This isn't a bonafide thriller, of course, there's no real sense of jeopardy here. You know there'll be close scrapes but, no worries, everything'll come up roses for the good guys and go snake eyes for the villains. Director Steven Soderbergh again keeps the tone playful and breezy, the film propelled by hip, ritzy music and a plot that's constantly on the move. Yes, the movie ventures down a predictable and well traveled avenue, but enough plot complications are woven in that it remains interesting. As usual, the meticulously planned out scheme doesn't perfectly play out (it never does), and Ocean, Rusty, et al. must resolve upcropping obstacles on the fly: A Mexican factory which manufactures casino dice goes on strike (fomented, ironically, by one of the 13); the crew runs short of finances and must resort to enlisting the loathed Terry Benedict, who then demands that an impregnably guarded cache of diamonds be pilfered; and there's even a callback to a character in the first sequel. However, the most problematic dilemma may well be the artificial intelligence which is housed in Willie Bank's security system.<br /><br />I don't think we'll ever see the likes of Jack Black or Jon Heder as members of this sexy and glamourous crew. Clooney, Pitt, and Damon all belong to Hollywood's sleek and beautiful in-crowd, and OCEAN'S THIRTEEN, like the prior two films, exudes a pervading sense of "Hey, look at all of us looking pretty and being cool here." Affecting nonchalant poses, delivering lines with off-the-cuff verve, and engaging in celebrity inside jokes - there's a lot of that going around in the film. The sense of elbow nudging fun is very much alive as we see Matt Damon sporting a proboscis and attempting to down a drink, Clooney derisively rolling his eyes at Garcia (we've all seen the trailer), and Clooney and Pitt viewing an Oprah episode with moist eyes. I also liked Ocean's eventual revenge on/pay off to Terry Benedict. This series, when boiled to its essence, is just a bunch of boys (and girls) hanging out, goofing around, and enjoying each other's company. But, unlike TWELVE, I'm glad to note that the actors seem more invested into the story here, perhaps because, this time, there actually is a story. So, despite that feeling of having seen all this before, OCEAN'S THIRTEEN is eminently watchable and rates 2 snake eyes from me.</p></body></html>

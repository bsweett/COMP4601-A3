That giant fish proves to this day to be one of the most horrifying and successfully bone chilling creatures in movie history.  I stand by the belief that `Jaws' is one of the greatest movies ever made.  It has all the components of a good thriller and satisfies the moviegoer from start to finish.<br /><br />The plot is simple.  Amity Island is being terrorized by a great white shark.  The new police chief Martin Brody is working very hard, despite the contempt from the town's mayor, to keep the beaches empty and the body count minimal.  After some heavy persuasion and a few lost lives the mayor, Larry Vaughn, finally agrees to hire Quint, a shark hunter, to kill this great white.  Accompanying Quint on his hunt is Brody as well as shark expert Matt Hooper.  The film really takes a turn for the superb as these men soon realize that they are indeed being hunted by the shark.  The madness sets in slowly and the film's finale is jaw dropping.<br /><br />I think that everyone who has ever seen `Jaws' can attest to the fact that the opening sequence with young Chrissie Watkins decides to skinny dip in the dangerous waters stands alone as one of the most heart racing and all around gut wrenching scenes in motion picture history.  I was a young boy the first time I saw `Jaws' and for what felt like years I was unable to swim in the deep end of my pool, always fearing I'd be tugged under in the same manor as young Watkins was.  This is the reason that `Jaws' is a classic.  It stays with you.  Sure, the shark looks fake when we finally have the chance to see it full on, but to be completely honest it's not the shark that scared us in the first place.  It was the idea of the shark, the undeniable knowledge that he was on his way to devour you.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg is a masterful director and he turns out yet another brilliant picture in `Jaws'.  The mood created by the lighting, the music and the camera angles (I know the whole `shooting from the sharks perspective' was done on account of the mechanical shark being `out of order' half the time, but it was brilliant) helps terrify the audience.  While not technically a `horror' film, `Jaws' sends more chills, more realistic and meaningful chills, than many quote-unquote `horror' films that litter our cinemas today.<br /><br />The cast is all at the top of their games here.  Roy Scheider manages to make Martin Brody relatable and real to the audience, and Murray Hamilton captures the pompous selfishness surrounding Larry Vaughn perfectly.  It's Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss though who take the cake so-to-speak in regards to electric performances.  Shaw is magnificent as Quint and Dreyfuss breathes so much life into Hooper.  I just love Dreyfuss and this performance is yet another reason why.<br /><br />`Jaws' may not be your favorite film but there is no denying its powerful presence.  Anyone who has ever seen this film must admit that it had a huge impact on how they viewed a leisure swim.  And who can forget that commanding score.  I still hear that fear inspiring composition every time I get in the water.</p></body></html>

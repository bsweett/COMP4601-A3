<meta name="summary" content=""That woman deserves her revenge . . . and we deserve to die.""></head><body><p>Quentin Tarantino's "Kill Bill: Volume 2" suffers tremendously from overindulgence.  Less certainly would have been more with this particular film.<br /><br />The Bride (Uma Thurman) continues on her revenge-fueled quest by seeking out Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and Budd (Michael Madsen).  After disposing of them, she finally comes face-to-face with the target of her hatred - Bill (David Carradine).  However, the Bride's final confrontation with him is complicated when she learns that Bill has been keeping a very important secret from her.<br /><br />"Kill Bill: Volume 2" squeezes in as many pop culture references and homages as it can and the result is not pretty.  All this excess works against the film because it disrupts its pacing and overextends the dialogue so that certain exchanges seemingly go on forever.  Especially annoying is the psychoanalytic monologues that precede each life-and-death confrontation.  So flat and boring are the words that come out of the characters' mouths that it actually mutes the excitement of the subsequent action sequences.  "Kill Bill: Volume 2" would have worked much better if Tarantino did not try so hard to incorporate so many influences into his final cut.</p></body></html>

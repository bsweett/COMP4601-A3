<meta name="summary" content="A noteworthy remake of a landmark film."></head><body><p>Having already seen the orignal "The Manchurian Candidate" with all its avant-guard, 1960s style cinematography, I really had to temper my criticism for this film remake.  The original is a landmark film, a timely incarnation more appropriate for release at the center of the Cold War when brainwashing soldiers and/or government officials was not met with as much cynical skepticism as it is today.  Having said that, this remake is actually a surprisingly professional creation with director Jonathan Demme at the helm.  His best work remains "The Silence of the Lambs" and he continues with his penchant for close-up full frame shots of peoples faces speaking directly into the camera as if the audience as a whole comprised the character being spoken to.  He is a good director but all directors have their trademark signatures.  The entire cast shows up this time around, as well, each and every performance adding both texture and believability to their roles.  If I am pressed to point out any singular performance here it has to be that of Meryl Streep.  I will place a significant wager that she will receive yet another Oscar nomination for her reprise of the now infamous Angela Lansbury performance of a conniving, power hungry, manipulative Arch Angel protectorate who will see her son reach the height of political power at any cost.  She has many outstanding moments.  But all the paranoid intrigue this story invokes is not all that amazing now at the heart of the Information Age as it was during the Cold War.  If you have not seen the original then this film might seem inspired, albeit sometimes incredible to entertain.  My advice is to compare the original version with the one here then buy the one you prefer.  The original version is oftentimes mesmerizing and highly inventive, while this updated version is professional and caters to a more modern audience.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Graphic Experience"></head><body><p>BRAVEHEART is a lavish production. It depicts medieval warfare fairly accurately in all its bloody glory. Moreover, William Wallace was a real-life Scottish folk-hero. On the other hand, the events shown here have little relation to actual historical events and the graphic bloodiness is almost overwhelming. The end is a visual tribute to man's creativity in finding ways to inflict ghastly physical pain on his fellow man. I watched this once, found it quite interesting, and have no desire to repeat the experience. As a cinematic effort, though, it is beautifully done. If you like lots of blood and gore, you'll love this movie. If not, steer clear.</p></body></html>

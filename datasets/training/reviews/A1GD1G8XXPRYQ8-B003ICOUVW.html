<meta name="summary" content="I expected worse, but well done!"></head><body><p>I was afraid to buy this movie. I expected it to be bad and even worse, terrible. But in fact it was good. I liked that it was almost 2 hours of the movie, that way I felt the story didn't lack nothing. What I disliked, was the cast for the movie. I didn't like none of the characters. And what was cool, is that the movie is done in old fashion. And atmosphere for the movie is really great. What was too much, is some scenes where the main character was dreaming, but thought he was awake and suddenly a werewolf appears, then again and again and so quite a few times through half of the movie. All those hallucinations he had were not necessary to show. And of course all the old curses stories of the Hollywood and silver bullets. I didn't like how they made werewolves, but again it's like an old movie remake. And it was pretty original. So I don't love it, but I liked it.</p></body></html>

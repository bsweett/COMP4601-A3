Mel Gibson's (known for directing "The Passion Of The Christ" (2004) & "Braveheart" (1995), for which he won an Best Director Oscar) directing is excellent! This is one of the best films of the year. The story and screenplay by Gibson & Farhad Safinia is excellent. The performances by two unknowns, Rudy Youngblood & Dalia Hernandez, are excellent. The music by James Horner (won the Oscar for his work for Best Original Score for "Titanic" (1997) is excellent. The cinematography by Dean Semler (who also did the cinematography to "We Were Soldiers" (2002), a movie Gibson starred in & also won the Oscar for his work on Kevin Costner's "Dances With Wolves" (1990) is excellent. The film editing by Kevin Stitt (who also did 3 movies that Gibson starred in, "Payback", "Lethal Weapon 4" (1998) & "Conspiracy Theory" (1997) & John Wright (who also film edited "The Passion Of The Christ") is excellent. The casting by Carla Hool is excellent. The production design by Thomas E. Sanders (who also did "Braveheart", "We Were Soldiers" & "Maverick" (1994), another film that Gibson starred in) is excellent. The art direction by Roberto Bonelli is excellent. The costume design by Mayes C. Rubeo is excellent. This is another bloody epic from the vision and the mind of Mel Gibson, but it is another excellent epic from the vision and the mind of Mel Gibson, who doesn't stop to amaze the audience. This is a visually sweeping epic that doesn't know when to quit.</p></body></html>

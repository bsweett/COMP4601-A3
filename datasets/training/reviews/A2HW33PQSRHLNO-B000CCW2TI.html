<meta name="summary" content="Worth it for Cillian Murphy"></head><body><p>On the whole, this is the type of movie that falls somewhere between being mediocre and really bad.  It has a few moments (an unmistakable product of the now common "the trailer was better than the film itself" phenomenon that Hollywood execs skillfully employ to keep raking in the bucks), but it is worth a full watch just for the performance of Cillian Murphy, who may be our next Christopher Walken if he makes the right career decisions.  So far his talent has been wasted on self-addressed directorial loveletters like Sandra Bullock's "Murder By Numbers" and  pointless spots in crapfests like "The Village", but it seems he is smartening up: his performance as Scarecrow in "Batman Begins" left no doubt as to his psychopathic potential.<br /><br />He almost saves this bungled psychodrama which degenerates into an unredeemable mess after his character Jackson Rippner (gee, wonder who that's a reference to Wes) boards the plane with the stomach churningly "heroic" Rachel McAdams.  Her character was so sweet, so together, so plain wonderful that I wanted to throw up.  But even his shark-eyed charisma can't bear the weight of the script and Craven's insistence on always being goofy.  I wonder if he's aware of this or not: he has become such a joke that maybe he knows no one will ever take him seriously again, hence the self-degradation-via-failed-camp in movie after movie.<br /><br />That said, Murphy running around like the velvet menace with the hole in his throat and an unstoppable fury makes it worth enduring.  This is an odd Irishman with a lot of potential for being an actor we won't forget, if he sticks with films like "Begins" and "28 Days Later".  Rent it and get a look at this blossoming, scary new talent.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I was dragged to the theatre for this one, but not bad!"></head><body><p>I thought fer-sure this was going to be yet another stupid (kinda) sci-fi or horror movie that turns out to be all in the main character's mind. Mulholland Dr., Secret Window, etc.. BUT, that's not the case here, as you discover pretty early on in the movie. When the NSA shows up, you know there's something to it -but what?? This movie definitely falls into the catagory of good sci-fi/drama/mystery, yet did'nt spend a zillion dollars to make it, and it still has a great story and delivers entertainment.<br /><br />It's pretty good, and people's claims that they actually jumped in their seats a few times, are not exaggerated.<br /><br />There's not much in the theatre's right now either(10-18-04), so pickins are slim anyway. Enjoy.</p></body></html>

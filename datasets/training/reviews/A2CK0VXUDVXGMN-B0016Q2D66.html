<meta name="summary" content="Mature and Complicated Film - About our Ilusions"></head><body><p>As a fan of Ernest Becker, and The Human Manifesto:  A General Plan For Human Survival, by Vincent Scarsella, this movie had marked overtones from the theories of Becker - that we all are trapped in illusions of meaning programmed into our souls by the cultures in which we live.  Mrs. Wheeler, played so convincingly by Kate Winslet, seeks escape from her illusion, and finds only submission and death.  Mr. Wheeler, played equally convincingly by DeCaprio (who is under-rated, I think, as a superb American actor of our age, perhaps the finest), finds only submission.  This is a very grown-up, complicated Beckerian movie - but, alas, a movie which does not have Beckerian overtones is nothing but fluff.</p></body></html>

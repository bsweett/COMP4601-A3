The film moves at a steady pace, has some charming comedic moments, and is overall enjoyable. Won't give the story away, but I do recommend this film for it's light hearted comedy and excellent performances. Tea Leoni is quite exceptional, and Penelope Cruz look-a-like Paz Vega shows promise as an up and comer. Sandler has some funny moments as well, but his role is less comedy and more dramatic. The children in this film are also quite talented young actors, with special mention going to Shelbie Bruce (Christina) & Sarah Steele (Bernice) for their heartfelt performances. Cloris Leachman is quite funny as the mother Evelyn Norwich. While Vega is enjoyable and quite convincing as Flor Moreno, this is really Tea Leoni's film. She pretty much steals the show as neurotic, newly minted housewife Deborah Clasky. It's becomes quite clear while watching, that she really threw herself into the role.<br /><br />Check it out if you get a chance! Probably a better rental than an addition to your DVD collection, however, as with all reviews....that is just a matter of my personal opinion. ;-)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ultra-violent brilliance."></head><body><p>It's hard to believe that this movie was released in 1971, for it's almost as powerful today.  And like most Kubrick films, this brutally cold satire isn't for everyone.<p>Kubrick has a knack of showing the world violence in  a way that makes us pause, makes us think, much like Sam Peckinpaw did in  the classic "The Wild Bunch".  The audience is confronted with one brutal  image after another, revealing the insanity of it all.  And much like  Kubrick's "Barry Lyndon", we have a cold-hearted hero? that we quickly come  to despise.  Yet, by the time the film winds down to its closing, our  feelings for this vile lad has changed.  But Kubrick doesn't let Alex off  the hook, nor society, nor the viewer.<p>Kudos to Malcom McDowell who  played Alex, the anti-social leader of a bunch of misfits.  His performance  was second to none.  Between 1 and 10, "A Clockwork Orange" gets a solid 9,  even today.</p></body></html>

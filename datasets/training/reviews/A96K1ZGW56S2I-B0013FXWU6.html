<meta name="summary" content="Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow."></head><body><p>Loosely based upon the novel OIL by Upton Sinclair, writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson takes a portion of Sinclair's original story and makes it his own in THERE WILL BE BLOOD, a movie about greed, oil, power, and duplicity.  THERE WILL BE BLOOD follows the life of Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis).  For the first fifteen minutes of the movie, not a word is spoken.  The audience watches as Plainview seems to be mining for gold, but is instead ultimately looking for oil.  He slowly continues digging for black gold, eventually pulling it out from the ground one bucket at the time.  Time progresses and a small crew is added.  Tragedy strikes the crew and the baby of one of the workers is left orphaned.  Plainview takes the child and adopts the boy as his own to use as a prop as he travels across the country asking people to let him mine their oil for them.<br /><br />Years later in 1911, Plainview is approached by a young man named Paul Sunday (Paul Dano).  Sunday is from a small community called Little Boston and he tells Plainview that there is so much oil in his hometown that it seeps out of the ground when it rains.  In exchange for some money, he shows Plainview the location of the land and disappears from the story.  Plainview and H.W.(Dillon Freasier), his son, investigate the land and discover that what Paul said was indeed true.  Without mentioning Paul, Plainview befriends the Sunday family and impresses upon them what he wants to do and how important it is.  At first the family isn't impressed, particularly Paul's twin brother Eli (Dano), but after listening to Plainview's eloquent speech and being satisfied that the new industry will benefit not only the town but Eli's church, the family agrees and promises to get the other townspeople together for a meeting.  As the drilling for the oil commences, so, too, does the power struggle between Eli and Daniel.  They both are greedy and hunger for power, but use very different means and arenas to obtain it.<br /><br />The final portion of the film fastforwards to 1927, allows the audience to see what has become of the majors characters, and gives the story an incomplete coda.  Daniel is wealthy beyond one's imagination, but is so eaten up by suspicion, hatred, and greed that he disowns H.W.  Meanwhile, Eli has become an internationally known preacher, but has almost become as corrupt as Daniel.<br /><br />The acting in THERE WILL BE BLOOD is astonishing.  Daniel Day-Lewis is at the top of his game, which is saying a lot for a man who sometimes takes years to study for a role and immerse himself into the character.  Day-Lewis offered the strongest performance of the year and well deserved the Best Actor Oscar he received.  Paul Dano also gives a wonderful performance, and even though he was overlooked by the Academy, he should have at least been nominated for a Supporting Actor award.  Day-Lewis had over a year to study for his role, but Dano was cast as Eli Sunday after shooting on the film had already begun.<br /><br />Another component of THERE WILL BE BLOOD that I really enjoyed was the score by Johnny Greenwood.  The music in the film is full of dissonance, which reflects the inner turmoil of the characters beneath the cool exteriors and posing relationships they have with each other.  The music screeches and shrieks, yet like the Sirens' call there is something mysteriously enchanting about it.<br /><br />THERE WILL BE BLOOD is a dark and sometimes disturbing drama about greed, power, duplicity, and ultimately murder.  Cinematically the film is comparable the CITIZEN KANE, but the two movies are very different.  KANE offers the story of a man corrupted by power who had some redeeming characteristics, but THERE WILL BE BLOOD follows the story of a man consumed by evil with no redeeming characteristics.  I am reminded of Macbeth and the story told by an idiot full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.  Though it might not signify anything, even an idiotic story can be an entertaining one.</p></body></html>

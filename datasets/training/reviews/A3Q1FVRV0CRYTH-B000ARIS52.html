I wanted to say that this movie, although not AMAZING as some would think, was actually really really good for what it was.  I walked into this movie with different expectations, not to say that my expectations were better, just different.  I've never read the comics and maybe thats why it was so weird for me, but it stayed true to comic style in writing and camera shot.  Because of the comic style dialog it comes across quite corny.  That aside, you have to look at this film with different eyes.  Your not watching a film, your watching art.  And I might say, Rodriguez paints one amazing picture.  The imagry, the omage to Miller, the tribute to the comic was really amazing.  As I said, I've never read the comics, but after seeing the movie I picked up a few at the bookstore and flipped through, and I might have to say that Rodriguez did Miller proud.  The plot is full of twists and turns, small subplots that interwine together all involving strippers, hookers, canibals and pedophiles.  The first story revolves around Marv whos been set up by canibals to take the fall for the murder of a hooker.  He sets out to find her killer and ends up taking the rap for it in the end.  The second revolves around (Clive Owen) who is defending his girlfreind from her abusive x and starts a war between the hookers and the cops.  The last revolves around Hartigan (Bruce Willis)who in the opening saves a girl from being raped by a pedophile and is shot (what apears like to death) but we see is really hospitalized.  Things happen and 8 years pass and he now has the chance to save the now grown up stripper (played by Jessica Alba) from the pedophile again.  The plot is really moot compaired to the briliant way the film is shot.  The violence is brutal and relentless, but since 90% is done in black and white it really isn't as graphic as it could be and for all you horny men out there who are vying to see Jessica Alba naked...she doesn't!  The film is really a hodgepodge of scenes and to be quite frank after walking out it took me a while to rememeber what happened to whom.  Don't go for the acting, don't go for the story, go for Roberts art...and you'll be happy you did.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="There's a reason they made sequels."></head><body><p>This is the original, written by David Morell, only slightly altered. It's a wonderful story. Yes, when you think of Rambo you think of the [stuff] they piled on after; but there's a reason they made them... and that's because this movie is powerful and excellent. I was skeptical, but after watching this movie I have to admit that Sylvester Stalone is a much better actor than I ever gave him credit for. I always dismissed him as a beefcake not-much-dialog tough guy; this movie... well, it doesn't break that mold, but it shows you a bit more depth than you might imagine. <p>I read the book years ago and was deeply moved; David Morell is a terrific author. This is the first time I've seen the movie, but I'm very glad to have it on DVD and I'll easily be able to  watch it again.</p></body></html>

The terrorist bombing of the Aramco compound in Saudi Arabia is certainly timely and plausible. The film opens with little documentary on the history of Aramco which sets the tone, but the history scene is without content, as is the film. The compound is bombed, but there is never any clear point made about who the bombers are or why they have targeted these residents. Instead the film focuses on issues of jurisdiction and bureaucracy, which could be made interesting, but here too we get nothing substantive. Every set-up simply pits one of the pugnacious FBI agents against his hapless guard who is attempting to carry out his duties. The American wants to be made an exception to every rule, seemingly in each instance totally ignorant of why rules exist or what customs are. The female agent, for example, insists on running around around in a tight t-shirt, as though she were too stupid to notice that every other woman in the country wears traditional garb. If you don't understand at the beginning of the film why the Saudis may want Americans out of the country, you certainly do at the end, although I don't think this is the film's intended message. The actors do a fine job of playing obnoxious, clueless cretins with a talent for forensics. Beyond that I see no differentiation in the acting. When the shooting starts, only the Saudis get killed, although the picture opens with lots of innocent Americans dying. There is lots of lashing out, temper tantrums, terribly crude language, which the Saudis rightly ask be curtailed, but in the end nothing whatever has been resolved. This is a classic of much ado about nothing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="To Adapt Is To Survive: The British Monarchy in Crisis."></head><body><p>"The Queen" chronicles the behind-the-scenes drama of the British royal family in the week following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales on the 30th of August 1997. Princess Diana' death plunges the monarchy into an unexpected crisis when public grief overflows into the streets and parks. Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) considers Diana's death a private affair and can't fathom her people's need for a public funeral or acknowledgement from the royal family: "The less attention one draws to it, the better." Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), elected head of the government by a landslide just a few months before, understands what the public expects and the dangers of the monarchy not fulfilling that role: "Will someone please save these people from themselves?" So he advises, pleads, and cajoles the Queen into making a public tribute in the face of growing anti-monarchist sentiment.<br /><br />Helen Mirren won an Oscar for her portrayal of this monarch who keeps her feelings so much to herself that people tend to doubt that she has feelings. I'm not convinced myself, but "The Queen" offers an interesting perspective on Her Majesty's stoicism: Duty precludes her from ever being partial. She can't even vote. And she despised Princess Diana -with good reason- so was probably not anguished by her death. In presenting Diana's death from the perspective of the royal family, secluded at Balmoral Castle, the film tries to make the Queen a sympathetic figure, a bastion of traditional culture suddenly confronted with a celebrity culture that she does not understand. This does little in my mind to alleviate the fact that Queen Elizabeth II utterly lacks leadership skills, charisma, and is so uncomprehending of her own culture that she erodes the usefulness of the monarchy. But I have to admit that she -or her verisimilitude- is fascinating to watch.<br /><br />We also see the perspective of Tony Blair and his staff at 10 Downing Street on Princess Diana's death and that of the British public, who are represented by real television news footage. In fact, everyone is experiencing the crisis through television. The royals, the government, and the public spend a lot of time watching each other on TV. It's difficult to know where director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan's sympathies lie, if anywhere. The events of "The Queen" resulted from the clash of three dysfunctional parties, though the film does not explicitly say so: mentally ill Princess Diana, emotionally stunted and out-of-touch Queen Elizabeth II, and the British people whose initial expressions of affection and grief quickly degenerated into an obscene display of self-pity.<br /><br />If you're wondering how screenwriter Stephen Marber knew what happened behind closed doors in the days following Princess Diana's death, he drew on his own sources inside 10 Downing Street and those of historian Robert Lacey inside Balmoral Castle. Mr. Lacey wrote the book "Majesty" about the reign of Elizabeth II and served as consultant on this film. Beside the obvious inability to know the precise content of private conversations, some liberties have been taken with the story, including the subplot involving the stag at Balmoral, which serves as metaphor. And a wonderful metaphor it is. "The Queen" is a sublimely insightful film that possesses more gravity than any of its dramatis personae would seem to merit alone.<br /><br />The DVD (Miramax 2007): There are a making-of documentary and 2 audio commentaries. "The Making of The Queen" (18 min) has 3 parts: the cast, director Stephen Frears, and other crew discuss the challenges of portraying real people; the environments of the film as created through production and costume designs; and crew members talk about their experiences of the week that Princess Diana died. The first audio commentary by director Stephen Frears and screenwriter Peter Morgan is sporadic and addresses a miscellany of topics without being informative. Skip it. The second audio commentary by historian Robert Lacey is excellent and very worthwhile if you enjoyed the film. Lacey discusses the film's themes of traditional vs celebrity culture and the perspective of the royals vs the public. He explains the context of events and the meaning of protocols. He tells us what is and is not based on fact as far as it could be ascertained, takes us through the actions of the characters, and explains the politics for us foreigners. Subtitles are available in English SDH, Spanish. Dubbing available in Spanish.</p></body></html>

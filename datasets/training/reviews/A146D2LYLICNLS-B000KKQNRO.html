<meta name="summary" content="Movie adaptations don't always have to be worse than the book"></head><body><p>I'll begin by saying that with the exception of "Splash" I've never liked Ron Howard's films. While I admit that he's certainly a competent filmmaker, his movies are just too for-the-masses, formulaic and safe for my movie-viewing interests. But I went to see "The Da Vinci Code" anyway, mainly because I enjoyed the book (even though I think it's rather hollow and not the superior literary work so many say it is). And much to my surprise, I ended up really liking this adaptation. I think Howard has done a highly commendable job with transferring the book to the big screen. On the one hand, it wasn't an easy task, as so much takes place in the book in such a short amount of time. But on the other hand, it *was* an easy task, as the book reads like a movie script to begin with (we have to admit that). So in a way Howard already had all the pieces he needed (including most of the dialog); his job was simply to put them all together and create the finished product. But I'll reiterate that all in all I think he did a good job with it.<br /><br />This movie basically follows the book almost note-for-note, which some will argue is its strong point whereas others will argue the total opposite. I tend to go with it being a strong point. Howard never intended to reinvent the story nor add his own vision to it. It's as if he directed it through Dan Brown's eyes. Changing the story would have caused more uproar than the uproar caused simply by the movie being made in the first place. And changing the story would not have attracted Da Vinci Code-haters to the theaters. Simply put, this movie was made for fans of the book and nobody else. I've heard many people say that the movie is shallow. Well, so is the book. You take an average-looking person and stand them in front of a mirror and the person in the mirror looking back at them isn't going to be beautiful.<br /><br />Performance-wise, I have no complaints, although I found Jean Reno's portrayal of Fache to be extremely over-the-top and overdone. IMO Paul Bettany stole the show as Silas, even if they forgot to give him red contact lenses. Audrey Tautou was perfect as Sophie (and by the way, she can decipher MY code any day, and would quickly see that it spells out L-O-V-E). And of course, Tom Hanks as Langdon. Sure, there are other actors who could have taken on the role just as well. But Hanks does more than a competent job.<br /><br />Howard does make a handful of minor changes, although none compromise the story in any way. For example, he changes the way Silas attacks Langdon at Teabing's home. But one change I'd like to mention, a change that I feel benefited the movie a great deal, is Howard's decision not to have Langdon and Sophie hook up at the end. One thing about the book I hated was the hackeyed, almost obligatory and forced eventual hook-up of those two. Although Langdon and Sophie hint at a possible attraction in the movie, it doesn't go beyond that.<br /><br />I'll end by saying that this movie adaptation easily equals, if not slightly exceeds, the book. Again, if you thought this adaptation was hollow, read the book again and see that it's not that much different. So, I give this film 4 stars based on its own merits, but also based on Howard's successful transfer of the book into a visual medium without trying to outdo it. Take away from it what you will.</p></body></html>

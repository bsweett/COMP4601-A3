<meta name="summary" content="The thrills are alive with the sound of music."></head><body><p>This is my favorite of all the TNG movies and to me second only to Wrath of Khan among all the feature films.<br /><br />It's not very cerebral stuff, but the story is continually moved along by action, adventure, beautiful special effects, humor (including the painful to watch "star trek" line) and most of all a brilliant soundrack.  This is the kind of soundtrack where you can just crank up the soundtrack CD (which I own) and enjoy it as a piece of music without even seeing the movie.<br /><br />Top it off with a moving tribute to Jerry Goldsmith and a wealth of other bonuses that I haven't even got around to watching yet.  This is a Trek movie that you don't have to be a Trekkie to enjoy.</p></body></html>

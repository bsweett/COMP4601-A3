Although an interesting script, co-penned with Nolan's brother, John Nolan, (Whose short story inspired the film Memento) lacked in character development and is plot driven to the point that insignificant literary devices are used to justify motivation and therefore comes off as unbelievable.<br /><br />Two 19th century magicians begin a deadly rivalry over an undisclosed span of time that becomes all-consuming for each of them. The reason for this rivalry is a revenge for the death of Hugh Jackman's characters wife who dies while performing a dangerous trick. Christian Bale's character mistakenly or not, ties the wrong knot around the woman's wrists, instigating her failure to escape from the water tank, resulting in her death. There is no motivation for the Bale character to intently kill her, as he cannot remember why he knotted the rope in a particular way. This "mistake" is enough to set the Jackman character on a life time obsession to kill or exact revenge on the other magician. The unintentional knot, to my mind, came across as a weak literary device to ensure the plot drives forward.<br /><br />The cast is certainly impressive from Jackman, Bail and a small part played by David Bowie.<br /><br />Art direction and cinematography in this film are excellent, as a period piece it was realistic down to the smallest detail.<br /><br />All the performances were first rate except for a few scenes that felt to be a little clunky, obviously needing more rehearsal time.<br /><br />Overall the film felt to be rushed, certain scenes unnecessary and others that should not have made the final cut.<br /><br />The ending of the film is surprising though leaned towards the absurd, suddenly turning a thriller into a Science Fiction piece.<br /><br />The Prestige is well worth a look at, one of those films that will appeal to a certain audience, while leaving others wondering what all the hype was about.<br /><br />3.5 stars.</p></body></html>

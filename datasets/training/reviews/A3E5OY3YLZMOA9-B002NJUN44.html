The film is about a young teen farmer who lives in a land controlled by an evil king named Galbatorix (John Malkovich). The story goes that there was a time when men and dragons fought together and Galbatorix betrayed his people and killed all the dragons and most of their riders. Now an unborn dragon named Saphira falls into the hands of young Eragon. The two are destined for each other to take out Galbatorix. So this is not one of my more skilled synopses but this movie is not really hard to sum up.<br /><br />Ok I didn't hear of Eragon until I saw the preview for this film. I never heard of the book or anything. I have no idea why I pay any attention to trailers cause most of the time they seriously make the good films look bad and the bad films look good. Eragon looked like a decent film and I expected a lot of it. This is one weird movie because it had everything it needed to be great. It had the what I'm told a great book to go by so the story was a piece of cake. It had the money so the cinematography was no problem and the CGI looked incredibly realistic. And it also had actors, so where could this movie mess up? Well for one the script to me had no heart, no feeling. You can tell when it's the actors or the writing and I'm sure it was the writing. I mean Jeremy Irons is no amateur at these types of films. Rachel Weisz was a nice fit playing the voice of Saphira and did a great job. She was the only one that had a couple of good scenes where you could feel her and she was a computer-generated dragon.<br /><br />The battles were awful and the sound quality of the battle made it worst. I've heard more sword clashing on an episode of Rachel Ray's cooking show. Some say the film was slow but to me it went too fast and just organized badly altogether. There was no suspense building up to the final battle either. If anything good came out of Eragon it was the cinematography and the base of the story itself was interesting. If there is a sequel which I'm sure there will be because this movie did well at the box office I would be tempted to see it hoping someone reads all the bad reviews and fixes the mistakes. To be honest this story has a lot to work with and the next film can be saved. I'd say save Eragon for your child or young niece or nephew who will just be fascinated by the dragon but leave some room for hope that the second will be better.</p></body></html>

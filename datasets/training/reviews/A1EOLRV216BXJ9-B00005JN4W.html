What is more ..."></head><body><p>Apart from the stunning CG - facial expression, light composition, fluid movements, graphic design ... etc, The Incredibles sets itself apart with its detailed plot and the meticulously crafted personalities of the main characters. While the young audience will be pleased with the action sequences and sound, the story strikes a deep chord with the middle aged Moms and Dads.<br /><br />This is the comic version of Parenthood, Desperate Housewives, Cosby Show, Eight is Enough all mixed together. Every few minutes, real family issues come up and make The Incredibles family so genuinely human. 2 scenes particularly appealed to me - (1)Dad landed on a luscious green island to rescue the world. He wanted to flex his superhero muscles and make a sprint, only to find his body failed him.  (2)Mom and the 2 kids, nearly drowned in the sea, pulled themselves together and speeded to the island to save Dad.<br /><br />As entertaining as you can get, this is definitely a must-watch family movie. What's more, it is a piece of art and chicken soup for the adults. The bonus features contain alternate opening scenes, story boards and what a feat the production team had pulled off! Simply awesome.</p></body></html>

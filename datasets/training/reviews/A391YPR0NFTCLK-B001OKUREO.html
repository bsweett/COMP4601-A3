<meta name="summary" content="regardless, its an interesting film"></head><body><p>i really enjoyed this movie. its well directed and the ensemble cast is uniformly excellent. while the movie works as fine docudrama about the events that made Bush who he is, it also works as a biting satire on the sheer stupidity of our government's decision making process. while the film is not without its flaws, mainly, the pacing and lack of a crystal clear focus, this is an excellent film which needs to be seen for Josh Brolin's performance alone. Oliver Stone is getting his career back on track.</p></body></html>

If you have, then you will still like film!"></head><body><p>I saw the orginal Los Angeles production with Jennifer Holliday.  It was rightfully described as a living film.  Every scene flowed into the next, no blackouts.  Add to that a brilliant book and score with sets, costumes and lighting to match, you have an incredible experience.<br /><br />When I heard that Bill Condon (who adapted the screenplay of Chicago)was writing and directing, I was happy.  Too many musical transfers have been ruined by putting them in the hands of directors who have never had any musical experience (John Huston & Annie and Richard Attenburough & A Chrous Line). But unfortunately, it just proves how great a director Rob Marshall is.<br /><br />Dreamgirls is about family, fame and how the American public rewards beauty over talent.  The film forgets this and trys to be about the Motown experience and doesn't accomplish this.<br /><br />The Dreamette are three friends that dream of fame as a girl group.  Effie is the lead singer of the group and her brother CC writes the songs.  The girls go to a local talent competition and meet promoter Curtis Taylor. He immediately sees the girl's potential.  To get them started he makes them the back up singer for fading star James "Thunder" Early.<br /><br />When it is time for the Dreamettes to breakaway to become The Dreams, Curtis moves the beautiful Deena to be the lead and makes the more talented Effie step to backup.  This creates an on going conflict between the two divas.<br /><br />Eventually, Effie is replaced and the Dreams becomes supertars.  Effie eventually rebuilds her career with the help of her old manager. (To me the best moment is Jennifer singing "I'm Changing")  CC eventually realizes that Curtis only concern is the bottom line and goes back to Effie to help her comeback.<br /><br />This sets up a final battle between Effie and Curtis when Curtis wants CC's new song for The Dreams to lauch Disco.  This leads to the great scene where CC puts it all on the line.  In the end, everyone sees Curtis for what he is and all the Dreams reunite for one last time.<br /><br />Add to this basic storyline, riots, assinations, and drugs and you have the movie.<br /><br />Part of the problem is that Condon wanted to make this an issue film instead a of a slice of entertainment history.  The other problem is that he does not trust the musical forum.<br /><br />There are a number of occasions where he omitted the intro of a song (sometimes he would use the lyrics spoken!) and other times use the intro??  The best example is in Cadillac Car.  In  the musical, the intro to the song talks about how different groups of used ownership of Cadillac Cars to prove that they were equal to the White upper class.<br /><br />People say that musicals are impractical because people don't break out in song in real life. Well 90% of all films have characters doing improbable things. But most people will see a film if it is done well, people don't care!<br /><br />One final thing is that Condon reduced all characters to supporting roles there were really no leading performaces, this is a ensemble movie.  (I don't really know if this is a positive or negative.)<br /><br />When Ann Reinking revived Chicago, I told people that if they never saw Bob Fosse's original production with Chita, Gwen and Jerry, then see the new show and you will love it. But if you had, don't expect the new production to be as good.  That is what I say of this film.  You will still like the film but the stage production was definitely superior.</p></body></html>

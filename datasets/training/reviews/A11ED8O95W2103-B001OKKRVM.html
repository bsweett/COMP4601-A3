<meta name="summary" content="I'll never laugh at a penguin again.  Everyone should see this."></head><body><p>It just goes to show how some of our preconceived notions of anything can be totally wrong.<br /><br />Before seeing this movie, I thought penguins lived a life of goofy fun jumping off the ice into the water and out of the water back onto the ice.  Watching them waddle around on land was great slapstick comedy.<br /><br />Well, perhaps the reason why that's all I ever thought of penguins was because that's all the footage there was.  Nobody up until now wanted to live with them for an extended period of time to see and record the harsh realities of penguin life.  After all, it took a lot of work and sacrifice (and some serious money for sure) and some genuine risk to life and limb (due to frostbite) to get this story on film.<br /><br />(What a far cry from some of the cheaply produced politically oriented documentaries I've recently seen that have one subject person on camera kicked back in a chair while the cameras roll and a mysterious echo-voice speaks in the backgound because the film maker didn't want to invest in another microphone.)<br /><br />Yes, it may be true that the narrative goes too far in anthropomorphizing the penguins, but I believe it's also true that if all we humans showed the same determination, courage, and loyalty as these birds do, the world would be a much better place.  Whether driven by instinct or love or both, and whether they evolved this way or are a product of intelligent design, these penguins are an example to us all.  That's the point of the documentary.<br /><br />The narrative by Morgan Freeman left me cold (sorry).  It was acceptable but to me neither added nor detracted from the story told on film.  There were some hokey narrative moments, like when the narration says that the dying penguins "dissappear". That was weird.  Come to mention it, given the temperatures wouldn't a dead penguine immeidately freeze solid?  What would eat them?  How come there aren't thousands of penguin corpses littering the migration route and the breeding grounds?  I guess it doesn't pay to think too much sometimes.<br /><br />I gave this DVD five stars despite some of this hokey stuff because the flaws that some may percieve in this documentary do little to detract from the beauty, the story, or the committment shown by the film makers.  They are nits, and can't keep you from enjoying this film unless you let them.<br /><br />Also, there is a documentary about making the documentary which is in and of itself an amazing story and added alot to the DVD as a product.<br /><br />So, next time I see film clips of penguins jumping in and out of the water and waddling around, I won't laugh.  This is what penguins do on their Summer vacation, a vacation that is richly deserved considering the other nine months of their lives is a cold, freezing, hellish ordeal of survival.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A fable where the ironies are as pungent as the aromas"></head><body><p>"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer" is one of those films that begins pretty much at the start of the end.  Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) is beaten and dragged from his prison cell to hear the sentence of the court, which seems to have a viciousness usually reserved for regicides.  This beginning makes it clear that the murderer whose story this is will be caught.  Such a statement is true, but it is also inaccurate when it comes to capturing the nature of this 2006 film directed by Tom Tykwer ("<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKN2">Heaven</a>") based on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375725849">novel</a> by Patrick S&uuml;skind.  Ultimately, I found myself thinking that this story is a fable.<br /><br />The history of perfume begins in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, with the name of a perfume maker appearing on a second millennium cuneiform tablet.  In the 18th century France became the center of the European perfume trade when aromatic plants grown in the Grasse region provided the raw materials for the flourishing industry.  However, S&uuml;skind's novel finds the motivation for perfume in the muck and mire that was the streets of Paris three centuries ago and even without the use of scratch-and-sniff stickers Tykwer's movie gives a sense that the city is one giant cesspool where perfumes are a necessary way of covering the smells.  Grenouille is literally born in the muck and manages to survive, growing up to evince two remarkable traits: Not only does he posses the most acute sense of smell on the planet but also has absolutely no scent of his own.<br /><br />Grenouille's unique talent leads to a peculiar obsession when he encounters two people.  One is a girl (Karoline Herfurth) who sells plums on those streets of Paris and the other is Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), a master perfumer who has fallen out of favor and now resorts to trying to copy the successful perfumes of his competitors.  Grenouille wants to preserve the smell of the plum girl and it is in the service of that obsession that he becomes a murderer.  Baldini agrees to mentor the young tanner in exchange for marvelous new perfumes, but the old master does not have the secret that drives Grenouille and in parting Baldini tells the young man to head to Grasse, the center of the world for the art of perfuming.  However, once there what catches Grenouille's attention are not the plants of the region but the young women of Grasse, especially the beautiful Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood), daughter of Antoine Richis (Alan Rickman), a wealthy and well-respected citizen of the town.<br /><br />John Hurt's narration is a major part of the film since Grenouille is a man of very few words who spends most of his time sniffing the air and inhaling deeply the scents that catch his attention.  The narration is also needed to ensure the audience catches the attendant ironies of the story's conclusion.  It is Hurt's tone as much as his words that confirm my idea that this story is a fable.  Except for the layers of irony at the end I might be tempted to call "Perfume" a parable, but the uniqueness of both Grenouille's character and his story are such that it cannot be extrapolated to the audience in any meaningful way.  There is no catharsis to be found here and none is intended, but "Perfume" is very much in the tradition of the tragic heroes of ancient Greece where the Fates often dictated an ironic demise.  As such, it will not be to everybody's taste, but then that is not the primary sense at play in this partiucular tale.</p></body></html>

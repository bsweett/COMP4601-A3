Put Leonardo DiCaprio together with Kate Winslet and would it not be reasonable to expect something romantic?  Nothing could be further from the truth.  "Revolutionary Road" is often confronting.  It deals with tough themes within an unsettled marriage.  It is anything but romantic.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Richard Yates, "Revolutionary Road" is set in 1950s Connecticut.  Frank Wheeler (DiCaprio) is a young company man trying to make a way ahead for his wife and two kids.  He works for the same company that previously employed his father in New York.  He is bored.  However, his wife, April (Winslet) is beyond boredom.  She is quite depressed and hates her lifestyle.  This is unfortunate as her lifestyle would be the envy of so many people.  The family is well off and there are two happy children.<br /><br />It is the interaction of husband and wife that forms the basis of the film.  At times, this can be extremely discomforting to the viewer.  Yet it always seems plausible.  The characters have cred.  The film's ending is also traumatic.  Don't go looking for a happy reconciliation between husband and wife.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the film's troubling theme, "Revolutionary Road" is worth the effort.  The viewer is rewarded with a gritty insight to a dysfunctional family.  Both DiCaprio and Winslet are excellent in their roles.</p></body></html>

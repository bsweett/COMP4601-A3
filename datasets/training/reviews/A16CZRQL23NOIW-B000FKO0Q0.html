<meta name="summary" content="Just a memorable fiction thriller?"></head><body><p>It has been said that frequently the reality overpasses the fiction. And this is precisely, the point of departure for this intriguing film, deeply enrooted in the Noir Film grounds. During his absence the wife of Dr. Kimble is being murdered, he arrives to crime scene and fights daringly with the one arm assassin but there is nothing to do. Desperately he makes all what you must not do, leaving his fingerprints around every corner of the room. The killer disappears and obviously he seems to be the main suspect.<br /><br />The train accident is by far one of the most electrifying sequences in the cinema story, magnificently gotten by the Special Effects Team. This twist of fate allows him to escape to prove his innocence.  But the Lieutenant Gerard admirably played by Tommy Lee Jones (Best Supporting Actor) will not rest until he captures to Kimble no matter how.<br /><br />The impressive human chase is only surpassed by Rambo 1, but the final result is major than the sum of its parts. Fabulous action sequences and to my mind the best performance of Harrison Ford in his career, to date.<br /><br />Well deserved acknowledgement to Andrew Davis, a talented film maker, who by the way, is almost disappeared from the map.<br /><br />Recommended without reserves.<br /><br />PD. After you leave the hall, are you able to affirm (without blinking) a similar case can not be happening in any region of the world at this moment?</p></body></html>

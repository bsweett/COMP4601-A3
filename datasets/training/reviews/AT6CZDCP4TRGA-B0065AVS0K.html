<meta name="summary" content="noir comic book COOLNESS!"></head><body><p>I am not usually a fan of comic books, but this movie was done so well that it didn't really matter.<br /><br />Very absorbing, fascinating, outrageously twisted over the top graphic violence---but not all that gruesome actually, since the camera usually pulls away from the actual carnage in progress.  It's the mental cruelty of various characters at various moments that lingers, not the physical actions so much.<br /><br />What's striking is just how utterly dark, no "dark" is too weak a word, utterly BLACK of a world this film pulls you into.  Totally amoral sadistic savage anarchy, there are of course good and bad guys but even the good guys are just a few shades less twisted.  And it's saavy, in the socioeconomic and sociopolitical sense---we see a world of vast corruption and cruelty underneath the everyday sucker's illusion of normalcy and respectability.<br /><br />The all-star cast shines, even cinematic lightweights like Jessica Alba are well-directed enough not to screw things up.  Like the "Kill Bill" movies, you have to approach this film as mainly an excercise in style and genre, it is not meant to be judged in any sort of larger real-world context and best of all doesn't try to be more than what it is...a supremely original and entertaining 2 hours!</p></body></html>

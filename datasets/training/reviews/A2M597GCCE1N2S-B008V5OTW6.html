<meta name="summary" content="Suspense at an all time high"></head><body><p>Munich is the story about a secret Israeli squad sent out to track down and asassinate 11 targets who were believed responsible for the 1972 killing spree of 11 Israeli athletes during the Olympics by Palestinian terrorists, a group known as Black September.<br /><br /> The Israeli government hires a man named Avner [Eric Bana] to lead a team of 4 away from their families for months, maybe even years till their mission is complete. They will have to sacrifice their own well being as they venture into hostile territory as they track down their targets. At first Avner and his men are relaxed as they think it will be done in a couple of months, however the stress of tracking down their targets start to take a toll on themselves.<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush co-stars as Ephraim, the team handler. He sort of just hung around to check on the team's progress and also supplied them the money they needed to bribe people into helping them with their mission. Also in the movie is a paid French informant who supplies the names of the targets but also does not earn the trust of the full team as some question whether he is really helping them or not.<br /><br />The plot takes the team all over the Middle East, even areas such as France and London. There is also a lot of violent images such as brutal execution by the team members on their targets. They also show in flashbacks during the movie how the Israeli athletes were killed by the terrorists which aren't easy to see.<br /><br />However Avner shows a lot of compasion as he sees his new daughter and wife for the first time after being separated for such a long time. I did find some scenes in the movie to drag a bit, but a lot of suspense as the team members prepare to eliminate their next target brought the level up a lot.<br /><br />There aren't many extras on the DVD at all, although you do have the option of choosing to start the movie with a small introduction by Steven Spielberg himself as he talks about the story and how hard a subject it was to touch and make into a movie.<br /><br />Even though the extras section is lacking this is a great movie to see. A lot of suspense and even some sentimental scenes in between make this well worth checking out.<br /><br />Recommended</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="In The Vory Underworld, Tattoos Are Your Resume"></head><body><p>"In Eastern Promises, Cronenberg brings us face to face with the horror of self. The film's bristling invention and biting with can't stave off the dread. Sure, it's hard to take. Consolation isn't Cronenberg's business. But art as a response to the terrors of modern life should be yours." Peter Travers<br /><br />Eastern Promises is a tough, bristling film that shows the inside of the Russian Mafia, the Vory V Zakone syndicate. Viggo Mortenson, plays Nikolai, a driver and henchman for Semyon, played by Armin Mueller-Stahl, the owner of a trans-Siberian restaurant in London. Semyon looks like a nice old soul, but underneath he is a monster who will stop at nothing and his son, Kirill, Vincent Cassel, plays his  role masterfully, a man with no conscience.  Naomi Watts plays Anna, a midwife in London. She assists in the delivery of a baby born to a young 14 year old who was raped, and who dies after the birth. Anna tries to find the baby's relatives using her mother's diary. The diary is the secret life of Kirill and Semyon and their home of women used for their pleasure. Anna and Nikolai meet on several occasions, but Nikolai plays his role of the tough, haunted man to the hilt. For Anna and Nikolai, Semyon will unlock secrets neither wants to face.<br /><br />Viggo Mortensen is Nikolai,the menacing haunted driver who kills and maims but displays a softer side that is not easy to overlook. The bath house scene, where he fights for his life, naked, but for his tatoos, is one that will be remembered long after the film is forgotten. "Covered in tattoos, his body a scroll depicting his personal history of violence, Mortensen conveys a subtle blend of resolve and lost-ness. He's a true, haunting mystery man." --Robert Horton.<br /><br />David Cronenberg allows the violence to face us head on, there is no warning and we are upfront and then it recedes. But we remember what we have seen and heard and there is no going back. This is a world foreign to us, a world of horror, violence and a culture we cannot understand. Trafficking in human misery and total control of all things.<br /><br />"Just as the Russian Mafia tells stories through tattoos, it could be said that Eastern Promises is told through bloodshed." Brian Marden<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 02-23-08<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W18Z">American Yakuza</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQLZ0Q">A History of Violence (New Line Platinum Series)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NOIX48">The Painted Veil</a></p></body></html>

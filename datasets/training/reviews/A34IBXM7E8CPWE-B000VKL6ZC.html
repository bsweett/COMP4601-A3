<meta name="summary" content="Better Upon the 2nd Viewing"></head><body><p>When Rob Zombie's "Halloween" first came out, despite my initial reaction to anyone trying to remake Carpenter's classic, I went to see it in the theater. I hated it! Outside of the soundtrack, I thought there was little to no value in Zombie's film.<br /><br />For lack of anything better to watch I decided to give the movie another shot. I have to say I was pleasently surprised. While I still hate the opening 5 - 10 minutes or so (I think Zombie was a bit ham handed  and over the top in making sure the viewer knew Michael came from a dysfunctional family), the rest of the film was pretty gripping and interesting.<br /><br />As the movie starts out, we are introduced to the Myers family. A family so dysfunctional they would have to go to therapy in order to move into a trailer park. Stripper Mom, Alcoholic and Abusive Step-Dad, Trampy older sister named Judy, Wierdo and bullied Michael and the baby Laurie. Some people didn't like that we got Michael's backstory, I was one of them initially, because it was bit creepier thinking that Mike came from a good home and just snapped like in the original. With Zombie's film we get to see what creates the hulking psychopath seen in the second half of the film. When Michael finally snaps and kills one of the bullies from his school, it starts the killing spree that will conclude on Halloween night 18 years later (or continues 18 years later once the sequel came out?).<br /><br />Institutionalized because of the murders, Michael meets Dr. Loomis, a psychiatrist that initially tries to help Michael, but later exploits him and his crimes. Michael spends most of his life locked away in a small room, hiding and wearing masks of his own design until one Halloween night he decides to go home and find his little sister.<br /><br />Very bloody, boob filled and violent as all get out, Zombie definately makes the story his own. Zombie's version of Michael Myers is similar to the classic portrayal of Jason Voorhees from the "Friday the 13th" films, an unstoppable hulking, silent killer. In the old "Halloween" films, Michael was the boogeyman that lurked and popped up out of the dark. If you go into this film hoping to see Michael lurking in the background, slowly sneaking up on his prey...you'll hate this movie. There is nothing subtle about the scare or Michael in this movie.<br /><br />And while I don't think Zombie's version is nearly as good as Carpenter's classic, it's a good deal better than part's 4, 5, 6, & Resurrection. Zombie at least made Myers scary again.</p></body></html>

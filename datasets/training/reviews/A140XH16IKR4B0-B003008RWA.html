HMO chiefs raking in billions in profits? Insurance companies finding any loophole or lame reason to deny coverage? US politicians deep in the pocket of Big Pharma? It is so depressingly familiar and so well-known to anyone paying the least bit of attention to what is going on in this country.<br /><br />Moore does something that the endless stream of talking heads on TV never manages to do, and that is to show the anguish of real human beings who are daily fed into the meat grinder of the American health care system. From sick parents forced to foreclose and move back with their kids, to 79-year-olds working in menial jobs to keep their health care, to young, sick moms having to lie to get their meds across the border in Canada, Moore show us the faces and tells us the stories of Americans who have been thrown under the bus by a system bent on profit, profit and more profit.<br /><br />What might have been a ridiculous "Moore-ish" stunt - bringing 9/11 heroes to Guantanamo Bay to gain the same rights as terror suspects -- actually broke in Moore's favor. Moore managed to get his charges into the Cuban health care system, where (get this!) they were cared BASED ON THEIR NEED, NOT ON THEIR ABILITY TO PAY! One woman who pays hundreds of dollars for inhalers in the US was sold one for 5 cents. This poor woman, much of whose income goes to treating the airway injury she received digging victims out of the Pile, burst into tears at the indignity of having been screwed so thoroughly by the health care system of the nation for which she had sacrificed so much.<br /><br />"Sicko" also takes us to Paris and to London, where Moore explodes the myths that socialized health care is so terrible. When citizens of these nations get sick, if a government-funded doctor does not come to their door, they go to the hospital where they are promptly cared for, and at no charge. That's right, not grilled to make sure they can pay and not plied with high-priced designer drugs. It's no wonder that our politicians (and many of their witless, gulled constituents who happily vote against their own self-interest) mock the French so mercilessly. Clearly, if the average American knew the fleecing they were getting, and the way they are doing nothing but enriching the super-rich, they would revolt.<br /><br />"Sicko" should be a jolt for everyone who reflexively assumes that America is best at everything. Clearly, the nation that consistently places profits before people, then convinces them that this larcenous state of affairs is a better deal, a sign of patriotism and proof of advanced morals has a lot to answer for.<br /><br />Bravo, Michael Moore, for sticking your finger in the eye of the Man once again.</p></body></html>

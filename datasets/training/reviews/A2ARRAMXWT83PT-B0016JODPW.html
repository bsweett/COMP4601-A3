The performances are spectacular all around, the direction is flawless, the writing - AMAZING! One of Lumet's best films since "Dog Day Afternoon". Talk about a robbery gone wrong...geez.<br /><br />There aren't enough words to describe it, you just have to see it. NOW.<br /><br />Oh, yeah...the sex scene at the beginning is both pointless AND disgusting. There was NO NEED for that. Buhhhh.</p></body></html>

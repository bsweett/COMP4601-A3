This is one of the most intelligent and original dark comedies I have ever seen! It is a tale  of corruption -- police, politicians and the press -- and the people  involved. Set in Hollywood during the 1950's, the film illustrates police  corruption. There are many phony policemen, one of whom is Kevin Spacey's  character. He sells information to a sleazy tabloid journalist (played by  Danny Devito). The backdrop of the film sort of reminds me of Chinatown --  the best Technicolor noir film I have ever seen. The actors are incredible.  Kevin Spacey and Danny Devito are amazing, as are Russell Crowe and Guy  Pearce. But the real treat in this film is Kim Basinger; she earned that  Academy Award. This is a compelling and brutally honest thriller that  should definitely be owned. I highly recommend this film, especially on  DVD.</p></body></html>

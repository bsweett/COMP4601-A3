<meta name="summary" content="Jaguar"></head><body><p>Fascinating, Brutally violent at times, historically plausible (no one knows exactly what happened to the Mayans or to their civilization...hence the mystery that has surrounded them for centuries) yet at times profoundly touching and personal, Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" is, after all is said and done, after all is shown on the screen, a story about one man, Jaguar Paw (a terrific Rudy Youngblood) and his family (wife Seven played by Dalia Hernandez, his son and his father). As "Braveheart" was basically about  William Wallace, so Director Gibson smartly  uses one character as a repository of all his thematic material thereby focusing not diffusing our attention on something  upon which we cannot relate (though, to be truthful and based on Gibson's recent public outburst, you can't help wondering what the subtext here is...i.e. how this relates to our current political and religious situation): i.e. in this case the last days of a crumbling Mayan civilization which, out of desperation has put all its hopes in basically witch doctors who attempt to appeal to the "Gods" via human sacrifice.<br />Jaguar Paw, as one of the many captured by the ruling tribe, is the center of our attention thereby making his plight personal. JP as portrayed by Rudy Youngblood is strong, handsome, brave, intelligent, a loving husband, son and parent. When he is captured and sent to be sacrificed, degraded by his captors, even then his innate goodness and bravery shine through.<br />The Centerpiece of "Apocalypto" is the Temple scene at which the High Priest (a disgustingly smug Fernando Hernandez) spills the blood and removes the entrails of several men (the captured women are sold off like cattle) all in service of the "Gods."<br />Gibson films this scene in what can only be called a frightening, crazy, frantic manner: the beheadings, the Royal family smirking, the thousands of citizens screaming for blood, the heads rolling down from the upper regions of the temple: the camera swirling all around from the frightened faces of the captives soon to be killed to the strange, almost immobile, because of face markings and headgear, grin of the King (a very weird looking Rafael Velez). The scene becomes almost unbearable because of the intensity with which it is staged and filmed...then Gibson pulls away.<br />To me all that is important about Gibson as a director is that he makes good movies. And "Apocalypto," though not up to the level of his "Passion of The Christ" is a very good movie. It's furiously paced, it's beautiful to watch, the acting is first rate and it is infused with the sounds and vistas of an almost mystical and very much mysterious time and place: a place and a time that Gibson brings alive by way of his special and profound magic.</p></body></html>

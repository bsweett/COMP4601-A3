It was that action film that everyone seemed to love during the nineties and for good reason; it had high octane action, a great cast, and it managed to just keep going even when you thought it was going to end like ten minutes prior. Now get rid of the bus and replace it with an out of control train carrying explosive chemicals. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are now Denzel Washington and Chris Pine, which means Joe Morton is now Rosario Dawson and Dennis Hopper is Kevin Dunn...or something. Anyway, the point is, Unstoppable in a nutshell is basically Speed on a train.<br /><br />The first thing that comes to mind with Unstoppable is how incredibly LOUD it is. It seemed like the knob to the volume was broken off after it was turned past its limitations during the sound editing process. If you aren't listening to an out of control train squealing on railroad tracks, it's the soundtrack full of heavy guitar riffs that rumbles the floor under your seat. The other kind of bizarre thing was the weird zoom-in Unstoppable used in the first half of the film. We'd open on a shot of actors talking, but then the camera would zoom-in slightly sometimes more than once. It was probably used to try and add suspense to whatever the actors were talking about at the time, but it came off as irritating more than anything. Thankfully, it wasn't done the entire film. I seem to remember it happening during another recent film that I can't put my finger on, but it's more than likely another Tony Scott film.<br /><br />In a film like this, acting is kind of secondary. As long as they're reacting to whatever threat is currently posed against them in a way that seems realistic, then it's safe to say that they've done their job well. This isn't the best work of any of the actors involved. Denzel Washington definitely shined brighter in both Man on Fire (another Tony Scott film) and The Book of Eli from earlier this year and Chris Pine hasn't really done anything as impressive as his portrayal of Captain James Kirk in last year's Star Trek. Then there's Rosario Dawson whose role as Connie seems kind of safe for the actress as it seems way too similiar to most of the other roles in her repertoire. The thing is though that it all works out in the end to deliver a film that is both thrilling and exciting. People go to the movies to be entertained and this film does that very well. The one problem with Unstoppable is that it doesn't seem to give any weight to the several emotional factors of the film. We know just enough to realize both Frank and Will will lose a lot if they fail at trying to stop this train and while it does work, I can't help but feel like the film would have had an even bigger impact if we had spent a little more time getting to know Frank's daughters or having a little more depth to Will's situation with his wife and son.<br /><br />Unstoppable is a white knuckled, edge of your seat thriller that has a way of making you feel like you're thrown in front of the railroad tracks as this unstoppable train approaches during the most suspenseful and knuckle biting scenes. The thriller is very similar to what Speed would be like today if it took place on a train, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Unstoppable is definitely an exciting way to waste an hour and a half.</p></body></html>

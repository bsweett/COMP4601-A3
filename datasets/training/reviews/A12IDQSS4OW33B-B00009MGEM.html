Here's what goes on:<br /><br />A few pals are driving in the back roads of America when they stop by Capt. Spaulding's Museum of Horrors/gas station/food bar, they admit that they're lost. So, before they leave, Capt. Spaulding gives them a ride on his Murder Ride {which is quite interesting} and tells them of some things about murderers and stuff. After that he is convinced in drawing them a map. When they pick up a hitchhiker on the way, someone blows out the tires on their car and they are stranded at the hitchhiker's house where the fun begins. Will they get to leave? Who else lives there? And what do THEY have planned?? To find out, you're going to have to see it.</p></body></html>

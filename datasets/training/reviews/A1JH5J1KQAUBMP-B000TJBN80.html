<meta name="summary" content="Superior sequel"></head><body><p>The rage virus that decimated England is thought to have run its course, and the US military oversees the reintroduction of British citizens to a protected zone.  The existence of this sequel testifies to the fact that this does not go smoothly.<br /><br />This ultraviolent film is superior to the first, which had a very lackluster ending.  The vision of director/co-writer Juan Carlos Fresnadillo and co-writers Rowan Joffe, E.L. Lavigne, and Jesus Olmo is bleak, uncompromising, and even heart-breaking.  There are many sympathetic characters, but every act of tenderness results in disaster, resulting in a world where humanity's better nature actually works against it, possibly resulting in its ultimate destruction.  The movie falters a bit at the end when it reintroduces a character in a very contrived manner, but it is not enough to derail this powerful film.  Robert Carlyle stands out in the excellent cast.</p></body></html>

Ash, his girlfriend, his sis, his buddy, and his buddy's girlfriend. The place is eerie and disturbing, and there's something creeping around in and out. While checking out the basement, Ash and his pal find an old book, a dagger, and a tape containing an ancient ritual chant that awakes the Evil Dead! From here on out it's gore and mayhem Sam Raimi style! The kids struggle to stay alive, but things just aren't going their way! And by the end of the film, an unlikely hero is born! You won't know that though, unless you check out the sequels, Evil Dead 2:Dead By Dawn, and MY personal favorite, Army of Darkness. I liked them so much I dressed as Ash a couple Halloweens ago, and will likely do it again, using this book as a prop next time!<br />  This is just the coolest thing I've seen in a while! I wish more DVD's would go the extra mile the way they did with this one! I must admit, when I first saw this DVD in person I was a bit disappointed because I thought it was supposed to be much bigger, and was worried it would be around regular DVD size. Problem was I was thinking of the way the book was presented in Army of Darkness, I had forgotten that in Evil Dead, it IS around DVD size. Anyways, realizing this upon viewing the movie again, I was quite happy. The case is outstanding! You can see that by the pic. Inside are the actual pages of the Necronomicon, as seen in the trilogy, and the cool thing is that the text CAN be read if you concentrate! There are hidden little phrases throughout, such as "Make movies, not war!" 10 stars for the case alone baby! As for the disc, another winner! I had this film on VHS, and had been waiting for a definitive DVD before shelling out the cash for one! This is the one to get if you weren't sure which Edition to buy! And buy it now! At 29.99 it is a tad over priced, but from what I have read the price is only going to go up! Anyway, back to the disc, it contains the trailer and TV spots, a still/poster gallery, two commentaries, one by Bruce Campbell, which is hilarious, and one by writer and director Sam Raimi and producer Robert Tapert, which is watchable, there's an outtakes real that I admit I didn't find all that great, a fan documentary done by Bruce Campbell (awesome!), a short film of interviews about trying to get the movie made, and I have no idea if I'm leaving something out! The film itself is a classic of course, and it's great to see it in widescreen on DVD quality! I remember the first time I saw it, back in high school, and it scared me to death! The sequels just get better and better too! Do yourself a favor and pick it up before it's gone! And if after viewing all 3 films, you're itching for part four, grab "Evil Dead:Hail to the King" for the Playstation video game system.</p></body></html>

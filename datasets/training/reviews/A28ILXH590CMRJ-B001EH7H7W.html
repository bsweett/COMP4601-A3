<meta name="summary" content="LEAGUE is a solid, if shallow, action flick"></head><body><p>Years after his prime adventuring days in Africa, the great hunter Allan Quartermain (Sean Connery) is recruited by the British government to lead an elite squad and prevent a World War.  When he finally arrives in London he finds that his fellow squad members are each gifted with unique talents.....and even darker secrets.  Reading like a Who's Who of 19th Century literature, Quartermain must deal with characters ranging from the never-aging Dorian Gray to the infamous Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  Given the unstable personalities, can this squad complete its mission...or will they turn on each other?  THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN takes this conceit and crafts a flick that, while short on depth, provides a non-stop ride of action and thrills.  Based on the now-classic comic book series by Alan Moore,  the film is wonderfully mounted and harkens back to the old days of 19th Century thrillers. The movie moves at a good clip and never drags as events move along.  Also, the special effects are very solid, with Captain Nemo's famous sub, the Nautilus, being the most impressive. By now, Sean Connery is an old hand at this types of roles, and he brings a delightful crustiness as the aging Quatermain. Stuart Townsend is delightfully snide as Dorian Gray, while Peta Wilson smolders with sexuality as the vampiric Mina Harker (the heroine from Bram Stoker's "Dracula.")  Naseerruddin Shah is stern and stalwart as the legendary Captain Nemo.<br />However, the movie isn't without its flaws.  Fans of the comics may find themselves disappointed, since the film substitiues a new plot for the comic's and only Shah's Nemo is true to the source.  Also, aside from Connery and Shah, the characters are pretty much one-demensional.  Indeed, the movie assumes that you already know the back stories of these characters.  As a result, if you haven't read the comics or the novels in which these characters appeared, you'd be at a disadvantage. Also, when Quartermain deduces the identity of the real villian near the end of the film, there's no real indication of where he got the knowledge.<br />Overall, though, LEAGUE is a solid film that will appeal to the action-lover who takes his English lit with a sense of fun, and it's worth recommending if you have the right frame of mind.</p></body></html>

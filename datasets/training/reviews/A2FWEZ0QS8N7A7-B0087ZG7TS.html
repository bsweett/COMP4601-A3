<meta name="summary" content="Great Promo for the Novel"></head><body><p>Atonement is Masterpiece Theater at the Cineplex.  Its virtues are excellent acting and cinematography, a classic British country house, perfect period pieces -- check out, for example, the Guinness ad on a pre-WWII bus --, a scene of absurdity and chaos as the British are evacuated from Dunkirk, and -- most of all -- superb source material, Ian McEwen's novel of the same name.  Briony is a smart and creative 13 year old who does not know or understand all she thinks she does.  When her creativity embroiders an incident she does not understand, personal calamities ensue, not least -- as Vanessa Redgrave's wonderful portrayal of Briony decades later near the end of her life makes clear -- to the girl herself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film labors at times.  Even conceding that they must portray those stiff British upper lips, class divisions and all that, the lovers, Keira Knightly and James McAvoy, lack chemistry.  A laggard pace and awful sound track that is loudly obtrusive at all the wrong moments also mar the movie.  This makes Atonement a good, not great, film that retains the capacity to suggest just how great McEwen's novel is.</p></body></html>

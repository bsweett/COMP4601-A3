<meta name="summary" content="Go Nacho!"></head><body><p>Like Napoleon Dynamite, Nacho Libre is going to have people on both sides of the fence, leaving few sitting on it.  Count me on the "for" side - in fact, this is the funniest, and one of the most heart warming movies of 2006.  After a number of disappointments, it was an absolute pleasure to sit through a movie with a script that sings, characters that one wants to root for from the beginning and a soundtrack that can't help but keep a smile on  your face.<br /><br />Jack Black is in Shallow Hal mode here, alternating  between disgusting and endearing, and cracking the audience up at every turn.  A lot of reviews have mentioned this is not much more than Black running around half naked and sporting a faux Mexican personnage.  It is so much more than that.  Black's "Nacho" is a classic tortured spirit, caught up in the ordinariness of his mundane life as a Friar at an orphanage but dreams of stardom as a luchadore . . . and, of course, love.<br /><br />The love interest here is a little complicated as it's a nun Nacho's in love with;  Sister Sister Encarnaci&oacute;n, portrayed by the stunning Ana de la Reguera (who strongly resembles a younger Penelope Cruz).<br /><br />Nacho's sidekick features an amazingly hilarious physical actor, the rubbery faced, thin-as-a-noodle, Hector Jimenez as Esqueleto.  His screams alone are worth the price of admission.<br /><br />There are sight gags throughout of the highest - and lowest - order, touches of the bizarre that echo Mr. Hess's first major effort; combined with an at times almost childlike sense of wonderment and look at life.<br /><br />This is a major American filmmaker's sophmore effort and it is a glorious, wonderful, big smelly valentine of a movie.  You couldn't ask for more from a summer flick than Nacho has to offer.  See it!</p></body></html>

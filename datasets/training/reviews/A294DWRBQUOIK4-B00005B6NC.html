<meta name="summary" content="An alien clone, but far better than many."></head><body><p>Okay this film does share alot with Alien, but it is still a very enjoyable film to watch. Vin Diesel was without a doubt the most interesting character in the film. <p>  Alot of good lines and overall acting made all of them pretty good. The effects were very clever and some I found spectacular. The planet coming over the horizen I particully liked.<p>  My only real complaints are they never really say what happen at the start. And they never really show what they eat as there doesn't seem to much else on the planet. They show the aliens fighting each other, but not so much eating each other. So what do they survive on?<p>  But still a suspenseful and riveting watch.</p></body></html>

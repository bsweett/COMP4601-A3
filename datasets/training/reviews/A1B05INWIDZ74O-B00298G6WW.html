They meet at a bar in Mexico where the real adventure begins with the strangest friendship that is somewhat believable considering where they both were in their lives. It is sort of black comedy about doing the right thing. And there is an interesting twist in the movie. They both do a superb job of acting that is what drives this movie. This character driven movie does have some strong sexual content.</p></body></html>

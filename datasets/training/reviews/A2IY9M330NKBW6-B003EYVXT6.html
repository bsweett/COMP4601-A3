Though this is no great movie by any standard it is replete with the possibilities available for the subject. Here you have two romantically entwined gene scientists who grow a female something or other that lives and begins to mature. Now what? Looks like they didn't think that far ahead because things go so far that the situation begins to move under its own weight.<br /><br />The first act is kind of a drag. They're setting up the story and it involves a lot of science with read-outs, graphics and such, and it doesn't make for a very inviting viewer experience. When the second act starts though things begin to heat up, and as good it is, it also hints at all sorts of things the script doesn't deal with. Such as the fact that they're nurturing an intelligent female being that is maturing rapidly with no hope of ever having a true loving, sexual counterpart. This is also a being that has to be, because of legal issues, hidden from the rest of the world. She will never be part of "regular" society. There is also the area of physiology. This being has been created. All sorts of things can go wrong. Do all her parts work in harmony? How will food react with her system? Does she have too many teeth or too few? Will she have a menstrual cycle? Some of these things they deal with a bit, but there is a well spring of items that go untapped.<br /><br />The third act starts out pretty good but gets a bit too much at the climax. It could have been much worse though. I have to say that watching this movie made me more than a bit nervous. All the things roiling under the surface, but never brought forth, still made an impact on my nervous system.<br /><br />Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley do well in there rolls but Delphine Chaneac, as the being Dren, was outstanding. Kudos must go to both the art department and special effects department for their realization of the character. She is someone who will not be forgotten once she's been seen. This is well worth seeing. It might not be a perfect movie, but the highs are real high and make the rest of it watchable at the least.</p></body></html>

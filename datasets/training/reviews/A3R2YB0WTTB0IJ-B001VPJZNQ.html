<meta name="summary" content="PETER BERG, OPUS 2"></head><body><p>***1/2 2003. Directed by Peter Berg. The Rock must bring back the son of a L.A. mobster who's searching for a golden statue in the Amazonian jungle. Great stunts and an always terrific Christopher Walken as the villain. The screenplay was co-written by James Vanderbilt who already wrote the scripts of two other above average action movies: John McTiernan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009L1TA">Basic</a> and David Fincher's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QUCNP4">Zodiac (Widescreen Edition)</a>. At last, note Arnold Schwarzenegger cameo at the beginning of the movie. Recommended.</p></body></html>

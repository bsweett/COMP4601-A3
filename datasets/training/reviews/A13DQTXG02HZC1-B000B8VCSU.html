<meta name="summary" content="Good Will Hunting?"></head><body><p>This movie is not different from Good Will Hunting & Finding Forrester.  The main character is talented & yet, flawed at the same time.  The neighbourhood is rough & he grows up faster than he should be.  Innocence is lost & survival is the key.  Like any other feel good movies, he's blessed with genuine friends who are selfless & supportive all along.  They know that he's a diamond ready to be cut but before that, he needs to be made known that he's TRULY something.  Eventually, he finds the truth & that he's courageous enough to take the next step into manhood, to be somebody.  I don't need to say more about Eminem's acting capability.  He's in his element & it's surprising to note his charisma on-screen.  It's difficult to get our eyes off him.  The supporting cast is amazing.  Brittany Murphy is convincing as a white trash girl who would "sell" her body to get somewhere; Mekhi Phiffer (the Negro doctor in ER)& Kim Basinger are all wonderful.  What made "8 Mile" even more compelling to watch is the slum neighbourhood in Detroit which the Director uses to his advantage.  Even though the story is predictable, it's still a wonderful movie to watch.  The rap scene is quite an eye-opener for someone who's new to the alternative culture aspect of United States.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

The zombies are similar to the ones in Return of the Living Dead, except that the intelligence and spoken words are taken out of context. The scares, despite having more obvious shock effects, do have the same effect as Land of the Dead and the original Dawn of the Dead. It may not have the same cult following as the original, but it is indeed way creepier. It's yet another classic in the zombies genre.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></body></html>

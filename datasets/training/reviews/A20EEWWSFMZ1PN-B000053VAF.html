Evidently two ejected angels sent to Wisconsin for the duration have found a loophole that will allow them to return to Heaven unscathed. Seems that no one from above or below really wants this to happen. So several beings with their own agenda are coercing Bethany Sloane (Linda Fiorentino) to do their dirty work as she unknowingly is the only one qualified.<br /><br />Will Bethany be able to stop the two angels before it is too late? Or is there a sinister unnamed force helping the fallen angels to succeed?<br /><br />Some of the actors are just coasting through the movie (probably to pick up some spending cash).  But Alan Rickman is excellent as usual and plays the indignant part to the hilt. See him again in "Galaxy Quest" made the same year.<br /><br />Defiantly designed for certain genre tastes (sort of a cross between Ghost Busters and Monty Python with a little Arthur Miller tossed in.) I personally found it a tad too potty mouthed and over obsessed with sex. Other than that it brings up good premises and a few eternal questions. This is defiantly on of those films that need to be viewed more than once to pick up on the nuances'<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0822202492">The Creation of the World and Other Business.</a></p></body></html>

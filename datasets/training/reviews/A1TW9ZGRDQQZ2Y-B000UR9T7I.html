The use of CGI is well done and there are numerous funny scenes to lighten the mood a bit. The only slight negative was that some of the scenes did drag on a bit too long at times. The use of three villains was pretty cool. I liked them all, but Venom could have used much more screen time. He should have been saved for the only villian in Spider-Man 4.<br /><br />Well, with an opening day of around 59 million dollars, you reading this have probably already seen it. If not, swing (pun intended) by your local theater now.</p></body></html>

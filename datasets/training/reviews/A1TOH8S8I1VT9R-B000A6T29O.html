<meta name="summary" content="BANG BANG!! SMASH CLANG!!!  IT IS WHAT IT IS!!!"></head><body><p>As someone who has never played the game, I am looking at this strictly as Film entertainment...  YEEHAAA!!!<br />Let's not get carried away, this is not Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Not even close.  Here's the breakdown;<br />-It is to "Treasure seeking adventure" as Resident Evil is to "Zombie Horror".<br />-If you're looking for high art, this is not for you.<br />-If you want challenging plot that keeps you guessing... nope.<br />-If you enjoy lots of action held together by an extremely simple plot, you can't go wrong.<br />-For what it is (pure action movie) it is very well done and entertaining.<br />-I was never insulted by dialogue or story because I wasn't expecting to be challenged, just entertained.<br />-It's certainly better than one star.  That's just snobbish.<br />-It's not for everyone. Rent it first.<br /><br />This is one of those "put it in and let it go" kind of films.  Great after a stressful day.  Not a lot of thought required, but engaging entertainment.</p></body></html>

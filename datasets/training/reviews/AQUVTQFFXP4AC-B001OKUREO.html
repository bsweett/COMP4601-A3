<meta name="summary" content="Plain and boring film for a plain and boring man?"></head><body><p>On a side note, I hope Oliver Stone was joking in an appearance he made on The Colbert Report when he praised George W. Bush's presidency and said he was the greatest president in history. He scares me sometimes, Stone does.<br /><br />On another note, the movie does not feel much at all like an Oliver Stone-type movie, though it has enough of his style in it: frequent and non-chronological flashbacks (Alexander, JFK, Natural Born Killers, etcetera), and a perpetual Father/Child conflict (Natural Born Killers, Platoon, Alexander).<br /><br />For the cast, they did the best they could, and most of the actors very much look and sound the role, from Richard Dreyfuss whose resemblance to Cheney is marred only by Dreyfuss's liver spots and slightly darker skin, to Thandie Newton's Condoleeza Rice, and Bruce McGill's George Tenet.<br /><br />The others fall a bit short, such as Scott Glenn, who's much too skinny, shrimpy, and sleazy Richard-Belzer-looking to pull off a convincing Donald Rumsfeld; he looks more like an older version of that guy who hosted Beat the Geeks on Comedy Central. Josh Brolin gets Bush's voice and movements down perfectly without looking or sounding like a comedic parody, while James Cromwell manages to encapsulate gravitas, but is pretty much a completely different person than George HW Bush. And Toby Jones's face is too misshapen to fit much like Karl Rove.<br /><br />The movie in itself takes a very straight-forward, unbiased approach, which while offering some mildly interesting insights (such as Bush's first experience with attack ads in his first run for Governor of Texas, to his incorporation of them in his father's Presidential campaign), these only remain MILDLY interesting; the movie just shows us things we would have heard about in the news or read about in biographies or writings. The more personal moments have a sort of disappointing factor about them in that they are complete and utter conjecture, and they STILL fail to provide more than just superficial filler or exposition.<br /><br />Humor is so light and toned-down as to be nonexistent; very little is funny here beyond slight chuckles or snortles.<br /><br />For the character of George Bush itself, the movie only serves to humanize him in a way that could have been done with a simple documentary maybe half as long: For example, his early party and drinking days are dished out in such a way as to show him not as a nasty, crude, misogynistic, college frat-boy like you might see in bad teen comedies like "Sorority Boys" (or the frat guys in "Borat"), but as a regular guy who makes friends in a fraternity, drinks a lot, and has simple dreams of doing this or that, oblivious to the fact that only his father's wealth and influence gets him there.<br /><br />His presidency is treated in such a way that Bush is both distant from the darker and more shady aspects, while always on top of everything as "The Decider"---there is the lunch scene where he agrees to an "enhanced interrogation" measure simply by seeing that the measure is three pages long, and thus he'll trust Cheney to carry it out humanely, and then proceeds to exert clear power over Cheney by sternly telling him he wants this treated responsibly.<br /><br />In another scene in the war room, Cheney and Rumsfeld go off on tangents regarding Iraq and Iran, and a seeming future fantasy of an American Empire dominating the Middle East. Bush quashes this and brings everyone's focus back on Iraq.<br /><br />The movie portrays Bush as almost as much of a victim with regards to the Iraq War as the American people were---George Tenet is the one frustrated by the severely questionable evidence for Saddam's WMDs, and yet Cheney pushes for its inclusion in official reports to a degree that Tenet simply gives up and allows it to be passed as solid intelligence. By 2004, Bush is seen angrily demanding from his top officials why no WMDs have been found and questioning if there even were any to begin with.<br /><br />Little else really happens, and the direction is very clear on focusing on Bush's turbulent relationship with his father as his motivation for almost every major decision in his career, always to seek his father's approval without an undermining addendum (If only I could have attended two inaugurations this year, Bush Sr. says to that effect before George W.'s inauguration as Governor of Texas, after Jeb Bush lost his run in Florida).<br /><br />In total, the film is only controversial in that some people will claim it's boring and other people will claim it's bullcrap. It does a highly successful job of making Bush a human figure and a likable person, while at the same time doing a complete spin-job by making him seem utterly unaccountable for any of the bad things that had happened throughout his administration, and giving absolutely no background information on the supposedly close relationship with George Bush and Karl Rove. Considering how he is portrayed as the Ego to his Administration's Id (Cheney and Rumsfeld, and to a smaller degree, Rice) and its Superego (A highly tragic Colin Powell, portrayed by Jeffrey Wright fantastically, George Tenet, and others), this can only amount to either top-notch spin, or such a powerful desire to overcome a controversial reputation as to go in the complete opposite direction of a "hatchet-job" as to accidentally do just as bad a thing in making a hero of a man who is neither hero nor villain. He's just Bush.</p></body></html>

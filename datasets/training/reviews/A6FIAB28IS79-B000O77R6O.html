Obviously, numerous viewers find the film provocative, innovative, mysterious, profound and deeply moving in terms substance and form, meaning and creative use of the medium.  Any film these days that's able at once to challenge, enthrall, and motivate viewers to become alert and "active" spectators deserves no small amount of commendation--and most likely another look (at the very least) from this reviewer.  I would take issue with the notion that the film is sentimental or pretentious--or that either of those words is necessarily pejorative (Griffith was certainly pretentious but no less of a giant; "It's a Wonderful Life" is as sentimental as it is dark, but not even the anti-sentimental '60s and '70s could suppress Capra's neglected but vibrantly alive American "basic text" for long.  Still, as informative and healthy as informed discussion can be, we will never (thank god) escape the fact that many of the medium's greatest accomplishments will not get their just due, and that one viewer's "Citizen Kane" will be another's "Star Wars: The Latest Sequel."]<br /><br /> D.W. Griffith needed six hours ("Intolerance," original release) to tell four simultaneous, closely interlocked stories separated in time by 2500 years.  The result was one of film's noblest failures.  Chris Marker, on the other hand, required less than 30 minutes ("La Jetee")  to tell an unforgettable story about humankind's fear of death, desire for love, and the ensuing but inescapable struggle with the past, the present, and the future to conquer death and aloneness.<br /><br />At about 90 minutes, "The Fountain" succeeds in fascinating us with its surrealist, psychedelic imagery, and if it fails to convince some that it has something significant to say or its meaning as clear as some would like, it's not for lack of trying.  In fact, everything about this film all but shrieks at the viewer "important allegory," "vital parable," "deep, profound, thought-provoking cinema."  Doesn't matter if it's a flower bud, a finger, a ring (the latter are certainly overworked symbols, especially after Dante and Wagner rung from rings just about all the meaning they're capable of yielding, though admittedly that didn't discourage Joseph Campbell, whose monomythic circle representing the hero's journey has become the frequent formula of no small number of the screenplays we see these days)--it's all deeply, profoundly, evocatively significant.  And lest we have the least doubt, the score bleats at us non-stop with throbbing strings italicized by spiritual soprano choirs--somber minor key modalities and thick textures relieved occasionally by new-age piano light rays. In fact, it's the kind of score that, unlike the reactionary constructions of a John Williams', takes us further away from the exemplary work of a Bernard Herrmann or Hugo Friedhofer.<br /><br />Of the three stories, only the one in the present--of the doctor desperately seeking a cure for his beloved's illness (cancer, but in the terms of the story, death is the "illness")--has any humanity, any semblance of "life" (though even here, the acting seems at times a bit stiff and "operatic," a hostage to the symbolism of the story, orchestrated by the camera and effects.)  The other two stories are narrative "frames," occasionally shedding some illumination on what is one of the darkest films (literally) I've ever seen (including hundreds of film noir examples along with most of Bergman).  Despite the inevitable pretense of the genre, there are the best of intentions, one suspects, behind the film, and young viewers who are taken in by it sufficiently to watch it again and work out its symbolism are undeniably apt to be rewarded, especially compared to the viewers of a "Titanic," "Forrest Gump," or any number of more childish (not merely sophomoric) "fantasy genre" movies (again, not a negative so much as a mere observation--certainly the inclusion of Clarence is sufficient to qualify Capra's seasonal classic as "fantasy" genre).<br /><br />Moreover, visual-architectural enthusiasts will have much to admire in the match cutting (from faces to symmetrical and luminescent correlatives, both man-made and natural, and the camera angles (those overhead aerial shots!), which often play more like music than the music does.  But were I a fan of a more hard-core, cleverly-engineered and artfully designed fantasy (I won't belabor a definition here--though Dante's Comedia and Wagner's Ring, despite sharing similarities with the genre, are as much its antithesis as is, say, "Tokyo Story."), I'd be more inclined to study the script and mis en scene (which even a movie like "Donnie Darko" can repay with insights not sighted after a mere two screenings).  Time is precious, and I'm grateful the filmmakers of "The Fountain" elected not to overextend their welcome.  Nonetheless, two hours of "There Will Be Blood" strikes me as a movie more worthy of close study than "The Fountain" if only because, as Dr. Johnson required of dramatic art and found so readily present in Shakespeare's, it "holds the mirror up to nature" (film's verisimilitudinous strong suit) so that we can see it, as if for the first time.<br /><br />A quick interpretation, maybe more Mishima than Buddhist: You can't "have" the Tree of Life because you ARE the tree.  To have it, to obtain it, to acquire or possess it, is to "objectify" it--in other words, to rob it of life.  Only the subject is alive: the object necessarily dead.  Once we recognize our relationship to the tree of life, we are eternally alive, immune from mundane materialistic understandings of death. There is no taking away from us what we never actually  "had" because the tree is what we "are."  Coming into "possession" of this understanding, or state of blessed "nothingness," requires undergoing the quest of the conquistador, doctor, scientist, lover in the movie.</p></body></html>

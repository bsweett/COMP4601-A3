If you love boxing films you will flip over this picture. Ron Howard got it right. Heart and depth are perfect adjectives to describe what unfolds before you. Russell Crow should easily have won an acadamy award for his portrayal as Braddock. The semi rags to riches story of a boxer in the 30's who forges on against overwhelming odds should grab even the most emotionally closed of persons.<br />  Paul Giamitti is spot on as Braddocks trainer, showing us all what it takes to throw oneself into a role. The highs and lows of life, the force of passion, true love and brutal honesty make it work on all levels. The depression era look is drab enough to feel, bringing the charactors despair realisticly to the forefront. And, of course being a boxing film it has action aplenty in the ring. The "chic flick" elements give the movie an ability to be soft and tender, but the harsh blows of action will hold the male audiences eyes. Both sexes can appreciate this well done made in America story. Destined to be a true classic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A House Is Not A Home"></head><body><p>When I first heard about this movie I didn't want to see it. The story-line seemed too lite. I didn't think it would be able to sustain my interest. Then the reviews came in, and the public reaction, and the award nominations, and soon I had to see what all the fuss was about.<p> Directed by Vadim Perelman "House of Sand and Fog" is an emotional and visual masterpiece. The movie doesn't just create characters, it breathes life into them and makes them seem real. The screenplay by Perelman and Shawn Lawrence Otto based on a novel by Andre Dubus II does something pretty fascinating. To give you a vague idea the movie has Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley fighting over who is the rightful owner of a house. The house was given to Connelly after her father died, but, when back taxes are not paid she is evicted and soon the house is up for auction. It is Kingsley, an Iranian immigrant who buys the house. And so the feud starts. But, the movie is able to present both sides to us. We can see what the house means for both sides. For Connelly it's a rememberance of her past, for Kingsley it means looking forward to the future. Our emotions keep shifting back and forth. We feel sorry for everyone involved and after a while we don't know what to think.<p> The acting in this movie has been getting a lot of attention, and righfully so, but as I watched this movie Roger Deakins' (who usually works with the Coen Brothers) cinematography caught my eye. He is able to get such beautiful shots along with David Stockton.<p> But I suppose it is the acting that will get people into the seats to watch this movie. Connelly after her performance in "A Beautiful Mind" keeps up her winning streak. I can't reveal too much about her character other than saying she's a "lost soul". She just seems to be on the wrong track. To many it is a disappointment she didn't receive an Oscar nomination. Kingsley on the other hand is kind of the cliche "tough as nails" sterotype idea we have of the kind of character he is playing. But it is effective.<p> Vadim Perelman has directed a powerful absorbing masterpiece. The movie seems real. When it was over everyone in the theather was kind of numb. As the credits rolled no one wanted to get up. We all just wanted to sit down and think about what we had seen. How many movies can we say that about? This is one of the best movies of 2003.<p> Bottom-line: Easily one of the most powerful absorbing and interesting working in 2003. Wonderful performance given by this entire cast. Everyone shines. Perelman directs with a sure-fired hand. He bring these characters to life.</p></body></html>

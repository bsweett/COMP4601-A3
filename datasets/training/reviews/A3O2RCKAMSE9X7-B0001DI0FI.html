Crowe continues his tradition of playing strong-minded characters in his role of Captain Jack Aubrey, the commander of Her Majesty's Ship, The Surprise, during the English-French war of 1805.  What director Peter Weir brings to the screen is an exciting and as astonishing a sea adventure saga that combines the best of the Horation Hornblower series with Captain Kirk from STAR TREK.  Weir captures the essence of what it must have been like to be a sailor of that time.  Part of the believability lies in Weir's portrayal of the natural elements of shipboard life: the cold, the hunger, the salt spray, the lack of women.  But what makes this film click is a series of subtexts that explores the infinitely illogical relationship between duty and frienship.  Serving as ship's doctor is Lieutenant Stephen Maturin (Peter Bettany, who played Crowe's non-existent roommate from A BEAUTIFUL MIND).  Maturin is more than just the rather youngish ship's surgeon.  He is a naturalist one generation before Darwin.  He longs to explore the unknown flora and fauna of the Galapagos Islands.  Several times, Captain Aubrey promises him the opportunity to do so but each time the exigencies of war force him to do otherwise.  This clashing of wills is only but the most obvious of themes that elevate MASTER AND COMMANDER to a superior sea war film.  Director Weir further examines the delicate balancing act that any commanding officer faces when deciding just how close that officer can allow himself to be towards his crew.<p>The plot is straightforward and uncomplicated.  Aubrey is ordered to seek out and destroy the Acheron, a vessel that is much faster and more heavily armed than Aubrey's.  During this chase, each ship takes turns chasing the other, with the ultimate confrontation resulting in a roaringly load sea battle that seems as exciting as it was undoubtedly authentic.  There is more than a few passing references to Star Trek, especially the episode where Kirk disguises himself as a Romulan to defeat a vessel of superior technology.  MASTER AND COMMANDER seems sure to garner a few Oscars, probably for Best Picture and Best Actor.  It was truly a pleasure to see such a politically incorrect film wow the audience in a way that would have made Errol Flynn proud.</p></body></html>

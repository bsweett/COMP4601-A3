<meta name="summary" content="Good effort by Howard"></head><body><p>For about the first hour (!) or so, I felt the Da Vinci code was a bit of a slog.  That said, overall it really isn't a bad movie.  Ron Howard, who is kind of a poor man's Spielberg, had the good sense to populate his movie with A-list actors.  This is a good thing, because every ten minutes or so there is some explanation for a mystery or puzzle, that is usually best left on the page rather than in a movie.  And Da Vinci Code has those in dizzying numbers.  The result is that Hanks (bad hair!) as super symbol-guy Robert Langdon, and Audrey Tautou (good hair!) as cryptologist Sophie Nevue are pretty much reduced to (as they catch their breath) constantly delivering where-are-we-now speeches in their hunt for the "truth."  As much as this cuts against both of these actors real strengths as actors, it oddly doesn't sink the film.  The X factor is Ian McKellan as Grail expert Sir Leigh Teabing, McKellan who clearly has puckish fun with the role.  And it is about at this point in the movie that the cumulative effect of all this alternative history regarding Jesus and Mary Magdalene, their protectors and attackers, begins to take hold.<br /><br />What can I say?  That sure looks like a woman in that painting by Da Vinci.  I know I've looked at the painting umpteen times, but it's true that the body language, posture, face, sure look feminine, and seems in sharp contrast with the male figures in the painting.  I don't know about all that other mumbo-jumbo regarding "V" in the painting - the female principle and God, but as a movie it works in a fun way, getting you thinking.  The chase aspect of this story however is clunky, and if anything makes the movie seem longer than it should be.  Character motivations are tissue-thin, and characters in general are cardboard ones, propped up a bit, as I said earlier, by very good actors.  However, the payoff at the end of the film is worth it.  And I have to admit, I was moved.  If nothing else was accomplished by this movie, the clearing of Mary Magdalene's name has at least been partly accomplished - at least more so than any vague Vatican statement regarding her not being a prostitute.  Howard has delivered up some real bloated junk food over the years, but Da Vinci Code, a difficult project for any director, is one of best his efforts.  3 and a half stars.</p></body></html>

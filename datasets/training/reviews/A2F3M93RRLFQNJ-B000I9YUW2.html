<meta name="summary" content="Forgotten...best forgotten"></head><body><p>Poorly written, poorly acted and poorly directed, there is enough in Forgotten to dissatisfy most people.<br /><br />The movie follows a mother played by Julianne Moore, who is still in mourning over the death of her son a year earlier.  This tragic event takes on an extra level of grimness when all records of her son begin to disappear:  except for her, no one remembers him, and photos, newspaper articles and other documents no longer prove his existence.  Either Moore is crazy or something sinister is going on, and when shadowy government figures get involved, we know it's the latter.<br /><br />In theory, this could be a good movie, but the story is executed so poorly that its potential quality remains a mere hypothetical.  Perhaps the most grating moment comes around a third of the way through the movie, when Moore visits a man who is the father of another child who died, but who cannot remember his daughter.  Fortunately, the power responsible for these existence-erasings - a force powerful and intelligent enough to alter minds and documents - just bothered to poorly wallpaper over the girl's room, allowing Moore to expose the conspiracy.<br /><br />There are other laughable idiocies: the government agents who have no idea how to arrest a person, allowing chases that could have been avoided if they were semi-competent; the police detective who - with little real evidence - easily believes Moore's tale of conspiracy; and so on.  Rather than relying on cleverness to move the story along, this movie uses dumbness.  In a comedy, this might work, but not in this humorless horror movie.  If you feel an urge to watch this film, find an old X-Files or Twilight Zone episode instead.  You'll be much happier.</p></body></html>

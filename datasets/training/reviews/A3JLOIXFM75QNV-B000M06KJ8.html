<meta name="summary" content="Well, at least the costumes were nice"></head><body><p>I've always disliked period films that take inspirations from the 21st century. It doesn't work and its annoying. Modern music does not belong in any period drama. Having said that, the movie itself actually has a very modern feel. But that is because Kirsten Dunst is in it. She is not believable in the least. However, I really couldn't get enough of all those costumes. Gorgeous and unbelievale isn't even enough to describe them. Probably some of the best I've ever seen in any film. At least the movie looked pretty. The barely-there plot doesn't really help it. It was just sort of an odd movie that happens to be visually stunning. I'm sure there are people that would love this type of film, but for anyone looking for a real film on Maria Antoinette, look somewhere else.</p></body></html>

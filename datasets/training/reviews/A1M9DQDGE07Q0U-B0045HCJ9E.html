<meta name="summary" content="THE WRONG MAN GETS THE RIGHT TREATMENT ON DVD!"></head><body><p>"North by Northwest" (1959) is Hitchcock's slick and polished cross country adventure meets `the wrong man' scenario. When advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken for an American CIA agent by the man he is supposed to be tailing, Mr. Van Damme (James Mason), Roger finds himself the victim of multiple attempted assassinations and a harried chase to unravel the mystery behind the insidious girl with whom he's suddenly fallen in love - Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). Fueled by an unmitigated desire to make "the" Hitchcock picture to top all others, screenwriter Ernest Lehman creates two of the most memorable set pieces in film history: Roger's frantic escape on foot from a marauding bi-plane, and, the magnificent climax - fleeing across the faces of Mt. Rushmore. Naturally, park officials would not permit this latter scenario to be played out hence MGM recreated the famed landmark on a soundstage using full scale sets combined with matte paintings and rear projection. The results are flawless and thrilling. The film also contains one of the all time blooper shots in cinema: seconds before Eve shoots Roger with a fake gun in the commissary a small child can be seen in the background clutching his eardrums in anticipation of the bang.<br /><br />* This is the same transfer as was made previously available on the single disc of "North by Northwest."  Through a meticulous frame by frame restoration effort, "North by Northwest" looks better than it ever has on home video. Colors are rich, bold and vibrant. Contrast levels are bang on. Blacks are deep and solid. Whites are remarkably clean. There are NO age related artifacts and NO digital anomalies for an image that is positively stunning from start to finish. Truly, this is one of the best examples of a classic restored to its original brilliance for the digital format. Certainly it is the finest example of a Vista-Vision film restoration out on the home video market to date! The audio has been remixed to stereo with a spatial spread that is engaging and does not betray its 50 year plus vintage. Extras include a very benign documentary hosted by Eva Marie Saint. It is incredibly long on personal thoughts and terribly short on detailing the production schedule. Overall, not nearly as compelling as the documentaries that accompany Universal's Hitchcock films.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="what's the point of this mindlessly exaggerated movie?"></head><body><p>the whole movie is a farce not even a melodrama. something funny but didn't bring out faithfully except exaggerated ten time more. the borat character didn't deliver a believable and realistic person but a would-be one. i didn't find anything that supposed to look funny but stupidly playing dumb and dumber with out-dated exaggerations. i've heard that russia has denied a release permit to allow this stupid movie shown in russian theaters in case to cause unpredictable protests and chaos to the people this movie targeted from. something wrong with the media people, they not only produced the 'jackass', 'dirty sanchez', they also produced this stupid 'borat' that i could never find it funny but repulsively disgusting.</p></body></html>

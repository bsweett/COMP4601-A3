<meta name="summary" content="A meaningful work filled with tastefully touches..."></head><body><p>Terrence Malick is a director who really does want to be anonymous... He is a professor from some distant university who is stumbled into the world of show business and refused to be seduced by it in any way... He does it his way, and only his way...<br /><br />To him "The New World" is a dream and he presents it in a wonderful way, avoiding the reality of history and avoiding the authenticity of it... It's one man's vision and he sees it with visuals and with sounds of nature... Smith and the little Indian teenager were very in love with each other and Malick show it very gently and beautifully in his film...<br /><br />Colin Farrell embodied the character of Smith, his age, his right spirit... He is an adventurer with energetic power...He gives a solid, believable performance playing Captain John Smith, the mutinous explorer whose mastery of experience and his inability to stay in one place, increases his desire to look ahead and explore new horizons, always wondering where he will be next...<br /><br />Q'Orianka Kilcher stands as Mataoka or Pocahontas, the incredibly strong young woman, obviously incredibly smart and lightning... She is her father's favor, very innocent, very playful, in touch with everything, in touch with the earth, with the sun, with the sky, worshipping the beauty of the nature... Smith was vividly drawn to her because of her ability to represent the beauty that's he never experienced before...<br /><br />Pocahontas was really looking for bringing two totally different worlds together and collaborating for peace... She was a big dreamer with wildly unrealistic expectations... Malick taught her how to act through silence, and she conveys what she was saying in words through her silence...<br /><br />Malick is an interesting director, and a great philosopher... He's just all heart, all instinct... His work speaks to the heart of the humanity... He's not interested in recording history but moving far beyond a simplistic love story...</p></body></html>

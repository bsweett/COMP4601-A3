<meta name="summary" content="Goodfellas stands on top out of all mob movies..."></head><body><p>In 1990, Martin Scorsese made a movie about a real life gangster by the name of Henry Hill, who rose to power inside a mafia mob family during the 1950's.<br /><br />Ray Liotta stars as Henry Hill, and the story revolves around him and his experiences at living at the top of his world, only to come crashing down due to drug use and illegal operations that led to his arrest by the FBI. This movie also stars  the brilliant Robert De Niro and the equally fascinating Joe Pesci as Hill's fellow mob family members.<br /><br />The first 5 minutes of the movie guarantee that you will never know what to expect, as a regular car trip by the three friends leads to a shocking violent ending to a man in the trunk of their car. I will say that there are more violent acts just like that, but that only adds to the raw, real story of the plot, which was a true story I might add again.<br /><br />Liotta gives a great performance, having him narrate gives us a look at what Hill might have thought as his life continued to grow better as he met the mob bosses and their families, and how he became a slick young man with a wife, a girlfriend, and 30,000 dollars in cash that he pulls right out of his pocket.<br /><br />The movie also shows us the cruel side of the gangsters, as they repeatedly attack their victims who don't pay money owed to them. But then they are shown as a family who always looks out for their family members, even if they aren't even related. Thats where the term Goodfellas come from: That they only invite Italians to become with them, because they were "Good fellas"<br /><br />Scorsese clearly shows just how different the families can be, going around showing the guys with their girlfriends, how the wives come together to gossip, and how just how rich Hill and his friends are when they take their girlfriends out on dates.<br /><br />Jimmy Conway, and Tommy De Vito, played by Robert De Niro [Conway] and Joe Pesci [De Vito] are shown as Hill's best friends, it was when Hill was a kid that he first met these two and they had been unseperable ever since.<br /><br />De Vito was the one that grabbed my attention, he was in some of the most funny and most shockingly violent scenes in the movie. From the funniest scene in which he is telling a story to his friends at a club; to him pulling a gun on a kid who tried to stand up for himself. Definately a show stealing performance by that man.<br /><br />Critics of mob movies say that this is the greatest mob movie ever made. Once you watch this I guarantee you will agree with them as I did.<br /><br />The second disk of this two disk dvd set also has some great features as well:<br /><br />GETTING MADE: Shows the documentary on how Goodfellas was made by both cast and crew<br /><br />MADE MEN: THE GOODFELLAS LEGACY: The filmmakers, including Joe Canahan, The Hughes Brothers, and John Favreau, comment on the movie.<br /><br />THE WORKADAY GANSTER: This takes a detailed look on the downside of being a gangster, from taking care of people, to being stalked by the FBI. Really a great look.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Robert De Niro [Who I almost forgot to mention was great also] Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, or Martin Scorsese movies, this is one collecters DVD you can't afford to miss.</p></body></html>

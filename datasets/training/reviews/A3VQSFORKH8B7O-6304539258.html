<meta name="summary" content="A CLASSIC FILM, A FANTASTIC DVD!"></head><body><p>THE MOVIE<br /><br />"Star Wars - Episode IV: A New Hope" is, without a doubt, one of the greatest science-fiction films of our time. It's combination of great performances, awesome visual effects, fantastic action sequences, and stirring music combined to create a tour-de-force of the sci-fi genre. George Lucas succeeded in creating a science fiction film that's not only believable, but full of emotion as well. You care for the characters, and are not just enthralled with the specatcular space battles. This is the heart of "Star Wars," and what makes it a milestone in the pantheon of American film!<br /><br />THE SPECIAL EDITION<br /><br />Unlike most others, I really enjoyed the Special Edition of "Star Wars." With the new digital technology, we got to see the full realization of Lucas' vision. Mos Eisley is now a bustling spaceport; the explosions are even more impressive than before; and the final battle at the end is truly spectacular. What's most fascinating of all is how the new visual effects from 1997 blend well with the older effects from 1977. Lucas only fixed what needed to be fixed, and it makes the experience more exciting than ever before.<br /><br />THE LIMITED EDITION DVD<br /><br />When I heard the rumor that Lucas intended to release the 1977 Theatrical Version of the film, I decided to wait before purchasing the films. And the wait was definitely worth it! Both versions of the film are presented with fantastic sound and picture quality. And while the extras are light, just the fact that both versions of the film are available makes it more than worth it.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />The Limited Edition 2-Disc Set of "Star Wars - Episode IV: A New Hope" is a fantastic release for one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. Even if you own the 4-Disc boxed-set, the fact that the original version of the film is available makes it worth buying this edition as well. As a "Star Wars" fan, I highly recommend it!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A+</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Family Film"></head><body><p>well time humor, great character personalities, and a well written script, and great directing drive this movie to become one of the best animated films ever made.  This movie plays a parody on all Super-Hero's. Where two super-hero's meet and fall in love and start a family of super-hero's.  But before that happens all super-hero's are band from public view forever, due to liabilities.  Then a bad-guy comes into play after several years of our super-hero family being in hiding, out for revenge against our super-hero dad, for rejecting him as a side-kick years earlier.  The super-hero dad then is trapped.  And our super-hero family comes to the rescue.  In the end everything is right again and our Super-Hero's are once again the Hero's of the day.</p></body></html>

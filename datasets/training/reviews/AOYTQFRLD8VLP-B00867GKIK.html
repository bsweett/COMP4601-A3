<meta name="summary" content="Wildly Imaginitive, and Wonderful!"></head><body><p>This 2009 flick is Pixar's most imaginitive film to date.<br /> In the 1930s, a wide-eyed lad with glasses, flight goggles, and a helmet over them named Carl Fredericksen(Jeremy Leary)sits before a movie screen in a cinema full of equally awed viewers, watching a newsreel featuring his personal hero, aviator and explorer, Charles Muntz( Christopher Plummer)have his career chronicled in an episode ending with his discreditation over a discovery he claimed to have made.Muntz vows never to return from the jungles of South America until he can prove his discovery valid.<br /> Upon leaving the theatre, Carl's young life skips merrily along, until, to his great surprise, he meets the wild, red-haired Ellie(Elie Docter), with whom the staid and quiet young boy shares a passion for flight, and develops a desire to travel to Pardise Falls in South America, since Charles Muntz is her personal hero, as well.<br /> Eventually, they grow up, and marry to the delight of Ellie's boisterous backwoods family, and Carl's elegantly staid family.<br /> They go directly to their dream house, the old boarded-up cottage where they used to pretend they were exploring in a dirigible.<br /> Over the years, Carl is employed as a balloon vendor at a local zoo, where Ellie works as a guide.In their spare time, they picnic on a hill and describe what they see in the clouds.<br /> After learning that Ellie cannot have children, Carl brings her out of her depression by reminder her of her dream to visit South America, and they begin saving for it. Their dream is waylaid by unforseen expenses, and Life's calamities.Life continues, and they grow old together. Sadly Ellie passes away  before their dream can be fullfilled.<br /> Carl retired to the house he and Ellie shared. But things will not be quiet for very long.<br />  The city literally begins to spring up around the Frederickson's cottage. Danny Mann's construction worker, Steve, working on behalf of his foreman, Tom(John Ratzenberger), unsuccessfully tries for the umpteenth time to buy the property.<br />  At the same time, a Junior Wilderness explorer named Russell( Jordan Nagai), arrives at Carl's door, hoping to acquire his "Assisting the Elderly" badge.Carl declines the offer, and diverts the boy.<br /> Legal trouble results in Carl's being committed to an assisted living home. Two male nurses(Donald Fullilove, and Jess Harrell) arrive to escort him to his new home.<br /> But guided by Ellie's spirit, he trumps them all by releasing a mountain of balloons tied to the roof of his house, which pull the house away from its moorings, to the astonishment of the nurses, of a little girl playing in her bedroom in her apartment  highrise, whose world is momentarily but gloriously bathed in an array of colors by the balloon's reflections, and by sundry townspeople.<br /> "We're on our way, Ellie!" Carl solemnly declares as he steers the flying wooden vessel, making his late wife's childhood imaginings a reality.<br /> He is given an unexpected companion  for the journey. Young Russell was caught on the porch when the voyage began, and while Carl is initially reluctant to let him in, the chatty lad is soon given a chance to earn his badge for assisting the elderly in a way he never expected.<br /> They reach South America with a thunderous jolt, and manage to tie themselves to the floating house as they explore the jungle.<br /> They encounter a rainbow colored flightless bird, whom Russell entices with chocolate and names "Kevin", and a mysterious dog with a talking collar named Dug (Bob Peterson). Once again, curmudgeonly Carl accepts the company of both, only reluctantly.But the companionship of both will be invaluable.<br /> The old man and the boy form a bond during their adventure. The widowered septegenarian learns why the young scout is in need of a father figure who will stand beside him when he receives his final badge.<br /> As they doggedly approach Paradise Falls, the spot where Ellie had dreamt of having a house, since childhood, they find themselves diverted by a pack of canines, who, like Dug, have collars enabling them to talk. The most notable of these are the Doberman, Alpha( also voiced by Bob Peterson), and Beta (Delroy Lindo), a bulldog, and another dog named Gamma(Jerome Ranft).<br /> The dogs'owner, as it turns out, is Charles Muntz, and Carl is delighted to meet his boyhood hero.But Carl and Russell realize Muntz's sinister designs on Kevin and must fight to save the bird.Despite Carl's initial refusal to get involved when Kevin is seized, Russell's derring-do forces him to act, ultimately giving the phrase, "Spirit of Adventure" a whole new meaning.<br /> In the end, we see how a lonely widower's life is renewed after loss, and how sorrow gives way to new adventures, new hope, and new joys, if we allow it.<br /> I would give this delightful fantasy the Ellie Badge.<br /> In the final analysis, "Up" is simply "Up-lifting"!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Disturbing and Wonderful"></head><body><p>Pan's Labyrinth is a beautifully made film.  It is also a very disturbing and violent fairytale.  Think back to the original dark Grimm fairytales that give children nightmares (NOT the prettied up Disney versions), and you will be getting close.<br /><br />This movie is an adult fantasy, and absolutely not recommended for children under 18.  It is extremely intense, quite violent, and deals with very mature topics: death, war, poverty, fascism, and human brutality.  Conversely, this film also takes us into a fantasy world that helps a small child escape from her horrific reality.  This bizarre combination ignites the viewer's imagination. It is emotionally gripping; we become wholly invested in this young girl's tragic life.<br /><br />This unusual story is filled with some remarkable acting.  The cinematography is graphic and stunning.  The film has an almost dream-like quality to it, which serves to enhance the brutality of the "real world" scenes.  We ache to see this girl escape - to be safe - yet, we know that she cannot.  At least not in the real world.  But, just perhaps we hope, the fantasy world can help her.<br /><br />Although very disturbing, Pan's Labyrinth is an amazing and unexpected triumph.  I give it my highest recommendation.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="FINALLY, A FANTASTIC "X-MEN" MOVIE!"></head><body><p>After seeing the first two films in the "X-Men" series, I was wary to see the latest installment. The first film was alright, and the second was just average. So, my hopes for this third installment in the franchise were far from optimistic.<br /><br />But, after viewing the film, I was pleasently surprised. "X-Men: The Last Stand" is, without a doubt, the best "X-Men" film so far. It has a great combination of action, visual effects, acting and storytelling that bring the series to a fantastic, probable conclusion, although it does hint at the possibility of future films in the franchise!<br /><br />While the film does have its faults, and it doesn't strictly adhere to the comic book, it is a fantastic film that belongs in anyone's collection of comic-book films!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A</p></body></html>

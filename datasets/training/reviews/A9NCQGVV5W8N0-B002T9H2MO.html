Living in isolation on the moon in a largely sterile habitat with only environment computer "Gerty" (voiced by Kevin Spacey) and the occasional time-delayed message from Earth for company is beginning to take its toll on Sam, but with the end of his three year contract in sight he remains chipper; until, that is, an accident on the lunar surface causes him to question his sanity, identity and real purpose on the moon...<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Duncan Jones' "Moon" because it is a return to the values of the golden age of thoughtful, philosophical science fiction films which appeared around the end of the sixties and dawn of the early seventies. Jones clearly grew up adoring the likes of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJ48SG">2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063UR1">Silent Running</a> and Andrei Tarkovsky's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006L92F">Solaris - Criterion Collection</a> as much as I did, and the production design, themes and pace of his own film is quite self-consciously styled after those films - all of which which were a) actually about something other than moronic hero cliches running around with with laser guns and b) used space as a metaphor for loneliness, alienation and madness. As with these earlier films, the drama in "Moon" comes from existential torment rather than exploding aliens.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the fact that Jones eschewed CGI in favour of model miniatures shot 'mise en scene' (with a little CGI augmentation) and kept it largely old-school. Personally speaking, models have always seemed much more realistic than CGI to me when they're shot properly. To Jones credit, he also doesn't allow the effects to overtake the film (in opposition to most mainstream sci-fi movies such as "Avatar", to use a current example, most of which really do just appear to be derivative nonsense designed to showcase the latest innovations in CGI).<br /><br />Performances are good. Rockwell makes a splendidly tweaked lead and Kevin Spacey is also rather good as the disembodied "Gerty"; He doesn't quite manage to pull off the deeply sinister air of detachment elicited by Douglas Rain as the "HAL 9000" in "2001", but then I suspect that noone will ever be able to upstage Rain's portrayal of a malevolent computer - definitive portrayal of a mildly disconcerting machine intelligence that it was.<br /><br />Be sure to explore the extras on this DVD as they're fascinating - and do make sure that you watch Jones' previous short film, "Whistle", which is included as an extra and which is a superbly offbeat tale of a hi-tech hitman having a crisis of conscience.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.</p></body></html>

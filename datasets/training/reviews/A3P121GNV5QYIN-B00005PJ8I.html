<meta name="summary" content="At the edge of the world, his journey begins."></head><body><p>6 years after the masterpiece that was Forrest Gump, Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks reunite to bring another masterpiece to the big screen.<br /><br />Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a FedEx deliverer who after a plane crash, fines himself both lost and alone on a tropical island. With either no or very little hope of getting home, Chunk must learn how to survive on his own, including doing his own dental work yuck and somewhat having someone to talk to in the form of Wilson, a vollyball.<br /><br />The film is 143 minutes long and about 80 minutes of it are just spent with Hanks on the island. Helen Hunt was good as Hanks's girlfriend it's just too bad she wasn't on screen long enough but she gave a good performance none the less. But this film belongs to Hanks, who earned his fifth Oscar nomination with his very superb performance and I can't wait for what Hanks and Zemeckis come up with next.</p></body></html>

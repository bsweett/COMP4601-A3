It is a small budget film about a road trip a family takes so that the youngest member can participate in a fancy competition. The film has an impressive start and by the tenth minute, all the characters are introduced in a very effective way. Then on, it is really the discomfort between the characters that helps the storyline proceed.<br /><br />I felt there was a slight miscasting since Greg Kinnear made me want to sock him in the eye. I mean, his character was quite interesting but there is this one dimensional "80's hangover" look on his face that doesnt do much to bring out the unpredictability of the film. Not in one scene did I feel surprised at what his character does. Maybe it's just me but please, how can someone with the same haircut (since As Good As It Gets..) get the particular role. I do understand this was a low budget film with limited aspirations but...<br /><br />Alan Arkin (grandpa) has a short yet mutilatingly effect cameo. His dialogues are to the point and hilarious, his quotes are unforgettable. I carried one with me after the movie ended. "A real loser is someone who's so afraid of not winning he doesn't even try."<br /><br />Coming to my favourite character, Steve Carell was very good. He seems to lend the film more purpose. His run is funny, his silent un-accusing looks, his way of hiding himself from his love, the fact that he plays someone gay so nonchalantly, his scenes with the character Dwayne and the grandfather were quite funny. He has this guilty look on his face as if he's an escaped convict of some sort. Funny.<br /><br />Paul Dano (the 15 year old kid) is actually 23 and his character was very interesting as well. My favourite scene in the film involves him and Olive in a ditch while the bus has stopped. He speaks in that scene.<br /><br />Overall, I feel Little Miss Sunshine deserves three stars because of how it doesn't dig deeper into issues it dramatizes. It doesn't have a huge scope and there is no one single OUTSTANDING performance. Paul Dano could have had a better role.<br /><br />The last scene is absolutely HILARIOUS, though.</p></body></html>

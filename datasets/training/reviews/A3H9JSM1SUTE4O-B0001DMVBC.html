<meta name="summary" content="TRAGIC ESCALATION OF ERRORS"></head><body><p>An escalation of errors propels the tragically compelling HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG as Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley duke it out over a house.  Beautifully acted, directded and photographed, this emotionally draining drama allows us to understand all sides of the conflict.  Kingsley and Connelly are mesmerizing and real.  Aftwer final fade out, the pain of this story lingers.<br /><br />While watching the film, some wiseacre said, "Maybe the Hulk will show up and help his girlfriend."  And I immediately thought of Kingsley in his Ghandi role and pictured the passive Ghandi and The Hulk head to head and lost the train of the movie for a few minutes.<br /><br />Interesting commentary from Kingsley but not Connelly.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant Acting!!"></head><body><p>This movie has some of the best acting I've ever seen in a spooky movie, not just by Kidman but by all of the cast. The storyline draws you in and I actually felt as if I were in that dark house with them. I guess many of the twists, I had the 6th Sense figured out right away, but this I wasn't sure of. I love it when a twist works like that!</p></body></html>

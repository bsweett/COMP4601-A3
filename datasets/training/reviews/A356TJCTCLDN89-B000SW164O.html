Robert DeNiro is a legend but he just seemed all wrong for this part. I never once saw him as a father and his character seemed to treat the daughter as more of an experiment than anything else. A lot of things happen in this movie that defy logic. If your little girl suddenly started looking like she's been to hell and back would you scratch your head and spend hours writing in your journal?<br /><br />The character of Elizabeth Shue was ridiculous. I've seen women move in on widowers before but this characer behaved like a she'd just found the last man on earth.<br /><br />When the twist came things picked up a bit but the climax and the little coda at the end were lame in the extreme. Hide and Seek isn't worth buying. In fact, unless your video store is offering a rent-one-get-one free sale, it's not even worth renting.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Anchorman is Immature and Silly"></head><body><p>This movie, starring Will Farrell in the main role, is a weak attempt at comedy from director Adam McKay. As much as I like Farrell from his Saturday Night Live days, this movie is a little too juvenile in humor and plot to make it a good comedy.<br /><br />Farrell and his female co- star Christina Applegate fight for attention in this film as they battle it out for the role as lead anchor on the local news. Farrell has held this role on the news for many years and doesn't want to relinquish his position to a woman. The movie is set in the 1970's- a time of feminism and social revolution- and the rivalry turns into a battle of the sexes between the two adults. This is a pretty standard movie formula and it could have worked better if the writing was more engaging and the comedy more sincere.<br /><br />The humor in this film is mostly bathroom- style and the jokes are primarily the types that appeal to younger kids. There isn't much in the way of original comedy, and what little originality the film can muster up is still juvenile and silly. In a matter of seconds, most of us could think of jokes and general humor at least as good as that offered here in Anchorman.<br /><br />Will Farrell is good in this role, and I liked Applegate. The addition of Fred Willard to the cast was also a good idea, but I would have liked it if Willard had a greater role. The other supporting cast of goons is rather lame and I can think of many actors/actresses who could have done just as well. On the other hand, the script of this film makes it tough for anyone to perform very well.<br /><br />Overall, Anchorman is a movie to pass on unless you're in the mood for this type of brainless comedy. Maybe if I had been in a more giddy disposition from the start, I would have liked this film more than I did. But taken as it is, this movie is a throwaway, with only a few drops of real comedy in large pool of manufactured laughs.</p></body></html>

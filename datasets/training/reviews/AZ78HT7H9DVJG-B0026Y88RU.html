So, I borrowed the DVD from a friend and popped it in to watch.<br /><br />Eh...I thought it was ok.  Don't get me wrong, it was a good movie.  However, I thought it would be a better movie if the pace had been a bit faster.  You gotta be wide awake and full of energy to watch this movie.  Otherwise, you could be lulled to sleep.<br /><br />The movie opens up with a gambling bet/horse race gone wrong, which resulted in some deaths in the '70s.  Then, you're fast forward to modern day time.<br /><br />Slevin (Hartnett) is staying with a friend, Nick, in NYC.  He needs a place to escape after he's been fired and discovering his girlfriend cheating on him.  Not only that, he gets mugged when he arrives to NYC.<br /><br />The problem is that Nick has disappeared.  The Boss (Freeman) sends a couple of goons to get Nick to answer for his debt.  They bring back Slevin despite his announcements that he is not Nick.  The Boss says that he'll waive the $96K debt (Nick's) if he'll do a job...assassinating The Rabbi's gay son.<br /><br />No sooner when he's deliever back to Nick's apartment that The Rabbi's (Kingsley) goons pick him up to answer to a $33K debt.  It just goes on and on. Poor Slevin!<br /><br />Meanwhile, Lindsey (Liu) is Nick's neighbor.  She comes over to borrow a cup of sugar.  She's real chatty, witty and nosy as she gets herself involved with Slevin/Nick's debt problems.  Through the whole process, Slevin and Lindsey fall in love.<br /><br />Back to the story, Slevin has to finish the job for The Boss.  He stakes out a restaurant, while on a date with Lindsey, and spies The Rabbi's gay son.  When the Rabbi's son goes to the restroom, Slevin follows him in and sets up a date with him.  This is where things start to get interesting until the end.<br /><br />Goodkat (Willis) is an assassin.  Goodkat might puzzle you because he seems to be everywhere and makes you wonder if he's a double (triple?) agent.  You'll get your answer as the story progresses.<br /><br />Like I said...it was a good movie.  I only wish that the pace was a bit faster then I would have loved it.  I do have to say that I loved the different, eye-catching wallpaper that is shown in just about every other scenes.  I'm sure you'll enjoy the scenery as well.</p></body></html>

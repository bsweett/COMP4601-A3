Sitting in the seat next to her is a seemingly pleasant young man (played by Cillian Murphy) who turns out to be part of a plot to assassinate the director of the Department of Homeland Security who is staying in McAdams' hotel.  The plan is to get her to switch the director's room so that the killers can get a better shot at him and his family.  As a way of securing her help, the assassins are threatening to kill her father if she doesn't cooperate.<br /><br />Although this is little more than a standard-issue potboiler, the scenes in the plane are reasonably effective at creating a modicum of suspense and believability, given the claustrophobic nature of the setting.  But once the jet lands and McAdams and Murphy start chasing each other through the airport and, eventually, all over greater Miami, credibility flies out the window and we're left with a silly little thriller that spins completely out of control and that provokes laughter from us in all the wrong places.<br /><br />Like the plot itself, the film stays airborne for awhile, then crash lands.</p></body></html>

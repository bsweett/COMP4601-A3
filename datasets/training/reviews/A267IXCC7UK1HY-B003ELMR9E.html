<meta name="summary" content="excellent story and acting, bad photography"></head><body><p>This is a taut, clever thriller where the detective plays cat and mouse with the criminal and vice versa. I would give it five stars but for the photography: a number of the scenes are shot with the camera unsteady--something that irritates me no end--and the narrative is occasionally interrupted with one-second totally blurry representations of the crime. (This is so gratuitous and irritating I am tempted to penalize it to THREE stars.)</p></body></html>

The cover art has it listed as a "Four Star Collection". Well it's only getting 2 stars from me for NO commentaries, NO deleted scenes, NO isolated score, NO trailers. Maybe Universal is readying a "Randy Quaid Gets Paid Special Edition" for later. Any way you look at it, this edition is anorexic. There isn't even a booklet or anything when you open the case. Is this any way to issue this film? I think not. If you have to have it, you have to have it. You should wait for a deluxe edition if you can rather than get taken / swindled by Universal and Focus Features.</p></body></html>

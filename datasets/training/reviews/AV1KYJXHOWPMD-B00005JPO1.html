I am a big fan of the first three, and while this is not as great as it's three predecessors, it totally rocks! The acting, cinematography, story, writing, and special effects are first rate. I recommend this to Indiana Jones fans. If you don't like it, that's all right, as we all have our own opinions.</p></body></html>

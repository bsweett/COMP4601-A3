Somehow, due to Kevin Spacey's over-identification with Darin, he had no objectivity and the result is a mess.  I watched it for about 45 minutes, really trying to like it, but finally exited it.  As many others have pointed out, Spacey is way too old to play the young Darin.  He sings allright but his moves are way too cool, too snappy, too everything icky...It was embarassing to watch this very talented actor descend into this terrible role.  He should have spent the money on good pyschotherapy to discover what motivated this obsession.</p></body></html>

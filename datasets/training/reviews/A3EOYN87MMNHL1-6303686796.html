I had a custom tape made from it at one time.  The story is a great psycho-drama with all of the players perfectly cast.  Jodie Foster is believable as the "baby prostitute," Harvey Kietel, chilling as her pimp and Robert DeNiro is so fascinating to study as Travis Bickle, wierd product of NY subculture of the streets and psychological textbook example.  It is, in retrospect, a brilliant example of post-Vietnam War 1970's atmosphere in the large cities of our country.  Maybe too wierd of a movie for some to watch, but a mainstay of the viewing repretoire of a true artist.</p></body></html>

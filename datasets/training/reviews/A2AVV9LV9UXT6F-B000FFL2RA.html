<meta name="summary" content="A very enjoyable movie."></head><body><p>Despite what other reviewers have said, this movie is not "Muslim apologetic".  Sorry to break it to some people, but Reynald de Chatillon REALLY WAS an out and out, thoroughly contemptible, rapacious brigand.  Guy de Lusignan may not have been QUITE as bad as he is portrayed in this film, but the real Guy was close enough as makes no difference.  In fact, he was so repugnant that the Knights Hospitalers did in fact leave Jerusalem rather than serve him (which means David Thewlis' character should have survived, as he wouldn't have been at Hattin).  The Templar grandmaster (whose name is not given in the film, but whose name, in history was Gerard de Ridefort) REALLY WAS a cruel, fanatical bigot.  Ridley Scott is not being unduly harsh in his portrayal of these men.  They really were evil.  Other facts to ponder.  The crusaders really did massacre the inhabitants of Jerusalem when they took the city in 1098.  Saladin really did refrain from returning the favor when he took the city in 1187.  The crusader army really did make an incredibly stupid blunder and leave a secure position, marching across open desert without water, and was utterly crushed at the Horns of Hattin on July 4, 1187.  Saladin really did spare Guy's life after the victory at Hattin, saying: "it is not the custom of kings to kill kings".<br /><br />The story is dramatized, and Scott and his writers made liberal use of dramatic license.  But the basic facts of the story are not too inaccurate, and the portrayal of Guy, Reynald, and others among the crusaders is not unfair.  Nor is Scott heaping undue adulation on Saladin out of PC multiculturalism.  Saladin really was known as a chivalrous and merciful opponent -- so much so that he was revered as a chivalric ideal throughout most of Christian Europe, despite being a Muslim.  This is not revisionism; it's accepted history.<br /><br />Another criticism I have read here is that this movie portrays every man of faith as evil.  I have to wonder if the reviewer who said that saw the same movie I did.  Scott doesn't portray all men of faith as evil; he portrays the fanatics as evil.  The same reviewer said the "atheist" knights were the only good ones.  What atheists?  Balian wasn't atheist.  He fears he has lost his religion, yes.  But he also torments himself as being unworthy, and abandoned by god.  No man would worry about being rejected by a being he doesn't believe in.  The Hospitaller, played by David Thewlis is also a good man, and a man of faith.  He is a member of a religious military order, is Godfrey's confessor, and states at one point that he believes Christ would not order men to commit the crimes that the Pope is ordering them to commit.  King Baldwin, admonishes Balian that he must ultimately answer to God for the things he does in this life, and it will not excuse crimes or wrongdoing to say that others ordered him to it.  These sure don't look like atheists to me.  The two other good men we see in the film, Balian's father Godfrey, and Tiberias, played by Jeremy Irons, never say much about their religious views one way or the other, so why assume they are atheists?  And finally, Saladin, in the movie, though not a Christian, is clearly shown as a man of faith.  At one point he weeps over the bodies of his soldiers who were killed in the assault on Jerusalem, and he prays to God as he does so.<br /><br />If you don't like the film on its artistic merits, fine, that's your priviledge.  But it seems that some of the critics are bashing it for political reasons, and worse, are doing so based on a very distorted view of the movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A fun film, where Steve Carrel steals every scene he's in"></head><body><p>Having just been thoroughly entertained by The Forty-Year-Old Virgin, I thought it might be fun to go back and watch Steve Carrel's supporting role in Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. Well, the good news is that Carrel is incredibly funny in this movie, sometimes without even trying!<br /><br />The movie itself is sort of a mixed bag. No doubt the producers are invested in making you laugh at its flat-out absurdity, but the silliness of it all often overshadows the clever irony. More often than not, Anchorman succeeds in its aim, but towards the end, the movie and Will Ferrell more than wears out it's welcome.<br /><br />Anchorman launches us into the world of `70s broadcast journalism with local San Diego anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) as the epitome of male egoism. His supporting anchors introduce themselves by breaking the fourth wall with all the casual gusto of their on-air personas.<br /><br />There's old cowboy Champ Kind (David Koechner) with sports, ladies' man Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd) in the field, and dummy Brick Tamland (Steven Carell) on weather. They revel in their boys' club in gleeful ignorance of terms like "sexual harassment" and equal rights for women, until new reporter Veronica Corningstone (a terrific Christina Applegate) comes to work for them.<br /><br />Improbably, Ron and Veronica hit it off until a series of events puts her in the co-anchor seat and professional jealousy rips them apart, sending Ron on a downward spiral. But the thinly laid plot isn't what's important because the story is just a vehicle for Ferrell an director Adam McKay to craft a series of increasingly absurd set pieces that highlight the star's ability to play the most ridiculous situations with an over-the-top childishness.<br /><br />On his first date with Veronica, Ron breaks into a jazz flute solo. In an otherwise normal scene, Ron and his news team burst into song.  For Ron and his team see TV newsrooms of the '70s as kindergartens. The high jinks and attempts to undermine colleagues are akin to children fighting over the sandbox.<br /><br />This bright comic idea extends to a rather absurd street fight among all the male San Diego news teams, which features achingly funny cameos by Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughan, and as a PBS newsman, Tim Robbins. Anchorman is at its worst when it attempts to make a socially relevant statement, and at its best when some sight gag or comically mystifying bit of dialogue comes out of nowhere.<br /><br />A lot of the film's best moments come from McKay's willingness to let the actors find the funniest detours in any scene and improvise. Ferrell, an experienced improvisational comedian, does wonders here, but it's Carell, who ably steals every frame he's in. Applegate is also riotous as Veronica and more than readily holds her own against the men.<br /><br />It's sometimes crude and juvenile and incredibly infantile, but Anchorman proves that even puerile humor can be funny. The film does make you laugh even if you hate yourself for doing so. A creation of former Saturday Night Live colleagues, the comedy plays like an extended skit with bits of improvisation and several slightly extended sequences.<br /><br />The behind-the-camera team has goofy fun with the era's truly awful hair and fashion styles, equally bad music and monochromatic TV news desks. Of course, the main fun comes at watching the era's stupid male chauvinism, with the realization that these men were pretty dumb to think that way in the first place.

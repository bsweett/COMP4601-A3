<meta name="summary" content="WILD WEREWOLF"></head><body><p>This is one of the first horror movies where the make-up and transformation effects were truly frightening and realistic, even though we've certainly come a long way since this 1981 cult favorite.  Director John Landis has helmed a whimsically humorous yet terrifying vision of the standard werewolf movie.  Originally chastised for its extremely violent climax in Piccadilly Square, this movie still remains a pretty effective thriller.  David Naughton eschewed his Dr. Pepper background as the young American who survives a werewolf attack only to find he is destined to become one.  Griffin Dunne as his friend Jack is fun as his deceased friend who comes back in varying degenerative stages to try and convince Naughton to kill himself lest he does more killing.  Lovely Jenny Agutter and austere John Woodvine offer fine support, but it's really Rick Baker's marvelous makeup that steals the movie.  The movie spawned a less effective sequel set in Paris.  This one is the best though.</p></body></html>

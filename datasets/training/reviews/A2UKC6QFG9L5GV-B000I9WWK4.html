And I guess noone will argue that it's the best body-snatching movie ever. We,ve seen a lot of aliens intruding our bodies and killing us slowly but these ones are definately the most dreadful.<br />Made not on a big budget "The Thing" (as many of horror movies of that time) still appalls you. Young director should learn how to make horror movies watching the best examples of 80's, and one of them is "The Thing".<br />Special effects will make your jaw drop, the cast doesn't consist of major stars but acting is just awesome. Because of those small rooms and surrounding winter storm you may suffer a severe attack of claustrophobia. "The Thing" is so real!<br />Besides there are plenty of bonus features on this DVD. You'll spend a lot of time exploring them all. 80-minute documentary is very informative and interesting. Not an edition to miss.</p></body></html>

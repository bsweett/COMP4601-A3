Ron Livingston stars as Peter, a computer software worker locked into a dreary cubical existance, suffering a condescending and exploitative boss and a meaningless life away from the job.<br /><br />Desperate for a change, Peter tries hypnotherapy.  When the session goes awry, Peter is left locked into a relaxed mode that allows him to cheerfully skip work, chase the girl of his dreams, and subvert the routine of his office.  A consulting team brought in to downside the company becomes the trigger for a fraud scheme hatched by Peter and two disgruntled office mates.  They spring the scheme, only to suffer an attack of conscience (and a fear of jail).  Their ham-handed  attempts to fix things lead to a fateful decision by Peter.<br /><br />The comedy of "Office Space" is in the knowing details, such as Peter's wearisome commute, in which the other lane always moves faster; the office gnome, laid off five years ago but still shuttling from desk to desk because no one told him; and a perpetually malfunctioning printer.  Jennifer Anniston has a nice role as Peter's spunky new girlfriend, while Gary Cole is superbly hateful as Peter's unctious boss.<br /><br />"Office Space" is highly recommended as a classic black comedy.</p></body></html>

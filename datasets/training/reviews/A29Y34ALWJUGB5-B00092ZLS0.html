<meta name="summary" content="Can You Say "Predictable""></head><body><p>Now come on, how many times does an ending like this have to be done to no longer be considered surprising. I won't say exactly what it is, but for those of you curious about it, I will say that nothing in this movie is ever surprising. Occasionally, the film-makers attempt to mislead you, but it fails every time. And it's so painfully slow that by the time the ending does come about, you're blinking through heavy eyelids.<br /><br />This movie's one saving grace was Robby D. Any movie he's in, I'm willing to watch, especially since, late in his career, he's trying new things. He succeeded with his furay into comedy; so why not horror? Sadly, though he did a convincing job playing the role of a psychiatrist who must care for a grief-stricken daughter, the movie just wasn't something he should have taken a part in.<br /><br />I could name a whole list of movies that has an ending similar to Hide and Seek, but I won't in case of spoilers. I also won't recommend buying this title since it isn't worth the money. Renting it, maybe, and be sure to watch it after a nap since chances are you'll end up nodding off while you wait for the horror part to happen.</p></body></html>

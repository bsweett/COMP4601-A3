<meta name="summary" content="Capable, by-the-numbers thriller"></head><body><p>I found it rather amusing to see this film--Matt Damon's first real foray into &quot;Jack Ryan&quot; territory--derail any of Ben Affleck's hopes of becoming a credible action star.  Although not as mysterious as it should be (especially when compared to the book), &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; has several things going for it, not the least of which is a brisk pace, and credible direction.<p>For starters, Europe looks much better through the eyes of Director Doug Liman than it did in Brian DePalma's &quot;Mission:Impossible&quot;.  Filming on location in Europe will always look better than on a studio backlot, no matter what the pundits say.<p>The action sequences are quite good; although they're more violent than spy thrillers from my youth, they're not as over the top as they could be, but still frenetic enough to appeal to martial arts buffs as well as fans of the original novel.<p>Another plus is the use of Franka Potente, who fits the role of Maria far better than any name, plastic-surgery-disaster actress from Hollywood.  At the very least, she and Damon possess far more chemistry than did Affleck and Charlize Theron in the tepid &quot;Reindeer Games&quot;.<p>From top to bottom, a crisp, by-the-numbers spy movie that will keep you entertained throughout, but I doubt this film will age very well.</p></body></html>

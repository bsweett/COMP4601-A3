<meta name="summary" content="The Day the Earth Stood Still.....Again"></head><body><p>The latest in a line of unnecessary remakes of classic films, TDTEST as I'll call it, is sure to disappoint fans of the original and unlikely to spawn a new generation of fans.<br /><br />Even with ingredients like top-shelf star power (Reeves, Connelly, Bates, Cleese among others), the proven success of the central narrative, and access to state of the art special effects, the film makers still managed to ruin the souffle. The main mistake is the heavy reliance on FX which, while quite nice, overpowers everything else.<br /><br />Neo, I mean Klaatu, arrives on Earth in a glowing sphere that appears to be filled with swirling clouds. The US military responds as it always does in the movies, by shooting first and then shooting the corpse again later. Connelly, part of a team of scientists, is dismayed to learn that her advisory role precludes anyone in the government from taking her advice. Naturally, she does what any widow with an emotionally troubled 8 year old step-son would do, she helps Klaatu escape and takes the boy along for the ride.<br /><br />By the time we are told why Klaatu came to Earth - Good news: it doesn't involve rectal probes, Bad News: He's going to destroy the earth - the movie is about 3/4s of the way through. That leaves just enough time for Connelly to convince Klaatu that humans can change, as well as to find a tidy resolution to her ongoing domestic problems with her step-son.<br /><br />TDTEST can keep you entertained for a few hours, but even with the nifty effects it is not a remake that does justice to the original. The lackluster dialogue, unfocused narrative, and meager performance by Reeves will keep this one in the bargain bin and far from the shelf reserved for "classics".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A World of Pure Imagination"></head><body><p>On the surface, the concept for "Bridge to Terabithia" is quite sad: it centers on two adolescents, both of which are lonely and misunderstood. They then bond and create their own fantasy world, one that reinterprets the harsh realities of their daily lives into extraordinary creatures and settings. It's very easy to think that such escapism isn't healthy in a relationship, especially in one that's formed during such a dynamic and turbulent stage of development. But there's so much more going on here, so many different themes, ideas, and commentaries that are at work. This is not a light and airy children's fable of princes and princesses, nor does it attempt to sugarcoat everything that's even remotely unpleasant in this world. This is an incredibly powerful story of friendship, the fortitude of the imagination, and the strength to overcome adversity.<br /><br />The first of the two adolescents is Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson). He doesn't exactly live an ideal life; not only does his family barely live from paycheck to paycheck as farmers, they also virtually ignore him. Going to school is even worse; he hasn't any friends, and he's at the mercy of a couple of school bullies. One sits behind him in class, yelling things like, "Beep! Beep! Beep! That's my loser detector!" Jesse has two forms of escape. One is running, which he hopes to perfect so he can embarrass anyone who gave him a hard time. The other is drawing; he carries a sketchpad wherever he goes, and he frequently fills a page with fantastical creatures of all shapes, sizes, and colors.<br /><br />The second adolescent is Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb), a free spirit in every sense. Because she was able to run faster than any of the boys, Jessie initially feels threatened by her. But then the class is asked to write a one-page essay on their favorite hobbies. The teacher asks Leslie to read hers aloud due to her fluid, descriptive language. Both Jessie and the audience immediately understand that the teacher made the right decision; as she reads an incredibly mature and creative essay on scuba diving, he visualizes what she's describing. Fish swim in his eyes. Bubbles exit her mouth and float away. At that point, the connection is made; she expresses herself through language while he does so through art. Both rely heavily on their imaginations. These two were meant to be in each other's lives.<br /><br />In wanting to escape the monotony and pain of the everyday world, the two run into the woods, swing across a rope, and create a world of their own. Leslie calls it Terabithia, a magical kingdom imprisoned by the elusive Dark Master. She and Jessie have been sent to free the Terabithians and restore peace. At first, Jesse has a hard time visualizing this fantastic world. But then Leslie gives him a piece of advice: "Close your eyes, but keep your mind wide open." Suddenly, everything becomes clear, not just for Jessie, but for the audience, as well. They incorporate an abandoned tree house and the surrounding trees and animals into their world: the squirrels and birds become minions of the Dark Master (interestingly, these evil creatures say things like "Beep! Beep! Beep!"); the dragonflies become the army sent to protect Jessie and Leslie; the trees become gigantic trolls.<br /><br />They retreat to this world as often as they can, despite the demands of school, family, and everyday living. This is something Jesse's father (Robert Patrick) has a difficult time understanding; while he is at heart a good man, having bills to pay and a family to feed leaves no room for an imagination. He wants his son to get his head out of the clouds and pay attention to his chores, his homework, and the welfare of the family. At one point, Jesse misplaces his father's keys; when they seem to be permanently lost, the only option is to replace them all and buy a new set of locks. This prompts his father to shout, "Why don't you just draw me some money?"<br /><br />Leslie's parents (Latham Gaines and Judy McIntosh) are interesting; like their daughter, they have active imaginations and spend most of their time writing. Surprisingly, having so much in common hasn't brought the three of them together. If anything, it's driving them further apart; her parents are always too absorbed in their work to notice her. This isn't to say that they--or Jessie's parents, for that matter--are bad people; I never once got the sense that they were willfully neglectful, despite not being as attentive as they should be. I saw them as people so wrapped up in everyday life that they've forgotten how to actually live. For this reason, Jessie and Leslie are viewed differently; their minds are transcendent.<br /><br />Truth be told, transcendence is one of the movie's most important themes. Consider the character of Janice Avery (Lauren Clinton); she's initially portrayed as a good-for-nothing bully, pushing everyone around for no reason other than because she can. She steals people's food. She charges admission to the bathroom. She unfairly accuses Jessie of things he didn't do. At first, we're not supposed to care about her. But then Leslie hears her crying in the girls' bathroom. After some coaxing, she finally works up the courage to talk to her. As it turns out, Janice is a deeply hurt soul, the product of an abusive father. I won't say whether or not this appeals to Janice's better nature, but I will say that the willingness to explore such an issue makes for a deeper, more satisfying experience.<br /><br />Despite everything I've been saying, I fear that this review hasn't succeeded in conveying just how amazing "Bridge to Terabithia" is. It's amazing as an examination of the connections certain people make. It's amazing as a testament to the endless possibilities of the imagination. It's amazing as a message to think freely and to not be bogged down. We need this kind of film in our lives, if not for the sake of entertainment, then for the sake of being emotionally rejuvenated. I find myself going back to Leslie's advice: "Close your eyes, but keep your mind wide open." Not only do I urge you to see this film, I also urge you to follow that piece of advice as you watch.</p></body></html>

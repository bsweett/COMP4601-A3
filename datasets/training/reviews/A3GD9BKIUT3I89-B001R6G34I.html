<meta name="summary" content="The 8th Wonder of the World"></head><body><p>It is not a stretch to say that every imaginative film since KING KONG owes everything to this breakthrough film.  Not in the least.  This is the first film of this type to have a huge impact -- not just with movie goers of the time but future generations -- in inspiring countless generations.  An incredible retelling of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST with it's poetic last lines, "It was beauty that killed the beast."  It -- despite progression by leaps and bounds in special visual effects -- remains a monumental achievement, one that Willis O'Brien would never achieve again.  Yet he did inspire so many generations of young people who saw the incredible wonder and dream of doing it themselves: Ray Harryhausen, Jim Danforth, David Allen, Jim Apeaperle (?), Roger Dickens, Ken Ralston, Doug Trumbill and too many others to name.  With stop motion O'Brien was able to give Kong life and emotion.  If you love fantastic films this has to be a cornerstone of any library.  Remastered to probably better than viewers saw it on the silver screen of the time and with insighful commentary by Harryhausen and Ralston, you have to love this movie.  It has been loving remastered for future generations.  Peter Jackson launched a HUGE remake that has some true moments but nothing can ever exceed the original.  Kong battling a T-Rex is still exciting.</p></body></html>

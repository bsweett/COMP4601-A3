<meta name="summary" content="Excellent film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages on two levels"></head><body><p>C. S. Lewis was a superb writter. I wrote reviews of all of his Narna books. This film is delightful. It is a pleasure to watch all of the characters, especially the youngest child Lucy who is the most charming. She discovers the magical world of Narnia, which can be entered by going to the back of a wardrobe. The country is suffering a perpetual winter because it is being ruled by the cruel self centered white witch. Fortunately, there is a prophecy that the great lion Aslan will come and defeat the white witch (think of the evils in our world and the prophecy of a coming messiah). He will be aided by four humans who will rule over Narnia. The four are Lucy, her sister, and two brothers. The book and film can be viewed on two levels. People can take the fable at face value and simply enjoy it or they can search for the religious sumbolism that C. S. Lewis intentionally inserted. Either way, it is a delight.</p></body></html>

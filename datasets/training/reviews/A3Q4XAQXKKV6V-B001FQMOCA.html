<meta name="summary" content="A good movie, but is it worth the Cash?"></head><body><p>By my 4 star review you would think that answer would be yes, right? Well, if we're talking Johnny Cash, the answer is actually NO. Being a "good movie" and a "good representation" are not one in the same.<br /><br />My reflections after the credits rolled were, that the movie was good, the performances were good, the movie moved, but didn't move ME. So much of the songwriting and band relationships were cast aside, and while I do appreciate the role June Carter had in JC's life, the movie made it appear as though he did nothing but stalk her. I can also appreciate the fact that the script could only be "so long" but how many 3 hour gladiator/super hero/against all odds movies have we all sat through that were TOO LONG? I say this movie could have been another hour (at least)and it wouldn't have seemed like it. In fact, Johnny Cash deserved as much.<br /><br />In many ways the movie seemed like a cut-and-paste story of any "rock star" and sadly, I expected more. "Walk the Line" is a fine example of heartfelt movie making, but considering the subject matter, should have been a lot more painful.</p></body></html>

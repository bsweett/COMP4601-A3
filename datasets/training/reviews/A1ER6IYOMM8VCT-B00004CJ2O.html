<meta name="summary" content="NOT REALLY THAT GOOD, BUT IT DOES OPEN THE DOOR FOR JASON!"></head><body><p>I am writing reviews for each of the Friday the 13th, but I own the box set and the older releases of the later two. The reviews are for those editions not the newer deluxe editions.<br /><br />The first installment of the series is pretty mediocre, but it does open the door for one of the 80's best loved horror icons - Jason Voorhees.<br /><br />The series is known for creative death sequences and not much of anything else. The first film features Kevin Bacon in an early role and like most visitors of Camp Crystal Lake doesn't last too long! Overall it's a fun Halloween flick with a memorable ending. I rate it 3 1/2 stars.<br /><br />The DVD transfer looks pretty good and the box set has some cool extras.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="AMAZINGLY GOOD 1956-SCI FI"></head><body><p>I was speechless when I saw this last night! The production values were lightyears ahead anything else at the time...  Every sci fi film is like a blueprint of this MGM film from 1956. Yes, it`s like a pilot for all subsequent sci fi films ..... Sorry, dear reader... my feelings are over the top now hehehe.... But in addition we have a good script AND good actors; I mean - Walter Pidgeon of Mrs. Miniver fame and a hero that is not really heroic(Leslie Nielsen)...????<br /><br />A MASTERPIECE</p></body></html>

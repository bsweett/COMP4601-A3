OK, I don't think anybody out there will call it "great," but it is definitely unique.  The type of person who will hate it, I think, is the one who has know love (or knowledge) of the pop-culture of yesteryear.  Let me put it this way - if you've never seen the original King Kong, you're not going to like this film.<br /><br />I was reminded of King Kong all the way through Sky Captain.  The film tries to capture the sense of wonder from depression-era sci-fi.  It takes place in an alternate history where the Hindenburg III blimp docks at the Empire State Building.  Everything is art deco - huge open spaces are the norm.<br /><br />It's true, the story should have been better - there is little dramatic tension because everything is so tongue-in-cheek, you don't really take anything on screen seriously.  But, in the end, this film is all about look - and it looks great.</p></body></html>

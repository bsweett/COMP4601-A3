<meta name="summary" content="You can smell the noir"></head><body><p>"Collateral" is, in it's own twisted way, a throwback to the crime/noir films of the 40's and 50's, even if modernized quite<br /><br />a bit.  The feel Mann gives the viewer of LA is chaotic, slimy<br /><br />and cheaply attractive all at once.  From the moment Vincent (hitman/sociopath) played by Tom Cruise jumps in for the ride,<br /><br />we feel the city somehow come alive.<br /><br />Never having been even a distant fan of Cruise, I can say he definitely comes into his own here.  Every second he's on screen you can feel the cold, animalistic cunning of a man who has<br /><br />completely sacrificed his conscience (if he ever had one) to<br /><br />the most evil kind of thrills imaginable--murder, aggression, death by numbers.  And, unfortunately for Maxx (Foxx's character), he is very good at the things he indulges in.<br /><br />Contrary to what a lot of other reviewers have said, I really think Jamie Foxx was the weak link here.  He just can't act too well, and in some scenes he seems so ridiculously out of place that the film threatens to turn unintentionally comical.  The one unbelievable aspect is that Vincent could keep this goofball alive.  He's a walking target.<br /><br />That notwithstanding, there are some unforgettable scenes, the foremost being "The Jazzman": Vincent decides that hey, since he's already offed a bunch of people earlier that day, he's "ahead of schedule" and Maxx should accompany him to hear some jazz.  We see the a somewhat human side of Vincent for a little while, enjoying the jazz, even buying the musician on stage a drink.  Together (along with Foxx sitting there, looking like a sore thumb) Vincent and the owner talk about Miles Davis, and how he played with him once.  At no point do we sense any real tension, just two men musing over a jazz musician they idolize.  Vincent than asks him if he ever "looked him up", or played with Davis as he was invited to. The owner replies no, and we see the existential logic flashing in Vincent's eyes, and it is developed later in the movie through Vincent's discussions with Maxx: if you don't go right after your dreams, you're a waste of flesh.  This is Vincent's poor rationale for killing; since people never really live anyway, they might as well die.<br /><br />In a chilling moment, he mentions in a sideways way to the owner precisely why he is there and who sent him.  He toys with him, and then shoots him to death.<br /><br />A few times Mann takes a break from the mayhem and goes on strange comcial notes: when Maxx's boss keeps pestering him<br /><br />on his intercom about going to see his mother, Vincent reasons<br /><br />that since anything unusual might blow his cover, they should go.<br /><br />When Maxx refuses to buy her flowers at the hospital, Vincent turns and says: "She carried you in her womb for nine months."<br /><br />The ending is an improbable turn of nail biting events which<br /><br />end in Vincent's death.  It fits with his vicious cynicism and<br /><br />general disregard for human life; he dies from a potshot taken by Maxx and lays dead on the LA subway.  This movie approaches greatness, but I think a Morgan Freeman or a more classical type actor would have been better than Jamie Foxx.  Worth owning, definitely.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another Pixar Smash..."></head><body><p>Pixar has scored again with this film, about a family of superheroes living out in the 'burbs. Like the Toy Stories, A Bug's Life, and Finding Nemo before it, this is a movie that I, as an adult, found myself enjoying alot. I loved Batman and Superman as a kid, and this movie conjured up those good old memories for me. This film has enough action and humor for any kid and even for most adults to enjoy, so if you haven't seen it, then waste no time getting it on DVD. It is a pleaser from start to finish.</p></body></html>

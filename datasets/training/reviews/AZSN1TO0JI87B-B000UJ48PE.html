So, it's only natural that a sequel would follow it up, and with the brilliant Eli Roth back at the helm, "Hostel" is back in business just a little over a year later. The difference this time? Instead of three fun loving dudes, we are following three very different ladies around Europe as they study abroad, unaware of the fact that they may never be coming home. The original "Hostel" was effective because it took time to build the characters. About two thirds of that movie were dedicated solely to exposition. Then, when everything went wrong, it really went wrong. I will admit, however, upon my first viewing of "Hostel," I found myself a bit bored, expecting much more carnage than was delivered (not the movie's fault) and wanting a little more action. This is where the second movie ups the ante. "Hostel II," for better or for worse, is a crowd pleaser.<br /><br />In typical Eli Roth fashion, his love for the horror genre oozes through in nearly every scene. Nothing can capture this better than the fact that "Hostel II" is standard, by the books sequel material. The deaths are much more intricate and involved, the story moves much faster and there is far more explanation than before worked into the story. In the process, however, the movie tends to feel at times like a remake of the original, with the first half feeling somewhat stale and predictable. It isn't until the first death scene where we stop slouching and start paying attention. And from there, the movie puts us through a complete headspin. Despite the fact that you can pretty much assume who's going to die and who's going to survive in this movie, it's still engaging when things go down, because they don't happen in ways you would expect. I'd hate to beat around the bush here, but suffice it to say, even if you think you know where this movie is going, you're probably wrong.<br /><br />The trio of girls are quite an odd mix. We have the relatively-unknown Lauren German playing the obvious heroine, with Bijou Phillips playing the stereotypically obnoxious party girl, and the underrated Heather Matarazzo as the mousy nerd of the bunch. Watching these characters onscreen makes one wonder why they would ever be involved with each other, and the actresses themselves ironically fail to shine until their death scenes arrive. One of the best and most intriguing scenes in the movie is one in which we see the clients actually bidding online for their victims. This gives the movie more of a human feel, and makes the torture scenes all the more nauseating, giving you the impression that even the average joe sitting next to you on a bus could possibly have the desire to kill you for sport. Where this movie really differs from the first is that we get to know two of the clients, the timid Stuart, played by Roger Bart, and the arrogant and abrasive Todd played by Richard Burgi. As far as I'm concerned, these two are the most interesting part of the movie, as both actors effectively play their parts, while delivering characters that are flawed, human, and unpredictable. Each character makes decisions at the turn of a dime that you may not have seen coming, but probably should have.<br /><br />Overall, it's hard to find fault with "Hostel II." Despite the critics ripping it apart, it is a fun movie. Nothing was worth the ticket price more than to hear the theater erupt during a scene involving hedge-clippers and two hungry dogs. It may not be the blockbuster, popcorn flick you go for in June, but it's definitely a movie you'll walk away from, talking about for hours. Sure, it suffers from a case of sequelitis, and sure, it ends all too abruptly and on a bizarre note (ala "Cabin Fever") but it's good, it's original, and it's a horror movie. Three things which don't seem to come together much these days.</p></body></html>

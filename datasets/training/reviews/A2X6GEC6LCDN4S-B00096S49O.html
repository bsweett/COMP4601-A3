<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Good"></head><body><p>This film had its very funny moments, even though it was dumbed down to about seventh grade humor.  Get ready for that seventh grade humor(ha ha).  Will Smith is a pretty good actor and it's fun to watch what his character will do next.  Kind of a formula picture, but it's good and fairly innocent fun.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What a disaster!!!"></head><body><p>I thought this movie would be fantastic with its all star cast of superb movie stars like Kevin Kline, Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin etc.<br /><br />Instead the movie was extremely slow, boring, and drawn out!! It was so bad that 45 minutes into the movie, I couldn't stand watching another second of it. So, I stopped the movie and promptly returned it to the video store I rented it from.<br /><br />If the movie moved at a swifter pace and was a bit more witty, then perhaps it would have been good.</p></body></html>

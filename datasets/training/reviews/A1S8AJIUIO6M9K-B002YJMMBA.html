<meta name="summary" content="Surprised Me, Not a Typical Sequel"></head><body><p>Although I tend to shy away from sequels, I broke down and bought this at Giant to pass time away while completing a tediuous task.  It was GREAT.<br /><br />There is zero babe factor in this movie, which was a disappointment, it could have been scripted much more engagingly, but three things really blew me away throughout:<br /><br />1)  The staging or the access to ostensible Vatican inside and underground areas--presumably not actually within the Vatican, this was all done superbly<br /><br />2)  The twists and turns and the ending were great.  I actually had tears of surprise at the end and will not spoil it.<br /><br />3)  Finally, Tom Hanks and the historical allusions still fascinate me.  It would be great if history could be taught so ably, but more deeply and more thoroughly.<br /><br />Absolutely recommended.<br /><br />To browse all 86 of the DVDs that I recommend, visit Phi Beta Iota the Public Intelligence Blog, each links back to their respective Amazon page but only there can you see JUST my DVD reviews.</p></body></html>

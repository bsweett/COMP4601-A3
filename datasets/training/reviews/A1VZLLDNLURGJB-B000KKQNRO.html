<meta name="summary" content="The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition) (2006)"></head><body><p>The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition) (2006)- I absolutely loved this five star movie and recommend it to everyone who loved the Dan Brown novel as well as those unfamiliar with the book.<br /><br />Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautouu were excellent and Ron Howard and his entire team did an outstanding job (of writing, acting, direction, filming, editing, make up, sets, CGI, special effects, music, etc.). Even the smaller roles were very well cast with an excellent international crew.<br /><br />Did I notice Lynn Picnett and Clive Prince, two conspiracy researchers (and authors of The Templar Revelation), make cameo appearances in the scene filmed on the bus? These two folks appeared in the documentary entitled "Angels and Demons". Lynn Picnett also appears in another documentary entitled "Unlocking DaVinci's Code, Mystery or Conspiracy".</p></body></html>

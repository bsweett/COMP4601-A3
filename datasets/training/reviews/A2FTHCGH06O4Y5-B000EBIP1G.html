I could tell something was not right in the scene in which we saw him from behind, but I was hoping my son wouldn't notice.<br /><br />But at exactly 1:29:01 (at least by my DVD player), that's when he made me pause it.  "Dad," he queried, "did someone take Aslan to the vet?"<br /><br />Sure enough, the lion savior of Narnia seemed to be missing a pair.  You can see this quite clearly if you pause the movie at certain points.  Sure, you tell yourself that they're out of view behind his prodigious tail, but you know you're just kidding yourself.<br /><br />No, there's no way around it:  everyone's favorite lion was somehow gelded -- possibly in a previous battle with the White Witch.<br /><br />Anyhow.  My point is that I don't much appreciate Disney's forcing me to explain the concept of a "eunuch" to my son at such an impressionable age!</p></body></html>

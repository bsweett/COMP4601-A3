<meta name="summary" content="GAME OVER AGAIN"></head><body><p>SAW III goes for the jugular, and it succeeds in being repulsively fascinating in its expectedly perverse manner.  The most disturbing scene is not one of Jigsaw's many games, though---it's the operation performed on his brain to remove a piece of his skull to prevent him from dying.  It's pretty gruesome to say the least.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, the writers seem to be trying to turn Jigsaw into some kind of mercy-seeking angel, trying to somehow justify his horrifying acts.  Sorry, folks...Jigsaw is pure evil, sociopathically immoral, and immune to the immense acts of torture he orchestrates with the assistance of his demented slave, well played by Shawnee Smith.  Tobin Bell is effective as Jigsaw, considering most of his time is spent in a hospital bed.  There are some horrifying acts of sadistic torture, and some good acting from Angus Macfayden as the man whose revenge leads him down a fatal path.  Bahar Soomekh is also effective as the doctor recruited to perform the operation on Jigsaw, or die herself.  Donnie Wahlberg and Dina Meyers return from SAW II, but they are merely torture objects in this one.<br /><br />SAW has had its moments, but the trilogy should stop now; it's focusing more on gore and shock than storylines, and even though you wouldn't think so, it does leave a door open for another sequel.  Do us a favor...stop while you're reasonably ahead.</p></body></html>

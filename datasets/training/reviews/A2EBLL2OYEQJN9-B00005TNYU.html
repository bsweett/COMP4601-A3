Is there really a need to recount the plot?  (A group of misfit kids embark on a treasure hunt for a lost pirate ship, battling some really bad guys along the way.)<br /><br />If only modern movies had plots as well-crafted as this movie!  I would label this as a family movie with the caveat that the children are a little older than 8 or so.  There is some foul language, but nothing that hasn't been overheard by little ears before.  The action (and the deformed chained-up beast Sloth) can be a bit terrifying to younger children, so this should be watched by the entire family, parents included.<br /><br />The Goonies is a movie about friendship, family, and the triumph of hard work when you really apply yourself to a goal.  It's the realization of every kid's fantasy.  Everyone will find one of the Goonies to identify with.  This is a must-own DVD.</p></body></html>

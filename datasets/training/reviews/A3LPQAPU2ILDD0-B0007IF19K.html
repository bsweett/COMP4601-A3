Jamie Foxx captured the essence of Ray Charles' mannerisms and speech so well, you tend to forget the actor, and seemingly believe it's the real Ray. Shows that intense true-to-life dramas can be put to film, yet without the perverse language and nudity. Some things are better left to the imagination. Well deserving of all the praise for Jamie Foxx, Taylor Hackford, and the entire cast and crew. Great DVD addition to my ever growing collection.</p></body></html>

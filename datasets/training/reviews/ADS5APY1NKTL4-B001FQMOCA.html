The film starts with his humble beginnings, picking bales of cotton with his brother and parents in the fields and gradually depicts his path to show business, after his term in service in Germany and his job as a door-to-door salesman.  While already married and with a couple of children, he encounters the recently-divorced June Carter (brilliantly played by Reese Witherspoon), of Carter Family singing fame (of whom he has been a great fan since childhood).  They are drawn to each other, and this mutual attraction intensifies as they embark on a musical tour together, along with a very young Jerry Lee Lewis.  This also takes a gritty look at Cash's descent into speed addiction and alcoholism and June's devotion to him during this, the darkest hour of his life.<br /><br />We hear some of Johnny Cash's greatest songs in this film (with vocals and accompanying instruments actually performed by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon).  These songs include "Folsom Prison Blues," "It Ain't Me, Babe" and "Walk the Line."  Joaquin Phoenix truly IS Johnny Cash, and you forget that he's even acting.  As for Reese Witherspoon, she earned a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actress, for her sensitive and beautiful performance as June Carter-Cash.  Their onscreen chemistry is sizzling and they are never hotter than when they are performing together onstage.  The whole film is a great example of cinema storytelling at its best--everything from the luscious cinematography to the great script is truly in a class by itself.  You will enjoy this film even if you aren't a Johnny Cash fan........Check it out.</p></body></html>

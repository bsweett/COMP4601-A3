<meta name="summary" content="Jaded characters"></head><body><p>The movie tells the story of Jenna (Keri Russell), a waitress of a dinner, Keri Russell, who is married to a good for nothing man, Earl, who doesn't treat her very well and takes all the money she earns. He is also abusive and controlling. She finds herself pregnant, a fact she is not very happy about. I guess she fears she may not be a good mother and that it is not fair to any kid to have a father like Earl, who made her promise that she would not love a baby more than him. A new gynecologist, Jim, is treating her and they start an affair. One catch, he is married and so is she.<br /><br />Russell's character makes really good, should-be-in-an-award-show-pies. She uses the pies to express how she feels at the moment and the events that are happening in her life.<br /><br />Russell's character wants to escape from her marriage and start anew.<br /><br />There is something about this movie that made me not like it very much: the over-the-top acting, the dialogue and the characters themselves. The movie was unconvincing, the dialogue was unrealistic and the acting wasn't great. The film, and the actors, seemed jaded, emotionally stunted and this caused the plot to not carry out well. Maybe that was the point of the movie, how to draw the emotionally stunted Jenna out of her life and have her start anew.<br /><br />Basically, the movie reminds me of the literary genre of magical realism in that it uses certain objects, events and people in an exaggerated manner. The pies, which are Jenna's outlet, her way of expressing her emotions in a tangible way, become an integral part of the story. We are told, if it was not obvious before, what Jenna is thinking and feeling. Thus, in a way the pies are an extension of Russell's character.</p></body></html>

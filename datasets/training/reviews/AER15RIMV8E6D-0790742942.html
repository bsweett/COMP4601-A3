<meta name="summary" content="A Gothic Tim Burton Classic!!!"></head><body><p>I thought this was a really good movie! Since it's a film by Tim Burton, you get a dark, depressing feel, and Danny Elfman music, and stripes. Michael Keaton, Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, and Winona Ryder all did a perfect job! Michael Keaton is hilarious and awesome as Beetlejuice! Adam and Barbara Maitland die in a car crash, they are given a rule book to go by on how to be dead. The Deetz family moves in, but Adam and Barbara want them out. Somehow, they're hot gothic daughter, Lydia can see them. They become friends, but they still want to scare them out. They seek the help of Beetlejuice, who is extremely obnoxious, and a bio-exorcist who tries to help Adam and Barbara, but he's too scary and obnoxious to leave and stop. The Deetz's bring Adam and Barbara back from the dead, but Lydia doesn't want them to because it'll torture them. Desperately, she asks Beetlejuice to help. If you love gothic comedy, you'll love BEETLEJUICE!!!</p></body></html>

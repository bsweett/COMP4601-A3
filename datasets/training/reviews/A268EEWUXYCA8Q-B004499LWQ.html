Part of the thrill, I think, people will get from the film is seeing "Superstars" acting dirty.  And you can certainly watch this film and get that thrill.  But, that's just the surface of this intense movie.<br /><br />I do think the DVD is giving people a false message with the review line from Times, "At last, a love story for adults."  Unless an adult love story involves backstabbing and eventual destruction of relationships, this isn't true.  However, I don't think that an "adult" relationship necessarily involves the harsh, harsh situations that occur in this movie.  A mature look at relationships, yes.<br /><br />In fact, what I liked most about this movie is the different perspective of love.  Most romantic movies revolve around a person trying to get with another person.  This movie transcends this idea by showing a period of time in the lives of four people.  Not only that, but it shows that love can sometimes be destructive as is evident in the way the movie unfurls.  It's sometimes hard to watch because you get frustrated with how the people act, but I give that as praise because the characters are doing what's in their character.<br /><br />Another interesting thing is that people will flit in and out of the four person story but we really don't pay attention to them.  I can't truly remember any characters besides the four main ones.  And what this does to the story is show that, to these four people, no one else matters.  They are so wrapped up in their game of love/war that nothing else matters, life passes them by.  It's kind of a morality tale in that aspect because it not only shows the destructive ways in which they act but also that they are so caught up in their own lives that they don't notice anyone else.  Very effective.<br /><br />The acting is terrific.  I'm not a fan of Julia Robert's choice in roles usually and was surprised to see her character in this because it's such a change of pace with her usual Runaway Bride/Best Friend's Wedding/Pretty Woman characters.  The dialogue is very explicit and frank in dealing with sex and might offend those not expecting it.  It's not a movie to take little kids to, that's for sure.<br /><br />There's not too much "physical" action in the movie.  Because it's based on a play, the action is represented in the dialogue.  What's interesting and sometimes darkly humorous is the verbal warfare that occurs between the characters.  Every scene is a war of wits as each character has an agenda and they use words to get to it.  These situations can become darkly humorous and witty as we see two characters sparring with words.  But this might be a turn off for some because, while there is a threat of violence that lingers between the lines, not too much physical action happens in the movie.<br /><br />There is a song that flits over the opening and closing of the movie and it really is effective in conveying a sadness to the movie.  The song, which I spent a long time trying to find, is "The Blower's Daughter" by Damien Rice if anyone is interested.  It's on the cd "O" which you can find here.<br /><br />As far as the DVD goes, there's basically nothing besides the movie.  However, the DVD is a superbit edition which has been mastered in high definition with excellent sound which is probably why there isn't many extras since the superbit takes up much more room on a DVD.  But if you have a TV and receiver to run it you will be in for a real treat.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie enough.  If you are interested in seeing an atypical Hollywood movie about the thing called love and aren't put off by a word heavy movie, then this is an excellent place to look.  It will frustrate you, entertain you, and make you think.</p></body></html>

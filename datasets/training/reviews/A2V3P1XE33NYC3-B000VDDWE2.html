After much deliberation, I've finally decided to review Roland Emmerich's "The Day After Tomorrow". I must admit I liked his work on "Independence Day". The special effects in that movie achieved the loftiest of heights, creating a truly mesmerizing experience that entertained even though the whole thing suffered under a slew of plot holes the size of the Titanic. Unfortunately, Emmerich decided to indulge his appetite for left-wing politics with "The Day After Tomorrow". The subject? Global warming, of course! It's the new religion for millions of idiots with sad lives who have nothing better to do with their time. I think the whole global warming phenomenon is a bunch of bunk, a pseudo-scientific con job bolstered with shoddy "facts" that appeals to the media due to its lurid, sensationalistic potentialities. This film does absolutely nothing to advance the idea of global warming. In fact, it probably hurts the cause in ways unanticipated by the director. Oh well. No global warming induced sweat off my brow. Of course, none of this means I wouldn't watch the film. I'll always give a mindless action flick a go, even when said flick reeks of far left-wing pabulum.<br /><br />I initially wept over the appearance of Dennis Quaid in the role of main character Jack Hall, a paleoclimatologist (say that five times real fast) deeply concerned about warning signals he's receiving from Mother Nature. Then I decided to forgive him and just watch the movie. Hall claims that computers tell him that a new Ice Age is coming down the pike. He tries to warn people at some conference, but laughter essentially ushers him right out of the room. In films, laughing at leftists means disaster in the near future. And sure enough, weird stuff starts happening. Like what? Oh, the usual. Snow in warm climates, heavy winds knocking planes out of the sky, killer tornadoes wiping out Los Angeles, a tidal wave and freezing temperatures engulfing New York City, England icing over, massive super storms sending temperatures plunging in the northern half of the globe. Like I said, the usual. The special effects showing the disasters unfolding are pretty cool. I liked the reporter in L.A. dying horribly as a result of the tornadoes destructive power. I hope he believed in global warming. The New York scenes work well too, especially the tanker floating through the city streets. Pity about England, though.<br /><br />Anyway, enough talk about the effects. Emmerich, having heard something about "characters" and "a story" somewhere in his career, tries to pull at our heartstrings with myriad plot lines both big and small. For example, Jack Hall's precocious kid Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) just happened to head to the Big Apple before the weather took a turn for the worse. He'll spend most of his time trying to get fellow student Laura (Emmy Rossum) to warm up to him (pun intended) during the time they seek shelter in the New York City library. Jack's wife Lucy (Sela Ward), a doctor by trade, spends her time weathering the disaster by taking care of a terminally ill cancer patient. Ian Holm shows up as a Scottish meteorologist long enough to turn the lights out in England. As for Jack, he foregoes helping the United States survive the storm in order to take a nice trek up to New York in order to save his estranged son. How heroic! How stupid! All sorts of threatening situations unfold, usually laughably, before this two-hour piece of propaganda shudders to a stop.  The conclusion plays around with the irony of Americans having to head to Mexico in order to survive the disaster. Awww. Ain't that a kick in the head!<br /><br />A laugh a minute, this "The Day After Tomorrow". It's less a film and more a collection of jaw dropping inconsistencies, cackhanded dialogue, and shock and awe special effects. I won't kid around about the effects--they're awesome and superbly rendered. The unfolding calamity is the only reason to watch the movie. The rest of what we see onscreen is, as my 8th grade science teacher used to say, dumber than a box of rocks. Are we really supposed to believe these super storms, the size of continents, could form this quickly? And why isn't the southern hemisphere affected in some way? How can the temperature drop to at least minus 150 degrees yet we see characters ambling around outside? How can you drive and walk from Washington, D.C. to New York City in these conditions, and do it in a matter of a few days? The answer to all these niggling questions, and others, is simply this: it's in the script. The almighty script trumps all manner of problematic plot holes. Maybe we should use copies of the script to plug the hole in the ozone layer, or provide shade for our rapidly warming planet. You got a better idea?<br /><br />If you're willing to turn your brain off before starting the DVD player, you'll probably make it through "The Day After Tomorrow" relatively unscathed. If you don't turn your brain off before watching, though, you risk serious and irreparable damage on such a scale that you'll resemble Al Gore for the rest of your life. Extras on the disc include a couple of commentaries from Emmerich and assorted personnel, a couple of deleted scenes that add nothing to the monstrosity we just watched, a sound demo, and a DVD-ROM featurette that I didn't bother to investigate. Not much for a "blockbuster," but I see a double disc release has also come out. If you really like the film, pick that up instead. Lastly, an aside: Sela Ward is the most gorgeous woman on the planet. Her presence in the film eased some of the pain I felt from watching such a huge piece of misinformation. I'm ecstatic that she survived the film and went back to her career in television. Call me, Sela!</p></body></html>

Some say it's the greatest film they've ever seen, others despise it.  What do I think?<br /><br />I liked Juno.  It was rather light and fluffy, to be honest.  Anyone who is expecting a realistic portrayal of high school life and teen pregnancy will be greatly disappointed.  The film is a little different than what you would see in a mainstream film, but not much.  It's not edgy, it's not out there, and it is desperately trying to be hip.  Juno's dialogue made me wince, like someone who is trying to prove how "out there" she is with her witty quips.  A lot of the dialogue felt forced, which diminished its impact for me.  Juno's character would not date (and never have sex) with someone like Michael Cera.  More than likely he would be the best friend who really loves her while she dates a jerk.  They would never get together.  The plotline of the jock who supposedly loves Juno is silly and completely underdeveloped.  Jennifer Garner's character was contrived as well.<br /><br />But there are some good things about the film.  I really like Jason Bateman's performance and character.  I think he gives the best performance in the film.  Many have made hay of Juno's knowledge of music and movies outside of her age bracket, saying it's not realistic.  That isn't true.  Speaking strictly for myself, when I was a teenager, I was listening to Miles Davis, Keith Jarrett, and ELP, which weren't popular at all during that time.  I also had a friend of mine who was 7 years older than me who I hung out with.  He got me into bubblegum music, which also wasn't from my time bracket.  So this does happen, and probably a lot more than people realise.  Juno's father and stepmother were pretty decent characters, far from the caricatures that permeate indie films like this.  They were a little too pat at times (especially the father), but overall their dialogue was better than know it all Juno's.  I liked the soundtrack too.<br /><br />The film is not a realistic portrayal of teen pregnancy, in fact, it makes it look kind of fun and hip.  It's a typical indie film that's quirky enough so that the audience thinks they're seeing something really different, but in fact they're just seeing something that's a little different from Hollywood fare, but not much.  We're not talking hard boiled Bergman or Breillat here, just a cute film that isn't boring or tedious.  It isn't painfully bad like Knocked Up was, but it still isn't a masterpiece.</p></body></html>

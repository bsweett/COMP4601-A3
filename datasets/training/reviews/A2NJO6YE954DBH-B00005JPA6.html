<meta name="summary" content="Do not think for a moment that "El Laberinto del Fauno" is a children's film"></head><body><p>"El Laberinto del Fauno" ("Pan's Labyrinth") is most decidedly not a children's film.  My wife chose it for our viewing pleasure this afternoon thinking it was some sort of special effects spectacular, comparable to "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen" or "La cite des enfants perdus" ("The City of Lost Children"), but this film from writer-director Guillermo del Toro ("El Espinazo del Diablo," "Hellboy") is not for children, even if at its heart it is a story about a young girl.  The time is 1944 and the setting is Franco's Spain, where 10-year-old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is traveling with her very pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) into the forest to a camp where her new stepfather, Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) is hunting down resistance fighters and passing out Franco's daily bread.  Vidal is an authoritarian sadist more in keeping with our ideas about Nazi thugs than what little we know about Fascist Spain beyond the toxic effects of machismo, so it is little wonder that Ofelia is so willing to embrace the fantasy world that opens up to her.<br /><br />On the road to her new life, Ofelia discovers a strangely carved rock and sees an odd insect that she thinks if a fairy.  This turns out to be the case and leads her to the decaying labyrinth and an ancient faun (Doug Jones), who reveals to the young girl both her past and her possible destiny (the faun never says his name is Pan or is called Pan in the film, but a literal translation of the film's title as "The Labyrinth of the Faun" would clearly have confused too many potential viewers).  Meanwhile, Vidal is continuing his pursuit of the resistance fighters, oblivious to the fact that he has an informer in his camp, setting up a fatal confrontation between the young girl and the man she keeps insisting is not her father.<br /><br />It is astounding to me that del Toro is able to entwine the fantasy and fascist plotlines like this, and the biggest compliment I can pay to his efforts is that each thread is capable of standing on its own.  I never found myself wanting to get back to the other half of the story and I was so engrossed in the film (and not just because I had to read the subtitles) that I completely forgot about the opening shot of the film when we came back around to it at the end.  My one complaint with the film is with regards to the character of Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), because I thought it was way too obvious what she was really doing and because she was a couple of minutes late coming up with the idea of using a knife to cut somebody's throat.  But there actually was an explanation as to why she would get away with it ("Pride" would be something of an understatement), and del Toro comes up with a totally fitting final punishment for the villain just as the heroine finds her own grace note.<br /><br />It is because of the graphic violence associated with Vidal's killing and torturing of resistance fighters that movie theaters in Mexico were putting up signs warning parents who were taking their small children to watch what they assumed was a fantasy film.  My wife says it is the worse stuff she has ever seen, but she has not seen the end of "Odishon" ("Audition"), and I can understand how people would show up to see this film without ever notice it was rated R, but now that I have seen it I can only repeat the warning that "El Laberinto del Fauno" is not for the kidlets.  This 2006 film is up for a half-dozen Oscars for Art Direction (Eugenio Caballero and Pilar Revuelta), Cinematography (Guillermo Navarro), Makeup (David Marti and Montse Ribe), Original Score (Javier Navarrete), and Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen (Guillermo del Toro), which is why it has to be the favorite to win Best Foreign Language Film of the Year.  I am surprised it actually came to the Zenith City, but even without seeing the competition I have to believe that all of those Academy Award nominations make this another category where the winner is a foregone conclusion.</p></body></html>

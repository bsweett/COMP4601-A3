<meta name="summary" content="(Blu ray update) 3 1/2 stars for the first Avenger"></head><body><p>Well, here we go again with another comic book character being made into a high budget feature film.  I suspect they will continue to get made until we stop going to see them.  The Marvel cast of superheroes eventually becomes a gang called The Avengers.  This film is about a 1945 young man who wants to get into the fight against Hitler and the Nazis.  Because he is small and frail, he is always rejected by the Army.  He is being observed however, by members of a small group of scientific government types as a subject for an experiment to make a super soldier.  He is Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and becomes The Chosen One (he he).<br /><br />The experiment works but soon after, everything is destroyed by a Nazi infiltrator.  We get a high dose of wizardry in terms of exotic weapons, especially from an ultra Nazi called Red Skull.  Yep, he has one too.  I really liked that.  Assuming you can get past the re-creation of WW II, "CA" has much to offer.  First, the retro look of the film is a welcome departure from the more futuristic style of most films of this ilk.  Like the "X-Men" prequel of a few months ago, the acting is very good.  Chris Evans in particular is well suited to this role.  He gives Rogers/Capt. America a nice guy/Superman image, complete with a sense of humor.  Does this film rank as one of the best of the genre?  Well, not quite.  It's better than the "Greens" but not as good as "Thor" or the aforementioned "X-Men".<br /><br />1-2-12: Blu ray update - The DTS HD Master Audio soundtrack is excellent with window rattling explosions but also subtle enough to show off the score from Alan Silvestri.  This 2-D version is also visually excellent.  The package comes with numerous featurettes, commentary tracks, deleted scenes and 5 trailers.</p></body></html>

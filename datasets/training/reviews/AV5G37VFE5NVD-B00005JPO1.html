This is a special case, though, because it's not just any 64-year-old man picking up his hat, and it's not just any hat, either.  It's Dr. Henry "Indiana" Jones, Jr., and he's picking up his trademark fedora, easily the most iconic hat in cinematic history.  After nearly twenty years of waiting, Indiana Jones has returned for his fourth adventure: "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."<br /><br />A lot has happened since we last joined Indy for an adventure.  Off-screen, that was 1989.  On-screen, it was 1938.  Indy was still young and devilishly handsome, and though he was still having run-ins with Nazis, America wasn't involved in World War II yet.  It's painful to realize that in the time it took for "Crystal Skull" to arrive, we missed all of the 1940s, including Indy's involvement with World War II (which would certainly have been something to see), and most of the 1950s.  (That doesn't include Harrison Ford's brief guest-stint as a fifty-year-old Indiana Jones on "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles" in 1993.)  In "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," set in 1957, Indy is getting up there in age, and the Cold War is in full swing.<br /><br />That means that, inevitably, a lot of the so-called fans of the series' previous entries will not be pleased with the new film.  They would like the Indy they grew up: a young, dashing, restless womanizer.  Those fans are living in Neverland.  There's no way "Crystal Skull" will satisfy them, because it's not another adventure of Indiana Jones in the 1930s.  Hard as it to accept - and it seems to be harder for some people to accept than others - there will never be another one of those.  They're over.  Those fans have grown older, and their hero has too.  Those people who go into the theatre expecting a fourth 1930s-style Indiana Jones movie will be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />Those who seek a new Indiana Jones movie, on the other hand, needn't worry.  The same smug, wisecracking, clever, and very human American hero that we know and love is back.  If anything, "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is a savage attack on ageism.  Yeah, Indy's joints are a little creakier than they used to be, but he can still run with the best of them.  And I mean run.  Watch Harrison Ford move in this movie.  This guy is 64 years old!  (And before you say "stunt double," Ford did an enormous amount of his own stunts.)  At Ford's request (!), screenwriter David Koepp inserted a number of jokes about Indy's age into the film, to acknowledge the fact that the Man with the Hat has added a few rings to his tree since last we saw him.  The filmmakers don't pretend that Indy hasn't aged, but they try (successfully) to accentuate the fact that that doesn't mean a darn thing.<br /><br />And it really doesn't.  Harrison Ford is as spectacular as he's ever been.  He has the same mischievous twinkle in his eye - watch for it in the opening sequence, you can see it - and the same charming grin.  He's in excellent shape for his age, since, according to Ford, he's been trying to stay in shape for another Indiana Jones movie since they filmed the last one (George Lucas' original deal with Paramount stated that five films would be produced).  Seeing Ford in the opening of the film is enough to transform the most masculine of adult males into the same bleary-eyed little boy they were when they saw the original film, "Raiders of the Lost Ark," back in '81.  Indy has grown up with us, fortunately.  Though he does have a love interest in the film, it's an old flame.  He's not running around with women half his age (unlike his real-life counterpart, Mr. Ford, who has been in a highly-publicized and apparently very happy relationship with "Ally McBeal" star Calista Flockhart for the last decade).  He's learned a bit from his past adventures, too.  He is only a few steps from being the same sort of wise old man his father was in "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," a fact referred to by a very clever allusion to "Last Crusade" around the middle of the film.<br /><br />Though Ford's aging shoulders prove more than sturdy enough to support the film, he has a supporting cast as colorful as his adventures.  It's really a delight to see Karen Allen, who was a prominent and very well-liked actor from her first major role, in 1978's "Animal House," until the release of "Scrooged" in 1988.  Many Indy fans have long held that Allen's character from "Raiders" was Indiana Jones' one true love, and those people will be jumping out of their seats and whipping on to the theater's fans when they see how wonderfully the filmmakers have treated Allen in this film.  The chemistry between she, Ford, and Shia LeBouf - yes, he's in this one, there's no escaping him in blockbusters now - is surprising.<br /><br />LeBouf is a pleasure.  He provides a lot of the comic relief, which he does with the same natural grace which has made him the hottest young actor in Hollywood.  Steven Spielberg has taken a lot of flak for dressing LeBouf up as a "painfully obvious" homage to Marlon Brando in "The Wild One," but it works.  It's funny, it's a nice little wink to that picture, and that's all it's supposed to be.<br /><br />The highlight of the supporting cast is Cate Blanchett.  Are you surprised?  Blanchett's portrayal of unstoppable and determined Russian agent Irina Spalko, clearly based upon the character of Rosa Klebb from "From Russia with Love," is hilarious, intriguing, and right on the spot.  If one desires anything more from the cast, it's that her role had been expanded.<br /><br />As for the film itself, well, if there's anything wrong with it, it's the script.  The rough story, concocted by George Lucas, is interesting.  The script, on the other hand, is pieced together from previous scripts by writers like Jeff Nathanson (who receives story credit with Lucas) and, more than anyone else, Frank Darabont (the man who brought us "The Shawshank Redemption" and "The Green Mile"), and it shows.  David Koepp, who also crafted the scripts for everything from "Jurassic Park" to "Spider-Man," tries his best, but his script is ultimately sort of a Frankenstein's monster, full of great ideas and great scenes that don't quite slide together into one cohesive whole, and filled with some very questionable dialogue.  Oh, if only they'd gone with Darabont's script!  Word on the street is it was brilliant; Spielberg reportedly was head-over-heels crazy about it.  Koepp's script isn't bad, it just goes off occasionally, and when it does, it's enough to throw one off for a minute.<br /><br />Spielberg's directing won't throw anybody off, though.  Those pesky nihilists who have been crying like banshees that Spielberg's lost it should be silenced by this movie.  Spielberg shoots just like he did in the `80s, back when no one was shooting better.  Surprisingly, he shines the most in the action sequences, which are incredible.  They are by far the most exciting action sequences this side of the millennium (yes, better than those in the damn "Pirates of the Caribbean" movies!).  They're also some of the most over-the-top, a trait Spielberg recognizes and even exploits.  Among the sequences: Indiana Jones battles Russians in Area 51, is chased by KGB agents through his college campus, and survives a nuclear blast by hiding in a led-lined refridgerator.<br /><br />If you're thinking this all sounds like hogwash, this isn't the film for you.  The only problem with this movie is that people seem to be expecting something deep or even something realistic, like Spielberg's last movie, "Munich."  That's exactly what the Indiana Jones movies are NOT about.  These films were created by George Lucas as homages to the five-minute serials of the 1930s, or ridiculous old Charlton Heston adventures.  They're meant to be over-the-top, they're meant to be colorful, they're meant to be silly and unbelievable.  They exist for one sole reason: to entertain.  And if one realizes that, one comes to realize that these movies are brilliant.<br /><br />After all, the Indiana Jones movies are widely regarded as the greatest action-adventure series in cinematic history.  Expectations aren't necessarily too high for this film, they're just off the mark.  The characters have aged and even grown, but anyone who expects anything deeper than the previous films best turn right around and rent "Youth Without Youth."  The cast is superb, Spielberg is at his finest, and, in his mid-60's, Indiana Jones still can whip with the best of them.  What more could you ask for?</p></body></html>

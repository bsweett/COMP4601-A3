<meta name="summary" content="Crowe Masters"></head><body><p>Over the years, there have been many films set on board sailing vessels.  None, however, catch the mood of ship board life as well as "Master and Commander".<p>I would expect this film to rate well in the forthcoming Oscars.  Crowe's role is absolutely dominant. He is truly the master and commander in this seafaring epic.<p>I have been told that the original book involved an American ship as the "baddies" but, to sell the story to the US market, a French ship was put in its place.  This has no impact on the overall film which is quite awe inspiring.<p>Peter Weir's direction of the film is magnificent.  The on board scenes with the rigging creaking and the ship rolling are totally believable.  There is also a "cameo role" for the Galapagos Islands where the ship's doctor moves to within a whisker of scooping Darwin.  <p>I recommend this film to all ages and sexes.  It is seemingly an all boys story that manages to appeal to everyone.</p></body></html>

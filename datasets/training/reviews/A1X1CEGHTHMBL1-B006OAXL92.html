<meta name="summary" content="A young boy works on what motivates him and an old man has lost his!"></head><body><p>This movie is a classic film.  It is wonderfully scripted, directed and performed.  Hugo (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan who lives in a train station.  He was taken there by his uncle who took him in so he could work for free fixing the clocks at the station.  Hugo is a street person who lives by his wits and his ability to steal what he needs to survive.  His uncle disappears and Hugo is really on his own.<br /><br />His favorite project is to rebuild an automaton that his father rescued from a fire before his death.  He is constantly stealing parts for the repair work.  While taking parts from an old clock/toy maker he is caught and the old man steals his notes and refuses to return them...<br /><br />The old man, Georges Melies, is played by Ben Kingsley and the performance is top notch.  The direction by Martin Scorsese is so good that this is one of his best films.  The movie is a sleeper as it did not do well at the box office but we loved it.  We watched it with our grandson and even he liked it.<br /><br />This is a very good story and you should get it to watch with the family!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Open Range - A brilliant western!"></head><body><p>&quot;Open Range&quot; is an incredibly poetic, simple, yet complex film that is extremely entertaining on all points.  It has probably been since the release of &quot;Unforgiven&quot; that I've watched a new western and enjoyed it this much!  Few films in today's era go so far as &quot;Open Range&quot; does as far as character and plot development, fearing that they would bore the audience to death which may well be true for many other films but it works perfectly in this exceptional movie, flawlessly building up the suspense for the ultimate conclusion of the film.<p>I would definitely have to say it has also been a long time since I've watched a film with Kevin Costner in it that I've enjoyed this much as well.  I wouldn't go so far as to say, with this one film, that he's back but this film makes a very good start at him showing the depth of his acting abilities once again.  The true star of this exceptional film is Robert Duvall.  He is a true star in all genres but he shines even brighter when it's time to don a role in a western movie.  Then there's Annette Bening, an actress of true beauty who has always been such a special influence on every film she takes up and with this role, she once again vividly displays why she is a film star.<p>Along with the starring role, Kevin Costner takes the nod for producing and more importantly, directing this intriguingly captivating movie.  I would have to say that of the movies he's directed so far that I've watched this was his best effort in the director's seat.<p>The Premise:<p>Welcome to the open range of America during the year of 1882.  This impressive film opens up to a beautiful vista of open grazing land and we're introduced to our primary characters in Boss (Robert Duvall) and Charlie (Kevin Costner) who are free grazers, which are cowboys who drive their herds on the open plains.  Along with them are two younger cowboys in Mose (Abraham Benrubit, &quot;ER) and Button (Diego Luna).  When they find they need some additional supplies, they send Mose back to the last town they came through and when a couple days go by without his return they decide that they must go back to find out what happened to him.  Not long after they arrive in the small western town they find that Mose had been in a fight and was brutally beaten despite having dished out some to his attackers as well.  They're warned away from the town by a local rancher who has the sheriff under his belt...<p>What follows from there is, for the better part, a melodramatic western with an exhilarating ending that is particularly captivating.  I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of the western genre!  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>-Audio Commentary with Kevin Costner<br />-&quot;America's Open Range&quot; A historical journey back in time to the real open range of the 1800s, narrated by Kevin Costner<br />-&quot;Beyond Open Range&quot; Director's Journal<br />-Deleted Scenes<br />-&quot;Storyboarding:  Open Range&quot;<br />-Music Video Montage</p></body></html>

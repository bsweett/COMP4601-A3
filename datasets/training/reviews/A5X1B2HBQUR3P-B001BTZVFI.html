<meta name="summary" content="The movie does not take itself seriously"></head><body><p>A resonable start to the fantastic 4 franchise. The movie is directed well but not as good as the Xmen series . The worst thing about this movie is the soundtrack. The theme music is awful for lack of a better word. The direction by Tim Story is not as good as other super hero movie directors Sam Riami (Spiderman1,2,3), Bryan Singer (Xmen1,2) and Brett Ratner (Xmen3). The problem with 4 unlike xmen and spiderman is that this is one marvel series which stretches things quite a bit and requires a lot of tolerant imagination if you want to move it from a comic book to film. Although the idea of a rubber like stretchy man, a rock man (the thing), a human torch man who can go up in flames/travel at mach3 and a woman who becomes invisible lends itself well to the comic book universe, doing this on a movie screen is very tricky. To do so the director must employ a kind of real world seriousness to the movie like done in xmen and spiderman. The movie must take itself very seriously . These super heros are intrinsically slighly tougher for movie medium to be taken seriously and this gets in the way of the film. This one was atleast ok but the next one : rise of the silver surfer was a complete joke. This series is loosing out because the screenplay has to adapt a certain practicality, logic and plausibility when converting it from comic book to movie and that is not happening. You can't lift the comic book as it is without making changes and hope to make it work as a piece of film where you are going to have the non die hard fantastic 4 and the non die hard comic book fans also viewing the movie.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></body></html>

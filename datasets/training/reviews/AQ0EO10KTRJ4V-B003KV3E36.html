<meta name="summary" content="Should be required viewing for all Americans"></head><body><p>RAMBO (2008) should be mandatory viewing for all citizens in the United States ?<br /><br />Why do I say this ?<br /><br />We as a society have had it so good for so long that too many of our people take our quality of life for granted today and thus sit back with apathy as warning signs pop up in front of us everyday that the America we loved and respected and was once great.... is eroding away from within every day.<br /><br />It's depressing to see this once great nation rot from within like the Roman Empire did before us.<br /><br />Along these lines, too many American citizens today know almost nothing about the world beyond AMERICAN IDOL and GREYS ANATOMY TV shows.<br /><br />No lie....... when my wife and I were leaving the theatre after seeing RAMBO (2008) a group of 30-something adults were walking in front of us.....<br />They commented to each other.....<br />"Is Burma a real country or did they make that up for the movie ?"<br /><br />YIKES.... we let people like this actually vote !<br /><br />Many people focus only on the violence in this film and perhaps miss the larger symbolism that Stallone often interjects into his films.<br /><br />Rambo, like many of us in our late 40s and older see people in power making the same mistakes, people becoming less thoughtful and considerate of others and basically see the damage caused by open door immigration and unchecked urban growth.<br /><br />It all seems to prove the old adage to be more true than ever........<br /><br />"Its a shame man's moral and social development fails to keep pace with his technological advances".<br /><br />RAMBO reminds us of the type of integrity and determination and self-analysis real heroes and leaders go thru in life.<br /><br />Unfortunately we see little of these noble characteristics in either cinema or real-life anymore.<br /><br />The fact that a 61 year old action hero can outshine and ourperform today's modern "heroes" like Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt on the screen is also a parrallel commentary on where our society is today.<br /><br />We don't have many John Waynes, Charles Bronsons, Clint Eastwoods, or Stallones in our society today.<br /><br />Instead we have limp "dish-rags" and decadent morals and wimpbaits who like to cry, whine, gripe and complain about things but never want to step up and actually fix or solve any problems.<br /><br />Where have all the leaders gone ?<br />We certainly don't have any running for President in 2008 for example.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Bit Choppy..."></head><body><p>The overall story of this film is great, with great dialogue, interesting characters. Somewhat strange character in Julianne Moore...I was just waiting for her to do something really strange, but it never happened!! With this deep movie, the viewer really has to stay focused, and think.  This is a film that has really good intentions, but is very choppy. As soon as you get used to one idea, the whole story changes, and you basically have to wait till the end for the complete story to be pulled together.  Some suprises...very interesting!</p></body></html>

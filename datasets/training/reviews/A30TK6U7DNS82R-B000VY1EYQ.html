Maybe if I liked pies more, I would enjoy the endless shots of pies being made, nut they needed a better food stylist here if they were going to spend reels of film pouring viscous mounds of goo from a bowl held high above the table into the waiting piecrust below.  Repeat, ad infinitum, add voiceover explaining that this was "Jenna's Feeling Bad Today Pie" or "Jenns Needs a New Sparkplug in her Love Life Pie."  The cutesy names did it for me.  I could not fully appreciate the simplicities of the story, nor the occasional good acting.<br /><br />I saw this on the heels of THE LAST PICTURE SHOW and this could not help but see some similarities between the two films.  You have the ignored wife, the callous husband, the tiny town where everyone knows your business.  In TLPS you had Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) a crusty old curmudgeon of a diner owner whose bequest changes the lives of everyone around him.  And here you have Andy Griffith, going through the Sam the Lion playbook without even a single change of dialogue, well, practically.  Never mind, it's a great old part, and somebody should be playing it in every movie.<br /><br />I can see why the actors wants to participate.  I'm not even an actor, but even I would pay good money to be able to play in one of those scenes in which the two principals who hate each other part angrily, and then in a doubletake a moment later, the madder one turns around and marches to the other and kisses him/her with all the pentup list the screen will allow.  It's in every Sundance movie, but why doesn't it happen this way in real life?</p></body></html>

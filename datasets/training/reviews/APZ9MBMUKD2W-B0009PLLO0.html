The man went out and basically took over a huge chunk of the known old world. He was one hell of a soldier and General. But He also wound up as a monster and a tryant who had lost his soul in the loneliness and madness of being an absolute monarch. Who was probadly was poisoned by his nobles in Bagdad as they were terrified of him.<br />  Also his conquest helped fianance the Hellenistic Age which established Greek Culture as one of the Pillars of Western Civilisation. That would of been nice to mention in the film. Or the establishment of that lovely city in Egypt with the nice library.<br />  But instead we get this dogs breakfast with some very good special effects. That basically said that he was Gay and incidentally kicked The Persian Empires butt. I have no problem with the established historical fact that he was either gay or bisexual or whatever. But there is a whole lot more to the story than just this.<br />  Like why did he do this all this fighting? (Avenge the Persian Invasion of Greece  a century before) Why did they drink like fish back then? (All soldiers drink to a greater or lessor degree)Why did Alexander kill his oldest ,best General and his family? (Because of raging insecurity after his pages tried to kill him) Why did the Army refuse to go into India? (It would of been nice to have one of the enlisted tell us why. Like "I wanna go home & I want to spend my loot!")<br />Hopefully some one some day will do this story justice but I guess its not today!<br />(Hint go see Michael Woods In the Footsteps of Al the Great)</p></body></html>

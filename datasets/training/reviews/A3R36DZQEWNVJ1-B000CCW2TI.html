<meta name="summary" content="Cillian Murphy's sinister performance takes flight"></head><body><p>Wes Craven's 2nd movie this year...the other one was the failed werewolf flop Cursed which came out in late February. Red Eye is much better then Cursed and is a Craven diversion from his usual gore scare fest. Rachel McAdams (Wedding Crashers, Mean Girls) plays Lisa who is taking the Red Eye back home because she just had her Grandma's funeral. She is going back to where she works which is a Hotel in Miami and also to her Father, played by the great Brian Cox (X2: X-Men United, Troy). In the airport she meets Jack Riptner, played with sinister ease by the awesome Cillian Murphy (Intermission, 28 Days Later). McAdams and Murphy hit it off sharing things with one another and having drinks. She then winds up ironically sitting right next to him on the plane. But it's not a coincedence because he is there for a purpose and that purpose is for McAdams to do somethings for him otherwise her Father dies. Murphy wants McAdams to have her Hotel switch rooms for a rich man and his family because he is going to be killed. So, McAdams tries everything to stall him and escape but he sees right threw her. Eventually, when the plane lands she escapes and he follows her to try to stop her. The two leads give good performances, especially Murphy who is playing yet another bad guy this summer alongside the hit Batman Begins where he played The Scarecrow. The end showdown scene in the house kinda felt a little bit Scream-ish. Also starring Colby Donaldson...and if you dont know who is he, he played one of the rich guy's secret service suits and he was also in the second season of Survivor...dont ask me how I know this...I just do.</p></body></html>

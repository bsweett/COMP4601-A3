<meta name="summary" content="Return to childhood"></head><body><p>It had been a while since I last spent one hour every week in front of the television watching episodes of a television series. In fact, I haven't done this since I was a child. I remember counting the minutes until the next show on "The fall guy", "CHiPs" or "Automan" began. After I grew up and time seemed scarse each year, I simply lost my interest for such series (although I rented the "Simpsons" seasons a while ago).<br /><br />And then, "Lost" came. As I was zapping through channels, AXN's short preview caught my attention. Being a fan of "Lord of flies", "And then there were none" and other such stories where a bunch of previously unacquainted people have to live together in a remote place, making life possible with what they have at hand, I decided that I would give this new series a try.<br /><br />From the first scenes of the plane crash, to the choice of the characters, the beautiful locations and the unusual things happening along the island (a polar bear in a tropical place!) I was hooked. I not only watched this first season in its entirety, but browsed through the net wanting to know more about everything related to the series.<br /><br />The writing is great, the episode structure is intelligent, mixing what is happening on the island (new discoveries, smoking monsters, antique planes crashed full of heroine, the "Others") to the tales of the lives of the characters previously to the plane crash. What were the reasons for each one of them to be in Sidney traveling to Los Angeles at that moment of their lives? How are they related to each other (because, in a way or another, they are)? The obvious attention production spends with every detail is also remarkable. Add to all that Evengeline Lilly and the show is almost perfect. Of course, there may be lots of inconsistencies, plot-holes and other absurdities in the series, but this time I'm not looking for them, I'm just watching each episode like I was a kid again, and having lots of fun.<br /><br />My only fear is a stalling in the development of the story. But in the first season it did not happen, as the variety of the characters and their relations proved to be a good source of plots to the series. Hope that the second season is as good as this first one. So, a solid five-star it is.</p></body></html>

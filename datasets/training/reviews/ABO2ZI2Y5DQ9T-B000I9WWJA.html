<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) Spike Lee's Highly Entertaining Heist Film (if You Can Ignore the Numerous Plot Holes)"></head><body><p>Spike Lee's `Inside Man' centers around a bank robbery in Manhattan, but if you are looking forward to seeing shoot-outs or explosions, you will be hugely disappointed. Lee's film is not about them; in spite of the hostage situation, it is more like a con-game done between three players - Denzel Washington's police detective, Clive Owen's bank robber, and Jodie Foster's mysterious female who represents the interest of one person.<br /><br />To reveal much about the story will only lessen the fun you will get while watching cleverly constructed `Inside Man.' I only say this; the film deals with a `perfect crime' scenario. At the beginning of the film, in some dark place like a prison cell, one Dalton Russell, Clive Owen's enigmatic mastermind, tells you about his idea about perfect crime. He knows how to do it, and he means it.<br /><br />The film gradually reveals the true meaning of his words, showing how the four robbers led by Dalton hit the bank and take hostage. Denzel Washington's detective Keith Fraizer hurries to the crime scene as hostage negotiator, but he is not the only one who is interested in the situation, as Mayor of NYC also arrives, and strongly suggests that an ace `fixer' Madeleine White (played by delightfully polite and ice-cold Jodie Foster) should remain there and give a `help' or two to solve some problems.<br /><br />[PLOT HOLES] I said the film is `clever,' but that doesn't mean the film's script by first-time writer Russell Gewirtz is free from plot holes. I said clever because it succeeds, almost if not perfectly, in covering up the numerous holes in the implausible plot with a taut storytelling of Lee, and the powerhouse acting from the three leads and the good supports such as Willem Dafoe, Christopher Plummer, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.<br /><br />You know, no `clever' robbers would take hostages; in `Inside Man,' however, there is a good reason for the robbers to take hostages, but the reason itself is, if you think about it rationally, highly unlikely. But the film's story remains still entertaining all the same, not by just following the story, but by showing the complexity of the characters. That's why `Inside Man' is most intriguing when it reflects the racial diversity of the city and the country, for example, in the scene where the police get panicky after seeing a man wearing a turban.<br /><br />But the main attraction of `Inside Man' is its skillful storytelling greatly helped by the top-notch cast. Not that the plot is totally unpredictable for some of you will be able to anticipate the twists in the plot. Moreover, we all know that Jodie's Foster's lawyer (or whatever she is) is only possible because of her good acting. We all know that no one is allowed to behave like her while a serious hostage situation is going on. But like any other good films about the perfect crimes, `Inside Man' requires suspension of disbelief, and much of it, and perhaps it is aware of its defect when it briefly refers to the films like `Serpico' and `Dog Day Afternoon' much more realistic version of police and heist in New York. Still `Inside Man is a very entertaining film as long as you can ignore certain elements in its very convoluted story.</p></body></html>

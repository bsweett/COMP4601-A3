The premise and the apparent message of ordinary people standing up to villains and crime and making a difference was very, very appealing.  But honestly, the only reason to watch KICK-ASS is the 3 fight scenes with the little girl. That's it. End of story. Of course, they are very violent and bloody, so if you can't imagine watching an 11-year-old girl stab, shoot, and slice the legs off of countless thug-types who deserve it, then there's no reason for you to watch KICK-ASS.<br /><br />But let's say you've been tricked into seeing KICK-ASS or someone has threatened to post unflattering photos of you and your hamster on Facebook if you don't watch the entire flick.  So you're sitting there in an empty theater and what do you see? Well, for the first 30 minutes, you DO NOT see any superhero stuff. No, you see pointless drivel about how hard it is to be a nerdy teenager. You get to see the main character's masturbatory fantasies (literally and graphically). And you wonder how this schmuck could afford a $99 wet suit. Finally, right around the 30 minute mark, he dons his wet suit, gets beaten to a bloody pulp, and sent to the hospital where everyone believes he's gay. So now, not only is he a nerdy teen, he's a faux gay nerdy teen.<br /><br />But I haven't mentioned the plot. Oh wait. For 33% of KICK-ASS, that IS the plot.  For the other 66%, it is a lot of gratuitous violence and gore.<br /><br />I was really disappointed in KICK-ASS.  It could have been a really good, positive movie.  But it degenerated into teen angst, gratuitous violence, and copious blood pretty quickly.  Yes, there are some funny moments, and yes, the ending is actually satisfying, but overall, KICK-ASS is just disturbing, and I won't recommend it to anyone.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A superb film that focuses on many subjects"></head><body><p>This drama, starring Clint Eastwood, and directed, produced, and partially written by him, is properly advertised as "the performance of a lifetime." It is undoubtedly one of the best films. The story is about an elderly man, an award winning veteran of the Korean War, an atheist, who has never been found contentment in life, whose wife just died, and who, knowing her husband's problems, asks a young parish priest to look after him. He lives in a neighborhood that has changed, surrounded by Orientals who he calls gooks, whom he doesn't understand and dislikes intensely. He is very possessive of what he has and wants to be left alone. He becomes involved with his neighbors when they are attacked by a gang. Everything about the film is great, the story, plot development, acting, pacing, suspense, scenery.<br /><br /> Viewers can be stimulated to ask lots of questions about the many issues raised in the film. These include: the problems of growing old, death of a spouse, illness among the aged, getting along with children, grandchildren, and neighbors, handling neighborhood gangs, prejudice, bad and belittling language, finding meaning in life, the existence of life after death, the impact of wars and killing, revenge, are clergy equipped to address problems they never faced. Most significantly is the issue of change: can an irascible discontented elderly man, who has no ability to interact with his own family, find meaning and love from strangers?</p></body></html>

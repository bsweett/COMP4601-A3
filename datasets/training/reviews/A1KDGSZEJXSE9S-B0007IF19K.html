<meta name="summary" content="Great movie"></head><body><p>I bought this movie a few weeks ago and finally got around<br /><br />to watching it... I thought it was one of the better movies<br /><br />I've seen this other with the exception of Million Dollar<br /><br />Baby.  The acting was top notch. It wasn't just Jamie Foxx<br /><br />either, as it was actually the entire cast.<br /><br />I thought Ray's mother was second to Jamie, and Kerry Wash-<br /><br />ington isn't far behind in 3rd place. I hope she makes it as<br /><br />a big star in the next few years.. Anyway, I thought the<br /><br />movie was well done. It didn't make it a complete feel good<br /><br />movie as there are times when you love Ray, and other times<br /><br />you want to hate him and lying cheating ways.<br /><br />It's amazing how Ray is so innocent at the start, but the<br /><br />fame and the attention obviousally became too much, and like<br /><br />lots of other singers he just got trapped in that type of<br /><br />life.<br /><br />I didn't like the fact that movie seem to go for a while and<br /><br />it seemed at the end it just kind of cut to the chase and<br /><br />act as if his career died after the 60's, which obviousally<br /><br />isn't true.... I guess I understand it alittle because the<br /><br />movie ran 2 1/2 hours as it is, but I'd like for it to have<br /><br />been finished to atleast the 90's or so.<br /><br />5 stars</p></body></html>

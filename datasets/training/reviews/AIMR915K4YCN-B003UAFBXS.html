<meta name="summary" content="Walker And All, He's Still The King!"></head><body><p>BUBBA HO-TEP is one of those quirky works of brilliance (like Spider Baby, Evil Dead 2, Donnie Darko, etc.) that make you scratch your head, while making you laugh and want to see it again. Bruce Campbell IS Elvis Aaron Presley! He's got the voice, the moves, and the attitude of the aging KING. Bored with his life as an aging rock icon, Elvis trades places (back in the 1970s) with one of his impersonators, Elvis tours as an imitation of himself, only to throw his hip out, sending him off the stage, into the crowd, into a coma; and eventually to the Shady Rest old age home in Mud Creek Texas. Now, instead of wowing audiences of screaming fans, Elvis finds himself bedridden and nearly fossilized. Then, a 3000 year old mummy shows up and starts thinning out the geriatric herd as it were. Joined by John Fitzgerald Kennedy (Ossie Davis), Elvis begins piecing together clues to unravel this Egyptian / Texan mystery. Can Elvis and JFK stop this shambling, musty horror in time? Can they keep it from sucking out the souls of everyone at the Shady Rest? Can they stay awake long enough to defeat this evil?? Watch and see! Highly recommended...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the best horro films ever...I great ghost story that will leave you on the edge of your seat"></head><body><p>The fog finally comes to dvd and it's loaded with lots of special features. I was surprised of the good extras this dvd had. The film is one of the best horror film's ever, I liked it better then Halloween. The story is simple ghost come back for bloody revenge on the 100 aniversary of the town Antonio Bay. The acting was great also Adrienne Barbeau dose a great job of Stevie Wayne, Jamelie Curtis in a small inosent role and screen legend Janet Lee. The film is a great ghost story and the score of the film is suspensfull and adds chills. The remake of the movie come out next month (october 2005) I seen some previewes and it dosent look as good as the original I hope they dont butcher it.</p></body></html>

The plot is believable and has a deeper layer than just a zombie style movie. After a military plane crashes into an isolated lake, a toxin developed by the government finds its way into the water system of a peaceful little town. Once the residents of Ogden Marsh start going 'crazy', it is difficult to know who is friend or foe. Sheriff Dutton (Timothy Olyphant of 'Deadwood'), must find a way out of the town with his pregnant wife before the government decides to clean up their problem the quickest way possible, through deadly force. A fast paced story with a lot of 'nail biting' moments.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Overwrought mystical fantasy"></head><body><p>Tim Burton's visually stunning but a bit too drawn out fable Big Fish was actually more deserving of 3 1/2 stars.<p>Pretty boy Billy Crudup playing Will Bloom, a young married reporter estranged from his father Ed Bloom is drawn to his dying dad's bedside to understand the essence of his life.  The aged Ed Bloom played marvelously by craggy, jowly, veteran actor Albert Finney was a Alabama based travelling salesman whose life story consisted of a Forrest Gumpian collection of hard to swallow tall tales.  Crudup and his wife played by French actress Marion Cotillard are treated to a plethora of these fables narrated by Finney.<p>The young Ed Bloom played by the versatile and likeable Ewan Mc Gregor marches through many improbable life experiences supported by nice performances by among others, Danny DeVito, Helena Bonham Carter, and the weirdo Steve Buscemi.  Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman give creditable performances as Ed Bloom's wife Sandra respectively older and younger.<p>The movie loses some of it's luster as it plods on about 1 or 2 stories too long.  The ending is somewhat predictable which left my with a slightly vapid, unsatisfying feeling.</p></body></html>

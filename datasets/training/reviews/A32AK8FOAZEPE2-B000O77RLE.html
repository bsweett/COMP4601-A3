<meta name="summary" content="this the-other-side-in-the-pacific-ocean movie actually sucks big time!"></head><body><p>and it bored me to death by watching it. and there were lot of movies about the second world war, but this movie unfortunately carried the most boring and dead-beat storyline. while 'flag of our fathers' was full of hollow parties and big words, 'letters from iwo jima' was even worse, not just boring, but subtly insert a message to let you see how cruel and abusive the japanese high ranking officers were to their subordinate soldiers. there almost nothing worth to be seen in this hollow and boring movie. i just have to say that both the 'flag' and the 'letters' sucked big time. they were two of the worst movies in my viewing experience, and they didn't even deserve my time to write reviews, because it's simply dumb after i've already wasted almost over 5 hours sitting through them.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Magic!"></head><body><p>When I lived in England in the late 70's a popular phrase for something that would work out just right was "Magic".<br />If you enjoy satire, and or British humor, and aren't offended by TERRIBLE language, then this is a fabulous send up of the "Action / Cop/ Buddy" genre of film.<br /><br />If you enjoyed what these blokes did to the "Zombie" genre in "Shaun of the Dead"  you should love this movie, which starts abit slower, but when it gets going... Magic!</p></body></html>

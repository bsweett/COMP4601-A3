<meta name="summary" content="Good non horror sequel"></head><body><p>Final Destination 2 proved something that most horror film sequels can't. If a scary movie sequel is full of laughs it can be fun. The film is full of good acting in particular A.J. Cook who carrys her first starring role very well. Tony Todd makes another chilling cameo and Ali Larter also does another good job. I hope this isn't the last Destination for the series. I give it *** stars based soley on the death sequences. The film is lot of fun and I can't wait to see Final Destination 4 in 3-D next year.</p></body></html>

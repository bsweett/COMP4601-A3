<meta name="summary" content="Dreadlock holiday."></head><body><p>A satellite identifies an unexpected heat source in Antarctica, leading corporate bigwig Weyland (Lance Henrikson) to hastily form a search expedition.  Foremost among the team is Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan), a guide with experience traversing frozen terrain; Lathan's quite likeable in this movie, although she's certainly not on par with Ripley as a protagonist.  The team is told that their search will be risky, but the payoff seems worthwhile -- a giant pyramid buried under 2000 feet of ice.  When the crew arrives in Antarctica, they are stunned to find that a giant tunnel has been dug to the pyramid.  Before they know it, they're being attacked by two different species -- however, are they the prey or just unfortunate observers?<br /><br />AVP is a decent sci-fi thriller with fairly good effects.  Unfortunately, we never get to know the expedition team well enough to muster any sympathy when they find themselves being attacked.  In addition, most of the scenes are staged in near-dark -- the film ends up looking dingy and the action is sometimes hard to follow visually.  Finally, the plot doesn't really kick into gear until about an hour into the movie, when the crew puts together the pieces.<br /><br />AVP pulls from the mythology of both movie series.  As such, it's likely to please some fans of the Alien and Predator flicks.  I really enjoyed the Alien movies; however, I found myself fairly disappointed by AVP as it could have been so much better.  AVP is a decent b-movie, but not worthy of the Alien series.</p></body></html>

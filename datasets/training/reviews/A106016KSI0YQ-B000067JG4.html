<meta name="summary" content="Julie spinning on a mountaintop: it doesn't get any better"></head><body><p>It's been fashionable to make fun of THE SOUND OF MUSIC even before it came out, when, during its filming, Christopher Plummer reportedly referred to it sneeringly as &quot;The Sound of Mucas.&quot; Pauline Kael's infamous vitriolic (and very funny) review of it sealed her reputation as one of America's grand culture mavens--and set the tone for the film's later criticisms by characterizing it as soulless and manipulative.<p>But this reputation is largely unearned. Certainly the children are at times hard to take (especially Charmian Carr, who seems simultaneously vixenish--&quot;tooooooo wriiiiiiiite onnnnnnn&quot;--and wholesome, as if she were a mutant hybrid of Ann-Margret and Doris Day). But the film is extremely visually inventive, especially in its contrasts of the cramped spaces of the Captain's villa and the beautiful open exteriors of Salzburg and the surrounding Alps. And most critics have overlooked that the film's scenarists have worked in an audience surrogate to sneer at Maria's goody-goodyness in the person of the Countess. Memorably played by Eleanor Parker, the Countess is given to all kinds of snide comments when things get too sugary (&quot;My dear, is there anything you *don't* do?&quot;).<p>Best of all, the film has at its center the amazing Julie Andrews, who makes the best Maria imaginable. She really does make you believe in Maria's kindness and simplicity, and her love of the outdoors. In her two most iconic moments--spinning on the moutaintop during the title number, and leading the children at top speed through a footbridge during &quot;Do Re Mi&quot;-- her arms are characteristically spread wide, accepting the entirety of the beautiful world around her. And has anybody who has seen her ever forgotten how she closes &quot;Do Re Mi,&quot; hitting that perfect &quot;fa&quot; as she leaps up the steps? This performance alone forever cements Andrews's status as an icon in world cinema.</p></body></html>

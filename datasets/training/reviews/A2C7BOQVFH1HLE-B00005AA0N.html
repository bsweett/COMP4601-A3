<meta name="summary" content="Great War Movie! Great Biopic! Great DVD!  Even Better Blu-Ray!"></head><body><p>This is one of the very, very few great Hollywood movies about historical events and personalities in which hardly any liberties or revisionist history attempts have been made and yet the unadulterated "true" story is still so dramatic and exciting.  This movie is fully deserving of all 8 of the Oscars that it won and is not only among the top 5 war movies that I've ever seen but is also among the top 5 biopics that I've ever seen.<br /><br />Patton is shown, warts and all, with little attempt made at trying to sugar coat his colourful personality although this movie gives us a chance to see the other side of the story that we get of the man from the sensationalist press of the time.  Having served in the military myself, I actually fully appreciated what he did to the cowardly soldier and I know I wouldn't have apologised if it was me but Patton saw the bigger picture and knew that he was needed to continue achieving greater things and so did what he had to which really impressed me.  Although the film is almost 3 hours in length, I didn't feel it as that movie is just that good.<br /><br />As for the DVD, the picture and sound quality is just excellent.  The THX Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround option makes the sound quality very good and I couldn't easily find any imperfections with the picture quality making me thoroughly satisfied with this dvd version.  Although there are no special features worth mentioning, the picture and sound quality more than make up for this.  I can only imagine how much better the Blu-ray version of this film will be given that it is already so good on this standard version.  I also appreciated the Anamorphic widescreen effect which ensured that only about a fifth of my widescreen was blacked out unlike the pure letterbox format which means I'd have to squint as only half my screen is utilised.  I understand that different people have different opinions about the various formats but for me anamorphic works well enough.<br /><br />This is a great movie and the dvd is equally as good; great film, great picture and sound quality albeit no special features save an audio essay on Patton's life still make this a great value purchase.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Updated 6 June 2011:<br /><br />As Amazon will not let me review this separately, I'll have to append this here:  the blu-ray version of this great film is certainly worth the double-dip.  As good as the picture quality was on the dvd I reviewed above, 1080p actually improves upon it on this version.  The sound quality in DTS HD 5.1 surround is excellent too and is also an improvement over the dvd.  The special features aren't much to shout about and is not an improvement over that of the dvd but the combined improvement of both the picture and sound qualities makes this a worthy upgrade.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

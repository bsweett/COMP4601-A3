It works because it aspires to pump your blood, and does. At ninety minutes, you can do dinner-and-a-movie and conceivably get home before dawn.<br /><br />The plot is thankfully spare. Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy), an operative for a terrorist group, forces plucky hotel manager Lisa (Rachael McAdams) to help assasinate the podium-pounding chief of Homeland Security. How? By putting a hitman outside her father's house, Rippner offers Lisa a choice: Call her hotel from a red eye flight to change the chief's room assignment; or hold a funeral for her dad.<br /><br />Carl Ellworth's script milks what it can out of the first suspense - Lisa making the call - and then erects a chase when the plane lands to save the chief and Lisa's father( the estimable Brian Cox, who probably spent a whole day on the set, and invaribly will be the guy all the other actors were honored to meet in the DVD commentary). The script is clever and concise - it cares not for the motives of the terrorist group, nor does it dawdle on Lisa's personal life. If you want to read into Rippner's casual misogyny, and Lisa's eventual response, go ahead. "Red Eye" tacks a footnote onto the gender debate but doesn't berate the point.<br /><br />Instead, it enjoys the lead performances. Murphy is fine as one of those bemused, malevolent types who talk in complete sentences but would really like to crush skulls. He becomes one of those limping caricatures of evil in the final act, his state perfectly underlined by a single line from Lisa.<br /><br />McAdams does a lot of face acting - she produces some serious waterworks - and generally represents the cute, casual everywoman. Pretty. Fashionable. Loyal. Sweet. Courteous. Good with a weapon.<br /><br />Combine this with her role in "Wedding Crashers" and she's the big winner in an average summer movie season, casting a surprising shadow on her "Mean Girls" co-star Lindsay Lohan, who generally become a walking tabloid since that film. There is precedent for this: Justine Bateman was the young star of "Satisfaction" way back when. But it's Julia Roberts rescuing a rotten Dave Matthews Band CD in 2005.</p></body></html>

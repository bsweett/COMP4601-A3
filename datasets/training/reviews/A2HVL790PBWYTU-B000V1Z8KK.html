These boys killed my dog.""></head><body><p>After long years in the back burner, author Stephen Hunter's laconic, sharpshooting hero, Bob Lee Swagger, comes to the big screen, finally, in SHOOTER. Based on Hunter's 1993 techno-thriller of a book POINT OF IMPACT, this film, however, makes Swagger over from a middle-aged Vietnam vet to a much younger Marine Corps Gunny Sergeant plying his sniping trade in these more contemporary times.<br /><br />PLOT SPOILERS begin and never really end:<br /><br />The picture opens with Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) and best friend/spotter Donnie out on a military op in Ethiopia. As usual with things of this sort, the operation becomes another instance of a mission gone horribly wrong as Swagger and Donnie end up being abandoned by their home base and Donnie mortally buys a bunch of bullets. Cut to three years later, where a disillusioned and now ponytailed Swagger has retired from the Marines and has become a recluse living in the Wyoming wilds. His preferred company is a dog talented enough to fetch him a cold one from the fridge.<br /><br />But the government comes a'callin' in the form of the very self-assured Colonel Johnson (Danny Glover), who tells Swagger that because of certain governmental leaks, the President's safety is now compromised. Johnson wants Swagger to scope out the President's upcoming multi-city tour and come up with the most likely scenario for an assassination. Swagger is initially disinclined, but the colonel knows the right buttons to push and plays on Bob Lee's patriotism until Swagger caves in. To cut to the chase here, Swagger does come up with an assassination scenario and - BAM! - is promptly shot and framed for the fatal shooting of the archbishop, who had stood next to the president. The rest of the film has to do with Swagger as he channels his inner Rambo to administer to his own wounds and then gets his trigger-happy vengeance on.<br /><br />TRAINING DAY director Antoined Fuqua delivers a polished and sometimes exciting action movie here. There are several thrilling sequences where you just can't help but root for Swagger as he shows up like an avenging angel and kicks copious villainous booty. The wild shootout in the backwoods of Virginia and the showdown in the snow are two very gripping sequences. And, yes, Swagger does remind me quite a bit of Jason Bourne, another anti-hero from literature. Not that that's a bad thing.<br /><br />Here's the not so positive stuff: SHOOTER does suffer from a decided lack of originality. We've seen this premise before with its weary plot elements, about a man who is framed and, now, it's become him against the world (again, you don't have to go any further than the BOURNE films). *Sigh* even after all these years, Hitchcock still does it best. This time, the "twist" is that the man implicated is a long range marksman (but who can wreak close range havok if need be, with or without weapons). There's some stuff about the nuances of sniping, of how the Corealis effect and the wind and calculating distance and such actually do play a crucial part. I do find the opening bits between Swagger and his spotter buddy quite involving as that sequence somewhat breaks down what goes on between a sniper and his spotter during a mission. But, overall, when it comes to the lowdown on sniperology, the movie SNIPER does it better.<br /><br />What sucks is that we have to wade thru another muddied conspiracy, this time centering on oil pipelines and the massacre of an African village, the intricacies of which I couldn't have cared less. The villains are boring. We have a smug, seemingly untouchable lead villain ("I win, you lose!"), an over-the-top psycho underling (Elias Koteas), and a (gasp!) crooked senator (Ned Beatty). And, of course, a mob of second-hand minions who are no match for Swagger's solo but righteous act and are mowed down with ridiculous ease. Kate Mara (ZOOM, WE ARE MARSHALL) is here because you have to have a hot chick even if she's playing the second fiddle, eye-candy role of the not-so-grieving widow. Kate is very beautiful and she tries, but her scenes with Wahlberg, the scenes that should count the most, are lukewarm. It doesn't help that nothing happens between them, on-screen anyway. There's one moment when I thought things would develop to the next level, but, then, phfft...nothing. I don't know how long Swagger was recovering in Sarah's home but she went from uncertainty to acceptance to staunchily aiding and abetting the dude in a seemingly inordinate amount of time. Ah, platonic love...<br /><br />The good news is that Michael Pena (CRASH) is very good as Nick Memphis, the young but lowly FBI agent who comes to suspect that not all is as it seems. In his further investigations, Memphis proves to be dogged and perceptive, to the point where he becomes noticed by the wrong people in the department. Believing that he's going to be fired because of a prior slip up (as shown in the film), he persists anyway. The good news for him is that this persistence also gets him noticed by Swagger, who eventually comes to see him as an ally. As Memphis, Pena is funny and frustrated, fearful and savvy, suspicious and smart. Not too surprisingly, his character is imbued with more personality than Swagger, who, at times, seems to be nothing more than a killing machine.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg as Bob Lee Swagger does his best, and it's sure good enough. He doesn't get any showy emoting moments here, other than maybe during his ministrations to his wounds, wherein the viewer fully empathizes with the agony and desperation undergone by the character. But, let's face it, Bob Lee Swagger is supposed to be low key and taciturn, a simple man who's crafty in certain ways. But, irregardless, Wahlberg is convincing in the part, or as convincing as you're gonna get, given the outrageous storyline. When called for in his scenes, Marky Mark shows off a certain no-nonsense intensity and ruthlessness that befit the character. I like it, what he does in this role.<br /><br />One can't help but wonder how Tommy Lee Jones would've fared as Bob Lee Swagger. Tommy Lee Jones was originally slated to play Bob Lee Swagger, and, to be honest, as much as I like Mark Wahlberg, Jones would've been ideal. For those who haven't read the books, Swagger is actually written as a southern hick. Wahlberg sidesteps that issue (or, at least, I didn't notice a southern accent), but Tommy Lee Jones, who not only is closer in age to the book version of Swagger but, with his country drawl and sensibilities, would've definitely played up the hillbilly aspect. And, not to put down Wahlberg's acting chops - which is improving all the time - but Jones is the better actor of the two. Oh, well...As a substitute, Wahlberg is a very do-able choice.<br /><br />Three stars for this one, a film that has its moments but becomes ultimately bogged down in its own hackneyed trappings. If you liked this film but haven't yet read the book it was based on, then definitely check out the novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553563513">Point of Impact</a> (which is better than the movie) and its two sequels <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/044022313X">Black Light</a> (1996) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0440226457">Time to Hunt</a> (1998). You just might go ballistic *sorry*.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This is pretty lousy"></head><body><p>Other reviewers have already covered all the bases, but I feel I have to say something about this cinematic prostate exam. Avoid. This film massacres the book. It leaves out important characters and events, and completely changes the story(the ending). Even if you've never read the book and don't know what you're missing, avoid anyway! Hannibal Lecter is NOT scary outside his cell. It's a huge mistake to show the things he does. By not showing you and simply telling you-like they did in Silence Of The Lambs-your mind can fill in the gaps with the most horrible and terrifying things imaginable. That worked! Showing him does not! And what's with Julianne Moore? Why does Hollywood think that using a different actor for a role played by a previous actor/actress isn't going to affect anything? Jodie Foster was half of the friggin' movie! I'm sorry, but when they switch actors it is just not the same, especially such a memorable role in a classic film. Why not just replace Egon with Adam Sandler for Ghostbusters 3? So, if you know what's good for ya, run screaming. It's not scary or suspenseful. My mother's tupperware party had more thrills.</p></body></html>

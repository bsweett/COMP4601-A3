Helming the remake of the Rat Pack classic, "Ocean's Eleven", Soderbergh shows that he not only has what it takes to deliver tight dramatic pieces, but also has the directorial capability to deliver a drama that is much more light hearted yet still compelling, and providing audiences an entertaining film and remake that can stand up to the original classic without any problem.<br /><br />"Ocean's Eleven" follows a recently paroled thief, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) as he attempts to put his life back together by trying to get his ex-wife, Tess (Julia Roberts) back from Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) who just happens to own the Bellagio Casino in Las Vegas.  To accomplish this, Danny has devised a plan to steal 150 million dollars from the Bellagio during a pay-per-view boxing match.  In order for this mission to be a success, Danny must enlist the aid of friends and fellow cons or all is lost.<br /><br />"Ocean's Eleven" achieved several feats that are very difficult to accomplish in one film; the ensemble cast, remaking a classic and possibly surpassing the original, and presenting fresh ideas.  Most films can only hope to achieve one of these points, if any.  The ensemble cast for "Ocean's Eleven" is basically a who's-who of Hollywood A-list talent, from George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Bernie Mac; to legends, such as Carl Reiner and Elliot Gould.<br /><br />Anytime a director or studio hopes to remake a classic film that is loved by many people, especially Sinatra fans, you're just asking for trouble.  First, you're expecting the fans to forgive changes that you make to the storyline, second you have to compete with an already successful movie in it's own right, so to even be remembered a remake needs to be better than the original which is not easy to do.  What makes remaking a film even more difficult, is that in this day and age it is increasingly difficult to present new and fresh ideas to the big screen, and when you're core story is based on a film from 1960, this task is even more difficult.<br /><br />Thankfully "Ocean's Eleven" manages to please on all levels, giving audiences an entertaining caper film, that gathers the best of Hollywood and presents a new take on a classic film.<br /><br />"Ocean's Eleven" is rated PG-13 for language.</p></body></html>

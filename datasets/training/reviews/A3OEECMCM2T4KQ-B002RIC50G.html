<meta name="summary" content="A great surprise...Hannibal has Risen"></head><body><p>It is a rare event indeed when a film adaptation surpasses the novel in just about all aspects.<br /><br />Although Thomas Harris penned the screenplay, when the last credits began to roll, my thought was that the book was merely an incidental, written with the ultimate goal in mind to put the story on the screen. This is a very well produced film, well paced with spectacular detail, and an outstanding performance by unknown, Gaspard Ulliel, capturing that sophisticated, pure evil which we have come to expect from the good doctor: a truly mesmerising performance as the character grows to understand his true nature.<br /><br />To be fair, the book was a sad disappointment, (see my review) making Hannibal into a card- board -cut- out- run-of-the-mill serial killer. It took a lot for me to spend the money to see the film, expecting the adaptation to fall short of the novel, thus when considering the blandness of the text, one would assume the film to be a disaster, not so in the least.<br /><br />Gong Li as Lady Murasaki Shikibu is not only stunning but her gentle expressions reveal a sensitive soul and one that truly cared for Hannibal, staging a cover-up for his first murder. Interestingly, it is here we discover Hannibal's prime motivation to kill: terribly rude people, and that poor French butcher, (a Nazi collaborator) after being extremely rude to Lady Shikibu, copped it from Hannibal in a cruel, slow and creative fashion. This was an extremely tense scene in the film, where we first witness Hannibal's creative and great love for the kill.<br /><br />In the film and the novel, including a mention in the last novel, `Hannibal', the reason the good doctor developed his tendency towards the eating of human flesh, still doesn't wash with me. The character is too complex, too intelligent, too self aware to suddenly carve out the delectable cheeks of his second victim and have a one-man barbecue. Harris should have researched a little harder and find what turns highly intelligent people into meat eaters of the human variety.<br /><br />Although the professional critics panned this film, compared with the novel, Hannibal Rising is a good story and a good and fitting contribution to Hannibal and Silence of the Lambs films... a wonderful surprise...a solid four star rating.</p></body></html>

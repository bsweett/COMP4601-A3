That is a totally inadequate way to judge it, however.  Well, now, after numerous viewings, I have to admit that if Goodfellas is a 10, Casino is a 9.  The plot is suberb and De Niro and Pesci are as perfect in this film as in any other.  Interestingly, the hatred one feels for Sharon Stone's character may be the best proof of the diamond (intentional plot reference there) performance she puts forth.  Unbelievable.  The cast is superb and this is one of Martin Scorsese's finest productions.  I was incredibly impressed and remain that way today.</p></body></html>

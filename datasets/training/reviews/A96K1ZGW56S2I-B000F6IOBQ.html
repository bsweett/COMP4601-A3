The movie fills in part of the story so those unfamiliar with the first film won't be left behind.  As much as UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION is a sequel, it's also a story of origins.  In this movie, the audience is told where the first vampires and lycans came from. Apparently, there was one immortal who had two sons.  One son became the father of the vampires (Markus) and the other the father of the lycans.  However, the lycan (William) was unstable and his father and brother were forced to hunt the creature down, capture it, and kill those who had turned. Thus the long war between the vampires and the lycans began almost from the beginning.<br /><br />With this lesson of origins told, the movie races back to the present day where we find Michael and Selene on the run.  Markus is awakened from his sleep and doesn't like what Selene has done. He's been planning all along that once he was awaken that he would find his brother and forge a new vampire/lycan alliance.<br /><br />UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION is a decent sequel. There is an unnecessary sex scene and most of the fighting is on a one-on-one basis instead of army versus army. Nevertheless, the film is pretty much action packed from the beginning and except for the moments to fill in some "history" the movie doesn't slow down. I'm not sure if the studio is planning on making UNDERWORLD into a trilogy. If so, since the 2nd part of a trilogy usually deals with origins, UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION is a worthy sophomoric episode.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A fantastic adaptation of a captivating book"></head><body><p>This is a fantastic adaptation of Stieg Larsson's novel. The casting is perfect, the acting is superb, and although several elements of the book were altered for the film, it really stays true to the heart of the story. None of the disturbing and violent aspects of the book were toned down for the movie, which surprised and pleased me. The only mild complaint I have is that because so much material from the book obviously needed to be cut for the 2.5 hour film, many of the characters barely get any screen time. For example, I think Erika only appears briefly in two scenes, and her relationship with Mikael isn't even acknowledged in the film, which is a huge disappointment. Also, many members of the Vanger family, including Martin and Isabella, only appear very briefly in the film. While I understand the need for it to be that way in order to keep the movie at an average length, it does detract from the whole mystery of the Vanger family and doesn't give the audience much of an opportunity to analyze the suspects in detail. Overall, though, I really enjoyed this movie very much and look forward to watching the other two installments in the trilogy.</p></body></html>

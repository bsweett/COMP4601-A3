<meta name="summary" content="Part Of A Series, But Unique"></head><body><p>This is a lot lighter hearted than the previous movies of the Star Trek series.  It continues the story started in "The Wrath Of Khan", but it is a unique movie.  Both this and the previous one were directed by Leonard Nimoy, but there is nothing in common between the two pictures aside from the director and the cast.<br /><br />A lot has been made of the "Save The Whales" theme of this picture.  It also, though, shows why Trekkies love Star Trek.  True, we enjoy the imagination of science fiction, but the best part is the characters and their interaction.  Can anything match Russian Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Uhara (Nichelle Nichols) on the streets of San Francisco asking where the nuclear weapons were?  Or Scotty (James Doohan) making a deal with a businessman for some plexiglass?  Or Spock (Nimoy) asking if it was time for another colorful metaphor?<br /><br />This movie does have the worst language of any of the Star Trek movies, but in context it is easy to laugh at even if you disapprove.  I would highly recommend this movie.</p></body></html>

Well, saying that Forbidden Planet was based on The Tempest is like saying Silver Streak was based on Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes.  It would be better to say Forbidden Planet was inspired by The Tempest.<br /><br />Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) headed a doomed scientific party twenty years prior to the planet Altair-4.  A rescue party has been sent to find their fate.  It is headed by the dashing Captain Adams (Leslie Nielsen - yes at one time Leslie was dashing.)  Morbius warns off Adams but Adams is determined to find out the fate of the expedition.<br /><br />Morbius tells him that all died from a strange monster, all except he and his wife.  Oh and his beautiful daughter, Altaira (Anne Francis).  The entire crew falls for Altaira including the Captain.  Little by little the secrets of the planet, its extinct race, the Krells, and the monster are revealed.  We also have the first famous robot, Robbie, the Robot.<br /><br />Pidgeon is most famous for his series of films with Greer Garson, including the Oscar winner Mrs. Miniver.  But when she retired, so did his career (and that was a shame as he is a great actor).  This was a chance for him to headline a film.  He created a niche for himself that would give him quality films until he retired.  By the way he reunited with Anne Francis, sort of, in Funny Girl.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was up and comers.  Most found their success in television.  Anne Francis became Honey West.  Leslie Nielsen is most associated with Police Squad.  Jack Kelly was one of the Mavericks.  Richard Anderson was the boss of The Six Million Dollar Man and Bionic Woman.  Earl Holliman was boss to Police Woman.  James Drury was The Virginian.  So as you can see, there are a lot of familiar faces here.<br /><br />The production quality is a bit cheesy but this was really the first true outer space film and you have to forgive this.  The sets are great but they look like sets.  By today's standards, the visual effect are bland but you have to take it for the time that this was made.  The effects were state of the are for the 50's and extremely clean.  They blend very well with the scene, they do not look at all fake.<br /><br />As stated before, this is inspired by The Tempest.  The Tempest is on of my favorite Shakespeare plays but it is seldom staged and it has only been filmed for television.  It would increase your enjoyment of the film to see The Tempest.<br /><br />DVD EXTRAS: None</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Grainy Video, Good Audio"></head><body><p>I'm not going to review the movie; just the Blu-Ray disc, which is what everyone who's interested in purchasing this movie on Blu-Ray wants to read.<br /><br />I purchased the 2010 Blu-Ray version of this film.  I can't believe that they can't make a good Blu-Ray disc from a 2005 movie.  There is a lot of grain.  A lot of detail, yes, but a lot of grain.  It is probably better than the DVD.  Just beware.  For a newer movie, I expected exceptional video.  It is not.<br /><br />The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is good (all 5 channels plus sub-woofer).</p></body></html>

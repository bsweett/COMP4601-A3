However, changing public tastes resulted in a majestic glossy-looking effort that, despite its technical innovations, failed to become the blockbuster the studio had hoped for. The story, slightly changed from its Grimm?s fairytale origins, charts the birth of Princess Aurora (vocal by Mary Costa). The young Princess is cursed by the evil Maleficent, a horned sorceress visually realized by animator, Mark Davis, that has to rank among the all time great Disney villainesses. Before her sixteenth birthday, Aurora will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. But three good fairies believe otherwise. They usher off the baby Aurora into the woods and raise her as their own.  But Aurora meets up with her future in a big way when she comes across the brooding Prince Philip (vocal by Bill Shirley). He instantly succumbs to her charms, not realizing that she is the princess he is supposed to marry. But when Maleficent discovers their romance, she is determined to see that tomorrow never comes for the couple. The magnificently staged final show down between Prince Philip and Maleficent is chillingly good entertainment on every level and the story is as fresh and appealing to seniors as it is for the young at heart.<br />"Sleeping Beauty" was shot in Technirama - a Cinemascope-style 2:35:1 aspect ratio that, in the past, has suffered on 1:33:1 television displays in a cropped off pan and scan image. On disc one of this two disc set we get both the Technirama transfer and a full frame copy ? to satisfy those who have yet to realize that full frame means fifty percent of the image is missing from their television screens. The review herein will concentrate on the widescreen version of the film which, in a word, is beautiful! Colors are rich, vibrant, bold and have been carefully rebalanced to provide a very smooth and crisp looking transfer. Black and contrast levels are fully realized.<br />A few problems - minor digital noise and a halo effect during portions of the forest sequence that flashes so quickly you almost have to stop and think, "Did I just see that?" The audio, remixed to 5.1 but strident, strangely lacking in bass - I say, strangely because "Sleeping Beauty" was recorded in stereo that, while, of course, should sound dated by today's standards, usually has a strong sonic bass characteristic that is curiously absent here.<br />Extras too are something of a disappointment. We get the "Once Upon A Dream" featurette - billed as a ?new? documentary on the making of the film. Created for the previously issued laserdisc and VHS copies this featurette is too short - not covering the scope of production. Next, there's the Peter Tchaikovsky Story - a badly acted and largely fictional account of the man who was inspired to write, among other things, the "Sleeping Beauty" ballet. The transfer here is terribly faded, suffers from chips and scratches and digital noise, edge enhancement and shimmering fine details. We also get the "Grand Canyon" featurette that accompanied "Sleeping Beauty" on its original theatrical engagement, but again, as with the Tchaikovsky Story, all the same criteria apply and - this time - the Technirama image HAS NOT BEEN ENHANCED FOR 16:9 TELEVISION DISPLAYS!!!<br />There's a really, REALLY awful music video, some benign child's play and a few short featurettes that, among other topics, explain how the film was shot, the techniques used in the animation and the restoration process employed for this new DVD.<br />Over all, I could have done without these studio junkets, especially since none of them were even moderately cleaned up for inclusion into this special edition. Still, for its stunning art of animation and a near pristine anamorphic transfer of the film - once upon a dream no more!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Inside Man DVD Review"></head><body><p>Inside Man is not your average bank robbery action film. It's a thought provoking thriller that will have you guessing until the last scene. Denzel Washington stars in the film as a detective thrust into the middle of a huge bank robbery. Dozens of people-including women and children are being held hostage by seemingly ruthless bank robbers. After talking with the bank robber in charge, Denzel's character feels that there is more to this robbery than appears. Something just doesn't ring right with the robber's demands. Jodie Foster has a small role in the film as a broker who works closely with the bank. Clive Owen stars as the mastermind of the complex robbery.<br /><br />Inside Man was directed by critically acclaimed director Spike Lee. The DVD includes bonus features which include deleted scenes, a documentary about the working history of Spike Lee and Denzel Washington, feature commentary and the making of Inside Man.<br /><br />My husband really enjoyed this film but I personally felt let down. There is so much action around the climax of the film and as the film comes down there is no big bang or big action scene it kind of came in like a lion and ended like a lamb.</p></body></html>

I mean my wife and I we're shocked when the credits rolled and saw that the lead voice of Hiccup was played by Jay, um, uh, Barawho and not Slater. Anyway....<br /><br />How to Train Your Dragon is a great family movie and it came recommended to me by several friends that don't even have kids. Now, I've seen some animated features (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I654UI">The Incredibles</a>) that could potentially make my all time list of favorite movies, but I'd have to think hard about any animated movie that would make it into my top 20 of all time. And of my top 20 favorite movies half would likely only get 4 versus 5 stars. Dragon would land on a separate list somewhere only in about the middle of the pack of just my favorite "animated" movies. It's a good movie...but classic? Nah.<br /><br />Against his father's will, the timid Hiccup sneaks out with a new weapon he designed. Turns out the weapon works pretty well and he brings down the most feared dragon in the land with it. The weapon doesn't kill the beast, and as the title of the movie might suggest, Hiccup instead forms a friendship with the monster that could change human/dragon relations forever.<br /><br />I was thoroughly entertained. My wife thought it was okay. My kids...they liked it. No one was wowed. Perhaps I've spoiled my family with my liberal stance of letting them watch pretty much anything they want (within reason). Or maybe we've all just overdosed on reruns of the early <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DYJTVW">SpongeBob Episodes</a> on DVD. Cuz, I'll tell ya what, if you said to me that Nick is running a marathon of the first 50 SpongeBob episodes or Cartoon Network is premiering How to Train Your Dragon, I'd been tuning into Nick.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030IIZ4M">Toy Story</a> is a 5 star animated movie. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXXJ">Shrek</a> is a 5 star animated movie. Even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007LVCM">A Bug's Life</a> is a 5 star animated movie. How to Train Your Dragon is a really good animated feature that will soon be forgotten by all who watched on my TV set. Don't get me wrong...Dragon is definitely a worthy rental at minimum. It's just not a classic. But as of this writing about 90% of the other reviewers here might disagree with me, so please take my review for what it's worth: an opinion.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Danny Trejo is a great presence...but the film is unsatisfying"></head><body><p>There's no question that Robert Rodriguez's MACHETE is a lot of "guilty pleasure" fun.  There's a visceral pleasure to be had from a guy as outstandingly scary looking as Danny Trejo wielding a machete and severing heads and limbs, disemboweling bad guys and general leaving a trail of carnage in his wake.<br /><br />All of these things were promised in the fake trailer for MACHETE which was presented prior to the start of GRINDHOUSE, the wonderfully crazy experience crafted by Rodriguez and his buddy, Quentin Tarantino.  Both men are drawn to the cheap thrill, to the idea of going just a little too far and over-the-top.  But Tarantino (PULP FICTION, KILL BILL, etc.) is extremely talented, a full tool box of skills at his disposal.  Rodriguez, on the other hand, mostly wields a hammer.  It's a stylish hammer, to be sure (see DESPERADO)...but his films don't feel like cheap and tawdry thrills delivered by a mad genius...they feel like exploitation flicks.  Often very fun...but also empty.<br /><br />Trejo plays the titular Machete (a Mexican federale in hiding in the US after his family is slaughtered by a horrible drug kingpin, played by Steven Seagal) with about two expressions.  He's a wonder to look at and has a crazy charisma.  He's not much of an actor, but he's riveting nonetheless.  His scarred and pock-marked face is real, and he carries himself like a guy who earned those scars.  Thank goodness he IS so much fun to watch, because if his role were a failure, there would be little else to enjoy.  Machete is drawn back into the spotlight when he's framed by Jeff Fahey in an assassination attempt upon Robert DeNiro, who plays a Texas state senator who campaigns purely on the idea of driving out illegal immigrants and then putting up an electrified fence.  You will not be surprised to know that Fahey, DeNiro and Don Johnson as a border vigilante, are all actually teaming up with Seagal to control the flow of illegals, and to profit from their misery.<br /><br />Machete is joined in his quest for vengeance by an immigration officer (Jessica Alba, once again proving unable to create a remotely believable portrayal of a human being), his brother who is also a priest (Cheech Marin, earning solid but obvious laughs) and a tough underground immigration supporter (Michele Rodriguez...looking mightily convincing wielding weapons).  Mayhem ensues, all of it bloody and noisy.  The film is gleefully violent, and usually only takes a break from the violence for some gratuitous nudity.  Lindsey Lohan shows up as Fahey's drugged-out daughter, and we get some body double nudity from her, in case you're interested.<br /><br />The movie is pretty much what you'd expect.  The audience of mostly younger men and their seemingly reluctant dates (those who had dates) whooped and hollered and had a great time.  For myself, I kept wishing for wit that was a bit funnier, for visual flair that was more dazzling.  Rodriguez stages plenty of violence, but much of it is surprisingly clumsy and unclever.  In one scene, he takes a long close-up of a corkscrew.  Why?  So that you remember it when two scenes later, it is plunging into the eye socket of a bad guy.  The foreshadowing of weapons of destruction is this obvious throughout.  And the best action sequences occur in the prologue and in a relatively early scene in a hospital, where Machete uses a truly unusual method of escape.  As the film wears on, the scenes get bigger but they become less satisfying.<br /><br />And imagine, if you will, 66 year old Trejo taking on a bloated and barely ambulatory Seagal in a climactic scene.  Yep, it was about as climactic as packing a lunch in the morning.  Tarantino is a master of finding great old stars and reinvigorating them in his masterpieces of mayhem (David Carradine in KILL BILL, Robert Forster in JACKIE BROWN).  Rodriguez seemingly wants to do the same with Seagal, but Steven Seagal was never a good actor even in his heyday.  DeNiro has minor amounts of fun in his role...but even the thrill of seeing him in such junk wears thin.  Fahey is generic.  Don Johnson has a bit of fun for awhile...but as with DeNiro, the fun wears off.  Only Michelle Rodriguez makes a real impression...she looks like a girl who would take no nonsense from anyone, and would handle herself well in a gunfight.  She is suitable support for the formidable Trejo.<br /><br />I enjoyed myself for most of the film, but by the end, I had stopped laughing and smiling.  In many ways, that fake trailer from GRINDHOUSE packed all the entertainment of MACHETE into a 3 minute package.  I remembered it so fondly, and that helped me enjoy this film...but in the end, MACHETE just couldn't cut it for a feature lengthy film.</p></body></html>

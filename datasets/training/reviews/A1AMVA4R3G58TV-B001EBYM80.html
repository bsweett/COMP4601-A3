<meta name="summary" content="A Mystical Story of Death Row"></head><body><p>Michael Clark Duncan plays a man on death-row for killing two young girls. Did he or did he not commit the crime ? His character also has the mystical power to heal people. He heals Tom Hank's character of a bladder infection. This leads Hank's character to believe there is more to this giant man than just a convicted murderer.<p>Not only are there outstanding performances by Tom Hanks and Michael Clark Duncan - but the supporting actors are outstanding in their own right. All around, every performance is flawless.<p>On the surface this is a story about death-row. But dig deeper and you will find it is also a story about mystical healing and man's inability to believe in something we can't understand.</p></body></html>

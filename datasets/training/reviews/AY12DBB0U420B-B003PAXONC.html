<meta name="summary" content="Excellent NYC Depiction. Awful Monsters. Preposterous Script."></head><body><p>Last night's bargain-rack movie was "I Am Legend" starring Will Smith. I got it at Wal-Mart off the five-dollar rack. First of all, I was unaware of the movie or the book on which it was based. Second, my feelings for the movie are extremely mixed. First, my reaction to the discovery of a cancer cure which morphs into a rabies-like virus and wipes out the Manhattan population is skeptical, to say the least. Well, I know this is unadulterated fiction, so I'll try to give it some slack. But secondly, the depiction of Manhattan as a devastated city is exceptionally good and I'm left wondering how in the world did they ever do it? The streets are cluttered with cars as if everything was just abandoned after the sounding of an alarm. After three years, all the streets are overgrown with mature-sized weeds growing from cracks in the pavement wherever Smith might go, and he covers a lot of territory. The city looks completely abandoned and in bad decay. Well Done! Whoever put this together ought to get an award of some type. And, alas, from this as a start, I would expect a really good movie to follow.<br /><br />Well, this well-crafted scene just doesn't hold up. Smith has an office-laboratory where he labors to save the world and it is fully electrified. Full lighted. All the machines work. It even has a working TV. And the computer works, including the internet. And his car works fine as he motors about the city, never getting low on gas, although he's been there three years. And he sends a broadcast out over the airwaves of the city ever day trying to find out if anyone else might be there. Huh? How could this be? It just doesn't wash. All of a sudden I find myself involved in a story I couldn't possibly believe. At about this point, there's the appearance of human-like monsters and monster dogs which are infected with a rabies-like virus and are insanely violent and after his hide. I'm sorry folks, the story just lost me totally and I just couldn't bear the last half.<br /><br />The movie had promise. Too bad the last half wasn't up to the first half. As it is, I'd have to congratulate some of the special effects people (the NYC scene)  and let the others know what an awful job they did (the monsters). What an incongruent mix! Who's responsible for this mess anyway?. Well, I'd have to say that Smith's acting was fairly good. My condolences to him for being stuck in such a preposterous script.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

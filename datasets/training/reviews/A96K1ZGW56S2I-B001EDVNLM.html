<meta name="summary" content="The Best Bond Ever?"></head><body><p>In some ways, DIE ANOTHER DAY is the best Bond movie ever. I mean, after the action-packed opening scene through the 49th Parrellel in Korea; James Bond is captured by the North Koreans and sent to type of POW camp. The plot remains fairly tight (considering this is a Bond picture), there are all sorts of new gadgets (and glimpses of ones from the past), lots of witty one-liners and double entredes, great action, and two stunningly-beautiful babes.  The movie constantly play on the Bond-format, but does so in such a way that it shakes things up and makes the franchise seem more alive and current.<p>Nevertheless, with all it has going for it, there is one major flaw to the film.  James Bond movies used to be fairly believable (see the first two Bond movies), but it seems that as each new film is made, the creators see just how far they can go to push the believability button. There aren't a lot of things in this movie that question one's suspension of disbelief. However, there are a few and they are so huge that it counters all the good things this film has going for it.  For instance, the plane/helicopter escape at the film's climax. I felt like I was watching a bad sci-fi movie when that scene happened. There could have been several other more crafty ways to have Bond escape, but instead they went for the most extreme.<p>However, other than that, DIE ANOTHER DAY is one heck of a good James Bond adventure.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What Women Want"></head><body><p>It's easy to dismiss this flick as fluff.  But men who would ordinarily sniff their noses should see this film as a primer to the psyche of women.  I went to see this film last summer when it was in the theatres with my fiancee(now wife).  What caused her to sit at the edge of her seat was not the story or the superb acting but the proliferation of high-end brand names (Gucci, etc.) and the parade of "Style" channel celebrities(Valentino? Who?).  It made me feel cheap for giving her a Coach handbag for her birthday.  What elevates this film is the excellent performances by the ensemble cast.  Meryl Streep as a high fashion Cruella De Ville gives a nuanced performance that is the stuff of legend.  Emily Blunt (should be Oscar nominated) follows close behind as Streep's snooty assistant.  The underrated Stanley Tucci as a magazine staffer gives a performance bereft of stereotype.  Anne Hathaway, probably inspired by the talent around her, holds her own with this talented cast.  To summarize, this flick is froth with substance.</p></body></html>

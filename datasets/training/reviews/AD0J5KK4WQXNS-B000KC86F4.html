<meta name="summary" content="3 x X2"></head><body><p>You wouldn't miss that Bryan Singer is gone, maybe even a good move, as X3 is 3 times what X2 was, with Brett Ratner (Red Draqon) amping up the action, character arcs (many of which come to a surprising end, quite literally) and just pounding action sequence after action sequence onto the big screen, which is exactly where X3 should be seen, in all its widescreen glory. Explaining any second of this movie would just spoil the surprises in store and tear-jerkers, of which there are many, like the number of mutants on display, including Beast and the New, and deeply unsettling, Dr. Jean Grey, now the dark Phoenix, who will blow you away... and everything else she comes in contact with. X3 is where the summer blockbusters begin. Finally we have something worth getting in queue for again. What are you waiting for? Leave your home this weekend and GO!</p></body></html>

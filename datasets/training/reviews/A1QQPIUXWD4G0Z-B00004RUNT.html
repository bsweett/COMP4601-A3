<meta name="summary" content="An Original and Comedic Sci-Fi Adventure"></head><body><p>Luc Besson's (The Professional; The Messenger) movie is a humor-laden sience fiction adventure film with motifs borrowed and cleverly adapted from virtually every other science fiction film that preceded it. The main plot seems to be a cohesive compilation of all of the individual short stories in the animated film &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; (i.e. the Lok-nar: the evil orb seking to destroy huamnity, the flying cab driver, Taarna the flying protectress who's brought in to save humanity, etc.) A lot of the futuristic stage design seems to be borrowed from Ridley Scott's &quot;Blade Runner.&quot;<br /><br /> Bruce Willis was o.k. in the film but seems to be just another version of his &quot;Die Hard&quot; character: &quot;This is how you negotiate!&quot; Although some reviewers found Chris Tucker to be annoying, that's exactly the character he was asked to play in this movie, an annoying, wimpy, effeminate, and talkative DJ. Mila Jojovich's role as Milou was irritating with the nonsensical baby da-da talk. The best performance was by Gary Oldman as the evil industrialist, Zorg.<br /><br /> Overall, the movie is a great action comedy sci-fi. The special effects along with the acting are pretty good to make one want to see this film more than once.</p></body></html>

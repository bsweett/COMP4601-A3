<meta name="summary" content="Four-and-a-half stars for one of the best contemporary war dramas"></head><body><p>Quite frankly, one of the best war movies I've ever seen. "The Hurt Locker" focuses on what it is to actually be addicted to war and the repercussions on those who not only crave it (through the character portrayed by Jeremy Renner), but those who are scared of it (Geraghty) and those who don't understand it (Mackie). Renner, who I've always thought to be a great actor starting with 2002's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A2X3MU">Dahmer</a> and 2003's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008EYA5">S.W.A.T. (Widescreen Special Edition)</a>, takes the lead in this drama as a rebel bomb squad technician who lives on the edge with every bomb he diffuses. An equally impressive Anthony Mackie (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPBO">We Are Marshall (Widescreen Edition)</a>) plays the spotter on his team, with Geraghty playing the assistant specialist.<br /><br />Most might brush this film off as just another war movie made by the liberal media. However, I believe it's anything but just that. What makes this one of the best war films I've seen is that it doesn't so much as focus on just the action as it does on the humanity itself as well as the psychological toll that comes with fighting a war in a country where anyone can -- and most likely will -- kill you. Add the constant unease of being in a job that is as dangerous as bomb diffusion (where every move might be your last) and it's no surprise to see the mental toll it takes on the three central characters. Each moment these guys go into the field, director Kathryn Bigelow easily conveys (with the help of Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders' on-edge score) the tense moments that fill any soldier's life during war.<br /><br />Bigelow deserved the Directors Guild Of America award for Best Director and the Oscar. The way this film was shot mostly had the feel of a documentary more than a major Hollywood motion picture. And that (along with using mostly slightly unknown actors) helped the believability of the story. I especially liked that the well-known actors used in the film were more like cameos and were not followed throughout the story (Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, David Morse, Evangeline Lilly).<br /><br />For those who don't mind seeing films about war, this should be a must. For those who don't even like war films, you should still give it a try as I find it an essential viewing -- not just in cinema, but also for any film that truly encapsulates a post-9/11 world.</p></body></html>

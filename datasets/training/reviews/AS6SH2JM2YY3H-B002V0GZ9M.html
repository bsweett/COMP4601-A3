It will not be any kind of classic, but it will leave most viewers with a pleasant "aftertaste".  Keanu Reeves is a builder/architect who mysteriously begins a "cross-time" correspondence with Sandra Bullock, a new doctor.  Interestingly, it's not the Lake House (a house on stilts designed and built by Reeve's father) that is at the nexus of these two lives; it is the mailbox.  The mailbox is the mechanism for allowing messages to pass from Reeves (in 2004) to Bullock (in 2006).  Once they realize that they live in two different times, they demonstrate a surprising lack of interest in how or why this is happening, a bit unrealistic for two professionals (and their friends).  And apparently anything can pass in the mailbox (they pass a book and letters); what a great opportunity to pass a newspaper, flowers, jewelry... whatever!<br /><br />BUT... this is a love story, with a couple separated not by space, but by time.  There is a touching scene when they make a date to meet.  For him, it is a date two years in the future.  For her, it is tomorrow.  Note the resemblance to An Affair to Remember, starring Cary Grant.<br /><br />I thought Keanu Reeves was well cast for this movie.  Sandra Bullock was perhaps too "relaxed" for the physician... everything was too matter-of-fact.  All's well that ends well, and this plot ends well.<br /><br />I'd like to be the first to announce that the dog, Jack, was really an alien with time-warping abilities.  She (yes, Jack was a she) hid it well, and there was probably a huge alien complex hidden in the water under the Lake House causing these distortions in time.  But that's another story.  This one was a tale of love!</p></body></html>

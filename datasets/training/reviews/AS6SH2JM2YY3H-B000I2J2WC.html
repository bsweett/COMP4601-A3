<meta name="summary" content="Much better than expected!"></head><body><p>With all the hoopla about the length of Tom Hank's hair, and the scenes in the book that were not included in the movie, and so on, I didn't have the highest expectations for the movie version of The Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />However, it was better than expected.  I agree with the critics who think the actors are rather aloof.  This had Harrison Ford written all over it.  BUT... the story propels the movie forward.<br /><br />I had read the book twice, and I went to see the movie with friends, three who had read the book, and two who did not.  All liked the movie, but the two who did not read the book thought it was a bit confusing.  Two of us, one who had read the book and one who didn't, thought the beginning quite boring, and almost fell asleep!  Alas, that included me.<br /><br />Critics and supporters of The Da Vinci Code seem to be fixated on what is real and what is fiction.  Who cares?  For those who depend on Dan Brown for historical analysis, you should expand your reading.  For those who want to support, or discredit, Opus Dei and the Catholic Church, you probably don't need this movie (or the book) to hold up your thesis.<br /><br />Whatever your politics, look at the movie as entertainment.  If you do, you will find The Da Vinci Code better than expected.  But I wish the first thirty minutes had a little more "pep"...</p></body></html>

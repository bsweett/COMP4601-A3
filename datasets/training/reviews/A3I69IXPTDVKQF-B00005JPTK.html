<meta name="summary" content="Post-Apocalyptic Horror/Drama With A Spiritual Edge"></head><body><p>In "I Am Legend" the apocalypse has hit the world, a man-made virus intended for good, intended to cure cancer, but gone horribly awry.  On a planet now populated by hordes of mutated, vampire-like victims of the plague, a surviving military scientist (Will Smith, in his best performance), somehow immune to the disease, works in a fortified house to find a cure, walking the city with his canine companion in search of specimens to test various experimental treatments on, and in search for survivors.<br /><br />  He's set up a radio transmitter that sends out messages on all frequencies urging any other survivors to meet him at a certain time and place to band together, but day after day, year after year, he finds no one there to meet him.  Interspersed with the post-apocalyptic time frame we see frequent flashbacks showing the early days when the 'cure' was going wrong, and global panic was breaking out.  The plague victims are nightmarish creatures, shirking from the sun, ravenous, violent and mindless.  During the nights the doctor barricades himself and his companion inside the house, but the ghastly creatures are out there, always.  It's a bleak world being presented, but done well.  I've noted before that 'bleak' is among the hardest moods to do right in a movie, but I Am Legend does it brilliantly.  Part of it is that the grim mood is punctuated by touches of the idyllic: the abandoned city beginning to look alive again as all this beautiful greenery creeps in, deer bounding about...but there's nothing idyllic or peaceful once you get into the shadows where the creatures dwell.  One of the creatures, in particular, is especially disturbing: he seems much smarter than the others, seems angrier than the others, and the others are starting to follow his lead.<br /><br />  **WARNING: POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD***<br /><br />  Eventually, Smith's character does come across another survivor, two actually: a woman and her little boy.  Instead of just relief, tension soon follows.  Smith has by this point become utterly defeated psychologically and spiritually - he no longer believes there's any hope of his finding a way of reversing the mutation, he's lost faith in just about everything, and he reacts with disbelief and almost anger as she claims God guided her to him, and her claims that an entire colony of survivors is out there waiting for them.<br /><br />  Where the movie goes from here I'll refrain from hinting at, but it continues developing.  A lot of what happens in the latter parts are highly interpretative, and fascinating.  The movie does miss a couple of opportunities, and is a bit slow in places, but those minor hindrances are blown away by the overall power of the movie.  Emotional, at times frightening, at times spiritual, boasting great cinematography and great performances from a cast that has some very demanding material, I Am Legend is among the top movies of 2007.  9/10</p></body></html>

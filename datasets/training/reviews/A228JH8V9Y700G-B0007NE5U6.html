<meta name="summary" content="Bridget gone wild"></head><body><p>Rene Zellweger packed on the pounds once again to play Bridget Jones in the sequel to her successful run in the first movie.  WHile three years passed in real life until the second movie was made, it has only been a few weeks since Bridget found her happiness with Mark Darcy.  She is happy as can be, with her winner of a boyfriend, and enjoying an all around happy streak in life.  Soon, however, she is on shakey ground.<br /><br />She fears that Mark is turning his affections towards the new hot number in his law firm.  Her paranoia is rising, as she sees the other woman's bright smiles and her appearences at every outing she and Mark go on.  Out of the blue, Daniel Cleaver, the cad who played her, reappears in her newly aquired field of television reporting.  Convinced that Mark is cheating, Bridget goes on an ill advised and irrational trip to Thailand with Daniel Cleaver for business which will inevitably turn into pleasure.<br /><br />It wasn't as good as the first one, as there were no big surprises.  Daniel will inevitably cheat on her and be caught like in the first one.  Bridget will end up in some terrible mess again (getting thrown in the Thai jail - and notice how all the cellmates speak English marginally well?).  And Mark will come to her rescue once more and bail her out.  Still, it was a good time, with Bridget's bumbling antics.  SHe can laugh at herself, as we can all laugh at ourselves.  And if you can't laugh at yourself, than you're even stupider than others think we are.</p></body></html>

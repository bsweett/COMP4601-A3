<meta name="summary" content="With the death of Spock, Star Trek reaches its apex"></head><body><p>&quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; remains the best of the Star Trek movies. Yes, &quot;The Voyage Home&quot; was more fun, but the franchise is never going to be able to top the emotional impact of Spock's death. &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; is what we would have called a first-rate &quot;B&quot; movie in the old days. This is William Shatner's finest performance, helped by the fact that there is a telling subplot about Kirk worrying that he is growing old. Consequently, the character is given some significant depth whether he is dealing with having to put his spectacles on in front of the bridge crew or trying to come to terms with suddenly confronting a son who wants nothing to do with him. I also think Shatner's performance is helped by the fact that Kirk has to solve problems by thinking rather than by slugging anyone. In fact, Shatner won the Saturn Award from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, USA for his performance (director Nicholas Meyer won as well). <p>The emotional impact of the death of Spock is something that was set up from early on in the Star Trek television series where it became clear that despite their vast differences the Captain and his First Officer had become friends. This is a theme that has been touched upon by various television episodes as well as in some of the better Star Trek novels that have dealt with the formation of that friendship. The symbolism of the plastic shielding that separates them at the end, a physical manifestation of the psychological barriers required by the Vulcan part of Spock, is certainly not lost on us. With all the &quot;Buddy&quot; movies Hollywood has produced, I cannot think of a more emotional declaration that &quot;I have been and always shall be your friend.&quot; Yes, it was something that was so well understood that it never needed to be said, but it was still worth hearing.<p>Both the direction and the score are first rate and I am especially fond of the sequences where the bridge crew is waiting helplessly for Genesis to detonate. The camera moves in on each character as they discuss their impending deaths and the music matches the pace only to turn ominously when the scene cuts back to the dying Khan. However, I must note that director Nicholas Meyer used the same series of jump cuts to pull away from the Reliant before Genesis detonates that he did with Kansas City when the nuclear missiles hit in &quot;The Day After.&quot; I also think composer James Horner deserves credit for setting the tone with the marvelous opening fanfare and heroic theme. Even before we get to the Kobayashi Maru sequence, you know this is going to be a good flick. <p>The only thing that really bugs me about this movie is that Khan keeps quoting Ahab. Obviously his obsession is reminiscent of &quot;Moby Dick,&quot; but if you were a super genius would you really want to have Ahab as your role model? I understand how the allusion fits from the perspective of the director/writer/audience, but not from the perspective of Khan's character. Then again, besides &quot;Moby Dick&quot; one of the other books that Khan had on Ceti Alpha VI was &quot;King Lear,&quot; which also features a main character with mental problems. Remember, this is a guy who quoted Milton at the end of &quot;Space Seed,&quot; so I do not think he should suddenly be going off the deep end with his literary references. Ricardo Montalban's flamboyant performance as Khan not only works as he chews up the scenery with such delight, but because I think it is another significant reason that Shatner toned down his performance, thereby creating a nice contrast between the two characters. <p>With regards to the disappointing DVD version, which contains nothing extra besides the trailer despite the fact &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; aired on ABC with additional footage (e.g., establishing Preston as Scotty's nephew). I believe we are being sandbagged and that once they sell out on this initial run of Star Trek films on DVD we will suddenly get Director's Cuts or Special Editions that will suddenly provide all of the things Paramount should have put on these DVDs in the first place.

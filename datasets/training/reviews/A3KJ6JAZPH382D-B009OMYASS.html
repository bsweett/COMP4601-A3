<meta name="summary" content="It's such a brutal planet"></head><body><p>This movie is so schizophrenic that you may think you're in the wrong theater for the first half. A pair of ugly American tourists and their found-along-the-way buddy from Iceland run around Europe in a typical obscenity laden attempt to score as much nookie and pot as they can consume, and are basically rude and spoiled obnoxious turds. (And in typical xenophobic fashion, guess which of the three tourons gets offed first? Hint: He didn't have an American Passport...). In fact, the first part of the film is a cross between a tour advertisement for the gorgeous nature of Europe - "Hostel" has some amazing cinematography - and a soft core porn flick. B**bies? Everywhere.<br /><br />But then comes the evil that "Hostel" is being sold as. Those hot babes? They are evil femme fatales selling out cute tourists to a place where you can pay to have your sickest fantasies played out. (And in another telling undercurrent of conscious, is it odd that the only sick designs that anyone has involve the brutal torture and murder of the victims? And that an American victim fetches the best price? No fantasy hot sex? Oh wait, the ones who have the hot sex fantasies are getting murdered! It's back to the old slasher rule of 70's horror...lower head gets too much action, upper head will get decapitated.)<br /><br />Ok, so I did sit on the edge of my seat for most of the film's second and third segments. You don't get much actual horror from the movie itself, there's a lot of obvious screaming and flying body parts, but no direct shot of said torture (like no-one in the theater I was in could tell the difference...pah). By the film's third act, it's devolved into a cat-and-mouse game of escape with revenge as the primary motivational drive.<br /><br />But with the lead characters in the movie being such dorkwad tourist-morons ('tourons'), the early killing doesn't elicit much sympathy. In fact, with the news of 2005 and early 2006 reporting that the American military is all to happy to ship suspects out the country and off of the radar screen to be "questioned" (hah!) without the quaint regulations of those pesky activist courts, then how hard is it to imagine a place like "Hostel" in a corrupt county where those rules do not apply? And how disturbed will you be when the scene where the little kids turn from candy-chompers to skull-stompers? Or will you, like some in the theater I saw "Hostel" in, cheer them on?<br /><br />Maybe the earlier analogy of "Hostel" to those 70's slasher flicks was not quiet complete. "Hostel" may be more appropriately compared to those 50's and 60's mutant movies where our national subconscious used atomically enhanced critters to scare us into fearing the Cold War. "Hostel" uses images of foreigners running a tourist death-camp to remind us that all it takes is one sleazy non-American with a bankroll to off as many citizens and sympathizers as he can, as long as your willing to pay for the privilege. Quentin Tarantino backing Eli Roth to issue political allegory as horror films? Hey, stranger things have happened.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It ain't over yet"></head><body><p>Even in this new era of Russian and American friendship<br />into which this film came, there are still atomic bombs on both sides.<br />Technically the handling of people in the bomb area in this film is very wrong : at the hospital and on the streets.<br />Everyone is taught that the ashes from the bomb are as deadly as the bomb itself. No one was doing decontaminations here.<br />The brinkmanship here was classic and the Jack Ryan as good as ever.<br />Tom Clancy is a very good spy/ suspense writer, he just doesn't seem to know that much about atomic bombs.</p></body></html>

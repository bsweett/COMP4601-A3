<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick's last best movie."></head><body><p>It is strange that Kubrick would choose to revisit the theme of war, considering that he had already conquered the genre with the classic controversial `Paths of Glory' and had done a variation of the theme for `Spartacus', the war comedy `Dr. Strangelove', `Full Metal Jacket', a war film, seems an unlikely career choice, given that Kubrick had not made a film in 7 years since `The Shining', this happens to be his second last film, made in the UK London docks in 1987, it would be 12 years before Kubrick would film again, the somewhat average `Eyes Wide Shut', making this probably his last best film.<br /><br />FMJ is a well made war film full of interesting characters (lots of them) and stunning set pieces - Boot camp and the final war torn city sniper search being the most memorable, FMJ is not exactly original, but the fact that when Kubrick does it right then it usually turns out great, this is another Vietnam war film, that is very good, period. Even though R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman has almost the exact same lines as Louis Gossett Jr., playing Sgt. Emil Foley in `An Officer and a Gentleman', you will watch him in FMJ more than turning to the Richard Gere vehicle. Even though you have seen it all before, it is still worth watching because the set pieces are just done well and the acting is quite good, most noticeably, D'Onofrio as Pyle, cracking under the pressure of drill training and eventually turning on his own squad.<br /><br />FMJ is a two part story, Boot Camp and then War, the newly fresh Marine Corps recruits becoming death, deciding fate, taking action, suffering consequences, `The Draft' a prison for the recruit who should not be there, section 8s everywhere, killers who do not know why they are in Vietnam thrust into the Tet offensive head-on, most of them have peace symbols but will they kill?... or be killed<br /><br />Although quite violent and bloody Kubrick mostly chooses psychology. There is not much to it other than to show the horror of war from the viewpoint that it is just such a mixed bag, from those who are afraid to pull the trigger, to full blown adult criminal sadists leading the men to victory. Kubrick captures Vietnam quite well and Full Metal Jacket is certainly an important film in any collection, as it will be watched time and time again for the high production values and strong acting. Although it might not carry that much of a message like `Paths of Glory' did, it certainly doesn't shy away from showing us the horror of war.<br /><br />As a note this is a PAN and SCAN movie, shot in 1.85 : 1, it was shown in this aspect ratio in the US and then in 1.66 : 1 in Europe. Kurbick did not want to release this in widescreen or even flat. He filmed it specifically for the video market and television's PAN AND SCAN.</p></body></html>

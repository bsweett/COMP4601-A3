So when this film appeared on cable I went out of my way to plan a viewing; now, having seen BRIDESMAIDS several times, I will be adding this hysterical romp to my movie collection.  BRIDESMAIDS is laugh out loud funny; it's snorting your drink through your nose funny; it's rolling on the couch funny.  Kristen Wiig leads this exceptional cast as insecure, self-destructive Annie, a woman with a knack for picking loser boyfriends (Jon Hamm in an uncredited role), with her best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), getting married--and asking Annie to be her Maid of Honor.  Among the other bridesmaids is the beautiful, organized, and filthy rich Helen (Rose Byrne), who is vying to become Lillian's new best friend. . .and the cat fight is on, with knee slapping results and donkey-braying comedic bliss.<br /><br />This is not your Aunt Edna's comedy; this film has a decided raunchy edge, from total anarchy on a flight to Vegas, to a food poisoning attack during a dress fitting.  ("It's coming out of me like lava!" proclaims Melissa McCarthy, part of the bridesmaid ensemble and an unabashed scene stealer.)  If seeing the female gender push the envelope into locker room humor makes you uncomfortable, BRIDESMAIDS is not for you.  Wiig aptly carries the freight, and her genuine chemistry with Rudolph is no doubt a byproduct of their years together on SNL.  You'll feel a twinge of sadness seeing Jill Clayburgh, playing Annie's mom, who died just a few months before the film's release.  One star off for the inevitable "chick flick" moments, including a sappy Wilson Phillips sing-a-long, along with an ending that was strangely wanting.  But who cares?  If you're looking for belly laughs by the barrel, BRIDESMAIDS is right down your alley.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.</p></body></html>

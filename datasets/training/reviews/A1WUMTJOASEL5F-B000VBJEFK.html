<meta name="summary" content="Monsieur RAT in the kitchen"></head><body><p>This is a very well made story animation project where a picky rat who learns how to cook is discovered by a Paris restaurant garbage boy who uses the rat to present himself as the blossoming star cook. The startling thing about this project is the fact that the rats in the story are more loveable than the annoying humans. I cant think of one, not one, loveable endearing human in this movie, they are all despicable. Even the upscale food critic is a pompous individual who tries to stand in as a sort of villain figure but later becomes the good guy. Linguini drives me up the wall. His rants of "I'm insane, I'm insane, I'm insane!" only makes me nod my head. The chef is a bumbling idiot miniature monster, and the cook girlfriend is a domineering over eager woman in the field of men. Welcome to reality!<br />Remy is the only character that makes sense, a rebel with a cause. A cause to upgrade the status of rathood with choosing your food, and making it wisely. And he does, he uses his rat sense to make supreme cuisine, as well as his philosophy. His rat friends and family are all in this together, but it takes quite awhile to stir up the sense of togetherness, as most don't always agree with his fortitude. Fine job by Pixar, and just another well made nitch on their menu of animated pleasures.</p></body></html>

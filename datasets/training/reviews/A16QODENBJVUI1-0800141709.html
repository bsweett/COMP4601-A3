<meta name="summary" content="The premier film classic of the Cold War"></head><body><p>DR. STRANGELOVE is many things to many people.  It is one of the most brilliant dark comedies every made.  It is one of the most powerful protests against military insanity ever created.  It is Peter Sellers greatest film, and Stanley Kubrick's greatest film.  And, to one disgruntled soul who left the theater screaming in disgust at how "it makes a mockery of our country's military!" it is a denunciation of the American "strength through power" mindset.  It is also the most deadpan film ever made.  <p>I know of few films that contain so many utterly perfect moments as this one.  Kubrick's brilliance is the way he takes these potentially disparate moments and blends them into a magnificent, coherent whole.  Anyone who has seen STRANGELOVE will have his or her own set of best moments.  Mine includes:  George C. Scott's obsessive gum chewing; Peter Sellers as the president shouting, "You can't fight in here, this is the War Room!"; General Jack Ripper's disquisition on bodily fluids; Kennan Wynn's Col. "Bat" Guano warning Capt. Mandrake that he will have to answer to the Coca Cola company; everything that Slim Pickens says throughout the film; "When Johnny Comes Marching Home"; President Muffley's long phone conversation with Dmitri, the Soviet premier; and, last, but not least, Dr. Strangelove himself (who resembles nothing so much as FDR if he had been an insane ex-Nazi).<p>In 1964, when this film was made, the idea of nuclear war was horrific to everyone.  Bomb shelters were being sold everywhere, and one of the hot exhibitions at any State Fair would be the one displaying the shelter models out that year.  Numerous movies were made trying to drive home the seriousness of the threat.  But Kubrick, instead, made a comedy about it, partly, unquestionably, to point up the absurdity of the entire situation.  But perhaps also to give us some perspectives on ourselves, on our tendency to demonize "the other," on our silly assumptions, and perhaps as a way of deflating some of the tension of the situation by helping us all to laugh at ourselves.  There have been many "topical" films made over the decades, but perhaps none has managed to so completely transcend its particular period of time as to become a masterpiece for any and all times.</p></body></html>

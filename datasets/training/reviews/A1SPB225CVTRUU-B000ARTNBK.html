It turns out that they pretty much used the best parts of the film to be the trailer. I didn't find it to be as entertaining as other recent comic book movies like Batman Begins or Sin City, and the characters are rather weak. Michael Chiklis' The Thing is pretty outstanding, but his super power is not very striking. The telekinetic power used by Jessica Biel(Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman) is somewhat of a copycat to Famke Janssen's role in X-Men. Couldn't they get someone as famous and sexy as Ryan Reynolds to play Johnny Storm/The Human Torch instead of Chris Evans. Ioan Gruffudd's role as Mr. Fantastic is my least favorite, and the romantic subplot involving Sue Storm and him was bland and irrelevant to the movie. As for the villian Victor Von Doom played by Julian McMahon was hardly evil enough, and he had too little action to tackle. The spcial effects were pretty good, and the final showdown was impressive. This film suffers from poor story, not enough fantastic battles, and star power.</p></body></html>

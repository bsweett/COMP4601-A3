You see, it was Tyson's reputation that intimidated them.  I believe this is what we have when it comes to Quentin Tarantino's films; it is his reputation for being an "auteur" that proceeds his releases.  People think this a guy who does "out of the box," conglomerations of spaghetti westerns, blaxploitation films, his quirky musical tastes, etc. and mixes it all together-and according to them, out comes a great movie.  "Inglourious Basterds" is one of those films, BUT closer examination reveals the film does have flaws.  Tarantino gets away with long, boring scenes of dialog building up to a climactic event just because he is, well, Tarantino.  Another filmmaker would simply be taken to task for these trangressions, but we're dealing with a "genius" here, so he gets a free pass by critics and fans.  IB does have much to crow about: beautiful cinematography, great action scenes (when they finally show up), and good performances, but film is all about timing and pacing, and this is where the movie loses focus.  No doubt Tarantino devotees will say "but that is how he does it," but to me and many other moviegoers it's still plodding at a snails pace.  In the end, "Inglourious Basterds" just moved to slowly for me to really enjoy it.</p></body></html>

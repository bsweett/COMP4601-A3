Mission: Impossible 3 fits the bill quite nicely, thank you.<br /><br />This third offering finds us reunited with a more relaxed Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), now steeped in humdrumness and enjoying domestic bliss with his nurse girlfriend Julia (Michelle Monaghan), who is unaware of Ethan's spy vocation. He's still with his agency, the IMF (Impossible Missions Force, not at all cheesy, huh?), but is no longer a field agent, content now with merely training new recruits.  Billy Cruddup plays Musgrave, Ethan's handler, who busts Ethan's bubble of normalcy and convinces him to return to the field and head up a rescue operation, the particular hostage-in-distress (Keri Russell, in an extended cameo role) being an agent Ethan himself had personally trained. The main baddie is Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), untouchable supplier to various terrorist factions, and the one who's holding our IMF agent captive. Alas, the rescue op doesn't go well and the agency's director Theodore Brassel (Laurence Fishburne) is royally pissed at Ethan and Musgrave. Ethan then decides to capture Davian, is successful, but Davian escapes, in a massive firefight on a bridge. Quickly after, Julia is kidnapped and Davian gives Ethan a deadline to obtain something called the Rabbit's Foot, or else...but enough of the plot, now go see the rest of it.<br /><br />Going into a Mission: Impossible movie, I expect non-stop action, great technical special effects, awesome stunts, various double dealings, a few latex mask disguises, cool secret agent toys, hot ladies, a loyal Ving Rhames, and a determined Tom Cruise. And all of the above, I got in spades. I don't really look for a coherent plot in this series but I was surprised how well this one actually held up. Every scene here made sense and meshed nicely, whereas, in the first two M:I flicks I found myself scratching my noggin on few occasions.<br /><br />The set pieces and stunts were up to snuff, convincing and slick. The film takes you to locations such as Germany, Vatican City, Shanghai and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. As usual, Tom Cruise does a fair number of stunts. Meanwhile, director J.J. Abrams keeps things fast-moving and on point. In the grand Hitchcock tradition, he winks at the audience and plays fast and loose with the movie's MacGuffin, the Rabbit's Foot. It draws a chuckle out of me that the Rabbit's Foot never was properly detailed.<br /><br />The cast is solid. This isn't a Shakespeare play, this is a no-holds-barred summer action movie, so for what it is, the actors do a very good job. Tom Cruise, of course, is the glue of the franchise and, as always, he really doesn't have to do much as a thespian except muster up sheer intensity. Ving Rhames is his same cool, dependable self (you could never have too much Ving). Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Maggie Q are competent but bland as Ethan's crew, though Maggie looks very hot in her red party dress (you'll see). Michelle Monaghan as Julia, Ethan's girlfriend, is beautiful and exudes wholesomeness; she gets to have her own pretty implausible but nevertheless kick-ass scene late in the film. Laurence Fishburne as the IMF director is properly dictatorial, while Billy Cruddup as Musgrave is properly subservient in Fishburne's presence, yet manages to find ways to covertly thumb his nose at his boss. Philip Seymour Hoffman, not too surprisingly, does the best job here, putting a decidedly vicious bite in his Owen Davian persona. One particular scene Hoffman has with Cruise in the plane, when Cruise attempts to interrogate him and fails miserably, pretty much sums up the arrogance and venom of his despicable character. All in all, some credible actors here. But I miss Thandie Newton.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a fun summer movie, why not check this one out? And by the way, should you ever find out what the hell the Rabbit's Foot is, please tell me.</p></body></html>

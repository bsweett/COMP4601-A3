Its just another twnetysomething angst/finding love story.  It has some mildly amusing parts and Zach Braff does a good job in the lead role, but there is nothing really original in the movie.  I used to think Natalie Portman saved all of her bad acting for the Star Wars movies, but she is wooden and annoying in this one as well.  This movie is worth a rent if your're bored, but you may end up even more bored while watching it.</p></body></html>

I remember it being released in 1973, people were pickiting our local theater which just caused more people to see it. I was to young, I was only 7, but did see it on HBO years later. Wish I would have waited a few more years, I had nightmares way to often, to the point where I found myself in Mom and Dads bed. Simple story of a young girl overcome by demonic possesion, and the toll it takes on the mother and the priests who are performing the exorcism. I do own this dvd but I refuse to watch it without some company, and I'm 38 now. The demonic voice of Reagan,(Linda Blair), over my eight Polk speakers in DTS sound is enough to raise the hair on your neck. How they managed to get away with the crucifix scene without a cut from the M.P.A.A. blows me away. The most disturbing scene ever, in any film. I could do without the newly added "nervous disorder" scene in the hospital, but the "spiderwalk" scene is chilling, and should have been in the original cut. And how about that score? Tubular bells just freaks me out. A wonderful directed, edited, scored, acted film. The best horror film ever. How Linda Blair can even sleep today, astonishes me. Dick Smith was the makeup artist, I believe Max Von Sydow, head priest, was only in his 40s at the time, look at him now, he looks exactley like his aged makeup, incredible. Tom Savini, fx God learned from Mr. Smith. Damn, do I love movies.</p></body></html>

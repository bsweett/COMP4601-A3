Generally I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, and my previous Jamie Foxx film experience was only Booty Call(I've since seen Ray).  The only reason I watched this movie was that Michael Mann directed it.<br /><br />I'll have to admit that the premise was intriguing to say the least, but ultimately the back and forth banter between Cruise & Fox is what elevated this film into a nerve wracking, white knuckle suspense ride; halfway through you're not sure if you're strapped in properly, but you don't care, because what's going down on screen is so damn cool.  I actually found myself wishing I'd seen this in theaters.  Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the viewing experience.<br /><br />The level of cruelty and violence Cruise's assassin displays was altogether unexpected.  It's absurd and flinch worthy, almost cartoony at times, but it always is presented with flair and style.  In fact the whole movie comes off as something you might see in a graphic novel.  Pretty cool stuff to see get Hollywood backing.<br /><br />Also, as a very nice added bonus feature you get the incredibly beautiful Jada Pinkett Smith (that Fresh Prince is one heckuva lucky guy) as the damsel in distress.<br /><br />When all is said and done what you get is a witty action/drama that never seems to let up.  I imagine any taxi driver after seeing this film became very wary of picking up white haired Caucasians.  That alone is hilarious enough to make me recommend this movie.</p></body></html>

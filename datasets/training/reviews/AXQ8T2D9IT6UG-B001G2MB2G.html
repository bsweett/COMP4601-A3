The reason for that opinion is that J. K. Rowling's books include lots of details that you don't get to enjoy in the movies, probably due to lack of time. That problem is more noticeable with the new movies, that try to stay faithful to the spirit of the books, and generally do so, but leaving many charming subplots behind, something I cannot help but regret.<br /><br />Thankfully, I've read all the books in the Harry Potter series so far, and plan on reading the last one next week. I can sincerely say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but that I wish it could have been longer.<br /><br />I would like to highlight the fact that the actors that play the main characters (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson) keep getting better at their craft in each movie, and that the new director, David Yates, does an excellent job of trying to convey the gloomy mood of book 5, without losing the funny moments that make these books so special. The new additions to the cast were also excellent, specially Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood and Helena Bonham Carter as a very scary Bellatrix Lestrange.<br /><br />On the whole, I highly recommend this movie, but I advise you to read the books first, because only then will you be able to enjoy the whole "Harry Potter experience"  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></body></html>

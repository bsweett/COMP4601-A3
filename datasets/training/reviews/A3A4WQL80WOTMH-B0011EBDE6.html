<meta name="summary" content="Like No Train You'd Find In India"></head><body><p>I watched this movie with my two Indian, yoga-teacher neighbors. I kind of feared the worst with Hollywood actors doing their thing - in India. But I was pleasantly surprised. I've been to India twice and felt that except for the 'inside the train' scenes themselves, India was more or less realistically conveyed, and the actors (or story) didn't have them making total fools of themselves.  Well, except for when they bought that poisonous snake, maybe.. but basically they were likeable.<br /><br />Much of the story seemed to be taking place in Rajasthan, or along the lines of the middle north west (you won't see Darjeeling). It was beautifully shot, though truth be told, it's not hard to get beautiful shots in India. Still, I've seen movies shot in other countries (which I've been to) that completely do not capture the feeling of the place and people. This one rather does (minus the 'on-the-train' scenes), though focus is on the actors of course. It's not bad riding along with them on a journey through India. If you ever wondered what it might be like looking out the window while riding through, say Rajasthan, here's your chance.</p></body></html>

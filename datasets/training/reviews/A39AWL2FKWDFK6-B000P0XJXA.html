<meta name="summary" content="Another government cover up"></head><body><p>Under the fine direction of David Mamet "Spatan" meanders forward in somewhat baffling fashion to establish that a young woman with high government connections has been abducted.  Lethal and obedient covert government operative Val Kilmer leads the investigation into the kidnapping.  Together with inexperienced partner Derek Luke they follow a series of clues to learn that the girl has been kidnapped by a white slavery operation.  North American girls are seized and funneled to Dubai where they are sold.<p>We later find out that that young woman abducted was none other than the daughter of the president.  This brings a stern, no nonsense Ed O'Neil, head of the Secret Service into command of the investigation.  Aided by a smarmy William H. Macy, O'Neil orders the investigation terminated when the body of the president's daughter washes ashore in Martha's Vineyard, the apparent victim of a boating accident.<p>Failing to believe the girl is really dead Kilmer and Luke continue their probing which unearths an unexpected deep government conspiracy.<p>Mamet is a talented director and Spartan is an excellent example of his skill. All the actors are very convincing in their roles with special kudos to Kilmer and O'Neil.</p></body></html>

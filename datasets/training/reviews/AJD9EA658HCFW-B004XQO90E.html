<meta name="summary" content="Hooks you right away!!"></head><body><p>In hit television show "The X-Files" there is an episode titled "Monday". It's about a day that keeps happening over and over again, only differing in the small details of the day. In the end Mulder and Scully, (the stars of the show) end up dieing in a bank, due to a bomb explosion.<br /><br />The plot of "Source Code" is very similar to that of the "X-Files" episode "Monday". The story centers on Army helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal). The film begins with Stevens waking up on a train. He realizes, that he is in someone else's body. Within a few minutes, the train wakes up, where he regains conciseness in what is called a "Source Code". It is explained to him that the "Source Code" is a modern invention that allows one to experience the last eight minutes of a person's life. Stevens's objective is to find the bomb on the train.<br /><br />Overall, "Source Code" hooks you from the beginning and keeps your interest until the very end.</p></body></html>

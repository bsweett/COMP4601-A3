<meta name="summary" content="Terror at the Dance Academy"></head><body><p>American, Susie Banion, has just started at the prestigious Tam Dance Academy in Switzerland, but something isn't quite right. On the day she arrives, one of her fellow pupils is murdered, and in the weeks that follow a number of strange occurrences happen. Could it be that the dance academy is really run by a coven of witches? Why would a coven of witches even want to run a dance academy in the first place?<br /><br />Along with Dario Argento's previous film, "Deep Red", "Suspiria" is considered to one of Argento's masterpieces. I recently watched both films, one after the other, and in my opinion, although "Deep Red" has the better plot ("Suspiria" is barely coherent at times), visually, "Suspiria" is the better film. Dario Argento is renowned for making some of the most visually stunning horror movies of all time (this man can make a gory murder a thing of beauty) and in "Suspiria" he has some of the most visually stylish shots of his career and of any film that I have ever seen. "Suspiria" also has a chilling score, written by the Goblins, that perfectly sets the scene and is my favourite score of all time.<br /><br />"Suspiria" is the first film in Argento's "The Three Mothers" trilogy, the second film being "Inferno", and the third film being the recently released "Mother of Tears", which was made 30 years after "Suspiria".</p></body></html>

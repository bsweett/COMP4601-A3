<meta name="summary" content="Slickly and confidently made"></head><body><p>My experience of the American film version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307949486">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a> can't help but be influenced by the powerful experience of the earlier Swedish film. There is much to recommend each. There are choices in each film that I prefer over the other.<br /><br />David Fincher's American film is more slickly and confidently made but, perhaps because the story was familiar already, had less of an emotional impact that the rougher and rawer Swedish film. The American version of the investigation seemed too easy and, as good an actor as he is, Daniel Craig just carries too great an aura of physical competence to convincingly portray Mikael Blomkvist.<br /><br />Rooney Mara's Lisbeth Salander is distinct from but just as good as Noomi Rapace's. We experience less of Lisbeth Salander's world in the American film, mostly to the detriment of my investment in her story, but Fincher and Co. do leave out some information which was shoehorned into the Swedish film from later books in the series which was probably better left for later. Good call on that.<br /><br />And the American film has Stellan Skarsg?rd; always a good thing. Still, I think my preference falls to the Swedish <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TTWJJO">The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</a>. Or better yet, I can just mash them up in my imagination and have the best of both.</p></body></html>

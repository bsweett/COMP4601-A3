But I watched it again last night since the remake is coming out soon, so...<p>Dawn of the Dead begins an unspecified time after the closing of Night of the Living Dead. The zombies have reached at least as far east as Philadelphia, where two workers at a TV station decide to steal the weather chopper and head for Canada. They're taking a friend along with them, who brings another guy. The four of them are the core of the movie, aborting the Canada idea when they run out of fuel, stopping on the outskirts of Pittsburgh to take up residence in a shopping mall.<p>There are simply not enough good things to be said about this movie. While it didn't completely redefine the genre the way Night of the Living Dead did, Romero pushed the American envelope (as he is so fond of doing), incorporating giallo-style violence that Americans were completely unfamiliar with at the time while all the while pursuing the same sociopolitical commentary that makes Night of the Living Dead so rewatchable even thirty-five years later. Romero is a master at getting his point across without being too preachy about it; ninety-nine percent of the movie's hundred twenty-eight minutes (in the American version) keeps the commentary below the radar (all save one brief scene that's a little on the heavy-handed side).<p>For an ultra-low-budget flick, the acting is tremendous. All four main characters do their jobs capably, and they're surrounded with a supporting cast whose lack of acting resumes since is criminal. Special note should be given to Richard France, a member of the Romero "inner circle" since There's Always Vanilla, as an overly pragmatic television commentator who's just a joy to watch every time he comes onscreen.<p>The pacing is excellent, the effects not completely overdone (though, honestly, they did get better in Day of the Dead), the mix of humor and disgust perfect. There is very little to be said wrong about this brilliant movie. Don't expect to be scared, but expect to enjoy yourself tremendously. **** ?</p></body></html>

Following up the original movie, this sequel fitted perfectly and followed the original movie very well. I found Kate Beckinsale both believable and quite alluring in her role. While she doesn't fit the "action female" persona, Beckinsale does a creditable job. This movie goes into the history of the struggles between the vampires and the werewolves. Its tell a good story and within the frame of the this tale, the movie work pretty well.<br /><br />The movie got slammed dunk by many critics who may take themselves too seriously. Many movies of this genre suffered from professional critics who often write like snobs instead of looking into the such movie and taking it for what it is. Of course, it probably don't help that many critics really don't like this genre despite of their public statements.<br /><br />Overall, if you enjoyed the original movie, you will definitely enjoy Evolution. Its well acted, well supported and script reads very well to support the frame work of the story. Like many other reviewers, I would say forgo the critics on this one and listen to those who enjoyed this sort of film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Promising premise but doesn't deliver"></head><body><p>Good idea---aging Don Juan, now named Don Johnston, who is watching a film about the real Don Juan sits, in his sleazy running suit, eyes fixed on the tube, while his very pretty girlfriend walks out.  He manages to rouse himself from the couch long enough to utter a few weak words of protest but Sherry hits the road.  Good for her!<br /><br />I liked Bill Murray in Lost in Translation---the script was clever enough to support his aged, cynical, middle-aged man character.  Here that character is exploited and magnified, and we are treated to many, many. long minutes of this dreadful, basset-hound-like countenance, behind the wheel, on a plane, in an airport, on a couch.  He shows no emotion, only an occasional flash of testosterone as he views a thigh here and there.  That's what passes for love, in the heart of this soul-less man, and no wonder all the ladies left him.<br /><br />In order to sustain a viewer through two hours of film, the central character should be someone we care about.  I didn't see anything in this man, other than a knee-jerk response to his wonderful neighbor's family, to even remind me that he was alive.<br />I guess his humor was supposed to be drole and dead-pan, but it was very light on the drole and way too heavy on the dead-pan.<br /><br />On the plus side, we got to see some wonderful, aging women actors perform---Sharon Stone was gorgeous as the desperate, lusty trailer park ex; Jessica Lange was terrifically scary-intense as the "animal interpreter" and Tilda Swinton was good, too, as the biker-chick.  Jeffrey Wright, as the Ethiopian neighbor, Winston, brings some much needed humanity into the picture---very much Don's "dark-side."<br /><br />Yeah, it's fashionable to resist the temptation to give "Hollywood Happy Endings" in the Indie-World...But here Jarmuscsh has carried out the lack of any sort of conclusion to the ultimate point of not-caring.  The idea of sending this guy on the trail of his past is brilliant.  The fact is, when he bothered to meet these women, he didn't say anything that could have helped him to understand why these relationships never worked.  Where did he go wrong?  What could he learned now that would help him to resolve his Don Juan complex and learn to truly love?  When the ex's ask him why he's there, he just gives lame responses like "I was in the neighborhood."  The thing is, it's Winston, with his healthy life urge, who has propelled this guy onto the road, to solve the mystery.  The mystery is ostensibly to find the actual mother of the son, but we know that the real mission is for the aging lothario to find himself.<br /><br />The fact that this film maker has set up such a promising plot and then dropped it makes me angry. It could have been a film of substance, in which a real human being learns something but Jarmusch dropped the ball and contented himself with a stylistic trick.<br /><br />I also object to the condescending treatment the four ex-girlfriends are given.  Each one is shown in the most negative light. As another reviewer wrote, I was glad when the biker guy punched our hero in the nose---he deserved it.<br /><br />The obvious elephant-in-the-middle-of-the-room issue, which I will dare to mention, is---what did these four attractive women ever see in this guy in the first place?  I think this is a guy's movie, made by a guy, with a guy's fantasy point of view.  The fact that this really ugly guy with zero personality once had all these beautiful women, some of whom look like they still want him, is sheer wish-fullfillment on the part of the director in my humble female opinion.<br /><br />I was going to give this three stars, but now that I think about it, I'm reducing it to two.  The two stars are not for the writer-director, nor for Bill Murray, but for the wonderful women actors who showed up for this endeavor and for the promise of what this film could have been.</p></body></html>

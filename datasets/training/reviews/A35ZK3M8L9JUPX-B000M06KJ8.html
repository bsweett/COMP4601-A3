<meta name="summary" content="Marie Antoinette"></head><body><p>This movie tells the life of Marie Antoinette after her betrothal to Louis XVI. From shoes to scandals, this movie outlines Marie Antoinette's nature, and her dedication to a life of fabulousness and outrageousness. We hear her utter those immortal words that caused such an outrage amongst the peasants of France, but we soon learn that it was a lie, as was much of her life. The visuals and auditory elements, which evoke a powerful image of 18th-century Versailles, are the movie's forte. The end of the movie is a bit abrupt, the last image shows the royal family heading to Paris to be imprisoned in the building of the Conciergerie. There is no mention of the guillotine anywhere, which again can seem surprising, but which shows that Coppola deliberately tried to eschew stereotypes and do something different. I was wonderfully surprised by this unusual movie.</p></body></html>

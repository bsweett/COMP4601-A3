<meta name="summary" content="Ridley Scott Digs Deeper"></head><body><p>The controversy and criticism of "Prometheus" pretty much centers on two things: 1. Movie fans expected a straight-up "Alien" prequel, complete with queens, face-huggers, and worker aliens, and 2. The film does not have a neatly laid out, simplistic plot like the usual fare we see nowadays. Director Ridley Scott decided to go his own way, not taking the easy and simple route. The result is a masterpiece of mystery and questions. Lost by the critics is Scott's examination of human nature and the desire for absolute power and immortality contained within the search for our origins.<br /><br />Prometheus asks big questions about the creation of life on Earth, as well as what might be out there in deep space beyond our present technological capabilities. Human civilization has existed for a mere few thousand years, but the universe is billions of years old. The foolish belief by many of us today that we somehow have it all figured out is exemplified in the film by the monumental hubris of Peter Weyland, who selfishly set up the expedition to somehow cheat death-and to profit by whatever else it found.<br /><br />The fact that the Engineers in Prometheus were able to create magnificent technologies on such a vast scale only amplifies the mysteries of what we don't know. The universe is vast beyond our comprehension, and the world Ridley Scott creates in this film, with it's monsters, spacecraft, and buildings reinforce his plot device. The ending of the film, with the robot David and Dr. Shaw leaving LV-223 in the Engineer spacecraft, tells us in no uncertain terms that there remains a great deal still to be discovered.<br /><br />Think about it! Humanity has only begun to scratch the surface of space travel; we've only landed a few men on the moon, and the sum total of our exploration beyond that is limited to our own solar system-which constitutes a tiny portion of the Milky Way galaxy. We humans are like a speck of sand on the shores of a vast ocean-but one must remember it was only a few centuries ago that we thought Earth was the center of the universe!<br /><br />It takes a bit more than Transformers or the Avengers (which is a good movie for its intended audience) to touch on the kind of questions Scott is tackling here. He assumes his audience will consider the questions his film is asking. Many critics condemned "2001" and the original "Alien" for the very same things people are saying now; they weren't easy to understand, they didn't fit into established categories, etc.<br /><br />"Prometheus" thus fits into something the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates said 2400 years ago: "I know nothing except the fact of my own ignorance." Scott asked us to open our minds, and see beyond the usual formula stuff. It seems some lack the imagination to follow where he leads. That's okay. I'm quite willing to go on the journey.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mr. Chocolate is a Carnivore"></head><body><p>I liked this movie but I have to agree with all the reviews (who rate it both good and bad) that say Timothy Treadwell is emotionally and mentally ill.  It's true: the most amazing thing about his story was that he wasn't killed and eaten any sooner.<br /><br />I sympathize with the family and friends for their loss, but I can't gloss over what a crazy, grandstanding and ultimately suicidal "mission" this was.  He wasn't exactly Diane Fossey, who literally fought poachers off the mountain gorillas in Rwanda--these bears were in a state park.<br /><br />Absolutely NOTHING in science or life tells Treadway or anyone else that it's safe to live with bears.  He ventures into the wild and lives in a constant state of delusion, even as the bears kill and eat each other, his cute little foxes, the adorable little cubs.  As Herzog points out, there's nothing to support Treadway's fantasy world of harmony in the bloody Alaskan wilderness.<br /><br />GRIZZLY MAN is a fascinating story but I have to agree with the reviews which compare the interviews with BEST IN SHOW or A MIGHTY WIND.<br /><br />(If you were fascinated by this story, check out the book INTO THE WILD, about another young man who disappeared and died in the Alaskan bush in an attempt to live off the land.  GORILLAS IN THE MIST is both a book and a movie about Diane Fossey, another controversial person who fought on behalf of endangered animals).</p></body></html>

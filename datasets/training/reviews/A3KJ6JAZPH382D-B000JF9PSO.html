<meta name="summary" content="The ultimate horror movie"></head><body><p>Watching Paul Greengrass' "UNITED 93" is an exercise in anxiety. We all know that the ending is not going to be pretty, and that, as much as our dream would have been for the passenger heroics to have stopped the hijackers and saved the plane; instead there is a big section of torn up field in Western Pennsylvania where the plane ultimately stopped.<br /><br />The question is, then, is the film created with respect and dignity, or is it just another big budget lump? The answer splits at about 90% in favor of good.<br /><br />By using unknown actors and people who actually were real-life participants as Sept 11 unfolded, Greengrass avoids the ticky-tacky sentiment and - in a gutwrenching way - forces these men and women to relive that horrible morning all over again. The actors cast were not picked for their dramatic skills as much as their everyday looks and behavior. They spend much of their early screen time making idle chat or calling work on their cell phones, unaware of their impending fates. The timeline cuts back and forth between the Air Traffic and FAA teams, the military and the plane itself.<br /><br />The story is told in real time, filmed on handheld cameras that force a lack of opinion into "United 93" (as opposed to the made for TV <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EYJHDS">Flight 93: The Movie</a>). Greengrass captures the confusion and panic, especially the utter horror of the Newark Airport employees as they see the second plane hit the towers. In that regard, "United 93" is unlike just about anything you'll ever see.<br /><br />That remaining 10%, you ask? "Untied 93" can't help but indulge in populist myth-making. Greengrass made a valiant effort to get the approval of the passenger/crews family members before embarking on this movie's production. In the bonus documentary, some of the actors meet the families of the deceased, sometimes being more emotional than I'd wager the actors were prepared for. But my guess is, because of that need for confirmation and approval from these folks, almost every person on the flight plays an active role in taking on the terrorists. (With the exception of the one semi-foreign sounding man...which I found pointless.) But we don't know what happened. We can't know what was said. Did one of the passengers really say "I'll break his wrists"? Did the hostesses really join the charge? Or was this just Greengrass' empathy getting the better of him? And despite the fact that those herky-jerky hand-carried camera shots added to the tension and claustrophobia of the scenes inside the plane, there were moments when my inner-critic started grousing "buy this man a dman steadi-cam, already."<br /><br />That said, "United 93" is an affecting piece of film-making. It offers proof that not every major-studio offering gives into the lowest common denominator, and offers us, as citizen viewers, an opportunity to better comprehend the events that will forever mark our generation. Along with the documentary <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006B1HI">9/11 - The Filmmakers' Commemorative Edition</a>, "United 93" is the best of the movies that attempt to make understanding of that day.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Weird ending."></head><body><p>The Upside of Anger starring Joan Allen and Kevin Costner seemed like an interesting and funny film but this is one of the strangest films of 2005. The ending is completely ridiculous and comes from nowhere, Allen's character is so unlikable, I can't believe how narrissitic she comes off. Keri Russell and Evan Rachel Wood are the only two characters that have some depth and Costner isn't too bad as others have stated. This film starts off promising but ends up drowning in its own stupidity. Stay away from this absurd turkey.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="On September 24th everything you've experienced, everything you've known, never happened."></head><body><p>I bought this DVD because it was in a special deal, and I wanted the two other films - I've since had to sell one of them on, so I dunno what I was expecting from this!<br /><br />Forgotten is a very strange movie, seemingly about the death of a child, but actually about something completely different. I have to give due to Julianne Moore on making this film actually work - with a different actress, it could have died a death. (Nicole Kidman was originally rumoured to have the lead role, do we really think that would have worked? A bit too Others-ish I think.)<br /><br />The film is based around a very elaborate mind game, which does get a bit confusing after a while, but on a second viewing, you could probably see things starting to happen, which will make more sense as the film carries on. Telly (Julianne) being able to taste coffee, and wanting to know where hers was, despite not having coffee that morning, thinking that she did have a pen in her bag, when she didn't, and thinking her car was parked in one place, when it was parked in another. There's an awful lot that could have come straight out of an X-Files episode, and sometimes it does feel like it should have stayed as an episode, rather than being stretched to a full length movie.<br /><br />There are some fantastic scare moments in this, including people getting snatched off the ground and a car crash scene that works so well, I actually screamed. Thank God I wasn't holding my drink at the time, I believe I would have soaked myself. I got another shock at the end, as Linus Roache, who appears with very little dialogue, actually gave me the fright of my life, as he looked an older version of someone I know. It actually gave me shivers up my spine. (Interesting little fact, all the characters remain in black, apart from their memories, up until the end.)<br /><br />There's a little bit of a romantic subplot thrown in there, which works, but doesn't in a way. It feels wrong to be thrown into this movie, while Telly is desperately trying to figure out what's going on in her life.<br /><br />The film seems to end, and doesn't really end up explaining itself in any way whatsoever. You're left confused, wondering what on earth happened, and especially what happened to the people who were snatched off the ground! Where did they go?<br /><br />If you want a scare, and a curiousity-rousing movie, then go for this. Otherwise leave it well alone, cos you'll end up more puzzled than you did at the start.</p></body></html>

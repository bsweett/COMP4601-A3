After watching this movie, I have a clear answer.  This movie is about a nuclear weapon that is found in the desert then sold to an arms dealer.  CIA agent Jack Ryan has been given the task to find out all the details he can about this bomb.  However, no one wants to believe him because of a previous "goof up".  This movie is completely possible and I think that is why it makes it somewhat scary.</p></body></html>

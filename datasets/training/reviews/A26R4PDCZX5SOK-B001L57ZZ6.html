<meta name="summary" content="It just keeps coming at you ... very intense"></head><body><p>A very strong action/adventure movie with a huge suspense element. This movie starts fast and keeps going. Its a movie where you have no real idea of whats going on until the end. It just keeps building and building. And why the heck are these two key characters forced to work together? Watch and find out. This is really a good and exciting movie and one I will want to watch again and again.</p></body></html>

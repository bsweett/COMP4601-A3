<meta name="summary" content="Can You Cheat Death Twice??"></head><body><p>Having enjoyed the first Final Destination film, I bought this one. I find this one is better than the first. This time, we see 8 strangers who barely escape a horrible vehicle accident due to a girl's preminition. Putting a rift in death's design, like in part one, these people now have something in common.... trying to figure out how to cheat death again. With cool death scenes and good gory, bloody effects, along with good special effects, Final Destination 2 is worth watching. Not boring, not silly but entertaining. I'd recommend seeing this film. I don't think you will be disappointed.</p></body></html>

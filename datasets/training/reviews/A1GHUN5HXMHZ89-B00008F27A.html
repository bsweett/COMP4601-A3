Nothing comes close in my book of horror comedies. I love all their other work, but this stands the test of time well and will crack most people up whatever their age. This movie is quoted regularly at gatherings of people partying, and it makes a great party movie. AOD is a superb mix of horror movie and comedy. The first two Evil Dead movies although entertaining are mainly horror with less comedy. Many fans adore them although the third in the series was much more to my liking.<br /><br />An S-Mart employee has barely escaped a horrible experience in the woods where his friends were killed and he lost his hand. He has replaced it with a chainsaw attachment and he has a double barreled shotgun as well. Driving his 1973 Oldsmobile as fast as he can he is teleported while trying to escape. He ends up in medieval times and must prove himself to the local Lord by recovering a book of the dead. What ensues is comic genius as he fights skeletons, demons, witches, and himself. Excellent DVD with some extras. If you enjoyed this catch "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" and "Hotshots! Part Deux".<br /><br />P.S. I recently bought the HD DVD and it would not play on a DVD player that plays all formats, a region free DVD player, or my PC (locked up DVD player bad and it did not have eject button so that I had to disconnect cables in order to use the PC). I suggest you stay away fron it.<br /><br />CA Luster</p></body></html>

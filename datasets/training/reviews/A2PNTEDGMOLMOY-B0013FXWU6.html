<meta name="summary" content="A monster strides across the American frontier, wearing the skin of the oilman"></head><body><p>Paul Thomas Anderson ("Boogie Nights") has created a grim, powerful masterpiece of a film with "There Will Be Blood."  I'm not sure when I'll want to watch it again - it may be years - but eventually I will dive back in to this stark portrayal of one man's drive for the American Dream.<br /><br />Daniel Day Lewis plays Daniel Plainview and gives one of his trademark pitch-perfect, scary performances.  Plainview is essentially an ogre, desperate to sate his own appetites and more than willing to crush any mere human who crosses his path.<br /><br />Indeed, we first see Plainview hacking out a living in a silver mine, living in solitary desolation almost like a fabled monster in a cave.  Plainview's the kind of guy who considers a shattered leg worthy of a grunt or two, but not a real impediment to success - we see this in some brutal early scenes.<br /><br />But eventually Plainview becomes an oilman, willing to risk it all to find Wealth in the ground.  And why?  So he can get enough money so he can avoid human contact of any kind, a la Howard Hughes.<br /><br />This is a strange, powerful film.  A harsh soundtrack, a bleak landscape, and a cast filled with strong men playing for keeps in an unforgiving world combine to make this a chilling, riveting masterpiece. "I drink your milkshake!" is destined to go down as one of the great catch-phrases of cinema, perhaps the ultimate bit of trash-talk.<br /><br />Look for powerful performances throughout the film, although to be fair women don't get much chance to shine here.  Lewis is stellar, as always, but Paul Dano ("Little Miss Sunshine") really surprises as the twin boys Paul and Eli Sunday - the latter gets one of the most bizarre and horrifying story arcs in recent memory.  I'm not sure how many times these two actors shot the controversial final scene, but I hope for their sakes they filmed the rehearsal.<br /><br />A great, powerful, jarring film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A provocative (though imperfect) culture-clash movie"></head><body><p>James L. Brooks' SPANGLISH is a movie about the clash of cultures and lifestyles. In the middle of the movie, Flor (Paz Vega), a Mexican immigrant who works as a maid for the affluent Clasky family in California, sees her young daughter, Cristina, enjoying the rich lifestyle, and starts to feel disturbed by it, fearing that perhaps her daughter is starting to forget all the old cultural traditions as she is seduced by wealth. There is one scene in this section of the film that, in its own way, sums up its subtle cultural conflict: an argument that develops between Flor and John Clasky (Adam Sandler, who gives another fine dramatic performance here), in which Flor accuses Mr. Clasky of flaunting wealth and being "smug," and Mr. Clasky fires back at her, calling her a "hypocrite." Why deny your daughter this life if she wants it?, he seems to be saying.<br /><br />It is this kind of thematic questioning and ambivalence that gives SPANGLISH its real interest and unassuming power; it's why I think the movie is worth seeing, even though it isn't perfect. The character of Deborah Clasky---a caricature of neurosis and well-meaning insensitivity---is a serious (and not all that funny) flaw to Brooks' conception, since, as hard as Tea Leoni tries to humanize the character, her over-the-top neurotic well-meaning villainy threatens to reduce the central cultural conflict between affluence and tradition to a one-sided affair (I mean, which Mexican maid would really want their kid to grow up to be a Deborah Clasky? When you see the film, you'll see what I mean). And the final scene, between Flor and a gravely-disappointed Cristina, is a little disturbing in its implication that mere cultural pride trumps even getting a good education if offered it.<br /><br />Still, I consider those flaws aberrations in what is essentially a searching film about whether becoming affluent does (or should) trump one's cultural roots. Because it provokes these kinds of interesting and thoughtful questions, SPANGLISH is a film worth seeing and reflecting. Recommended (with some reservations).</p></body></html>

I knew more about the assassination than the later trial in New Orleans.  Frankly, that whole episode seemed like a political side show.  However, I'm glad to have found out more about Garrison's investigation.  My own personal opinion of the assassination was that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.  The surge of conspiracy books and theories was overwhelming in the years after 1963.  I recall an earlier film that I believe was titled "Executive Action" which starred, among others, Robert Ryan and Burt Lancaster.  An impressive part of that film was the closing list of all the people directly or indirectly involved in the investigation who had died under unusual circumstances.  Frankly, it was the enormity of those who believed in a conspiracy that gave me the greatest assurance that there was none.  After all, how would you keep such an elaborate scheme such a secret over so many decades?  People eventually talk and the theory that those who knew were eliminated ignored the presumed fact that this would merely end up involving more and more people.<br /><br />As a practical person, I found myself caught in between my self-assurance and the suspenseful creation of the conspiracy in "JFK".  I decided, for the sake of art appreciation, to just let myself enjoy the movie...and I did.  My one objection to the movie was the depiction of Garrison's family life.  It slowed down the movie, distracted us from the suspense, and unnecessarily made a bigger hero out of Jim Garrison than the movie required.  If it were all true then what did his homelife matter?<br /><br />"JFK" excels because even non-believers can set reality aside and enjoy an excellent suspenseful drama.  The acting, directing, writing etc is all very well done.<br /><br />As a side light to "JFK", the next movie I watched was "The Paralax View".  I had no idea that I was watching essentially the same political assassination theme.  This one went out of its' way to be out on the fringe.  It's concept of assassination for assasination's sake made me realize that Oliver Stone knew that the greater the dose of reality, the more engrossing the suspense.  I got to thinking that too much of this sort of movie could be a bad thing.  As a public service, I offer the suggestion of watching "The Conversation" as an antidote.</p></body></html>

Sure 13 GOING ON 30 may be the distaff side of Tom Hanks' biggie, but on its own, it's an enjoyable, well done and involving comedy.  It's fun to watch; Jennifer Garner is marvelous as its heroine, and underrated Mark Ruffalo is just right as the cast off boyfriend who finds out the torch is still lit.  While using the magic dust as an incredible device, we still enjoy watching Garner as she has to adapt her 13 year old mind to the 30 year old she has become.  Garner demonstrates a keen understanding of this and does extremely well in being both the teenager and the grown up girl who got what she wished for, but at what expense?  the 80s soundtrack is great, and I had a good time watching the dancing to THRILLER.  I never liked the song that much but the way it is used in this movie, along with another classic LOVE IS A BATTLEFIELD, is brilliant.  Judy Greer is fine as the still vicious Tom Tom; Andy Serkis is a joy out of the Gollum make-up; and West Virginia native Samuel Ball (from my neighboring community of Inwood), plays the brainless but hunky Alex very well, including his ridiculously foolish strip act.<br /><br />13 GOING ON 30 is predictable and at times a little mawkish, but I found it delightfully entertaining and think it stands on its own in spite of its comparison to BIG.</p></body></html>

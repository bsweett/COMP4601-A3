Nicholas Meyer crafted an exciting tale that remains true to the spirit of "Star Trek", paying homage to C. S. Forrester's "Hornblower" saga as well as Gene Roddenberry's vision. This edition restores scenes that were cut from the theatrical release, adding additional depth to the characters of Kirk, Spock, and especially, Scotty. The film works not only as a great episode of "Star Trek", but also as a fine science fiction film and military thriller.<p>Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) realizes that he is getting old, after watching a group of cadets lose the "Kobayashi Maru" scenario which he unexpectedly passed as a Starfleet Academy cadet. He decides to take one last voyage on the USS Enterprise, now a training vessel commanded by Captain Spock (Leonard Nimoy), in the company of other old friends such as Dr. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley), Chief Engineer Montgomery "Scotty" Scott (James Doohan), Commander Sulu (George Takei) and Commander Uhura (Nichelle Nichols). Meanwhile the USS Reliant commanded by Captain Clark Terrell (Paul Winfield) - with Commander Pavel Chekhov (Walter Koenig) as Terrell's first officer - is on a top-secret classified mission, surveying the Ceti Alpha solar system, as a possible testing site for Starfleet's secret Genesis Device. Soon the two Starfleet officers are captured by a group of humans led by the enigmatic, manical Khan Noonian Singh (Ricardo Montalban). Khan abducts the Reliant, and proceeds to the secret Starfleet base Regula I, where Kirk's old flame (Bibi Besch) is supervising the construction of the Genesis Device, setting the stage for a classic, fateful confrontation with Admiral Kirk and the Enterprise crew.<p>This splendid film is a sequel to the classic "Star Trek" episode "Space Seed" which introduced Khan to "Star Trek" audiences as among the original series' most intelligent, most charismatic villains. In addition to excellent performances from Nimoy, Shatner and Montalban, it is noteworthy as the film debut of Kirstie Alley in the role of the Vulcan/Romulan lieutenant Saavik. James Horner also contributed the first of many excellent film scores to this movie, giving a vast, nautical grandeur befitting a cinematic "Hornblower in Space".</p></body></html>

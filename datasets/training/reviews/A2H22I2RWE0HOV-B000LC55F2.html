<meta name="summary" content="The Prestige Suspends Our Disbelief"></head><body><p>I think that the reason I found The Prestige so entertaining is the fact that 1)It had a good cast of actors. 2) It was directed by Christopher Nolan  and 3) It was just a good chance to go into a movie and fall into the story.  There are moments when the storyline is so seemless and dark and intriguing that I was instantly reminded of Nolan's Batman Begins.  The Prestige is a thriller.  It is sort of a mystery. And it's dark.  Nolan prowls the streets of darkness with authority.  Moving performances by Jackman and Bale.<br /><br />Two aspiring magicians are at odds to ruin each others lives both professionally and privately.  After the death of his wife in a botched water-chamber trick, Robert Angier makes it his mission to defame and destroy the man he holds responsible for his wife's untimely demise,  Alfred Borden!  Angier  is a master showman, full of charisma, spell-binding audiences with his charm.  Borden is a masterful illusionist, bringing the impossible alive on stage.  Each is seeking to become the greatest magician of all time, cullng their bitterness into obsession, seeking the secrets to each other's illusions.<br /><br />In a time when such great cinematic distractions like Pan's Labrynth and Apocalypto were taking my attention, The Prestige was a good contender for my time. Christopher Nolan does not disappoint.  Michael Caine.  Scarlett Johnsson.  David Bowie.  Great supporting cast.  The ending isn't as mind-blowing as I expected, but it was defintely cool.  Pure story, the way I like my movies.  Not a lot of things to pick on.  Jackman and Bale have emerged a fine actors.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Dig it!</p></body></html>

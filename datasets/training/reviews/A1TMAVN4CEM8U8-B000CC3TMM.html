The movie is full of high action car chases and stunts.  Set in the beautiful Miami, Florida area, so again if you don't enjoy high action movies, just sit back and enjoy the view.<br />Highly recommended for fans of Jason Stratham  , James Bond movies, and high action movies, especially car chases.<br /><br />Gunner  March, 2008</p></body></html>

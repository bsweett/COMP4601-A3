<meta name="summary" content="DiCaprio all grown up"></head><body><p>This movie was on my watch list for quite a while.  Just think of the cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Djimon Hounsou and beautiful Jennifer Connelly.  It is a story about diamonds collected in Sierra Leone - scenery of Africa we have not seen since "Out of Africa movie" with all the cruelty it comes with: children oldiers, killings, white mercenaries from Rhodesia, South Afrika and other former colonies.  It is a story of greed, fatherly love and love in all the wrong places.  It is political satire (one minor character says at one moment  "We are lucky they did not find oil here - imagine what mess we would be in?") and also morality tale to about conflict that comes with beauty of the diamonds.  This is multi-dimensional movie and it does deserve the praise that it got at the Academy awards.  It is also fantasic to see two characters played by Leonardo and Djimon bond althought they could not be more different from any point of view.  Although difficult to watch at some moments, it is definitely a gem of a movie I have seen lately.</p></body></html>

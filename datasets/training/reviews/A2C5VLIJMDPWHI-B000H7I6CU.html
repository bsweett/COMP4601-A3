<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good for an animated car movie"></head><body><p>This isn't the type of film I'd watch on a regular basis, but I was on a plane and this was the featured movie so I tuned in. It was cute. The movie is about a truck that's friends with a race car, but another set of cars are plotting against the race car over a battle about oil. This turns into a Secret Service car style plan between the two groups to decide who is better. There were some cute parts, and it was amusing enough to keep me entertained. It's not the type of film I'd run out and buy, but I do think it'd be fun for kids and adults alike.</p></body></html>

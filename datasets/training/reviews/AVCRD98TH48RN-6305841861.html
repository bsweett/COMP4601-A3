<meta name="summary" content="A Looney Tunes Horror Film."></head><body><p>Up until this past year's hilarious "Shaun of the Dead," this film, "Evil Dead II," really had no competition whatsoever for the funniest Horror film ever made.  It would be easy to rave about this Cult Classic filled with trick photography, stop-motion animation, over-the-top gore-soaked casualties, Bruce Campbell's charming chin, and one of the most underrated endings in film history, but I will point out why this particular DVD is exceptional instead.  What makes this DVD rock is that the sound has been digitally remastered into THX surround sound.  The sound-effects in this film are essential to magnify the humor and horror to its great heights.  The other reason to get this DVD is the commentary which includes writer-director Sam Raimi, star Bruce Campbell, co-writer Scott Spiegel, and special make-up effects artist Greg Nicotero.  I swear that listening to these guys self-deprecate and otherwise rip on themselves and the movie is as much fun as watching this film for the very first time.  No kidding.  I was rolling with laughter.  For the quintessential backstory on this film may I recommend Bruce Campbell's thoroughly enjoyable book, "If Chins Could Kill," which is loaded with reminiscences about his time before, during, and after making this landmark Horror film classic.  "Evil Dead II" is a necessary purchase for any Horror film afficionado.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

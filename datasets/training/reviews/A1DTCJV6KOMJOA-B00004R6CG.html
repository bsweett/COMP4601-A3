This film pushes you into a  a world of murder, lust, lies and a dream like state so real It's as if everything around you disappears and you're in a dream and not watching a flick at all. Stewart is Ferguson a cop who is afraid of heights after he watches his partner fall to his death while they chase a suspect, after this he retires and then is hired to watch over a friends sucidial wife (Novak) who he comforts after she throws herself into San Fransico bay! When the wife dies suddenly Stewart is left heartbroken and finds a new love who reminds him of th egirl he lost. The film pushes into overdrive but in a subdued and calm manner. Vertigo is pure cinema at it's most daunting and magical. Not for a second do you believe anything that is happening on the screen. If someone was to tell you this story over the phone you would probably laugh till you wet your pants-but have you ever had dreams where the same person vists you over and over again or a case of deja-vu, then this film isn't so funny anymore. Hitchcock takes these elements of illusion and throws them at us one after another for the entire film. Stewart is brilliant the drawl in his voice underlies his paranoia perfectly and Novak shines as an uneven object of desire. Novak gives the best performance of her carreer. Vertigo leaves you spun and weak after each viewing because to watch it, a little bit of you has to belive what is going on and you have to just let go and fall into the film's premise and if you are afraid to do so-well then you have the flick Vertigo my friend!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Decent for what it was"></head><body><p>Terminator 3 was an average film taken on its own. That is all it tries to be, and in that, it succeeds admirably. It is just another action film in an everlasting and ever-expanding pantheon of action films. The only saving grace is that it's a darned good action film. As a Terminator film, however, it falters quite miserably in carrying on the torch.<p>Just as the first sequel came years after the original, Terminator 3 comes about a dozen years after T2 (although it doesn't seem that long: it seems there's a new special edition DVD of that film every couple of months!). I guess I can't blame James Cameron for milking that cow as much as he can, nor can I blame him for refusing to helm this sequel. When you think about it, the minute that it was announced he wasn't going to make the movie, we should have known that it wouldn't be true to the first two: Terminator was Cameron's brainchild. Nevertheless, here it is.<p>The plot of the film is probably evident to anyone within several hundred meters of a television, radio, computer, bus stop, movie theater, etc. It is nearly a remake of Terminator 2 when you think about it: New machine comes back in time to kill future leader(s), old machine is sent back to save them. With such novelty it isn't a mystery as to how the plot seems to go nowhere amid incredible (and incredibly expensive) chase scenes. In all honesty, people who want a little introspection ought to look at the first two films, there isn't any here.<p>From a technical standpoint, the movie is a great success. With a budget in excess of $150 million, the film has sufficient resources for magnificent eye-candy. Car chases, explosions, robot effects, you name it, it is pulled off here with style and aplomb. The acting is also surprisingly decent. Arnold's last pre-political film has him back in the role that started him off. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are both good actors and help the film tremendously. Kristanna Loken is brilliant as the new 'Terminatrix,' showing no emotion at killing dozens of people.<p>The major problem with this film is this: Would it have been fitting for Saving Private Ryan to have been filmed as a straight-action film? Of course not. It had very important messages-just dumping them for the sake of killer battle sequences (no pun intended) would have been a waste. The same applies here. Although the Terminator series has always been a good action series (even the first: shoestring effects rock!), the action is the focus here instead of the ideas. The ideas not only take a back seat, they are pretty much swept under the rug. It has been said before, but I will say it again: the first two films were about making our own destiny, that the future is not set, as several characters have commented during the saga. However, here the message that the war of humanity against the machines is inevitable. This is about 180 degrees from the original philosophy. Instead of examining this or even trying to harmonize it with the original message (impossible, but they should have tried), they just plow along on the chase scenes. This movie has no real insight into present-day society, nor does it try to. Being as the action was in the first Terminator primarily to service to the story and now the converse is true, it is no wonder that Cameron opted out of his own creation.<p>In short, the movie was a Terminator film solely because the franchise is an entertainment juggernaut. The studio just wanted the name. They should have changed the names and actors in the film and just made it a non-franchised title. At the very least, it wouldn't have been referred to as a remake by me.</p></body></html>

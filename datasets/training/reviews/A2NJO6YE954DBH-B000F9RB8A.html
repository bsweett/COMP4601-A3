<meta name="summary" content="Stephen Chow comes up with a clever mix of karate and slapstick"></head><body><p>While I was watching and thoroughly enjoying Stephen Chow's film "Gong fu" ("Kung Fu Hustle"), I was also trying to think of the best cinematic reference point that would succinctly explain what is really going on beyond what we see on screen. That would be Pig Sty Alley, a slum in Shanghai that is run by a landlady (Qiu Yuenm who I defy any viewer to recognize from "The Man With the Golden Gun") who does absolutely everything with a cigarette dangling from her lips. There are gang wars going on all around them, but the Axe Gang, the biggest and baddest bunch around, ignore Pig Sty Alley because there is no money to be made there. This is just as well because if anybody causes trouble in that neighborhood it turns out that there are not one, or two, or even three, but four kung fun masters. This is discovered by Sing (Chow), a would-be gangster who figures he can impress the Axe Gang by what he does in Pig Sty Alley. But things go very poorly for him and his would be employers visit to clean up his mess. This precipitates a great deal of martial arts action.<br /><br />At the height of the action in this 2004 film it suddenly hit me that the movie it most reminded me of was "The Princess Bride." The key commonality between the two is the inherent sense of joy that infuses both films. This is not a spoof in the "Airplane!" tradition, but more of a humorous homage along the lines of "A Mighty Wind," where you have to get it right at the same time you are making your comic points. You might be able to reduce "Gong fu" down to a combination of karate and slapstick, but you have to grant that Chow has to get both parts right, which is why this works. The comedy is integrated as well as the wirework, which is why I found this film so utterly enjoyable. The goal is to have fun and it is well met here.<br /><br />The more you know the conventions of the genre the more you can appreciate how Chow's film plays with them, especially with the revenge of the supporting characters mentality that is at play. One of the reasons I thought "Spider-man 2" was the best comic book superhero movie made to date was because of the match up between Spider-man and Doctor Octopus allowed the fights to exist in three dimensions; fighting on the side of a building or a subway is not a problem for those two. I think "Gong fu" has a similar advantage and perhaps the simple idea that the action here is three-dimensional explains why the look of films like "The Matrix" and "Wo hu cang long" have become a cinematic rage in terms of special effects. Here we are in the early days of the 21st century and perhaps it is because of the advances in CGI that wirework comes across as still being quite impressive, even the two of them are mixed the way they are here.<br /><br />If anything, Chow's film is a Kung Fu fantasy. Reality starts to be displaced when wirework is involved, and here the judgment as to what action choreographers Sammo Hung Kam-Bo and Woo-ping Yuen can come up with that looks good on camera. If it looks good, then do it. Without conventional restraints Chow can make things bigger, culminating not only in the Lion's Roar through a speaker but the really big imprint of the hand of power. The paradigmatic scene for me in "Gong fu" is when all of the kung fu masters emerge to take on the two harpists, named Harpist No. 1 (Kang Xi Jia) and Harpist No. 2 (Hak On Fung), who pluck strings on their large instrument to send swords (and worst) hurtling towards our heroes. I would give credit to the kung fu masters, but part of the fun here is finding out who they are. This might not be a great film, but it is certainly great fun, so much so that the best thing I can say about it is that people who do not like kung fu movies should enjoy and be impressed by this one.</p></body></html>

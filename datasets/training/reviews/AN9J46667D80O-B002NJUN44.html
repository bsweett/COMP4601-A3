<meta name="summary" content="Oh, lord, what an awful movie"></head><body><p>This movie features one incredible character! He's unbelievably sexy, intelligent, quick-witted, fast on his feet, more than able to swing a sword or shoot an arrow. He's everything you would want in a movie hero!<br /><br />His name is Murtagh, and sadly he's basically just a low-level sidekick.<br /><br />The actual "hero" of this movie is named Eragon. He's a pathetic little creature. Arrogant, self-centered, obnoxious, annoying, oblivious and generally just awful.<br /><br />"Eragon" the movie is an almost perfect translation of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/044023848X">Eragon (Inheritance, Book 1)</a> the book. It very excellent captures the pointless characters, the ripped-off plot, the badly-done setting and clunky dialogue. To those things is adds mediocre acting, lousy directing and even worse dialogue.<br /><br />On agonybooth.com there's a write up of this movie. It points out certain things that seem obvious, but escaped the filmmaker's attention (like why is Eragon hunting in the middle of the night? Why does this "poor farm boy", live on what is, by mideval standards, a small estate? Why does he keep his bow strung and hung on a wall? Why does his cousin wear blue jeans? This, mind, is in the first ten minutes). The film also leaves one wondering why the Evil Bad Guy (tm), keeps his throne room so darkly lit. Surely there's tons of people who wanna stab him. Logically, shouldn't he keep his space bright and cheerful in order to keep from being snuck up on? (and no, I'm not sure of the grammar there, either)<br /><br />Given the source materiel, I don't know if it was possible at any point for this to be made into a decent movie. None of the actors are bad. Some of them are quite good, just horrible in their roles. I know it would've been helpful had the elven character had pointy ears and had the dwarf character not been the same height as everyone else.<br /><br />Basically, this is a movie that makes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXQM">Dungeons & Dragons (New Line Platinum Series)</a> look intelligent and complex. It's the kind of movie that gives fantasy films a bad name. Had this film been made before the Lord of the Rings movies, it would have merely been stupid. Now it's just insulting to fans of fantasy and movies in general.<br /><br />The final black mark against this movie? I HATED the book. Just check my review of it. I'd still rather read the book again than watch this movie. That's how bad it is.<br /><br />Avoid.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Problems from the Beginning"></head><body><p>We watched the movie last night and had problems from the beginning understanding the dialogue. The surround ambient noise level was high enough that it was difficult to impossible to hear what they were saying. Words are important in this movie and if they're that hard to understand then the movie is missing the mark. From what we could determine it seemed to have an interesting story and the acting we were able to hear and see seemed good.<br /><br />My system and its speakers are balanced to within 1/2 decibel so I can say the problem was not with my system; that means to me the audio mix was out of balance making it difficult to understand what was being said. It's hard to imagine something like that happening but our inability to hear the words suggested the problem was indeed a real one.<br /><br />In addition the movie seemed choppy, jumping around from scene to scene in a rather abrupt manner and making it difficult to follow the story. The combination of just those two elements made the movie simply not worth watching and we stopped watching it about half way through.<br /><br />I see many favorable reviews and truly wished we could have enjoyed it too. I suggest you rent this one before you buy and see how it plays out on your system first.</p></body></html>

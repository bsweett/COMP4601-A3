My interest was held throughout, yet when it was all over, I was extremely disappointed in how little my interest added up to.<br /><br />Directed by Clint Eastwood, HEREAFTER would appear to be exploring the old question "what happens to us after we die," but really it is a character study of a couple of folks who have very atypical experiences with death.  Ultimately, it isn't terribly meaningful because it is NOT universal.<br /><br />The film starts out with a bang.  We meet Marie (Cecile de France), a TV journalist on vacation in Thailand with her producer boyfriend.  She heads out of the hotel to do some last minute shopping, and in minutes, finds herself facing the tsunami that so famously devastated that region of the world some years ago.  Eastwood is not known for spending big bucks on special effects, but these scenes are fairly effective in their depiction of the awesome destructive force of the killer wave (when we see the wave gathering strength by sucking in all the water from the beach...that is pretty scary).  Marie drowns in the water, and feels herself headed towards a light where shadowy figures beckon to her.  She is brought back to our world, though...but she has been deeply changed by her experience.<br /><br />We then meet George (Matt Damon), a very shy man living along and working on a loading dock.  He seems unusually withdrawn from the world.  We discover early on that he is a psychic (apparently the real deal) with an ability to see beyond the grave and communicate with the dearly departed to send messages to their loved ones.  His ability is a compelling temptation for all who encounter him ("read me!!"), but the intimate knowledge he gathers from virtual strangers also alienates him from those folks.  His slimy brother (Jay Mohr) essentially tells him to capitalize on his abilities ("with great power comes great responsibility") but for George, he is cursed, not gifted.<br /><br />The third leg of the story is about young British twins Marcus & Jason (played by twins Frankie & George McLaren).  Jason, the stronger and more outgoing brother, is killed, and poor Marcus is sent to a foster home to stew not only about the separation from his drug-addicted mother but about his loss.  The 12-year-old is adrift...compelled to find some way to reach out to his brother again.<br /><br />All three of these characters carry a sadness with them.  Marcus is obviously saddled with grief, and Damon with loneliness...but it is Marie who is perhaps the most tormented.  She was on top of the world...a celebrity journalist who was also a model.  The world at her feet.  Yet her near-death experience leaves her feeling separate from everyone.  She wants to research her experiences and write about them. Everyone else just urges her to be quiet about it and take some time off from work.  As her career passes her by, she becomes more convinced that her experience was a revelation.<br /><br />It seems unlikely that these 3 characters would ever meet...but the plot has other contrivances in mind.  I didn't mind...I expected the ultimate meeting of these three to come and for something of import or relevance to happen.  I was left disappointed.<br /><br />But the film is interesting in large part because the three leads give outstanding performances that are well worth checking out.  McLaren does a nice job of showing the particular kind of grief a child feels.  DeFrance (previously only known to me from her fierce performance in HIGH TENSION) is a striking performer, and makes her character tough but damaged.  And Damon gives another nice performance, underplaying admirably (although occasionally coming across just a little like his character in GOOD WILL HUNTING).  Here is another actor who seems to give nuanced work under the direction of Eastwood.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me was the feeling that the entire Tsunami scene existed only to create some really cool previews, so that folks would be more likely to come to the movie.  There is no real reason that Marie needed to have her experience in that famous, true-life tragedy.  She could have drowned in a swimming pool in Milwaukee and had the same shattering, personal experience.  Certainly the scenes are dramatically staged...but they are utterly out of character with the rest of the movie.<br /><br />HEREAFTER promises much but delivers little, beyond some really nice performances.  For me, that is just enough to recommend it to audiences who understand they are about to see a quiet, slow-paced movie; not some kind of supernatural thriller as the previews hint at.  I just wished that all the hard work had added up to more.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not as good as the comic, but enjoyable nonetheless"></head><body><p>Much better than the last Mark Millar comic to film adaptation, namely Wanted, Kick-Ass is a gleefully ultraviolent blast.  Aaron Johnson stars as Dave, a teenage loser whose obsession with comic books leads him to donning a ridiculous costume, calling himself Kick-Ass, and fighting crime.  Things don't go so well for him naturally in the process as he winds up getting his you know what handed to him, and eventually comes across masked vigilantes Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) who are targeting gangster Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) whose own son (Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse) decides to don a costume and call himself Red Mist.  Directed by Layer Cake helmer Matthew Vaughn (who at one time was set to helm the third X-Men film, and is no preparing an X-Men prequel), Kick-Ass is filled with fun, ridiculous violence and action, but sadly manages to lose steam after its first half.  The cast is great (Cage in particular has great fun doing an Adam West impersonation) all around, but even they can't save the fact that by the time Kick-Ass wraps up, it's become the kind of comic film that it pokes fun at in the first place.  Not to mention the fact that so much of the little things that made the comic and its characters so interesting (namely the real "secret" origin of Big Daddy and Hit Girl in the comic) is nowhere to be found, as are most of the darkly comedic moments and are replaced by more or less happier turnouts.  Despite how much the film adaptation of Kick-Ass has been streamlined from the comic though, the film is still plenty fun and enjoyable, and the fact that it didn't undergo a complete overhaul like the film adaptation of Wanted is reason enough to praise it alone.</p></body></html>

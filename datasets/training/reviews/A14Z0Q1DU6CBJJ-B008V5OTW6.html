<meta name="summary" content="Too bad most of it is COMPLETE FICTION"></head><body><p>MUNICH is an excellent film with the quality production value and performance of any other Spielberg film.<br /><br />Yet, there is no excuse for the fact that Spielberg FICTIONALIZED a large portion of the film. Especially when the TRUE STORY is out there in so many other venues. Like the novels: Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team & Massacre in Munich: The Manhunt for the Killers Behind the 1972 Olympics Massacre.<br /><br />In my opinion, there is no excuse for someone with such power, influence and experience in filmmaking like Spielberg has, to make a film that DISTORTS HISTORY, intent and emotion like MUNICH does. Those who don't have the gumption to look further into the issue will assume that the MOVIE is TRUTH. They will be misinformed.<br /><br />The film IS EXCELLENT, as long as you look at it as FICTION.<br /><br />The events are violent and unapologetic. The brutal nature of the events that unfolded are captured tremendously. Eric Bana's performance is OSCAR WORTHY. The story does get draggy at points, but the overall movie is a solid and worthy piece.<br /><br />So, you come to the point where you have to decide STARS???  Do not be mistaken... this is a 4 or 5 star movie... but how many stars do you take away from a film and a Director that should have known better than to pass off FICTION as FACT. How incredibly ARROGANT and LAZY is it of Spielberg and UNIVERSAL to not have pursued more truth in their film. Included the REAL HITMEN's 2cents?<br /><br />Or is it that UNIVERSAL and SPIELBERG were more concerned about getting across another hollywood skewed message to the current administration about revenge and war making things worse, that they weren't concerned about truth?<br /><br />I THINK IT WAS THIS. With a little arrogance thrown in too. So... I give it a 2.</p></body></html>

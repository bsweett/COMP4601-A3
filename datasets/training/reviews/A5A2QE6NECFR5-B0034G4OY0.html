<meta name="summary" content="Big disappointment from this director, but still with good moments..."></head><body><p>I have liked almost every film Clint Eastwood has directed, but with this story, he made lots of choices that just did not work for me. First, a word about the successful parts: I sympathized with the main character played by Matt Damon, a reluctant psychic who would like to "retire" from the practice of giving readings but who keeps encountering people who need the hope that such contacts bring. I used to give readings myself. I was trained in my mid-20's in a small church of the American Spiritualist Association, in Albuquerque. I did mediumistic readings frequently for two years, never for money, and only part-time. Many people claimed that what came through me, but not supposedly from me, was helpful. However, I grew uneasy with the practice over time, and gave fewer and fewer until doing my final one in 1984, eleven years after first learning how. I met people who only wanted their pre-determined beliefs confirmed, and people who wanted "guidance" way too frequently, and people who "channel-shopped" until they got "spiritual permission" to do what they wished to do anyway. So Matt Damon's dilemma in this film resonated with me.<br /><br />Ah, but Mr. Eastwood, you mucked up this tale of moral conflict mightily. The first two-thirds of your movie is so terribly slow, and sad, and much of it is in French, and I almost gave up on your film. Not everyone in grief is so paralyzed that he or she talks in whispers without need, or makes every physical motion take twice as long as it should. There was no real cause to make one character French and spend so much time in the details of her news anchor job. No real cause, either, to make another character British, and spend so much time showing his mom's drug abuse. All these atmospherics and opportunities to show the skylines of Paris and London do not add enough to your story line to justify the time you took doing them. I found neither the French woman nor the English boy sympathetic enough to make me root for them overmuch. The last 40 minutes were pretty good, but a film with such a title and theme should have expended more screen time showing and explaining the hereafter and less on the unpleasant details of the earthly lives of your characters.</p></body></html>

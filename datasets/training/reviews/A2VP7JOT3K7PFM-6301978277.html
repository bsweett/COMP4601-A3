They thus quickly board a train to Florida, disguised as "Josephine" and "Geraldine" (later "Daphne"), the newest members of an all-girl jazz band.  Things really get hot when the band's ukulele player Sugar Kane (Monroe) falls for Cary Grant sounding "Shell Oil" Junior (Curtis again) and a relic playboy named Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown) falls for "Daphne."  Complicating these budding romances is "Spats" Colombo who also is in Florida looking, with his henchmen, to snuff out the only two witnesses of his gangland shooting.<br /><br />There is unforgettable and hilarious dialogue between Osgood and "Daphne" at the end of the movie.  As well, the most unforgettable line in this entire movie is the very last line and it's delivered by Osgood.  (After this last line is delivered, the screen fades to black with jazz music blaring.)<br /><br />All actors do a good job in their parts.  There is a fantastic chemistry between Tony Curtis (who plays Joe/ Josephine/ "Shell Oil" Junior) and Jack Lemmon (who plays Jerry/Geraldine/Daphne).  (Note that Tony Curtis' "Josephine" voice was dubbed by another actor as Curtis couldn't speak high enough.)  I have to give special kudos to Jack Lemmon who, in my opinion, does an outstanding job throughout this movie.  (He's the one who says the line that titles this review.)<br /><br />This movie has lots of energy from its opening credits to its end.  This is partly due to the acting but also partly due to the distinctive jazz music that can occasionally be heard in the background.<br /><br />There are ten songs in this movie, four performed by Marilyn Monroe.  (Note that this movie was released three years before Monroe's death.)<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2001) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has one disappointing extra of Billy Wilder movie trailers.  (I'm not judging the DVD on this since extras are optional not mandatory.)  Also, be aware that there are no English subtitles but there is closed captioning.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a hilarious classic comedy starring the legendary Marilyn Monroe!! I guarantee that if you see this movie, you won't get "the fuzzy end of the lollipop."<br /><br />(1959;  2 hr;  16 scenes;  black and white; wide screen)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THIS IS A GREAT FILM"></head><body><p>KISS KISS BANG BANG is one heck of a good movie.  Fresh.  Original.  Funny.  Suspenseful.  And well done all around.  Writer/director Shane Black who burst onto the scene with LETHAL WEAPON has created a film that pokes fun at the very genre which made him famous.  Its complex but sensible plot takes lots of twists and turns and holds your interest throughout.  There are some wonderfully creative scenes especially when Harry (our hero) decides to play Russian roulette with a bad guy orderly.  It's totally unexpected.  The casting is superb:  Robert Downey Jr. is marvelous as the reluctant hero who finds himself caught up in a complex web of deception, murder and everything else.  He's also given a very witty narrative that aids rather than hinders the action.  Val Kilmer is at his best as Gay Perry, the "gay" detective who is also a consultant on Downey's supposed film.  Kilmer's comic timing is wonderfully controlled.  Michelle Monaghan (MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 3) plays the love interest with a nice mix of seductive flirtation and hard boiled no-nonsense.  Corbin Bernsen, who has been in some really bad films in the past few years, redeems himself playing the nasty villain of the piece.  I really enjoyed this movie; it's so much fun and is one of the best I've seen this year.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p></body></html>

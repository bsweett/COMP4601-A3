<meta name="summary" content="Good movie about two men living on the DL"></head><body><p>Brokeback Mountain is now available on DVD.  Heath Ledger stars in the film as Ennis.  He comes from a difficult background and seemingly broken home.  He takes a job as a rancher and meets Jack.  Jack is a rancher working rodeo.  Their bosss (Randy Quaid) has them working on the top of Brokeback Mountain isolated from the rest of the world.  The two men bond like good friends.  One cold evening Jack invited Enniss into his tent so that he can keep warm.  They soon find themselves embroiled in passion. It's the sixties and homosexuality between Wyoming cowboys is taboo.  They hide their feelings and Ennis initially has a hard time dealing with the situation, even declaring it a "one time thing," even though their trysts continue.  Ennis and Jack soon split up due to a change in their assignments. Ennis goes on to get married and becomes a father.  Jack still has a strong attraction to men but he eventually settles down with a woman.  When the two re-connect after time has passed they continue their hidden love.  Brokeback Mountain is a good movie, a little overhyped, a little soft porn, but a great story about two men living on "The DL."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dazzling to look at...but boring."></head><body><p>There's a lot to like in this film.  Technically it is a marvel.  As I watched it, every so often I was simply struck anew by how much work went into it.  Each movement carefully executed by hand, so that the little "stick figures" spring to life.  The attention and craftsmanship is staggering...not a word I use very often.<br /><br />There are many lovely, artistic images as well.  My favorite was a scene near the end when the Corpse Bride stands in a doorway, and her long gown slowly turns into a cloud of butterflies.  It was a delicate and lovely moment...showing a true flight of imaginative fancy.<br /><br />But there are too many things not to like.  The story is pedestrian.  None of the characters are very engaging.  And even at around 80 minutes, the film was too long.  The plot is too slight, and it is padded by some mediocre (and poorly sound-edited) Danny Elfman tunes.  Elfman is trying yet again to evoke the Teutonic bombast of  Kurt Weill (Threepenny Opera, "Mack the Knife") but his music sounds the same from movie to movie.  I like that Tim Burton has his group of collaborators (like Johnny Depp or Helena Bonham Carter), but it's time to dump Elfman.  His best stuff is still Oingo Boingo and the theme to The Simpsons.  After Batman, I think he stopped actually writing anything original.<br /><br />I see at least 100 movies per year in the theaters, and another 100 or so on DVD / television.  About once every two years or so, a movie literally makes me doze off.  THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES did that to me.  And now, shockingly, THE CORPSE BRIDE has done it.  I lost about 5 minutes due to a little nap I took.<br /><br />My problem with many Burton movies is that they lack a heart.  Not that he doesn't want the movies to have heart, but somehow he seems to direct away from honest emotion.  Either the story is too boring to generate interest (as here) [and yes, I know he didn't technically direct this film, but let's face it...the product is his], or the plot becomes too muddled with messages to drive home an emotional climax (BIG FISH) or the film is simply too sloppy for any real emotional impact (BATMAN RETURNS).  His best movies generate real feeling from the audience DESPITE Burton, usually because his performers give him the heart he can't seem to find...he's too busy dazzling us with his visual virtuosity to simply stay put and let us OBSERVE humans in action.  EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, PEE WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE and even WILLY WONKA makes us care because their lead performers are either subtle enough (Johnny Depp, Freddie Highmore) or childlike enough (Johnny Depp, Paul Reubens) to draw a response from the audience.  Other movies, like ED WOOD, are a treat because Burton obviously has an affection for the odd and strange in people, and ED WOOD is truly populated by the odd and strange.  But again, to me CORPSE BRIDE left me quite cold (no pun intended).<br /><br />Based on the reaction of the kids who were in the audience with me, this movie doesn't have enough slapstick and mischief to engage the little ones.  It doesn't have emotional impact enough to engage adults.  And teens, who love Johnny Depp, soon realize that his voice alone does not a Johnny Depp film make!<br /><br />Because of the lovely artisanship, I can't totally condemn the film.  And it does have a terrific voice cast.  But I cannot recommend it either.  A big disappointment.</p></body></html>

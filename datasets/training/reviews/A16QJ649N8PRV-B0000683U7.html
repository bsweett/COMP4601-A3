<meta name="summary" content="A Cinema Classic"></head><body><p>This Alfred Hitchcock film is a definite classic.<br /><br />It features Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) as a victim of mistaken identity.  He is thought to be a spy and has several 'bad guys' trying to kill him.  When Thornhill starts his day, he is just a regular businessman.  Before long, his world is turned upside down.<br /><br />Eva Marie Saint plays Eve Kendall who is Thornhill's love interest.  She also wears some other hats in this movie.  I will forego mentioning more about her to avoid any spoilers.<br /><br />The action ranges from the United Nations building in Manhattan to the top of Mt. Rushmore as well as several others in between.<br /><br />There are several twists and turns throughout.  This is a very good show that is well worth watching.</p></body></html>

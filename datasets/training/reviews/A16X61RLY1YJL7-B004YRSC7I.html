<meta name="summary" content="Memento - Intriguing and original!"></head><body><p>&quot;Memento&quot; can obviously be described in many ways.  I see it pretty much as a mind boggling and extremely original movie that is extraordinarily inventive in how it's told.  From the very beginning or should I say the very end of this film to the end or was it the beginning, this film will lead you in the process of here's how it ended and now let's work out how we got there.  I simply cannot think of any other film that I've seen that has been portrayed in such a manner and oddly enough, it works wonderfully for this thriller.<p>Simply put, to make this movie work, it had to take some of Hollywood's best on screen talents and that is exactly what the producers of this film came up with.  Guy Pearce's performance as a man who cannot make new memories is stunning to say the least.  The ever beautiful Carrie-Anne Moss of &quot;Matrix&quot; fame performs brilliantly, showing that she definitely has talents outside of the &quot;Matrix.&quot;  Joe Pantoliano, most recently acclaimed for his performance during his stint on &quot;The Sopranos,&quot; performs exceptionally well in this film, just showing that he gets better and better with every role.<p>The movie was based on an original short story by Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan took it and ran with it, culminating in this extremely intriguing revenge thriller.  Christopher Nolan most certainly deserves all the praise and accolades he has and continues to receive for the originality of concept in the screenplay and his directing performance of this film.<p>The Premise:<p>Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a rather odd individual who at one point seemingly had the perfect life with his wife yet one day that came crashing down on him when he awoke and found men attempting to rape and kill his wife.  During that incident he struck his head on the wall and has, since that time, not been able to make any new memories.  What follows from there is an intriguing tale in which Leonard, who is constantly taking Polaroid snapshots, making notes and doing self tattoo's to remind him of the &quot;facts,&quot; attempts to seek revenge upon the person responsible for his wife's death...<p>I would definitely recommend this mind boggling, well told revenge thriller for any and all who are interested in this type of film, Guy Pearce's performance alone makes this film one to watch!  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>-IFC Interview with Writer/Director Christopher Nolan<br />-Theatrical Trailer and TV Spot<br />-&quot;Following&quot; Trailer<br />-Tattoo Gallery<br />-Director &amp; Cast Biographies</p></body></html>

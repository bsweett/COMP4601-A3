<meta name="summary" content="Second Sequel Establishes the Iconic Status of Jason Voorhees"></head><body><p>It's hard to rate a film now that likely depended heavily on its effect in the theater.  Friday the 13th part 3 was released in the theater in 3-D.  3-D saw a popular revival in the early 1980s, so Steve Miner and Paramount Pictures wanted to follow-up his successful sequel to the original slasher film about Jason and his mom with a new sequel that could cash in even more.  It worked and Friday the 13th part 3 was a huge box-office success.  It grossed $36 million with a budget of $2.5 million.  Not too shabby.<br /><br />The same formula is here that exists in all of these films.  Part 3 takes place right after part 2.  Jason survives, grows a few inches and gains a few pounds and goes to a store where he changes into something more menacing than overalls.  He of course kills anything that might be alive along the way.  Jason waits in a barn unmasked and begins killing those who enter.  He eventually wanders out and obtains his iconic goalie mask.  Like any Friday the 13th film, it has gratuitous content but it is even more evident due to the fact that it is supposed to be in 3-D.  There are clearly some things that are intentionally meant to pop out at you but don't because the 3-D version is not available on DVD.  This insane girl Chris at the lakeside resort where Jason is killing all these people eventually chops Jason in the head and kills him.  In imitation of the first movie's big scare, she ends up in a canoe in the middle of the lake and Jason's mother's reassembled head and body leaps from the lake and drags her into the murky green deep.  It worked the first time in the first film, although that was even somewhat derivative.  It worked less so the second time in part 2 when Jason jumped through the window.  At this point, it isn't really that scary and how the hell did Pamela Voorhees sew her head back onto her body anyway?<br /><br />In Friday the 13th lore, there are rumors of an alternate ending which I think would've been far more appropriate and entertaining.  Instead of Chris dreaming Jason's mother jumps out of the lake, she dreams of Jason chopping off her head.  Part 3 really establishes the marketing drive behind these movies and Paramount took it and ran with it. It also established a Jason that was more worthy of audience cheers than screams.  Steve Miner had enough of this series and would not return for part 4.  I can see why, the series took a significant dive here and it would soon get worse.</p></body></html>

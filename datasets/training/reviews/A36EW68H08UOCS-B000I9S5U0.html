That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet." The reason I bring this up is Ron Howard's "Cinderella Man" made me think over and over of another boxing film of 30 years ago.  In that film there was also a struggling boxer who had been knocked around by life and the ring before almost miraculously being guided towards a chance at the Heavyweight Championship.  Both films feature a shy, softspoken woman character - although in the other film the woman is not yet his wife.  Both films feature a terrifying, loud-mouthed reigning champion who our underdog hero meets in the film's final act in a knock-down drag-out 15 round bout that ends, not with a knockout, but with a decision.  Both films feature charismatic managers who believe in their fighters and make sacrifices to give them a chance - although Paul Giamatti's performance is certainly different from Burgess Meredith's. Both of our boxing underdog heroes even buy pet turtles.  Was there anyone else who didn't see a fair amount of "Rocky" in "Cinderella Man"?  No - I don't mean Rocky IV and V, after Sylvester Stallone had made two iconic movie characters (Rocky and Rambo) into buffoons.  I mean that first Rocky movie - the one that earned the Oscar and the hearts of movie-goers everywhere.  This isn't back-handed praise for "Cinderella Man".<br /><br />With all due respect to Mr. Stallone, who gave the performance of his life in that, his first feature, he is not Russell Crowe.  James J. Braddock comes to living, breathing life in Mr. Crowe's performance, and Ron Howard was wise (as he so often is) choosing to pair himself once again with his "Beautiful Mind" star.  Unlike Rocky, which was set in it's current era, "Cinderella Man" begins moments before the great depression, then spends the first half of the movie showing us how severe things are in the depression.  As my momma would have said, these folks are "bad off".  Braddock earns thousands of dollars in an early bout - later in the film after injuries and the depression have beaten him to near despair he is deliriously happy at the opportunity to earn $250 in a match where he is likely to be beaten senseless.<br /><br />James J. Braddock broke his hand - several times we are told - and the boxing commission pulled his license after a particularly poor showing.  Not trained for any other career, but with a dogged determination to provide for his family, he shows up every day at the locked gates outside the loading docks so that he can work all day hauling heavy sacks to earn not nearly enough money to pay the landlord AND the electricity.  At one point his son steals a salami because he has heard that if there isn't enough to eat that families get broken up and the children sent to live with distant relatives.<br /><br />The thing that allows Cinderella Man to stand alongside "Rocky" and "Million Dollar Baby" and "Raging Bull" at the pinnacle of boxing films (aside from the cinematography, editing, writing and "little things" that the movie-makers get just right here) are the very human characterizations.  Rocky never has to go down to Madison Square Garden to beg for 18 dollars so that he can pay the electric bill and keep his family together.  At one point Braddock goes to the office where small financial handouts are given out to the needy.  The Braddocks have, indeed, become needy.  The woman on the otherside of the money cage sadly shakes her head.  "I never thought I'd see YOU here", she says.  Later, Braddock returns to that office to stand in line, and what he does there demonstrates part of why James J. Braddock became a folk hero to the people of the depression.<br /><br />In many cases, you know where this film is headed.  Howard, Crowe, Zellweger and Giamatti make the trip enjoyable nonetheless.</p></body></html>

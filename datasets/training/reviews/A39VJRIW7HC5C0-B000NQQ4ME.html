<meta name="summary" content="Half-decent chase flick marred by bloated length and plot hole"></head><body><p>Apocalypto is at times an energetic and kinetic chase film set in the jungles of Central America.  Worth a watch, and enjoyable for the most part, it does feature several drawbacks that hamper one's enjoyment of the film.  The first is that the movie is just too damn long.  It seems to take forever for Jaguar Paw and his fellow raiders to get to the top of the pyramid (right before the best-timed eclipse ever) so that the real meat of the movie can begin.  Character development is nice, but the journey to the pyramid seems to take forever and bad pacing never helps one's enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />Even more annoying was the gigantic plot hole that made no sense to me whatsoever.  You see, before being captured Jaguar Paw lowered his wife and child down into a giant pit in the ground so that the rival tribe wouldn't kill/rape them.  About halfway through the movie the pit starts filling up with water, which the audience is supposed to view as a bad thing that increases tension and gives Jaguar Paw urgency to get back home.  Why?  The water should A. let his wife and child live longer, as it will allow them to drink and B. allow them to reach the surface when the pit fills all the way.  Instead we're supposed to believe they're in danger of drowning--why?  They live right near a river and the gulf of mexico: they know how to swim and how to tread water.  Sure it might make sleeping somewhat difficult, but they should be in no immediate danger whatsoever.  Poor writing by Gibson in what is otherwise an interesting, if somewhat poorly paced film</p></body></html>

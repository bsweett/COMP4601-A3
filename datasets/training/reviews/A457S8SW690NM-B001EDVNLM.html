<meta name="summary" content="My favorite movie!"></head><body><p>I'm being sarcastic, so I hope you noticed. I never was a big Bond fan. They're all the same thing basically, Bond meets girl, Bond beats up bad guys, Bond is invincible. These movies really demonstrate the same invincibility tis man has. But, here we've gone too far. To call this movie unrealistic is unfair. It is the father of unrealism. There are maybe only two Bonds that are 5 star babies to me and this ain't one. It was in the "so called classics" that some were good. I say some. But, some of Connery's were great action flicks that you've gotta love. This movie is pathetic. It has Bond doing the usual but in horrible fashion. We see him go to prison, get his but kicked for what purpose? We all know he's going to live! Then he shows us that he is a master fencer (?), great with women, great with cars, great with guns, great with everything. Everyone would love to be this guy. I mean he survives the sun (which was somehow controlled?!?! I mean am I an idiot? Isn't that a little too unrealistic and absurd?!)jumps off a cliff making a parachute somehow and then using a little platform to surfboard in HUGE waves! What this? Sounds similiar to that idiotic scene at the start of Batman and Robin where they surfboard in mid air?! I guess so!<br /><br />So, if you like Bond and want to watch him do the same thing for the billionth time, then watch this pathectic movie, but if you're like me and want to see actually a good movie, then don't watch this horrid movie!</p></body></html>

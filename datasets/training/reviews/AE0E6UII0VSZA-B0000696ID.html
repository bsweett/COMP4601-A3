<meta name="summary" content="An inspiring and ultimately tear-jerking masterpiece"></head><body><p>As if seeing the little boy Elliot hug his new best friend E.T. at the end wasn't enough to make your tear ducts burn with the desire to let a few drip down your face, E.T.'s magically illuminated finger ignites with life and casts a warm glow onto the tearful face of the friend he's about to leave behind and says the words that warmed hearts around the world: &quot;I'll be right here.&quot; The music soars, E.T. picks up his plant, and the tears proceed to trickle down my face and land with a nice little plop on my pants before they are absorbed by the denim fabric. But they aren't tears of sadness, like they are when E.T. is defibrilated; they are tears of joy and happiness. This little creature whom I, as a viewer, have become so attached to, is finally getting what he wants: To go home, but at the cost of the first best friend he ever had. No one is good at goodbyes, and everyone knows this, which is what makes the ending to &quot;E.T.--The Extra-Terrestrial&quot; so wonderful. The movie makes your heart glad. It is wonderful, charming, scary, funny, realistic, visually stunning, and exciting as hell. How many times can you truly say that a single movie embodies all of those qualities, plus a lot more that I haven't even mentioned? A handful at most. &quot;E.T.&quot; is one of the few masterpieces I can claim to have seen. It is right up there on my list of all-time favorites with &quot;American Beauty&quot; and &quot;Magnolia,&quot; and it is the only movie to ever make me cry in front of company. You make poke fun at me if you will, but I'm no less of a man for admitting it, so keep your testosterone-seething jabs at my psyche to yourself. Thanks.</p></body></html>

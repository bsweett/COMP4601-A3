But that's fine too -- it is a pleasure to watch the likes of Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, and Truman Capote, oops, Phillip Seymour Hoffman meander their way through some pretty good country songs (though far short of the best from Altman's Nashville) and some truly awful jokes while death, in the form of a beautiful angel, stalks the stage.  Kevin Kline as a gumshoe and Tommy Lee Jones as a Christian radio owner zealot also have a wonderful time with their roles.  I got the impression that GK was hugely pleased to have so much talent on his show, if only in movie form.  But all this talent is immersed in, frankly, fluff, entertaining fluff, but fluff nonetheless.  Robert Altman's master talents were taxed not at all, kind of like watching Tiger Woods play putt-putt golf.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Interpret this"></head><body><p>Nicole Kidman plays an interpreter for the United Nations who accidentally overhears a conversation she thinks is linked to a possible assassination plot.  Sean Penn is the Secret Service agent assigned to investigate and/or protect her - it's never completely clear.  The movie holds together well for about the first hour, beginning with a tense scene set in Africa.  Gradually, we learn about Kidman and Penn's characters.  Penn is initially skeptical of Kidman's claims, which adds some nice tension.  However, the plot shifts dramatically during a confusing bus ride, and the movie's believability subsequently went out the window for me.  The script for "The Interpreter" reeks of doctoring - indeed Scott Zallian (Schindler's List) and others were supposedly brought in for re-writes.<br /><br />A major problem aside from the muddled plot is that Nicole Kidman's character is quite remote.  It's hard to sympathize with her when you never have any idea what she's thinking or feelings.  In this respect, her work and character here reminded me of her movie released just prior, the dismal "Birth."  Penn is solid in his role, but he's certainly had more to work with in other recent films (Mystic River, 21 Grams).  Unfortunately, the brilliant Catherine Keener is wasted in yet another movie.  Her role is generic, and there seems to be no rhyme or reason for when she appears.  She seems to be Sean Penn's partner, but then he seems to work alone quote a bit.  Anyway, she's sadly wasted here.<br /><br />"The Interpreter" made a bit of press as the first major release filmed at the United Nations.  This setting does help with a few scenes, particularly those featuring the General Assembly.  However, many of the U.N. scenes consist of stairwells or small offices, even a bathroom.  The overall effect is probably not worth the hassle, as Sidney Pollack reportedly had to fight voraciously for permission to film there.  Speaking of Pollack, "The Interpreter" is only his second film in the last decade, following the bomb, "Random Hearts."  Pollack was one of the most talented directors working from the late 60s (The Shoot Horses, Don't They?) through the mid-80s (Out of Africa), so it's somewhat perturbing to see him floundering with a mediocre thriller.  He has even contributed to this genre previously with the far superior "Three Days of the Condor" (1975); even "The Firm" (1993) is arguably better.<br /><br />In sum, "The Interpreter" is a decent thriller and time-filler, although it is rather old-fashioned in its storytelling and pacing.  In that respect, it has the feel of a 1970s thriller, although a weak one at that.  Extras include an unremarkable alternate ending and a very sedate director's commentary from Sidney Pollack.</p></body></html>

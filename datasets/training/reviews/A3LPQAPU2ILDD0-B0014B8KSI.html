<meta name="summary" content="A Good But Not Great Film"></head><body><p>Of course George Clooney in the title role was superb as usual, and Tom Wilkinson was touching in the pivotal role, but how Tilda Swinton won an Oscar totally baffles. Yes, she was the films antagonist and was quite capable in this role, but she just didn't have enough screen time or that much to do. She was so much better as the White Witch in 2005's Chronicles of Narnia, but of course received no nomination. But it seems 2007 was a year for minimal performances in the Best Supporting Actress category; Ruby Dee also comes to mind for American Gangster. Her's probably in honor of years of overlooked performances.<br /><br />A good movie that will entertain, but not great in a year that was not a standout for great filmmaking. Michael Clayton exposes big businesses and how far they're willing to go to coverup terrible atrocities, but somehow something seems lacking from this one.</p></body></html>

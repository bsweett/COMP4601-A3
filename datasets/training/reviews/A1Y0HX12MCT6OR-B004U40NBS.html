The projector died at the very end of the movie so maybe that was ruined a little for me but otherwise it is a very well made film that I'd recommend. But...<br /><br />God Damn Aronofsky, how many more people going through self-destruction do we have to see? I haven't seen the Fountain so I can't speak for that but Pi (and his only happy ending) shows someone driving himself crazy, Requiem for a Dream shows a group of people succumbing to drugs, and the Wrestler shows a burned out wrestler commit suicide. Now they're all great stories and all but is that all Darren can do? How about finding a new formula for once, one where a character isn't circling the drain for once? Just saying, I liked Black Swan a lot, but it feels like a retread of Aronofsky's previous works.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A hard-rocking film!"></head><body><p>This film starring Jack Black was a bigger hit for him compared to 2001's "Shallow Hal". If Chris Farley were alive today,he would have been perfect for the character of Dewey Finn,portrayed by Black. Farley played characters like Dewey,semi-obnoxious but kind. The film was written by Mike White who plays Dewey's buddy and roommate Ned Schneeblee. The most famous of all is Joan Cusack who is Rosalie Mullins,the principal of Horace Green Elementary School. Dewey,a heavy metal band's frontman is fired from the band and worse,is threatened with eviction from his apartment that he shares with Ned and Ned's girlfriend. To pay back rent,Dewey,who had shaved off his beard,takes a teaching position at an elementary school where Ned teaches also. After Dewey arrives,using his buddy's name,the classroom is definitely not the same! The kids in the class aren't learning math and English much anymore. Dewey teaches each kid how to play the guitar and keyboard. Before too long,loud,hard rock is emerging from the classroom. This is brought to the prncipal's attention after receiving a complaint from another faculty member. Dewey and the kids hide all the evidence before the principal enters the classroom. After Ned receives some kind of notice in the mail regarding something that he really wasn't involved in,he takes action,with the help of his girlfriend,by sending the police to the school during a PTA meeting,which there are many infuriated parents. Here's where Dewey discloses his real identity. He did the wrong thing for the right reason. But,now all the kids are talented musicians in their own right and are performing in a talent show with Dewey as the School Of Rock. The principal and the angry parents arrive at the performance way too late. There's also one scene where Dewey and the principal go on a date. Black played an awesome character in this film,I must admit. Hey,can you imagine Robin Williams in a film called "School Of Comedy",teaching kids how to be foul-mouthed stand-up comedians?</p></body></html>

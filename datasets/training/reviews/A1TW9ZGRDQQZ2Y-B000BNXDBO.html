I haven't laughed so hard at a movie in years. It is that funny. The two lead actors are likeable and there are some really funny scenes (weed bag dream comes to mind). This is one not to be overlooked and should be checked out next time you are at the video store. Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser) playing himself was a riot.</p></body></html>

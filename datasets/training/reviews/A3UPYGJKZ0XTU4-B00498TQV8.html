<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly Powerful Character Drama & Crime Thriller in the Backwoods."></head><body><p>"Winter's Bone" is a surprising dark thriller based on the novel by Daniel Woodrell, self-described author of "country noir". The unlikely heroine is 17-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), who cares for her mentally ill mother and younger brother and sister on their dilapidated property in the Ozarks, rural Missouri. She does her best to impart to her siblings the skills they will need to survive on this hardscrabble land with barely enough food to eat and no functional parents. If that weren't hardship enough, the Sheriff (Garret Dillahunt) informs Ree that her father Jessup, who makes crystal meth, used the family property to guarantee his bail bond...and then skipped bail. If Ree can't find Jessup before his court date, the family will lose its home. So she sets out to track him down and finds herself in a perilous position with no one willing to help.<br /><br />Debra Granik co-wrote this screenplay and directed the film, which was shot in just 24 1/2 days on location in Missouri. The environment is very much a character and a strong presence in every single shot, thanks to cinematographer Michael McDonough. At first I found the unrelenting destitution and hardness heavy-handed, but it seemed natural after a while. The fact that the film takes place primarily outdoors helps. The electrifying focal point is Ree as portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence. She's a young woman with a quiet determination, tough, unsentimental, but somehow confident in her ability to succeed. This spark of optimism is a bit of youthful naivet&eacute; in an otherwise cynical character, but it brings the audience to her like lightning to a rod. Ree is something to hear. It's her voice -what she says, not what she does- that is absolutely captivating.<br /><br />The DVD (Lionsgate 2010): Bonus features include an Alternate Opening (1 ? min), 4 Deleted Scenes, music credits (text), a theatrical trailer (2 ? min), and a music video for "Hardscrabble Elegy: Composed and Performed by Dickon Hinchliffe" (3 min). "The Making of Winter's Bone" (45 min) is behind-the-scenes footage, rehearsal footage, and includes some deleted scenes. There is no narration, just the clips strung together. There is also an audio commentary by director/co-writer Debra Granik and cinematographer Michael McDonough. They discuss the locations, music, cast, characters, cinematography, and some production design. This is more informative than the "Making Of" clips. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish.</p></body></html>

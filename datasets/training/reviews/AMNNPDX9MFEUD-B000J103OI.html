<meta name="summary" content="No chick flick here"></head><body><p>I went with the wife to see this back in the summer and enjoyed it so much we caught it a second time and just bought the dvd. I was surprised at how un-chick flick like it was. This is a well made if slightly corny (especially the less-than-satisfying ending) tale of self-discovery. The acting is top notch with Anne Hathaway being the weakest link. Her character has little to convey emotionally and she does a fair job of just that, but the other three major characters at Runway magazine are worth the price of admission. They save what might've been a cliche and turn it into a fun exploration of the world of fashion. Granted, some deep ideas (the double standard applied to powerful women, chosing between career and love) are glossed over, remember it is a fluffy movie based on a fluffy novel, so approach it as such.<br /><br />I agree with the general sentiment that (SPOILER ALERT!!!) Andrea should have blown off her painfully immature friends and gone for rhe gold, having the foresight to know that her relationship with the boyfriend wasn't going anywhere anyway, but she gives in to the picket fence and Hallmark duldrums instead of seizing the brass ring when it is so clearly within her view, but this is overanalysis where it is clearly not called for. Enjoy it for the light and fun treat it was intended to be - in that it succeeds quite pleasantly.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Clint Eastwood, Hillary Swank and a great boxing tale"></head><body><p>This movie is based on one short story taken from a collection of boxing tales by (author:F.X O'Toole). In this particular story, a manager is trying to turn a woman into a top boxing contender.<br /><br />This could so easily have been a smarmy or unbelievable film but, thank goodness, Eastwood has the directing and acting chops to pull it off and Hillary Swank proves yet again that she is an excellent actress, as she portrays a young woman desperate to make something of herself and with few other options in life. Eastwood is her manager and, as you'd expect, he is rather hardened and gruff and not open to managing a woman boxer (at first). He doesn't believe women should be boxers, period..end of discussion...and how and why he changes his mind is believeable.<br /><br />As he does so well, Eastwood manages to stay away from sentimentality, letting his feelings (especially the softer ones) show only at critical moments in the film - and even then, he never overplays the moments, trusting viewers to get the point, respecting his audience.<br /><br />  Swank makes the most of her angular features and hard edges and is convincing as a poor girl who is desperate for a break, someone who has run out of options. She looks and acts hungry - for a break, for success, for some way out of her dead end life.<br /><br />The tone of the film is equally wonderful and the lighting and cinematography are crucial to setting the right mood. I really loved this film and recommend you make time for it as well.</p></body></html>

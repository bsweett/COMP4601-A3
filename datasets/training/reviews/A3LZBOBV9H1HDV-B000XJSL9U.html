The cast led by Bruce Willis (returning to the role that made him famous, John McClane) is excellent. The directing by Len Wiseman (who also directed "Underworld" (2003) & its sequel, "Underworld: Evolution" (2006) is excellent. The story by Mark Bomback (who wrote the story and screenplay to "Godsend" (2004) & David Marconi (who also wrote the story to "Enemy Of The State" (1998) and the screenplay by Bomback is excellent. The music by Marco Beltrami (who also did the music to "Underworld: Evolution" and the upcoming "3:10 To Yuma" (2007) is excellent. The cinematography by Simon Duggan (who also did the cinematography to "Underworld: Evolution" & the upcoming "The Mummy 3" (2008) is excellent. The film editing by Nicolas De Toth (who also did the film editing to "Underworld: Evolution") is excellent. The casting by Deborah Aquila & Mary Tricia Wood (both who also did the casting to "Underworld: Evolution" & most recently, "Evan Almighty" (2007) is excellent. The production design by Patrick Tatopoulos (who also did the production design to "Underworld: Evolution") is excellent. The art direction by Beat Frutiger (who also did the art direction to "Transformers" (2007) & James Hegedus is excellent. The set decoration by Robert Gould is excellent. The costume design by Denise Wingate is excellent. Just like "Rocky Balboa" last year (2006), this one is the best in its series since the original. This is an action-packed, stunt-filled feast and one of the better action films of recently.</p></body></html>

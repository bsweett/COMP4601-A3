Even a step above all the female roles. I think there are two of those.<br /><br />I think movies like this are hard to make. Troy and Alexander both ran into the same problems. If you're not familiar with the history you'll be pretty much lost when you view the film. I'm sure this is a good movie but I didn't really understand it and I was pretty bored up until the last battle.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just too dumb for this movie. Which is possible.</p></body></html>

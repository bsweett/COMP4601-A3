Alison Lohman who is really over 22 in real life is great and believable as the innocent 14 year old daughter of Nic's character. This movie is done in the same light tone as "Catch Me If You Can," the only difference being that it is way better. The only small problem I have with the movie is the cheesy tacked on ending that follows the words..ONE YEAR LATER. I would actually suggest leaving the theater instead of watching the last 10 mins. The original ending ends on a depressing but realistic note following a series of plot twists, which was great for me. The tacked on ending is too sappy and detracts from realism of the characters we have gotten to know over the past 2 hours. Basically the ending was too "hollywood" for me and the other people I saw it with. But we all agreed, ending aside, this is one of the best and funniest films of the year. Let the Oscar nods roll.</p></body></html>

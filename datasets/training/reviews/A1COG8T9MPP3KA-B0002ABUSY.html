<meta name="summary" content="People Ran Out Of the Theater, They were so scared!"></head><body><p>Well I saw the movie, a midnight showing.<br />There is about 10 minutes of film before the actual credits start. During this 10 minutes, people were screaming and cheering, it was that action packed. Then when the credits started, people started applauding, the first 10 minutes got our adrenilane up that much!!!<br />It pretty much gets straight to the point, as a group of people run straight to the mall and lock themselves in. Before the televisions go off the air, there is a chilling moment. A preacher looks directly in the camera and says "When there is no more room in hell, the dead shall walk the earth." Then the characters realize just like the book of Revelations, that it is Armeggedon, the end of the world.<br />My friend I was with was jumping through the whole film. He said he has never seen a movie that made him jump out of his skin like that. You pretty much stay on edge...<br />many young girls got up and ran out of the theater while their boyfriends chased after them..<br />I loved the film, although I think they rippped off '28 days Later' too much. It wasn't really a remake of the original as it was simply based on that movie. I loved the movie, although I could point out weak spots, but over all it was quite a ride!!<br />One hint, when the ending credits start to roll, don't leave, there is more to the story..</p></body></html>

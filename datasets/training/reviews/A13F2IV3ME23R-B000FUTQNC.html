<meta name="summary" content="Hey, THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT ----- ENJOY!"></head><body><p>Refreshing from all the foul languaged movies out there - entertaining plot - who cares if it has been done before.<br /><br />This was a good set of actors - and who was the good looking guy that Jack [H. Ford] done in?  Enjoyed Robert Patrick but wish he had done a bit more chasing.<br /><br />It is an entertaining movie that I don't mind watching again [2nd time around] and still good.<br /><br />Hey, Ford doesn't look that old in the special features.  Our problem is, we are still looking for Hans Solo or Indiana Jones.<br /><br />Enjoy - it is worth watching - Definitely Recommended.</p></body></html>

Having spent several days in isolation from the tyrannical Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) because Nicholson would not let his officers work manual labor on the bridge, a bridge Saito is charged with having finished by mid May.  The first hour of the film is a battle of wills between the two men, the last 90 minutes deals with the bridge itself and its place in the war.  Eventually a team is sent in to detonate the bridge, leading to one of the most exciting climax scenes in the history of film.<br /><br />The movie is presented here in a two disc set which features an excellent transfer as well as some great behind the scenes material you will find interesting.  The package includes a short booklet detailing the challenges the filmmakers encountered while making the movie, including weather problems, difficulties with casting, and the actual set with the bridge itself, one of the most fascinating sights ever.  The story about the destruction of the bridge is incredible, some of the details you don't see on screen.<br /><br />As a film the casting and story are impeccable.  Guiness is perfect as the stone faced Col. Nicholson, who honors the British army and their capability over anything else, which leads him to some rather questionable decisions while in command.  Hayakawa is strong and convincing as the Japanese commander who rules with a desperate iron fist, as he is up against a deadline.  William Holden stars as the only American in the movie, who escapes the camp and later becomes an integral part of the final plan (against his will).  All three are fantastic.  This is a movie I can watch at any time, repeatedly.  One of the best purchases I have ever made.</p></body></html>

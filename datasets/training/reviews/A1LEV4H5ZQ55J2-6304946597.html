<meta name="summary" content="The Warrior General"></head><body><p>General George Patton was a high ranking officer of World War II. He placed himself within the historical significance of the war, and did this based on prior historical military engagements that had been fought on the same fields of battle.<br /><br />The film is a wartime biography of the General; the ups and downs that tell us so much about him. As a General he must have had political savvy to have risen to that rank. Nevertheless, he was always stepping on the toes of higher-ups and chastised for it.<br /><br />There is no doubt as to General Patton's contribution to the war, or his love and duty to country. Yet, he was a bit of a rebel.<br /><br />The first disc is the story PATTON.<br /><br />The second disc is filled with extra features on everything from the making of "Patton" to the staging of tank battles.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Okay for its time, which you can tell was long ago."></head><body><p>Certainly not a bad movie, certainly not worth 11 oscars, i guess nothing better came out that year, because this movies so long they could only make this.  At almost 4 hours making it to the end without skipping some scenes is impossible, but there is definetly some quality stuff here.  The chariot  race (i dont call it the finale because it happens an hour before the end of the movie) is incredible, the camera work is excellent and the race is pretty brutal with guys getting crushed by flipped chariots, horses trampling men, and juda takes a dive over the front of the chariot (it was actually kinda funny to see this guy flip over the chariot so quickly but its real).  There is a battle on a slave ship which is pretty violent for a G rated movie because it shows slaves with cut off hands and feet with bone sticking out and blood.  Those two sequences and the crucificxion are the only real events that occur however, as with many other old films this is a huge flaw, the film is entirely too long with way too much irrelevant dialogue.  Its definetly not worth 11 oscars maybe 4, if Ridley Scott were to remake it i could see it winning 11 oscars because it is a good story to work off of.  Overall its a fairly average film, good, not great, for its time it was very good, but now its nothing special.  People who are 50 watch this, people born after this movie was made watch LOTR.  6 out of a 10.</p></body></html>

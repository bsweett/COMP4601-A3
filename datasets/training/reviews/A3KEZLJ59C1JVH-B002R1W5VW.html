When Angela takes an interest in her father's profession, Roy allows her to take part in a job that he's running with his parner (Sam Rockwell).  The tables are quickly turned and it becomes unclear who's conning who in this fast-pace "dramedy" that will keep the audience guessing until the very end.</p></body></html>

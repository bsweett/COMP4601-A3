A friend really wanted to see this movie, and as a film buff who does not discriminate against any film, I tagged alone. I found the movie to be entertaining and fun, but nothing special. In development for almost 14 years, ever since a skull from the title characters in the Alien film series appeared in the spaceship trophy room in Predator 2, this film has been highly anticipated ever since. The Alien Vs. Predator story has crossed over virtually all forms of media before becoming a feature film. There was a successful comic book series, toy line, multiple video games, sound track (of the PC game) and even a card series, so it was about time a screen version hit theaters. While the film was very enjoyable, I think the PG-13 rating hurt it quite a bit. There were moments of pure tension that were cut short with bad editing so as not to show any gore. I found that unneccessary and bothersome. A solid R rating would have benefited the film quite a bit and added to the tense atmosphere. Also, at 87 minutes, including credits, the film was a bit too short. I would have loved to see some backstory and more character development. Other than that, the film was a pretty decent entry in the Sci-Fi/Horror genre, fun and fast-paced, and makes me look forward to seeing the rest of the films in this "prequel."</p></body></html>

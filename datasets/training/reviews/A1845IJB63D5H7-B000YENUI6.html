<meta name="summary" content="Added an accent and style to the crimes of state proxies"></head><body><p>Whether the extreme brutality, of slashing arteries from the very beginning and throughout the movie, was justified is probably a question of marketing than reason. The two fighting factions, the Russian state ex-intelligence mob and the Chechnya's mobs embarking on settling their differences in exile. The scenario presents the moviemaker with great riches of accents, characters, violence, and intriguing codes of conduct of ruthless but calculating proxies.<br /><br />The new angle here in the strict code of conduct of loyalty to hierarchy with considerable respect to the most vulnerable: children and women. The very characteristic features of the Russian mobs of excessive drinking and prostitution were contrasted with greater discipline, higher moral code, and humane empathy of most of the mob members. In the background with the British raised Russian nurse who seem to have departed to far from her ancestor's tradition that upset her uncle's obsession of racial purity.<br /><br />The movie was engaging beyond doubt by virtue is plot that make the viewer shift his emotion from one side to the other. The apparently street thug and ruthless killer, working as a chauffeur was transformed to a smart, decent mobster possessing mercy for the underage rapped girls and kidnapped baby. Amidst apparently endless murders and sex and betrayal there were few strong moments of noble consideration for the lives of innocent people. As if the mob was truly executing a highly scrutinized court of its own.</p></body></html>

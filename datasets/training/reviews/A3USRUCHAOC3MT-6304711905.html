<meta name="summary" content=""Wyatt Earp" is More Accurate Historically, But This Is By Far A More Entertaining Movie."></head><body><p>In spite of living in Arizona, I did not have much of a historical view of the Gunfight at the OK Corral, even though I visited Tombstone.  (My only information was a Star Trek episode and a series in the comic strip "Mandrake The Magician", which both make no historical claims.)  So I watched "Wyatt Earp" and now "Tombstone".  By the way, the day I watched "Tombstone," there was a Bizarro cartoon titled "Gunfight At The OK Chorale."<br /><br />For those who want to get to the gist, I will say that I think "Wyatt Earp" is probably more accurate historically, but I found "Tombstone" much more entertaining.  Where "Tombstone" succeeds over "Wyatt Earp":<br /><br />1.  The Gunfight is more exciting.<br /><br />2.  Kurt Russell's Wyatt is more likeable and identifiable with than Kevin Costner's.<br /><br />3.  The villains are more dastardly here.<br /><br />4.  The friendship between Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday is better developed here.<br /><br />5.  The ending does not drag, and is more satisfying.<br /><br />The only things that are better about "Wyatt Earp":  Mare Winningham's portrayal of Mattie (Earp's deserted, alcoholic wife) is light years ahead of Dana Wheeler-Nicholson's, and Linden Ashby is a more vibrant Morgan Earp.  As far as the portrayals of Doc Holiday, Val Kilmer's here and Dennis Quaid's in "Wyatt Earp" are equal.<br /><br />Now, for those who want a more in-depth comparison, here goes:<br /><br />1.  "Wyatt Earp" is more concerned with the life of Earp, while "Tombstone" is concerned with the gunfight, the events leading up to it, and the aftermath (though "Wyatt Earp" touches on the trial of the Earps and Holiday, while "Tombstone" does not).  Thus, the longer "Wyatt Earp" spends half of its time looking at Earp before his arrival at Tombstone.  Also, "Tombstone" does not deal with the Earps struggles as businessmen before returning to being lawmen.<br /><br />2.  "Tombstone" introduces the equivalent of the mafia with "The Cowboys".  Ike Clanton here is only a henchman with Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe) and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) being the chief villains and gang ring-leaders.  While there is clear opposition to the Earps in "Wyatt Earp", the cowboys are not as developed.<br /><br />3.  "Wyatt Earp" starts off with Wyatt waiting for his brothers to tell him what the Clantons are up to, and then leading them to the gunfight.  "Tombstone" has Wyatt being very reluctant to get into the law-keeping business, with Virgil (excellently portrayed by Sam Elliott) and Morgan proceeding him.  Also, in "Tombstone" it is Virgil who leads the heroes march to the OK Corral.<br /><br />4.  The relationship between Mattie and Wyatt is not as detailed here as in "Wyatt Earp."  Likewise, Wyatt is more of the instigator of the adulterous affair with Josephine Marcus in "Wyatt Earp", while Dana Delaney's interpretation has Marcus being more of a seductress.  As a result of these two items, "Tombstone" makes Wyatt a little more forgivable than in "Wyatt Earp," because it makes him more of a victim, and Mattie less sympathetic.  Also, the ending of "Tombstone" mentions Mattie's death, which "Wyatt Earp" does not.<br /><br />5.  On the subject of women, Holiday's girlfriend Kate (here, played by Joanna Pacula) is better looking than her "Wyatt Earp" counterpart.<br /><br />If you want history and don't mind being a little bored, get "Wyatt Earp".  But if you want an enjoyable and entertaining adventure, get this one!!!  And when you plan on watching this movie, why not get ready by stopping at the grocery store, and get some pizza first.  What kind of pizza?  Tombstone, of course.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Fun Family Movie That's Loaded With Action"></head><body><p>Dreamworks has scored a major hit with this fun movie that the entire family will enjoy.<br /><br />Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a young viking-in-training.  Pressured by his father Stoick the Great (Gerard Butler), Hiccup is supposed to learn how to slay dragons like all vikings do. Hiccup has been led to believe that all dragons are evil and must be killed before the dragons kill them.  Believing what he's been hearing, Hiccup makes a special weapon of his own to bring down one of the feared dragons.<br /><br />Hiccup manages to bring down a night fury; the most feared dragon of all.  But instead of being excited for his deed, Hiccup feels bad for the injured dragon.  Soon, the two have become close friends, and Hiccup has named him Toothless.  In no time, Hiccup has fashioned a saddle and is soaring high in the sky on Toothless' back.<br /><br />But, Hiccup still has his father to deal with.  Stoick, thrilled at Hiccup's bringing down the dragon, has insisted that he begin formal dragon training.  The only thing that Hiccup likes about it is that he gets to be near Astrid (America Ferrera).  During the course of his training, Hiccup begins to learn that the dragons aren't really evil at all; they are just like the vikings, hoping to survive.  However, convincing his father will be another matter.  Hiccup and Toothless soon discover that the dragons are merely pawns in a larger game controlled by a huge, menacing creature.  Will Hiccup, Astrid, and the others be able to save the dragons, or will the creature destroy both the dragons and the vikings?<br /><br />I've seen numerous animated movies with my children, and I have to rate "How to Train Your Dragon" as one of the best.  The special effects are excellent, and the story is good, too.  I enjoyed watching the relationship develop between Hiccup and Toothless, and the comedy left me laughing out loud.  My three kids are big fans, too.  For a fun family movie, watch "How to Train Your Dragon".  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

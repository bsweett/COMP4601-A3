<meta name="summary" content="I Loved this movie!!!!!!"></head><body><p>I actually loved this movie because it was different, well written, and very innovative.I can can only speak for myself when I say that I have never seen anything like &quot;Final Destination&quot; .I didn't want to miss a moment of this movie because I just had to know who was going to die next. I love the whole &quot;Cheating deaths design&quot; theme. Devon Sawa was great in the movie, and I thought the whole movie was great.</p></body></html>

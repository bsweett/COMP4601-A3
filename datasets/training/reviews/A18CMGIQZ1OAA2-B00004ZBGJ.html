<meta name="summary" content="Worst planet of the apes movie!"></head><body><p>okay ill rephrase, other than the remakes this is the worst planet of the apes movie.  It doesnt keep my attention. Its boring, the characters are dull.  Its simply a tie off movie.<br /><br />*Spoiler alert*<br />the bad guys get it, the good guys win, people and apes learn to live together as equals.<br />okay whoever saw that happening raise your hand.<br /><br />since like every single favorite character of mine was dead in this one i went into it with very little expectation. taylors dead *explosion, that scene was intense*, Ziras dead (zira was my favorite character of all, i think she was by far the most likeable in the her films of any human or ape), Cornelius is dead , Zaius is dead &lt;even though lets face it, he asked for it>, Nova is dead &lt;very sad>. To me though as time has gone on more characters have been introduced and well, caesar, lisa and cornelius have replaced zira and cornelius as far as peaceful apes go, its just not the same. When there are no characters from the original installment to me it loses touch with what it is.<br /> to me by the battle of the planet of the apes it was totally boring to me.  im debating seeing the rise of the planet of the apes. luckily i only paid a dollar for this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Occasional Chuckle amongst gross political incorrectness"></head><body><p>Sure, this movie was over the top in un-political correctness, and that was how it was supposed to be.  It is a fictional movie that made not only the main caracter look ignorant, but the folks around him.  This is filmed much like the Jackass films, ambush style greetings, shocking things with no clothing ect...  But this has the bashing of cultures tossed in, like the jewish community, and the extreme right christian fundamentals, which is garunteed to push buttons.  Overall, just not that great of a movie, great concept though, and if you shut your mind down for a minute and realize how rediculous some of the stuff in the movie is (like the fight between him and his friend, or the talk of his family) you have to chuckle once in a while.  If you must see this, just rent it, don't buy it until you know if you like it or not.</p></body></html>

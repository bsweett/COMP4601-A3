Maybe, because even today I like the old TV series, so I keep giving Tom Cruise another shot to get it right. They tone down some of the ludricous stunts. This movie, all the stunts seem somewhat possible to me.  Although, Tom Cruise (Ethan) does escape twice from being completely bound and watched by captors by simultaneously fighting the captors and escaping his bonds. It pushes the limits of imagination a little. The battle scene on the bridge was good and exciting.  The whole marriage subplot adds a sympathetic note to the whole story. Hoffman as the villian plays it well. He is a cool calculating murderer and he has fun with it. The cover stories Ethan (Cruise) gives to his wife are hilarious. He is going to a conference in Texas so won't be able to call her for a few days. He is supposed to be some kind of engineer. Is Texas a 3rd world country? The exploding bomb in the head concept was silly too. I don't know if it is possible, but how they disarm the bomb seems silly.<br /><br />I still don't know if I recommend the movie, but there was some nice touches in this one. It is superior to the previous two in the series. By the way, the mole in the organization is very predictable.</p></body></html>

While I liked the spin the cast put on their roles and the modern visuals of the characters, an overall cohesion was lacking in the direction that left me wanting more.  Wrapping the classic story in a modern metaphor of innocence lost and adult perspective on childhood was an original take.  The film's a good one to watch if you're a Burton or Depp fan, or if you enjoy dark fantasy, but likely not for fans of the storybook variety of Alice.</p></body></html>

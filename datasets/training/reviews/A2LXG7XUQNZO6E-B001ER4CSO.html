<meta name="summary" content="Now THIS Is Hellboy!"></head><body><p>Lemme just start off by saying that I really did enjoy the first Hellboy though, for me, it never really worked as well as I'd hoped. It was beautiful to look at, the characters were startlingly accurate and the storyline & dialogue were on point but I just wasn't feeling it, if you know what I mean? It's hard to explain but the entire thing felt a bit soulless to me, as crazy as that sounds. Del Toro is a visionary, Mignola's comic book concept is unparalleled and Perlman's performance as the titular character was inspired but none of it seemed to gel in the right way.<br /><br />Hellboy II: The Golden Army brings all the stunning visuals, award-winning FX & CG and phenomenal acting presented in the first film and runs wild with them in a free-for-all of imaginative monster mayhem! The sequel has more excitement, more emotion and the characters have certainly taken on a life of their own! If you enjoyed the first, you're going to love the follow-up, if you weren't able to get into the first; you're going to find this to be everything the first wasn't.<br /><br />I seriously enjoyed Hellboy II: The Golden Army, it was overflowing with action, adventure and some of the coolest creature designs I've seen since Nightbreed! As if a freakin' cool movie wasn't enough, Universal gives us this huge 3-Disc DVD release that was packed with more special features than I knew what to do with! I still haven't gotten through all of them! This is a party movie, a buddy film and a family flick all rolled up into one. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

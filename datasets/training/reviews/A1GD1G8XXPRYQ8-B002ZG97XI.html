<meta name="summary" content="Hot tube time machine definitely recommended"></head><body><p>It was pretty fun to watch it with a sweet end. Rated R for a reason or few : ) I recommend it just for a laugh. it's not all just a comedy, it's more about a friendship, families, people with problems and some sci-fi adventure in hot tube time machine. Many scenes are just plainly hilarious. And Chevy Chase played a funny role. Oh I just overall liked it. It is a drama,a comedy and science fiction all together. Give it a shot!</p></body></html>

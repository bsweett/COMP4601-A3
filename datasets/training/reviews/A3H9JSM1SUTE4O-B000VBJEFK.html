<meta name="summary" content="A RARE & PERFECT FILM"></head><body><p>For a long time my private mantra was: "Vouloir c'est pouvoir."  For me, this meant: "If you can think it, you can do it."  Ratatouille is a wonderful expression of this idea.  The audacious conceit is about a rural French rat who dreams of going to Paris and becoming a world-renowned chef.<br /><br />For a multitude of reasons, many aficionados of animation and great cinema still consider this the best film of the last decade.  The inspired direction is by Brad Bird, Jan Pinkava.  There are few perfect films; this is one of them.</p></body></html>

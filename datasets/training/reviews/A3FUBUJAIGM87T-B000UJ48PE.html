<meta name="summary" content="Blood and gore signifying much ado about nothing."></head><body><p>Devoid of any real horror other than your typical modern day shock value styled horror, Eli Roth and company follow up the dubious success of the original "Hostel" with "Hostel II".  To the credit of Roth and others, they did attempt something different in their sequel.  However, with that being said, the problem remains from the first movie and that simply is that "Hostel II", like the original, simply is not scary at all.  Unfortunately, like the original, "Hostel II" relies upon the audience's shock and other emotions stemming from the extreme violence that is put on film.  "Hostel II" represents blood and gore for the sake of blood and gore with a very uncompelling storyline.  The fact that they did do a pretty good job with the blood and gore in this movie is something that the makers of this movie should be commended for, but the lack of atmosphere and scares are glaring in this so-called horror movie.  Of course, this is part and parcel of where the horror genre is heading these days, and that is a shame.  This new age horror is really a dime a dozen.  Granted, Roth and company go to extremes to put disturbing pieces of violence on film relying on its shock value rather than a compelling storyline.<br /><br />The concept behind the movie, while unique, fails to instill terror in the audience.  Instead, the viewer develops a feeling of disdain for most of the characters in this movie except for maybe Beth to a certain extent--although I did not think she was that good of a protagonist.  Moreover, the movie's incessant reliance on gore, which is basically what the movie is all about, overshadows plot and character development as well as the story itself.  I know I have said this before, but you can have all the blood and gore you want times ten, but if it signifies nothing but blood and gore for the sake of blood and gore, you are not going to produce a good horror movie.  I mean let's face it: there's nothing scary about "Hostel II", simply nothing.  "Hostel II" is really about the dark sickos in this world who are sadistic and take pleasure in the torture of other human beings.  It is scary that there are people like this in the world, e.g. Ted Bundy, Henry Lee Lucas, Pee Wee Gaskins, etc., but the movie, in and of itself, is completely devoid of any sense of imaginative and stylized horror other than the shock and disturbing value it does produce with its graphic depictions of violence.<br /><br />For my money, I just do not think this is enough to create a good horror movie, and it is only further evidence of what Eli Roth is all about as a director.  Actually, I liked the original better than the sequel because it's more entertaining (that is certainly not saying much), but I did not think either was a good horror movie.  In short, these "Hostel" movies and movies like them are nothing more than unimaginative movies about torture and extreme violence designed for shock value and nothing more while completely lacking in story, suspense, style, substance and atmosphere, all of which, at least in my opinion, are essential ingredients to any good horror movie.  With that being said, all of you gorehounds out there, and you know who you are, will probably enjoy this flick as it does contain some serious blood and gore.</p></body></html>

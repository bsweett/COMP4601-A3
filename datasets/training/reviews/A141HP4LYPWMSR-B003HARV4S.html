<meta name="summary" content=""Who Knows What Actually Happened?" ~ The Art Of Bending Nature's Laws"></head><body><p>"Life and Death, Space and Time, Fate and Chance," what is reality and what is illusion? With its sepia-toned cinematography and lush turn-of-the-century Vienna setting `The Illusionist' presents to the audience a mesmerizing period piece that truly bends natures laws as it transports the viewer to another time, another place.<br /><br />I was drawn into the landscape of this film in a way I haven't been in quite some time. Along with the magnificent setting, costumes and soundtrack there are some wonderful performances within. Edward Norton's intense, stoic persona and brooding passion for his childhood sweetheart is the heart and soul of this production, perfectly complimented by the lovely ethereal presence of Jessica Biel as his lifelong love, Sophie. The film also offers yet another amazing performance by Paul Giamatti as police inspector Uhl and a villainous and obsessive role perfectly delivered by Rufus Sewell as Crown Prince Leopold.<br /><br />Now you see it, now you don't. My advice, SEE IT!</p></body></html>

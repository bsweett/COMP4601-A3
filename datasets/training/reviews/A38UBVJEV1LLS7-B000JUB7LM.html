<meta name="summary" content="A Lovely Movie, With a Kick (or Punch)"></head><body><p>With a cast like Eastwood, Swank, and Freeman, how could this movie go wrong? Well it couldn't, and it didn't. It was full of tour de force performances full of passion and physically demanding work, and every cast member was up to the task. The movie centers on a female boxer (Swank) and her relationship with her reluctant trainer (Eastwood). The film also, beautifully incorporates a story about Frankie (Eastwood) and long-time associate Eddie (Freeman), from whom many of Frankie's insecurities stem. The only problem with the film is that they try to incorporate a bit with Frankie having it out with his Priest, but the emotion seems a bit forced. However, this does nothing to hurt the picture. In the end, this is a story about family (blood and formed) and love, and each of these themes is presented perfectly, with a few good "punch-lines."</p></body></html>

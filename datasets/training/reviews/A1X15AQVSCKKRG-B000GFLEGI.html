<meta name="summary" content="Awesome zombie flick by the master George A Romero!!!"></head><body><p>Awesome zombie masterpiece!!!<br /><br />A true example of Romero's genius, this was truly a keeper for fans. I was really glad I went to see it when it came out and the audience pretty much enjoyed it.<br /><br />However, the movie was not bolstered by 28 Days Later (an awful movie) nor RE, but it's bolstered as a great zombie flick because of the fact that's it's done  by the Master of Zombie<br /><br />movies, George A. Romero.<br /><br />Romero knows how to do zombie flicks, the ones every other third rated director (Paul W.A Anderson, Uwe Boll), try to copy but fail miserably at it.<br /><br />Why do they fail? Crappy special effects,limited or no story, bad directing, well with the master at the helm that wasn't going to happen, nor we're we going to have a major disaster on our hands. Romero really gave his followers something good again, and he needs to recognized again for it.<br /><br />The fourth zombie flick in the Dead saga finds a couple of renegades for hire who work for a rich white tycoon named Kaufman (excellenty done in fashion by Dennis Hopper).<br /><br />Hopper as Kaufman was deliciously evil, humorous and twisted. He reminded of George W. Bush in a way, he is an evil conservative who could care less about people dying in his own country,<br /><br />all he cares about is making a profit, and saving his own hide all the while spewing propaganda about what he's done when everything he's done has been for himself.<br /><br />This is actually an element of the movie from interviews George A Romero has given that he actually wanted to do more. Besides giving us a great zombie flick to eat out popcorn with he wanted to implement political and social satires. Always the brilliant<br /><br />director as he did with Dawn of the Dead, he does so here. Well done George.<br /><br />The gore for the movie was extremely high so gorehounds will not be disappointed at all. There's also certainly a high amount of action and pulse pounding violence and suspense to keep people in their proverbial seats for the whole viewing. This truly is a great movie.<br /><br />Even Tom Savini has a cameo in the movie.<br /><br />Moving on the mercenaries after killing many zombies, have a fallig ou. Cholo (John Leguizamo) who as another Latino actor and one of the best gives a great performance, takes into custody Dead Reckoning the advanced zombie killing machine unit. Riley (Simon Baker) hates Cholo ruthlessness but deep down they both are the same.<br /><br />Anyhow Kaufmann enlists Riley's help in getting the thing back all the way Kauffman has ideas of his own. Eventually everyone gets what they deserve at the end and of the top of that we have two hours of non stop zombie action!!!<br /><br />To sum up, this is a great zombie flick, and it's a great horor movie overall, George A Romero kicks butt and maybe Uwe Boll and every other mediocre horror director could learn a lot from him.</p></body></html>

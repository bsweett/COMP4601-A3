<meta name="summary" content="Incredible special effects highlight dumb movie"></head><body><p>The Day After Tomorrow should be seen on the large screen.  The special effects are utterly fantastic.  It was fun to watch Los Angeles destroyed by tornados and New York City covered by freezing ice.  Director Roland Emmerich, however, should have picked a script with better dialogue.  Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Ian Holm, Emmy Rossum and Sela Ward are provided lines so lame that I sensed they barely uttered them with a straight face.  These people are supposedly suffering from hunger and the pain of losing loved ones.  They always, though, appear well fed and fairly cheerful.  What about having to go to the toilet?  Sanitation concerns are ignored. A vending machine containing snacks is left untouched until the main characters think of breaking into it.  Is everybody else seeking shelter in the huge library a complete idiot?  As a global warming propaganda vehicle, this film fails miserably.  I totally forgot The Day After Tomorrow's political message.  The story line is too ridiculous to be effective. Escapist movies still have to be somewhat logical.  Emmerich seems so preoccupied with the weather disasters that he barely had time for anything else.  Perhaps he should have focussed on these scenes and allowed someone else to direct the rest of the movie?  Did his ego get in the way?  Why didn't anyone say something?  Couldn't the producer sense that something was wrong?</p></body></html>

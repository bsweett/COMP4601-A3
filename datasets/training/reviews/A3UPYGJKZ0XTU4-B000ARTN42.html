<meta name="summary" content="Victory in the Boxing Ring & Over Poverty During The Great Depression."></head><body><p>"Cinderella Man" follows the boxing career of James J. Braddock, whom the newspapers dubbed "Cinderella Man" when he rose from abject poverty to be World Heavyweight Championship in 1935, inspiring scores of fans who were also suffering the bane of the Great Depression. Braddock (Russell Crowe) led a comfortable middle-class life in New Jersey with wife Mae (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) and their children, with a shot at the light heavyweight crown, when he lost his home and savings in the Crash of 1929 and then lost his career to injuries. Like so many Americans at the time, Jim and Mae couldn't feed their children or pay the heating bill. In 1934, a year after the Boxing Commission decommissioned him, manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) got Jim a chance to fight Corn Griffin for $250 when his opponent backed out at the last minute. No time to train. A one-shot deal. He was expected to lose. But it was Jim Braddock's only chance to earn a living, and it was the only chance he needed.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is a superb character actor who also has great presence, so he's perfect to play a star athlete. James Braddock was a modest and unassuming man, and this is a nice understated performance by Crowe. In contrast to a well-spoken, big personality like Captain Aubrey in "Master and Commander", Braddock's mindset is conveyed with few words and simple gestures. We see the contrasting personalities of Jim Braddock and arrogant, flamboyant Heavyweight Champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko), who had proven himself a killer in the ring. Some of the film's most interesting scenes concern the anxieties and politics anticipating the Baer-Braddock Championship fight. And boxing fans will enjoy the fight scenes, which often place the camera in the ring.<br /><br />Braddock became a symbol of hope to thousands of disillusioned boxing fans and New Jersey natives: A hardworking, honest Everyman who had suffered great loss and triumphed. To reflect the demoralized American psyche of the Great Depression, the backdrop against which this story is told, the cinematography is on the dark side. Indoor scenes are often shot low-key, with very little light. But I never had the impression that there was not enough light in critical areas of the frame, as is too often the case when people try to use low-key lighting with color film. Really nice work by cinematographer Salvatore Totino.<br /><br />I feel I should mention Paul Giamatti's role as manger Joe Gould, because I don't normally like Giamatti. His characters tend to be whiney and neurotic. But Gould isn't that at all and really shows what Giamatti can do if he stays away from the misfit roles. Jim Braddock's granddaughter, actress Rosemarie DeWitt, plays the Braddocks' friend Sara Wilson in the film, by the way. "Cinderella Man" is a finely crafted biopic that successfully conveys the anguish of Braddock's hardships, his gratitude at getting a second chance, and the joy so many fans felt at his triumph, which makes it a successful sports film as well. Sometimes I come away from Director Ron Howard's films feeling that he is very good at some things, but depth of emotion isn't one of them. I didn't have that impression with "Cinderella Man". This film bears Ron Howard's straightforward narrative style, but its emotions are not showy or superficial.</p></body></html>

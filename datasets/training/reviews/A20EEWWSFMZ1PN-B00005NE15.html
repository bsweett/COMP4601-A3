<meta name="summary" content="In the misty moon light"></head><body><p>This is a definite must for any Barbeau collector. She keeps up her high standards found in "Swamp Thing" (1982) and "Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death" (1989).  This film also is designed to add to your John Carpenter collection.<br /><br />Fog night and slow pacing will drive you up the wall. The unseen is just as spooky as the seen. There is gold, revenge, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Janet Leigh. What, want more? What if we throw in John Houseman and Hal Holbrook? Still more? There is a lot more. But don't get greedy. Sit back and enjoy what you can see in The Fog.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A7Q1UQ">Swamp Thing ~ Louis Jourdan</a></p></body></html>

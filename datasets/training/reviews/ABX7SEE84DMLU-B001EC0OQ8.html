That must have been the case here.  All involved, including Bogart himself, had reputations for being somewhat persnickety to deal with.  Here, though, they seem to mesh and groove together with incredible fluidity.  In a book written about this film, they actually had a rip-roaring good time with one another between takes...and it comes through in the finished film.<br /><br />Of course, we start off basing this movie on one of the greatest detective stories of all time.  Dashiell Hammett's book was criticized in its day for being too complex and hard to follow.  Well, judge for yourself.  I'm always intrigued to show this movie to someone who's never heard of it or the book on which the film was based, and see whether they have trouble following the plotlines.  I'd guess that 8 out of 10 can do it without much difficulty.<br /><br />There is a setpiece in the book which did not make it into the film.  Since the film follows the book's plotline quite strictly, this omission is a little unusual (although it must be conceded that it added nothing to moving the plot along).  Hammett has Spade telling the story of a man named Flitcraft who disappears.  His family hires Spade and Archer to track him down, and they find him in another city.  As Hammett tells the story, Spade is completely engrossed in telling this story and, in context, it explains so much of why Sam acts the way he does in this tale.<br /><br />Every time I see this movie I imagine Humphrey Bogart, acting what became the hallmark and defining role of his career, delivering this soliloquy to Bridget O'Shaughnessey.<br /><br />But then, in the 1940s. they did not have DVDs, nor did they have any idea of what a "Director's Cut" would be.<br /><br />If you've never seen this wonderful movie, pop it in, relax and enjoy one of the best stories ever put on film.</p></body></html>

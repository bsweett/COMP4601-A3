<meta name="summary" content="A Superb Drama That Is As Intelligent As It Is Thrilling"></head><body><p>MOVIE: Do you know what you're doing right now? Do you know where you're gonna be in 10 minutes, 10 months, 10 years? Do you live in the past, present, or future? This is the focus of Michael Mann's new suspense drama. A taxi cab driver named Max tries to focus on where he's headed rather than where he is right now, which is a dead end job driving a taxi. In the blink of an eye his life becomes a toy. A contract killer chooses his cab out of the 4,000 cabs in L.A County. Now Max is involved in something he doesn't want. He immediately has gone from living in the future (thinking of how one day he's going to make it big) to living in the present (thinking of how he will survive till daylight). The film is filled with a lot of meaningful dialogue and it's meaningful because its true. Vincent (Cruise) brings up the topic of a man who died on the subway and his body was on the train all day before anybody even noticed he was dead. This brings up the point of "what can you do to make a difference". There are 6 billion people in the world, what makes you different? How can you stand out of society and not just be another cab driver, another fast food employee. Now that's that part of the movie. The other part is a well-paced intense film that will grip you and won't let go. Michael Mann knows how to make a movie but in the past his films have been rather slow-paced and even boring at times even though they have a lot of depth and meaning. Collateral is neither slow-paced nor fast-paced, it's well-paced. The last half hour will have you're heart pounding and your body snug in your seat just trying to anticipate what might happen in the next 2, 4, 6 minutes. This movie was really intense and very well made. You know that this could have been a disaster of a movie, but with so many veterans on board they turned it into something very good, very good indeed.<br /><br />ACTING: The acting here was top notch, very good. But it's really the writer you have to credit here. The dialogue is where the emotion is evoked from the audience. Every word that the characters say has meaning but the actors deliver it the way it's supposed to be. Tom Cruise was excellent, a very haunting role for the audience to watch. He's not just a killer, he's a thinker. He knows what he's doing and even though he's the bad guy, he is a smart one. I am not a fan of Jamie Foxx's work but if he does more films like this then my opinion on him will surely change. A great cast that delivered a superbly written movie.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: There are times in the movie where Jamie Foxx could have escaped and ended it all, but you can counter that by saying he became emotionally involved. The movie is a near perfect suspense drama. This is not some stupid hijacking movie with stupid dialogue and fast car chases. If you know Michael Mann's work then you know you can expect something good, and even if this is your first Michael Mann movie you will enjoy this dark themed drama. When you live in the present you gotta "roll with it".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Almost a documentary.."></head><body><p>Roll back the 70s: a teenaged reporter who writes reviews for  underground rock-mag Creem gets a sudden break when he's employed by big-league-mag Rolling Stone to go on the road with up and coming Stillwater and deliver a report on them.<br />  During a wild 3 weeks on the road he (and we) sees the inside of rock n' roll of that era. All the elements are there. The 70's looks and attires, the drugs, the music (original songs written among others by P.Frampton and Cameron Crowe), the teeny "rebellions", the inner band strifes,the groupies and the developing rock industry, the then societal pulse, and the overall atmosphere set by the film's main characters, most notably the teen-reporter, star-groupie Penny Lane and of course the band members and last but not least the boy's "crypto-conservative" desperately-trying-to-be-progressive mother.<br />  "Almost famous" is a brilliant film. Before you can even begin to care whether what the film depicts is accurate, you find yourself laughing endlessly, and being "sucked-in" by a story that at times has semi-documentary touches (makes sense, as the story is a semi-biographical account of Cameron Crowe's) and loving the main characters (all charismatic in their own sense).<br />  The film's main "weapon" is its superb humor. I dont merely mean one-liners but the overall feeling it has, you dont only laugh but this movie tends to have a feel-good sense all over it as well. It's supposed to, right? After all, this is the 70s when everything still had a "purpose" or when things seemed to be more upbeat (compare with the prozac ridden 90s and their "nowhere to go from here" sentiment).<br />  All the actors do a terrific job to make the time machine work here. The mother is great in portaying a representative of the mothers generation that first perceived music as an "enemy" and as a gateway to drugs and (oh my god) wild sex. The band members are going from cool to uncool all the time (as real band members very often do) as they try to act like rock stars ("make us look cool, man") and at the same time try to maintain their human nature (...). The teeny reporter (in my opinion the least convincing of the lot) is decent too while the show is stolen by the enigmatic and pivotal character of groupie Penny Lane. She's is the one character that the others actually revolve around like satellites whether they realise it or not and also serves as a solid reminder of that period as well ( or maybe, not only of that period, in fact, why is rock music being mostly made if not to be "cool and get chicks")..<br />  The dialogue is great, the directing is great, the actors do a great job. Anything missing from Almost Famous to keep it from being a classic?? I would think not, but: because of the way this film works and of its very nature ppl will tend to see it as somewhat of a documentary. Is it? Tough question that one.<br />  The rock era of the 70s wasnt a monodimensional one. It wasn't only about bands that were Led Zepellin lookalikes and people who  were constantly professing "it's all happening man", and above all things were not always that lighthearted. In fact, a lot of people back then thought that there was a musical revolution going on which was going to -in turn- bring about an overall change of things. Ask anyone who's over 45 whether the music of that era did bring about a revolution and get prepared for some really long discussions with very differing conclusions.  Inotherwords, there were very many people around back then who took the whole thing very VERY seriously. Perhaps that is -epidermically- depicted by the rock critic in the film.<br />  It would be unfair though to criticize the film on that premise. After all you cant expect a film to fit in all that in 2 hours. And even if it somehow had done that it could've very easily been boring albeit more accurate.<br />  The fact of the matter is that "Almost Famous" is a wonderful film in very many respects. It goes from hilariously funny to touching with its dripping nostalgia. And yes it does have this "things were better and purer back then" feeling to it, but in the end the way people perceive the times they live in depend on very many different factors.<br />  I've seen this movie twice already and loved it both times and i hardly see how anyone could not love it actually no matter what other thoughts are to be had on the side.<br />  Almost famous is almost perfect</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="this movie is cool.once again the critics are wrong!"></head><body><p>this movie is about adam sandler putting together a prisoner football team to play against the guards.well you know how regular football players look scary?theyd crap themselves if they saw adams team!its an all star cast including nelly,adam sandler,burt reynolds,bill goldberg,stone cold steve austin and a few more.adam sandler plays a cool guy not a aggravated mentaly handicapped guy with a speech impediment like he normaly does. it was a refreshing change.its one of my favorite adam sdandler movies with little nicky,happy gilmore and shakes the clown.theres a lot of bone crunching action.its really severe.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i effin loved it!id like to have seen more stone cold and goldberg but oh well.it was really good all the same.also in this one are kevin nash and the great khali.</p></body></html>

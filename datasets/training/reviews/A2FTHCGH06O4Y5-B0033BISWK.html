Housing the aliens wouldn't have been a hassle!  For something like that, countries would be vying to host them -- for research purposes, if nothing else.  The UN would probably have to maintain a waiting list.<br />1.  How are you gonna fit 1.5 million creatures in that ship?<br />2.  Civilizations in which when the leader dies, the masses are helpless and directionless are not civilizations that perfect interstellar travel.<br />3.  The ship wouldn't have flown at the end!  It had been there for like 20 years!  Human engineers would have torn that thing apart by then!<br />4.  Humans would have been able to activate the aliens' weapons by using their severed limbs.<br /><br />So literally the movie is impossible to swallow.  This leaves us with its allegorical meanings.<br /><br />This, also, was repugnant.  Not for a second could I buy the filmmakers' heavy-handed metaphor of the aliens as refugees.  Are they trying to say the prejudice against aliens is analogous to the prejudice against immigrants in our own society?  If so, they could have done a much better job showing how the fear of aliens might have some rational underpinnings.  As it was, it was as if the humans' fear and hatred of the aliens was completely baseless.  If we had been told that the aliens had had, say, some equivalent to Koran 47:3, then the movie wouldn't have struck me as so simplistically one-sided.</p></body></html>

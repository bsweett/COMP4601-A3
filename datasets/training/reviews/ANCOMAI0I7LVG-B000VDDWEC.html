<meta name="summary" content="More haunting than outright scary; a film that lingers in the pit of your soul..."></head><body><p>When I first saw `28 Days Later' I abhorred it.  I really and truly thought it was horrible.  It was not what I expected to see and for the most part was not what I wanted to see.  Then I watched it again because some friends were dying to see it, and knowing what I was getting myself into I actually found myself engaged with the film.  So I decided to watch it a third time and I was completely smitten with this utterly brilliant horror film.<br /><br />Why the change of heart, drastic change at that?<br /><br />Not ever really getting into the horror genre until recent years my mind had been dulled to the films of today with their big budgets and special effects and `28 Days Later' is no where near that type of film.  It's frantically paced, grittily filmed and ultimately much darker than anything released as of late.  The rawness of the films orchestration feels awkward at first, almost unfinished, but the truth of the mater is that it is the most accomplished horror film in the past decade, maybe longer.  It's smart because it plays on the audience and builds a solid foundation of fear cloaked in deep-seated human emotion.  The audience is constantly on the edge of their seat waiting for the worst to happen and when it comes we are leveled completely by the force.  It took multiple viewings for me to fully appreciate this film, but it is one of those movies that gets better with each and every viewing.<br /><br />The film follows a group of sole survivors of an outbreak that has turned humanity into blood thirsty zombies.  As the group searches for a sanctuary they find that it is not just the undead they must be careful of, but that humans in general tend to unleash their dark side when despair and hopelessness take over.  The film carries a far more real feeling to it with the detail of the main characters.  These `survivors' are just normal everyday individuals.  There's no he-man heroics here, no femme fatales, just your next door neighbor, his father, best friend or worse yet, you.  It helps give the film a far eerier presence because you never know what is going to happen to those involved since they seem so unprepared for what's in front of them.<br /><br />The acting is superb here, especially for that of a horror film.  Breakout star Cillian Murphy shows that he has the acting chops to go far in this industry, and recent years have only gone to further prove this.  The beautiful Naomi Harris also sizzles here with determination and a purely commanding presence.  I can't wait to see her sink her teeth into some more meaty material.  Brendan Gleeson is always worth the price of admission and this is no exception.<br /><br />The true star here though is director Danny Boyle who creates a mood and establishes a fear that not too many directors in this genre seem to get and or understand.  Aside from Boyle I have yet to see a director truly create the perfect horror film.  `28 Days Later' is the perfect horror film.  It will haunt you long afterward and the images presented will take you to a place most horror films fail to take you.  I feel it's because of its sheer genius that one may at first be put off.  It's different than the trashy horror films we have gotten ourselves used to.  Give it a second or even third chance and I promise you will see the brilliance that lay beneath its gritty exterior.  `28 Days Later' is truly one of the best films to grace the screen in a long time, in any genre.</p></body></html>

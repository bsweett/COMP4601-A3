Two brilliant magicians face to face, one each another trying to show the world who's the best. Each own has his secrets and this growing rivalry will lead to unsuspected levels of tension and suspense.<br /><br />This formidable movie presents to Christian Bale (Alfred Bordem) (an actor who has gained gradual status) and Hugh Jackman (Robert Angier) are the contenders. Scarlet Johanson is a smart device among them and Michael Caine like the smart engineer conform a team hard to improve in this extraordinary and original film who will engage you from start to finish.<br /><br />Because at the end of the projection this portrait is also the magic of cinema.  You and me love to be cheated.  The special effects are just illusion; part of the pledge and the transformation.<br /><br />Watch it carefully!</p></body></html>

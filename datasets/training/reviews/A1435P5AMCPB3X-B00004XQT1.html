<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie, excellent twist on a serial killer movie"></head><body><p>This movie adaptation of the classic Bret Easton Ellis book is a very cool take on American culter in the 80's, and on serial killers.  Funny, at times scary, and full of thrills and a twist, this movie has it all.  Christian Bale was excellent and with good reason made this a breakthrough role for him.  If you liked "Less Than Zero" and "Rules Of Attraction" (all Ellis books/films), you will like this movie.  Who knew that the awful fashions of the 80's and the arrogance of wall street could bring so much dark humor.  Worth any price you pay to see this.<br /><br />P.S.  Heuey Lewis and the News did hit their stride by the time they reach their pinicle album "Sports".  The music of this film is just excellent, nostalgic, good memories.</p></body></html>

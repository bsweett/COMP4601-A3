<meta name="summary" content="Lee's Most Cohesive Film"></head><body><p>I have seen most of Spike Lee's previous films, admiring some more than others. To me, he resembles the proverbial little girl with the curl. That said, I think his Inside Man is very, very good in most respects. Four compelling screen actors so thoroughly inhabit the characters entrusted to them that -- as with Jamie Foxx in Ray and Philip Seymour Hoffman in Capote -- they are the characters whom they portray. I was intrigued by the lively interaction between and among Detective Keith Frazier, Madeline White, Dalton Russell, and Arthur Chase rather than recognizing Washington, Foster, Owen, and Plummer at work. One Star for that. I also admire Lee's juxtaposition of  volatile plot developments with moments of quiet, almost lyrical reflection. Another Star for pace. And praise, also,  to the cinematographer (Matthew J. Libatque), the composer of the score (Terence Blanchard), and especially the screenwriter Russell Gewitz) for collaborating so effectively with Lee to integrate image, sound, and dialogue from beginning to end. That's Three Stars so far.<br /><br />Add another for a meticulously planned bank robbery which Lee develops smoothly but unhurriedly within a multi-dimensional plot featuring the robbery itself as well as high-level power brokering within and beyond the NYPD and even City Hall. Lee and Gewitz share the credit for this. Others who have reviewed this film cite similarities with other films such as Dog Day Afternoon and there are a few but make no mistake about it: Inside Man is in no way derivative of any others. I think it is unique, albeit comparable with L.A. Confidential, Heat, and Pulp Fiction in terms of its brilliant examination of cultural ambiguities.<br /><br />As for the last Star, whether or not those who see this film share Lee's perspectives on race relations, whether or not they share his social values, I suggest that he is wholly consistent with those perspectives and values while exploring in this film a multiple of interpersonal relationships which include but are not --ultimately -- defined by racial issues. In fact, racial issues are subordinate to the narrative which he so carefully develops. The situation initially seems to be a crisis with life-or-death implications for the hostages as well as for those committed to rescuing them. By the end of this film, however, we realize that Lee's primary purpose is to tell an entertaining, at times compelling story rather than to exploit the on-going drama as a means by which to express a polemic.<br /><br />Well-done.</p></body></html>

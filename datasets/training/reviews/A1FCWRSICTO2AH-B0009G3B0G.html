I hope this isn't a trend.  Fortunately The Jacket is a much better movie, elevated by some fine acting from Adrian Brody (not to mention a great supporting cast). That's not to say the movie doesn't have problems, but I'm not sure if this is a weakness -- or just the story itself. Fragmented telling in film is always a high-wire act. On the page, it may read well, but in a film if you don't do it right, you lose the audience pretty quickly. That doesn't happen in The Jacket, since Brody's performance is the glue that holds the (past and present) pieces together. So much so that the feel-good ending, which runs the risk of selling out, actually works. If you liked the Sixth Sense (though I wouldn't call The Jacket a supernatural film) , you should like The Jacket.  Not a great movie, but certainly not a bad one.</p></body></html>

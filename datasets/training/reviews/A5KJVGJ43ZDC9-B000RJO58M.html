The quips and puns fly at 100 miles an hour here, it'd probably take three viewings to catch all of it. The film's central joke may get lost on some American viewers-this is a vicious dig at provincial rural locales in England and how petty and nasty their citizens can be.<br /><br />I can't say enough about how clever this film is. Even the camerawork and cuts make you laugh because you know you've seen this type of stuff done with utmost earnestness in action/cop films-the swooshing of a gun into a holster, the click of a gun belt, the shifting of gears in a tense chase,that look of fierce determination on the hero's face as he prepares to get even-it's all done completely over the top and it works. Sergeant Angel is baaaaadassss.<br /><br />My next door neighbor said it "starts out slow". What this means is that people talked alot. The lines are nonstop jokes and I guess nothing went kaboom for a little while. But there's even fun for the dimwitted here, with lots of gory death scenes and interesting weaponry being used. Wright and Pegg still love the horror genre, and somehow managed to graft that into Hot Fuzz as well.<br /><br />I'd say this is like a Tarantino film or a Kevin Smith film. Not that I'm comparing the two. What I mean is that if you love movies as much as these people do...well, if you do, you already saw Hot Fuzz, didn't you? But anyway, if you think you love film, take this flick close to your heart. I would so use this as a litmus test for friends.</p></body></html>

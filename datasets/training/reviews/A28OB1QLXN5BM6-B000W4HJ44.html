I just wanted to sing and dance along throughout the entire film.  (And, to the consternation and mortification of my children, I DID!!!)<br /><br />The cast commits 250% to their roles, and all have a full out good time, which carries right on through to the audience.  Nikki Blonsky, Amanda Bynes, Queen Latifah, John Travolta, Christopher Walken, Michelle Pfeiffer, Brittany Snow, Zac Efron, James Marsden, and Elijah Kelly are all triple threats in this wonderful, feel good film.  The dancing, singing, and acting are all excellent.<br /><br />The heart and soul of this perky film are the simply outstanding production numbers.  The clever choreography is fun and peppy, and the highly enjoyable songs are finger-snapping good (you end up humming them for days).  The pacing is perfect from beginning to end; you are immediately hooked, and they just reel you right in.<br /><br />Overall, this is a happy movie where the girl gets the boy, and everybody sings.  A good, old fashioned musical.  You will be singing and dancing in no time.  What fun!</p></body></html>

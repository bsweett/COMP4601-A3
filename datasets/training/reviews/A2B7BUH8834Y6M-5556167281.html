<meta name="summary" content="A DVD review"></head><body><p>This is a 5-star movie crammed into a 1-star DVD. If you're renting a movie, you only plan on seeing it once... when you buy a movie, you have bought the right to see it whenever you please for as long as you want.  This DVD has FORCED COMMERCIALS! You can not skip them and you are forced to fast-forward through them.  Instead of endearing you to the movies featured in the trailers, you eventually get so mad that the thought of those films makes your blood boil... especially if you already have purchased those films on DVD and you don't need to be coerced into buying them in the first place.<p>There is no excuse for this. Disney should offer refunds and/or replacement discs to those who purchased them on good faith.<p>In addition to the forced commercials, the tech specs are misleading and plain wrong. While the film is widescreen, it is NOT anamorphic as is claimed... this means that while it is in letterbox format, it is not in proper proportion and the images are slightly distorted.<p>Just throwing a movie on a round disk does not a DVD make and this is proof. <p>The movie is fantastic despite these shortcomings... but as the title of this review states - this is a DVD review, not the film. I'd advise waiting until a collector's edition comes out. A collector's edition is likely to contain more features such as interviews with the cast, out-takes and scenes from the Oscars for that year... and (one can only pray) no forced commercials.</p></body></html>

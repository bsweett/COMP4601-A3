<meta name="summary" content="Too much wincing, mistakes, and deviations"></head><body><p>If you like action fantasies, Eragon (the movie) has action, and it is a fantasy.<br /><br />This review goes down from there.<br /><br />Eragon (the movie) deviates in many significant ways from Eragon (the book).  From the story line, to the character interactions, to the personalities of the characters, if you have any positive thoughts about the book (and I did), you will wince, wince, wince.  And the movie mistakes!  Here a horse, there TWO horses; here no bow and arrows... now where did THEY come from!  The dragon and her rider are the fastest routes to the castle... so how exactly did Brom, on a horse, get there in the nick of time?<br /><br />Brrrr.<br /><br />With the criticism of the book of the borrowed story line and characters of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, et cetera, I was its defender.  Eragon (the book) was still entertaining and a yarn worthy of being told.  But Eragon (the movie) tried its hardest to MAKE the viewer realize the similarities between those other stories and this one (except for a couple of things... have you ever envisioned a dwarf or an elf that looked LESS like a "dwarf" or an "elf"?  And what about an evil dragonrider/king that sat around speaking softly and tried, very unsuccessfully, to appear totally ruthless?).<br /><br />My son says "it was terrible because it did not follow the book in the most important ways, and it was very, very cheesy."  And that's from a kid who's read the book at least 6 times!<br /><br />'Nuff said.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another disappointing and boring "epic" film"></head><body><p>Since I'm interested in the Crusades and was excited when I heard about this film coming out, perhaps my expectations were a bit too high, for this film failed to excite me as I watched it. I didn't feel any strong identity with any of the characters and the story wasn't compelling enough to keep me interested. In the end, it seemed like a colossal waste of money, people's time and talents, and the effort that went into the making of this film. Because it bombed at the box office, it ruins the chance for any future Crusades movie from being made any time soon.<br /><br />As far as "sword and sandal epics" go, "Gladiator" remains the best one that has come out so far, followed by "Alexander" (which I was pleasantly surprised by that it wasn't as bad as people made it out to be), and "Troy". I'm about epic-out though, as nothing really compares to "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy. This film would have been better to skimped out on the battle sequences (which I suspect most movie goers are tired of) and focused on the political and religious intrigue behind the fight for Jerusalem during the Crusades.<br /><br />Save your money and time by avoiding this movie. Invest in a good history book about the Crusades and let your imagination run wild. Chances are likely it will be vastly superior to this disappointment of a film.</p></body></html>

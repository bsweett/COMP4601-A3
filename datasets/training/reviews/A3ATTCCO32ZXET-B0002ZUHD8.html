<meta name="summary" content="This legend just didn't live up to itself"></head><body><p>This movie was yet another retelling of the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.  It had an unusual angle to the familiar story, and a lot of potential that I believe it just didn't live up to.  But wait, isn't this a kind of foolproof, proven winner?  Well...<p>What I liked:<br />it was a grittier, more historically plausible interpretation of the King Arthur legend than anything filmed before.  The chaos of the battle scenes was nicely done.  There was nothing mystical or magical mixed up in there.  The main characters were very flawed humans with their own stories:  Merlin was a prominent leader, perhaps a Druid, but not a wizard; Arthur was a conflicted half-British, half-Roman noble who learned egalitarian values and cared deeply for his pagan comrades; and all the knights of the Round Table were foreign men eager to leave the service of the Roman Empire once their 15 year tour of duty was up.  I was able to appreciate the care that went into researching the likely historical setup for the tale of these renowned "heroes".<p>What I disliked:<br />First, there were logistical flaws like wimpy people pulling bows that had 120 lb draw weights, weapons from inconsistent historical periods and countries, the overly done "tough Amazon warrior princess" typing done with Guinevere (it was laughably implausible).  That's enough to bother some people, but I can get over that sort of thing if the rest of a movie is pulled off well.  <p>Sadly, King Arthur wasn't pulled off that well overall, and I think it was a problem with the basic story being a bit underwhelming.  The biggest (meaning, what took up most of the screenplay) task that these men faced involved not the fate of the nation nor the defeat of great evil, but protecting a small village from a band of marauding Saxons.  I just had a hard time caring.  You know a film is in trouble when the director has to rely so heavily on the music to convince the audience that there's deep emotion to a scene.  Yes, that score was swelling heavily and often, but somehow, I just didn't connect on the visceral level with the dilemmas of Arthur and his knights, or the plight of the oppressed common folk that they were shepherding to Hadrian's Wall. The Arthur/Guinivere/Lancelot romance was halfhearted.  Even the "sad" parts involving deaths of good guys didn't grab me, and I normally choke up.  I kept wondering, what's missing -- why can't I lose myself in this story?  <p>So this is a valuable lesson to all future filmmakers that may wish to tackle this subject. Perhaps the Arthurian legend does need magic and mystery to carry it successfully on the big screen - after all, if you're going to take on a larger-than-life tradition, your scope had better be larger than life.  Otherwise, why bother?  You could any number of other documented military campaigns instead.  Too much petty realism combined with a too-small plot focus may have been the death of this King Arthur movie.<p>-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></body></html>

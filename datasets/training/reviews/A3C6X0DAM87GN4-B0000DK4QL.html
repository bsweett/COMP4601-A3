<meta name="summary" content="I "Dare" You To Enjoy This Movie!"></head><body><p>To be honest I'm getting a little sick of these comic book movies, and the worst part is my friends don't care so I'm constantly being dragged to see these bad movies. <p> If movies like "X-Men", "Spider-Man", & "Daredevil" had been released 10-12 years ago I would be having a blast at the movies, but that's not the case. And I'm not interested in comics anymore, and I don't remember the story-lines concerning the characters.<p> One of the many reasons I didn't like "Spider-Man" was because I didn't feel Toby Maguire was a good choice for the lead. I don't think of him as a heroic leading man type, Affleck on the other hand is liked by the ladies so he stands more of a chance at pulling off the role despite the fact he has no talent as an actor. And in all honestly I could of liked this movie more than "Spider-Man" or "X-Men", but, here's why I didn't.<p> First of all Affleck seems a bit to smug to me in this movie. He acts too much like a know it all. I didn't like his interruptation of the character. My second problem acting wise has to do with the "Bullseye" character played by Colin Farrell. A person I think has been OVER-used in Hollywood in just a short amount of time. Already in the past year has has appeared in "Minority Report" (Which is a good movie) and "The Recruit" (Another good movie) but here he plays "Bullseye" like a vilgilante gang member. Not at all what I was expecting this character to be like. I pictured the character to clearly be evil a little disturbed, but, smart, slick, sneaky and sly as a fox. Colin Farrell plays him like yes he's evil, insane, and a biker. Totally a wrong choice. But who's to blame? Farrell or the director? Also, I can't understand why Michael Clarke Duncan was chosen in his part. It all seemed wrong.<p> I did some reading when I went home about the daredevil character. I read my old marvel comic trading cards and read that daredevil and Elektra (played by Jennifer Garner) meet while in college. Which doesn't happen in this movie. I also never read anything about daredevil's dad being a boxing, but, that may just be my fault. Going back to Garner though, she just isn't given a good role. Infact no one really is well written in this movie. And Garner doesn't really make the character believeable. <p> I have one question for everyone, this was never explained in the movie, why does "Daredevil" sleep in water? That confused me.<p> For those who liked "Spider-Man" and "X-Men" I really doubt you'll be coming out of "Daredevil" enjoying it. It's a film I think so far, is one of the worst of the year (and I'm sure that opinion will stick).<p> Bottom-line: A silly poorly written comic book movie that didn't seem to bring it's characters to life, the way "Spider-Man" did. We really don't believe in what we're seeing. A missed chance at what could of been a good movie.</p></body></html>

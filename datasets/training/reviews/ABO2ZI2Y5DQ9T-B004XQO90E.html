<meta name="summary" content="Reliving Last Eight Minutes of Someone Else's Life"></head><body><p>Duncan Jones' "Source Code" is a taut sci-fi thriller, of which intriguing premise may remind us of a 1993 movie "Groundhog Day." Jake Gyllenhaal is Colter Stevens, a military helicopter pilot, who is given a near impossible task to find out the terrorist responsible for the recent train bombing in Chicago.<br /><br />Assuming the identity of a victim on the doomed train, Colter is sent back to "relive" the eight minutes before the bomb goes off. Like Bill Murray's hapless protagonist, Colter is forced to live the same eight minutes again and again by Jenkins (Vera Farmiga) and Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright), who are desperate to know who the terrorist is.<br /><br />Despite the time-loop concept the entire film is based on, director Duncan Jones employs a simple narrative style to focus the characters and their interactions. The result is a surprisingly emotional conclusion (like Jones' previous thriller "Moon"), in which the protagonist Colter has to face the inevitable.<br /><br />As an action thriller "Source Code" is fast-paced and slick, but perhaps some viewers might feel the idea of reliving the same eight minutes is underdeveloped. The reaction is understandable, but the film is not just about the process of detecting the terrorist (which is considerably suspenseful), but about the change that happens in the hero, who comes to see those strangers on the train as humans with feelings and stories. On that score the film delivers.</p></body></html>

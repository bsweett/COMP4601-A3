Her son, Simon [Roger Princep], seems to be having difficulty making the adjustment; the number of imaginary friends he has is multiplying. When Simon disappears, however, Laura begins to wonder whether these imaginary friends are truly imaginary. The police give up the search, then her husband, Carlos [Fernando Cayo]. But with the help of a psychic, Laura continues the search, enlisting the help of his friends, who she believes are ghosts. As the psychic says, it's not that you see to believe, you must believe to see. Laura must have faith if she is to find her son.<br /><br />The Orphanage is a beautiful tale of love and faith, and the magic of believing. If you don't believe in ghosts by the time this picture ends, well, I feel sorry for you.</p></body></html>

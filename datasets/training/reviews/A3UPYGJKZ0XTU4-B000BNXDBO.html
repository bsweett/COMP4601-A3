<meta name="summary" content="Stoner Comedy that Has Its Moments, but Mediocre Overall."></head><body><p>"Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle" is a stoner comedy that tries to distinguish itself with ethnic lead characters instead of being a typical white guy buddy picture. Harold (John Cho) is a Korean investment banker frustrated with his job. And Kumar (Kal Penn) will do anything to avoid going to medical school, as his parents expect. They are recent college graduates and roommates whose idea of a good time is watching tv while getting high. One evening while doing just that, Harold and Kumar get a craving for White Castle burgers. So, stoned out of their minds, the pair set out in search of pot, women, and an elusive White Castle restaurant.<br /><br />A more descriptive, but no less blunt, title for the movie might be "Vulgar Adventures on the Way to White Castle". The humor here is low-brow, scatological, literally "potty humor". Harold and Kumar are a couple of stoned, socially unsophisticated young men. There are some laugh-out-loud moments, but I think the comedy is undermined by the guys' more preposterous escapades. A couple of stoners taking the most indirect route possible in an obsessive pursuit of hamburgers is funny without turning it into a circus sideshow. Funnier, in fact. As stoner comedies go, this one just doesn't rate very high. I recommend 1999's superb film "Go" as an example of how funny and frustrating a quest for recreational pharmaceuticals can be.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include 4 featurettes, 3 audio commentaries, 8 deleted/alternate scenes plus outtakes, 2 theatrical trailers, a music video for "Yeah (Dream of Me) by All Too Much, and a DVD-ROM (Windows only). "John Cho and Kal Penn: The Backseat Interview" (12 minutes) is an interview of the two lead actors by comedian Bobby Lee, who has a small part in the film. They talk about various scenes in the movie while driving around Los Angeles in an SUV in the rain. "The Art of the Fart" (10 minutes) is about creating the sound for the bathroom competition between the 2 English coeds. Includes interviews with director Danny Leiner and Sound Designer Jeff Kushner. "Cast and Crew: Drive-Thru Bites" is a series of short interviews with director Danny Leiner, the actresses who play the "diarrhea twins", one of the extreme sports punk actors, the neighboring roommates, writers Hurwitz and Schlossberg, actor Fred Willard, actor Neil Patrick Harris, and  Paula Garces, who plays Maria. "A Trip to the Land of Burgers" (10 minutes) is about creating the film's single animated sequence, Harold's dream. One of the theatrical trailers is approved for all audiences by the MPAA; the other is rated R.<br /><br />The first audio commentary is by director Danny Leiner and actors John Cho and Kal Penn. Leiner talks about decisions and difficulties in making the film, and Cho and Penn talk about their on-set experiences. The second audio commentary is by writers Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, accompanied by their friend, Harold Lee, who was the inspiration for the movie's Harold character. Hurwitz and Schlossberg were roommates and wrote the film about characters like themselves and their friends. They discuss writing and storytelling decisions, casting, and their experiences on the set during filming and in getting the movie made. Theirs is the most interesting of the audio commentaries. The third audio commentary is an "Extreme" commentary by actor Danny Bochart, who played one of the extreme sports punks. It's a rambling but good-natured commentary on how he got the role and about the movie. Bochart is a skateboarder in Toronto with no prior film experience, who was cast much to his own surprise.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Agonizing Suspense in an Innovative Cinematic Experience..."></head><body><p>The mathematical professor Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is dying as his heart is slowly deteriorating and the only thing that can save him would be a heart transplant.  Meanwhile, Paul's wife is urging him to impregnate her as she wishes for a child with her husband, which brings up some moral dilemmas for the couple.  The rich housewife Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts) is a recovering cocaine addict with a wonderful family that she loves above all as she fills her days with rehab meetings and swimming.  The family man, ex-convict, and former alcoholic Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro) has discovered God and works hard to mend his past failures in the name of the Lord by helping others.  Paul, Christina, and Jack meet at a crossroad that brings them all pain, suffering, and agony as guilt, love, and anger are heavy burdens in their hearts.<br /><br />Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, the man behind the film Amores Perros (2000), brings another riveting tale of three characters whose lives are interconnected and ultimately changed through an dreadful accident.  The film offers the audience reflection upon the grief caused by several emotional states such as love, anger, and guilt, which follows the accident.  Despite the similarities in 21 Grams and Amores Perros, I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu rejuvenates the idea and displays outstanding directorial skills as he offers the audience an innovative cinematic experience.<br /><br />21 Grams is told in a fragmented storyline which encourages the audience to ponder the theme and messages of the film.  This fragmented storyline displays first-class editing as it, at an initial glance, seems erratic and difficult to follow, but as the storyline jumps back and forth it offers small glimpses of recollection that encourages thoughtful interaction with the film.  The cinematography, mise-en-scene, and editing are outstanding as they elevate the emotional turmoil that the characters are experiencing.  All the cinematic aspects of making a film are brought together by I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and he offers the world a brilliant cinematic experience.</p></body></html>

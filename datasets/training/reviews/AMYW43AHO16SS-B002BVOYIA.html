Nick Nolte gives a solid performance as the UN commander who is powerless to stop the bloodshed.  Terry George directs this movie according to detail.  He leaves no stone unturned.  This is an indictment to the world for turing their eyes to this monstrosity.  I hope everyone views this movie with the intention to stop man's inhumanity to man.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good debut for Tarantino, but..."></head><body><p>First of all, I agree with some of the other reviewers with regards to the casting and the editing of the movie. Superb performances by Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Chris Penn and Steve Buscemi. Number two, a nice preparation for what lay ahead with Pulp Fiction, in terms of the editing and playing with the timeline, going back and forth, to tell the story in little pieces, almost ending with the middle of the story.<br /><br />As for the downside: I didn't find the story as compelling as Pulp Fiction's. Sometimes it can be funny, but the violence and the blood in the movie are pointless more than once and they don't contribute quite enough a brilliant storyline. Overall, I found it to be an good debut by Tarantino. As far as I'm concerned, "Pulp Fiction" was his first big break, and the best thing he did until the Kill Bill series.</p></body></html>

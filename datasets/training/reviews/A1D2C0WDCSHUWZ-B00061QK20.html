<meta name="summary" content="A "Hero" is born!"></head><body><p>Despite being billed as being from Quentin Tarantino, Zhang Yimou's "Hero" (original title: "Ying Xiong") is more "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon" than "Kill Bill." Visually rich, stunningly action-packed, and beautifully made, "Hero" is a unique film that takes the soul and senses on a rollercoaster ride.<br /><br />Ancient China (third century B.C.) was divided into seven kingdoms, and the most powerful lord was the King of Qin (Chen Dao Ming). He wants to unite China under his own rule. But he lives in fear of his life, most particularly from a trio of deadly assassins: "Broken Sword", "Flying Snow" and "Long Sky" (Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, Donnie Yen).<br /><br />Then a man called Nameless (Jet Li) arrives, announcing that he has somehow killed them. How could he have killed three incredibly powerful warriors? Not just by his impressive martial arts skills, but through his cunning as well. He uses jealousy, calligraphy, and his wits to defeat them. But the king is not convinced that Nameless is telling the whole truth, and concocts a version of his own. A game of wits starts to form between the mysterious warrior and the wily king. What is the truth behind Hero's story?<br /><br />"Hero" follows in the footsteps of "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon." And while it doesn't cover much new ground in the fantasy martial arts area, it's a magnificent and awe-inspiring film. But despite all the wire-fu, "Hero" dips into an area that "Crouching Tiger" didn't -- it draws heavily on Akira Kurosawa's classic "Rashomon," by giving us different versions of the same story. What is the truth? That is left blurred, and eventually the people who tell the stories are more important than the truth.<br /><br />Zhang Yimou creates a film where style overcomes the realistic, full of color and scenery and beauty. People slash off hundreds of oncoming arrows and leap through walls of droplets -- just try doing that in the real world. The fight scenes are, simply put, balletic. They fight while suspended over a lake as their swords dip through the water, fight to music, battle in a swirl of fallen leaves. But none of this jars the viewer if they remember that in this film, the style and beauty of the action is what makes it effective.<br /><br />Jet Li and Chen Dao Ming give the best performances of this film -- they both portray intelligent, suspicious men who are playing a strange game of truth and deception. Their back-and-forth conversations are entrancing. The three assassin actors, as well as the wonderful Zhang Ziyi, are given secondary roles, but do an excellent job of imbuing them with little hints of humanity.<br /><br />Zhang Yimou's first foray into the martial arts genre is a roaring success. It lacks the freshness of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," but it stands firmly on its own feet with a beautifully intricate story and amazing action scenes. A must-see.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another masterpiece from Ron Howard"></head><body><p>Following up on the box office success of The Da Vinci Code, Ron Howard's adaptation of Dan Brown's book is a great movie in a year of great movies.  With Tom Hanks returning as Professor Langdon, the movie also features the beautiful Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer in probably her biggest role so far.  This time around, our scientist hero, Dr. Langon, is running around Rome trying to find four kidnapped cardinals and a bomb before midnight.  Not quite like the TV show "24", but close in its fast paced action interspersed with good dialogue.  The key of the movie is the hidden motives of multiple characters, and how they are not revealed until the very end of the movie.  The film's location is great, and authentic as this reviewer has visited many of the locations in Rome that featured in the movie.  The language is also good, as the locals talk in Italian, and when speaking English, do so with Italian accents.  All in all, one of the better movies of 2009.  It would surely have done better at the box office if not for the proximate releases of other blockbusters such as X-Men Origins two weeks before, Star Trek a week before, and Up 2 weeks after the May 15th opening date of Angels and Demons.</p></body></html>

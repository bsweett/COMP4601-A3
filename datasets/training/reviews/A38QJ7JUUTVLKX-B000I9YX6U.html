<meta name="summary" content="CHILLING!!!"></head><body><p>This is TRUE HORROR. This is a psychological horror film, wich means it plays with your mind rather than show you creepy visuals. Yes this film does have some creepy visuals (especially the dream sequences), but it makes the viewer use their minds in order to scare them. You do have to pay attention to this film, or nothing in here will scare you. The truly chilling part of the movie is it's powerful soundtrack, without that this wouldn't have been any good. Another scary aspect of this film is that this could actually happen. In other words, this is real. This is one you must see alone in the dark.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Blood flows and heads roll...all in good fun."></head><body><p>Horror movies experienced a bit of a rebirth last year, with both "Freddy Vs. Jason" and the remake of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" raking in loads at the box office, and both are now treated to a deluxe special edition DVD, this is something none of the previous "Friday the 13th" or "Nightmare on Elm Street" (outside of the box set) got. The FVJ DVD is loaded with supplements that compliment the movie, which was surprisingly good. <p>You probably already know the story, so I won't waste keystrokes on describing it ad tedium for you. But what I will say is that this is very much the movie that fans have been ravenous for. Director Ronny Yu wanted to make a back-to-basics slasher movie that respected the mythologies of both series, but added some new twists that would bring them together. Considering how movies ventures of this kind turn out, this movie rises above all the dredge that filled the slasher genre since the craze died in the 80s. This is definitely not a movie for the critics, but fans of either series should be satisfied, if for nothing else than the copious amounts of blood spilled on screen. <p>Obviously owing to the box office success of FVJ, the New Line DVD gives a nice package of supplements to go with the movie. Here is a breakdown of what you can look forward to:<p>-Disc one has a nice commentary track featuring Director Ronny Yu, and the two titans themselves, Robert Englund and Ken Kirzinger. Englund is the most vocal, and humorous of the bunch. Kirzinger offers a few tidbits, but is mostly quiet. Yu, in his heavily accented but perfectly understandable English, is the most technically inclined. The commentary track is light on the technical details, but is loads of fun. <p>-There are loads of deleted scenes, but most of them are extended versions of existing scenes in the movie, and are nothing to get excited about. The alternate opening is, again, an extension of the first scene, though it is very classic "Friday the 13th". The alternate ending included is actually pretty good, but I can see why they opted for the other one. <p>-There is a 1 hour documentary sectioned into 10-15 minute featurettes that cover all aspects of the movie. This is where you can find all the technical details that were not in the commentary. They cover the long and grueling road from inception to completion, including bits on the screenwriting, set design, and the stunts. It has interviews with all the principle players, including Sean Cunningham and some of the New Line executives.<p>-The best supplement for me was the reprint of the 2 part Fangoria article on the many scripts and the long road to finding the right story to put to screen. It goes into detail about the many script ideas, and how off-the-wall some of them were. Fascinating stuff.<p>-You also get the assorted trailers, TV spots, and an excruciating music video by Ill Nino. Heard of them? You probably won't be. <p>"Freddy vs. Jason" is a nice homage to both the series and the fans. Since my expectations were not particularly high going into this movie, I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The DVD package from New Line is an easy recommendation for fans, and hopefully this will finally spark some progress into that "Friday the 13th" box set that fans have been eyeballing.</p></body></html>

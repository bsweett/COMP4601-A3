<meta name="summary" content="Great movie now in beautiful HD"></head><body><p>Although this movie is fantastic, sadly it is one of Harrison Ford's last good performances (other than perhaps "Clear and Present Danger" in 1994).  Ford plays Dr. Richard Kimble, a man wrongly accused of killing his wife.  He escapes prison and then sets out to not only avoid recapture, but also prove his innocence.  As good as Ford's performance is, this movie is really carried by Tommy Lee Jones who plays Marshall Samual Gerard.  His humor and intensity are outstanding.  The plot is intriguing with lots of action.  This is the first movie I've had the pleasure to see in the theater, on laserdisc, on DVD, and now on HD DVD.  The HD DVD transfer is quite good and the sound is improved over the DVD version as well.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

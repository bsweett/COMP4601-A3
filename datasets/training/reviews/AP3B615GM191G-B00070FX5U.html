<meta name="summary" content="An Action Movie That Also Bends The Mind"></head><body><p>"Total Recall", at its core, is a straight-up action vehicle for Arnold Schwarzenegger.  At least, that is what it was supposed to be.  However, it actually succeeds so much more as a psychological thriller thanks to director Paul Verhoeven and an incredible script.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Total Recall" follows the very strange set of circumstances surrounding one Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger), who one day is living the married life with Lori (Sharon Stone), and the next moment is caught up in an intrigue plot involving a stunning vixen named Melina (Rachel Ticotin) who tells Quaid he is not exactly what (or who) he thinks he is.  But is the whole thing a virtual-reality experience?<br /><br />This movie succeeds because it manages to successfully indulge in two different genres:<br /><br />-First of all, it is an action/adventure flick on par with Arnie's other works.  It is non-stop from the opening scene, rushing forward with special effects (well, special for the time period...!), chase scenes, and tons of gunfire.<br /><br />-Secondly, though, it is also a psychological mind-bender of the highest order.  You really won't know exactly what is going on until the final scene (and even then the result will amaze you).<br /><br />Overall, then, I was very impressed with this flick that I didn't have very high expectations for.  I expected a simple "action romp", but instead was treated to so much more.  It can be watched for many reasons: the action, the thinking, the acting (actually pretty good), or the nostalgia.  Either way, there will more than likely be something for you.</p></body></html>

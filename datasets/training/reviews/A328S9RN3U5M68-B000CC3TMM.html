And so what does that mean in movieland? If a little is good, a lot is better.  Wrong!  As is often the case with sequels the intial creative bite gets diluted as though success of the original will carry the sequel without much work.  In the case of TRANSPORTER 2 the story and supporting cast border on the ridiculous, but if you're watching the film just to see Jason Statham in action, then you'll be satisfied.<br /><br />The appealing aspect of Transporter 1 was the setting  - the French Riviera that served as a gorgeous background for all the derring-do of a top-notch cast.  Now in Miami, in a role far less interesting than the original plot of Transporter 1, the film strains credibility and that detracts from the thrills.  But the good news is that Jason Statham is intact and as fascinating and dexterous as ever.  You just have to settle for that  (which is a lot) and the movie will satisfy.  Let's hope they don't make Statham consider a T 3.  Grady Harp, January 06</p></body></html>

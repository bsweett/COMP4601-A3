<meta name="summary" content="Flawed, but worthy"></head><body><p>A disillusioned, alcoholic American soldier (Tom Cruise) hires out as a mercenary in Japan to put down the rebellion of a samurai leader (Ken Watanabe), but instead he comes to admire their ways and joins them in their struggle.  This is a deeply flawed film that nevertheless has many fine points to recommend it.  It is a rousing adventure with stirring battle scenes.  The photography, costuming, and production design are astonishing, presenting a convincing and fascinating portrait of samurai culture and Japanese peasant life.  The cast is mostly excellent, especially Watanabe, who should be remembered at Oscar time.<br /><br />However, there are two things that work against this film.  The first is Tom Cruise himself.  Although he does good work here, he just seems to be too lightweight as an actor to grapple convincingly with the issues of guilt and redemption that torment his character.  The biggest problem is the film's ending, which eschews an honest resolution in favor of Hollywood convention.  Nevertheless, the things that work in this film really work well, resulting in a entertaining and worthy feature./</p></body></html>

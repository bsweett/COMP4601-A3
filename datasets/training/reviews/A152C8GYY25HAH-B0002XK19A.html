<meta name="summary" content="A brilliant sequel"></head><body><p>"Spiderman 2" is a marvelous action-adventure, sci-fi thriller which won't please everyone because it emphasizes story over action. There is plenty of action, of course, but much of the movie dwells on the loneliness, alienation and complexity of its hero, Peter Parker/Spiderman. Its premise is that being a hero has its price - a theme which everyone from the ancient Greeks to Shakespeare and beyond has written about. It also employs the idea that greatness is often thrust upon an unwilling participant and plays havoc with such a person's personal life.<br /><br />The movie's screenplay employs the "Gone With the Wind/Titanic" approach. These movies had as much story as action. They were the most successful films of their time.<br /><br />There is -and always has been - a portion of the audience which demands all action all of the time. For these viewers, "Spiderman 2" is a disappointment. It's not in the "Independence Day/Starship Troopers/The Day After Tomorrow" format, in which the characters are cardboard ones who exist only to move the action along.<br /><br />Tobey Macguire reprises his role as Spiderman. He is perfect. Something tells me that Macguire is a bit perplexed by the fact that he has become known as one of the great actors of his generation, much like Spiderman is confused by his powers.<br /><br />This episode finds Parker down on his luck and depressed. There are no great villains for him to fight. He's still madly in love with MJ [Kirsten Dunst] but is afraid to show his feelings because he knows that his enemies could harm her if they knew of his feelings for her. Harry Osborn [James Franco] is remains his best friend but does not know that Parker as Spiderman killed Osborn's mad scientist father in the first movie.  Finally, another madman comes to the rescue - Dock Ork [Alfred Molina], yet another scientist taken hostage by his own overly ambitious science project.<br /><br />Full enjoyment of this sequel requires one to see the original, because so much of the story hinges on knowledge of what happened in the first film.<br /><br />My main criticism of "Spiderman 2" is that the ending is a blatant setup for "Spiderman 3". Otherwise, it's a greatly entertaining endeavor.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Hughes Brothers do it again"></head><body><p>The Hughes's are two of the best African Amercian directors ever to direct. Their last film From Hell displays their talent for horror and suspense with his movie. The film plays it smart by not showing the killer's face till the end and the death's are never shown.Johnny Depp and Heather Graham both give winning performances and this film is very highly reccomned.</p></body></html>

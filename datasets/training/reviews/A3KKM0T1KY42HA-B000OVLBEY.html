<meta name="summary" content="Ghost Rider the Duck"></head><body><p>There are some really good movies that have come out of the Marvel Comic Book stable of titles: The Blade series <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007WFX62">The Blade Trilogy (Blade/ Blade II/ Blade: Trinity)</a>. The Spiderman series <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002XK190">Spider-Man / Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Editions)</a>. The X-Men series <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEVZ9E">X-Men Trilogy (X-Men/ X2: X-Men United/ X-Men: The Last Stand)</a>.<br /><br />And there've been some really crumby ones too: Howard the Duck <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6300185788">Howard the Duck</a>, Elektra <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A9QK96">Elektra - The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>. And now...Ghost Rider.<br /><br />Ghost Rider had its moments of cool special effects. But the movie is ruined by a very slow start (you're 45 minutes into the film before we finally even see Ghost Rider), absolutely horrible melodramatic dialogue, overacting, and completely unrealistic situations.<br /><br />Eva Mendez is the leading lady. Eva was great in 2005's Hitch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000957O82">Hitch (Widescreen Edition)</a>, and this actress clearly has real potential under the right direction; but that potential was lost in Ghost Rider under the direction of Mark Steven Johnson (who also wrote and produced the dismal Elektra back in 2005).<br /><br />Johnson also has the potential to do a better film as he proves with 2003's Daredevil <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002XVQNU">Daredevil (Director's Cut)</a>. But he for whatever reason, deliberate or not, went with the way-over-the-top for Ghost Rider; I found myself uttering, "Yeah, right!" several times at the events and scenarios in Ghost Rider.<br /><br />Nick Cage is Ghost Rider and you'd have to go back to before Mendez was even in her first feature film to see him in a better than average movie (I'm thinking 1997's Face Off <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/630512762X">Face/Off</a> maybe?). Man, this guy gets a lot of work. Unfortunately, when I see his name attached to a film my expectations are for average at best; and there was no surprise with Ghost Rider.<br /><br />Ghost Rider is definitely not one for the DVD collection. If you've got nothing better in your viewing queue, it might be worth a peek when it comes on cable.</p></body></html>

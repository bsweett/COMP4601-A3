<meta name="summary" content="Jack and the Fountain of Youth"></head><body><p>This film is a another very well placed original installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series. There is a nice mix of humor, surprises, tension and adventure all nicely wrapped together.<br /><br />The storyline has been well constructed, and there are numerous twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat, and to ensure that you won't be easily able to guess what is going to happen next.<br /><br />In my opinion, this movie is just about on par with the previous films, so if you liked the other Pirates of the Caribbean movies, you will surely enjoy this one as well.</p></body></html>

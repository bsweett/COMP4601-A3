<meta name="summary" content="Crime Must Be Punished..."></head><body><p>When comic book movies began making their comeback during the last few years, most of the movies were based on very well known characters from Marvel and DC Comics.  After a string of hits, Marvel decided to try their hand at adapting a character that isn't as well known, and in fact had already been adapted miserably in the early 90's, the character is The Punisher.<br /><br />The story for "The Punisher" begins when undercover agent Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) is working on a drug sting, but the sting doesn't go as planned and a few of the criminals die in the process.  This wouldn't be that big of a deal, except for one of the criminals is the son of Howard Saint (John Travolta), the biggest crime boss in Miami.  With the death of his son, Howard, places a hit on Frank Castle and his entire family.  Saint's thugs do as they're told, and assault Frank and his family during a vacation.  After being left for dead, Frank comes to, only to discover that his entire family has been murdered, and that he's badly wounded.  Once on the mend, Frank begins to plot his revenge and deliver his own brand of punishment for Howard Saint and his criminal empire.<br /><br />This movie was quite impressive for a comic book adaptation.  I thought it captured the character of Frank Castle really well.  Easily lets the viewer forget about the dismal "The Punisher" movie featuring Dolph Lungdren in the title role from 1992.  This movie featuring a strong cast, headed by Thomas Jane who does an excellent job capturing the devastation/depression of his family's murder, and channelling those emotions into vengeance.  John Travolta does a very good job playing the villain as usual, and you can tell he's enjoying this role.  The rest of the cast deliver strong supporting roles especially Rebecca Romijn and Ben Foster who bring Frank's eccentric new neighbors to life.<br /><br />The setups for the punishments are done very nicely, Frank is not just picking them off simply by shooting them as one might expect, rather Castle goes through an elaborate setup to take his revenge on the man who murdered his family, Howard Saint.  Nice adaptation of the characters Mr. Bumpo, Spacker Dave, and Joan from the Garth Ennis comics.  The violence is not gratuitous or over the top in the least, all very well done.  The only true complaints I have are very minor, the biggest being that nothing occurs in New York which is where Marvel's characters generally reside, The Punisher among them.  Also, they changed Frank Castle from being a Vietnam Vet into an undercover agent, which is fine I understand artistic license plus you want a young Frank Castle so that one's fine.<br /><br />Overall very well done despite what the critics say about it.  Very few problems, great action scenes, good acting.  Highly recommend if you're in the mood for a good action movie with a plot or just a comic book fan looking for a good adaptation.<br /><br />"The Punisher" is rated R for violence and language.</p></body></html>

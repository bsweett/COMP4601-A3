<meta name="summary" content="This wasn't supposed to be funny.....right?"></head><body><p>Horror and humor walk a very thin and blurry line, don't they?  There are so many unintentionally humorous moments in this film that it's hard to pick just one.  The acting is substandard, the people do stupid things, and the characters are one-dimensional.<br />  The ending is also unsatisfying because it is not made clear that the military is wiping out the creatures and saving everyone everywhere, and we don't know just how far the mist spread.<br /><br />It did get two things right:  1)  when civilization and technology are taken away, people go "Lord of the Flies" on each other--taking sides, choosing scapegoats, and letting fear get the best of them.<br />2)  the existential horror at the very end, when the man discovers that waiting a few more minutes could have saved several lives, is quite disturbing.</p></body></html>

It's part Dungeons and Dragons, part Lord of the Rings and part Star Wars...yes, I said Star Wars.  You have a young apprentice (Luke Skywalker), his mentor (Ben Kenobi), both of whom have magical abilities (the Force) as the Mentor teaches the student to use them, and use them wisely (don't go to the dark side).  We even have a princess and a Han Solo like character who pops up later.<br /><br />But don't let any of that deter you.  It's a classic setup and there is plenty of originality.  The inheritance of the Dragon and the bonding of rider to beast is a very original concept and played out well in the film.  The F/X are spectacular, the scenery and landscape are unspoiled and the pace and dialogue are efficient and well directed.  Jeremy Irons gives a solid and enjoyable performance as the mentor.  John Malcovich, who is only in a few scenes, is good but he doesn't have a lot to do.  Robert Carlyle plays his part creepy and viscious as an evil sorcerer.<br /><br />Overall the movie is very enjoyable and even though it is not terribly original you don't find yourself getting too upset about it.  It plays out more like a tribute to past movies and does so with great respect.</p></body></html>

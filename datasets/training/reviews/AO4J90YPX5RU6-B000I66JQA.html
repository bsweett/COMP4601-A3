<meta name="summary" content="Tragic yet Wonderful"></head><body><p>'THE HOURS" is a beautiful movie made from a well written but ugly story. 3 tragic lives have obvious connections. In the 1920's a woman writes a novel called "Mrs. Dalloway", the author lives a sad life. She is unhappy no matter where she lives. She believes moving back to London will make her happy. When in fact she was unhappy there the first time. In the 1950's, a house wife reads the novel "Mrs Dalloway". In the more recent year of 2001 a woman is alot like the character Mrs. Dalloway from the 1920's novel of the same name. In this segment of "The Hours" Ed Harris is superb as a middle aged man with AIDS. He's a writer who after becoming ill begins down a road of severe depression. In the 1920's, Nicole Kidman stars.. In the 50's.. Julianne Moore stars, and in the present day segment.. Meryl Streep stars. All 3 stories in time are masterfully weaved together. All our characters have so much in common, tragic things and wonderful things too. Now lets bring up Nicole Kidman's Oscar. Yes she performed beautifully. However was this role deserving of an Oscar in a leading role? Perhaps not, the role was one that I feel was not large enough for a leading role Oscar, and as Denzel Washington said as he gave her the award that night. "Nicole Kidman by a nose!" I love Nicole Kidman, but I would have rather seen her win an award for her flawless work in "The Others". With that being said her work here certainly didn't hurt the movie. Just about everything about this film is worth praising. 4 stars</p></body></html>

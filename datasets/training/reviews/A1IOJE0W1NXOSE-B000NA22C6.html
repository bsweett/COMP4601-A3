He lives alone in a cabin on a lake where he is visited by a man named Shooter who accuses him of plagiarism.  Depp claims that he can prove that this accusation is false, but in the meantime bad things begin to happen to him which he attributes to Shooter.  This is an interesting psychological drama which has just the right amount of twists and turns to keep it interesting.  The acting is good and the scenery is beautiful.</p></body></html>

This movie follows the three main characters around Iraq and the difficulties of performing well in an environment when one does not know who are the enemy and a friend; the movie was actually shot in Jordan and their daily life. Some are dying to get out of here but the main character Sgt James is absolutely devoted to his job. Note the scene towards the end when he is absolutely clueless in his civilian life while he struggles in the cereal aisle or his conversation with his son and his wife. The movie tries to offer us more glimpses in the life of the two other soldiers but only offers glimpses. Although their job is to keep others same, Sgt James in his zeal and bravado sometimes jeopardizes the life of his companions. Hurt Locker refers to the box kept by Sgt. James which has all the trigger mechanisms of the bombs he has defused.<br /><br />At times or rather the entire movie has the feel of a documentary but without a doubt the action scenes especially the fire fight and the several bomb defusing scenes have been shot extremely well. Congrats to the camera man and his assistants. The tension is nail biting and translated well to the screen. It shows us the service the men of the Army are doing for us and a standing ovation to these brave men. The movie deserves a look because it is probably one of the first movies that I have seen that does not politicize the movie; the other one was Taking Chance (read my review) There is a lot to recommend about the movie but characters have been half baked and the story line thin. A lot of big name stars are in this film Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pierce and Evangaline Lilly but blink and you miss them.<br />This year it is a classic battle of the exes i.e. James Cameroon and Kathyrn Bigelow, I place my bets on Avataar. I gave it three stars. 02/05/10</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Predator"></head><body><p>One of my favorite movies ever. Why this did not do as good as Terminator is a mystery to me. Easily the better of the two films by star power alone. Arnold(Terminator), Carl Weathers(Apollo Creed on Rocky), Jesse Ventura(The Body of pro-wrestling,Running Man),Sonny(48 hrs.) are just half of this cast. Special effects are modern to this day. One of the best sci-fi action movies ever made, period.</p></body></html>

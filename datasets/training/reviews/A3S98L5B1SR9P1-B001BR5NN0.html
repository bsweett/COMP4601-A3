<meta name="summary" content="The Breakfast Club"></head><body><p>This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The movie is about these five teenagers from various backgrounds and social statures held in detention on a saturday morning. The theme of this movie is really great because it emphasizes that no matter who you are; we are all the same. Not too much happens in the movie because most of the movie has the characters talking to each other throughout the film.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is a very witty and original movie to own.<br /><br />The High School Reunion Edition DVD comes in a anamorphic widescreen presentation with the choice of Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS 5.1 audio. It also includes a theatrical trailer, and a interactive menu. In other words, it's a barebones disc, but it's worth the purchase for the remastered picture.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cage and Rockwell knock this out of the park"></head><body><p>nothing weak about this nicely done movie directed by Ridley Scott of all people but it is enjoyable throughout. Cage(Adaptation) plays Roy who is a germaphobe and other things like being a conman. Nicley done character drawings. Sam Rockwell(Glory Daze) playing Frank is a standout and Alison Lohman(White Oleander) is cute as Cage's &quot;daughter&quot;. The twist at the end I didnt see coming but it was fun to say the least. Cage gives us another performance to his list and a memorable one to say the least. Also starring Bruce McGill(Animal House). Probably one of the best of 2003</p></body></html>

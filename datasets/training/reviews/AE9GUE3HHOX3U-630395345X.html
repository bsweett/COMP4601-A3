<meta name="summary" content="Plump Friction"></head><body><p>I don't know how many times I've seen this, but the last time I watched Pulp Fiction, I noticed I was reciting dialogue which means I've seen it ALOT. I still love the acting, Samuel L. Jackson shines and this is one of his best roles in a film.  The only part I wish they skipped was the rape scene.  I hate it everytime I have to watch it to follow the story.  The should have cut out the physical act of Ving Rhames being raped, don't need to see that homeboy!  I love Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown and the Kill Bills. QT is one of my favourite directors.  I hope he's doing another good film, fingers crossed.</p></body></html>

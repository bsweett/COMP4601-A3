<meta name="summary" content="Awful!!"></head><body><p>This is a movie where you wait for something to happen and nothing ever does!  What's worse is that the ending did not resolve the story.  Bill Murray as a kind of loser who receives an unsigned note from an old girlfriend claiming that he is the father of her child.  Murray seeks out 4 old girlfriends to find out who might have sent it.  The director tries to be cute by having the daughter of one of the women (named Lolita of course) walk around naked in front of him.  This was supposed to be the comedy in this film?  This movie lacks any real humor and should be avoided at all costs.</p></body></html>

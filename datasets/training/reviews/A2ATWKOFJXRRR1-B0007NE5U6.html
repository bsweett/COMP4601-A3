But here there were so many requirements lacking that I nearly nodded off. A plot would've been nice (instead of wandering around from a skydiving incident to a jail in Thailand); I don't consider a "misunderstanding" about a woman a viable plot device. Renee Zellweger and Colin Firth, whom I thought had a sparky relationship in the first film, have been turned into screenplay robots, reading their lines as if directly from the page.<br /><br />The only saving grace in the story was Hugh Grant (and believe me, I'm not a huge Hugh Grant fan). When he finally showed up in the picture he immediately added some much needed dialogue-infused comedy to the story. And he delivered his lines as if he MEANT them.<br /><br />The sad part for me, too, is that I really like Mrs. Zellweger and Mr. Firth as actors. Renee was excellent in the musical "Chicago"; and Mr. Firth's crowning achievement ("Pride and Prejudice") has yet to be rivaled for a period piece in my humble opinion.<br /><br />I feel that this film was simply a money-grab by the movie studio, trying to benefit off of the success of its predecessor ...and failing miserably.</p></body></html>

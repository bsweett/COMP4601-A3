<meta name="summary" content=""Iron Man" is an Instant Classic"></head><body><p>Now this is how to make a summer movie.  "Iron Man" explodes off the screen with a combustible mix of superstar charisma, heavy metal thunder and the one thing other film's of it ilk willfully forget: soul.  Robert Downey, Jr., a gifted actor long haunted by demons manifested as substance abuse, powers this new-fangled classic as billionaire industrialist Tony Stark, infusing the splashy playboy with bone-dry wit, magnetic charm and, ultimately, huge amounts of heart.  At first, Stark is a willing and content cog in the military industrial complex, reaping huge profits from the sale of self-designed weapons while staying half a world away from the harsh consequences of their use.  And why should he care in the first place?  He's far too busy showing off his high-powered toys of mass destruction; that and bedding every beautiful woman he sees, much to the consternation of his best friend and military liaison Colonel Rhodes (Terrance Howard, every bit as stellar here as Downey, Jr.) and his loyal secretary Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Paltrow is doing some the best work of her career as Stark's romantic equal.  The chemistry between her and Downey, Jr. is palpable, sexy and resonant; kudos to director Jon Favreau and his large team of screenwriters, which includes the scribes for Children of Men, for knowing it's the little things like depth of character that really count.<br /><br />But Stark gets jolted to reality when his military convoy is attacked on a rural Afghani road by warlords who seek to use Stark's technical acumen for their own arsenals.  To add insult to injury, the convoy is attacked with Stark's own weapons, which the extremists have procured through black market sales and illegal arms deals.  Struck in a dank, suffocating cave, Stark first realizes the true gravity of making cavalier billions off of weapons of war.  Conscience awakened, he works to design a new prototype under the nose of those who hold him captive.  With it, he will flee and use it to destroy all the loose arms that are linked to him.  Favreau stages the escape with high impact pow, showing that this film might be battle cry of one of the next great directors.<br /><br />Back in America, Stark keeps himself in seclusion, perfecting a new battlesuit that will allow him to undo the wrong he has inadvertently committed, but not before trying to get his company, inherited from his gung-ho father, to discontinue weapons development.  However, his second in command, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges, a blazing villain), will have none of it.  To him, there's too much green in selling high caliber goods; peace politics are for those too weak to take power and wealth.  So its Stark and his reformed sense of responsibility versus high-rolling capitalism run amok, and their final battle, with two iron-suits rampaging across Southern California, is a doozy.  But the true joy of Iron Man is not its action or seamless special effects.  It's how it seamlessly integrates those elements into a resonant popcorn yarn that stands with the best of the best.  Folks, this is how it's supposed to be done.</p></body></html>

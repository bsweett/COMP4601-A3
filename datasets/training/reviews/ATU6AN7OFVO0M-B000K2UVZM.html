<meta name="summary" content="time to retire BRIAN!"></head><body><p>Brian De Plma was one of my favorites. his Scarface was a masterpiese and his previous film "Femme Fatal" Although had some problems in scenario, but was wery intresting and enjoyable till the end. But here we have a superflat, super boring movie! I watched it cause i taught maybe it got better or had a surprise end. but it got worse and worse. Also the production had problems. God, Brian is getting old!</p></body></html>

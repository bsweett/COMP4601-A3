<meta name="summary" content="a vastly entertaining film just got greater!..."></head><body><p>HAVING SEEN THE FILM THEATRICALLY 3 TIMES UPON IT'S INITIAL RELEASE, I WAS FLOORED THIS MORNING WHEN I SAW THE FULL PAGE AD IN THE SUNDAY NY TIMES, THAT 'APOLLO 13'WAS FINALLY GOING TO BE GIVEN THE DELUXE TREATMENT ON DVD THAT IT SO LOVINGLY DESERVES. WHAT ASTOUNDED ME EVEN MORE ABOUT THIS REMARKEABLE RELEASE IS THAT IN ADDITION TO THE FILM, AND DOCUMENTARIES, DISC 2 IS TO BE PRESENTED IN THE AWESOME IMAX VERSION AND IN GLORIOUS DTS SOUND! AND THE PRICE IS A STEAL. THANK YOU, UNIVERSAL, FOR GIVING US A CLASSIC IN A PRESENTATION SO WELL DESERVED. A GREAT FILM, JUST GOT GREATER.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Theron is Oscar worthy"></head><body><p>A bulked up and chunky Charlize Theron is mesmerizing in her stunning and somewhat sympathetic portrayal of hard case Florida highway prostitute and executed serial killer Aileen Wuornos.  Beaten and abused as a child Wuornos turns to turning tricks early on and essentially grows up on the streets.<p>She meets Selby, played wonderfully by Christina Ricci, a sexually conflicted young woman in a bar in Florida and they soon become lesbian lovers.  Theron vows to support her and show her the good life.  With no marketable workplace skills she reverts to prostitution to make some money.  While servicing a john she gets manacled and savagely beaten.  She manages to free herself and in a justifiable homicide, shoots and kills the pervert with a gun she'd been carrying.  She robs his money and car.<p>With pressure on Theron to support Ricci financially her mind takes a severe psychological twist.<p>Theron in her defining role shows awesome acting ability, far beyond her previous efforts.  The scope of her performance overshadows that of Ricci who was also noteworthy.  Bruce Dern, in a supporting role is his usual creepy self.Kudos to the makeup artist who transformed the gorgeous Theron into the tough looking dark rooted blonde that was Wuornos.</p></body></html>

What good thing could be said of this movie? Nada.  I was hoping for something more from this fabulously overhyped piece of junk. It's a bad movie because these people simply have no redeeming features about them. As a result, the movie seems overly contrived and without direction. Avoid this one like the plague; you'll be better off saving a few books.</p></body></html>

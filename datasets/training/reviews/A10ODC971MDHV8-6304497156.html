<meta name="summary" content="Night of the Living Dead"></head><body><p>he first and best of George Romero's zombie series, a horror classic made on a low five figure budget way back in 1968. Some of the acting is less than stellar, but this hardly affects the tightening knot in your stomach. More restrained than later outings, the zombies are less turbo-charged, which only increases the prevailing sense of dread. Film builds to a nifty surprise finish. Consistently creepy, punctuated by moments of unbridled terror. Be warned!</p></body></html>

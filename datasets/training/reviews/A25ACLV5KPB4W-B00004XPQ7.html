This Revolutionary War saga is amazingly similar to Braveheart, in that a peace loving but fiercely able Gibson is forced from a pastoral life by malevolent political forces. The movie is not without highlights, notably Gibson and his two young sons taking on a handful of British soldiers, but the payoffs are ho-hum. It's not that the movie is bad, just that it's predictably exactly what a solidly-done Hollywood period piece about the Revolutionary War would look like.</p></body></html>

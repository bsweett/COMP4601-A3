<meta name="summary" content="I  bought it because of the packaging"></head><body><p>I've heard so many good (and not so good) reviews of this, I've been teetering between either buying or renting. Well, I just bought this and wait until you see the packaging - there's actual blood sealed inside the front, clear cover and it moves all around!! Not only that, but there's a minature saw blade that moves too. It defintely pushed me over the edge. Hopefully the movie is as good (especially "uncut") and creative as the package it came in. I'll know soon enough. If only more studios had it in them to be this inspired (and willing to spend the cash).</p></body></html>

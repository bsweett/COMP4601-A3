<meta name="summary" content="A well-made movie that is more fiction than fact"></head><body><p>As a motion picture, From Hell is quite good.  Just don't look for any truths about Jack the Ripper to emerge from the movie.  While it is based on the Whitechapel murders and does an adequate job presenting some factual information (such as the locations and conditions of the bodies), the premise is based on a thoroughly discredited and rather laughable theory; there is also much fiction in the relationships of the murder victims, and many important events and individuals are ignored altogether.  The film does a decent job of depicting Whitechapel, but it never really comes close to portraying the true filth and miserable conditions of the real Whitechapel, nor does it succeed in revealing the humanity of the unfortunate victims.  Certainly one pities the poor women who must engage in prostitution merely to survive, but the utter hopelessness and darkness of their world does not really manifest itself in the movie.  The portrayals of the murders themselves are quite good and were clearly done with an eye toward accuracy.  I was glad to see that no real attempt was made to show the true state of the final victim's body because nothing can possibly convey the utter horror of that scene.  Johnny Depp is marvelous as Inspector Abberline; Heather Graham is a wonderful Mary Kelly, but her character never really came across as a down and out prostitute.  The characters involved in the murders and conspiracy, whom I will not name for fear of giving something away, are also quite good.  I can accept and even applaud the "solution" this movie portrays, as there are a couple of really ingenious aspects of the whole conspiracy, and I felt the ending was quite proper and touchingly subtle.  Needless to say, this is a rather depressing story all the way around.  There is not an overabundance of horror, as the real dirty work of the Ripper is never shown to the audience, so the squeamish can probably make it through until the end with a minimum of head turns.  <p>As an armchair Ripperologist, I am compelled to state that the identify of the Ripper and the complex story surrounding the "solution" here are not at all historical.  The movie makers took as their premise a thoroughly discredited story, and on top of this they added several completely original ideas.  For example, Inspector Abberline is here portrayed as an opium addict who has visions of the Ripper murders.  The victims supposedly know each other and are marked out for death for a quite specific reason.  All of the juiciest Ripper gossip and wildest speculations are injected into this movie.  For those with little knowledge of the Whitechapel murders, please understand that the murderer, whoever he was, was certainly not the culprit named in this movie.  If you want to learn the history of these crimes, forget almost everything you see here.  This movie is to be enjoyed as a dark, Gothic motion picture because that is all it is.  <p>I must say I was disappointed by the bonus material on the accompanying disc.  The documentary about Jack the Ripper is the worst such documentary I have ever seen.  On the one hand, you have someone pointing an amateur camera over Donald Rumbelow's shoulder--often losing the focus as the camera zooms in and out--as he flips through pages of a book of Ripper-related drawings--the most exciting part of this segment is the moment when Rumbelow announces he has to cough and then does so.  On the other hand, you have a fairly old interview of less than stellar quality with a man who asserts that the true facts are those that we see presented in the movie, which is simply untrue and has no evidence upon which to stand.  I was most disappointed by the tour of the murder sites.  Some of the actual murder locations still exist today, and there is in fact a tour offered of the murder sites in modern Whitechapel, but the "tour" on the DVD turns out to be a tour of the movie set; the tour guides are the two directors, who make a big joke out of the whole tour and murders.  The deleted scenes are interesting, especially the alternate ending, but I rejoice that such scenes were all deleted because they would have potentially ruined the movie, in my opinion.  Finally, there is an inane 9-minute documentary about absinthe--while Depp's Abberline consumed this dangerous drink as an aid for his visionary powers, absinthe has less than nothing to do with Jack the Ripper.  I'm still giving this DVD four stars because I enjoyed the highly fictionalized movie, but the accompanying DVD really detracts from the overall package.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I enjoyed it!"></head><body><p>I'm actually a humongous fan of Marvel Comics Fantastic Four.  From owning a large collection of the comic books to toy hunting for the hard-to-get Invisible Woman action figures.<br /><br />  But I kept myself away from any coverage, hype regarding the film, so I can enjoy it to the nth degree.<br /><br />  I have to admit that I felt a bit cautious because although the Fantastic Four have been a staple of Marvel Comics history, it's not the in your face action such as X-Men and even Spider-Man.<br />  It's one of those series that has to grow on you and you learn to enjoy the characters.<br /><br />  So,  I imagined that like the first X-Men movie where they had to go through an introduction, the same would have to be done with the first Fantastic Four movie.<br /><br />  Sure, there will be a lot of action but at the same time, you need to know how the characters are.<br /><br />  Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) is not your typical lead man.  He's highly intelligent, detached from society somewhat and can be a cold fish.<br /><br />  Johnny Storm (Human Torch) is the hothead.  Playboy and always seems to get himself into something dangerous.<br /><br />  Ben Grimm, the man who deals with being the rocky behemoth known as the Thing.<br />  And Sue Storm, the woman who loves Reed but somehow tries to find ways to get close to him (despite him being a cold and dull fish at times).<br /><br />  So, needless to say...our heroes have their problems and for some who are looking for the charismatic action hero, they are superheroes but they aren't perfect.<br /><br />  I happened to enjoy the film.  The pacing was a bit off at times but nevertheless, I enjoyed it and optomistic that the second movie can now be fast-paced and hard hitting.<br /><br />  The DVD for Fantastic Four was very enjoyable with really cool.  The DVD is offered in two versions (widescreen and fullscreen) and audio quality is offered in 5.1 DTS (which sounds really awesome on my home theater).<br /><br />  The special features for this DVD doesn't disappoint either as it feature full length audio commentary by the stars of the film, a video diary featuring the stars on their media tour for the film - which was very exciting by the way.  Deleted scenes, making of featurette, casting session, making a scene, music videos, theatrical teaser and trailer and also an inside look for the third X-Men film (which unusually got the top listing for the special features).<br /><br />  Not everyone is going to enjoy the Fantastic Four film.  Even the comic book is not for everyone but those who stick with it learn to enjoy the characters for what they are.<br /><br />  If I had any problem, many of us who are faithful to FF, knows that Dr. Doom doesn't go down that easily.  Otherwise Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis and Julian McMahon do a great job portraying the characters.<br /><br />  Again, this is just the introductory film.  Hopefully with the second film, things get even better.  As for the DVD, it's fantastic.</p></body></html>

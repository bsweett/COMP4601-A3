What does it possibly have to do with the real-life murder of a young Hollywood hopeful in the 1940's? Well, nothing really. The movie is overloaded with information, the least of which is sometimes the murder of Elizabeth Short, whose mutilated body was found like a decrepit piece of sculptured artwork in Los Angeles in 1947. The filmmakers deny it in the bonus features, but it's film noir, with shadowy lighting, intriguing characters, and haunting jazz trumpet score, and on this level, it's an almost restful and enjoyable film to watch, as characters clearly pay homage to the tough talking guys and alluring exotic femme fatales of '40's film noir. It's central theme, however, something concerning Hollywood decadence, gets muddled in what seems a conventional and complicated police story, and the emergence of plot lines that rival the main story. It's pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey resolution is estranged, and it's multi-storylines collide more than they mesh. Director Brian De Palma's Hitchcockian style works well in seperate entities as opposed to the entirety of the film, and the cast, for the most part, are forever inviting you farther into the film with evolving characterizations, even when you can't possibly take on another police bulletin of worthless information. I was never bored for a moment, the film is that sensually stylized, but it is finally grossly unsatisfying, like a Playboy magazine without a centerfold, or indeed, an unsolved murder.</p></body></html>

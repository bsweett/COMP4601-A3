<meta name="summary" content="The fear is the oxygen of the extortion!"></head><body><p>In certain opportunity, Benjamin Franklin affirmed: "When a nation decides to sacrifice their freedom in order to get security, don't deserve to obtain neither one of both".<br /><br />In the name of faith, unity, national security, preservation of the ethical ideals, religious beliefs or any other argued concept, a Government has made use of the force and the oppression to offer the people security against all those who intend to break the rules of the status quo.<br /><br />On the dawn of the Seventieth century, there was a man who died for preserved his own ideals. Four centuries later, V made his appearance. This smart plot combined clever and timely the ancestral legend of the Phantom Opera, the famous Count of Monte Christ, and through a wise game of crossed words and an admirable use of the semiotic, produced an underworld hero, "V" . curiously V was the signal of victory used by Churchill, but besides it might be regarded vengeance, virus and violence, who emerges from the sashes and the forgetfulness, who makes a smart plan after a terrible disgrace on Queen Mary's Hospital, as consequence of a failed experiment.<br /><br />In this sense, one might affirm the urban legend follows the mythical traces where the bad guys belong to the highest sphere of the government, featured by a visible Nazi taste (once more the semiotic lexicon, the use of the flags, the huge manifestations of submission and febrile obedience before the shelter state, the figure of the First Chancellor, who never talks directly to his subordinates, with clear reminiscences of George Orwell's 1984's Big brother)<br /><br />The rest of the movie runs for you, marvellously edited, magisterially filmed and supported by a tense and unpredictable script will lead the spectator to a chilling and surprising climax, with the accords of 1812 Overture, another semiotic element of well known historical transcendence.<br /><br />Natalie Portman once more carves in relief her outstanding skills as character actress, Hugh Weaving as V gives a very convincing role and finally the emblematic John Hurt (who precisely was part of the cast of 1984) as the hated Chancellor conform a well-rounded film that will reward even the most exigent of the spectators.<br /><br />To my mind, this movie must be included among the most emblematic cult movies of this raising century.</p></body></html>

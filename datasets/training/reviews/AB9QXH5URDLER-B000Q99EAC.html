Rocky is older and has grown in wisdom through the years.  This film does not try to recapture Rocky's youth.  It is a good film for aging baby boomers.  It is a must see for Rocky fans.  It is a little slow and sentimental for those who are not already Rocky fans.  If you like Rocky, watch the film.  If you are not a Rocky fan let it pass.</p></body></html>

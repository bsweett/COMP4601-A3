We see with what finesse he is able to confront both in this stylish and lovable movie. Braddock is a fine boxer, able to support himself and his family well.  He breaks his hand in a fight and manfully tries to keep going, only to ruin his career.  It doesn't help that the Depression comes along to take what's left of him and his family.  He does all he can to survive, like most Americans during desperate times, but he picks himself up until he gets another chance.  After working on the shipyard and his hand recovers, he gets to go back in the ring.  He gradually succeeds until he can face Max Bauer, a cruel and notorious fighter.<br /><br />"Cinderella Man" is a super movie.  It has the struggle and heart of the best boxing movies (like "Rocky" and "Raging Bull") especially with a good story to go behind the scenes. The performances are formidable.  Russell Crowe is brimming with toughness and decency as Braddock, and Renee Zellweger is nuanced as his nervous, but caring wife.  Paul Giamatti is also in fine form as his manager.  Director Ron Howard has accomplished much by zeroing in on every detail; every development and every punch line is embellished well in this movie.</p></body></html>

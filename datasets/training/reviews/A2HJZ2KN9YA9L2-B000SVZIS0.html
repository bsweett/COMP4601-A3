<meta name="summary" content="Tim Burton's most mainstream film"></head><body><p>The first challenge when watching this movie is to try to forget the 1968 classic.  This movie exists entirely as its own singular entity, with more action, a stronger emphasis on the civil rights and animal rights debate and almost completely eliminating the evolution theory debate that formed the backbone of the original.  <p>There is more action in this movie, too, with some genuinely spectacular visual effects extremely worthy of an Academy Award.  <p>But enough of this.  I would not have bothered with watching this movie had it been directed by anyone other than Tim Burton.  He is one of those directors who has a distinct personality, like Terry Gilliam, early Steven Spielberg or Alfred Hitchcock, there are certain trademark moves or images that he uses that distinguishes each movie as a Tim Burton film.  (He would have been the ideal choice to direct The Grinch, as his imagery often has strong parallels to the illustrations in Dr. Seuss)<p>Those images are muted in this movie.  Probably by necessity as the setting is more alien than anything Tim Burton has presented us with before.  His strength was in showing movies where the real world was twisted into a surreal extreme (the pastel colors of suburbia in Edward Scissorhands; the towering cathedrals of Gotham in Batman &amp; Batman Returns).<p>We still get off-beat scenes such as an ape wearing a toupee &amp; dentures mixed in with the action &amp; adventure, but as it stands, the scene that stands out as feeling the most like a vintage Tim Burton moment is the controversial twist ending.  It does play with the final revelation of the conclusion of the original Planet of the Apes movie.  But of course the last shot of that movie was a final commentary on nuclear war, while the ending of this Apes picture is simply there to play with our minds.  That is not necessarily a bad thing.  While the original Apes will always be regarded as a classic piece of filmmaking in its own right, this Apes movie will be regarded as an entertaining addition to Tim Burton's body of work as a filmmaker, something of a change of pace from his regular productions.</p></body></html>

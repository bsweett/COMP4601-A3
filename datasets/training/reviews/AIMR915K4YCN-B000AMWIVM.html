<meta name="summary" content="What Would YOUR First Movie Look Like?..."></head><body><p>I love SAW! I mean, it had a micro-budget and just over two weeks shooting time! How many recent "horror" movies have come and gone, costing zillions of dollars and taking months to complete, only to stink up our theaters? I like it when unknown directors come along and give us movies that ignore the hollywood formula of $$$ + HYPE - ORIGINALITY = $$$$$$ (like: Night Of The Living Dead, Dementia 13, Carnival Of Souls, Spider Baby, The -original- Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Donnie Darko, May, etc.). SAW actually held my interest throughout, and genuinely shocked me at the end. Remember how the ending in SE7EN made you feel? I sure do, and SAW made me feel that same wonderful mix of dread and amazement! Any flaws can be easily excused considering the aforementioned budget and time constraints. Just watch it and enjoy it...</p></body></html>

The cast is amazing especially Michelle Pfeiffer, Amanda Bynes, and James Mardsen (his voice is amazing, who knew!) This film is just as good as other classic musicals, the songs and dance numbers are absolutely brilliant, I couldn't take my eyes off the t.v. screen. My favorite song is Miss Baltimore Crabs. This is a great family film, I highly recommend it! Also buy the cd as well. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

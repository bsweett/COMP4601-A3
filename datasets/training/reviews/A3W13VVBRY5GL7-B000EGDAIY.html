<meta name="summary" content="Satisfying and Stylish"></head><body><p>I have not seen the original of this movie, so (if the reviews of others are anything to go by), I am lucky to be able to judge this movie without the acclaimed original in my head as a template.<br /><br />And, I am both amazed and happy to report, as a movie in its own right, this version of "The Grudge" more than holds its own against its contemporary horror heavyweights.<br /><br />Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar (in a much smaller role than one would have thought) and a host of forgettable extras (with the exception of Bill Pullman, again in a tiny role), this movie loosely follows the `haunted house' plot of so many horror movies - funny goings-on inspire further investigation, leading to a high-body-count misadventure resulting in closure for our hapless heroine - but since "The Grudge" rehashes this predictable-ish plot with such undeniable style and flair, as well as a few big twists, we don't mind.<br /><br />The first thing that strikes me about this movie is that yes, it is genuinely creepy, with some true-blue shock moments. The jump factor is high, and these shocks and scares (bar the initial dealings with Yoko, the care-worker) never feel tired or predictable. It's thanks directly to the expert direction of Takashi Shimizu that this is the case.<br /><br />Initially, the American Exchange Students-moving-to-Japan plot element feels like a cheat - divisive and base, and a way of moving the action of this remake closer to the tone of the original movie - but happily, an above-average script (for the genre) and a lack of focus on the Westernisation of the lead characters means that this actually works more in the movie's favour. Karen, Doug, the Williams family and the  Kirk family all feel more isolated and alone in their nightmare because of the culture barrier, and not because of some run-of-the-mill horror movie aspects.<br /><br />Visual effects are minimalist and achingly stylish, the scene with the security cameras and the final black-and-white expository flashbacks are some really marvellous examples of what can be established when real talent sits behind the camera, unencumbered by a desire to show off. Affecting and moving, the washed-out colours and ingenious creatures and set-pieces provide a very sympathetic (almost forgiving!) backdrop for some solid, if unstellar, performances from the cast.<br /><br />All in all, this really is an excellent effort, and, when taken in-context with its genre peers (The Ring, Dark Water), it's probably the best of the remakes, too. If `Candyman' was the best horror movie of the Ninties, then `The Grudge' is certainly a contender for that crown now. Recommended.</p></body></html>

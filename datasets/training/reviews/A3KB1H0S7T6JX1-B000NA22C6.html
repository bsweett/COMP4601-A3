<meta name="summary" content="Though not a masterpiece, a movie worth watching!"></head><body><p>Secret Window brings to the screen an adaptation of another of Stephen King's books; this one about a series of crimes that take place in the life of author/writer Mort Rainey, played by Johnny Depp.<br /><br />Though not a masterpiece, Secret Window is a good movie, guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment.  The casting is very good, and the story very well written.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it lacks that something to put it over the top.  After seeing The Others and The Sixth Sense, it becomes a bit predictable, though Stephen King has not lost his touch in providing an unexpected ending.<br /><br />In addition, there is a slight hint of Misery in the Secret Window, what with the writer/author in the middle of nowhere and all.<br /><br />Overall, it is a movie definitely worth watching, even though you might not want to go the extra mile and purchase it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Walk This Way!"></head><body><p>Piece of trivia:  Aerosmith went to a midnight movie showing of YOung Frankenstein, when they saw Igor say "Walk this way" and Gene Wilder followed him exactly "walking this way" they thought it was hilarious.  Hence, the title of their famous hit, "Walk This Way".<br /><br />Frankenstein was never meant to be funny, but somehow a genius like Mel Brooks turned it into a classic comedy.  The humor is smutty without offense, silly without being jeuvenile, and timeless.  Here we take the fabled tale of Dr Frankenstein creating his monster and making it a hilarious madcap adventure.  Gene Wilder was at his all time funniest, with his neurotic comedy and screaming fits (of which I modeled my own humor after).  Igor, though no longer with us, was so ugly and revolting that he could've only been an actor playing the weirdo sidekick.  While Terri Garr would go on to play far smarter characters in her career, she was at her buxom airheaded best.  ("Would you like to have a roll in the hay? ... It's fun!  ... Roll!  Roll!  Roll in the hay!")<br /><br />This was also Madeline Khan's (though also no longer with us) greatest moment.  She was at her all time funniest as the vain and self centered fiancee of Gene Wilder, then to have her inner sex kitten come out thanks to Peter Boyle's monster's enormous stranstooker.  (And if you have to be told what that is, then maybe this isn't the movie for you.)<br /><br />The special features are hilarious, as you hear the obvious love and affetion the crew had for this movie.  I was disappointed that Gene Wilder didn't contribute, but then again a lot of comics in real life aren't really "funny guys", and perhaps he hardly says a word should you meet him.</p></body></html>

The Prestige is a reference to the 3rd part of a magicians trick. I.e. having made the bird and cage disappear (the 2nd part) the bird then reappears.<br /><br />Two magicians are close friends but because of a tragedy become bitter enemies. Unlike a previous reviewer I thought Christian Bales cockney accent was very convincing and Hugh Jackman without his Wolverine makeup is only just recognisable. Both lead actors are excellent and the supporting cast are good as well. David Bowie has an important cameo role in the film, on which the main plot hinges.<br /><br />The plot is quite complicated to follow in places, so you do have to concentrate, as various sequences move backward or forward in time. OK you can't take it seriously, but there is an edgy atmosphere to the whole thing that kept me rivited to the screen. You shouldn't be to surprised at this though as the director is Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, Memento) whose films, have to date proved to be of a consistently high standard.</p></body></html>

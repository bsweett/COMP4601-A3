<meta name="summary" content="Modestly successful sequel"></head><body><p>In a genre where sequels fare poorly, this exceeded expectation.  The movie starts 28 weeks after England was ravaged by the virus in 28 days later.  The US army has taken control of the country, the zombies have died out, and folks are slowly repopulating.  The writers put a stronger family element than most zombie flicks.  Of course things don't go well, and there's a lot of sprinting away from the bad guys.  The movie's pace is very quick and it's over before you know it.<br /><br />The downside are plot holes bigger than you could imagine.  There's a lot more of "What are they thinking?" than usual - despite the genre.  That said, I'll see 28 Months Later if they come out with it.</p></body></html>

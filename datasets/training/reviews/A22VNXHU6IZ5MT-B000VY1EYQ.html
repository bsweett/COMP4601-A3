I guess It was really the great storyline and ensemble of great acting talent especially Keri Russell,Cheryl Hines,Jeremy Sisto and the one and only Andy Griffith. The sad thing is the director Adrienne Shelly(who also has a supporting role in the film) was murdered in real life,her career was cut way to short.This DVD includes some great extras,especially the Memorial Featurette to director Shelly. A great "slice of pie" comedy!!! Recommended A+</p></body></html>

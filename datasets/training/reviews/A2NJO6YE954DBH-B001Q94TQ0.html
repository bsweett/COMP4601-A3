<meta name="summary" content="Catalina Sandino Moreno's compelling debut performance"></head><body><p>In this week's "Entertainment Weekly" Stephen King picked "Maria Full of Grace" as his favorite film of 2004, which is certainly an interesting thing to know before watching this independent film from writer-director Joshua Marston.  The picture on the DVD cover shows Maria Alvarez (Catalina Sandino Moreno) posed as if she were about to receive Holy Communion.  Only instead of receiving the host Maria is about to swallow a pellet containing heroin wrapped in the finger of a latex glove.  That particular image is not present in the film with as much symbolism as it is on the cover, but it does represent the crucible of Maria's odyssey.<br /><br />Maria is 17 and works in Colombia picking the thorns off of roses before they are shipped overseas.  Although she is clearly a bright girl, Maria discovers that she is pregnant.  To make things worse her boyfriend is a loser, her boss at work is a jerk, and her family needs her to provide money.  So after Maria quits her job she is introduced to a man in Bogot&aacute; who will give her $5,000 for flying to New York City with 62 of those pellets in her stomach as a "mule" for a drug lord.  For Maria that amount is a virtual fortune and seems worth the risk that one of those pellets could break in her stomach and kill her.  So she practices swallow grapes so that she will be able to do what needs to be done to get her money.<br /><br />There will be several mules on this particular flight, a practice known as "shotgunning" that Marston learned about and which inspired his original script.  The idea is that if you put several mules on the same plane and plan on U.S. Customs catching one of them, which would make it easier for the rest of the drugs to get through.  Also on the plane with Maria are her friend, Blanca (Yenny Paola Vega), who is jealous of the money her friend is going to make, a mule on her third run, Lucy (Giulied Lopez), who wants to visit her sister in New York City, and at least one more experience drug smuggler.<br /><br />"Maria Full of Grace" sets the stage for the big trip by paying attention to the process by which Maria first practices, and then swallows all those pellets.  This serves to underscore how dangerous this is going to be and you know that something is going to go horribly wrong.  It is just a question of how many of these girls will be dead by the time it is all over and what exactly Maria will do to earn the sobriquet of the title.  Marston does touch on all of the mules on the plane, but the focus of the story is on Moreno and her compelling performance.  Clearly Marston is out to make a point, but because this is a low-budget independent film he is forced to tell it simply.  Ironically, his leading actress is so good that we are concerned more with her survival than any stinging indictment of the use of mules by Colombian drug cartels.<br /><br />Catalina Sandino Moreno won the best actress award a the 2004 Berlin Film Festival along with Charlize Theron in "Monster," which is interesting simply because the performances are pretty much at opposite ends of the acting spectrum.  Since "Maria Full of Grace" premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 18, 2004, where it won the Audience Award, Moreno's performance would be eligible for the next Academy Awards.  Usually Oscar nominations focus on movies released in December and as a rule ignore anything released before the Summer blockbuster season, but what Moreno did in this film might be too impressive to forget (Addendum: For once I was right and Moreno is nominated for Best Actress).</p></body></html>

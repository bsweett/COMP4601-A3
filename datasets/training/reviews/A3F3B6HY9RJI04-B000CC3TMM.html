<meta name="summary" content="More Action Than the First"></head><body><p>Jason Stratham returns as Frank Martin, the transporter for hire.  He lived by three rules in the first movie and from the get-go he has abandoned the second and third rule as he chouffers a kid from school for a rich family.  He has even added a new rule in this movie.<br /><br />When the kid gets kidnapped, Frank intends on keeping his promise to keep him safe from harm.  Little does he realize what is really involved.<br /><br />Last the first movie, this one is loaded with action.  The plot is improved upon in my opinion but the acting isn't.  Francois Berleand also returns from the first film as the French detective and was the highlight of the movie for me.<br /><br />If you love action, check this film out.  Still not the best out there but it will keep you entertained for an hour and a half.</p></body></html>

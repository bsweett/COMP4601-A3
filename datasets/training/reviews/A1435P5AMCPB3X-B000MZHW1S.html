The movie does a great job at showing the harsh and tough to face details of what may be occuring in the "conflict countries" such as Sierra Lion.  Leonardo Di Caprio plays an illeagal Diamond trader who meets a local fisherman (Djimon Hounsou) that has hidden away a secret that can change both of their lives.  Di Caprio wants to leave africa and his way of life once and for all, Hounsou wants to get his family back and into a safe place.  With the help of Jennifer Connely, a reporter, they hunt thier way back to a place where Housou's character endured horrible traumas.<br /><br />  This is an action packed film with some nice twists, and overall eye opening drama to what is occuring even today.  Rent this, buy this, you won't be dissapointed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great concept, poor execution"></head><body><p>Even though most people on Amazon don't seem to like honest reviews, here we go anyway:<br /><br />The idea behind the movie is cool: it's in the 2020s and the human race has lost the ability to reproduce; the last child was born 18 years ago. What they do with that idea, however, is another matter.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the plot of CoM is strained and not satisfying. There's not enough back-story and there are too many loose ends that are not resolved/explained. The ending was a bit clich&eacute; as well. The pieces just don't really fit together as a story. In fact, the whole thing was VERY reminiscent of "28 Days"--plot, style, setting, ending, everything. (Maybe it was the same producer? I don't care enough to check.)<br /><br />If I would have spent $18 to see this in the theater (or to purchase the DVD), then I would have been seriously hacked-off. I guess it's worth the $3 rental though.<br /><br />Disappointing. Not recommended.</p></body></html>

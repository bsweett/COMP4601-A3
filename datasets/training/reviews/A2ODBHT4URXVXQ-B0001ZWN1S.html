<meta name="summary" content="A truly flawless film classic"></head><body><p>For years I avoided seeing this movie. I'd heard something about a bloody horse's head in bed with a man, and I thought, Why would I want to watch such a thing?<br />How wrong I was. I'm sixty years old, and I just watched this movie for the first time. Now I know what all the hoopla has been about, why so many of the actors went on to become stars, how Coppola's fame was developed/enhanced, and why it has spawned what, four? Sequels. What a terrific film. Yes, it's a true classic.<br />As everyone probably knows, it's the story of a Mafia dynasty headed by patriarch Vito Corleone, played by the perfectly cast and incomparable Marlon Brando. Al Pacino, looking impossibly young, plays the conflicted and rebellious eldest son who finds himself sucked into assuming his father's mantle, carrying on family tradition...<br />Oh, lordy, it's a great movie that explores so many universal themes: the immigrant experience, loyalty, death, tradition, dreams for one's children, crime, honor.<br />If you've never seen it, see it now. If you've already seen it, see it again.</p></body></html>

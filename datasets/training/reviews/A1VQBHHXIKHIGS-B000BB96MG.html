<meta name="summary" content="Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"></head><body><p>The film is delicious, and I don't even like chocolate.<br /><br />I brought some baggage along, since I suffered through that 70s (I think) Disneyed (I think) version in my childhood. Gawd, did that ever suck. Roald Dahl, meanwhile, is an author I spent a bit of time enjoying a few years ago. What he wrote for adults is brilliant. What he wrote for children is brilliant. He never talks down to anybody, which is part of his brilliance. Plus his way with words, plus the fact that I think he was absolutely nuts. In a good way, okay?<br /><br />As I watched this DVD, I saw a few bits that were modernized. Otherwise, it was impossible to tell which bits were Dahl and which were Tim Burton. And nobody cares. Nor should they. Tim Burton was born to turn a Roald Dahl masterpiece into a film. The spirit of the Dahl story, which I haven't read, was undoubtedly here. Damn, this movie is so much fun. I hate that my DVD (from China, not Amazon) has bad spots, meaning I had to skip a couple of segments. I'll find another copy, though, and watch it again. This is an instant classic.</p></body></html>

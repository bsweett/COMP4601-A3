The film has all the ingredients for a terrific story - romance, intrigue, and heroism. Ingrid Bergman's luminous presence along with a top notch cast including Bogie, Claude Rains, Peter Lorrie and Paul Henreid make this movie a classic. And don't forget the song "As Time Goes By" which Arthur "Dooley" Wilson immortalized as Sam, the popular piano player of Rick's American Caf&eacute;. Casablanca, as escape for refugees and a haven for spies, exudes its own corrupt and exotic ambiance. Even if you're not a fan of classic movies, Casablanca is worth watching just to understand the cultural references that it inspired including a great Bugs Bunny parody Carrotblanca that I remember watching as a kid!</p></body></html>

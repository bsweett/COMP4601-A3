<meta name="summary" content="Intruiging and creepy!"></head><body><p>This Harry Potter installment has more story, more intrigue. The conflict Harry has concerning his "true nature" is very effective.<br /><br />The young actors all give fine performances, and the special effects are top notch. Some of the "creatures" may be too intense for very young children.<br /><br />A must for any fantasy DVD collection.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel "The Shroud of Torrington."</p></body></html>

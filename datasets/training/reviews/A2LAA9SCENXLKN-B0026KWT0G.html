<meta name="summary" content="It's complicated in a very Jason way."></head><body><p>For all my reviews visit my website<br /><br />I am NOT reviewing the DVD. Just the movies unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above is possibly skewed by the ratings on this specific site. There might be a slightly different rating at the end.<br /><br />The first hour is completely lame. No gore, and virtually no kills. Very little Jason. It's all Elementary School level drama. The bully to get attention situation. WE SAW THIS WHEN WE WERE 8, WE WANT SOME STEAK NOT BABY MILK!!!! Fortunately, the last 35 minutes include some awesome as he11 kills. In one scene *SPOILER ALERT* We see Jason slice his machete through a dude's upside-down body!!! *SPOILER ALERT OVER.* This also has the cheesiest soundtrack ever, a huge downturn from the original. The movie is also very random. Roadkill and hippies coming out of nowhere. Scenes are just placed wherever. Oh, and did I forget to mention it's in 3-D?<br /><br />The 3-D WOULD be better than Digital 3D if it weren't for the fact that it's cardboard glasses that are square. So, my prescription glasses made the movie way less entertaining. It was so distracting. Now, you're probably screaming at the screen "CHANGE IT TO 2D! DOESN'T THE DVD HAVE THAT OPTION?" Well yeah, it does. But I wanted to experience it the way the creators meant it to. BTW, at 23:25, you can see Jason's silhouette hidden on the van door. Also, Jason is weak in this film! YOU DON'T DO THAT! You can make him human (sort of) to damage. But don't make him weak! Not Jared from Subway nor God, he is Andre the Giant of Slasher Films!<br /><br />And the rules. This is the film where #1 evolved into taking a shower. It's debatable about a new Rule #7: Don't get in a car. But it definably was created through the rest of the series, especially in Part VI: Jason Lives. The ending, I don't think it really can be spoiled. But don't read the next sentence if you think. It's a blatant rip-off of the original with Jason's mom. But here's the thing: MRS. VOORHEES DID NOT @#$%ING DROWN!!! And with the original already got me by the B@11$, it definably doesn't have the same effect. And here's a question: what about Jason's father? With the cheap cheap cheap cheap shot shot shot shots that this has taken to the series, could we please see that? Are we gonna see it in another part? Tune in next time!<br /><br />The Rating? Well...the first hour gets a 1/5. The last 1/3rd gets a 3.6/5. This averages to 2.05/5. And that last .05 gets taken out with the annoying 3-D glasses (for my personal experience.) But since other people view the movie, it all averages out to an extremely complex 2.025/5!!!!<br /><br />I, Da Ca$hman signing off.</p></body></html>

Even if you are the happiest go-lucky person before you walk in, you will feel a malaise when you walk out of the theater.  Anyone who is clinically depressed or has thoughts of suicide should not see this movie.  Many disturbing themes are interwoven into the story: depression, suicide attempts, suicide, abandonment, sexual identity confusion and persistent loneliness.<p>That being said, the acting is superb and the film is a masterful work and a great movie to study for aspiring filmmakers, actors and directors. Nicole Kidman's role tends to get the most attention due to the prothsetic nose she wears - but all the actors, from the youngest child on up are at the top of their game.<p>In the final months of her life, Virginia Woolf wrote the story of "Mrs. Dalloway," a lonely housefrau who eventually takes her life and surprised everyone... because she did it "for no reason."  Her novel reveals much of her inner turmoil - that she is a person that can be understood by no one, not even herself. Her depression so consumes her, that she cannot see clear from it. More than just consistantly mopey, she is almost devoid of any emotions, but when her emotions peak, they are of loneliness and sadness. She experiences guilt for the emotional baggage she has thrown into the lap of her husband and has such a low self-esteem that she lets her housekeepers openly mock her.<p>The film shifts forward and back in time - opening w/ Woolf's suicide, then jumping to 1951, where Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a lonley housefrau herself, reading Woolf's novel.  The film then moves to 2001 with an equally lonely divorcee, now lesbian, who is such the embodiment of Woolf's depressed character that her best friend refers to her as "Mrs. Dalloway."  Ed Harris plays her best friend and ex-lover who is in the final stages of full-blown AIDS.  He, too, struggles with loneliness and depression, as most of his so-called friends have abandoned him to his terminal illness.<p>The theme that each person is an island and that we all truly die alone is persistent throughout.<p>Like Woolf (who was sexually abused as a child by her own step brothers), all the principal characters have major sexual identity issues. They do not know whether they are gay, straight or just asexual... and this causes some extremely awkward scenes that will make you squirm in your seat. They all behave as though they do not fit in their own bodies. While they know how to "play the game" to fit in with "normal" society, they are alien to it and play with the though of death as the "great escape" from the prison of what their lives have become.<p>This is a superb film, but  it is an experience that is not for the faint of heart.  Those who have lost a loved one to suicide will find no solace in this story, and those who are suffering from depression should avoid it altogether.  As someone who is not suffering from depression, I walked out of the movie feeling like a wet dish rag. <p>Fans of Kidman, Moore and Streep will not be disappointed. Toni Collette's performance, while brief, is also powerful. This is not a film you just see - it is an experience.</p></body></html>

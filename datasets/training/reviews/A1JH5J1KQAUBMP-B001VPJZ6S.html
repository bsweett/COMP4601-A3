<meta name="summary" content="Great cast & theme rise above flaws"></head><body><p>Five high school students who are representative of well-known stereotypes--the princess (Molly Ringwald), the brain (Michael Anthony Hall), the athlete (Emilio Estevez), the basket case (Ally Sheedy), and the criminal (Judd Nelson)--are sentenced to all-day Saturday detention in the school library together.  Wanting nothing to do with each other, they nevertheless begin to interact and, by the end of the day, they have learned a great deal about themselves and the others, completely shattering the concept of a stereotype.<br /><br />There's a 5-star movie here screaming to get out, as exemplified by the wonderful scene in which the kids just sit down on the floor and talk about themselves and challenge each others assumptions.  It's hampered by many lesser elements, such as one-dimensional adult characters and silly posing (such as the MTV flavored dance scenes, which are unrealistic and painfully bad).  Nevertheless, the excellent performances and that basic core of honesty about high school that manages on occasion to rise powerfully above the formula rescue the film./</p></body></html>

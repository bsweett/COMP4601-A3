<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly excellent addition to the "Legend" trilogy"></head><body><p>Everyone seemed disappointed in this movie (probably because it takes a pretty high attention span to really get into).  Another reviewer commented that it "doesn't stick closely to its' source material", and in a way this is true, but it in a way it isn't--the film is pretty grim and though the ending strays from the novel, it is not a disappointment.<br /><br />Richard Matheson was so displeased with the first version of his classic horror novel of the same name ("The Last Man On Earth" starring Vincent Price) that he changed his name on the film's credits to "Logan Swanson".  One can only imagine what he thought of Charlton Heston's "The Omega Man", which featured zombies with afros and sunglasses.  Both of these films, however, conveyed the sense of crushing loneliness which comes through in the novel (particularly the former).  I'm not sure it's possible to successfully adopt this book to screen without departing in some way from the author's uncompromising vision.<br /><br />Will Smith does a fantastically understated job as the unfortunate scientist Robert Neville, who seems to be the sole surviving member of the human race after a pernicious virus simultaneously wipes out the species and transforms them into degraded, parasitic creatures not dissimilar to mythological vampires.  Along with his dog Sam, he cruises around during the day and hides in his fortress-like apartment while they roam the streets looking for him.  The tension in this film is palpable enough to cut with a knife; the scene in which Sam unwisely runs into a very dark area, thereby sparking a confrontation between Neville and his once human foes, is nail biting and effective.  Smith brings across the psychical damage wrought by years of solitude and fear when he tearfully begs a mannequin to say hello to him, almost with the glimmer of a belief that it might indeed happen.  In nearly every way it is faithful to some of the most heart-wrenching events of the novel: Sam's transformation, for instance, into a rabid dog and what Neville has to do afterward.<br /><br />The irony of Neville being a feared, monstrous being from the perspective of these creatures and his natural inclinaton to see them the same way is not brought across with as much force as it was in "The Last Man" but nonetheless it is delivered powerfully.  Smith's Neville "donates his blood" (no pun intended) while igniting a grenade in a gesture of self-sacrifice that is not candy coated.  In some ways this is one of the best versions of the novel I have ever seen, and kudos to Will Smith for a great performance.</p></body></html>

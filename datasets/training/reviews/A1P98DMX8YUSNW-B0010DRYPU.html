<meta name="summary" content="It holds up ok, but overrated"></head><body><p>Like a lot of Clint Eastwood flicks, this one doesn't seem nearly as good almost 20 years after its release. Times were simpler back in 1992 when this won four Academy Awards, I guess. Today, it seems just okay, not the 'masterpiece' it was hailed as. I thought they said the same thing for "Flag of Our Fathers," or was that "Pretty Baby"? No, wait, the Dirty Harry series? Please. Gene Hackman gives a great performance as the brutal sheriff trying to keep his town gun-free. Morgan Freeman plays his gentle and wise buddy role, yet again. The kid who recruits those two is awful, and has never been heard from again, as far as I know. Richard Harris is kind of wasted as Bob, a killer who gets whomped along the way. The script was supposed to be some mumbo-jumbo about the futility of violence. Whatever. The writing isn't bad, but I would not call it classic. Eastwood delivers his trademark sneers and squints, but although he is portrayed as a retired killer turned gentle hog farmer, no one will be surprised when he returns to action during the final third of the film. Still entertaining, this one. Just don't get too worshipful.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Real King Arthur"></head><body><p>I did not see "King Arthur" when it was in theaters but I wish that I had seen it on a big screen.  To be truthful, having seen the trailers I was not sure about the casting or that the story would be interesting.  I was wrong on both counts.  What appeals to me about this story of King Arthur is that it goes against the romanticized stories of the Knights of the Round Table and the search for the Holy Grail.  This is the historic Arthur or Lucius Artorius Castus.  What is known about this legendary hero is that he defeated the Saxons and established control over a large part of England.  The story presented in the film has Arthur and his Sarmatian cavalry (recruited from the modern day area of Hungary) in the days before the fall of Rome as the only effective force that maintains law and order in what was once a Roman province.<br /><br />There is a round table in this Arthur, signifying the equality of the knights, which dismays Bishop when he sees he will not be given preferential treatment.  Guinevere, however, is not simply the object of Arthur's (and Lancelot's) affection but is a tribal warrior maiden; and Merlin in a tribal leader who is opposed to Arthur and the dwindling authority of Rome.  Keira Knightly, playing Guinevere, has come in for a good deal of mirth for her portrayal of a warrior rather than the traditional role of Arthur's Queen.  However, now that archaeological evidence has proved that there really were Amazons and we know that women fought as gladiators and, recently, even serving with the legions in Britain, it should not be so shocking a leap to have Guinevere as a warrior.  Although Ms. Knightly has scenes where she is the only woman fighting with men, there are also scenes in the final battle where she is one of several women.  It may seem odd that her body is painted blue (not just face-paint) but it is certainly true that tribal people did paint themselves.<br /><br />Clive Owen does a magnificent job playing Arthur and is well supported by Ioan Gruffudd (Lancelot), Mads Mikkelsen (Tristan), Hugh Dancy (Galahad), Ray Winstone (Bors) and Ray Stevenson (Dagonet).  I liked Keira Knightly and Stephen Dillane made Merlin an interesting opponent/ally.  My only complaint is that Hadrian's Wall looked a bit skimpy for it being the location of one of the forts.  There are massive doors but the fortifications are lacking.  The location (in Ireland) was well chosen and the costumes were designed with some accuracy in mind, although one of the Roman cavalry helmet reminded me more of Japanese samurai. King Arthur is a film that will hold your interest and, hopefully, make one think about the real Arthur.  The story is well-conceived and brought to life by great actors; it is a film that deserves far more attention.</p></body></html>

The stories were collected in trade paperbacks with seven graphic novel that revolve around the people of Basin City aka "Sin City".  Known for it's use of primary colors of black, white and red, the graphic novel would win many fans over for its dark and violent tone but storytelling crafted by Frank Miller known for his awesome work on the "Batman" and "Daredevil: The Man Without Fear" comic books.<br /><br />In 2005, Robert Rodriguez, a fan of the graphic novels wanted to make a film based on "SIN CITY" but if only Frank Miller jumped on aboard.  After seeing test footage by Frank Miller, it was enough to entice the creator to become co-director of the film and in the end, earned over $158 million worldwide in theater receipts.<br /><br />In 2005, two DVD versions were released and now, a special 2-disc Blu-ray version which includes the original theatrical and the "recut, extended, unrated" version is set for an April 21, 2009 and all I can say is that this release blows away the DVD versions and easily among the top 10, if not, the top 5 Blu-ray's produced thus far.<br /><br />So, does "Frank Miller's SIN CITY" achieve perfection on Blu-ray?  Read on.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"Frank Miller's SIN CITY" is a film that is shot entirely digital via green screen.  The digital recreations of Sin City just look dark, grimy but in a technical sense, quite magnificent in capturing Frank Miller's dark and corrupted city with its blacks, whites and reds.<br /><br />The video which is presented in 1080p (with an aspect ratio of 1:85:1) is just absolutely beautiful as you can see skin pores to absolute detail on the talent but what is more impressive is how digital and realism comes together in harmony.  What was more shocking (which you learn from the special features), in certain scenes which you thought talent were acting with other talent, they weren't.  Footage of an actor may have been shot eight months ago and then the character that is interacting with another character is shot much later and all work done in post-production.<br /><br />A perfect example is in "That Yellow Bastard (Part 2)" in which Shellie (Brittany Murphy) and Hartigan (Bruce Willis) are interacting but in reality, the two individual scenes were shot months from each other.  It's just amazing how everything seems so fluid.<br /><br />The picture quality is just magnificent.  It's one thing to watch this on DVD and say how beautiful the film looks but when you watch it and see it on High Definition, it just blows away the picture quality of the DVD.  Granted, this film doesn't have as many colors as top tier Blu-ray films such as "Transformers" or even "Quantum of Solace" but using the dark grays and blacks with the whites and reds, this film looks great.<br /><br />As for audio, again this Blu-ray release meets perfection.  The English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48kHz/24-bit) is just incredible.  From the action scenes to the engines of the cars, you literally feel the noise around you.  And at the end with Alba and Willis's character, nice touch of the low level bass as your subwoofer just beats.  The audio is just great to listen to and the clarity of the dialogue, music and special effects were well done.<br /><br />If you think the theatrical and even the unrated, recut edition sound good, there is also an audio track to listen to a live recording of the audience at the Texas premiere which sounds great too (I can only hope more Blu-ray releases include that feature).<br /><br />Overall, "Frank Miller's SIN CITY" achieves perfection for picture and audio quality.  Just magnificent!<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />With Audio and Video reaching perfection, this Blu-ray release does not slouch in special features at all.  You are definitely getting your money's worth with so many features included.  Features such as:<br /><br />DISC 1: Disc One (Theatrical Cut) Features: This disc gives you five different reasons to re-watch the original theatrical version of the film and all are worth it!<br /><br />  * All new Cine-Explore - Innovative Blu-ray technology allows viewers to experience a uniquely interactive visual commentary that pushes the envelope. When selected, see picture-in-picture green screen footage and original art synced with the filmmakers' commentary.  This is optional and a nice touch.<br />  * 2.0 Commentary with Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller - The commentary between Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller is pretty cool. Miller has lived "SIN CITY", he knows the ins and outs to the city and its characters, so it was great to have this commentary with both men.  But mostly for Miller's perspective and knowledge.  Very cool commentary.<br />  * 2.0 Commentary with Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino - Tarentino shot the burial/driving scene for "The BIG FAT KILL", so he's pretty much in and out for the commentary.  Most of the commentary is Robert Rodriguez.  Where the first commentary, it was Miller driven, this one is Rodriguez driven and when the the time comes, you hear Tarentino chime in.  But it's an interesting commentary as Tarantino doesn't like shooting in digital but because it's a Frank Miller film based on a popular Frank Miller story, he gave it a chance and enjoyed the experience.<br />  * 5.1 Audio Track Featuring a Recording of the Austin Audience Reaction - Definitely a fun addition as you watch the film with the actual audience track with people cheering, laughing and just reactions during the entire film.  Sounds great and really gave me another reason to watch the film again and enjoy it.  Great addition to this release!<br /><br />DISC TWO:  This disc includes the "Unrated, Recut Extended Version" which has 23 extra minutes and the bulk of the special features.<br /><br />  * All new "Kill `em Good" Interactive Comic Book - Dive into a visually stunning interactive game that puts you in the driver's seat. Exploiting the Blu-ray format in ways never before seen, you finish the story - with guns blazing!  For a game, I was quite impressed by the audio quality.  Very well done game and using the graphic novels and artwork for an interactive comic book.  Very nice addition to this Blu-ray release!<br />  * Four Chapters: The unrated, recut version are viewed as separate films.  There are no chapter stops, so you can watch these separate chapters with new, additional footage.<br /><br />o Chapter One- That Yellow Bastard<br /><br />o Chapter Two- The Customer Is Always Right<br /><br />o Chapter Three- The Hard Goodbye<br /><br />o Chapter Four- The Big Fat Kill<br /><br />  * Rodriguez Special Features:<br /><br />o 15-Minute Film School - (15 min.) Robert Rodriguez is known for his past DVD releases of teaching the filmmaker of tips of how he accomplished scenes on a budget.  This time around, Rodriguez uses "SIN CITY" to show how things are done via green screen but how he did certain things to stay within budget of the film.<br /><br />o All Green Screen Version - (12:33) This is the entire film sped up in 800% but a good way to see how everything was shot via green screen.<br />o The Long Take - (14:42) This scene shows how Quentin Tarentino shot the driving scene between Dwight (Clive Owen) and Jackie Boy (Benicio del Toro).  Very interesting how this take is long and these guys are just sitting in the car for long periods of time. Interesting perspective on filmmaking with these two talented individuals.<br />o Sin City: Live in Concert- (7:15) During a break in Texas, Bruce Willis & The Accelerators perform for charity and cast of "Frank Miller's SIN CITY" and "Scanner Darkly" hook up and enjoy the performance.<br />o 10-Minute Cooking School - (6:21) Director Robert Rodriguez is often working late in the early morning and when he gets the munchies, he loves his breakfast tacos.  So, he shows you how to make them.<br /><br />* How It Went Down: Convincing Frank Miller To Make The Film - (5:40) What it took for Robert Rodriguez to convince Frank Miller to make "SIN CITY" to a movie.  Interviews with both men.<br />* Special Guest Director: Quentin Tarantino - (7:19) Interviews with Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez.  How Rodriguez was able to convince Tarantino to direct a spot.<br />* A Hard Top With A Decent Engine: The Cars of Sin City - (7:34) Interviews with Cecil D. Evans (Transportation Coordinator) of finding the vehicles from the graphic novels for the film.  Miller owns hundreds of die cast vehicles and used those as reference for his graphic novels.  Thus, Evans would go throughout Texas and asking owners to borrow cars for a few days or weeks such as Nancy's 57 Chevy Nomad, Wendy's `55 Porsche Spyder, Dwight's `55 Cadillac and more.<br />* Booze, Broads, and Guns: The Props of Sin City - (10:57) Interviews with Steve Joyner (Prop Master) and how he followed the "Booze, Broads and Guns" mentality of the film.  How certain props looked as real as the original to finding the right bow from the graphic novel in real life and obtaining it and using it for the film.<br />* Making the Monsters: Special Effects Make-up - (9:04) Interviews with Grig Nicotero (Special Motion Video Effects Supervisor) and creating the makeup for characters such as Marv, Jackie Boy and Yellow Bastard.<br />* Trench Coats & Fishnets: The Costumes of Sin City - (7:34) Interview with Mona Proctor (Costume Supervisor) going through the various costumes especially for the women like Gail (Rosario Dawson) who wore next to nothing.  Very informative.<br />* Teaser & Theatrical Trailer - The Teaser trailer is 2:07 minutes and the official trailer is at 1:49.<br /><br />I've owned the previous two DVD version of "Frank Miller's SIN CITY" but watching this on Blu-ray, I'm just amazed how much  of a difference High Definition really makes this film look and sound so incredible.<br /><br />The picture quality and the vibrancy of the reds and golds, the audio quality of weapons, cars and violence with wonderful DTS-HD audio going all around you.  This film is just right up there for one of the best releases on Blu-ray thus far.<br /><br />Again, I understand that other films such as "TRANSFORMERS" and "Quantum of Solace" which were shot outdoors looked incredible while "Frank Miller's SIN CITY" is digital throughout in terms of the cityscape and the overall atmosphere of the city.<br /><br />And suffice to say, both Blu-ray discs are just packed full of special features and enough to keep fans busy.  The first disc alone gives you five ways to watch the film and each reason is just fantastic (especially if you are a big fan of the film and the graphic novels).  The second disc was a great touch to add an unrated, recut version.<br /><br />It would have been nice to have the full theatrical film with the newer footage added to it but overall, the second disc gives you individual chapters and yet again, another way to enjoy this film.<br /><br />As for parents who wonder if this film based on a comic book is family friendly, despite the fact that blood is seen in various colors, the film is excessively violent and has its share of nudity.  So, despite Miller's work with the "Batman" and "Daredevil" comic books, "SIN CITY" is not a film you want to have your kids watching.<br /><br />In the end, I really enjoyed the film and the Blu-ray release.  Sure, it's over-the-top and both Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino have had their share of over-the-top films.  But there are few graphic novels that I have wanted to see in film and so, seeing "SIN CITY" as a film and with Miller involved and thus making sure the film is faithful to the graphic novels was awesome.  And just kudos to Robert Rodriguez who allowed Frank Miller to fully be in control of the film and working together with him and coming up with this unique and stylish film, the two work great together and I just hope to see a future collaboration with both men again.<br /><br />Finding a Blu-ray release that is just perfect in all four categories of film, video, audio and special features is quite rare.  Typically you get two out of four but in the case of "Frank Miller's SIN CITY", this release is just perfect.<br /><br />Videophiles and audiophiles are just going to love this release while fans of the film are just going to go nuts over the amount of content included on both Blu-ray discs.<br /><br />"Frank Miller's SIN CITY" is perfect and highly, highly recommended!

First off, I have to congratulate Malcolm McDowell for his twisted and genius performance, didn't know he had it in him. The problem with this film is the grotesque nudity and violent rape scenes, less is more. Stanley Kubrick was a good director but he always had the same formula, show more skin. This film is just too trippy for me, but hey if you're into that then you will love this film.</p></body></html>

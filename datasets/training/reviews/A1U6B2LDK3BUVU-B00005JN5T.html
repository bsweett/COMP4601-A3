<meta name="summary" content="Loosen up, America"></head><body><p>I'd give this a low three stars or a high two stars.  It's called a comedy, I suppose, but it really isn't funny.  There are very few laughs in it.  It's more of a human interest story.  Plus, it plays out the American right wing-left wing thing.<br /><br />The left wingers are Dustin Hoffman, Barbara Streisand, and Ben Stiller, a married couple and their son.  They are pointedly Jewish.  There is really only one right winger in the story, Robert DeNiro, playing a very uptight retired CIA agent.<br /><br />The moral of the story is that right wingers are much too uptight and should loosen up and have sex with their wives.<br /><br />The first half of the movie was just too un-funny.  The last half wasn't funny either, but it was more "human interest" and was okay.<br /><br />Take a potentially funny scene like a man trying to breast feed a little baby by actually putting on a fake breast that can squirt milk.  Charlie Chaplin would have made it hysterical, if it had been okay to do in his day, and perhaps he would have found a way to pull it off acceptably for his audience.  Richard Pryor and Chris Rock would have made it funny too.  So would Red Skelton, most likely.  Groucho Marx would have had us rolling.  I think he was about the funniest man of the last century.  But DeNiro really isn't a comedian, and when he does it I'm not laughing.<br /><br />It's tough to make someone laugh when the script has you being a robotic tight-butt.<br /><br />The movie is basically about telling conservative America to loosen up like a liberal Jewish family.  Okay, good.  Nothing wrong with loosening up a little.<br /><br />DeNiro's dramatic work is better than his comedic work.  I don't think of Ben Stiller as one of the giants of comedy, though he is nowhere near as annoying as that guy who plays Bigelow the Gigolo, or that annoying guy from Saty Nite Live who does the No No No commercials (what's in your wallet?), or that constantly complaining and overly macho Denis Leary who has yet to do anything remotely funny, and who is about as funny as smacking a girl in the teeth.  You want funny?  Try Rodney Dangerfield, or Sam Kinison.  Now that's funny.<br /><br />But the cast also has Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, two very talented comedic actors, so how can it miss?  Dustin Hoffman can do anything.  He is just a damn capable performer, and if I see that he is in something, I know it was taken seriously and is worth a look.  He even made that wooden chunk of cardboard Tom Cruise into something once.</p></body></html>

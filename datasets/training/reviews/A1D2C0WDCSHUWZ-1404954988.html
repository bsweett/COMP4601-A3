<meta name="summary" content="Spanglish smanglish"></head><body><p>Hell hath no fury like a filmmaker scorned, apparently. At least that's what seems to be going on with James L. Brooks -- his latest film "Spanglish" feels like a tirade against a despised ex (which, rumor has it, it is). Paz Vega injects a bit of likability into the plot, but this comedy just seems like a bitter ride into marital dysfunction.<br /><br />Flor (Paz Vega) and her daughter emigrate to the United States, hoping for a better life. They find employment for Jamie Oliver-like John Clasky (Adam Sandler) and his neurotic wife Deborah (Tea Leoni), who have a very weird marriage -- he is a loving husband and father, with too much pressure; she is a screeching harridan who bugs her pudgy daughter to lose weight.<br /><br />Flor doesn't speak English, and the Claskys don't speak Spanish; her bilingual child has to translate for them. But a friendship starts to bloom between Flor and John, as Deborah starts to woo Flor's pretty young daughter away from her, and alienates her own daughter.<br /><br />A comedy that bangs you over the head with a message is bad enough. A comedy that just bangs you over the head is even worse. This is another one of the mature Adam Sandler movies -- you know, the ones where he is called on to play a non-dolt. Unfortunately, this movie isn't worthy of such an attempt.<br /><br />While the movie technically revolves around Flor and John's lives, the obnoxious self-absorbed Deborah dominates the plot. If you can get past Brooks' ridiculous bitterness, there actually a smothered message in the story about Flor. Unfortunately, it seems to be that if a person immigrates to the US, they shouldn't consider it "their" country, or let their kids do so. The writing has a few good lines (especially from Deborah's alcoholic mother), but stays tepid most of the time.<br /><br />Tea Leoni isn't a terribly good actress, but she's given a positively loathsome character in Deborah -- she's obsessed with her body, ignorant of others' feelings, and obnoxious even in the bedroom. (Yes, Brooks takes us THERE) Sandler's so-so performance is overshadowed by Leoni's harpy performance, especially since you can't see why he's such a devoted husband. Only Paz Vega gives a performance of real nuance and ability.<br /><br />The bile that spews all over "Spanglish" keeps it from being a moderately charming love/family comedy. Save your issues for your therapist, John. They don't make for good movies.</p></body></html>

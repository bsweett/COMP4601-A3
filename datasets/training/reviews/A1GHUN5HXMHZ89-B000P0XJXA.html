Fortunately I rented it and now I'm here to buy it. Exceptionally taut and rapid developing story never lets up. You will feel you are with Val Kilmer training special forces recruits and then trailing the disappearance of a young girl. Interviews with suspects quickly lead them to a slave trade and then preparation for an overseas flight to take down the gang. News of her death while yachting doesn't ring true when his partner indicates he saw signs of her at the entry point of the slave trade. You best sit tight and pause if you have to leave the room because you will not want to miss a minute of this action thriller. I for one was never sure what to expect next and you may find yourself wondering who Kilmer will kill including his team. I highly recommend it. Good quality DVD with standard extras.

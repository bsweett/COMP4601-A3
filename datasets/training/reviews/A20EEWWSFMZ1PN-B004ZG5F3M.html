<meta name="summary" content=""Babette's Feast" with 'Like Water for Chocolate" feel"></head><body><p>This is a unique movie with features and messages portrayed in "Babette's Feast (1988)" and "Like Water for Chocolate (1993)".<br /><br />The story has been told many ways. Yet this movie is still unique in its presentation. We get to visit with our favorite actors and they do such a good job that they do not overwhelm the characters. I especially liked Alfred Molina who played a similar role in "Enchanted April (1992)" as someone that really was not a bad person; he was just misunderstood or has a misunderstanding and comes around later to be really a good guy.<br /><br />Like "Babette's Feast", everyone is supposed to shun Vianne Rocher who goes out of her way to help people. And like "Like Water for Chocolate" the movie has a mystical feel.<br /><br />Basic story is a town where everyone knows their place and duty is visited by a north wind caring a mysterious woman and her daughter. Their present's wakes up the people from their organized existence.<br /><br />The DVD has all the DVD goodies that you are looking for, such as voice over, deleted scenes etc. And they do not force the coming attractions on you.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000053VBK">Babette's Feast</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Films of 2009"></head><body><p>Quentin Tarantino had long spoken of his "war epic" that he had been working on and in late 2008, he unexpectedly announced that he had commenced filming and wanted to release it at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. Upon its debut, it became the highest-grossing film of his career, opened to rave reviews, and the typical fanfare that greets just about any Tarantino film. Inglourious Basterds is not a war epic in the traditional sense...It's a war fantasy, in which Tarantino doesn't let the constraints of reality keep him from telling the story he wishes to tell. It's a large-scale epic, separated into five chapters, with a large cast, and a great villain.<br /><br />Chapter one is called "Once Upon a Time...In Nazi-Occupied France." Colonel Hans Landa of the SS (Christoph Waltz), nicknamed "the Jew Hunter," stops by the dairy farm of Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet) to inquire about a missing family of Jews whom Landa believes LaPadite is hiding in his home. This is an explosive opening scene, beautifully shot by cinematographer Robert Richardson, and absolutely bristling with suspense. The banter between Waltz and Menochet, coupled with the subtle musical score is a brilliant example of filmmaking, as well as a great way to establish the character Hans Landa. Meanwhile, we have the brief and understated performance by Menochet. In the scheme of things, with as many speaking roles as this movie has, Menochet has a relatively insignificant role in the film, and yet he has a rather remarkable impact. He lets us in to empathize with him as Landa slowly breaks him down.<br /><br />Chapter two introduces us to the "Basterds," a group whose mission is to spread fear throughout the German military by ruthlessly killing Nazi's. They're lead by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), who leads the colorful characters through Germany, killing and scalping any Nazi's they come across. They've become so feared by the German military, even Hitler is aware of them.<br /><br />While there are 5 chapters, its only chapter three I'm going to elaborate any further on...This chapter, entitled "German Night in Paris," introduces us to Shosanna (Melanie Laurent), the surviving Jewish girl of chapter one, who operates a cinema in France under an assumed name. Shosanna is approached by Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), a celebrated German war hero, who asks Shosanna to host a movie premiere of his movie "Nation's Pride," a movie premiere that will be attended by the top powers of the Third Reich, including Hitler himself.<br /><br />Of course, there are many more characters and many more actors. In setting up his film with chapters, Tarantino has made a film that, overall, has more of an episodic nature than a cohesive story. There is no main character in the film and many of the film's characters never meet each other and, really, it's only Hans Landa that really holds it all together. Don't be fooled by the theatrical trailers which portray the "Basterds" as the main characters...They actually have a relatively small amount of screen time. Other actors include the lovely Diane Kruger as Bridget von Hammersmark, a German actress who's serving as a spy for the British. A surprising appearance by Mike Myers (yes, Austin Powers himself) has bothered some and I would have preferred a different choice myself, but he doesn't exactly bother me. It's just so noticeably Myers and he's so campy with his role it sort of breaks the spell woven by Inglourious Basterds momentarily.<br /><br />Many of this film's detractors cite it's casting much of the time, particularly Myers and director Eli Roth as the Basterds' Bear Jew. Roth is convincing physically as the Bear Jew and the maniacal look in his eyes (he's probably stoned) work well, but whenever he's required to speak (not very often) I didn't buy it. But he doesn't ruin the film by any stretch and, yes, he likely only got cast because he's friends with Tarantino...But, oh well. He does a decent job. Pitt is fantastic as Lt. Aldo Raine and it's his larger-than-life persona that makes this performance so effective and entertaining. If Pitt is campy in the role, it just fits well into the whole scheme of things. Many director's want you to suspend your disbelief and accept a film as a reality...Tarantino wants you to know you're watching a movie. Pitt will not win an Oscar for his performance, but I found his portrayal both compulsively watchable and hilarious. Finally, Waltz plays Hans Landa so menacingly he deserves all the critical accolades his performance has been met with. Waltz creates such a thoroughly evil, gleeful sociopathic character that is one of Tarantino's greatest creations. Waltz was a German television actor that Tarantino picked for the role and I haven't seen a more impressive supporting performance this year.<br /><br />The dialogue is typical Tarantino ("We ain't in the prisoner-takin' business, we in the killin' Nazi business and, cousin, business is a boomin'"), although it's worth noting that much of the dialogue is subtitled. This surprised me when I first saw the film and I can imagine some will be angered by this. A large majority of the film is in a language other than English, but you can still feel the effect of Tarantino's dialogue.<br /><br />Also very impressive and a huge component of the film is its musical score; one that only Tarantino would use for a World War II epic. Tarantino has always had a gift for picking music for his film and this film is no exception. Despite many of Tarantino's flourishes, this film has the least Tarantino-like feel to it, although I can't quite put my finger on why.<br /><br />This is not a film for everyone and even fans of war movies and/or Tarantino will be disappointed by it. It's not a perfect film and, while I think it's a great film, I wonder if it would've been greater had Tarantino not rushed into making it.  It's got a brilliant opening scene and a terrific ending (whether it makes complete sense or not) and it further cements Tarantino's status as one of Hollywood's greatest film directors. Inglourious Basterds is one of the best, most entertaining films of 2009; a celebration of cinema and what makes movies so great.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></body></html>

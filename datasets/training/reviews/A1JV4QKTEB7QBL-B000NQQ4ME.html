<meta name="summary" content="Got Sacrifice?"></head><body><p>Mel Gibson's 2006 film Apocalypto contains all the essential elements of the typical epic drama: over 2 hours of nonstop action where an unassuming hero, the young family man Jaguar Paw, played excellently by Rudy Youngblood, finds himself in a vicarious situation where his home and hearth are threatened and he is forced to venture out from what he knows in order to protect and defend what he holds dear.<br /><br />As a Mayan warrior living at the time of the conquistador arrival in the New World, Jaguar Paw is familiar with the ways of the Yucatan jungle where he and his ancestors have lived comfortably for generations.  The audience first sees him with his fellow hunters and shares in the easy fellowship that exists in the village.  We admire the loving relationship that identifies him as a father and husband, but most of all it is that Rousseau-ian wild child, hanging-around-without any-clothes-in-the-forest innocence that we covet.  Jaguar Paw seems to have it all; that is until another Mayan contingency plunders through his village, kills the undesirables and transports JP with other potential slaves and human sacrifices to the Temple of the feathered-snake god, Kukulcan, in the central Mayan metroplex of Chichen Itza.<br /><br />Gibson films with amazing authenticity - his depiction of the internal and external suffering of JP and his village counterparts creates gut-wrenching moments of the sort he is famous for in Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ.  We not only feel the pain, we live through the exhilaration generated when Gibson utilizes the universal power of myth where the hero travels within a mythical woods fraught with peril leading to an emotionally and physically transcendental initiation that allows him to not only combat the forces of evil, but return to his loved ones fully transformed.<br /><br />Is Gibson merely reenacting the mythical hero's journey or is he simply employing a powerful story to underline a contemporary message?  Apparently he feels strongly enough about whatever the significance is to finance both JP's and JC's (The Passion of the Christ) metamorphosis with personal funds.  However, facilitating graphically painful violence, torture and almost horror movie techniques, he, at times, over illustrates his point.  Beneath all the gore, what is he depicting---man's penchant for inhumanity or his own seemingly insatiable desire to photograph it? Is he using the blood spectacle to mesmerize and entertain the crowd not unlike the emperors of Rome used the battles to the death in the coliseum?  Or does he, like some ancient shaman believe that something purifying and spiritual is born from the mythic "the-king-must-die" blood sacrifice?  Like the front piece to the film, historian Will Durant's quotation, "A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within," and the actual depiction of the debauched sickness ensuing from the lower levels of the Mayan society to the garish strangeness of the upper classes, Gibson firstly drives home the idea that as a particular society evolves it becomes jaded by its own sophistication.  What is, at one time, new and exciting, degenerates into old and boring necessitating the exploration of newer and better thrills to achieve a sense of satisfaction.<br /><br />Gibson's heroes differ from the usual Campbell heroes of a thousand faces that need the quest to mature and redefine their values. Their morality and goodness stands firm and in terms of development they remain the same from start to finish.  From the vantage point of the audience, pandemonium reigns --- the sights and sounds of the debauched society evokes that alien quality George Lukas used so well in Star Wars when Luke Skywalker infiltrates the cosmic bar and innocence personified encounters an assortment of cynical alien rou&eacute;s.  We sense peace only in the major characters.  Yes, they are terrorized by the ordeal they are about to undergo, but spiritually they remain steadfast.  Instead, they are the only characters that by their stability and quiet resolve fill the hole carved out by the heart of darkness.<br /><br />Each of Gibson's major characters undergoes his trial by fire by understanding fully that his objective has little to do with the actual ordeal and all to do with their sense of self and their responsibility to their family and home. The cultures he depicts have degraded into abysses of the spiritual where the accumulation of wealth naturally erodes be they ancient Rome in the time of Christ (Passion of the Christ), the British subjection of Scotland (Braveheart) and now in Apocalypto the Mayan Empire around the time when the old world collided with the new.  Those who can still be saved need some kind of mythic sacrificial figure that personifies the values of hearth and home.<br /><br />So, okay, Mel, I get it . . . we all are accidental participants in a corrupt society---desensitized by our own complexity, in dire need of a sacrificial lamb to reconnect us with the all important simple things that life unfolds and ultimately death and the after-life reveals.<br /><br />Bottom line? Mel Gibson's Apocalypto may provide a colorful and raucous panoramic view of a long gone civilization, but it also exemplifies the epic tale of Jungian archetypes where trial by fire transforms and drives the representative hero to extraordinary action.  Bloody in parts, it typifies that which Mel has become famous:  providing a sacrificial lamb that elevates hope and common good for the masses.

<meta name="summary" content="Great `adult' holiday comedy."></head><body><p>As far as romantic comedies goes, for the most part `Love Actually' nails it.  The only problem I have with this film is that it covers the lives of so many young lovers that no one is truly explored or explained, there's just simply not enough time.<br /><br />But that aside, the cast is truly talented and make for a wonderfully delightful time.  Bill Nighy comes to mind right off bat as a real reason to watch this film, for his portrayal of Billy Mack, the washed up rock star vying for a second chance is just utterly hysterical.<br /><br />As love triangles are formed, new love blossoms and lasting love begins to fade, a cast that includes Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Keira Knightly, Hugh Grant, Martine McCutcheon, Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman deliver laughs and smiles that are sure to please the viewer.<br /><br />Some of the characters and relationships could have been axed to provide stronger storylines for key characters, but all in all this is a great slice of entertainment and not a bad way to spend some time.</p></body></html>

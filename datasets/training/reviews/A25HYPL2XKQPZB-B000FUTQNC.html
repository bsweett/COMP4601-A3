<meta name="summary" content="Mildly entertaining, mildly supsensful"></head><body><p>This is a dull movie, and after you watch it, you'll see why it was released in February.  Starring Harrison Ford, the movie sets itself up and markets itself as a thriller with Ford, the computer expert having to break through the own security he set up to save his family.<br /><br />There's nothing high tech at all about this film.  A group of bad guys kidnap's Ford's family and won't release them until Ford does what they want him to do.  Ford easily does what they want but things go wrong along the way.  Now Ford has to find out where the bad guys are and save his family.<br /><br />The drama comes from Ford's interaction with his co-workers. (Chloe from "24" is his secretary)  Ford is being followed by the bad guys, a menacing Paul Bettany, and has to watch every move he makes.<br /><br />About the only good part of this movie is watching Ford act, and he didn't even do a great job.  But hey, it's Harrison Ford, so I'll watch.  The suspense nor the characters never once grabbed me, and the plot was about as straight forward as they come.  Still, not a bad rental, but probably not one for the at home collection.</p></body></html>

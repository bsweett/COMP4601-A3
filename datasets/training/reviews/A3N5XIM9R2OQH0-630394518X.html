<meta name="summary" content="A modern classic"></head><body><p>Brilliant mainstream movies seem to be increasingly rare these days, but "Seven" is surely one that will stand the test of time.  Direcotr David Fincher, with help from a terrific ensemble cast, crafted a dark, uncompromising look at the moral failings of contemporary American society.  This is not a happy movie, and you won't feel any better after watching it, but it'll certainly make you think.  On one level, "Seven" is a mystery/suspense movie, and an excellent one at that.  The plot, which I'm sure most are familiar with by now, concerns two cops, Brad Pitt's youthful Mills and Morgan Freeman's aging Somerset, on the trail of a serial killer.  As the movie develops, it turns out that the killer is basing his murders on the seven deadly sins, and finding a fiendish way to turn each one against the sinner.  Although this concept is exceedingly clever, it wouldn't make a classic movie on its own.  What elevates "Seven" above the heap is that it exploits the allegorical potential of its subject to the fullest.  More than just a simple crime drama, "Seven" is a modern morality tale for our troubled times.  The lead characters, Mills and Somerset, become representatives for two competing viewpoints.  The young Mills still thinks he can make a difference through his work, but the soon-to-retire Somerset has allowed himself to become jaded by the constant apathy he sees in society.  Unfortunately, it seems that Somerset's view has the weight of evidence behind it.  And then there's the killer, played in truly unsettling fashion by Kevin Spacey (back when he was still an excellent character actor and not a failed leading man).  Spacey's John Doe doesn't show up until there's about a half-hour left in the movie, but during his brief role he OWNS the screen.  When he explains the rationale behind his killings, it's pretty near impossible not to think about what he says.  Fincher's noirish direction tops it all off, creating a dark and oppressive atmosphere that perfectly complements the movie's subject matter.  If you're anything like me, you'll be rather depressed after watching "Seven," but you'll be wiser for it.</p></body></html>

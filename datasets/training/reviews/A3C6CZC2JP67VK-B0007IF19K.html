I was also impressed with director Taylor Hackford's choice to balance Ray's personal tragedies and personal life with his music careers. Many musical biographies tend to focus more on the personal side, but 'Ray' lets us into business meetings, contract discussions, label changes and in this film makes Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler important characters in the film. I also liked how the film addressed the groundbreaking musical choices Ray made without being heavy handed.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx truly deserved that Oscar, congratulation. Kerry Washington, Regina King, and Sharon Warren (who plays Ray's mother, Aretha)  performances are just integral to the film because Ray was certainly not a perfect person as the film shows, and their characters each bring out a different side in Ray, and the actors each bring a different side out of Jamie Foxx. Kerry Washington is fabulous as Della Bea, Ray's long suffering and put-upon wife. The scene when she explains to Ray that their newborn son is not a gift from her to him and how his life on the road must not find its way in the home she is making for their family is powerful and the scene when Ray tells her of the death of Margie Hendrix is just as stunning. Washington is an incredible actress and "Ray" lets her shine!<br /><br />Regina King was fantastic on this role. Her Margie Hendrix is a blistering hybrid of passion, weakness, love and compassion, and every emotion is firmly etched on King's face. The "Hit the Road Jack" scene is so raw and painful, and King matches Foxx's performance emotion for emotion, word for word, pain for pain, blues for blues. Regina King is a miracle worker, and it is high time she is acknowledged for the incredible work she is contributing to American film. Another scene that moved me was when Ray's character is a child and learns to cope with being blind, while his mother observes. It is one of the most striking scenes.<br /><br />The story was very powerful and endearing. It has captured the essence of a true American Icon and legend. See the film and enjoy the music!</p></body></html>

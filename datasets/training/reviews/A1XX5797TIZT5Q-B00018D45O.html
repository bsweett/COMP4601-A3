The original Chainsaw was, arguably, one of two horror films (the other being Night of the Living Dead) which had brought the genre into the modern age, making it more brutal, more realistic, and less about fantastical monsters than about horrifying human beings who do exist.  In other words, completing the journey begun by Hitchcock's Psycho, the granddaddy of them all.  The original Chainsaw distinguished itself by its almost complete lack of plot, logic, likeable characters and human drama, while being unmatched in terms of physical impact.  While better horror films have certainly been made (the original Dawn of the Dead, for example), none have been more terrifying.<br /><br />There's a reason why very few of the acknowledged modern-horror classics -- Night of the Living Dead, the original Dawn, Halloween, the original Chainsaw -- were made within the Hollywood system.  When you throw a large amount of budget at a horror film, it often has the inexplicably strange effect of diluting the horror of the film -- just witness George A. Romero's Day of the Dead, the most expensive of his zombie trilogy -- because a higher budget tends to mean more reservations about content, censorship, script sophistication...and the fact that an overly slick look, usually what happens when you raise the budget, just isn't as sick or as horrifying as a film that looks real and rough.<br /><br />Given this adage, I was surprised that this remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre wasn't the complete bust I'd expected it to be.  Sure, I laughed through about half the film, at the commercial-like photography, the lazy and incredibly generic score, the moralizing, the attempts at plot twists, and worst of all the opening, which gives us far too much information we don't need to know.  Somewhere along the line, though, the film eventually got something right -- the insane, unrelenting forward thrust that had made the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre so skeletal yet memorable.<br /><br />This remake is like the misconceptions about the original film made into reality.  The original Chainsaw, despite its ultraviolent reputation, was actually quite devoid of gore.  It does its psychological horror on the audience by virtue of a brutal pacing and sensory assault, but very little explicit violence was shown.  This remake, on the other hand, frequently shows graphic dismemberment and eviscerations.  While this is certainly a less subtle strategy than the original, it works in its own way, delivering the physical threat so often missing from modern horror films.  This remake works best when it's not trying to emulate its predecessor.  The aforementioned opening, complete with "police footage", is just silly, nothing compared to the bare-bones narration that had opened the original, and the two sequences that copy the original Chainsaw -- Leatherface dragging his first victim, and the chase through the woods -- pale alongside the original.  But the new gore sequences work in themselves, and once you survive the useless plot developments of the first act and a half, you get the visceral jolts a horror film is supposed to deliver.<br /><br />Jessica Biel gives her all here, faring much better than the average modern horror actress in conveying animalistic terror.  I was also amused to see Eric Balfour (Milo in the TV series 24) playing her ill-fated boyfriend.  However, the screenwriters went a little too far with the villains, nearly doubling the size of the cannibal clan, and trying to give Leatherface and his family a psychological motivation (Leatherface's disfigurement) is utterly futile.  It's like the final police-station scene of Psycho, or when the Halloween films started giving Michael Myers a reason to kill -- brainless exposition that a horror audience doesn't need.<br /><br />I was surprised to find myself becoming engaged after 25 minutes of wishing this film were over.  So while this new Texas Chainsaw Massacre doesn't match up to the original, it has some definite strong points of its own.</p></body></html>

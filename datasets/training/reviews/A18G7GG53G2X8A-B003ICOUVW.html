Let's start with Rick Heinrichs, the production designer; his sets evoke a gothic style that may not be realistic, but is an absolute pleasure to look at. Then there's Rick Baker, who has proven time and time again that he's a master at makeup effects; his werewolf designs are convincingly primal, all ghoulish facial contortions and untamed tufts of fur. There's also Shelly Johnson, whose shadowy cinematography brilliantly captures the essence of the horror genre. Milena Canonero's costumes are effectively drab. Danny Elfman's score is wonderfully moody. From a technical point of view, this movie is a triumph.<br /><br />But as a story, it's a serious let down. I find this odd, since the basic plot is the same as the original 1941 film written by Curt Siodmak. I'm sure director Joe Johnston and writers Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self had the best of intentions, but unfortunately, they let their film fall victim to weak character development, unresolved subplots, and scenes that place gore above genuine fright. It's an updated film, alright - for audiences that favor heavy action and elaborate death scenes. Like so many remakes that have come before it, "The Wolfman" takes a neat idea and turns it into a shallow spectacle of art direction and special effects.<br /><br />The plot: In the year 1891, Shakespearean actor Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) returns from New York to England when he learns of the death of his brother, Ben. For reasons I won't reveal, Lawrence has kept himself distant from his family, especially his father, Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins), an unaffectionate man who lives in a sprawling estate so dreary, it's a wonder it isn't teeming with ghosts. When Lawrence gets a look at his brother's body, he's repulsed; Ben was ripped to shreds, either by a wild animal or a deranged lunatic. Prompted by his own grief - and by his brother's fianc&eacute;e, Gwen (Emily Blunt) - Lawrence takes it upon himself to get to the bottom of things.<br /><br />The discovery of a medallion on Ben's body leads Lawrence to a gypsy camp, where Ben had been acting as a liaison between them and the town. A mysterious old woman (Geraldine Chaplin) gives him the obligatory warning about an ancient curse, which is appropriate given the fact that tonight just happens to be a full moon. And that's right about the time a vicious werewolf attacks the camp, resulting in Lawrence getting bitten. You know what happens when a werewolf bites you during a full moon, don't you?<br /><br />Here enters Inspector Francis Aberline of Scotland Yard (Hugo Weaving), who has reason to believe that Lawrence is hiding something. Let's just say that the Talbots haven't been the happiest of families.<br /><br />The problems with this movie don't have much to do with the tone, although I must admit, the updated animal-attack scenes were a bit heavy handed with the gore. No, the real problems stem from the content, or rather, how the content was reinterpreted. Consider the inevitable romance between Lawrence and Gwen; while tragedy often times diminishes the capacity for overt emotions, the way these two regard each other is so low key that it's impossible to believe they would ever fall in love. It's never really explained why they fell in love in the first place. Maybe this has to do with pacing, since the final cut makes it seems as if they developed feelings over the course of one day.<br /><br />Some of the blame rests with the actors, or maybe with the way the actors were directed (it's hard to tell sometimes). Del Toro, an accomplished actor in all respects, plays Lawrence as an emotionless drone. He's quiet, monotone, and shows virtually no range - except, of course, for when he's transforming into a werewolf, at which point he's buried by computer graphics and makeup. Hopkins isn't much better; his character is a man of mystery, and yet he's so passive and matter-of-fact in his delivery that none of his revelations shock us. Not that it matters a great deal, since his secrets aren't all that plausible within the context of the story.<br /><br />It's sad when the technical achievements of a film upstage the story. There are moments of dazzling cinematic wizardry, such as when Lawrence hallucinates while under the influence of psychiatric drugs. You're amazed by the visuals, but you're also at a loss to explain how they're significant to the plot. To me, it all seemed like filler material, a way to compensate for a lack of imagination. Perhaps the film's troubled production is responsible; numerous reshoots and a rejection of Danny Elfman's score (which was subsequently used anyway) saw the original release date of November 2008 give way to February 2009, April 2009, and November 2009 before finally opening on February 12, 2010. With such long delays and drastic changes in direction, it's no wonder the end result is bit disappointing.</p></body></html>

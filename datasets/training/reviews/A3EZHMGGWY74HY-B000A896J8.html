<meta name="summary" content="A DVD that you need in your collection!"></head><body><p>I purchased this movie yesterday and couldn't be happier that I have it in my DVD collection.  I was worried because I didn't think Orlando Bloom could carry the movie, but he did a fantastic job.  I couldn't get past picturing him as the elf in Lord of the Rings, but now I see him with new respect for his talent.  The music, the directing, the acting...all top notch.  A great film for lovers of history.  You won't be disappointed if you give it a try.  You will be left craving more information on the subject.  I intend on getting some books on the crusades because of this movie, as my collection of history books is lacking in that area.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Accurate Enough for Me!"></head><body><p>Why should Mel Gibson be villified if his &quot;Patriot&quot; is not 100% historically accurate? This is a MOVIE, for Heaven's Sake, not a Ken Burns PBS documentary. But let's be honest about it: there never has been a war that didn't feature undue cruelty, barbarism, malice, murder and mayhem. If these events depicted didn't happen EXACTLY and ENTIRELY to one group of people, you can be pretty sure that portions of them happened to others.<p>This was actually the first Mel Gibson movie I've ever seen, and I'm glad I caught him finally!</p></body></html>

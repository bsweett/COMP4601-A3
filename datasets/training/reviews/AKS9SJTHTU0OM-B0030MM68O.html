<meta name="summary" content="Powerful, beautifully made war movie"></head><body><p>While set in Iraq, this is not a political film, it examines the psychology of men in  danger, and how some<br />men become addicted to it.<br /><br />Mostly critically lionized, but attacked by many, especially soldiers for being inaccurate.<br /><br />I didn't take the film that literally, or think of it as documentary realism, but more a stylized almost poetic<br />look at the insanity of wars and what can happen to those caught up in them, much like `Full Metal Jacket'.<br />This felt real on a meta level, not a literal one.<br /><br />There were a few logic lapses that bugged me, and the impact emotionally is (by choice I felt) muted.  It's<br />more a disturbing picture than a moving one.<br /><br />But it made me think and made my heart race, and images and moments have stayed with me for a long time</p></body></html>

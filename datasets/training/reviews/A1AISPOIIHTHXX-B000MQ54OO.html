<meta name="summary" content="I wish I hadn't used my bipolar joke already"></head><body><p>Awhile ago, I watched the Polar Express, the all-CG Christmas film by Robert Zemeckis of Back to the Future and Forrest Gump fame. It was a stunning film to look at (except those doll eyes) but the story basically trodded along and I called the film "bi-polar" since it did as much things wrong as it did right. Happy Feet is the exact same way. The animation is consistently stunning but then it's got other elements that prevents it from being a good animation film. It has its fans but some people, like me, won't know what they just saw.<br /><br />In the land of Antarctica, penguins find their mates through "heartsongs" where penguins sing and should someone connect with it, then they become mates. Due to an accident, young Mumble can't sing to save his life but he can tap dance like no one's business. But in penguin land, tap dancing is just not cool and he desperatedly tries to win the affections of penguin Gloria while also solving the problem of the shortage of fish with the help of a young spanish-accented posse.<br /><br />How to describe Happy Feet...it's hard. For one third, it's basically Moulin Rouge! with penguins. It's unbelievably strange to hear penguins sing "Somebody to Love" by Queen but like in Moulin Rouge!, it at least fit the tone and feel. Then it becomes essentially like Dreamworks' films with a bunch of pop-culture references and lowbrow humor, courtesy of Robin Williams heading the spanish posse. Then we get an environmental message and the weirdest last act I've ever seen in an animated movie. How this won over Cars and Monster House is completely beyond me. Cars is considered Pixar's weakest output while Monster House was a bit more intense for the younger viewers so Happy Feet probably got a default win.<br /><br />However, I can't fault the film on the animation. In the special features of Finding Nemo, they asked the animators to get realistic with the water to the point where it looked indisguishable from reality so they had to dial it back and made it more animation friendly. Happy Feet though didn't listen and some shots, such as vista scenes and landscapes look straight out of documentaries; they're just that sharp. Then we have the oh-so-adorable penguin babies and a couple great action scenes with the highlight being Mumble outrunning a sea lion. And I don't want to spoil one other use of filmmaking they used at the end but it's definately a "what the?" moment.<br /><br />Some people are developing a DVD sixth sense: anticipating a double-dip. The extras here are unbelievably light to the point where you just know looking at the back that there's a future 2-disc on its way. Of course the kiddies won't mind but for others who like to get some insight into the film, this is quite disappointing; especially when it's been over a month since the film won the Oscar.<br /><br />The film's got stellar animation but a very schizophrenic story and there's a couple of moments that made me laugh unintentionally (basically the last 10-15 minutes or so) so kids will probably like it while others feel disappointed. That's where I am.</p></body></html>

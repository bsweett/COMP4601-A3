<meta name="summary" content="5 STAR ANGELINA!!! DISSAPOINTING MOVIE!!!"></head><body><p>Angelina Jolie excels as Lady Lara Croft, a wealthy English archaeologist, and modern-times female version of Indiana Jones/James Bond in this video game adaptation. Not only does she look fantastic swinging through the air on bungee cords, knocking out menacing villains clad in black but she totally looks and acts the part of the Tomb Raider heroine Lara Croft, like she was born to play this role. She is stunningly attractive and looks every inch the action hero and what's more, her English accent is absolutely spot on. However, despite her valiant efforts this really is a soul-less film served up by Director Simon West (Con Air) that fails to live up to the excitement of the video games. The action scenes are merely a collection of set-pieces (often borrowed from other movies) that somehow fail to thrill and the plot (what plot?) is about as uninspiring as they come. <p>So what is the "plot"? Tragically, Lara's father, played by real-life dad Jon Voight, died when she was eight, leaving her to a lonely life of raiding tombs... As fate would have it, Lara becomes embroiled in a plot to recover the pieces of an ancient artefact (a small pyramid) that was split into pieces to protect mankind and hidden in unspecified tombs around the world, guarded by elaborate defences. When re-assembled the possessor of the pyramid can control time and space when the planets become aligned and so it is left to Lara to race against time to stop the bad guys and save the planet. <p>There is little or no character development in this movie. None of the main or supporting characters, apart from Lara Croft, are given any depth or explanation for their actions or motivation. Lara, we discover, still mourns the death of her father (Jon Voight, hamming it up with a truly awful accent) but even this sub-plot is pretty pointless. Meanwhile her fellow tomb raiders (Iain Glen plays a particularly loathsome villain) betray each other for no reason other than to serve the plot, and when ultimately Lara risks everything to save her former love (Daniel Craig) it's a bit hard to swallow, particularly when for the previous eighty minutes their has been no evidence of any previous affection or chemistry between the two of them and he spends most of the entire film being villainous with no apparent redeeming qualities. <p>Ultimately the movie has its moments but it's a bit of a mess. No story, a poor script, no character development and lacklustre direction. It has no soul or integrity and insults it's audience's intelligence by assuming that all we want to see is a beautiful big-breasted woman shooting up bad guys in a series of action set-pieces in exotic locations, without any plot or cohesion to hold the movie together. Angelina Jolie certainly can't be blamed for this movie's failure. She excels as the confident and sexy tomb raider and makes a very believable action hero. I just hope that they make a sequel, a much better sequel, with a story, direction and plot to do Angelina Jolie, the character and the games justice.<br /><br />5 STARS FOR ANGELINA, 4 stars for the DVD extras but only 2 stars for the movie!</p></body></html>

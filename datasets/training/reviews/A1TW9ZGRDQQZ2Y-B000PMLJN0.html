<meta name="summary" content="A Decent Ghost Story"></head><body><p>If your expecting another SAW type film that these guys have made in the past, you will be bored to tears. It is fairly slow moving and very little gore. The visuals are nice, but the acting is decent at best. I actually think the twist ending made Dead Silence a better film, even though it wasn't that mind blowing. If I could go back in time I would wait for this one to come out on DVD.<br /><br />2 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></body></html>

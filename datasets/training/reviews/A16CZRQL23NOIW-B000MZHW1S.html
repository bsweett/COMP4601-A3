And the smart script involves the lives of four people, united randomly; a mercenary, an inquisitive journalist, a native and finally the big boss who is beyond stage in this dark affair , best known as conflictive diamonds.<br /><br />There's a lot of action, but also many moments to make us to reflect around this theme.<br /><br />Towering acting of all the cast and fluid direction of this talented director.</p></body></html>

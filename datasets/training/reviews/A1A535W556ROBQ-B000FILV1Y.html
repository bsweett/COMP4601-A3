Hard to imagine anyone wanting to "collect" this title, which I guess is why it sells for 6 bucks and some change.  I see it is $0.01 used.  McConaughey and Jessica Parker essentially spend 90+ minutes primping in front of the camera, with whatever humor provided by Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw as Tripp's parents.  The idea of a 35-year-old live-in son is plausible enough, but the easy going life he leads as he tootles around in his vintage Porsche 911 is the kind of nonsense one comes to expect in such romantic romps.  The only saving grace of this film is Zooey Deschanel, as Parker's oddball roommate.</p></body></html>

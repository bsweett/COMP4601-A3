Transporter director Louis Leterrier turns up the action, while maintaining a light touch without compromising the drama. But, like Iron Man released earlier that summer, it's utterly brainless entertainment with no lasting merit whatsoever.<br /><br />Bruce Banner (now more appropriately played by Edward Norton instead of Eric Banana) is living in South America, away from the authorities who want to turn his curse into a weapon. Over-confident Army soldier Emil Blonsky (a very small, old, and un-threatening Tim Roth) wants a shot at capturing the Hulk, but gets smashed in the process. He is quickly repaired with a magic potion and turns into The Abomination, a creature even more fake than the big, green CGI guy.<br /><br />Like other comic-book movies that preceded it, the ending is nothing but two CGI effects thumping each other until one of them doesn't get back up, while the surrounding environment is destroyed for our 'enjoyment'. I am honestly sick to death of this. The Punisher, with Thomas Jane, kept it real and gritty and it flopped. But CGI trash like Spider-Man, Iron Man, Hulk and Fantastic Four make hundreds of millions. It doesn't make sense to me.<br /><br />Personally, I feel that comic-books are more suited to TV where the characters and plots can be developed over long periods of time instead of rushing through everything with generic, tired motivations in 110 minutes. While this movie is not bad, even the 1978 TV show was better. It sets up a lot for the long-in-development Avengers movie, which is so low on my priorities list it's completely subterranean, including the creation of 'The Leader'. But I doubt we will ever see the character in any sequel, mid-quel, prequel, or spin-off. There's just too much material, and not enough time to fully explore everything.<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk is an inoffensive time-waster. Don't go out of your way for it.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks good in 2.35:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound and a fair amount of extras.</p></body></html>

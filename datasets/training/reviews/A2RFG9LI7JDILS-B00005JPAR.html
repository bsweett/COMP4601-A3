Not quite as perfect as we would have liked it to be - the movie takes a rather direct look into the mouth of death - and our obsession with forstalling the inevitable.. it also seems to be a spiritual quest of sorts.. It seems that there is a sort of transcendence in the end which was really the only way to pull the story together in a way that would be pleasing.. I have to say i enjoyed the movie despite of its shortcomings.. Most of all i admire it for its uniqueness..</p></body></html>

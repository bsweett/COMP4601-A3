<meta name="summary" content="Let's just forget this one and get back to the "real" Man of Steel"></head><body><p>Even though the story isn't horrible and Brandon Routh's Chrisopher Reeve impersonation isn't too far off the mark, I found this movie too weak to be part of the permanent Superman Genre.  You know, the way the Peter Sellers "Casino Royale" isn't really a Bond Film.  Of course, I didn't like Superman III with Reeve and never bothered to see Superman IV.<br /><br />What is good about the film?  Well, it has the comic book silliness.  You know, the space shuttle launching from the back of a 747 because it would get more of a boost from them than two solid rocket boosters, and the familiar engines of the shuttle fire powerfully without any observable place for the fuel.  Almost every scene is full of the same kind of nonsense, but it is this daffy disregard for reality is part and parcel of comic books.  I also liked the fact that Superman more or less levitates in this film rather than "flying" like a jet.  Since he has no "thrusters", levitating makes more sense.<br /><br />I hated what they did to his outfit.  The cape and boots are too dark and the "S" signature on his chest is too small and too high.  However, since they were turning the "Man of Steel" into some kind of metrosexual, using the "S" as a bodice rather than a shield or breastplate might make some sort of perverse sense.<br /><br />And the inversion of sexual mores is complete in this film with Lois Lane becoming a single mom, the details of which you will have to learn for yourself by seeing the film.  However, if such a plot point had been used in the original superman, well, one would not have required super hearing to notice the instantaneous outcry from the public.<br /><br />My advice is to treat this film the way the middle "Highlander" films were treated when they decided to get back to the original.  Just ignore it and pretend it never happened and get back to the "real" Superman in the next film.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey played Lex Luthor pretty straight, as a sort of emotionally void killer.  He is smart and an egomaniac, but doesn't have the inner humor of the Gene Hackman Luthor and Spacey never plays for laughs.  I actually liked his performance.</p></body></html>

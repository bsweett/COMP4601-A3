<meta name="summary" content="The Horror!  The Horror! (flashbacks to catholic gradeschool, that is)"></head><body><p>So for anyone who had that special of an experience in catholic gradeschool that they now consider themselves anything but catholic, watch this movie prepared.  The nuns are square on - cold, heartless and terrifying (save for one good hearted one).  Ah, but without continuing this personal expose, this was a great film about some of the worst tendencies of human nature - gossip.  And the priest delivers a fantastic sermon on gossip with a great allegory.  My wife and I actually discussed this one for several days debating on whether he did it nor not.  That's the mark of a good story for me - giving you something to debate.  As much as I dislike Hoffman, he was great and played the role perfectly.  And Meryl Streep is, as always, fantastic, but with an accent that wavers a little in its believability.</p></body></html>

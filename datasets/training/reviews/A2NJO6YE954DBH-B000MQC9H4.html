<meta name="summary" content="Forget about Diaz, Law and Black because "The Holiday" comes down to Winslet and Wallach"></head><body><p>Three things I think after having watched, "The Holiday."  The first is that Eli Wallach stole this romantic comedy.  He plays Arthur Abbott, who in his younger days was an Oscar winning screenwriter and who is now a neighbor of Iris (Kate Winslet) now that the young English woman is living in the Hollywood mansion of Amanda (Cameron Diaz), who is now living in the little English cottage of Iris in Surrey.  The two women have swapped homes this particular Christmas because Iris has discovered her ex-boyfriend is getting married and Amanda just needs to get away from her job making movie trailers.  Since it is a romantic comedy both of the women meet men, with Amanda running into Iris' brother Graham (Jude Law), and Iris meeting Miles (Jack Black), a composer.  The problem is that the most interesting and endearing relationship in the film is between Iris and Arthur.  Jack Black is trying to play things straight here, something he had proven he can do already in "Shallow Hall" (when he discovers why Cadence is in the hospital), but he is totally wasted in this movie, even if Wallach is not stealing every scene he is in without breaking a sweat.<br /><br />The second thing I am thinking is that there is a reason why Kate Winslet is the youngest actress to have earned five Oscar nominations for her work.  I am not saying that this performance is worth of a nomination, but every time we had a scene of Cameron Diaz working so hard to act it was refreshing to get back to Winslet showing how it should be done.  Again, the sparks between her and Wallach are the highpoint of this film.  The third thing on my list is that they did not take advantage of the running gag of Amanda picturing a trailer of her sad and pathetic love life in her own mind.  Actually, all we usually get to hear is the familiar voice of Hal Douglas narrating the trailer, but I think there was a whole lot more mileage to get out of the idea (e.g., showing the same scenes but giving them totally different spins by changing the music and the voiceovers).<br /><br />Finally, and most importantly in terms of my ultimate evaluation of this film, I think that this film lacks a key requirement of most romances, which is the grand gesture.  Actually, it needs two grand gestures given that there are two romances trying to flower here.  Now the label of grand gesture is somewhat hyperbolic, because sometimes the boy can get the girl at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800141741">"hello"</a> or not <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXCI">say anything</a> and just stand with a boom box playing the right song.  But I think there should be something both unique and significant that somebody does to get the person they love.  Think of your favorite romantic comedies and I bet you can think of the grand gesture, the pivotal romantic moment, in each.  In "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMFQ">Love Actually</a>" there are at least three of them, and what passes for one in "The Holiday" has to do with (surprise, surprise) Iris and Arthur.  Watching this film was enjoyable enough, but they basically fast forward to the requisite happy ending without making these characters even try to earn our tears and I am rounding up on this only because of the scenes between Wallach and Winslet.</p></body></html>

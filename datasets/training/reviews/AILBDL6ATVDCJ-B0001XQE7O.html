<meta name="summary" content="Just Not That Good."></head><body><p>This movie could have been as good as Forrest Gump, but it lacked a great screenplay.  There are some great moments, but those moments don't come around often enough.  The movie seems to drag quite a bit.  Ewan McGregor stars as the young Albert Finney, and he would have been great had the script not led him astray.  <p>This movie had a LOT of potential, and I think that is why I was so disappointed.<p>Tim Burton fans might still like it because of the quirkiness of the storyline and filming, but I'm not a superfan of Burton.<p>Save your cash, rent it, don't buy it.<p>See ya next review.<br />www.therunningirl.com</p></body></html>

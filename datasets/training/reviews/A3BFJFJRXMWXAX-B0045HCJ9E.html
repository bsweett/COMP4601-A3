This movie is as great as it ever was, but the DVD treatment here is pretty bad. The picture and sound elements need some major help. The extras are nice, but you are paying for the FILM after all aren't you!? So move right along and keep your eyes open for a Criterion Collection edition. This film deserves MUCH, MUCH more.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="still packs a punch so many (SW-filled) years later"></head><body><p>Huge alien ships descend on Earth, wiping out whole cities with their death-rays while themselves remaining safe behind their impenetrable energy screens. Those left by the death-rays are annihilated by swarms of enemy fighters that fly in huge, insect-like clouds (and are similarly shielded). Not even nukes can stop these guys. But one man has the brainstorm that may save the world.<br /><br />It's easy to say that this was THE popcorn flick to catch in 1996, but nearly 10 years later, it's easy to step back and see what else went right besides millions in CGI.  ID4 combined the right mix of FX, can-do ingenuity and patriotism missing from follow-ups like "Godzilla".  Bill Pullman plays the President, an ex-fighter jock who starts off telling his aides that "we have no cause to fear" until the alien baddies demolish the White House in the now classic money-shot. Jeff Golblume plays one of his stock characters - the brilliant-but-awkward type who despite his lowly tech job working for a cable TV service run by Harvey Fierstein, comes up with the idea that may defeat the aliens. Will Smith is the Marine who flies his F-18 like something out of Star Wars, and comes up with some of the flick's best lines and most of its sheer gusto.<br /><br />As a blockbuster, this flick grossed cash while naturally inflaming critics. In some ways, this alien-invasion epic deserves both the praise and criticism, though for reasons different than fans and panners would suggest. The special effects sometimes show their limits (especially at the end when the alien ships fly across the screen like mosquitoes, as opposed to those in "Star Wars" which alternate between being a dot in a huge on a frame of film in a complex background to filling the screen), and much of the visual impact is lost unless you've got the wide-screen version. The dialog won't win anybody any Oscars (the best lines sound conspicuously ad-libbed; the rest sounds no better than "you're father was a hero, you should be proud of him"), and some promising characters and ideas just get tossed out completely (especially those dealing with "Area-51" and the chief geeky scientist played by Trek alum Brent Spiner) before the script has any fun with them.<br /><br />WHY THIS MOVIE ROCKS (ANYWAY): The flick's imperfect FX are still spectacular and remain so nearly a (Star Wars-filled) decade later. Clearly the design team was inspired by SW, but had more than a creative nod than the hordes responsible for perpetrating the past 2 decades worth of SW rip-offs on us ("StarCrash" or "Message From Space" come to mind). Some of the characters rise above the sort of shallow cardboard you'd expect, or otherwise allow remnants of previous roles they've played to give more charm to their roles here (like Robert Loggia as a general, or Harry Connick Jr. in an inspired bit of miscasting as Will Smith's wing man). But above all, ID4 excels because its makers took an idea that was never really original but also took the bold step of handling it all - militant, locust like aliens, epic-scale dogfights, huge motherships, impenetrable force-fields - as if it had never been done before, and giving the whole premise an unmatched sense of depth.</p></body></html>

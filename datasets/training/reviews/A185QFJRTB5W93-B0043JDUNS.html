<meta name="summary" content="A Worthy Part 2"></head><body><p>This film was a true worthy follow-up to one of the best superhero films of all time. Inspired by the storyline from the late 80s 'Armor Wars' arc, Iron Man 2 has our hero fighting against his invention being weaponized while at the same time fighting those who are stealing his tech. There is no one who can pull off Tony Stark like Robert Downey Jr. His portrayal is worth watching even if he never dons the suit. This is good, because Iron Man gets very little screen time against his alter ego in this installment. A perfect precusor to Avengers and Thor, with a slight nod to Captain America. You cannot go wrong here!</p></body></html>

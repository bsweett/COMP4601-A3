<meta name="summary" content="My favorite musical of all time!"></head><body><p>The breathtaking Alps, lakes and grassy slopes welcome you into the charming land of Austria. The wide open spaces give an instant sense of freedom. The scenes are set in Salzburg, Austria in the 30's.  Suddenly you will see a grassy slope and Maria (Julie Andrews) bursts onto the screen with her childlike joy and sweet innocent nature. Her soul lives to be free, her arms stretch out (as in the cover picture) as she swirls around singing as only a person who is a child at heart can. Suddenly she realizes she has wandered far, far away from the Abbey.  The nun's know Maria all too well and start a discussion about why they love her so much. "She's always late for everything except for every meal."  Maria seems to be fighting her innermost desire to be free and it is very apparent she is not well suited for the calling. Her Mother Superior sets her free to follow her heart by helping her to see the need to accept a position of Governess to "seven" children.<br /><br />"You have to live the life you were born to live." --Mother Superior<br /><br />Soon the children have learned to sing, frolic with life and completely exasperate their father who discourages any sign of fun. Once he leaves for a visit in Vienna, the children get to go on picnics, bike rides, train rides and other fun adventures. Laughter is in every scene and singing is the focus.<br /><br />When their father, Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), a lonely widower tries to introduce a haughty Baroness to them, they are not at all impressed. So the stage is set for humor, love, happiness, sadness, fear, jealousy, deceit, romance and adventure. The chemistry between Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer reaches its height in a beautiful Austrian folk dance. The tension mounts and the Baroness appears.  She has truly evil intentions for Maria and the children, who she would just as well send off to boarding school.<br /><br />In the first half of the movie, life is pleasant and follows an upbeat theme. In the second half, you will have trouble not crying all the way to the end. Happiness can sometimes make you cry as well. You can literally feel the invincible human spirit rising in you as you celebrate the family's daring flight from Nazi rule. Only a true story could be this inspirational. I truly cannot watch this movie without wanting to sing along with at least half the songs. Julie Andrews voice is magical. If you appreciate impeccable acting, breathtaking scenery, and a feeling of true romance....call me sentimental, but you will love this movie. The only thing which saddens me is that some people are truly too jaded to appreciate the beauty in this movie. I guess I still have the child in me that wants to believe in a fairy tale, yet this was based on a true story, and perhaps real life is the best story of all.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review</p></body></html>

While it's not quite as bad as its detractors claim, it suffers from a terrible screenplay by John Logan that never manages to integrate characterization into the action, leaving most of it to be found in the DVD's deleted scenes bin, while slogging through an incredibly undernourished but tediously dragged out and dull story that has one good but barely utilized idea in having as its villain a younger clone of the Enterprise's captain. How did they manage it? They must have got a hair off the bald captain's comb is the main theory offered (this may be a joke, but judging from how crude the comedy is elsewhere that's doubtful). Why did they do it? Part of an elaborate conspiracy they, er, gave up on years ago. But he's got a plan to make the Romulan Empire great again, of course. Probably. Quite what his nefarious plot to destroy the Federation is is never really explained so there's not much in the way of threat - especially since the villain only has one spaceship and quickly loses his allies because he keeps wasting time playing mind games or committing the odd psychic rape rather than getting down to delivering the conquest and pillage he promised. Oh, and he needs Captain Picard's DNA to stop himself prematurely self-destructing. Only, on second thoughts, he decides not to bother and to do something else instead. Quite what isn't exactly clear, but it involves filling much of the last third of the movie with a desperately unexciting space battle against a dull green background before yet another of the regular TV cast makes the ultimate sacrifice. Unfortunately this time round there is absolutely no reason for him to do so, and this being Star Trek where no popular character is allowed to stay dead (it even took two death scenes to kill off Captain Kirk in Generations) the ending is yet another copout. Koboyashi Maru indeed...<br /><br />A clumsy and half-hearted rehash of The Wrath of Khan and The Undiscovered Country, this voyage is clearly one for the money, with the regulars topping up their pension funds big time and the guest stars getting screwed. Even Ron Perlman makes no impression whatsoever in what looks like a cheap Halloween Skeletor mask (easily the worst makeup job in Star Trek history, and that includes the green chick and the plastic lizard guy in the 60s TV show). Still, you can have a few cheap laughs at the expense of the distinctly unthreatening Tom Hardy and the gleeful sadism of casting someone who can't pronounce his `r's as a Reman who has usurped control of the Romulan Empire, leading to lines like "Womulans feel thweatened by Wemen upstawts" or "We will no longer bow befawr anyone as slaves. Not the Womulans and not your mighty Fedewation. We are a wace bwed for waw... and conqwest" - at times it's like listening to Biggus Dickus addressing the crowd in Monty Python's Life of Brian. The usually reliable Stuart Baird, wearing his directing hat, can do nothing to liven things up, and even the great Jerry Goldsmith's score is distinctly professional but workmanlike. Incredibly dull stuff.<br /><br />The extras package on the 2-disc set at least is impressive, carrying over all the extras from the one-disc release and adding to them comprehensively with additional added scenes and more featurettes than you could possibly want - even the Easter egg featurettes are a decent length for once. If only they graced a better film...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a mixed bag, but a fairly enjoyable thriller"></head><body><p>By about a half hour into "Secret Window," I had pretty much figured out what was really happening and where the story was heading.  That's not usually a good sign when it comes to films of this type, but "Secret Window" still manages to be a fairly efficient psycho/stalker thriller, even with its painfully obvious triple-somersault-with-a-double-back-flip ending.<br /><br />Based on a Stephen King work, the film stars Johnny Depp as a writer named Morton Rainey, a character we may assume is not too far removed in some ways from the author himself.  One day, Rainey is approached by a mysterious stranger from Mississippi (John Turturro) who accuses the writer of having plagiarized one of his stories (published by Rainey under the title "Secret Window").  Despite Rainey's protests of innocence in the matter, the man, who calls himself "Shooter," starts making life miserable for the young author, who is already struggling with a messy divorce from the wife (Maria Bello) he caught cheating on him in a nearby motel.<br /><br />Thrillers like "Secret Window" always seem to be caught between a rock and a hard place when it comes to working out their storylines.  Modern audiences have developed such an insatiable appetite for ever more elaborate plot twists and surprise turnabout endings that the writers of these films end up having to compromise narrative plausibility to satisfy the demand.  As a result, like most thrillers these days, "Secret Window" starts off well then goes steadily downhill, as the plot elements begin to spin more and more out of control and credibility flies out the window.<br /><br />For a good part of the time, "Secret Window" is fun to watch, as Depp tries to figure out what it is that this enigmatic stranger really wants.  Although the red herrings are not always totally effective, they do occasionally divert us off the tried-and-true path along which the story is traveling.  The film is at its best when dealing with the tensions between Rainey, his wife, Amy, and her current lover, Ted, played by Timothy Bottoms.  The actors bring a human dimension to what is, after all, a pretty soulless exercise in audience manipulation.  Turturro has a fun time hamming it up with his cornpone Southern accent, although he still manages to come across as a threatening and menacing figure from time to time.<br /><br />There's a small window hidden behind a piece of furniture that may or may not hold the key to everything, but it is so confusingly handled in the screenplay that the audience is left scratching its head trying to figure out what it all means. Indeed, that is the biggest shortcoming of the movie's final act; besides being silly, implausible and way over-the-top, it doesn't make the connections it needs to in order for us to understand what's really going on.  It's all a game of a thriller, but a game that fails to lay down the rules in a fair enough way so that we in the audience can play along as well.  As a result, we feel very much cheated and had by the time the closing credits come crawling by.  So, if you go into "Secret Window" with your eyes open and your credibility meter shut off, you may wind up enjoying the film.</p></body></html>

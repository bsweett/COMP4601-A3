<meta name="summary" content=""I don't eat children either." - "Alice""></head><body><p>Natalie Portman hasn't had an appropriate leading man since Jean Reno in The Professional.  This movie made me especially miss their pairing.  She seems too much for the people in this film, beyond their capacity to comprehend.  I think everyone is lying in this movie and no, Alice does not love Crocodile.  She just doesn't look like she belongs with any of these people and London looks empty and uncomfortable.  The best thing about this movie is the line that she delivers early in the movie that she doesn't "eat children either." and the second best thing about this movie is the sofas.</p></body></html>

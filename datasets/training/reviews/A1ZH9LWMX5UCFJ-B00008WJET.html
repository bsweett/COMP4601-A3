The girls are a great team with their different personalities and expertises. The special effects are awesome (especially the alley fight scene) and the bonus features were cool to show the effects broke down. The plot kept me interested and didn't drag out and become ridiculous like some tend to do. The cast was great, the girls and Bill Murray especially. I could watch it again and again!</p></body></html>

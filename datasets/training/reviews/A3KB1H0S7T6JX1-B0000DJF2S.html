<meta name="summary" content="A movie worth watching!"></head><body><p>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen brings to the screen the story of an unlikely group of people that have banded together in order to put an end to a criminal mind's schemes bent on plunging the world in total war so that he may profit from increased arms sales.<br />The year is 1899 and the British government has called upon hunter Allan Quatermain to join a band of 19th century superheroes in preventing the Fantom from destroying the world.  The Fantom, however, begs to differ...<br />There are hints of James Bond, Dracula, Van Helsing, and Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde among others so the movie falls into the action/adventure/horror type of category.<br />Sean Connery and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills.<br />The setting, the plot, the special effects (!), the music, and the costumes are all good.<br />The only major setback was in relation to Tom Sawyer (?), who seemed totally out of place among the rest, and who probably was incorporated for the sake of including an American hero.<br />In short, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection.<br />BRING ON THE SEQUEL!</p></body></html>

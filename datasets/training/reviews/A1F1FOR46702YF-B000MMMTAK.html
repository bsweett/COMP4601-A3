<meta name="summary" content="Coming to America"></head><body><p>Comedian Sacha Baron Cohen (Da Ali G Show & Talladega Nights) takes a cross-country road-trip through the United States in the breakthrough comedy "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan". Popular TV journalist Borat Sagdiyev (Cohen) travels from his simple home in Kazakhstan to the United States to record a documentary about American customs to bring back to his beloved home. With his able producer Azamat Bagatov, Borat interacts with Americans and heads to California to seduce "Baywatch" star Pamela Anderson. "Borat" is an outrageously humorous mockumentary that showcases Cohen's fearless comedic talents. Most scenes in the movie are unscripted with real Americans. "Borat" isn't for everyone. Due to its prejudiced remarks, the mockumentary generated much controversy and was banned in several countries. In the United States, "Borat" received strong positive reviews by critics, became a commercial success and received numerous awards.<br /><br />If you enjoyed "Borat" in theaters then pick up your copy of critically acclaimed mockumentary on DVD. The mockumentary is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. Due to the various types of cameras used in the film, the picture quality is somewhat mixed but still pretty sharp. The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound isn't terrific but still clean and well-balanced. The DVD contains 8 deleted scenes that were cut from the film, and a 17-minute collection of footage made to promote the film. Overall, "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan" earns a "B".</p></body></html>

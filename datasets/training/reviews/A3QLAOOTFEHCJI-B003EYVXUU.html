<meta name="summary" content="A perfect remake of a very good vampire thriller"></head><body><p>This is one of those rare Hollywood remakes of a good Euro film - in this case the Swedish "Let the Right One In" - that is actually better than the original.  While I liked the original 2008 film, I thought it left too many questions unanswered which drew away attention from the main story.  This includes the controversial vampire he-or-she question.  More on that later.  This film which was brilliantly directed and written by "Cloverfield's" Matt Reeves, smartly avoids the question for the most part.<br /><br />The best thing about this sweet, tender, violent, bloody movie is the 2 young leads.  Both should go far and I expect Chloe Moretz will break a few hearts along the way.  The film does closely follow the predecessor and even repeats some dialog word for word.  Transplanted to remote Los Alamos, New Mexico, the film works on every level.  At times you forget you are watching a "vampire movie", but instead watching a budding young love relationship.  Don't get too comfortable however, there's enough blood to go around.<br /><br />Finally, this question from the original movie of whether Abby (this movie) ne Eli (Swedish) is a boy or girl.  This film wisely removes the question.  The original leaves it open for discussion.  My research comes up with numerous theories, none of which made much sense to me.  Since this is an adaptation from a book, I checked it out.  In the book, the author says Eli is an androgynous boy from centuries ago castrated by a sadistic vampire nobleman.  Yeah, that won't work for us Americanos.<br /><br />This Blu ray transfer is flawless with beautiful dark night scenes and clear view of blood splatterings.  The Dolby True HD 5.1 surround is perfect.</p></body></html>

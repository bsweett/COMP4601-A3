<meta name="summary" content="NO CHEAP THRILLS. A SMART MOVIE"></head><body><p>I had a lot of prejudice against this movie. I thought: well, a new horror (must be like all recent stupid horrors) starring Kate Hudson(?!)... When I started watching I was like "C'mon, show me something I haven't seen yet". I was absolutely sure that everything in the film would be secondary, that all the thrills presented there I'd be able to tell right from the very begining. Haunted house? Oh, please... "Boogeyman", "The Grudge"... We've seen it all. The door in the attic clatters itself? Well, it must be some animal jumping at you along with a pinnacle of an uneasy musical theme... So that was my attitude when I started watching. Actually I didn't even want to rent it, but finally persuaded myself since I'm interested in the genre.<br /><br />And I was happy to see the film ended up being totally different from what I expected to see. Kate Hudson (who was always OK for flicks like "200 cigarettes", as I thought, but nothing more) was utterly believable here, I have to say I really liked her. John Hurt was brilliant in his silent role (he sure can give you creeps with just one glance of his). New Orleans atmosphere and nature played a big part in "The Skeleton Key", all the swamps, those trees... Well, you get my point. And finally the story line appeared to be not recycled at all, it was rather fresh and intriguing. Although the film is not that terrifying and disturbing it manages to surprise you. And while I was thinking the pay-off was pretty predictable (I was partly right, but it doesn't diminish the story though), the finale still surprised me. It didn't only ruin the movie as it often happens, it actually boosted its value. I didn't see it coming, I was surprised and finally had a feeling those were hour and a half spent not in vain. If you're a horror fan you'll be pleased to see "The Skeleton Key" while not thinking about it as of a masterpiece. And if you are not you'll still like it, for it is not stupid, it has sense and it's not that scary you won't be able to sleep afterwards. Nice film.</p></body></html>

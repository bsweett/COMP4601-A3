<meta name="summary" content="Some Blu specs on a popular thriller"></head><body><p>Am not a fan of the film's ending, which overall leaves a bad remembrance of what could have been, but the Blu has a nice offering.<br /><br />The picture and sound are outstanding, with plenty of references for both, even including that muddled ending and the fireball effects. The supplements help answer a few questions and include:<br /><br />* A six-minute interview session of some legal "experts" about the law issues seen in the film.<br />* Behind the scenes in black and white, 15 minutes. Interviews/set footage in black and white while the film clips shown are in color. Not quite sure what the contrast reasoning was, but the director kept saying how he wanted this film to be different than the other movies that might be categorized as similar.<br />* VFX snippets, 5 of them at 6:30 minutes. Was disappointed in some of the effects shots they thought were "great" (snow on a sunny clear day - and viewers are supposed to miss that?)...but at least they covered what the original ending was going to be - much better than what was installed.<br />* Disc 2 - Director's Cut - much better version of the film. 10 minutes longer and had a variety of additions, including:<br />++ Longer version of the first meeting with Butler's character regarding the plea (you only see the paper under Foxx's phone in theatrical).<br />++ Joke by defense attorney in court - shows why everyone was looking at him funny in the theatrical.<br />++ Nice vulgarity by the female prosecutor in the execution chamber scene.<br />++ Torture scene much longer.<br />++ More footage of the torture chamber when found by the police.<br />++ Footage of Colm Meaney wanting to head shot Butler in the prison yard gate sequence.<br />++ A bunch of dialogue bits and longer takes - added more edge to the film and gave it a much better R version than shown.<br /><br />Two versions of the same film on two different BDs, almost makes it to where you want to get rid of the disc you will never watch depending on your likes/dislikes. Apparently you cannot get this version on DVD, so between the amount of upset feelers out there over that and the atrocious ending, I can't see giving this higher than a 4-star.</p></body></html>

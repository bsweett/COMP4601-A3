<meta name="summary" content="Were you a teenage geek?"></head><body><p>Did you wear braces, and called metalmouth by all kinds of idiots? Did you take horrible school photos? Did you have to stuff your bra? Did you have a ruffled skirt, and wore massive scrunchies in your hair? Did you want to be in with the popular crowd, but knew you couldn't stand a chance? Did you have a best male friend, who secretly fancied you?<br /><br /> OK, I didn't have the latter, but the rest was/is me! That's one of the reasons this film struck a chord with me. I was the young Jenna in this movie. But I'm 10 years off 30, and have no plans of getting there anytime soon!<br /><br /> Jennifer Garner in the movie is wonderfully dorky, awkward, but so great! She plays the part brilliantly, and still manages the guy - despite managing to chat up a thirteen year old halfway through.<br /><br /> There are a few minor problems with this otherwise great movie. Jenna is 30 in 2004 - so when she was 13 would have been 1988? Yet the most popular tracks for the movie (Pat Benatar's &quot;Love is a Battlefield&quot; and Michael Jackson's &quot;Thriller&quot;) are both from 1983, five years before. Someone didn't do the research on popular music from 1988. The tracks they could have had in the movie could have been George Michael's &quot;Faith&quot;, Tracey Chapman's &quot;Fast Car&quot;, INXs' &quot;New Sensation&quot; and heaven forbid we remind everyone who grew up in the 80s, Debbie Gibson.<br /><br /> The scene where they all dance to &quot;Thriller&quot; looks a bit awkward at times (Jennifer Garner's smile sometimes seems rather fake, as it doesn't reach her eyes) but was pure class - even though NO ONE would dare admit to knowing the moves. (I don't even remember the song)<br /><br /> Mark Ruffalo was fantastic as the best male friend that had such an obvious crush on Jenna, but she was too blind to see it. And instead fancies the most popular guy in school (isn't that how it always works?) who later turns out to be a fat, balding, taxi driver.<br /><br /> The movie has a very sad ending (albeit happy), so bring out the tissues! It's a great movie overall, Jennifer Garner is pure genius as the female 'Big', and the overall awkwardness of her is well done. Worthwhile having.</p></body></html>

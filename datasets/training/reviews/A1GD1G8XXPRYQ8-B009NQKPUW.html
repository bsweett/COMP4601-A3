Then, almost at the end I got my desired action. Another disappointment is lack of aliens from other movies. I don't know whether it was good or bad. We saw the new species, but as the prequel to alien I expected to see at least one facehugger. I don't really see much connection between Xenomorphs and those aliens. Then, at the end I wanted to see the scientist travel to another planet. Those who watched the movie, know why she would travel on that planet, but still they could just give another 30 minutes to show exactly what would happen. Ending didn't satisfy me. There will be no second part to the movie, so I felt disappointed. Still, it isn't a waste of time, just a little boring movie. And last but not least, I knew there would a famous actress playing in Prometheus. I expected Angelina Jolie. But Charlize Theron was chosen and she was great! I really thought that this decision would suck. I was wrong. She was by far my favorite actress in the movie. Others played good, but I had no feelings to them.</p></body></html>

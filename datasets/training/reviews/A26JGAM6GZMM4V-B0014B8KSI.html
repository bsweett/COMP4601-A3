My purpose now is to explain why I enjoyed this film so much. There are several reasons. Here are three. First, There is a multi-dimensional texture of ambiguity to the plot development because, until the film's conclusion, there are so many unanswered questions about, for example, relationships between and among the major characters. That is why most of the action occurs at night. Indeed, it can be argued that, as written and then directed by Tony Gilroy, the darker components of human nature (i.e. greed, ambition, mendacity, betrayal) comprise the primary subject of the film. With the obvious exceptions of Michael Clayton (George Clooney) and Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), there is an almost total lack of nobility in the behavior of the main characters.<br /><br />Also, I liked the pace of the plot. Separately and together, both Clayton and Edens seem to be wandering through a minefield. They are desperate to survive what become for Edens, eventually, life-threatening perils and for Clayton, throughout the film, what continue to be serious financial problems. Gilroy does not allow the plot to drag, nor does he rush through the sequence of events. He allows the story (on several separate but connected levels) to unfold over a four-day period.<br /><br />Finally, I greatly admire Clooney's performance as Clayton, a "fixer" for a major law firm who seems unable to fix any of the broken parts in his personal life. He is still recovering emotionally from a failed marriage, has strained relations with his family (especially with two brothers), struggles with mixed results to be a good father to a son he obviously adores, and - meanwhile - is about to lose ownership of a restaurant that was to have enabled him to leave the law firm. Clooney brilliantly captures Clayton's tenderness and desperation as well as his sharply honed problem-solving skills. When we first encounter him, Clayton is what Graham Greene would characterize as a "burnt out case." By the end of the film, he has survived (but barely) and stares blankly at nothing, drifting somewhere between emptiness and despair.<br /><br />Of all the films I have seen during the past year, this one and The Departed are among the few that I continue to think about each day and that I am eager to see again. That may be all that they share in common...but it is sufficient for me.</p></body></html>

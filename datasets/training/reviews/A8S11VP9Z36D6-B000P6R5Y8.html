Unlike the marketing campaign which makes this film look like a Narnia-style movie, this movie is very simple in its storytelling, with a few fantasy elements thrown in. What makes it so refreshing is that children are shown creating their own world of play, without the spoon-fed creativity killing trappings of an ipod or video game. AnnaSophia Robb is amazing; she lights up the screen with her smile and endearing performance. Warning: this movie is a tearjerker, and especially for young children, can be somewhat intense. However, the themes are handled well and if watched with a supervised adult, the discussion that could follow the watching of this film would be enlightening.</p></body></html>

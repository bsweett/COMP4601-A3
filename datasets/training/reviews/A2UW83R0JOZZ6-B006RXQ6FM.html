Winner of four Tony awards including Best Play in 2005, author John Patrick Shanley's superb story is one of the more smooth and succinct Broadway-to-Hollywood transitions to come along in a great while.<br /><br />It is a blustery winter in 1964 at the St. Nicholas Catholic Church.  Sister Aloysius (Streep), the principal of St. Nicholas Catholic primary school, presides over her students with fear and intimidation.  Though stern and seemingly mirthless on the surface, Aloysius is empowered by the grace of God and believes in the saving of her student's minds and souls through discipline and contrition.  Father Flynn (Hoffman), the new parish priest, views things differently, his friendly and newfangled approach bristling the staunchly traditional Sister Aloysius to a curious degree.  She views him from the beginning with a critical gaze, his aim to change things rustling her old feathers considerably, but it isn't until he takes a special interest in Donald Miller (the school's one and only black student) that the seeds of doubt are planted in her mind.  Sister James (Adams), a novice in her profession as well as in the ways of the world, thinks Flynn charming and believes his interest in Donald is with good intention.  But time and experience have Sister Aloysius believing otherwise and she begins digging deeper for the truth, those seeds of doubt now taking root in her heart.  All  the while Flynn rebukes her interrogations but oddly enough does everything except proclaim his innocence.  The peripatetic winds that Sister Aloysius complains of begin to mount in their intensity the further she prods into the situation, and when she and Flynn finally confront one another, a literal and figural storm has brewed, their fury towards one another brilliantly underscored by the blinding flash of lightning and the menacing roll of thunder from the heavens above them.<br /><br />"Doubt", much like its title, creeps into the subconscious, festering, and it is a masterpiece in all its subtleties, particularly its use of visual metaphor.  Whereas other films practically beat you over the head with suspense, "Doubt" whispers it in your ear, its calm, hushed tone provoking a more attentive eye and ear to its proceedings.  With John Patrick Shanley serving as writer and director for the adaptation of his successful stage play, "Doubt" remains nearly 100% intact and fully realized according to Shanley's vision.  Foregoing visual effects and tricky camera angles, the play's impact and presence on a stage comes through on screen, the simplistic beauty of its cinematography and the focus on its small but superior cast making it an exquisite film that centers solely on its deeply dramatic story.<br /><br />Each of the four roles is a labyrinthine ship commanded only by the best captain, and each actor navigates and mans their vessel with power and precision.  It comes as no surprise that all four actors were nominated for Oscars (though none of them won) as well as a nomination for Shanley for his screenplay (which lost out to "Slumdog Millionaire", a HUGE upset in my humble opinion).  Adams nails the wide-eyed innocence of Sister James and offers a quiet intensity while Streep glowers, smirks and steadfastly barrels through as Sister Aloysius.  Hoffman imbues Flynn with an intriguing mixture of mischief and tenderness while at the same time suggesting with a glint of his eye a covertness that Sister Aloysius immediately detects.  Though Davis is only present for two scenes in the film's 104-minute runtime (one in which she doesn't even have any lines), her small role as Mrs. Miller is sublime, made memorable in her capable hands; she even manages to make one forget that a powerhouse like Streep is standing right there with her.<br /><br />This single disc DVD edition comes with some interesting extras, the most intriguing being a featurette entitled "Doubt: From Stage to Screen" in which Shanley shares his own thoughts and feelings about the play, its transition from stage to screen, commentary from its actors and an impromptu interview he conducted with Streep.  Shanley chose to shoot the film in the neighborhood he himself grew up in, centering his outdoor shots on the very intersection where he attended Catholic school in the Bronx.  He also managed to come into contact with Sister Margaret James (the very woman on whom the character Sister James is based) from the school he attended and she served as a technical advisor on the film, helping Streep and Adams with the application of their habits and rosaries.  "The Cast of Doubt" is a casual sit down with the four main actors, "Scoring Doubt" reviews composer Howard Shore's inspiration for the film's music and "The Sisters of Charity" offers an enlightening background on the origin of the Sisters of Charity of New York and the humbling, often thankless work of the nuns.<br /><br />Bottom line: Truly one of the best films of 2008, "Doubt" will leave a lasting impression on viewers who crave a good, absorbing drama that offers them the opportunity to form many different interpretations from its complex story.</p></body></html>

Linda, one day, wakes up and gets the news that Jim is dead. She wakes up the next morning to find him alive.<br />She decides to investigate what is happening, to try and prevent her husband's death.<br /><br />Not exactly fast-paced, and certainly not the greatest thriller/suspense movie, this isn't Bullock's best either! It is however refreshing to see McMahon in a movie rather than his usual Nip/Tuck series. The kids are not well cast - neither of them look like Sandra or Julian.<br /><br />The ending IS a disappointment. Since this is a thriller/suspense, you would think the scriptwriter would have come up with some not-obvious ending. However, he did. So halfway through the movie, what you expect to happen does happen, and that is utterly annoying.<br />And that very last scene? How stupid could that be. Useless. One of the worst useless scenes I've seen - sooo American.<br /><br />Nothing original, or new in this movie.<br /><br />Still entertaining, despite its plot holes. But I wouldn't watch it again.</p></body></html>

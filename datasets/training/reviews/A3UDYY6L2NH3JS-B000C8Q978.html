An old ? bachelor ?, which means (typically American) an unmarried lady's man, is titillated by life : one more girl friend goes away, and a letter arrives from an old anonymous girl-firend announcing the existence and eventually popping up of a 19 year old son of his. He is dumb enough to get on the road to check his old girlfriends to try to find out the one who is playing with his nerves, because the idea of having a son is definitely trying on his nerves. And of course he ends up in a blind alley, or rather a set of five blind alleys all dead. That's Jarmush. These ? bachelors ? of the libertine generation of the 60s, 70s and 80s are just misfits when they reach the ripe age of sixty. They have a luxurious house, they have a good income, but they have nothing affective, nothing sentimental. They are a wasteland left on furrow for fifty years and there is like a crazy dream that maybe they would enjoy a son or a daughter, or whatever that could look stable till the final departure. Jarmush is a sentimental undertaker who buries even the slightest and smallest illusion we may have about a possible redemption in this world. We were abandoned a long time ago by all gods that we imagined existed and we find ourselves, soulless, selfless, godless, and so on, in other words in total ? suffering ? (Dukkha in Buddhist Pali) by lack and want of human sentiments. Jarmusch is the Buddhist of Hollywood.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The New "Golden Avenger" Standard for Superhero Films"></head><body><p>I saw this at a local theater with my co-worker friend on a very rainy day while on a two and a half hour lunch from work (ok, we played hooky).  It was the first show of the first day that this film was released.  I think there were about 30 people in the theater.  I had to wait 2 weeks to let my "giddies" subside enough so that I could write a somewhat coherent review.  I've gotten in the habit of writing in little, categorized chapters.  Here goes;<br /><br />THIS FILM ROCKS!!!.....<br />  Sorry about that.  I promised myself I would never do that.  I can't seem to help myself.  This might be the most excited I have ever been about a movie since seeing "Star Wars" nearly 32 years ago.  Not even "Lord of the Rings" got me this stoked (and I love that series).  I read an interview with Director, Jon Favreau in the Detroit Free Press.  He described his initial meeting with ILM at their facilities.  In a conference room full of ILM staff and notables he uttered these words; "I hate CGI".  As you would guess they were quite stunned.  It's because of this attitude that Favreau is quickly becoming my favorite Hollywood Director ( "Zathura" was also surprisingly good).  His belief in using practical effects whenever possible is leading to more realistic and believable films than most of his peers.  Of course, his desire to see really cool and smart movies (like most people) does not hurt.  He really has faith in his audience and it pays off tremendously.<br /><br />THIS FILM ROCKS!!<br />  Pardon me!!  MAN, 0 for 2!  I'm being completely honest when I say this; by the time Stark invents his first "Iron" suit to break out of his prison, this had already become my favorite live action superhero movie.  That was roughly half way through.  The film could have ended there and I would have been completely satisfied.  But wait, there is so much more.  We spend the next 3rd of the film watching him transform technically and personally, and it is a joy.  But wait, there is more.  We get to laugh at his failures and impulsive behavior, and it is a joy.  But wait, there is more.  He starts to save the world, one person at a time and it is spectacular and... ...it is a joy.  But wait!!  Well, you get the picture.  By the time the final climactic battle comes around, you might think it was unnecessary; however, it is a joy<br /><br />THIS FILM ROCKS!!!<br />OK!!  Now it's just getting annoying!!  Despite the great visual FX and the outstanding action and nearly perfect story, it is the characters that make this film.  I have never been a huge fan of any of the actors in this film.  I thought they were ok but never was too wowed.  Now, I am having a serious case of man-love for Robert Downey Jr.. I thought his casting as Tony Stark was a good idea before seeing the film.  Now I'm convinced it was pure genius.  Gwyneth Paltrow's secondary role as Pepper Potts (assistant savant) actually stood out.  She brought a huge amount of depth and realism to a fringe character; impressive.  The rest of the characters/actors were equally believable and performed above my expectations.  Again, I think this speaks of masterful direction.<br /><br />THIS FILM RO....<br />That's enough!!  This is the first solo film production from Marvel Entertainment.  HUGE KUDOS!!  They obviously know their core product much better than the Hollywood regulars.  They recently announced their plans through 2011.  In the next few years we will get to see a new and hopefully better Hulk, Captain America, Mighty Thor, more Iron Man and Nick Fury; Agent of SHEILD.  All of these films will be connected in some way and seem to be pointing at a culmination in an "Avengers" film.  If Marvel keep their focus and stick to what worked so brilliantly in "Iron Man" we are all in for a real treat!!<br /><br />A WORD TO PARENTS<br />There is one sex scene in this film.  It's a bit rough (physically speaking). Though no real nudity occurs it might be more than you'd like your kids to see.  Some of the violence could be too intense for younger or sensitive kids<br /><br />Did I mention that THIS FILM ROCKS!?!?!?  Just checking.</p></body></html>

Through the few clues that he can piece together, he begins the quest to find out who he is, and he's not too pleased at what he finds out.  By his side is a German woman who helps him escape imminent danger by giving him a ride to Paris.  This is a fast-paced, exciting movie that keeps the viewer's attention.  My main objections lie with the casting of All-American boy Matt Damon as a cold-blooded killer and the fact that without knowledge of the book, it's difficult to follow the CIA wheels within wheels.  Still, it's an entertaining movie.</p></body></html>

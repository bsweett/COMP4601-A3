<meta name="summary" content=""A Revealing Movie Of How A Monster Came To Be""></head><body><p>If your a fan of "The Silence of the Lambs" you must purchase this movie. "Hannibal Rising" depicts the story of Hannibal Lecter during his younger years, from a small boy who watched his parents die and his sister being eaten alive by neanderthalls, to a beautiful looking young man with revenge on his mind. This revenge is what makes Lecter into the monster that he became: it takes over his life like an addiction that he cannot break away from. There is always a reason behind one's behavior, even if that behavior means murdering people: this film explores all of this and more.<br /> Gasparo Ulliel, who plays Lecter, gives a virtuoso performance, and I am sure Anthony Perkins is proud that such a talented and gifted actor gave new life into the most haunting movie villin of all-time.<br /> Thomas Harris, who wrote the original "Silence of the Lambs", wrote the screenplay for "Hannibal Rising". An impeccable script.<br /> The DVD is outstanding, with deleted scenes, commentary by the director Peter Webber and producer Martha DeLaurentis, teaser and theatrical trailers, and the documentaries "Hannibal Lecter: The Origin of Evil" and "Designing Horror and Elegance".<br /> The film is beautifully filmed in Europe.<br /> The critics say it all: Joel Siegel, from "Good Morning America" states, "if you can keep your eyes opened, your going to be scared", and Pete Hammond, of "Maxim" says, the film is "a fascinating and terrifying journey into the making of a monster".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""The world is an evil place, Charlie.  Some of us make money off of that.  Others get destroyed...""></head><body><p>"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is one of the best movies to come out of 2007.  It's involving, thrilling and even at times terrifying to see how normal everyday people can do terrible and unimaginable things.  It's also a film that shows you that nothing is ever simple and even what seems to be the most simple or "victimless" crime can lead to devastating consequences that can shatter lives.<br /><br />"Victimless."  That's exactly the term Andy uses when he explains to his brother how they can get some easy cash.  Both are in desperate need of money.  Andy says that there is a solution to all of their problems, and that is to hit a mom-and-pop jewelery store that they both know very well.  No guns will be used.  No cops will be called.  And most importantly, nobody will get hurt.  How can it go wrong?  Very wrong, that's how.  Wrong as in that people do get hurt and that the aftermath can lead to the destruction of an already damaged family in the gripping melodrama that goes to show you just how evil the world can be sometimes.<br /><br />Not a moment went by where I didn't find myself hooked.  Not a minute went by where I could predict what was going to happen next.  That's a real treat when you are in the presence of a confident film that won't resort to the usual cliches or predictable twists and turns.  The writing and performances are outstanding.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman gives one of his best and darkest performances as a man who can be so manipulative and cold, yet you sense that there is a longing for love and acceptance that he has inside of him that wasn't shown to him when he was younger.  Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney are also terrific and deserve high praises.<br /><br />There is a risk that comes with a film like this, and that is the fact that there will be a lot of people who won't like it.  It's very dark, depressing and even gives you a sense of hopelessness that things can ever be good for these characters.  But, because this movie is so well executed, it makes you want to take the trip even if it's not a joyful one.  The DVD includes cast and crew commentary, a theatrical trailer and a making of featurette.<br /><br />I have seen this film many times now, and it never loses its power and emotion for me.  True, "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is not for everybody, but it is a remarkable film that deserves to be seen.  If you're looking for a crime story where you actually care about the characters, as flawed as they may be, then this may be the one for you. -Michael Crane</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What do we know and when did we know it..."></head><body><p>Wasn't <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CDL93">JFK</a> a great movie?  Sure, there was some artistic license taken here and there by Director Oliver Stone.  Actually, quite a lot!  But there were JUST ENOUGH snippets of truth to make you, the viewer, think that this was a plausible course of events.<br /><br />Then came W.  Same pattern... snippets of truth and gobs of speculation.<br /><br />But why not?  In lieu of having actual documentation about the care and feeding of George W. Bush (played well by Josh Brolin) and the development of his political career, we have... speculation.  Oh, and Oliver Stone can speculate.  BOY, can he speculate!<br /><br />I think Bush detractors will give this movie a thumbs-up, and Bush supporters will give it a thumbs-down.  As a movie, however, it was fascinating, engaging, and engrossing.  It's the Republican-bashing version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783227973">Primary Colors</a>.<br /><br />And since we shouldn't only be exposed to the movies and books which already mirror our worldviews, W. should be seen, and discussed, by many.<br /><br />The conversation afterwards will be... interesting.</p></body></html>

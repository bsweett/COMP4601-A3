<meta name="summary" content="Baseball - Numbers vs. Instinct"></head><body><p>I love movies, all kinds of movies, but sports genre movies aren't usually my first choice.  But I liked "Moneyball" very much.  It's loosely based on the true life story of General Manager Billy Beane and the Oakland A's baseball team.<br /><br />I'm always a sucker for an underdog story and I like unusual, offbeat movies so this was a win-win for me.  Brad Pitt was low key in the role of Beane, playing the GM/ex-baseball player - a maverick, going against tradition and hiring players by numbers rather than an arcane convoluted instinctual system that had been used previously.<br /><br />My favorite in the movie is Jonah Hill, playing Yale graduate, Peter Brand, who had majored in economics and uses a complex system of statistics to rank ball players.  He is hired to be Beane's assistant GM.  This is a much more serious role for Hill than I've seen him in before and in my opinion, it's his performance that makes the movie a success.<br /><br />I also liked the Good Ole Boy scouts and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Art Howe, the team manager.<br /><br />Good story, great casting, some unnecessary family moments - all-in-all a sports movie that I enjoyed and will probably watch again in the future.<br /><br />(Oh - I did like Beane's daughter in the movie, Kerris Dorsey, singing "The Show" sung previously by Lenka.  Good song and Dorsey does an admirable job on it.)<br /><br />As an extra on the DVD was also a segment that has the real Billy Beane talking about reinventing the game - liked that, too.</p></body></html>

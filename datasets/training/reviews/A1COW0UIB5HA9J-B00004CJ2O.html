<meta name="summary" content="A Classic slasher the way it was meant to be seen!"></head><body><p>In 1957, a young boy named Jason Voorhees drowned in Camp Crystal Lake then a year later some camp counslors were horribly murdered mysteriously. Now in 1979, the camp is about to reopen thanks to a new owner Steve (Peter Brouwer) with counselors but suddenly a mysterious killer is murder each of them, one by bloody one until one survives to reveal who the true killer is.<br /><br />Co-starring Kevin Bacon, Adrienne King, Laurie Bartham, Mark Nelson, Robbin Morgan, Harry Crosby and Betsy Palmer. This is a unique and stylish slasher shocker that started off as an idea by Victor Miller based off campfire legends including the legend of Cropsy the killer which was later made as "The Burning" and influenced by films by "Halloween" and "Psycho", Sean S. Cunningham who produced the 1972 sleaze-feast "Last House on The Left" produced and directed the project to make it low budget. Made in 1979 then finished in 1980,it opened up on june 13th 1980 distributed by Paramount Pictures to become one of the highest grossing movies at the box-office that year despite bad reviews including Roger Ebert who declared it nothing but a "Halloween" rip-off. What makes the movie so effective is the "Psycho"-esque score by Harry Manfredini and of course the memorable gore effects by Tom Savini which shocked the daylights out of people when it first came out yet they are still effective. Although Jason isn't the true killer in this movie, even though he does appear in a couple of sequences and doesn't become the villain until the sequels, the film offers scares and shocks from beginning to end as it spawned sequels, imitators, a slew of trick or treaters with Jason costumes and a remake in the works, it even paved way for "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and other slasher movies of the 80's.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray brings us for the first time in the U.S. the uncut unrated version with more violent footage that was toned down to avoid an "X" rating originally. It offers great picture and sound quality in the best high definition possible with great extras like interviews, featurettes, a reunion at a horror convention, "Tales from Camp Blood part 1" Short film, audio commentary and theatrical trailer.</p></body></html>

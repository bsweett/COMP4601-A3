There is plenty of funny and touching moments in this film to make it worthwhile watching, especially the the three leads perfectly fit their roles in this film that deals with dysfunctional sisterhood, history of family feuds, forgiveness, and reconcilation. I must say that initially I was drawn to seeing this film for Shirley MacLaine and my favorite Austrilian actress Toni Collette, but I was quite impressed by Cameron Diaz whom I had little expectation for as a serious actress. To my surprise, this is probably her most striking performance since Being John Malkovich. Guys will get to see enough of her wearing skimpy outfits, underwears, and bikinis. I guess that's part of the whole commercial selling point, no wonder she receives top billing and she's the only one on the poster.<br /><br />The movie starts with Maggie Feller(Cameron Diaz) in the middle of a foreplay scene with a former classmate at her high school reunion. She was too drunk to even have sex in the first place, and ended up passing out in the washroom. Her sister Rose(Toni Collette) was summoned to pick her up and take her back to her father's house, but ended up getting kicked out by the mean stepmother. So it was Rose' turn to take her in as her new roomate, but they ended up gettting on each other's nerves since they had nothing in common. At one point, Maggie says,"I'll do your makeup if you do my resume." Rose is overweight and could care less about her image, and she's a total workaholic. One would wonder how the heck does Rose' sexy and hunky boss Jim(Richard Burgi) was interested in her in the first place. She's so inexperienced sexually and romantically, which is the opposite of her promiscuous sister. Richard Burgi is somewhat wasted with minimal screentime, but he did get to show off his ultra-muscular body. The breaking point between the sisters take place when Jim cheats on Rose with Maggie. That's where they verbally and physically attack each other.<br /><br />The homeless and jobless Maggie went back to her father's house for one more time to steal some cash and accidently discovered letters written from her obsentee grandmother Ella(Shirley MacLaine) whom she thought had died years ago. She then headed to Miami to track down her uninformed grandmother. Ella was very delighted and surprised by her visit. She eventually shared with Maggie the secrets, lies, and feuds between her daughter, son-in-law, and her before she had to abandon the family. At this point, Maggie starts to reflect on life and makes changes to improve herself. She had to move beyond her imature and crazy old self and take life more serious. She takes the job as a caretaker for the seniors and for the first time she's sober and clean. Meanwhile, Rose is falling in love with her ex-collegue from the law firm. Her first official boyfriend Simon Stein(Mark Feuerstein) had a crush on her since day one. She had no idea where Maggie had gone and she starts to worry and miss her. Then she receives an unexpected letter from her grandmother.......<br /><br />Cameron Diaz looks very sexy and beautiful in this film and she had the most amount screentime, but her role is not as dramatic and challenging as Toni Collette's. I guess one gets to deliver serve as the eye-candy and the other gets to be emotionally affecting. I really enjoyed their fight scenes together, because I can totally relate to what it's like to not get along with your siblings. Shirley MacLaine's role is somewhat low-key, and she had merely a few funny and touchy moments opposite Diaz and Collette. Her performance was so subtle and believable that I just wished she had more screentime to work with. The verdict: this film did make me laugh a lot, it almost make me cry, and it made me smile in the end.</p></body></html>

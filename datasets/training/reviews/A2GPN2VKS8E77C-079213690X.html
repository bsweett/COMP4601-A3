<meta name="summary" content=""Every Man Dies, Not Every Man Really Lives." William Wallace. Rebel. Lover. Patriot."></head><body><p>Mel Gibson's epic film "Braveheart" won 5 Academy Awards, including Best Picture & Best Director. The film earned those Oscars because it was done so well: the mammoth scope of the events in history, as well as the historical figures (however little may be the material that we know about their lives) demanded a sprawling budget and a running time reminiscent of epic movies like "Ben-Hur," "Sparatacus," "Doctor Zhivago," etc. Like "Spartacus" and, more recently, "Valkyrie," this film has a strong message of standing up for what you believe, even in the face of certain death, but "They'll remember you." Wallace fought and died for what he believed in.On 22 July 1706 the Treaty of Union was agreed between representatives of the Scots Parliament and the Parliament of England and the following year twin Acts of Union were passed by both parliaments to create the united Kingdom of Great Britain with effect from 1 May 1707 (source:[...]). Take heed of the film's R rating, though: The violence is brutal and intense, which is absolutely neccessary for a story like this. FREEDOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p></body></html>

It's hard to believe that this film came out over a decade ago and yet the advances it made in special effects are still influencing films today.  I won't waste much time on describing the plot because just about everyone already knows what happens.  For those not so inclined, here's a brief run-through:  Scientist screws with dino-DNA, clones a few of the beasts for an amusement park/zoo, needs legal and scientific approval, Newman steals information and shuts the entire park down, people begin to die, the surviviors attempt to escape.<br /><br />Now that you have an idea of what is going on, just know that this is one of the most suspenseful films made in the last twenty years.  It features a wonderful cast headed up by Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum.  Richard Attenborough turns in a wonderful performance as the park's visionary creator and Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello play his very eager grandchildren.  In fact, Mazzello almost steals the show with his constant bickering over the facts in Dr. Grant's (Neill) book on dinosaurs being related to birds.<br /><br />Since its creation, I have yet to see a film influence movie-making as much as this one did.  The special effects are almost flawless.  The action is thrilling and suspenseful and the sound is amazing.  Even the cinematography provides some stunning visuals for the viewer.  Speilberg outdid himself with this one.<br /><br />If you purchase only one film from the nineties, this is the one to buy.  It was followed by two sequels, the horrible "The Lost World" and the popcorn friendly "Jurassic Park III," but both pale in comparison to this original classic.<br /><br />Highly recommended to ALL fans of cinema.  I don't care if you're a lover of Westerns, Comedies, Sci-Fi, etc.  This one film is one of the best of all time.</p></body></html>

I know the ratings system has changed over the years, but even the classic line, "Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!" should have bumped it up to PG, no?<br /><br />Charlton Heston was at his best in the "last man" role, and is perfect here. (creepy laugh and all) And was there a more beautiful woman in 1968 than Linda Harrison (Nova)? She had been a beauty pageant winner and runner-up in the 1965 Miss USA. She must not have spoken well or else surely she would have found more work in Hollywood.<br /><br />I've been tempted to purchase the 6-disc collection, although it can be had for quite a bit cheaper on the UK amazon, where it's called the The Planet of the Apes Collection (6 Disk Box Set). In the meantime, the one I'm reviewing is the one to have. It comes with three commentaries so I can't understand why anyone would pay more than twice as much for the more recent 35th Anniversary Edition:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000TPA4C">Planet of the Apes (Widescreen 35th Anniversary Edition)</a></p></body></html>

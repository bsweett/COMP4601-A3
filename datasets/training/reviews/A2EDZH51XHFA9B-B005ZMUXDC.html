And yet I have to give them credit where credit is due. Disney pretty much holds a lock on naked emotional manipulation through cute anthropomorphic animals (in this case, a chameleon and a horse, who play straight men to the female and male, respectively, romantic leads) and songs that sound like they were written after the consultation of what's-hip trend reports, rather than being from the heart. All of which is a long way of saying that I really liked &lt;em>Tangled&lt;/em>, though I hate myself for really liking it, and I understand all the reasons why I shouldn't like it. But there it is.<br /><br />Plot: loosely based on the Rapunzel fairy tale, so the main character's name, Rapunzel (teen singing sensation Mandy Moore), make perfect sense. As we open, Rapunzel is stolen from the royal crib by an evil old witch, Gothel (&lt;em>Spider-Man 2&lt;/em>'s Donna Murphy), because the royal guard harvested the flower Gothel uses to keep herself young to try and save the queen's baby in the womb. Which worked, obviously, but now the magic of the flower can only be found in Rapunzel's hair... as long as it's not cut. Fast-forward umpteen years, as we're never quite sure how old Rapunzel is in the bulk of the film, and Rapunzel, who has never left Gothel's hidden tower, is bored, restless, wants to see the world, and has seventy-foot-long hair that provides the only entrance to Gothel's tower. Not that anyone but Gothel needs it, and she only goes out for monthly trips to the market. Enter Flynn Rider (&lt;em>Chuck&lt;/em>'s Zachary Levi), a small-time crook on the run both from the law--in the persona of Maximus, a horse of the royal guard who kept up the hunt when the humans abandoned it--and his former associates, whom Rider left to be captured, getting away with their latest acquisition--the royal tiara. While hiding, Rider stumbles into the hidden valley where Gothel's tower is located while she's off to market, touching off a long string of events that lead to, well, all the stuff you expect from a Disney princess film.<br /><br />It's all phenomenally cute, and you can't help but admire the animation, which co-director Byron Howard envisioned as a blend of traditional Disney animation and CGI (and how they pulled it off I'm not sure I will ever know). And yet there's always a voice in the back of my head telling me exactly how much I'm being manipulated by every last aspect of this film. To its credit, &lt;em>Tangled&lt;/em>, like most Disney films, is absolutely transparent about this, and so I guess I should give it points for honesty. I definitely give it points for the fact that I just don't care as much as I should about how certain minor characters are there just to advance the plot, and that whole "the songs sound like they were written by committee" thing; if you're going to hire a major recording star, why not let her write her own stuff? (And the switch some years ago from hiring straight voice actors to hiring major stars is a whole other rant in itself, and it's infuriating, and I'll stop now or we'll be here all day on that subject.)<br /><br />And yet despite all that I'm attacking all the things about the movie that SHOULD be attacked is how much I enjoyed the silly thing. Yes, it's predictable, as predictable as any Disney princess movie, and yes, you will know from the outset this film is manipulating you (the first line of spoken dialogue, from Flynn Rider's voiceover: "this is the story of how I died."), and it doesn't matter one bit. No matter how hard you resist, you will be assimilated, at least for the hour and a half it takes to watch this movie. *** ?</p></body></html>

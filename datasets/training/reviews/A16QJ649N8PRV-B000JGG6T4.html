<meta name="summary" content="A Top Notch Thriller"></head><body><p>This intense action thriller is great from start to finish.<br /><br />It features Denzel Washington as Creasy, a burnt out alcoholic ex-CIA agent type.  He has gotten to the point where he is just existing and does not seem to see much point in living.  His friend gets him a job as a bodyguard to a young girl, Pita (Dakota Fanning), in kidnapping capital Mexico City.<br /><br />Although he clearly views it as just a job and wants no conversation or other personal involvement, she starts to grow on him and he warms to her.<br /><br />She ends up getting kidnapped.  Creasy is wounded during the kidnapping.  While he is recovering, he finds out that a ransom exchange went bad and it becomes clear that Pita's abductors plan to kill her.  Creasy becomes totally fixed on revenge against anyone who was involved.  He functions like he is half Jack Bauer and half Dirty Harry.  Needless to say, the action is constant.  Not only is there a lot of violence and excitement, there is also a good human story about the father-like relationship Creasy develops with Pita.<br /><br />This is really a great flick, but probably not one for those who are too squeamish about violence</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="More than a great mystery--a great tragic love poem."></head><body><p>All true movie fans have a scene from a movie that, for them, represents the pinnacle of cinematic art; for me, it's the scene where Scotty Ferguson, having remade Judy Barton into the image of the lost Madeline Elster, sees Judy dressed and coiffed as Madeline for the first time. The spectral apparition of the lost love reclaimed, like a ghost from the mists of eternity, has an emotional impact like no other scene in the cinema. Tragic, obsessive love is a staple of literature, but not so much one of movies, which after all must have happy endings to keep people buying tickets. Alfred Hitchcock gambled on tragedy with Vertigo, and lost the original bet insofar as ticket sales and critical comment ran in 1958; but he won the ultimate battle with posterity. Like a great novel or epic poem, Vertigo has layer upon layer of meaning and nuance that can be unveiled only by successive viewings. It's redundant now--but still vitally necessary--to praise the powerful performances of James Stewart, Kim Novak, and Barbara Bel Geddes; the swirling, hypnotic photography of Robert Burks; the haunting music of Bernard Herrmann, in what must surely be the greatest film score ever composed; and, of course, the genius who brought them all together to make &quot;Vertigo,&quot; my nomination for the greatest film of all time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""We're a rescue team, not assassins""></head><body><p>Maybe they should have sent assassins.<br /><br />In 1987's Predator, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Dutch, a major in charge of a rescue team who handles the missions no one else can handle.  When he is called on by his good friend Apollo Creed aka the General to find a missing cabinet minister who is lost in the jungle, he thinks it's because he's the best.  He has no idea it's because this is really a suicide mission wherein they will be hunted by a sci-fi creature in the jungle who can blend in with the woods, has heat seeking guns on his shoulders, and hops from tree to tree like a monkey.<br /><br />For some reason, this is the first time I've seen this movie and now that I've seen it, I'm a bit angry it took me so long.  Predator is Schwarzenegger in his heyday--all brawn, accent, and arrogance.  His team is just as impressive with a tracker who can sense the danger in the jungle, a tobacco-chewing redneck who "ain't got time to bleed," and, of course, Apollo Creed as the guy who got them all into this mess.<br /><br />If you haven't seen Predator, this collector's edition is definitely the way to go.  Not only does it have a sneak peek at Alien v. Predator, but it has an entire disc of extras with behind the scenes featurettes, outtakes, deleted scenes, etc.  I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys sction/adventure and sci-fi movies; it's the best of both worlds.</p></body></html>

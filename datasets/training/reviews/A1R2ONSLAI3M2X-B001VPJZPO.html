<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Good Movie...."></head><body><p>Living in Louisiana myself, I was excited to see this film. I was not disappointed. Even though not a "horror" movie, this movie is a good thriller and delivers alot of suspense. Kate Hudson plays the part very well. The filming of the movie was tastefully done giving everyone a little glimpse of the Louisiana Bayous!! The movie keeps you  interested from beginning to end and keeps you wondering what's next. Definetly worth watching. You will not get bored.</p></body></html>

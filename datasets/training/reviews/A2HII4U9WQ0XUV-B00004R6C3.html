<meta name="summary" content="Oh but Baby, it's Cold outside!"></head><body><p>The US government, through its SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) project, spends millions---maybe tens of millions---beaming out welcome wagon signals to the far corners of the cosmos, in hopes of triggering a response from some hermit neighbor along the rim of Betelgeuse or Aldebaran, or perhaps from some wispy settlement near a gas giant in the baffling neighborhood of Andromeda.<br /><br />Tens of millions of taxpayer bucks, all in the hope of luring something from Outside---well, luring It here, to Earth.<br /><br />But judging from Earth's popular imagination when it comes to our space-faring, gallivanting extraterrestrial buddies, you'd think maybe they would be wise to let sleeping---ummm, Things---lie.<br /><br />From the skin-shucking intergalactic space-cockroaches of LV428 in "Alien" to the terraforming "Earth First! We'll strip-mine the rest of the planets later" cephalopods of "War of the Worlds", our writers, dreamers, moviemakers and other prophets have viewed the prospect of Alien company with a decidedly gimlet eye.<br /><br />Which brings us to John Carpenter's uber-bada** romp "The Thing", one of the greatest horror flicks---strike that, greatest films---of all time, as well as a fine cautionary tale about the wisdom of leaving the space heater on when you're babysitting a mutagenic horror hauled from deep space, particularly one lodged in a block of ice.<br /><br />Space Heater + Hungry, Shape-shifting Alien = Bad.<br /><br />All of which is bad news for the boys at the US Antarctic Research station, whose fun-filled existence of sitting around in thermal underwear, b*tching about government grant money and playing rustic Atari computer chess is shattered by a bunch of crazy Norwegians in a helicopter shooting at a dog.<br /><br />Crazy damned Norwegians.<br /><br />But since this is called "The Thing" and not "Those Crazy Dog-Shooting Norwegians"---well, you guessed it, something's not quite right with Fido: he gets cuddled, fed, and mixed in with the general puppy population, and before you can say "Roll Over! Play Dead" it becomes apparent that the boys from the Antarctic base aren't gonna be winning any Kennel Club awards this year.<br /><br />Things take a slightly more sinister turn when chopper pilot MacReady (the great Kurt Russell, letting the growl and the beard do the acting, and boasting a truly bada** sombrero) and a wonky scientist compadre head over to the Norwegian base (presumably to return charred pieces of the Norwegian helicopter and/or Norwegian scientists to their grieving buddies).<br /><br />Let's do a Cliff's Notes here: the Norwegian base is dead, mainly deserted---aside from a few scientists who slit their own throats and wrists rather than deal with---well, that's the question, isn't it?<br /><br />Oh, and there's a big pallet of ice in the research lab, where something---large---was being kept under observation. And some videotapes of those Crazy Norwegians in happier days forming a merry circle around what appears to be a flying saucer, buried in the ice.<br /><br />Now: whatever it was in that ice-cube made it out, but it didn't get far. There's a big splatty mess of char-broiled thing spread-eagle in the snow outside the base camp, and boy howdy it's a Beaut---big nasty mandibles, spindly vestigial arms, at least three eye-sockets---every shape under the Sun, except a happy-phone-home-glow-in-the-dark-finger E.T.<br /><br />So naturally, they haul it back to the American research station. You know, man, like, to study it and sh*t.<br /><br />Their loss is our gain: faster than you can say "is that a pseudopod in your pants or are you just happy to see me?", things go rapidly---psychotically---from bad to batsh*t crazy.<br /><br />Oh, and very, sincerely, atrociously goopy-gory. FX Wizard-in-Training Rob Bottin was just 22 years old back then, and he conjured up some of the sickest, barf-inducing effects known to man, all sorts of practical, sleight-of-hand, prosthetic goodies that make today's pallid CGI geek-artists cry Mommy. It's splendidly filthy stuff: if your stomach can make it past "The Thing", you're pretty much good to go.<br /><br />But the glory of "The Thing" isn't really about the gore---delicious as that may be. It's about the loneliness, for one: the vulnerability of this little evolved monkey, Man, taking tests, collecting data, *collating*, man---on this forsaken, ice-haunted island of solitude on a still lonelier little chunk of rock tucked into a backwater of the Milky Way.<br /><br />Unvisited, until now.<br /><br />"The Thing" is a masterwork of a film---Carpenter doesn't sound a false note, and every scene, every sequence, every delicious, paranoid little sliver of this flick tells: not one second of celluloid is padding. It's a veteran character actor's Happy Hunting Ground, too, and every one of the lonely, wonky scientists---including vets Wilford Brimley (axe-wielding Blair) and Richard Dysart (Doc Copper), and bad-when-bad-wasn't-cool Keith David (Childs)---all flesh out skeletal roles with groovy little quirks that, when all is said and done, could just be the quirks of stir-crazy eggheads---or...<br /><br />"The Thing" is a gut-clenching nugget of pure paranoid goodness: pop it in the hopper, break out the vodka, haul the blankets up to your chin while the arctic wind howls outside, and wonder for the 10th time tonight why the hell the cat is looking at you like *that*.<br /><br />Oh, and cut the space heater off.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

If you answered yes drop everything and go see this movie now.  I have been increasingly blown away by the quality filmmaking Pixar has brought to cinemas over the past decade, but The Incredibles marks the first time I've been overwhelmed.  Everything you've ever loved about superheroes is addressed in this film, from secret identities to the danger of wearing a cape.  Add to the mix an amazingly complex family drama and you have the absolute best film of the year.<br /><br />Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), once the super hero of the year is now relegated to a cubicle in an insurance company, still trying to save the day (quietly) one claim at a time.  His wife, Helen, a.k.a Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) has also turned in her spandex, using her special powers to juggle the task of raising three kids instead of wrangling villains.  Their son, Dash, wants nothing more than to use his super speed to propel him to athletic glory. Violet, who has the ability to turn invisible and enclose her self within a forcefield broods like any normal teenager.  The baby, Jack Jack doesn't seem to have any super powers at all, unless you include making funny faces in a high chair.<br /><br />All of this is due to a Super Hero relocation program enacted by the government after public outcry over property damage and personal injury( a very sharp and poignant jab at our own litigious nature).  Forced to hide greatness behind a shroud of mediocrity the Incredible family do their best to blend in with normal society, and for the most part succeed.<br /><br />Of course events unfold to bring all of the Incredibles super powers to light, and for this to occur you need to introduce the mad genius villain, Syndrome (Jason Lee).  Parents, here's where the PG rating comes from, because this is one really, really bad guy.  A former superhero fan with an enormous chip on his shoulder Syndrome is like every James Bond baddie rolled into one.  His gadgets are unique, insanely cool, and above all extremely deadly.  Some dark thematic elements and violence cemented the MPAA's decision to slap Pixar with its first above G rating.  However, this movie could not have been done properly without giving the audience such a nefarious nemesis to loathe.<br /><br />In costume and out you will constantly root for the Incredibles, this movie is what going to the theater is all about, non-stop entertainment.  The action sequences are positively synapse blowing.  The script is Oscar worthy in its ability to seamlessly weave domestic drama and comic book daring-do.  Of course the animation has to be seen to be believed, and your eyes will bulge for the film's duration.<br /><br />I can't imagine this film not being successful but I hope it destroys box office records and mends the wound that has Pixar and Disney going their separate ways.  Because if ever there was a film that demanded a sequel it is The Incredibles.  An animation masterpiece!</p></body></html>

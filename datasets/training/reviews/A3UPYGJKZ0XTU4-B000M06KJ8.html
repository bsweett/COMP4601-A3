<meta name="summary" content="Stylized Presentation Suits the Queen's Youth, but Falls Short as She Ages."></head><body><p>Director Sofia Coppola continues her focus on emotionally frustrated young women in her third feature film, "Marie Antoinette", adapted from Antonia Fraser's popular biography of the last Queen of France who met her end at the guillotine. This film will do nothing to resolve the debate over the director's talent or lack thereof, since Ms. Coppola has chosen to make a stylized, candied presentation of already controversial characters in a politically complex 18th century context that the French take pretty seriously. Its purpose is partly to rehabilitate Marie Antoinette's image in the eyes of Americans, who tend to regard her as a wastrel with contempt for the common people. Having studied this period of history while in France, I can say that the French view Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette as the least  to blame for France's economic crisis and Revolution.<br /><br />In 1768, to cement an alliance between Austria and France, the Empress Maria Theresa betroths her youngest daughter to the French Dauphin. The 14-year-old, trepidatious Archduchess (Kirsten Dunst) marries the shy prince (Jason Schwartzman), only slightly older than herself, and becomes Marie Antoinette, Dauphine of France. In addition to the loss of privacy and oppressive protocols of the French court, the young Dauphine is expected to produce an heir. Yet her husband, though kind and respectful, won't have sex with her. In 1774, King Louis XV dies and his son ascends the throne as Louis XVI, making Marie Antoinette Queen of France. Years of pressure to consummate her marriage finally end with the birth of a daughter. But France has huge debts, bread shortages, and revolutionaries do all they can to paint the King and Queen as villains.<br /><br />"Marie Antoinette" is self-consciously eye candy. It's a baroque visual feast of crisp, vivid pastels. There is little dialogue. Marie Antoinette's life at Versailles is expressed visually through a dynamic camera that seems to float, sumptuous production design, and countless scenes of the Queen and courtiers doing nothing of importance. It's not about matters of state. This is a kind of prolonged vignette illustrating the humiliation, confinement, and extraordinary luxuries that defined Marie Antoinette's lifestyle, and how this effusive, affectionate woman coped with it all, successfully or not. The sets, costumes, and hair styles are stylizations, not intended to be entirely accurate but to convey the kid-in-a-candy-store indulgence with which Marie Antoinette consoled herself in the years before she had children.<br /><br />This all works well until Marie Antoinette becomes a mother at age 23. As she aged, the Queen mostly abandoned her spendthrift ways and tried to sacrifice for France to the extent that a person so isolated could. The film tries awkwardly to express this and ends up being rather muddled. Two of her children died. The tone of Marie Antoinette's life changed. The tone of the film doesn't. The inclusion of her alleged affair with Count Ferson seems incongruous. The result is that the film's second half is unclear and ineffectual. Where a broad emotional portrait of her life at Versailles allows unique insight into Marie Antoinette's youth, her later life cannot be understood without more structured and intricate storytelling.<br /><br />Liberties taken with details and design aside, I expect French viewers will dislike "Marie Antoinette" on the basis of language alone. The French language reached its height in the late 18th century, and the ability to speak cleverly and beautifully was highly prized at Court. But words in this film are simple and sparse. It has been definitely established that dialogue is not Sofia Coppola's forte. But her intention here is to shift focus away from manners and onto emotions, which may be appropriate. I think "Marie Antoinette" succeeds as a fresh, innovative way to understand this ill-fated Queen's emotional life up to a point. But the MTV-inspired style is less suitable as Marie Antoinette ages and she exchanges old pressures for new. 3 ? stars.<br /><br />The DVD (Sony 2007): There are 2 deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer (2 ? min), a theatrical teaser (1 ? min), and 2 featurettes. "The Making of Marie Antoinette" (25 min) features on-set interviews with the cast, behind-the-scenes footage, discussions of the film's themes with Sofia Coppola, and interviews with the film's creative team about production and costume design, colors, lighting, and more. In "Cribs with Louis XVI" (3 ? min) Jason Schwartzman takes us on a tour of his palace at Versailles in the style of MTV's "Cribs". Subtitles are available for the film in English and French. Dubbing available in French.</p></body></html>

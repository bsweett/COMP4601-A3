<meta name="summary" content="Middle age crisis but tilted sideways!"></head><body><p>Alexander Payne is fast becoming one of the most interesting film directors in the business. His previous films Election and About Schmidt are light social commentary comedies. His latest, Sideways, is no different.<br /><br />Sideways tells the story of two middle aged men, one a middle school Social Studies teacher named Miles Raymond played by Paul Giamatti, and the other an actor named Jack played by Thomas Haden Church. Jack is supposedly getting married in a week, while Miles is still suffering from a two year old divorce. The two men go on a trip through the wine counties of California on a wine-tasting tour that Miles is an expert at. Along the way, they meet the humble, charming waitress Maya, played by Virginia Madsen, and the wild single mother Stephanie, played by Sandra Oh. Jack has a dirty plan of enjoying one last sexual fling before he ties the knot and at the same time show his depressed buddy Miles that life is still worth looking into and enjoying by trying to hook him up with Maya. Miles becomes outraged with Jack's disloyalty and at the same time his own struggles to fall in love again.<br /><br />With funny dialogue and the Alexander Payne style of realism, Sideways succeeds in making a connection with the audience. Even if you are not a middle aged person, you will still enjoy watching Church and Giamatti in their ridiculous and sometimes absurd shenanigans.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Unremarkable Story, But Stan Winston Gives One Notch Up"></head><body><p>The plot is a familiar one: several hapless people, mostly young couples in love, are lost among the deep wilds (like West Virginia), and wish that they shouldn't leave their home.  For it is the place haunted by ... er ... man-eating 'mountain men.'  Right?<br /><br />So, these unlucky people are Desmond Harrington, Eliza Dushku, Emmanuelle Chiriqui, Jeremy Sisto, Lindy Booth, and Kevin Zegers.  Not great acting from any of them, but all just adequate.  Strangely, Eliza Dushku, who looks very sexy on and out of screen, does not look so in this film.<br /><br />Anyway, they run for their life in the deep forest, and the photography (actually done in Canada) succeeds in capturing the sinister feelings of the place.  Maybe, somewhere in these thick forests, you might meet canibals weilding hatchets, and the images, with the good production designs, almost make us believe in their presence.  Almost.<br /><br />If I am not mistaken, this is the first film produced by make-up wizard Stan Winston, who must have experienced lots of sadness in the past, seeing his great works wasted in bad films.  Though 'Wrong Turn' is not the perfect showcase for his ingenious art, it is still a good starting point, where he again displays his skills in the gory, grotesque face-make ups of the man-eaters.<br /><br />Even the die-hard fans must admit that what you see in 'Wrong Turn' you have seen in other films of the genre.  But for all its familiarity, 'Wrong Turn' is not a bad film.  It may still be a waste of time for some people, sure, but I wasted my time (if I ever did) not in a bad way.</p></body></html>

Borat was fun to watch as he made his way through the United States looking for people to agitate, disgust, anger, etc.  However, in this film, "Borat:  Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Cohen runs the comedy well dry.  The scripted moments of this film were the weakest points in the movie.  **SPOILERS**  The incident with the bear, the bickering with his producer, and the lonely nights pining for Pamela Anderson were lukewarm at best.  I will say that the celebrated "naked fight" is very, very funny and is actually a highlight of the film.  However, Cohen is at his best when he confronts people in candid moments.  Be it at a church service, in the company of drunken frat boys, or at the dinner table, Cohen knows how to get funny (or at least brutally honest) responses from those he encounters.  These types of interactions show just how cruel, ignorant, kind, proud, forgiving, or oblivious people can be when put into certain situations.<br /><br />**End Spoilers**<br /><br />The film itself is okay, but it's nothing more than an overdone "Borat" skit that is best taken in small doses.  The DVD provides a few deleted scenes (some of the best being with the numerous police officers that Borat interacts with). It also includes a report on the Borat incident at a rodeo and a few other things that neither add to or take away from the film.<br /><br />If you're familiar with Borat already and enjoy his antics, consider this a strong rental.  If you're easily offended, don't bother.  Overall, "Borat" is a funny film that has equal parts hilarity and unfunny idiocy in it.  Even though I'm a fan of the TV series, I have no plans on purchasing this DVD.  Rent it before you buy it, folks.</p></body></html>

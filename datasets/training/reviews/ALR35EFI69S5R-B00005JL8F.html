What was Ben Affleck thinking when he signed on to star in the functional equivalent of  `Young Indiana Jones' to a role that has Harrison Ford's hefty paw-prints all over it? Even if the film were a faithful recreation of Tom Clancy's superb and thought-provoking thriller about what happens when an Arab extremist group gains possession of an Israeli nuclear weapon lost during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, which it is not, the ploy of giving Jack Ryan the time machine treatment is hokey at best, and ruinous at worst. Luckily, the script is so hackneyed and implausible at parts that it was downright silly. <p>For example, Ryan is taking a helicopter ride when an atomic detonation occurs. The several kiloton blast knocks the chopper out of the sky, but Ryan survives. Right. The blast would have melted the chopper as it knocked it from the sky with a heat blast so intense nothing could have possibly survived.  But Hollywood can't kill off the Ryan franchise by pulling a Terminator-like turn and sending Ryan back into the past to get killed since that would prevent our boy Ben wouldn't mature into becoming Alex Baldwin, who then proceeds to save the free world in "The Hunt For Red October", set later in Ryan's career.  Got it? Me neither.  <p>Having said all that, had the main character's name not been Jack Ryan, and had I not already read the book and therefore arrived predisposed as to what it was that I was going to see dramatized, the film is not all that bad. As a techno-thriller, it is exciting, well photographed, and has a decent cast, including a charming Morgan Freeman (does this guy never take a vacation?) as Jack's Director of Counter Intelligence (DCI) connection. Lee Garlington is fetching and attractive as Jack's main squeeze, and Live Schreiber is particularly good as a young John Clark, a figure prominent in some of the later Clancy novels. The film is facts paced, has some interesting action sequences, and as an evening's entertainment is worth the watching. It is hardly in the caliber of films such as "The Hunt For Red October", "Patriot Games", or "Clear And Present Danger", but maybe Ben can try again when his paws grow a little with age. Ford is getting a little long in the tooth to be playing Ryan. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

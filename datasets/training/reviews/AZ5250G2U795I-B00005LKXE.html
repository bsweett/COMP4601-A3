I loved Hannibal...and had several friends who hated it, because they expected a true SOTL sequel.  If you understand that Hannibal is from the viewpoint of Lector, and the imagry is lush and refined, much like Hannibal would demand.  If you think you are getting a by the book sequel, you will be dissapointed.  If you think you are getting a look into the mind of one of the most intriquing characters created in the 20th century, you will NOT be dissapointed.</p></body></html>

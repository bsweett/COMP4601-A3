<meta name="summary" content="An Awesome Remake!!!"></head><body><p>I thought this was a very decent remake of the classic 1972 original. It has a lot of action and is very suspenseful. On New Year's Eve, a luxury cruise ship named after the Greek sea-god, Poseidon collides into a 150-foot tall rogue wave. After the ship is turned upside down, a small group of people try to make it to the surface alive. I highly recommend POSEIDON!!!</p></body></html>

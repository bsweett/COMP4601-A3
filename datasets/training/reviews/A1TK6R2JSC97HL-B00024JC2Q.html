<meta name="summary" content="Fun"></head><body><p>The march of the Seventies continues with this latest attempt to update an otherwise dramatic period show as an outright comedy. Stiller plays Starsky, the man with the natural perm, while Owen Wilson is the sensitive Hutch.  And the car is back (though it seems like they crunched about a dozen or so Gran Torino's in making this movie).  Set in the fictional "Bay City" (though it still looks as much LA as any of those cop shows supposedly set in NYC), "Starsky & Hutch" has our heroes working together for the first time to take down a crime lord (Vince Vaughn) set to flood the city with a new form of cocaine utterly undetectable by police dogs.  Will they be forced to rely on a local "businessman" named "Huggy Bear" (Snoop Dogg)?  You bet!  Will they earn the wrath of their Captain (Fred Williamson)?  You got it!  Will they be torn apart, yet rise above it and learn to work as a team?  No problem.  S&H is good clean fun - aside from a knife-throwing kid, a three-way kissing match between Hutch & 2 cheerleaders, a near case of "Russian Roulette" and a disco-dance challenge that goes bad.  The jokes are fun, but it's a thin movie - sort of like a stretched version of the "Sabotage" video done nearly a decade ago, in which all the hazards and professional hurdles of being an LAPD detective were compressed into a few minutes.  None of the jokes are that new - and most of them are sight gags (the ridiculous size of electronics, old cars and hair-dos, and how the cool people of the time look incredibly stupid and unattractive).  Though it hails from the same TV era as "Charlie's Angels" it's not quite as energized as either of the two "Angels" movies, could have used some more car-chases, but it's still a load of fun.</p></body></html>

The movie begins where Volume 1 left off: The Bride, now revealed as Beatrix Kiddo, played by Thurman, has just killed two of her former co-members in the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad: Vernita Green, played by Vivica A. Fox, and O-Ren Ishii, played by Lucy Liu. Now, Beatrix is determined to get to the leader of them all and once she does she will kill Bill, played by Caradine, but not before she confronts the one-eyed maniac Elle Driver, played by Hannah, in the most memorable fight scene of all Kill Bill films, and Bud, played by Madsen, Bill's trailer dwelling brother. Along the way, we are finally introduced to Bill (in the first Volume, Bill is heard but not seen). We're also given Bill's motives for ordering the assault on the Texas church where The Bride, her fiance and companions were brutally massacred by the DiVAS. The sequel also explores how Kiddo, or The Bride, was trained into becoming a killing machine, and, finally, introduces us to the fate of The Bride's baby and who the father is.<br /><br />Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2 have been hailed by many critics as Quentin Tarantino's best work since 1994's Oscar winning Pulp Fiction. As one whole movie, Kill Bill is undeniably his bloodiest film to date, and one of the most brilliant films of the first decade of the millennium.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A</p></body></html>

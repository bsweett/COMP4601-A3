<meta name="summary" content="THE SOUND OF MUSIC is more disturbing"></head><body><p>A young man (Jared Leto) gradually becomes an addict, meanwhile his mother (Ellen Burstyn) is becoming addicted to fad diets and diet pills. In addition to this she is watching too much TV and as a result is slowly losing the plot and gradually lapsing into her own bizzare world. But her son is too consumed with his own growing addiction and the lucrative profits to be made by dealing coke with his friends to notice her decline.<br />The movie is interesting in fits and spurts, but it soon turns into an all-out sensoral assault with not much of a point to it. I don't understand how this is on some lists of "Most Disturbing Movies". REQUIEM FOR A DREAM didn't disturb me at all. THE SOUND OF MUSIC, now THERE'S a movie that scarred me for life.<br />However, Darren Aronofsky has crafted a movie which is visually stunning, and puts the old split screen technique to creative use. The soundtrack is strange, to say the least; and features a bizzare combo of strings, techo and distortion.  The cast is good and also includes Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayons. But if you're expecting something "disturbing" you'll be disappointed.</p></body></html>

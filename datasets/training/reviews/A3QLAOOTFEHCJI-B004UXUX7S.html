<meta name="summary" content="Another brilliant film from Alexander Payne and masterful perfomance from George Clooney"></head><body><p>Based on the trailers, you would expect this film is mostly a comedy.  After all, it takes place in Hawaii and it stars George Clooney who we see in the trailer running with a funny gate and determined but weird look on his face.  Yes, this scene is in the movie but this isn't a comedy.  It's about a death...and life.<br /><br />Matt (Clooney) is a wealthy attorney but his real nest egg rests with some large acreage than he and a bevy of cousins have inherited from their families that have roots with a native Hawaiian princess.  The land is pristine and undeveloped.  Although jointly owned, Matt is the sole trustee therefore can decide on what happens with the land.  A plan is in place to sell the land to developers which would provide each of the owners a huge fortune.<br /><br />This really isn't the main story however, important as it is to the outcome.  Matt's wife is in a non-reversible coma and on life support after a boating accident. She will soon die.  They have 2 daughters, one 17 and another 11.  He's never been overly involved in their upbringing as this was the mother's role.  To complicate matters, Matt finds out that his wife had other outside interests besides boating.<br /><br />Alexander Payne ("Sideways") doesn't make a lot of movies but they always resonate.  This one is no exception.  He and his co-writers have put together a strong drama that is never heavy-handed or depressing.  This takes a deft hand at the helm and Payne provides it along with a stellar performance by Clooney and a cast of newcomers (Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller as the daughters) and veterans (Beau Bridges, Judy Greer, Robert Forster and Matthew Lillard).<br /><br />Blu ray update:  I still love the story and the way director Alexander Payne manages to get great performances from virtually every person on the set.  From surfing legend Laird Hamilton to George Clooney in what must be considered the finest of his career.  One thing the Blu ray allows you to do is study the actors in a closer more personal way as they inhabit their characters.  Clooney's character Matt King runs the gamete of emotions as he tries to deal with multiple catastrophes including the loss of his wife.<br />The other standout performance is by Shailene Woodley as Matt's oldest daughter Alex.  She goes from a wild partying 17 year old to a mature take charge older sister.  The younger sister Scottie is played by Amara Miller and frankly I didn't pay much attention to her the first time I saw the film.  I was so absorbed with everything else.  But watch this young actress steal scenes and add a bit of needed humor at the appropriate moment.<br /><br />Even small roles are played for all they're worth.  Robert Forster is the dickish father-in-law of Matt.  But Matt gives him an opportunity to grieve in his own way.  Watch the tender scene in the hospital as Forster's character says goodbye to his daughter.  Check out Judy Greer as the aggrieved spouse of her husband's infidelity.  The husband played by Matthew Lillard is likewise remarkable.  Far removed from Scooby-Doo. Beau Bridges has a couple brief scenes as Matt's cousin, but he takes full advantage.  Finally, you have to give it up for Patricia Hastie in an unappreciated and probably agonizing role as the comatose Elizabeth.  "The Descendants" is one of the finest films from 2011.<br /><br />The Blu ray shows a perfectly presented video in 1080p.  The colorful Hawaiian landscape shows up well with sharp focused detail.  It has a very film-like quality which is appropriate.  The aspect ratio is 2.40:1.  The audio is DTS-HD MA 5.1 and while not spectacular it is not distracting either.  This is a dialog centered film and it is clear and centered.  The guitar and ukulele plays in many scenes and they sound great.  Well done.</p></body></html>

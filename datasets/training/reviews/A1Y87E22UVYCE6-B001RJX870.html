<meta name="summary" content="Death Rattling of a Tyrant!"></head><body><p>"The Downfall" (2004) is a gripping description of Hitler's last days, done now by a German film director: Oliver Hirschbiegel.<br /><br /> This film was deservedly nominated to the Best Foreign Film Oscar 2005 and won many other international awards as Mar del Plata Best Screenplay, Bavarian Film Award for Best Actor and Best Production.<br /><br />The movie has many outstanding points.<br /><br />It is historically very accurate. All characters are shown with their tics and mannerisms, even if they appear very briefly. Such are the cases of Himmler and G&ouml;ring.<br /><br />Hitler, Goebbels, Eva Braun, Magda Goebbels, Speer and many more are described in depth. Each actor and actress performs at a superlative degree. They are able to infuse their personages with all the hysteria, depression and raw madness that were the "constitutional atmosphere" of the crowded Bunker without falling into stereotypes or caricatures.<br /><br />All these dreadful historical people are shown as what they were: just human beings. Hideous or righteous, arrogant or feeble, selfish or altruist, loyal or treacherous, whatever their attributes were, they are displayed with a sort of "inner truth" that make this film a shocking experience.<br /><br />In a very compact team we may point out Bruno Ganz, Ulrich Matthes and Julianne K&ouml;hler as the best performers.<br /><br />Battle scenes are very realistic even with limited resources (if compared with USA production budgets). Berlin reconstruction is superb.<br /><br />It is a shocking movie. I wasn't able to write this review before seeing it again.<br /><br />This is a highly recommended film for history aficionados, WWII films lovers and general public.<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

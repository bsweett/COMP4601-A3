<meta name="summary" content="Wild Wild West"></head><body><p>Another real doozy of film from 2007.  I love PT Anderson and this is another winner from him.  It plays like one of those major melodramas from the earlier years and does not fail to pull you in in with its theatrics.  Day-Lewis deserved his second Oscar for sure and damn if Paul Dano is not the exact opposit of his Little Miss Sunshine trip.  It keeps spilling over the brim, but it's sure worthwhile.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A bit more action violence than needed, but compelling"></head><body><p>The action scenes in this film go on for quite some time and are rather frequent. However, one can't help but feel sympathy for both the unfortunate aliens and for the hapless human who gets caught up in matters he never thought he would be involved in.  One can detect many implications and ideas here, from racism and xenophobia to the problems of refugees, to the status that would be given to aliens who are stuck here, to the morality of using them for medical experiments, and much more.  You don't need to be a sci fi fan to understand the deeper meanings of what the filmmakers are getting across.  They also have done a fantastic job with the aliens--their look, their movements, and even their expressions.<br /><br />It's also telling that they set the movie in Johannesburg, South Africa--I don't need to explain why.  Definitely worth a look and may be worth further discussion even in a classroom setting.</p></body></html>

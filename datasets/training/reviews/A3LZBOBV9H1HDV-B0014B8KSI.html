<meta name="summary" content=""Michael Clayton" is brilliant!"></head><body><p>"Michael Clayton" is brilliant! The cast led by George Clooney (in another Oscar-worthy performance as Michael Clayton) and Tom Wilkinson (terrific as Arthur Edens) is excellent! The story and screenplay and directing by Tony Gilroy (in his directorial debut), (he also wrote the screenplays to the "Bourne" movies) is excellent! The music by James Newton Howard (who also did the music to "The Lookout" (2007) and the upcoming "I Am Legend" (2007), "The Happening" (2008), & "The Dark Knight" (2008) is excellent! The cinematography by Robert Elswit (who also did the cinematography to "Syriana" (2005), which featured Clooney's Oscar-winning performance, and "Good Night, And Good Luck." (2005), which featured Clooney's Oscar-nominated directing) is excellent! The film editing by John Gilroy (who also did the film editing to "Miracle" (2004) and is Gilroy's younger brother) is excellent! The casting by Ellen Chenoweth (who also did the casting to "Good Night, And Good Luck.", "Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind" (2002), the upcoming "Leatherheads" (2008), (Clooney also starred and directed), "Intolerable Cruelty" (2003), "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" (2000), and the upcoming "No Country For Old Men" (2007) is excellent! The production design by Kevin Thompson (who also did the production design to "Stranger Than Fiction" (2006) is excellent! The art direction by Clay Brown is excellent! The set decoration by Paul Cheponis (who is also an assistant art director to the upcoming "American Gangster" (2007), George DeTitta Jr. (who also did the set decoration to the upcoming "I Am Legend" and "The Lovely Bones" (2008), Chuck Potter (who is also an assistant set decoration to the upcoming "I Am Legend") is excellent! The costume design by Sarah Edwards (who also did the costume design to "The Interpreter" (2005) is excellent! This is a well-made thriller that is different than anything out there. This is one of the best films of the year, so far. Clooney, Wilkinson, and Tony Gilroy are sure to be remembered when Oscar nominations roll around.</p></body></html>

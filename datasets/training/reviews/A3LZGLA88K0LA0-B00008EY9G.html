Take your stock ten characters, place them in a motel (hmm???), an awful storm and then before you know, one by one....yes, they're picked off.  But note some of the eerie clues director Mangold posits:  why does the room number on room 6 becoming 9 important: what's that on Ray Liotta's shirt?  What are the scenes with Alfred Molina all about; nothing is as it seems in this movie and that's what makes it so much fun.  John Cusack is brilliant in his role as the cop turned chauffeur; Rebecca De Mornay does for this role what Janet Leigh did for &quot;Psycho&quot; and Angie Dickinson for &quot;Dressed to Kill.&quot;  Ray Liotta is also effective in his law enforcing role; Amanda Peet is both beautiful and impressive as the hooker going to start her own lime/orange farm.  Little Bret Roehr as Timmy is also eerily effective.  Only John McGinley who takes George a little over the top seems out of place and that's not a drawback, just one of those little petty things we have to complain about?<br />I loved the feel of this movie; the rain, the general &quot;staginess&quot; of the motel itself; De Mornay's love affair with her cell phone.<br />This is a great movie and in time think it will join those underappreciated classic mysteries of our time.<br />ENJOY!</p></body></html>

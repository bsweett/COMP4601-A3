<meta name="summary" content="During The Apocalypse ..."></head><body><p>A lot of people automatically credit this movie with inventing the fast moving, overpowering zombie. Undoubtedly, the images presented by Danny Boyle of his Rage-infested, ticking time bombs are chaotic and very troubling to watch. Most see this and think in the back of their minds that `when this goes down -- they won't have a chance'. I feel the same way. Seemingly guns, bullets and shelter don't help in any case. The best bet looks like a underground bunker, but good luck on finding one.<br /><br />For the record, John Carpenter's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CY6P">Ghosts of Mars</a> in 2001 brought out the maniacal and unstoppable undead to the screen for the very first time. While `Ghost of Mars' is a very dark and also very troubling film, due to its spiritual angle, it's very forgettable. I was put into a very uneasy state when I saw it in the theatre, but I was forever put into a state of alert after seeing 28 Days Later.<br /><br />The use of a digital camera, hand-held throughout, was cutting edge when Danny Boyle did it for the first time, now Paul Greengrass seems to have made a career of copying his techniques. Note to the theatre going film elite: Greengrass may be good at what he does, but just remember what he did before the release of 28 Days Later is completely forgettable.<br /><br />28 Days Later is hands down the best Zombie movie ever made. The realism  is frightening and dark. The high water mark may be so high in this that others trying to emulate it may only get within groveling distance.<br /><br />Some may have seen this and thought: "hey that'll never happen. It's fiction." Yeah? Think so? Just watch the attached documentary in the special features and you might be scratching your head and looking for the gas cans. Maybe we won't have to fight  off zombies, but being wiped out by plague is a highly possible and very probable future scenario.<br /><br />See you in the next life ...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ain't marriage grand?"></head><body><p>Despite being a fun and sexy romp, Mr. and Mrs. Smith will probably go down in history as the film that made Brad Pitt go from Jennifer Aniston to Angelina Jolie. Like a lot of films, the press behind it seemed to interest more people than the actual film itself, although it did a good number at the box office. While it's a bit problematic, this film wasn't designed to get your kleenex going or your mind working; it just wants to have fun and fun it has. This is the unrated edition so there's more stuff put in (or in some cases, taken out) but by and large, it's still the same rollickingly fun movie.<br /><br />While in Columbia, John and Jane meet and soon a relationship blossoms and they get married. But despite being insanely attractive, they don't really get along but seeing as how they're both hired assassins for separate agencies with none the wiser about the other's "real" profession, it's a good thing. But soon they find out and want to kill each other until there's a hit put out on the 2 of them so they have to team up and survive together and maybe even fall in love, and for real this time.<br /><br />Whether the meeting of the co-stars did result in the breakup of a marriage, you have to admit these 2 have huge time chemistry on-screen; so much so that the idea that their sex life is on the fritz seems almost laughable. It's also good that their acting is up to snuff and while they don't feel like completely realized characters, they more than pull it off. There's also some roles by always likable Adam Brody and scene-stealer Vince Vaughn.<br /><br />The action scenes are the highlight although they're none too inventive (although, the use of the dual sliding doors on SUV's was funny) but that's what we came to see: people getting shot at in MTV-style moves. My one complaint is that certain plot elements seem dropped, like the writer didn't want to write TOO much for the movie so he just wrote the bare minimum, even if certain things don't even get explained. But then again, this is a movie meant to be a blockbuster "good times had by all" kind of movie so it's kind of hard to complain when that was the point, no?<br /><br />It might not be the best action movie of that year or any year but if you ever pick it up, you might just enjoy yourself which is the whole point.</p></body></html>

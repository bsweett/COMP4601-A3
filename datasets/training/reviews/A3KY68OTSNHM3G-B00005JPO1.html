<meta name="summary" content="Indy's Back"></head><body><p>After a 15-year hiatus, Harrison Ford has reprised his best role as the swash-buckling, fedora-wearing archaeologist/university professor Indiana Jones.  This time, Indy's up against Russian agents led by a sword wielding female commander, played by Cate Blanchett.  The two groups are in pursuit of a crystal skull, which has powers related to a mythical city of gold.<br /><br />Indy, along with his partner Mac, were captured by the Russians in Mexico.  Upon returning to the U.S., Indy and the Russians head to Roswell, New Mexico, site of the infamous "Area 51", which is loaded with secrets.  Indy is forced to locate a box containing the mummified remains of an extra-terrestrial who crashed in the desert.  But, Indy has a surprise in store.  After managing to escape from the Russians, Indy wanders into a specially-constructed city with mannequins designed to measure the effects of an atomic blast.  Indy manages to save himself by hiding inside a lead-protected refrigerator.  But, the adventure's just beginning.<br /><br />Indy is then convinced to head to Peru at the behest of Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf).  Mutt's friend Professor Oxley, played by John Hurt, has been captured because he knows the location of the crystal skull. Oxley is also a colleague of Indy's.  It is said that whoever finds the skull and returns it to its rightful place will gain knowledge beyond their wildest dreams.  But, the Russians are on to the skull as well, and its a race between them and Indy to find the skull first.  Along the way, Marion Ravenwood, Indy's original love interest from "Raiders of the Lost Ark" returns, played once again by Karen Allen.  Marion holds a revealing secret that surprises Indy.  Marion has softened somewhat over the years, but she still holds a spell over Indy.<br /><br />Harrison Ford is once again at his swashbuckling best as Professor Jones.  Indy has become Ford's signature role over they years; even above his role of Han Solo in the first "Star Wars" trilogy.  Karen Allen is very good as the gutsy but softer Marion, and Shia LaBeouf does a surprisingly good job as Mutt.  There is lots of great action scenes throughout: I especially liked the scenes with the giant ants, and, of course, there's some great comedy from Indy, too.  This film might not stack up to the first three movies in the series, but it is still very good and definitely worth watching.<br /><br />I highly recommend this action-packed movie.  Its a must-see for Harrison Ford fans and fans of the first three Indiana Jones movies.</p></body></html>

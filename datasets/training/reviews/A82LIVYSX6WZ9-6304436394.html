<meta name="summary" content="blazing action with a little bit of love"></head><body><p>the movies highlight and best scene is the gun blazing, action filled shootout in the bar and Banderas just slides his guns out from under his sleeves as the man opens his guitar case and finds the guns and just opens a can of whoop ass on the guys. Quentin Tarintino, Steve Buscemi, Salma Hayek, Danny Trejo and Cheech Marin join Banderas in this totally great action flick from Rodriguez, oh and theres a love scene involving Hayeks haha's</p></body></html>

The Scariest Movie Ever....."></head><body><p>Being a huge horror movie fan, I've seen hundreds of horror movies but not one of them, besides this movie, ever made me say " I will never watch this movie again!!". I give this movie 5 stars only because no other movie has ever come close to the horror The Exorcist portrays. I've seen other "possession" movies but none hold a candle to the horror of this film. I must admit that for a 1973 film, the special effects are outstanding. Linda Blair, as young as she was, actually did a wonderful job portraying Reagan, a young girl possessed by the devil. The beginning of the movie is quite boring until we see Reagan's bed start jumping all around. From that point on, we see her go through a battery of tests trying to figure out what is wrong with her. You really feel for her mother who has to witness the terrible things happening to her daughter. There are scenes from this movie that are forever sketched in my mind unfortunately! From her head spinning around, the awful devil voice she speaks in, the green eyes with the scariest face I've ever seen, spitting up pea soup in a priest's face, her levitating above her bed, her bedroom being so cold that "smoke" actually comes out of your mouth, her taunting of the priests, her throwing a priest out of her bedroom window, and the worst to me being the part where she is sitting there covering her mouth and laughing at it all. The exorcism ritual is awful to watch when the priest throws holy water on her and her flesh opens up. The language also in the film is horrific. With her speaking in different languages, it adds to the creepiness of the movie. Another awful memory is when she sits up in her bed and we see the devil behind her. Ewwwwwww.... I'm getting the creeps just writing about this. The only good thing about the movie is that the exorcism is sucessful and she has no memory of what happened to her yet she hugs a priest at the end of the movie when she and her mother leave the home. Of course there have been sequels and prequels to this movie but there will never be another movie that even comes close to scaring the "devil" out of you like this movie does. Definetly not a movie for children to watch. Talk about nightmares! For anyone who has not seen this classic horror movie, just beware!! It's not a movie for everyone and many people who have not seen this movie might be really effected.... like I was but.......never again!!!</p></body></html>

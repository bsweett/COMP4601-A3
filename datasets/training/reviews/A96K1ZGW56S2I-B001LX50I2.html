As interesting a character Hannibal Lector is, I really haven't enjoyed the Hannibal Lector movies that much.  This goes against the popular vein, but other than the acting and some interesting cinematographic effects, I wasn't impressed by SILENCE OF THE LAMBS; MANHUNTER (the original film based off of the novel Red Dragon) was a colorful piece of cinematic art quite creative in its use of lighting, sound, and color; and though I enjoyed HANNIBAL the most of Lector movies, it is very violent and unbelievable absurd.  Nevertheless, I was looking forward to watching RED DRAGON, the prequel to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and remake of Michael Mann's MANHUNTER. With Anthony Hopkins back as Dr. Hannibal Lector, the brilliant Edward Norton playing detective Will Graham, and the mysterious Ralph Fiennes as Francis Dolarhyde (aka "The Tooth Fairy") I thought the movie would be the best of them all.  I should be used to movie disappointments by now.<br /><br />The movie begins with prologue illustrating how Will Graham was able to successfully capture Dr. Hannibal Lector. The movie then fast forwards in time three years. A new serial killer is loose killing entire families one an evening when there is a full moon. Graham's former boss at the FBI asks him to come out retirement to help track the madman down.  After some internal conflict, soul searching, and weighing the risks Graham agrees. The case proves more difficult than anyone thought and even with the assistance of Dr. Lector, no major leads are discovered.  But the killer, "The Tooth Fairy", like the legendary Frankenstein's monster, ends up falling in love with a blind girl.  She is oblivious to his flaws.  Touched by grace, the killer falls deeper and deeper into a confusing downward spiral of self-loathing and bittered anger.<br /><br />On the surface, the movie is interesting and entertaing enough. The prologue at the beginning of the movie is brilliant and makes the movie watching solely for that. However, the deeper elements I was expected from the film just weren't there. Edward Norton is a great actor, but he's much too young to play Will Graham and just wasn't able to capture the internal epic struggle that Graham feels throughout.  Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as always. However, Ralph Fiennes' talent wasn't used as the role of Francis Dolarhyde seemed to be cut down to a cardboard caricature more than a real life flesh and blood character. Philip Seymour Hoffman (Freddy Lounds), Emily Watson (Reba McClane), and Harvey Keitel (Jack Crawford) did wonderful jobs in their supporting roles, but it isn't enough to counter-balance Norton's miscasting and Fiennes' lack of a meaty role.<br /><br />Also missing in this film were any elements that would lend it some credibility as a crime drama/thriller. I didn't enjoy MANHUNTER very much, but Michael Mann at least played around with light, color, and sound to produce an ode of moving art. RED DRAGON has none of that.  There aren't any outstanding images and the movie's score and soundtrack are seriously lacking. Besides the prologue at the beginning, the pacing of the movie also seems slow, almost too slow for a thriller such as RED DRAGON.  In fact, for all intense purposes, RED DRAGON is basically the same type of movie that Hollywood churns out all the time, only with a talented (but misused) cast and a very interesting prologue.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the series, RED DRAGON is worth watching. Other than that, the film really isn't a must see, but is fun to watch on a weekend if you have nothing better to see.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE HONESTY OF THE MUSIC SAYS IT ALL:  RAY CHARLES"></head><body><p>IN A NUTSHELL: GREAT MUSIC BY A MAN WHO LIVED [2-disk WS ed.]<br /><br />Jammie Foxx is absolutely convincing and possesses the essence of the man, Ray Charles, as much as is possible in a biopic. A great deal about "Ray" that we may have been unaware of is exposed on the screen, for better or worse. However, no matter what is happening is his life, Ray's music just keeps getting better and better and more widely heard and appreciated. He transcended barriers of all kinds which with the aid of his perserverance, and personality which was all made possible by his priceless musical gift.<br /><br />WHAT IT IS: FOR STARTERS: AS GOOD A MUSIC VIDEO AS THERE IS!<br /><br />The biopic about a very special human being who created terrificlly popular, though demonized by some, American music that the entire world came to appreciate. If this film is nothing else, it is a moving emotional music video of the great music. Hpwever, the film is much more than that. "Ray" is about the struggle of Ray Charles, from early childhood blindness to the difficulty of coping with the pressures of his ambition and his desires. He also had to deal with being blind and black, as well as the exploitation that this lent itself too. There was also the personal toll on himself, which was considerable and included some of his self-indulgences and his convictions too.<br /><br />All in all, "Ray" depicts that life was not easy for Ray Charles. Yet, he was able to have his music his own way, which of course was the root of his greatness. He had faults, but for the most part he confronted his demons, and kept himself from becoming a tragic figure. In the end, he was winner in every way, and his music will live on forever as will the example he set. He aimed high, and he reached that goal, and then he cleaned-up his act on a personal level, which is very much to his credit.<br /><br />----- THE ACTORS - THE PRODUCTION CREW - THE MAJOR AWARDS -<br /><br />----- THE ACTORS -<br /><br />-----*- Jamie Foxx  - Ray Charles<br />-----*- Kerry Washington  - Della Charles<br />-----*- Regina King  - Margie Hendrix<br />-----*- Clifton Powell  - Jeff Brown<br />-----*- Aunjanue Ellis  - Mary Ann Fisher<br />-----*- Harry J.

I can just say that every feature is worthwhile and very concise, but I found myself wishing for more, especially in the area of the life of Ray himself.<br /><br />-*- Available Subtitles: Spanish, French -*- Available Audio Tracks: English, French<br /><br />Commentary by: director Taylor Hackford<br /><br />Original theatrical version and extended version of film with 14 deleted scenes not shown in theaters [I preferred the extended version, but it is a little disjointed when it switches to deleted scenes]<br /><br />"Walking in his Shoes" Featurette [tells how Jamie Foxx auditioned for the role and had to play the piano blind and meet Ray of course, who did approve of Jamie]<br /><br />"Ray Remembered" Featurette [much too short - but well done]<br /><br />Theatrical Trailer<br /><br />9 additional complete and uncut musical performances [these are incredible music videos]<br /><br />"Soul Mates" featurette<br /><br />"A Filmmakers Journey"<br /><br />Academy Special - "The Women of Ray"<br /><br />"Ray: An American Story" Booklet -interesting but again not enough!<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: I WAS AFRAID "RAY" WOULD BE A TRAGIC FILM - IT WASN'T - IT WAS INSPIRATIONAL!<br /><br />The music video that "Ray" is steeped in alone, makes this film very well worth watching. But there's more, much more to "Ray", chiefly due to Jamie Foxx's inspired performance which lifted the entire cast, and thereby the film, to do it all better.</p></body></html>

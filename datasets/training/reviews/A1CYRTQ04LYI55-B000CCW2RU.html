<meta name="summary" content="5 star premise, 2 star execution"></head><body><p>Great premise - the Minority Report meets Soylent Green meets the Matrix with a heap of current ethical issues tossed in to boot.  Perhaps the execution failed because there were conflicting goals - was this a morality play or an action flick?  Either way, the premise was an interesting one.  You just keep wondering, "We get the joke, now when's it going to end?"  It's like hearing the punchline halfway through the set-up.  Could've easily been a 90 minute movie.</p></body></html>

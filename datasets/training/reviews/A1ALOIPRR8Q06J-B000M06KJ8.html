That's the impression you get of the infamous Marie "Let Them Eat Cake" Antoinette presented here. Kirsten Dunst, well cast as the queen, actually says she would never say "Let them eat cake" in this movie. There seems to me elements of truth to this but I took it all in very lightly while looking at beautiful and elaborate costumes, the Palace of Versailles, the wigs, the shoes, the food and pastries, all the while listening to that New Wave/"alternative" soundtrack. I think we're exploring the personal and subjective here more than the political and historical... And we are enjoying playing dress-up. I had a sense of what to expect before seeing it so I enjoyed the show. The film Coppola made wasn't one that many critics wanted and nor for that matter is it a portrayal of Marie Antoinette and the French court that I'd have been most interested in. But it is what it is and it's a good movie and the one the director wanted to make. You got to give some points for originality. Judged based on what seems to be what Sofia Coppola wanted to do here, it works.<br /><br />I look forward to more from Sofia Coppola. LOST IN TRANSLATION is a favorite. Her films are so moody and atmospheric, at times dreamlike, and I that's what I like most about them.<br /><br />Maybe check out "Ten things that occurred to me while watching MARIE ANTOINETTE" by Roger Ebert on his website for some nice insight and appreciation. Ebert is a great friend to the movies and I hope he's around for a long time to come. Also, The New Yorker's Anthony Lane's piece "Lost in the Revolution" is excellent. For a different reaction see "Sofia Coppola's MARIE ANTOINETTE: Not even cake?" by Emanuele Saccarelli on World Socialist Web Site. Lol.</p></body></html>

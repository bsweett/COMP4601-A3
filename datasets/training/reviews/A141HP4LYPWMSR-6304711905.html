When you compare the two it doesn't take long to see the similarities between these classic films and realize what sets them apart from the rest of the pack.<br /><br />1) Both films boast superior casts and many unforgetable performances.<br />2) The momentum starts to build from the very begining and never faulters on its journey to the closing credits.<br />3) The dialogue is amazing. Every word, every phrase is loaded with meaning and portent, all coupled with a plethora of quotable lines you'll never tire of hearing viewing after viewing.<br /><br />Probably the most important similarity of all is they both exude an aura of nobility about the characters involved, perfectly capturing what you might like to call the "noble savage". If you want to know what constitutes a classic western study these two films. You'll figure it out in no time.<br /><br />Wonderful performances abound; Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Powers Boothe, Billy Zane, the list goes on and on. However it's Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holliday that will forever remain my favorite.<br /><br />'Tombstone' receives my highest rating: 5 Stars!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kung Fu meets the Road Runner meets The Matrix"></head><body><p>This is one fun and strange flick.  I think it is best described as Kung Fu meets the Road Runner and The Matrix.  It has some wonderful visual effects, a fun story that keeps you guessing, and some downright silly fun along with a kind of violence that is so stylized that you don't really get all that upset.<br /><br />One example of a great visual is when one of our heroes is walking down a dark alley and we see a cat up on a wall.  As he walks by we see the cat jump out of frame, but if you watch its shadow on the wall you see it fall into two halves (and understand what that means) as a flying sword comes into frame.<br /><br />So much is not what it seems in this movie with so many inversions of roles that I found myself just sitting back and wondering what could be thrown at me next.<br /><br />Now, the movie is in Chinese with English subtitles.  I don't mind them at all.  But if you speak Chinese you won't need them.  But if you don't understand Chinese and hate subtitles you will be cheated if you miss this movie because of them.  Really, after a few minutes, you simply won't care.</p></body></html>

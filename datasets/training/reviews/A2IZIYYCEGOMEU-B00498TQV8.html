<meta name="summary" content="INTENSE, AND NOT EASILY FORGOTTEN"></head><body><p>This is hardcore storytelling with jolting characterizations, and Oscar-worthy performances. WINTER'S BONE is one of the finest pieces of American cinema I have seen in many a year, and not because it's uplifting, or full of soft-and-fuzzy sacharine. On the contrary, depression is a way of life in the stark, crank-infested Ozarks, and the hand that's been dealt to young Ree Dolly ( a truly magnificent Jennifer Lawrence ) is far from good. The straight-forward intensity of this incredible film may be to much for some.</p></body></html>

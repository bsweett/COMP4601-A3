<meta name="summary" content="Mission: Familiar"></head><body><p>It's a mark of how wildly over budget Mission: Impossible 2 went and how generous its star's deal was that despite an impressive-on-paper gross of $550m Paramount constantly cancelled a third entry as unprofitable, even paying off cast and writing off South African second-unit work already in the can until the budget was halved and Tom Cruise agreed to substantially reduce his percentage of the take - by which time original director Joe Carnahan had already walked out over that old favourite, `creative differences,' and an entirely new story come up with. Hardly the most promising of omens for a franchise that always seemed little more than an excuse for its star to play James Bond. Yet despite the bad track record for Hollywood threequels, Mission: Impossible III is a massive improvement over the incredibly awful second entry in the series, and its likely that its much lower box-office may have been as much down to moviegoers disappointment with John Woo's dreary dud and the six year gap between films as Cruise's well-publicised mental meltdown on the promotional tour.<br /><br />Cruise has certainly always treated the films as an ego trip, throwing out the teamwork aspect of the TV show and even turning Jim Phelps into a villain to allow for more solo grandstanding, but this time round director J.J. Abrams at least ensures that there are fewer slo-mo hairspray ad close-ups of Cruise and that the team have more to do than just get killed even if the plotting is predictable every step of the way: you know exactly which characters will die at which point in the film and who'll turn out to be on who's side within the first five minutes. In fact, it's almost a remix of the first film - failed mission, dead agent, Ethan Hunt suspected by shifty boss, has to steal Macguffin for the baddies to prove innocence, yadda yadda. With no surprises on offer, the onus is on the action and the execution, with variable results. The tired handheld camerawork in the pretitle sequence just seems pass&eacute; rather than edgy while the first big rescue boasts a lot of noise, hardware and motion but less excitement than it should, as does a very expensive bridge sequence involving rocket drones, helicopters and exploding vehicles, but there's a nifty kidnapping at the Vatican that is a welcome throwback to the kind of ingenious caper the old show's reputation was built on rather than the Bond-wannabe shoot `em ups that Cruise seems to prefer. Yet at times the film seems keener on imitating True Lies than the old Mission: Impossible, with Cruise pretending to be a boring traffic consultant to new wife and friends until he has to rescue her from a fiendish arms trafficker. Even some of the locations (especially that bridge) look like they still have Arnie's fingerprints on them.<br /><br />Still, although costing a lot less than the second film, it looks a lot more lavish even if it never quite kicks into high gear and ends with an even dafter defibrillator scene than Casino Royale (though the biggest unintentional laugh comes from a villain's claim that cleaning up and rebuilding the infrastructure after the kind of Middle Eastern war he intends to provoke is what America does best: right...). Aside from Ving Rhames and Michelle Monaghan, none of the cast get much of a chance to make an impression. Maggie Q has even less to do than Michelle Yeoh in Tomorrow Never Dies, with her one real fight scene relegated to the deleted scenes bin, while a dire Billy Crudup is memorable only for being so spectacularly obvious as Cruise's immediate boss. Philip Seymour Hoffman is less irritatingly mannered than usual, and if still not an especially menacing villain, his casting does at least offer an amusing opportunity to see the considerably shorter Cruise somehow grow several inches to imitate him in one scene. The eternally unimaginative Michael Giacchino does his usual more-or-less competent bit of plagiarism routine with the score, getting away with reorchestrating other composers' familiar themes from his record collection (and not just his less-than-dazzling big band orchestration of Lalo Schifrin's theme) rather than creating anything vaguely original, but he's hardly alone in that in this film. For all the early hype about giving the series an edge, this is about delivering something that stays within the audience and studio's comfort zone and sticks with what they know works - in other words, a professionally delivered Summer movie that makes no demands as it repackages familiar ingredients as new-and-improved but also doesn't leave you feeling you've been completely ripped off by the end.<br /><br />If the film itself is less of a Cruise ego-stroke than usual for his Paramount films, the DVD special features on the two-disc set more than make up for it, filled with gushing tributes to Cruise's genius, excellence, humanity, consideration, modesty and, presumably, his ability to heal the sick, feed the multitudes, walk on water and raise the dead (some of them are just too gushing in their worship of his greatness to watch in their entirety). On the plus side it also includes deleted scenes, TV spots and various trailers, though they're mostly slight variations of the same basic format.</p></body></html>

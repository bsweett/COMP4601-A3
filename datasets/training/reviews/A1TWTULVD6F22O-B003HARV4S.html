<meta name="summary" content="Fine films find a better director."></head><body><p>All rightie.<br /><br />We're going to have two films about magicians this year.  Check.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" stars Edward Norton and Rufus Sewell, "The Prestige" stars Hugh Jackman and Christopher Bale.  Advantage, "The Prestige".....although Norton is usually hard to beat.<br /><br />Character is contributed by Paul Giamatti in "The Illusionist", and Michael Caine in "The Prestige".  Advantage, "The Illusionist".  Rationale?  Giamatti may be the best character actor in the business today, despite Caine's long and dignified track record.<br /><br />Eye Candy.  "The Illusionist"...Jessica Biel, this year's "It" girl.  "The Prestige" has Scarlett Johansson, the "It" girl from two years ago.  Hmmm...a draw?  Not really. Johansson is a truly gifted actress, with real acting chops. Advantage, "The Prestige".<br /><br />Script source?  "The Illusionist"....a fine short story.  "The Prestige"....a book, but screenplay is by the impeccable Chris Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins)....advantage, "The Prestige."<br /><br />Director?  "The Illusionist"; Neil Burger.  Who? Who?<br /><br />"The Prestige"....Chris Nolan.  Big advantage, "The Prestige".<br /><br />I haven't seen "The Prestige" yet, and this review is about "The Illusionist".  The "Illusionist" is an enjoyable film that could have been so much more in the hands of a different director.  Beautifully acted, costumes and cinematography are brilliant.  Vienna on film is foreboding (despite the fact that it was really Prague).  The sound is horrible, and the sepia tone (to brand this a period piece) was overstated.  Virtually none of the film is constructed by action, it is all dialogue.  Definitely, these are all marks of a first-time director.  And Rufus Sewell's mustache is atrocious (I did love his hall of animal racks, however...it was truly ludicrous).  I was drawn to the film and taken in by the plot and what might have been for this film.  Despite the slow pacing, (and a remarkable lack of chemistry between Biel and Norton)it managed to overcome most of the deficiencies.  Giamatti is impeccable here, now brisk, brittle and corrupt, now completely open to the magic, with a physical need to know just how the tricks are produced.  He's compiling a treasure chest of work on film.<br /><br />Would I see it again?  Yes, on DVD.  Would I recommend it to others? ...Yes, I suppose.  Was it memorable?...oh, yes.  Do I expect "The Prestige" to be better?...oh heck yeah.</p></body></html>

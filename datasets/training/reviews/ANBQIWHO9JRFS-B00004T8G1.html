Simply put, this movie is passable, and certainly not one of Carpenter's better efforts.  In their eternal rage over the recent popularity of the remake, some people like to imagine that whatever original is a classic.  This one isn't.  It wants to be atmospheric, but it's mostly just uneventful, and endless shots of fog banks aren't especially fascinating, and the bland characters yakking it up aren't terribly remarkable either.  The ghost-sailor-zombies are pretty neat, but they don't actually do all that much that we get to see.  I don't remember much of anything about the characters at this point, so they must not have been very fascinating, though I do recall being irritated by Jamie Lee Curtis, as per usual.  Again, this film is passably interesting, but Carpenter just can't quite generate enough  atmosphere to make up  for the fact that nothing is actually going on.  And though the fog looks pretty nice most of the time, the cinematography is generally pretty bland.  (There is one major exception in the form of an excellent shot of a number of ghosts standing in the church, but that's about it.)  And, the opening attack on the ship at the beginning is pretty well done, nicely transferring Carpenter's slasher skills to a new genre.  But, the film is a whole is just kinda blah.  Not quite boring, but far from engrossing, and it has a fairly anti-climactic ending.<br /><br />Frankly, this movie is a perfect candidate for  remake.  Good concept, passable execution.  Course, the remake is pretty lousy, but it didn't have to be.  If they'd hired some talented people to write and direct it, it probably coulda been pretty good.  Though I find it utterly hilarious that people are whining about how this  material will 'watered down' for the remake. Hah!  This movie isn't gory at all, as in it doesn't have ANY gore in it.  We see a few blades and hooks poke at a shirt.  That's about it.  The remake is actually substantially more graphic than the original, and there is no way in hell that this version would be rated R is it had been released this year. (Well, I won't go quite that far.  The MPAA might give anything any rating at any time, but they'd have to be far more confused than usual to place an R on this again.)  Apparently some people failed to notice that modern rating standards are a helluva lot more lax than they used to be.  Hell, 'The Fog' was less graphic than some PG movies even at the time.  'Jaws', for example, is far more graphic than this, and that came out like 7 years before this.  I think they use the, ahem, f-word like once in this movie, which may well be the real reason for the R.<br /><br />Most people are gonna tell you, 'Don't see that crappy remake, see this amazing, innovative original!!!'  Well, I dunno if you really need to see either of them, particularly if you're not a huge horror fan.  Just go watch 'The Thing' again, or perhaps check out Carpenter's underappreciated 'In the Mouth of Madness'.  If you're a non-discriminating horror junkie like me, you might as well see them both.  It's actually a kinda interesting case study, as the original is a too low-key, whereas the remake is way overdone, particularly at the end. (Where it becomes quite comically over the top.)  Though, you definitely shouldn't see the remake until you've seen the original.  It just isn't proper, and it is the better of the two, if not by all that much..  But yeah, whatever, I've already talked about these films more than they deserve.<br /><br />Grade: C</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Predator!"></head><body><p>Before Die Hard, John McTiernan helmed this action plus gore fest starring Ah-Nold Schwarzenegger as Major Alan 'Dutch' Schaefer, on a mission with a bunch of hulky army guys to kill an invisible alien. One of the big man's best films, with great action, a creepy musical score and Stan Winston's excellent alien. However it still succumbs to the formulaic "kill everyone but the main guy" ending. And plausibility as well as subtlety are nowhere to be seen. But who cares? The action ante is great, and McTiernan's talent for over-the top action can be seen very clearly here. This is great brainless entertainment. The DVD is a real letdown though, with only a trailer. Boo!</p></body></html>

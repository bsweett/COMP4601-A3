Nice to see him getting a little long in the tooth as well, which helps lend depth to his character.  In its opening scenes, this promises to be a transcendant Bond film, taking an entirely different tone from those that came before: this time around, 007 gets caught on a mission and, astoundingly, spends over a year in a brutal torture camp hidden somewhere deep in North Korea.  When he's traded back to the West in exchange for one of the baddies who did him in, James finds himself unwelcome at MI5 -- for unexplained reasons, they seem to think he had something to do with his own capture and the failure of the mission.  Relieved of duty, Bond briefly becomes a rogue agent, driven by revenge and perhaps just a little bitterness towards jolly olde England.  It's a nice set-up, but quickly devolves into a typical flurry of car chases, big explosions, glib dialogue and improbable, campy plot twists, along with every new extreme sport known to man.  A fine Bond film, but not the radically new approach hinted at in the beginning.  Can't say I was wild about Halle Berry as the latest Bond girl, Jinx, but overall the movie was good, clean fun.</p></body></html>

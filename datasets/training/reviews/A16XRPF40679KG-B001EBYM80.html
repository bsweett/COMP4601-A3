<meta name="summary" content="decent sci fi drama, great blu ray"></head><body><p>The movie is a decent sci fi drama based in a prison ,and taking place in the past (1930's) where social inequality was a terrible fact. I don't say racial; because we are all one human race with different skin colors biologically speaking. The acting is good and it is a good steven king adaptation. NOt as powerful and truly great 'shawshank redemption' another steven king story that is a straight drama , but is set back in this era as well. The acting is first class with tom hanks and the rest of the cast doing a fine job. Michael Clarke Duncan is especially good as the giant with strange abilities. (HE died of cardiac arrest at age 54 in 2012, sadly). MOst people who are that tall don't live to be sixty which is unfortunate as well, anyway he really puts in a outstanding performance here.  The blu ray is a very good one and the regular one is the same blu ray as the book version, it's a better buy , unless you want the collectors aspect. There are some good extra features on here as well. So sell off your dvd and buy the blu ray version.</p></body></html>

This movie is black and white. Even if color had been available, black and white would still have worked better. The scenes, the closeups of people, they all have some some monumental quality, some kind of skill that's been lost for decades, now. The personalities also stand out in black and white - a resistance hero, a man without a country, a cheerfully venial functionary. Even the DC-3 in the last scene is the icon of a plane, F-15s and 747s not withstanding.<br /><br />No one can claim to be literate if they haven't seen this movie, no more than if they haven't heard Beethoven's Ninth. At the time, this movie was just one among many churned out assembly-line style. Something in it captivated people, though, and keeps captivating them today.<br /><br />Whether or not it's your first time, be captivated.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Film That Will Gain Respect In Time"></head><body><p>W. is a film not many people want to see or even discuss because of the subject matter - the career of the country's most unpopular President, the debacle of the Iraq War, and the decimated economy. There is a certain 'guilt' that comes with criticizing the leader of the country, from both conservatives and liberals: it is not polite to condemn our elected leaders.  But now with the Bush legacy daily being pushed into the past (though the after burn of that embarrassing 8 years will never completely go away), it is time for biographers to examine why the Bush version of Presidential autonomy occurred.<br /><br />Oliver Stone has examined Nixon and JFK on film and now with a terse script Stanley Weiser he summarizes the life of George W. Bush, from his early bad boy drinking years and inability to hold a job through his family collisions (brother Jeb being the obvious successor to George Bush, Sr.), to his bull headed drive toward absolute power to finish the war his father didn't finish - securing the Middle East oil fields to be held by American control by fabricating the infamous Axis of Evil and Weapons of Mass Destruction as drivers to light the preemptive blundering war against Saddam Hussein and Iraq.<br /><br />In lesser hands this film might have become too prejudiced a view of a president.  But Oliver Stone's technique of telling a story makes this film work: we see the rise and fall of a pitifully misguided man whose judgment and lack of intelligence brought us to where we are today.  Much of the success of the film is due to the casting of Josh Brolin as W., James Cromwell as Bush Sr., Ellen Burstyn as Barbara Bush, Richard Dreyfuss as the terrifying Dick Cheney, Jeffrey Wright as Colin Powell, Elizabeth Banks as Laura Bush, Scott Glenn as Donald Rumsfeld, Toby Jones as Karl Rove, Bruce McGill as George Tenet, and a puzzling performance by Thandie Newton as Condoleeza Rice.  Their characterizations are remarkable and give an insider's view as to the tehniques used to change a democracy into an oligarchy.<br /><br />Many people may find this film either too biased and cruel (conservatives) or too watered down (liberals), but at least Oliver Stone has once again placed a key figure on the screen for us all to ponder. In time this film will be better accepted, once the smoke clears from the past 8 eight years.  Grady Harp, February 09</p></body></html>

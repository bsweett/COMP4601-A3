<meta name="summary" content="The Price of Privilege"></head><body><p>On the day after he graduates from Med school in Scotland, smart-aleck, babe-in-the-woods, pie-in-the-sky, Nicholas Garrigan (a scruffy, semi-jerky James McAvoy) spins a world globe to decide where he will go to practice medicine and his finger lands on...Canada. Not exciting enough, so he spins again and it lands on Uganda. And so Nicholas jumps on a plane, having no idea whatsoever that the country is in turmoil socially and politically and goes to Uganda: land of Idi Amin (a massive, magnificent Forest Whitaker).<br />For most of "The Last King of Scotland," Nicholas lucks into much of what happens to him. What Nicholas doesn't realize, at first at least, is that he is not in control of the events of his life....the events are in control of him.<br />Much sooner than later, Nicholas is schmoozed by Amin himself to become Amin's personal doctor: a position that allows him entry into the personal as well as the political life of Uganda and of its leader. This of course proves to be a double edged sword and it is from the friction of this blade slicing through all strata's of Ugandan and Amin's life  from which the drama of this film is derived: privilege always comes with a price, political privilege  comes with a bill that inevitably finds us lacking the emotional currency to settle.<br />The big deal here is without a doubt Forest Whitaker's Idi Amin. Whitaker's resume is jam-packed with excellent performances: Bird in "Bird" to name one. But his Amin is a miracle: it's on a grand scale as befits its subject but it's also about the small nuances. Watch how his mind works behind his soulful, expressive eyes. There is an intelligence and heart at work here that cannot be ignored and for once after so many wonderful performances, Whitaker's day has arrived. And it's about time.</p></body></html>

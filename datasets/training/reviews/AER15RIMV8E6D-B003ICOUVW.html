Some parts seemed kind of boring and you just wanted Lawrence to turn into the Wolfman. Benicio del Toro was a perfect choice for Lawrence Talbot because he reminds me a lot of Lon Chaney Jr. When his brother Ben, is missing, Lawrence returns to his home town to investigate what happened. While visiting some gypsies, a werewolf comes and wreaks havoc. Lawrence is bit and slowly becomes one also. He tries to hide from Inspector Francis Aberline and seeks help from Gwen, his brother's fianc&eacute;e. I loved when Lawrence turned into the Wolfman, because that's what it's all about. I loved the gory death scenes. If you love the original classic, maybe you'll love THE WOLFMAN!!!</p></body></html>

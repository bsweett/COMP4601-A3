<meta name="summary" content="Good, not great"></head><body><p>The latest installment in the Superman series attempts to be consistent with the history, but leaves enough room for a new Superman to emerge:  One still in love with Lois Lane, one a little too overconfident for his own good, and perhaps too self-important for his own good.  The result is a movie that surpasses the last in the series (Did anyone dare see Superman IV?) but doesn't quite close it like a Rocky Balboa.<br /><br />Brandon Routh manages to make Clark Kent seem a little too cool, and Superman a little too dorky, but perhaps that's part of the act.  The movie is long - two and a half hours - and could've been clipped by thirty minutes without damaging anything.<br /><br />It's a worthy movie, but by no means must see.</p></body></html>

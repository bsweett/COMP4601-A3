I feel so dark inside I feel like I want to cry it's hard to live with a lie (this is a song).  Then the girl goes to her sister and says, "I took your necklace".  I think it was from the church of Latter Day Saints (if I messed that up and your a member, sorry).  No fear Superman is here and he doesn't lie!  He does however live one but there are reasons.<br /><br />What about the PSA about safety in the house and the pot of boiling water with the mean face.  The message was KEEP THOSE POT HANDLES TURNED IN, then the pot had a nice smiley face.  Or the plug that was a dangerous snake.  Superman has you covered he's impervious to heat.  Phew.  I better get a move on cause I'm pretty hungry.  I hanka for a hunka cheese yahoo.  Back to the review.<br /><br />I don't need to go into the plot it's Superman.  Entertainment wise it's a fun ride.  The score is classic, great, and makes me want to leap tall buildings.  The bad guys though and Lex just didn't do it for me.  They're bad guys for the sake of being bad guys, period.  I'll take Doc Ock and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMQW">Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)</a> personally.<br /><br />Supreman is still in my top three super hero movies and will be tons of viewers number 1.  For me I'll take <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OT6V00">Hellboy (Director's Cut) [Blu-ray</a>] and Spider Man 2, but the movie was still super.<br /><br />For home theater enthusiasts this could go in the reference pile.  Sound wise crank up the beginning and that song, whoo.  Good times.  And the picture quality on this was amazing as far as dvds go.  This dvd was recognized in Sound and Vision some time ago as a reference disc.<br /><br />So remember to eat your greens and have a super day.</p></body></html>

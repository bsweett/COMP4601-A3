Coming from a comic without an iconic hero like Superman or Batman, instead it had two men in suits.  When I saw the movie I was amazed at the funny chemistry between Will Smith and Tommy Lee.  It was almost like Alien Exterminator Odd Couple.  The Alien effects were very real but very cartoon-cool at the same time (come on Rick Baker worked on this film what do you expect.)  The movie was very funny, very thrilling, and very good.  I highly reccomend this film for anyone who loves action and sci fi.</p></body></html>

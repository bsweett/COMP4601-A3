He has a sense of visual style Terry Gilliam and Tim Burton might envy; and a willingness to explore the dark corners of human experience one sees in David Lynch - except that Lynch appears to do it simply out of an obsession with all that is perverse and depraved, while Cronenberg genuinely cares about his subjects, no mattered how tortured.  For an example of this try Spider, although Dead Ringers - even Naked Lunch - would serve just as well.<br /><br />Cronenberg secured his place at table with The Fly, a glossy, smart horror story about monstrous transformation.  The Fly is visually intoxicating, truly disturbing, and compelling because of the underlying humanity of its characters.  This formula set the tone for many pictures to come, and didn't really change fundamentally until History Of Violence - also starring Viggo Mortensen.  HOV plays like a straight gangster pic, however smart it may be.  (If you choose to watch it try to be absent from the room towards the end as William Hurt completely embarrasses himself.  Imagine your effeminate seventh-grade English teacher impersonating a mob boss.)<br /><br />In Eastern Promises Cronenberg returns to this approach but the result is far better.  This time the setting is London, with Russian mobsters providing the context.  I will avoid spoilers because some of the drama depends on surprise.  Let's just say that Viggo Mortensen presents an aura of "cool" unknown in any spaghetti shoot `em up known to me - including every Godfather picture - all 19 of them - and Goodfellas.  Compared to Nikolai, Mortensen, the spaghetti crowd is little more than a pack of wretched thugs in sharkskin suits lacking anything resembling morality or values, much less the ability to contain bestial impulses.  Their violence is ultimately thick headed, boorish, and pathetic.<br /><br />Nikolai, by contrast, moves with calm, detached deliberation.  He is aloof and genteel; you could chill your vodka in his hands.  Like any iceberg, you know there's plenty going on in the background - but he does not show his cards.  Mortensen deserves consideration at Oscar time.  Another way this movie trumps every spaghetti shoot `em up you've ever seen is that there is very little violence, but what there is, is so very personal.  Hollywood has long ago forgotten that guns render murder cheap and trivial by making it a detached act.  In Eastern Promises, if I promise to kill you, I will, and during the last moments of your life you'll be staring right into my eyes.  Cronenberg understands what most directors do not, violence only compels if one cares about the victim, and at the very least, understand the personality of the perpetrator.  Naomi Watts is a marvelous actress (remember Mulholland Drive - speaking of Lynch), I can't say she has much to do in EP, but what she does have she does well.  An exceptionally well made film.</p></body></html>

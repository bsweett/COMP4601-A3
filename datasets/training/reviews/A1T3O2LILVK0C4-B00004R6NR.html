In 1993 he managed to release films in both genres. First came Jurassic Park, a science fiction adventure based on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345370775">Michael Crichton's brilliant novel</a> and then came <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012QM8G">Schindler's List</a>, a Holocaust drama based on the haunting book by Thomas Keneally. Spielberg's filmed versions of these two stories were groundbreaking. Jurassic Park set a new standard for special effects in moviemaking, while Schindler's List proved that Spielberg could tell a serious, emotional story.<br />With Jurassic Park Spielberg had to overcome the gargantuan challenge of creating realistic, believable, lifelike dinosaurs that would share the screen with actors. There were a number of approaches that he considered for bringing the prehistoric titans to life. His first idea was to use full-size animatronic robots for all of the dinosaurs, but this was too costly and too dangerous to do (not to mention highly unrealistic as it would have required years of technicians developing new mechanical elements). His second idea was to use "go-motion" animation (a variation of stop-motion animation, in which a model is photographed one frame at a time in order to create the illusion of movement) to create the dinosaurs, but this proved to be too time consuming and lacked the photo-realism that he was striving for. Spielberg then gathered together some of the greatest minds in the special effects field. He and Dennis Muren, Phil Tippett, Stan Winston, and Michael Lantieri discussed the possibilities. Dennis Muren, who had just worked on the revolutionary computer-generated T-1000 character in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008PC2O">Terminator 2</a>, suggested that CG (Computer-Generated) dinosaurs might be their best bet. Spielberg was desperate for a quick solution so he told Muren to show him what could be done with CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) and Muren shocked Spielberg with a film clip showing skeletal dinosaurs running through a field. A later test, which was even more impressive, showed a tyrannosaurus rex stalking for its prey in the harsh sunlight (one of the most difficult illusions to create because of  the precision needed for believable lighting, reflectivity and shadows). Spielberg gave Muren the go-ahead and film history was made. Utilizing Dennis Muren's computer effects, Stan Winston's animatronics, and Phil Tippett's understanding of realistic movement they set out to create naturalistic dinosaurs. They even consulted Jack Horner, an esteemed paleontologist, to assist them in their efforts.<br />In June of 1993 the highly anticipated film was released to eager audiences. Both audiences and critics were blown away by the most realistic depictions of dinosaurs ever caught on film, but not everyone was wowed by the film itself. Some critics felt that the story was oversimplified, that the philosophical subtext of the novel was lost, and that the characters were shallow and uninteresting. Even so, the film was a worldwide success and spawned two sequels (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004U8JV">The Lost World: Jurassic Park</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXXS">Jurassic Park III</a>) and a boom in movie merchandising.<br /><br />The story focuses on an eccentric capitalist, John Hammond, who uses modern science to genetically engineer living dinosaurs from cloned DNA. He plans to open an amusement park on a remote island near Costa Rica, where people can observe and study these ancient leviathans for a price. However, Hammond is suffering from legal setbacks. His investors have doubts about the park's safety, so Hammond invites Alan Grant, a paleontologist and Ellie Sattler, a paleobotanist to visit and endorse the park. Also along for the ride are Ian Malcolm, a charismatic mathematician and an expert on Chaos Theory and Donald Gennaro, an irritatingly skeptical and greedy lawyer. Hammond even invites his two young grandchildren, Lex and Tim, saying that they are the target audience and therefore perfect to prove the potential allure of the park. But it's not long before Malcolm is proven right and chaos engulfs that island. One of Hammond's employees, Dennis Nedry, betrays him and steals dinosaur embryos, which he plans to sell to a rival research company. In order to obtain the embryos, Nedry turns off the park's automated security system. Naturally the dinosaurs escape and Jurassic Park ceases to be wonder to its visitors and begins to terrify them. During a tropical storm Alan and the two children are separated from the rest of the tour group and their weekend excursion becomes a frightening struggle for survival. Can they survive monstrous predators from the prehistoric past?<br /><br />Though the film doesn't match Spielberg's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008KLVG4">Jaws</a> in its portrayal of complex characters facing a primal force, it does succeed as an intense sci-fi thriller that will stun its viewers. The talented cast includes Sam Neill as Alan Grant, Laura Dern as Ellie Sattler, Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm, Richard Attenborough as John Hammond, Ariana Richards as Lex, and Joseph Mazzello as Tim. Other cast members include Samuel L. Jackson, Bob Peck, Martin Ferrero, B.D. Wong, and Wayne Knight.<br /><br />The DVD includes the following bonus materials: The making of Jurassic Park documentary, early pre-production meetings, animatics sequence, storyboards, dinosaur encyclopedia, production notes, cast and filmmakers' bios, and theatrical trailers for all three Jurassic Park films.<br /><br />I also recommend the beautifully evocative <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002OOY">soundtrack by John Williams</a>.</p></body></html>

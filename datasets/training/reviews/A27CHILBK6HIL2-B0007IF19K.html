<meta name="summary" content="1 Star For Universal Studios, 5 Stars For Ray"></head><body><p>This is not a review, but more of a rant on my part as a DVD Collector of 260+ DVD's. Please view this as an individual opinion on Universal, not on the content of the Film, Ray.<br /><br />  Does anybody else feel how unjust the price of the Limited Edition set is? I mean, how can Universal do this, this is legal crime, and it never ceases to amaze me.<br /><br />  Take this into consideration: The Schindler's List Limited Gift Set (Also A Universal Title) has the dvd, soundtrack, photo book, book style DVD case, film cell framed in printed cardboard, certificate of authenticity (even though they are meaningless), and a hard plastic sleeve that sits in a giant plexiglass box with metal support rods. Retail price = $34.98.<br /><br />  Ray Limted Edition has the DVD, pretty standard extras given comparison to DVD's like LOTR, Gone With The Wind, Panic Room, and many others, a book style DVD case with photo album attached within it. Retail Price = $44.98. At Best Buy, I paid $36.99 for my Ray Limited Edition, here on Amazon it was cheaper I remember but at the time I am writing this it is not in stock, Schindler's List Gift Set sells at Best Buy for $32.98, and only $24.49 here on Amazon. Return of the King Extended Edition, I paid $22.99 during the first week of release when it was on sale, on Amazon it's still an affordable $23.99. WHERE IS THE JUSTIFICATION IN THE PRICING??<br /><br />  Film Distributors are out of line, and will stay that way. You know why? Because we the consumer don't have a choice. Only Universal can sell Ray. So if I want a decent set of extras I have to pay, and I will fork over the cash, because it is the only way to get it. I wish there was a way for consumers to fight back without having to sacrifice our love for our favorite films, films that we want to own.<br /><br />  Also may I add that the video quality of this DVD is atrocious, very dull and grainy. No justice for the consumer, and none for the artists of the film and artist portrayed in the film.</p></body></html>

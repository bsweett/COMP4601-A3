<meta name="summary" content="Where is your flock going, shepherd?"></head><body><p>An intelligent spy story, somewhere along the tradition of John le Carre and Graham Greene, but set in the US intelligence environment, i.e. of course CIA and predecessors. Time is between early 40s and early 60s, so we get the world war, the cold war, some Central American adventures, and the Bay of Pigs disaster as main historical material. Throw in some African scenery.<br />Unfortunately the build-up of the plot is very very slow. It takes very long until one can put the jig saw pieces in a framework that seems to make some sense. Also unfortunately, the considerable acting skills of Matt Damon are somewhat wasted on a character that is so low key that he hardly ever develops real contours, despite overlength. Maybe the only remarkable aspect of his character seems to be a fetish for women with hearing problems. His main love Laura is deaf, and his only other affair needs a hearing aid (his German secretary, played by Martina Gedeck). Also unfortunately, Angelina is largely underutilized as un-loved wife of the ever absent spy. (I do not think she handles her predicament badly though.) Possibly she hears too well for Mr.Wilson's taste.<br />De Niro directs, and adds himself as a physically handicapped intelligence general who looks remarkably like Kissinger (but calls himself a Catholic). There is also Joe Pesci as a strange Italian character whose only function seems to be to provide Damon with his best line in the movie. I can not quote what Pesci said to Damon, since it is racist and Amazon's censors don't let me quote that. Damon answers: we (i.e. the WASPs) own America, you other guys are just visiting.<br />All in all: no waste of time, but also not completely pleasing.</p></body></html>

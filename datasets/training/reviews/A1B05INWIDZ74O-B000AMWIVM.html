<meta name="summary" content="Lots of blood and a Plot!"></head><body><p>When I sat down to watch this I had no idea what it was about. And it does not take long to find out. We start off with two men chain to opposite sides of a very grimy and disgusting large bathroom. In between them is the body of a man that shot himself in the head. The corpse has a gun in one hand and a tape player in the other. Everything just out of the two men's reach. And then the game begins; they each find an envelope in their pocket with tapes in them. And all they have is a hacksaw each that would never cut through the chains they wear.<br /><br />Then we watch as the story unfolds. The two victims figure out that an ingenious serial killer known as the jigsaw killer placed them there. This plot was well thought out. And the killer has left them no choice. They have to get out our pay the consequences.<br /><br />I do not know what those other reviewers are talking about. This is the first movie in a long time that I did not figure out who the killer was until they let us know. And I was surprised. This movie is worth watching. See if you can figure out who the killer is.</p></body></html>

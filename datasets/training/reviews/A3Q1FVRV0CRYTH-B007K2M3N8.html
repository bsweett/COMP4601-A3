What impressed me the most was Kevin Spacey.  Okay, we all know he can act, and flawlessly at that, but I never knew he could sing.  He has an amazing voice.  I want the soundtack just to listen to him.  Some parts were a little confussing, I couldn't tell if it was supposed to be 'real life' or his movie.  But I think I figured it out.  It was very well done.  Two thumbs up for Bosworth and Hoskins who both did AMAZING in there supporting roles, Bob, that's 2 for 2 now (watch Unleashed, not for the awsome fight scenes but for Hoskins who steals the show)...anyways, great movie, even better singing...and one heck of a good time.</p></body></html>

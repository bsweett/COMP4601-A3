<meta name="summary" content="Wow!  That just about says it all."></head><body><p>As with all of my reviews, I must say that I was not particularly fond of how often the "F" word was used in this film.  I think movie-makers get carried away with using profanity to make it all seem a bit more real.  But besides that one complaint, I think this movie is a thrill-a-minute ride that most people will enjoy. HOSTAGE delivers suspense, shock, and surprises throughout the entire film.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is excellent as the former hostage negotiator turned small town police chief.  His character ends up being drawn back into the role of negotiator, and Willis delivers the dialogue, the action, and the drama like only he can.  This is now my favorite Bruce Willis movie.  I think the originality of the script, combined with an awesome cast of actors and actresses made Willis shine more than in his past work.<br /><br />Kevin Pollak plays Walter Smith, a book-cooker with a high-tech DVD collection that adds a bit more saga to Bruce's unusually "bad" day.  Pollak's banter with his son and daughter sounded like the scriptwriter has been taping conversations in my living room!<br /><br />Jimmy Bennett (III) is Tommy Smith, a kid with some brain power...so much so that when he is asked by Willis to retrieve the "Heaven Can Wait" DVD, he thinks to look and see if there is more than one version of the film!  Now that's a smart kid.  Most adults don't even know there are two "Heaven Can Wait" movies.  Seriously though, this Jimmy Bennett kid, he's good.  I was actually yelling for him to crawl faster when the evil Mars was after him.  I think this kid has a bright future in Hollywood.<br /><br />This is without a doubt Michelle Horn's best work to date!  She gave Bruce a run for his money in this movie, nearly stealing the show.  I cannot say enough about her performance as Jennifer Smith; she had the drama, the tension, the fear, the...oh just insert every emotion one can display here ___________!  I said I think Jimmy Bennett has a bright future.  Well I KNOW Michelle Horn has bright past, present, and future.  This film should make her a superstar as far as I'm concerned.  If she pulled this off with such perfection, I don't think there is a role she couldn't pull off.<br /><br />Ben Foster plays the weird and completely insane Mars Krupcheck, a character that gave me the creeps!  Mars is evil through and through, and I think one of the things that makes HOSTAGE such a good movie is that Mars so personifies evil, while Tommy and Jennifer Smith represent innocence and purity - the clash of the two opposites creating such a clear view of evil and good that we tend to forget exist.<br /><br />Jonathan Tucker is a little weak in his performance as Mars's accomplice, Dennis Kelly.  It may have just been the script, not sure. Marshall Allman tries his best to make his character, Kevin Kelly, work, but it just wasn't his best performance.  Again, it may have just been the script.<br /><br />All of that about sums up what I thought about the movie and the performances.  This is a movie that provides the viewer with a great plot, a whole lot of action, some suspenseful moments, and a few unexpected twists.  I do not think young kids should watch this movie at all.  No one younger than thirteen should watch HOSTAGE, and I must once again say that I think the amount of profanity was a bit over the top, however, this is a movie about good and evil, so evil shouldn't be watered down too much.<br /><br />See ya next review!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kinda silly, but entertaining enough"></head><body><p>I guess I'm just weird cause I really think this movie is a major step down from the original.  Sure, I'd anticipate that the foolish masses to think that this was equal to or better thant he original; they might think anything.  But there are plenty of people out there whose opinions I respect who think that this film was pretty much a lateral move, and I don't quite get that.  So again, maybe I'm just strange.  And I'm not as in love with the original as some people are, mind you; I like it a helluva lot, and actually appreciate a lot more after seeing the sequel, but it's certainly got some flaws.  People always accuse sequels of being pale imitations of the original, and nowhere is that more true than here.  It's watchable enough, for sure, but it lacks the sorta novelty of the original, and the clever, interesting plot.  I'm not gonna tell ya that the plot for the original was terribly plausible, but it was very compelling, I felt, and just had a sort of continuity to it that 'Saw II' lacks.  That and it just contained a kinda central mystery as to just what the hell is going on, but here we already know the basics, and the connection between the characters in the room here proves to be fairly mundane and obvious.  Here we're just basically waiting for them to get on with it.  In 'Saw II' they basically stuff 8 or so people in a room and have them bicker and kill themselves in the traps while Donnie Wahlberg yells and yells and yells across town.  To be perfectly blunt, this is just too much for me to take it entirely seriously no matter how well it might be done.  First of all, Wahlberg tends to be way, way over the top.  People complained about the acting in the original, but he's a bigger problem here then anyone was there.  Also, this time around Jigsaw has just got a rather enormous funhouse of death, and it's all a bit too elaborate and comes across a bit silly much of the time.  There's just so much there, so many wacky traps and whatnot.  Some of these individual scenarios are pretty damn neat, I'll admit, though they occasionally feel like parody and just generally aren't as interesting as the ones in the original. (And certainly none of them can match the jaw trap from the original film.)  The one chick, Amanda, being dumped in the pile of discarded hypodermic needles is definitely the best.  Ouch.<br /><br />Furthermore, the new director just doesn't the sort of handle on the material that Wan had.  Darren Lynn Bousman seems like he's trying to hard to just imitate the style of the original, and most of the flashy, music-video style stuff just comes off as silly and overwrought.  (This happened some in the original as well, actually, but it was more contained and effective in general.)  The style of the original was derivative, but you get the idea that they were making it that way because that's how they wanted it to be.  Ya get the feeling that Bousman made the film this way because that's how it was supposed to be, and it just doesn't generate the same atmosphere.<br /><br />The film hinges on a final plot twist which I must admit is fairly clever.  Again, it's not terribly likely, but whaddya expect in this kinda movie.  It was amusing enough.  That goes for the film as a whole, but don't be expecting something too cohesive.<br /><br />Grade: C+</p></body></html>

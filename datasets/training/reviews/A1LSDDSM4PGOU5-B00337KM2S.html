<meta name="summary" content="breezy little film (3.5/5)"></head><body><p>this was in interesting little film.it's basically about a guy(George Clooney)whose job requires him to live out of a suitcase for at least two thirds of the year.he flies around the country to different companies and tells people they been terminated from their positions with their company.basically he feels most at home on the road,so to speak.there's more to the story than that,but you'll have to watch the film if you want you know more.i thought the dialogue was clever and witty and the chemistry between the actors was good.and Clooney creates a sympathetic character.Jason Bateman really impressed with a small role.overall,i felt this was a breezy little film,with some serious moments.for me,Up in the Air is a 3.5/5</p></body></html>

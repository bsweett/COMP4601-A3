<meta name="summary" content="Great art without any limits"></head><body><p>This film is a masterpiece. The last tycoon of the first half of the twentieth century. A power and an influence entirely based on newspapers and a new way to practice journalism : journalism as a reality show. Kane has the tendency though to think he can mould the opinions of people as if he controlled them through his papers. The film is a sad demonstration of the impact of such journalism and at the same time its limits and its failures. Actually he is destroyed in his political career by the same papers and journalism that all the other papers immediately imitated because the circulation of Kane&#65533;s papers was menacing the others to be crushed down into oblivion. But the film also explores the personal dimension of the character, his pharaonic ambition, his cult of collecting artistic artefacts or any other collectibles, his love for his second wife and its inevitable end because she could not live up to his dream of being some kind of king or god on earth. She felt abandoned and crushed by the famous palace of Xanadu and finally decided to leave. Strangely enough the film does not emphasize the death of his son, from his first marriage, a death that must have been particularly dramatic to Kane. The film is also a masterpiece by its technique and the way the story is unveiled and developed. It tried all kinds of story-telling techniques, a film in the film, a musical in the film, a jounalistic investigation within the journalistic world of Kane, and a completely exploded plot line that follows the investigation more than chronology. Things come apparently haphazardly though in an absolutely planned way. The structure is not clear cut and onesided, but rather a multifarious and multifacetted structure that gives to the film a tremendous power and dynamism.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

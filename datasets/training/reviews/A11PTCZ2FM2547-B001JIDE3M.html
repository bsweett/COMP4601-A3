<meta name="summary" content="Eh. . . . .whatever."></head><body><p>This (latest, mindless) remake of the Jules Verne classic is hopelessly silly, Brendan Fraser must possess an innate "annoyance" chromosome, and if I saw one more death-defying plunge down some endless abyss I was promising to scream louder than the actors.  Yet, oddly, indescribably, uncharacteristically, I found myself having a bit of fun watching this moronic bubble-gum version of JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH.  I'm just not going to tell anyone.<br /><br />Playing a pseudo scientist (which is fitting, as Fraser is a pseudo actor) journeying to Iceland with the young son (Josh Hutcherson) of his dearly-departed brother, Fraser's Professor Trevor Anderson comes under the tutelage of Hannah Asgeirsson (Anita Briem), the daughter of Trevor's brother's former mentor (huh?).  Hannah takes the two Americans on an Icelandic expedition, where they end up plunging down a hole and into a funky world of animated nonsense.  All the silliness is amplified by cornpone action sequences, yet I had to keep reminding myself this film was initially a 3D offering for kids (and Hutcherson darn sure plays to that audience), so it's all in good clean (sort of) fun.  The ending is predictably (and conveniently) over the top, and the plot instantly forgettable, but JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH is still worth one or two giggles and gaggles.<br />--D.

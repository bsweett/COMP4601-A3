<meta name="summary" content="'Chicago' truly has 'all that jazz'...and then some!"></head><body><p>`Chicago' is one of those films that, while not my favorite, captivates me from start to finish every time I sit down to watch it.  It's flawlessly directed and executed, brilliantly acted and otherwise advertised and comes off as the whole package, flawless from just about every angle.  Yes, some of you have mentioned that the lead actors voices aren't the greatest, and really, other than the magnificent John C. Reilly and the superb Queen Latifah the singing is below par as far as you would expect Broadway to be (Zellwegger and Gere have nothing on 2001's Kidman and McGregor).  But that's not really the point, because all the glitter and glam and attitude that drips forward with every word you begin to forget the fact that these people can't really sing.<br /><br />I for one felt that the entire cast (Gere aside) did an outstanding job, and yes, even Gere did fine, I just felt his Billy Flynn was a bit miscast.  Renee did an outstanding job as Roxie Hart, a girl dreaming of the big lights who murders her lover when he refuses to give her that.  She's imprisoned for it and its there that she meets Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones in her Oscar winning role) who is currently serving time for offing her husband and sister.  Through Matron `Mamma' Morton (Queen Latifah in the role that should have given her the Oscar) Velma has been set up with hotshot lawyer Billy Flynn, the best money can buy, and Roxie wants him too.  Left to pick up the bill is Roxie's loyal if not albeit na?ve husband Amos (Reilly in his Oscar nominated role...great year for him by the way) who seems to be being used by everyone.<br /><br />The film of course revolves around the court case and Roxie's determination to work the crowd, work the judge, the jury and the world in order to not only be released of all charges but become a star.  She of course has obstacles every step of the way, between Velma's jealousy, Billy's fleeting interest and her husbands growing distain.  The real shining areas here are of course wrapped up in the musical numbers, the shimmer and grace that lines every word, every scene, and every number.  Numbers like `Cell Block Tango' and `All I Care About' get the star treatment (and look wonderful) while songs like `Mister Cellophane' and `When You're Good to Mamma' shine brighter than the rest based on the voices alone.  One of my favorite numbers though is Catherine's `I Can't Do it Alone' just because of her sheer determination...she's wonderful.<br /><br />`Chicago' arguably deserved the Oscar (I'm still on the fence) but regardless it deserved to win or not, `Chicago' is still a brilliant musical that any fan of the Broadway play or fan of the musical in general will enjoy.  Rob Marshall did deserve that Best Director Oscar, I will say that.  His direction here couldn't have been better.  `Chicago' is a film that will never grow old, never grow tired and never leave my collection.</p></body></html>

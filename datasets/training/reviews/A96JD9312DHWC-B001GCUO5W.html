<meta name="summary" content="A broken puzzle sometimes lies"></head><body><p>Something has happened on Shutter Island and it is up to two law enforcement officals to figure out what. One is a seasons veteran and the other is his new partner, and they both find themselves pulled into something that seems much more difficult than a case of a missing woman. This leads the lead detective to question what is going on, and before long he finds himself wondering what secrets lie in this place that holds so many secrets about everything - including himself.<br /><br />On many levels, I thought this film was a great piece of work. It had all the elements one would want from a movie develing into a place that treats the worst types of criminal minds, with it looking at everything through the eyes of both patients and detectives. It has secret plots and twists, a lot of things you can't trust, and a plot that leaves you wondering what Leo really knows as he walks through his investigation.<br /><br />There were a few times in the movie I found myself able to predict what was going on, and some of that really hurt the ending. I think that is because movies have to have some catch these days, but this catch is one that is both interesting and hard to talk about without saying too much. If, for instance, you review for content, you will say too much. Even discussing characters says some things that possibly shouldn't be said. So, instead of going that route, I will simply say that the plot is great, the effects have an impact, and the end is one that completes a puzzle and makes you feel sorrow at the same time.<br /><br />Would I say buy this film? I'm torn on that one. I would say that you would like to watch it more than once, and that it would be something that makes more sense as you catch all the little pieces. Still, I didn't benifit from the buy itself because I watched all these parts all at once, but cannot find a reason that a person would not want to buy it simply because it has so much to offer.<br /><br />Read reviews on it, be really careful if a person says anything about spoilers, and enjoy your film. You will enjoy it, too, because it is hard not to. Its like a puzzle you have to put together and, when you do, you find yourself rewarded.<br />Personally, I liked what Leo did here, and the way his character brings everything to light.</p></body></html>

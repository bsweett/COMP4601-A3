This science fiction adventure combines Flash Gordon with Fritz Lang's classic Metropolis creating a unique look for this pulp adventure. Jude Law stars as the wizard of the skies Joe Sullivan (AKA "Sky Captain") and Gwyneth Paltrow plays his love interest reporter Polly Perkins in an adventure where the existence of our world is threatened by a mad scientist (Laurence Oliver in a beyond-the-grave cameo performance that could only happen with the advent of digital technology. bend on wiping out humanity. Angelina Jolie turns in a wonderful cameo as the eye patch wearing pilot Captain `Franky' Cook. No pulp adventure would be complete without a plucky sidekick winningly embodies by the marvelous Giovanni Ribisi. While there are some time flight actors here, the real star of this movie is director/writer Kerry Conran who toiled for years in obscurity to make this film a reality. A fun visual feast featuring references to everything from King Kong to Marathon Man, Sky Captain turns into a treasure trove of other film experiences packed into an exciting adventure that everyone from kids to adults will enjoy. While it may not be high art, like Raiders of the Lost Ark its marvelous fun.<br /><br />Discussing the image quality is subjective here for a number of reasons. Since this film is designed to look highly stylized with gauzy soft focus and simulation of the old two color Technicolor process (which always seemed trapped between the world of color and black and white), it's hard to compare it to other films or their look. I can compare it to the original theatrical version of the film. Sky Captain on DVD carefully captures the look, texture and rich surreal color of the original theatrical version of the film. At times the images almost look like they revert to black and white imagery with touches of gray, flesh tones and light blue all capturing the look of early Technicolor films.  The 5.1 surround sound mix actively moves from speaker to speaker keeping in perfect step with the action and draping the listener in the experience of the film.  With witty visual allusions to the original RKO Radio logo, pulp fiction heroes of the 30's and early 40's and other films Sky Captain plays like an old film fan's wet dream.<br /><br /> "Brave New World" consists of  two documentaries on the making of the film. The first part focuses from conception to the birth of the six minute film Conran used to sell Jon Avent on making a feature film (which is included as an extra and with many images that ended up in the finished film with better detail) through to the design of the characters, robot monsters and the inspiration that they used from the pulp magazines. Part two discusses the actual production of the film and how it moved from the idea of using actual pictures of the late 30's and early 40's of New York as back plates to creating a highly stylized city in the computer for the actors and CGI creatures to interact in. Most of the six minute film was created with second hand computers. Sky Captain and the Flying Legion in the World of Tomorrow: Chapter One Mechanical Monsters (made on an old Apple Two) was presented to Paramount after the initial six minute demo was presented and Gwyneth Paltrow had signed on. Since there were virtually no sets Conran and visual effects people were constantly challenged by issues such as disc space, system failures and other gremlins that dog the computer world. Amazingly shot on a budget of $40 million and having to call in other effects houses at the last minute to help bring the film in on time and on budget, Sky Captain managed to walk the highwire of technology, creativity & commercial projects from Hollywood and be entertaining.<br /><br /> We get a comprehensive commentary track by the director and visual effects supervisors who discuss some of the more complex shots, visual tributes to other films and what's real and what's not. Overall, a fine commentary track that balances technical discussions with stuff that will interest the average film fan.<br /><br /> A fun bit of cinema that recalls Raiders of the Lost Ark with its retro feel and the serials of the 30's and 40's with the wit and technology of the 21st century, Sky Captain has all the fun that was squeezed out of franchise films, sequels and witty performances to boot. Sure, it's an imperfect film as the script occasionally reaches for more than it can convincingly pull off but for sheer visual style and ambition Sky Captain can't be beat.</p></body></html>

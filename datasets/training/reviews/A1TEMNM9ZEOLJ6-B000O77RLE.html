The tale told from Japan's perspective grows a little tedious, but you do see things from an alternate point of view. The praise is somewhat unwarranted, because, ultimately, there is nothing especially revealing or surprising here, just an expected take on what it must have been like to be a Japanese soldier on Iwo Jima. Worth watching in tandem with the other film, at your leisure.</p></body></html>

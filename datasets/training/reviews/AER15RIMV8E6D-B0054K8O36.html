<meta name="summary" content="Captain Jack is Back With a Vengeance!!!"></head><body><p>I'll admit that this installment is better than the previous two movies, but definitely not better than the original. Only Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, and Gibbs return for this adventure. Elizabeth, Will, Pintel, Ragetti, Cotton, and Marty are gone, but it's still an interesting hilarious action-packed new chapter in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise. Jack is still up to his old tricks and is asked by King George II to lead an expedition to find the Fountain of Youth. Jack must soon deal with his former lover, Angelica, who happens to be the daughter of the new villian, Blackbeard. They need the tear of a Mermaid and two silver chalices to make the fountain work. If you love the series, and especially Captain Jack Sparrow, you'll love PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES!!!</p></body></html>

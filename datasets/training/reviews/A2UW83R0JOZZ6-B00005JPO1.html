Sorry to say that my intuition serves me well.  "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is a film that is poorly constructed, a film that fed the mouth of hype and left a bitter taste on the palate of its viewers as well as excess calories of criticism.  I find it hard to concentrate on anything other than its flaws and I am deeply disappointed in a filmmaker whom I thought incapable of surrendering to the push of a mass-marketed film.<br /><br />This latest Indy installment gets off to a busy start with a trip to the warehouse where the infamous Arc of the Covenant ended up in the first film.  Among a small caravan of vehicles is Indiana Jones (Ford), a captive of a zealous band of Russian soldiers, his new nemesis in lieu of the Nazi regime.  The Cold War has Stalin's army looking for any possible advantage over their adversaries and it comes in the form of a strange skull made entirely of pure crystal.  Jones manages to escape from their clutches but crosses paths with them again when a rebellious high school dropout named Mutt (LaBeouf) beseeches him to help locate a missing professor (Hurt).  The rest of the movie has Jones and Mutt dodging fists, swords, poison arrows, bullets and creepy crawlies to retrieve and return this mysterious artifact.<br /><br />Production values on this particular venture are glaringly overblown; the end result is elaborate sets that look anything but ancient and fantastically awful action sequences that require strict suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />The script could've used a minor overhaul - the storyline/plot leaves much to be desired and there are one too many cheesy lines and maudlin moments.  The editing is a bit questionable as well; one particular chase sequence goes on for far too long.  In fact, most of the film falls prey to these painstakingly choreographed scenes replete with fisticuffs, swordplay, gunfire and cars/trucks crashing and/or blowing up while the meager plot creeps miserably into the background.  "Raiders", "Temple" and "Last Crusade" all had religious themes coupled with the turbulent backdrop of World War II.  "Crystal Skull" blazes ahead to the late 50's and has nothing to show for it except some lame theory about Roswell, the Mayans and alien artifacts.<br /><br />Spielberg has done better work than this - the previous Indiana Jones films are proof-positive.  This has no place with his beloved saga and instead reigns supreme as a super-charged popcorn action flick.<br /><br />On the upside, no one gives a bad performance despite the somewhat lackluster screenplay.  Ford is a bit toned down, seeming to relish his role as an older and wiser Henry Jones Jr.  John Hurt is under-utilized as is Ray Winstone.  LaBeouf is passable as Mutt, a leather-jacketed motorcycle enthusiast who flagrantly sports the James Dean guise that was so de rigeur of the time.  It's great to see Karen Allen again but her reprise as Marian Ravenwood is disappointing - she's missing much of the spark she touted in "Raiders".  As the film's villain, Blanchett probably treated this more as a pet project than serious acting work because an actress of her caliber just doesn't belong here (her Russian lilt doesn't hold strong either).  Broadbent is the most pleasing of the smaller roles, equal to that of Denholm Elliot as Marcus Brody.<br /><br />Bottom line: I give 2.5 stars for Ford, Broadbent and Allen and a story that would've been great had it not been in the hands of such mediocre screenwriters as David Koepp and (sigh) George Lucas.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Much better than I thought."></head><body><p>Considering how much I really despise Beyonces group Destinys Child I kept my expectations for this movie relatively low. I was so sick and tired of hearing that strongly annoying voice on the radio and people shoving that DC krap in my face. <p>However my expectations were completely blown away and Goldmember turned out to be my favorite of the Austin Powers saga. <p>The jokes that dominated the first two flicks are continued in the third installment of the bunch. Austin Powers is one a mission to stop a crazed man from using a magnetic beam to cause an giant asteroid to collide with earth. Plus Austin has to rescue his long lost father by the name of Nigel Powers. <p>My favorite part was where Austin Powers met Britney Spears in the awful Boyz video when it turns out that the Britney in the movie was actually a fembot. I literally laughed when I saw the fembot blow up. <p>While the female charachter Foxy Cleopatra did get on my nerves at the beginning I must say she turned out much better than I thought. While I don't have much respect for Beyonce Knowles in terms of music she could gain my respect in terms of being an actress. <p>So far one of the best theatrical releases of 2002! I'm looking forward to the fourth installment whenever that comes out.</p></body></html>

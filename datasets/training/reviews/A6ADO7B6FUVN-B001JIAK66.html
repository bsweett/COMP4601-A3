This tale begins where Van Helsing has just finished a mission involving Mr. Hyde, and now Van Helsing is about to embark on a new mission with werewolves, vampires, Frankenstein, and Dracula.  This means that Van Helsing must travel to Transylvania where Dracula and his cohorts reside.  When Van Helsing arrives to the mountains of Transylvania he meets Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale).  Together Van Helsing and Valerious bring more death and destruction to the monsters that cross their path using high-tech weapons made by Van Helsing's follower fryer Carl.  Van Helsing is a movie with visual eye candy that is strikingly spectacular as almost every scene has computer generated images and extraordinary heroism.  This initially leads the movie into a cinematic action experience.  However, the cinematic experience is spoiled as the movie is almost utterly supported by characters telling the audience what they are going to do and not leaving anything for the imagination.  These verbal cues are often redundant and very little story is supported with visual cues besides the combat and rescue scenes.  These combat and rescue scenes are most often extremely far-fetched, which lends very little support to any suspense.  Instead, the suspense is neglected with absurd shoot 'em and beat 'em up scenes.  Lastly, there are occasions with situational comedy, which lightens up the cinematic experience, but it does not save this absurd cinematic experience as it goes into a downward spiraling pattern from the beginning.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Modern Day Version of an Old John Wayne Movie"></head><body><p>John Singleton directed this very well done action drama that plays like a modern day version of the old John Wayne western, THE SONS OF KATIE ELDER.<br /><br />When their adopted mother is shot down, ostensibly by two gang members in a convenience store robbery, her four sons return to their Detroit home to attend her funeral and to also see that the killers are brought to justice.<br /><br />None of these men (Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin, Garrett Hedlund) would qualify as "citizen of the year," and, in fact, some of them have had their own problems with the law.<br /><br />It doesn't take long for the brothers to discover that Mom was not the victim of a simple hold-up, but was the target of a assassination plot.  Now, the quartet has to discover who put out the "contract," and for what reason.  Their heavy-handed investigation turns up the name of a local drug lord, and also exposes some police corruption.<br /><br />There are some terrific action sequences in this film, particularly a fantastic shootout at the mother's home that leaves a street filled with dead bodies.<br /><br />Terrence Howard co-stars as an honest cop.<br /><br />DVD extras include director commentary, deleted scenes and several "Making of" featurettes.  One of them shows how the aforementioned shootout was staged.<br /><br />? Michael B. Druxman</p></body></html>

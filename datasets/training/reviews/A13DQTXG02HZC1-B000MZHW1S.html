<meta name="summary" content="T.I.A (This is Africa)"></head><body><p>This is an ambitious project that tries to deal with issues such as child soldiers, diamond smuggling, civil wars, helplessness of foreign aids in Africa. As said by characters in the movie, it's T.I.A.  It's all about survival & generally, people need to be ruthless to get through yet another day. Once again, Edward Zwick, the Director who has brought us Glory, Legends of the Fall, the Last Samurai brings us a very emotive movie that strikes all the right chords without becoming cliche oversentimental.  He's helped a great deal by depths of actors & actress such as DiCaprio, Hounsou, & Connelly. Everyone has their own agendas and as we gradually dig beneath the surface, we find humanity that lurks within.  There is vulnerable time where DiCaprio's character, Archer cracks & he divulges to audience what makes him the person that he is.  And so does Connelly's character of why she risks it all when she can lead an ordinary life.  Hounsou's character is more straight-forward, where he would do anything to get his family back.  Overall, the movie is very powerful & well-done.  Despite different movies that Edward makes, one can't help but seeing similarity in themes that he's exploring.  In Glory, there's Denzel Washington who's all proud & full of honour. In Samurai, there's Tom Cruise's character who can't face himself for catastrophe that he wrecks upon innocent Indians, & in Legends of the Fall, there's Brad Pitt who runs away because he feels he has failed his brother who perishes in the World War.  In this instance, there's DiCaprio who feels the shoes.  In the end, the main characters redeem themselves by doing deeds that put everything right.  James Newton Howard who provides soundtrack for King Kong does a marvellous here too.  Overall, this is a tour-de-force that keeps audience like myself thinking & something to be seen on the big screen.  Highly recommended and a movie that makes you think twice next time before you commit yourself buying a diamond for your dearly beloved.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The little film that stole America's heart..."></head><body><p>During the 2006 Awards Season there was no film that made an impact quite like `Little Miss Sunshine'.  You can argue and say that `The Departed' made such an impact, beings that it did walk away with top honors, but seriously, no one was talking about `The Departed' like they were talking about `Little Miss Sunshine'.  It became a phenomenon.  The following year `Juno' waltzed up to an Oscar nomination thanks to the success this little yellow bus and even this years `Slumdog Millionaire' is being called the `Little Film that Could'.  `Little Miss Sunshine' represents that little independent film that garners cult status quickly and finds a place in the hearts of award bodies everywhere.<br /><br />Now I liked this movie, but personally it isn't deserving of the unabashed praise it received.  It's actually quite common and not very imaginative when you think about it.  It's sweet and charming but nothing new, and while it has it's moments of wit it also has awkward moments that you know are supposed to be funny, but just aren't.<br /><br />It's a mixed bag for me.<br /><br />The film follows the Hoover family (as dysfunctional as they come) as they embark on a cross country trip to get young Olive to a beauty pageant.  Richard, the father, is a self obsessed man who aspires to get famous off his step program to a better you.  His wife Sheryl is merely trying to hold together her family while remaining remotely sane.  Their oldest son Dwayne has taken a vow of silence while he waits to join the Air Force.  Richard's father Edwin is a foul mouthed gruff drug addict with a heart of gold and Sheryl's brother Frank is a suicidal teacher who is crumbling emotionally after a sour relationship with a male student.  Stuck in the middle is young impressionable Olive who just wants to be pretty.<br /><br />Everything that can go wrong does go wrong, but tagged onto the end of this comedy is a message of togetherness and family; a spark of sweet saccharine goodness that makes you feel a little better about yourself and your loved ones.  I understand why people like this film; even I liked it, but I find it hard to consider it the best of anything.<br /><br />Breslin is a natural talent; very genuine and believable.  One friend of mine said that he never caught her acting, which is very true.  I have always liked Kinnear and I found his turn here probably best in show.  He was superbly entertaining and understandable as the controlling father obsessed with winning.  Toni Collette continues shining her beacon of light on everything she touches; and I adore her for that.  There was a lot said about the supporting actor race that year and the three `Sunshine' men; Alan Arkin, Steve Carell and Paul Dano.  Honestly I fell that AMPA's got this one right, and I know that not many agree with me there.  I thought that Arkin was very genuine and heartwarming here, even at his crudest.  No, he should not have won, but that's beside the point.  Carell was also very warm here and understood his character (what a stretch for him) and Dano was interesting yet a little vapid.  I found his emotional breakdown rather hard to believe, but he does try really hard so I'll give him props for that.  He stepped up his game in a HUGE way the following year with a stellar performance in `There Will Be Blood'.<br /><br />Truth be told, the funniest parts in this movie involve running, and just the sight of any of the cast barreling down a street or a parking lot gives me the giggles.  It is also a true statement that some parts of this film fall flat.  Like I said; a mixed bag.  It's fun, but not great.  You will enjoy it, but if you walk into this expecting it to deliver on all the hype you may find yourself disappointed.</p></body></html>

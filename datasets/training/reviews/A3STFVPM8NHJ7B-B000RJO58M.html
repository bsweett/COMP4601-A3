<meta name="summary" content="Few laughs"></head><body><p>I couldnt wait to see this movie. I bought it and watched it right away. I was expecting some great things considering these guys made Shaun of the Dead. The first half hour flew by and I was bored. No real laughs just a typical movie. When he movies to the new town, there are a few laughs scattered thru out by it was disappointed. I love horror movies and I was surprised at how gory this movie was. It kind of reminded me of Broken Lizards. They released an amazing film, Super Troopers, then followed it up with a horror comedy that was bad, Club Dread. While these men did make a horror comedy that is probably one of the best ive ever see, this was suppose to be an action comedy. The ending of the movie was pretty sweet though.</p></body></html>

Oh where oh where can they be?<br /><br />Okay, so I didn't go into The Crazies thinking that I'd find a 5-star movie here, but, man, have movies been mostly subpar for the last year (several years?) or what? I mean I think that I gave <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00275EGX8">The Hurt Locker</a> 5 stars, but prior to that I honestly can't remember the last movie that I rated 5 stars. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AVCFK6">Star Trek</a> maybe? And even 5 stars for those were generous. Anyway, I digress....<br /><br />So with The Crazies you have a remake of an apparent George A. Romero original that surprisingly I'd never seen or even heard of. Not surprisingly The Crazies has a government conspiracy gone awry that turns ordinary people into crazed loonies (like zombies). Surprisingly they got a great talent like Timothy Olyphant to sign on for the lead in the film and he is a stand out. Not surprisingly one man does not a great movie make, and The Crazies falls apart by its finish with the notion that the government will not only commit mass atrocities of epic proportions on its own soil but would be able to keep it all on the down-low from us silly citizens.<br /><br />The Crazies does have its creepy moments though. I admit that I was entertained. And Olyphant and even costar Radha Mitchell turned in excellent performances; they saved the movie from being utterly unbelievable and silly. And hey, I can do silly. But you don't want the silly label unless you're trying to be silly, right? Like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KQNL8">Return of the Living Dead Part II</a> (Remember? Brains! Brainnnns!) was trying to be silly so it worked. Good silly. You don't want bad silly. Olyphant and Mitchell saved The Crazies from bad silly.<br /><br />Check out The Crazies if you're into the genre and you've got nothing better in your queue, but just don't expect <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VDDWEC">28 Days Later</a>. If you must have a Romero remake that's excellent, I'd recommend Tom Savini's 1991 version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K3TO">Night of the Living Dead</a>.</p></body></html>

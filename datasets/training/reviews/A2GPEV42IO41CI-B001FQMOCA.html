Johnny grew up poor on a cotton farm, listening to June Carter and her family sing on the radio.  He married a girl from home, worked as a door-to-door salesman, and started singing, but his wife was jealous of Johnny's career and his time away from home.  He met June and was smitten, but they were both married; they continued to tour together for years, through June's second marriage and Johnny's terrible drug abuse.  June helped him kick his habit and later, Johnny proposed to her onstage.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the songs in the movie a lot; I was especially impressed that Phoenix and Witherspoon did their own singing and playing and made it look so easy.  Phoenix's Johnny is a tortured and self-destructive soul, and Witherspoon's June is spunky, kind, and mature. This is surely the best movie for both of them to date.  They have great romantic chemistry on-screen and their close-ups are intense! The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, especially Robert Patrick as Johnny's mean and unrepentant father.  I heartily recommend "Walk the Line;" it is an emotional roller-coaster of highs and lows, with a lot of entertaining music and two very likeable stars.<br /><br />Kona</p></body></html>

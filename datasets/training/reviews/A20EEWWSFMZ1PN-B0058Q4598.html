<meta name="summary" content="I came to save the world.  You mean us?  No the world."></head><body><p>A mysterious being comes from outer space. SecDef Regina Jackson (Kathy Bates), Wants to squish it like a bug before it does the same to us with her philosophy of do unto others before they do unto you. Dr. Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) wants to set it free as she thinks it is cute and harmless. Jacob Benson son of Helen Benson is a lying cheating sneak who finds this poor alien something to practice on. But why has this alien being, Klaatu come? He claims it is to save the Earth.<br /><br />This is one of those films less than crank out in seven days. Throwing out everything except for the names of the original story, and replacing the story with a thinly veiled not well thought out "go green" theme. Computer graphics replaced the acting. This version of the story lost all of its original charm and the aw and wondering of what could be out there. An innocent boy is replaced by a snotty -brat. A quasi-scientific politically correct female replaces a hard-working secretary. Keanu Reeves does as well as one can with the neo-Klaatu character. Jennifer Connelly relies on her eternal cuteness to carry her through the unbelievable character. Kathy Bates is just as scary as ever (good job Kathy.)<br /><br />Blu-ray cannot save this dog that cannot hunt.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKFR">The Day the Earth Stood Still</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305428360">Little Buddha</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600893163">The Day the Earth Stood Still & Other Sf Classics</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0884110915">Questor Tapes</a></p></body></html>

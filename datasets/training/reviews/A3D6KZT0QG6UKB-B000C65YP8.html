<meta name="summary" content="Amazing Movie"></head><body><p>2005 seemed to be the year when directors jumped on their soap boxes and said "Pay Attention to the world!" with overtly political movies like Munich, Syriana, Good Night & Good Luck. Lord of War didn't make as much money or garner as much critical acclaim as the other movies on the list, but it was certainly a better movie.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage turns in one of his most nuanced performances since Leaving Las Vegas as a arms dealer who started out selling ammunition to the gangsters in his neighborhood and quickly rose to the international stage with the end of the Cold War. His international dealing in all the war zones from Lebananon to Liberia gives us some of the best camera work this side of Brokeback Mountain. Cage's dry one liners keep the movie going even as he reveals himself to be a despicable creep (but with the African death squads that buy his weapons, he is comparitively decent) who even attracts the moral disgust of other arms dealers represented by Ian Holm who actually have an agenda in their business practices. Cage's wit in delivering the lines like "I didn't supply Osama Bin Laden, not out of moral reasons. He was bouncing checks at the time." keep you from outright hating him.<br /><br />Jared Leto provides the moral center of the movie as the troubled brother who initially helps Nicholas Cage, but can't handle the guilt from being responsible for so many deaths. In another world, this movie would be Jared Leto's story and he is certainly proving himself up for the task of carrying his own movie. Ethan Hawke spins his wheels as the ATF agent out to nail Cage, but he's largely in the background.<br /><br />Despite the way the plot apes Goodfellas, you never feel like you are watching a morality tale. Cage is in a much more dangerous business than being a gangster and his choices sustain and doom him.<br /><br />Actually the movie's opening sequence of the path of the bullet from factory to crates to boxes to boy's head tells you all you need to know about this movie. It's fun. It's witty and ironic, but ultimately it is dealing with some very serious issues and the serious consequences of being alive in a post-Colonial, post-Cold War era in which no side is clear, but the guns are in ready supply.</p></body></html>

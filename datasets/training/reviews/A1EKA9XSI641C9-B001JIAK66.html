The Mummy Returns was only crap in my opinion because of the terrible CG effects, other than that it was pretty consistent in quality.  Van Helsing somehow tries to combine The Wolfman, Dracula, and Frankenstein into one movie called Van Helsing.  Though, Van Helsing is not the same character from Dracula and really has nothing to do with anything.  The mythologies of these three worlds are completely wasted for some crappy "comedic" lines and some overblown special effects.  The movie runs about 2 hours and 12 minutes and could've been edited to the pace that it was meant for.  Heck, it might have even been a good movie if it wasn't so long.  This film just reminds me of the 1979 Universal Dracula remake, which was crap as well and that's because it tried too hard to be great like it's predecessors, and with the classic Universal horrors you can't do that.  That's why The Mummy was good.  So, I say unless you like modern movies and their special effects circuses you might like this, but if you're a fan of respectable movies you'll recognize it as trash.</p></body></html>

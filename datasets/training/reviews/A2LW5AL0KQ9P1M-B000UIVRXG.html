Following the daunting success of "Shaun of the Dead," it seemed this duo was doomed to failure (just in the same way that Broken Lizard could never SEEM to live-up to their epic-success "Super Troopers"). Nonetheless, "Hot Fuzz" is equally as clever, insightful, and hysterical as their popular zombie flick. And, equally as niche: comedy-mystery! What's more, if you are hesitant to purchase this film for fear of not understanding "British humor," you can dismiss those worries entirely!! While this film's humor transcends cultural-boundaries, you may find it amusing that it makes constant reference to popular American film ("Point Break" and "Bad Boys" being the most obvious) and popular American culture (like Judge Judy). Moreover, it is helpful to watch the film with the captions on ... this way some of the  subtle word-play will be more easily caught (like the Judge Judy bit!!)<br /><br />Stylistically, the film is a gem! If only American comedy was this slick! The framing is spectacular! As well as the repetition of shape!! (Like the spiral of the tombola drum juxtaposed with the spiral of the church stair-case ... so smart, so funny, so very pleasing!!) And in "Hot Fuzz," you will find echoes of "Shaun of the Dead." Most prominent, you will note an emphasis on day-to-day rituals: "What will it be? (The pub)" "Do you want anything from the shop?" ... and then how these rituals are "turned on their head" by the film's conclusion. The result is deeply satisfying for the viewer. Likewise, you will find a similar soundtrack and use of cuts (like the "swish" sounds and quick cuts to indicate ritual). Again, both are tremendously successful and a hallmark of either Wright's direction or how this team elects to communicate ideas.<br /><br />If you dig cop-comedy, buddy-flicks, the previous works of Pegg and/or Wright, or (one of my favorite Broken Lizard films) "Club Dread" (another comedy-mystery), you should thoroughly enjoy "Hot Fuzz."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="POLAR EXPRESS COULD HAVE BEEN WARMER"></head><body><p>I had read that this movie cost 160 million to make, and the special effects are amazing at times, but I really could not get into the weird digital animation, it was like the characters were alien, I could not really connect with any of the leads, especially the main character, he seemed so void of emotion and otherworldly, I mean could they have at least made their eyes not so dead?  On some level the film is quite beautiful, and I appreciate the enormous amount of work it took to get this film to look this way..I realize Zemikis was trying to give the movie the look of the books amazing illustrations and again on one level it works, but it sort of takes all the feeling out of the movie, I never really felt vested in the outcome of this kids trip, and the beginning of the movie, with the hobo on the top of the train was not only bizarre but more than a little spooky and i never really got his revelevance, he was never properly explained.  Hanks voices several character and he is alright i guess, but frankly they could have saved the money on his salary and gotten some unknown, I mean who really cared if Hanks was the voice?  I hope he at least did this thing for scale, but im doubting it.  I did like how the setting was the 50's, it added to the nastalgia and the CGI North Pole was fantastic, but the story waxed and wained and took a long time to get going, all and all hardly "A Christmas Story".</p></body></html>

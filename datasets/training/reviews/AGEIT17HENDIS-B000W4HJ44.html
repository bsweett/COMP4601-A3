<meta name="summary" content="In The Time Of The Great Teenage Bustout"></head><body><p>If I were reviewing this off-beat musical comedy from a political perspective I would have to classify this film about the virtues of  show tunes as a tool for racial harmony in early 1960s Baltimore, before the out-front racial polarization of the city were exposed and Spiro Agnew hit the scene, as an integrationist's daydream, and a segregationist's nightmare. And at that political level the theme just doesn't work, although the sub-theme about accepting differences (racial, ethnic, gender, size) has a certain appeal. But all of this is to take this sweet fluff of a film way beyond those rationale political parameters.<br /><br />What does work? Well, a nice little odd-ball, not exactly cookie-cutter American family, circa 1960, with some big dreams and some big women (?) get to play center stage in the quest for the American dream, or one of the early 1960s variant of it- stardom in the music and/or television world.  The current "American Idol" is only the latest in a long line of such efforts. Here the plot revolves around becoming "top dog" on one of the old after school dance shows that were a staple of 1950s-early 1960s television to keep restless kids under control for a few hours until dad got home. To that extent the plot is just a ruse for some great songs about those above-mentioned social differences and how to deal with those differences in a quirky and dreamy interracial way.<br /><br />The real kicker here though are the performances of John Travolta (yes, that John Travolta) as the over-sized mother, Edna, who can still dance up a storm, the usually bad guy-playing Christopher Walken as the supportive and skinny dad, Wilbur, and normally good girl, and always femme fatale Michelle Pfeiffer, as the plotting television station manager makes this thing appealing to a non-teenager. And, of course Queen Latifah being, well.... Queen Latifah. The high school kids led by Tracy (Nikki Blonsky), black and white, good or bad, sweet or vicious are just there to glue this thing together. Watch this couple of hours of an integrationist's daydream.</p></body></html>

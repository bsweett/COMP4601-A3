<meta name="summary" content="A halfway decent " Vs." horror movie"></head><body><p>What can I say, the more sequels they make for these 2 characters, the cheesier it gets. At one time these movies where serious, now they are more for laughs. This one did however manage to do a better job than I anticipated. They successfully made a plot that incorporated both characters in it and made it seem somewhat legitimate. The movie seemed to move a little slower though than some of the pervious movies in either series. It also seemed to have a lot less blood than the earlier Nightmare On Elmstreet's and Friday the 13th' movies. It was more like an over rated pro-wrestling event that builds up to 2 characters battling it out for a fake heavy weight belt.  I still however enjoyed it, and I did not have high hopes for it to begin with.</p></body></html>

She makes June Carter Cash real, she does not play her like a saint, she shows her flaws, but also her inner strength and goodness.  You really buy her deep love for Cash, it's really a career performance.  The movie itself is well paced and you stay with it, at first I thought it ended a bit abruptly, but thinking back on it, the ending was true to the film.  Highly recommended...thanks James.</p></body></html>

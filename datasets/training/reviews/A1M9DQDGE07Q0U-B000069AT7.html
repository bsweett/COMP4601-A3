<meta name="summary" content="Flying High With Elliott"></head><body><p>E.T. finally makes its way to DVD via two versions, the original theatrical cut and the 2002 remastered and retouched version that director Steven Spielberg revisited.  I must confess, the differences between the two versions are minimal, reminding me of how well done the effects were the first time around.  Still, the subtle added touches that have been incorporated into the 2002 cut, while I don't feel add anything fresh to the enjoyment of the film, nevertheless, don't detract from its enjoyment either.  Hello George Lucas, are you getting any of this?<br />Universal has done a masterful job with the transfer of both editions.  Shadow delineation and contrast are superbly rendered.  Colors are well balanced.  The soundtrack has been marvelously restored with John Williams' memorable score jumping out of the speakers in this 5.1 remix.  The extras include a making of documentary and some fluff regarding the reissue.  Candid moments caught by the documentary reveal that neither Henry Thomas or Drew Barrymore looking thrilled to be revisiting the film, perhaps because neither's career reached quite so high after the original theatrical engagement.  Oh, well, this is definitely a nice job by Universal and well worth the wait.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wreathed in the Christmas Spirit"></head><body><p>Playing the lead in the tale of Buddy, a human brought up by Santa's elves, Will Farrell gives a thoroughly engaging, non-ironic performance in this spritely and adorable Christmas movie. Farrell is convincingly sweet and innocent, which is a relief considering how many modern films seem incapable of presenting Christmas without its dark and hypocritical elements. Buddy unabashedly loves Santa and all things Christmas, discovers (through a series of slapstick height-based miscues) that he really isn't an elf. He determines to travel to New York City to meet his real Dad. Predictably, Dad (played with understatement by James Caan) is a businessman with a teeny, tiny heart of stone. Buddy can decorate a room with hand-made Christmas glitz in the blink of an eye. Guess who will change by the end of the film?<br /><br />The last third of the film droops like an underwatered Christmas poinsetta, as the plot requires Farrell to help Santa (Ed Asner) rejuice his sleigh, which has crash landed in Central Park. A few potential gags about the vaucuity of the media are left hanging, and the ending relies a bit too heavily on the movie clich&eacute; of cynical, seen-it-all New Yorker. Nevertheless, "Elf" was fun to watch, had un uplifting message about the Christmas spirit, and just might become a Christmas classics.</p></body></html>

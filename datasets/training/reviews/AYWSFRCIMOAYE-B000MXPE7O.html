<meta name="summary" content="It might be a good shepherd but i's a bad movie without any entertaining value at all."></head><body><p>The film is long, heavy and boring. For almost three hours, all the characters did was talking,<br /><br />talking and talking again. From what I know, movie came from the word "move". So, if all the actors and<br /><br />and actresses just moved their lips the whole time, it should be called a "play" not a movie!<br /><br />To understand the tension, and hardship of a spy, it's better to read a non-fiction book written by a real<br /><br />spy such as "Spy Catcher" by Peter Wright. A book can describe pyschological and non-material matters<br /><br />deeper than a movie.</p></body></html>

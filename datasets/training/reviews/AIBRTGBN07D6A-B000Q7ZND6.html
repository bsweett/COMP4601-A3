<meta name="summary" content="This movie was pretty bad"></head><body><p>I've never read Hellblazer before, but I am a comic fan and thought maybe I'd enjoy this movie. I was wrong.  This movie had some of the worst acting I've seen, especially by Keanu Reeves and Shia LaBeouf.  Aside from that, it contained a storyline that was just too much for a 2 hour movie.  It's obvious that Constantine's life is more complicated than can fit in their time slot, so it appears they left many things out and tried to pack in as much action as possible without explaining very much.<br /><br />Overall, the storyline was incredibly boring, and despite some decent special effects, the action was even more yawn-inducing. This is the first movie in my entire life I've ever fallen asleep in.</p></body></html>

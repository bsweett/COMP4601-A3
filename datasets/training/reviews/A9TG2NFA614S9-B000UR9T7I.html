<meta name="summary" content="Toby, Get Rid of that Smirk!"></head><body><p>In Spiderman 3 Toby Maguire wears his nerdy, simpy, goofy look. The New York Times (11/1/08) refers to him as "a bespectacled nebbish who has been bitten by a radioactive spider." Along with that screwy appearance, he has an enormous ego which his girlfriend Kirsten Dunst finds extremely annoying. His Spiderman persona has made him insufferable because he's so stuck on himself. Kirsten is annoyed because she is trying to make it on Broadway, and she needs a boost. She gets the boot from her show, and he is unaware of it and continues to see himself as the publicly acclaimed super hero.<br /> Later in the movie he is taken over by some meteoric black sticky goo which makes his costume black, gives him extra strength, a lot of sex appeal, and an evil streak. For a time, he's a villain, but the movie already has three other villains to keep the audience busy. Nome of them are evil in the way that the Joker is in the new Batman (2008).<br /> Twice in the movie Spiderman villains seemed to have been dispatched forever, but to my dismay, the villains come back to haunt me, Spiderman and the audience for additional mayhem.<br /> There are three super-villains in this movie: the Sandman, Venom, and the new Goblin. All three of them seem to have good streaks in them as well. The Sandman didn't mean to kill Toby's uncle, and he loves his little daughter. William Dafoe makes a cameo appearance as the father of semi-villain Harry Osborne.<br /> Naturally there's a lot of action with vehicles being tossed around like toothpicks. No deaths of innocents are shown, but how scores escaped death is beyond me.<br /> There are a lot of yuks and campy spots in this movie. Toby Maguire seems ill-suited as the civilian component of a superhero because he's so gawky and dorky. Its comic book origins are kept intact.</p></body></html>

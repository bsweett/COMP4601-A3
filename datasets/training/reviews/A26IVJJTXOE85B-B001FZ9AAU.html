Not only does it take the idea of a superhero into new territory, but it also manages to throw in everything lovable about the new found genre. Most of this movie's heart and charm is owed to Robert Downey Jr., who completely ownes the character in every way possible. The reason Iron Man has become a household name so suddenly is because it was acted so well and made as realistic as possible. It also takes the best parts of the source material and makes it into something familiar, but also new (much like Batman Begins). John Favreau managed to get down the comedy without making the movie become one. When this wants to be, it is a fantastic action movie with lots of great explosions and special effects. However, this also knows how to invest time in its characters and plot so we care about what will happen. The attention to detail is incredible.</p></body></html>

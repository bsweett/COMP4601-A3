<meta name="summary" content="We All Go A Little Crazy Sometimes"></head><body><p>This is one of those classic movies you just wish you could have watched when it first came out in the movie theaters and you or no one else in the audience knew what was coming!  Even if you know the basic story outline complete with the big "surprise" and have seen some of the many parodies and copies of the film the original PSYCHO is a very enjoyable viewing experience for any horror/suspense fan.  From the memorable music to the perfect casting PSYCHO is truly a masterpiece.</p></body></html>

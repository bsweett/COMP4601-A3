<meta name="summary" content="Funny, but I was expecting more"></head><body><p>Wedding Crashers is another in the line of adolescent comedy that seems so popular nowadays. There are some funny scenes, and Will Farrell has a great cameo. However, with Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, I was expecting to be laughing out loud a lot more, and I wasn't. By the end of the film, it seems more like a shallow love story than a comedy film. Good for some laughs, but these actors have done better films.</p></body></html>

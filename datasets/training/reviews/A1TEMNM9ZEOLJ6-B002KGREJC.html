I doubt it - but this movie really entertains, despite it's soap-opera plot about a teen preggers and the yuppie couple that wants the baby. I was mesmerized. The soundtrack is a bit precious, but still likeable in the end. You'll foresee the outcome from the first 5 minutes, but this isn't a suspense tale. It's meant to say something about the human condition, and it succeeds.</p></body></html>

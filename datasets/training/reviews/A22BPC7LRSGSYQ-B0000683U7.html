<meta name="summary" content="One of the greats from Hitchcock's prime"></head><body><p>I just want to give my thoughts on this movie...<br /><br />I would rank North By Northwest (1959) as one of the great movies from Alfred Hitchcock's prime, which, in my opinion, was the period from 1954-1964.  This movie was sandwiched between two of his greatest movies, Vertigo (1958) and Psycho (1960).  Basically the plot involves an innocent man who is chased from New York to Chicago to Mount Rushmore in South Dakota by agents who want to stop the man's interference in their plans to smuggle microfilm that contains government secrets.  It's a case of mistaken identity.  He's abducted, chased by these agents, and framed for murder.  Cary Grant gives a great performance in the role of Roger Thornhill, the innocent man being mistaken for somebody else.  James Mason plays the villain Phillip Vandamm, one of the agents in pursuit of Thornhill.  Mason was always great playing villains (think Salem's Lot 1979).<br /><br />Hitchcock always liked to use good looking blonde women in his movies.  Think of Grace Kelly, Kim Novak, 'Tippi' Hedren, etc.  Eva Marie Saint fits this mold perfectly.  Her acting and screen presence are good in the role of Eve Kendall, a counterspy who is working with the agents, but assists Thornhill by hiding him in her cabin on a train heading for Chicago.  That's all I want to say.  Watch to find out what happens.<br /><br />The opening credit sequence is a classic.  The musical score by Bernard Herrmann is excellent and matches up well with the action on the screen.  The movie has a lot of action.  Some of the scenes have become iconic through the years.  The movie of course has a lot of suspense (as you would expect from Hitchcock).  The DVD's clarity is excellent.  Disc 2 contains over three hours of extras, including documentaries on Cary Grant, Alfred Hitchcock, the movie's iconic status, and the making of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the best Hitchcock movies ever and I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

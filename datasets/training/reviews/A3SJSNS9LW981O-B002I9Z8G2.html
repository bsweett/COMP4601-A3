<meta name="summary" content="Probably the best of the Next Gen.Movies..."></head><body><p>After all, with the Borg, how can you go wrong?<br /><br />The ILM effects are terrific, the performances by James Cromwell, Alice Krige (sp?) and Alfie Woodard are top notch .<br /><br />The best things about this film is Picard trying to control his lust for revenge, and Data being tempted by the human flesh he is given by the Borg queen!<br /><br />The plot is unique, and the action is varied.<br /><br />Alas, there are some problems...<br /><br />The early starship battle scene is too short, and the destruction of the Borg cube is too easy!!<br /><br />Some of the humor falls on it's face... like when Picard and Data are touching the starship "Pheonix," Troi asks them if the "three of  them" would "like to be alone."  later on, Troi plays intoxicated well, but it just ends up being silly. And Picard's line "rumors of my assimilation have been greatly exagerated..." made me groan out loud.<br /><br />And finally, the Borg Queen is too human like! Her behavior is emotional and tempermental. The scariest thing about the Borg as a race is their dispassionate, cold and mechanical motivations... and here their leader acts like some reject from "Desperate Housewives."<br /><br />And the "time travel" plot has a hole. If the Borg can time travel at the push of a button, why don't they try to assimilate Earth in the past... over, and over, and over again? With that type of power, the entire Universe should be "assimilated."<br /><br />Despite these problems, this film is the most consistent of the Next Gen films and is thoroughly enjoyable!<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel "the Shroud of Torrington."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Somewhat superior horror movie"></head><body><p>The plot of the film is reasonably well known. A deadly virus is released accidently by some enviromental actavists. Its effect is to turn those infected into mindless killers. <p>The film opens with a person in hospital waking to find that there is no one around. He wanders around an empty London before being attacked by some of the infected and then he is rescued by some other survivors. A radio message leads them to travel north to an Army facility and more problems emerge. <p>The strength of the film is its atmosphere and its characters. A large number of American films have characters who are sterotypical. Handsome heroes, stoic love interests played by models who are clearly around 19 years of age with big brests. <p>In this case the main characters are in no way Bruce Willis characters. The hero is a courier and one of the other main characters a taxi driver. The women are anything but shrinking violets. The main female lead in fact is tougher than any of the male characters. <p>The DVD is quite interesting. It has a number of alternate endings which reflect different approaches. The end chosen for the film is a happy ending. The alternate endings are somewhat bleaker. There are also a number of deleted scences in which there is commentary by the director. All of it is interesting and explains the process of film making in a practical way.<p>In conclusion a superior film of the genre and a DVD which is worth a look</p></body></html>

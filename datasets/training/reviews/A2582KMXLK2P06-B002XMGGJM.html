I had the opportunity to watch it back in January but I kept putting it off until this afternoon.  What a terrible decision on my part!  Law Abiding Citizen is awesome.<br /><br />A man (Gerard Butler's character) answers the door one night and a robber breaks in.  He then ties up Gerard Butler and kills his daughter and wife.  Later, when the robber/murderer is correctly identified, Jamie Foxx (playing the role of a lawyer) allows the bad guy to go free.  This of course, hurts Gerard Butler's feelings; watching the man who murdered his family walk free with no punishment whatsoever.  So what does he do?<br /><br />He gets revenge 10 years later.  Of course he doesn't call it revenge, but whatever.  Without spoiling too much, Gerard Butler eventually finds the man who murdered his family and tortures the living *heck* out of him.  Now the way the torture segment takes place requires viewers to suspend disbelief because it's almost impossible for all the events to fall into place correctly to allow everything concerning the bad guy to go as planned.  I'm of course referring to a certain phone call that encourages the bad guy to run along the rooftops of the buildings and assume he's being led to safety.  This entire segment is hard to believe and you'll know exactly what I mean when you watch the movie.  I don't want to say exactly how everything falls into place, but yeah- you already know it's a movie and not reality anyway.  At least I HOPE so. :)<br /><br />It doesn't end there either.  While locked up in jail, Gerard Butler messes with Jamie Foxx's character by telling him how he's going to be prosecuted.  At first it seems like the character of Gerald Butler is absolutely crazy the way he's able to dictate his own fate, so to speak.  Soon, it's revealed he has an accomplice.  At least I *think* so.  I don't recall actually seeing him.  I just LOVE the way Gerard Butler is able to completely take over the entire FBI, the police department and everybody else, and continue his little rampage of violence all the while being locked up in jail!<br /><br />Anyway, it's important to note that once Gerard Butler is arrested for torturing the man who murdered his family, the movie does NOT turn into a typical lawyer film.  This is most certainly a suspense/action packed movie the way Gerard Butler continues to take out his anger on those who may have been even SLIGHTLY in any way, shape or form connected to his family's murder.  Yes we're dealing with a lunatic here, haha.<br /><br />Overall, I loved it.  Nonstop excitement is in store for you, I can promise you that.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A GOOD HISTORICAL PIECE."></head><body><p>While it's not on par with his last two directorial efforts (the epic "Braveheart" and the soul-stirring "The Passion of the Christ"), Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" is a well-made historical film set during the final days of the Mayan empire. The cast and crew do a fine job of bringing the world of the Mayan to life. While the second act of the film gets long after a while, the final hour of the movie is rousing and exciting. And the unexpected ending will leave everyone wide-eyed. Fans of Gibson's previous work will enjoy "Apocalypto."<br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hotel Rwanda"></head><body><p>If you can watch this movie and feel nothing at all, you are dead. It'll engage you like nothing, or almost nothing, you've ever seen. And that's the verdict of Michael the Uber-Cynic, so what more do you need?<br /><br />It's a sad world we live in. We hear the word "genocide" so many times that we don't even feel it. We see so many civil wars that we don't even care. I knew Rwanda had made the news, but that was about it. I ignored headlines and skipped to the comics and the sports page. Another month, another civil war, another genocide, another geography lesson, and I finally quit listening. I thickened my crusty old shell and concentrated on making mo money. But I know now what happened in Rwanda back then, and I'm glad that I know. It does matter. I've never been to Africa, and about 99% of my readers have never been to Africa, but it still matters.<br /><br />Don Cheadle, who I admired in the days of PICKET FENCES, gave a powerful performance in the true story of Paul Rusesabagina's struggle and his heroism. This film won all kinds of awards, and I can see why. But that's not important. What it did, for me, was put a human face on what happened. It's a powerful story told well, with real people living through a seemingly unreal situation.<br /><br />I find this tidbit interesting, and it pleases me greatly. The writer always had Don Cheadle in mind. The financiers suggested Denzel Washington, Wesley Snipes, etc etc. And you know I love Denzel. But Don Cheadle made this role his own. I can't picture anybody else as Paul Rusesabagina. Probably not even the real Paul Rusesabagina if I met him. Sometimes it's like that. It doesn't have to make sense.<br /><br />I strongly suggest that everyone watch this film. I don't think it could be any better than it is. Excellent writing, supremely talented cast, superb direction. It's an instant classic, folks. I know I'll watch it a few more times, and if my version had English subtitles I'd be tempted to take it into a classroom.</p></body></html>

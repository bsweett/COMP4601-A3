<meta name="summary" content="Tough Love in 'Spotless Mind' !"></head><body><p>Although deliberately disorienting, this psychological drama with some science fiction elements seems to wrap up rather well, but it's an emotional rollercoaster ride for the viewer!<br /><br />But to connect the dots of this love story takes a lot of work for the audience/viewer to sort out.  Reminds me strongly of elements from Chris Nolan's Memento in form and substance to a large degree.  Joel Barrish is played by Jim Carrey in a dramatic, intensely emotional role and Kate Winslett plays Clementine, a wilful, brutally honest woman with an impulsive mind of her own.<br /><br />The story actually has a backdrop regarding a company called Lacuna, which specializes in wiping memories of those we've missed and rather than deal with the pain, we would rather forget about it.  Unfortunately trying to forget instead of deal with it is not so easy.<br /><br />Thus the good doctor that runs Lacuna runs a very brisk business.  People want to forget Fido or forget their dead husbands and wives, their broken hearts.  The doc and his employees are a pretty irresponsible, unethical bunch.<br /><br />The doctor himself uses the memory erasing techniques to wipe out his receptionist's affair with him.  Damn!  And Patrick, another assistant, uses Joel's memories to pick up on the girl Joel is erasing.  Stealing the files, Patrick's plan seems to work out OK for some time.  This part of the story was never resolved for me, since Patrick never was caught or punished for this clear doctor patient violation.<br /><br />Trying not to get too "into" the subplots, Joel overall seemed a good guy in this film but a bit addled and frightened by the memory erasure procedure, especially after he found out that his girl did the same thing.<br /><br />The special effects were well done and subdued -- memories erase, and Clementine and Joel hide in memories to prevent the erasing.<br /><br />The overall film, though very original and at times endearing and charming, did not hold my interest to a great degree.  Even so, Kate Winslett got an Academy Award nomination for best actress in 2004 for this film.<br /><br />Jim Carrey in a dramatic role never appealed to me, so I must protest the casting.<br /><br />What if you could erase memories of those you've loved and lost?  And could you trust a company that would do that for you not to go all unethical and irresponsible on you, and take advantage of your trust?<br /><br />Frightening concept.<br /><br />It is available as a one-disc Widescreen Collector's Edition worldwide.

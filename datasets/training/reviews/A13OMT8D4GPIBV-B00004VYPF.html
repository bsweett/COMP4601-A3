No, it's not an intellectual deep thinking man's movie.  No it isn't one known for the breathtaking camera angles and visuals, and no it doesn't have a plot that's so rich that you're bound to lose focuse halfway through.  It has heart, and that makes up for it.<br /><br />It's one of the most perfectly executed, and brilliantly scripted movies of all time.  It's fun, exciting, and the perfect family movie.  It doesn't try to be something it's not.  I could go on and on about what makes this movie great but I'm going to stop and actually spend some time reviewing the movie.<br /><br />As silent films are fading and being replaced by talkies (films with sound) two silent actors struggle to find their way in the ever chaging world of Hollywood.  Without going too deep into the plot I do have to say that this movie is one that people may see as overrated simply because every magazine or poll ranks it in the Top 10 greatest list.  Coupled with the fact that 70% of fans love it I don't see how it's overrated.<br /><br />The DVD is a definite must have.  A commentary featuring every person who was alive at that time that worked on the movie.  PLenty of featurettes and even an outtake from the film.  This is a definite must have.<br /><br />Definitely Must Have.</p></body></html>

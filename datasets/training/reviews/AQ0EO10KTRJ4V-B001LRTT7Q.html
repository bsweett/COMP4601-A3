<meta name="summary" content="As good as this type of film gets"></head><body><p>When compared to the majority of films being released these days, HOSTAGE is about as good as it gets making this type of film...<br /><br />Classic good honest cop thrown into a tough situation while trying to escape the burnout of a prior life is faced with some of society's worst criminals and human scum !<br /><br />Bruce Willis does some of his best dramatic emotional acting in this tense hostage thriller.<br /><br />Soundtrack helps build the moods and tensions.<br /><br />This is not the mindless "cotton candy" formula fluff liberal Hollywood tends to toss out these days.. this is a real story with real world grit.<br /><br />Sure there are some minor elements I may not have been 100% thrilled with regarding the kid's pat of the storyline, but no film can be 100% perfect in every regard for every viewer.<br /><br />Like I said, this is about as good as it gets when making this type of film.<br /><br />It's a shame it got such little attention when other lesser films are better known.</p></body></html>

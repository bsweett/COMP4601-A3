Fails like: when the last bullet in the gun is not the last; when storm passes by too fast; when a host that was attacked by a facehugger dies too fast (like seconds after waking up); when the main actress doesn't even shiver standing there on arctic circle doing nothing with only a shirt on; when predators use cloak they have to press at least some buttons, it doesn't happen on it's own. I didn't like the main actress, how she behaves and the destiny of Michael Bishop. Predators looked okay and behaved too much like humans. Despite that, I enjoyed this filled with action movie. It's okay, not bad.</p></body></html>

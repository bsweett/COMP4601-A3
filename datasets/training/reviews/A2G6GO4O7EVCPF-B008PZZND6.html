<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good movie with great performances by the 2 leads"></head><body><p>Brokeback Mountain is of course the movie about Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, 2 cowboys who spend one summer up on Brokeback Mountain together with the sheep. Along the way they make love to one another in which case Ennis says he isnt that way. They dont want anyone else to know about it so they keep it a secret. Ennis' wife Alma Del Mar is played by the wonderful Michelle Williams (The Baxter, Dawson's Creek). They have a daughter as well. Jack falls in love with rodeo girl Lureen Newsome played by cutie Anne Hathaway (Havoc, Princess Diaries 1 & 2). They have a son together. Jack gets in contact with Ennis and the two of them spend time fishing which is what they do but also their love for each other grows. Alma right away discovers the secret hiding and bottling it up inside of her all throughout. I ignore the bad reviews and snippy remarks and the jokes and just watch the movie and I thought it was pretty good for what it is. Heath Leger (Lords of Dogtown, Casanova) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko, Jarhead) give superb performances. The scene in which Gyllenhaal yells at his step-father to sit down was a great scene...I was waiting for Gyllenhaal to deck that guy. I had to put subtitles on half way for Ledger because some times he'd talk real low and I couldnt understand what he said but I got it all. Do I think it was snubbed at Oscar time? Uh, it was but I did liked Crash. The cinematography is great. Also starring Randy Quaid (The Ice Harvest, Independence Day), Anna Faris (Scary Movie 1-4 million, Just Friends), Linda Cardellini (Scooby-Doo 1&2, Grandma's Boy) and Graham Beckel (Blue Streak, Black Dog).</p></body></html>

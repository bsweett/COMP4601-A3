The author is a Hungarian born, Canadian writer.<br /><br />Out of 14 books he has written, Vengeance is the story of an Israeli operation to assassinate the terrorists responsible for the massacre that took place during the 1972 Olympic games.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg directs the film and the DVD provides a rare interview in which Mr. Spielberg discusses that his movie is not anti-Israel and or pro-Palestinian. This got me curious... and as I researched the background, the interview is intended to dispel the protests of the author, who complained that Munich was a distorted interpretation of his original work.<br /><br />In essence, Jonas said that scriptwriter Tony Kushner, a Jew who has referred to the formation of Israel as a mistake, failed to make a moral distinction between terrorism and legitimate military action.<br /><br />Critics of the book said that Jonas's source for the book; New York security consultant Jubal Aviv had fabricated the story. Reading all these details got us rather curious about the film, which we obtained and finally watched.<br /><br />The production is a thrilling recount of details that were unknown to us. The revenge plot puts forward the fact that when we set out to pay back for sins of the past, innocent people sometimes pay the price. The movie therefore, delves into complex issues of guilt, violence, murder, love, family... honor, and the defense of the right of the people of Israel to have a place they can call home.<br /><br />The reliving of the events that lead and transpired during the kidnapping and murder of the athletes is... horrifying to say the least. Golda Meir is represented in this movie and she has a monologue where she weighs the actions and consequences of what they are about to do that is simply priceless soul-searching view of what any leader must go through as they guide a people or a nation towards survival.<br /><br />The technology used to eliminate those responsible is interesting, the methods are at times careless and dangerous, the people that reveal the whereabouts of those to be killed are interesting, but mercenary and it is with great horror that we realize they provide information to both sides... at a high price, of course, gaining great wealth from all the violence that ensues.<br /><br />From beginning to end, we found ourselves riveted on the screen, learning a lot and feeling that hindsight provides 20-20 vision on rather complex issues that while we are living them... leaves us all blind due to lack of total awareness of the powers at play. Don't miss it!</p></body></html>

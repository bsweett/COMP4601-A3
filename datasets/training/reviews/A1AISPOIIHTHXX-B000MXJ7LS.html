<meta name="summary" content="4.5; effective film that just falls a couple ways from greatness"></head><body><p>Oliver Stone, known for his wild conspiracy-laden film JFK, the ultra-violent Natural Born Killers or Vietnam centered Platoon, directs this film and unless you took off the credits and everything, you probably couldn't tell he did this. No shift from color to black and white, no hyper camera or politics. So don't think this film is meant to be a big rant against terrorists, or even America for its politics or, I must admit they show sometimes, their arrogance. Instead what we get is just simply a first-hand account of 2 caught in the rubble, as well as the families that were on pins and needles waiting by a phone.<br /><br />September 11, 2001, a day like any other like the opening scenes show us. 2 cops, John McCoughlin and Will Jimenez go to work only to hear of a plane hitting one of the towers at the World Trade Center. In they go, as well as other officers, to rescue those trapped in the buildings until both towers collapse. Miraculously they survive but are trapped and severely injured. We follow both men struggling to live out of sight and unable to move. We also switch to their wives, John's wife Donna and Will's wife Allison as they wait impatiently for news on their husbands.<br /><br />One commonly asked question at the time, and even a song title by Alan Jackson, was "where were you?" Me, I was in Math class until I had a spare at 10:30 that took me right to lunch. As I was walking to the stairway to go downstairs and out the door, I heard one student say they "bombed the Pentagon" but I thought crazy kids always talking about movie plots or just being weird. It wasn't until I looked on a website at home that it was the top story. Turned on the TV and there it was. One thing I hated was the TV coverage. Seeing each plane slam into one of the towers every 7 seconds from different angles was a bit much: over 100 lives on each plane not to mention those in the vicinity of where they hit gone in a few seconds. Then of course we have the collapse which they replayed again. Thankfully this film doesn't show them from a filmmaking perspective, putting them on news report or sounds. Oddly the highlight even though it sounds morbid is when they towers collapse with the officers inside: it's incredibly harrowing and powerful really even if it doesn't last as long as I would like. The film suffers from a Catch-22 though: switching back and forth from the families to the 2 officers is a bit jarring even though both would work fine on their own. Seeing 2 cops who can't move talk to each other for an hour and a half would've been kind of boring but when they switch, it's like "hey put it back!"<br /><br />One thing that happened a lot before the film came out was people asking whether it was too soon to make this. Oddly, this is the 4th film I can recall about 9/11 specifically: Flight 93, United 93, the Great New Wonderful and this film. It doesn't really feel early for me. Instead it feels like a film that was doomed by the public before it even premiered(didn't help that star Maggie Gylennhaal made a comment about America and 9/11 that America was in a way responsible. This of course was highly offensive to them, especially New Yorkers but it does feel like what the film's reaction was too: mention 9/11 and a shield is set up, preventing anyone from talking about it in any way. Stone manages to for once be non-political and presents a simple straight-forward story.<br /><br />Recently I bought the extended edition of King Kong, the third release to feature extensive background info on the making of the film, the other 2 being the original 2-disc as well as the Production Diaries set. While the film was rather lackluster, the amount of attention paid to the making-of suggests that they obviously loved making the film, just to bad the finished product wasn't as well as it should've been. Same thing with the Some Kind of Monster documentary, chronicling Metallica's recording of the much-maligned St. Anger album. It's not that World Trade Center is bad, far from it, but what this film could've been and seeing the special features makes it clear this film could've been incredibly moving.<br /><br />It's a film that I admire but I find it hard to love. That said, this is not a cinema blemish and it's at times a very effective film.</p></body></html>

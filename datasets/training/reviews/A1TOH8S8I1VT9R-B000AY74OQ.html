CG nolonger carries the day."></head><body><p>As a big fan of special effects and animation in general, I must say that we're hitting a "dry Patch".  We went through this in the middle 90's when everyone was making feature length 2d animated features.  The thinking of the day was; "Disney's making bushels of cash with them, so should we!"  Not bad thinking, but un-original.  We simpley O.D.ed on Disney-style animation.  A great art form, but too much.<br /><br />Of course, there was this little thing called "Toy Story" that came along and really changed everything.  And we got many great CG animated films such as all the Pixar films, Shrek, Ice Age (shrek Jr.), Antz and even Jimmy Neutron.  Unfortunately, now all the participating studios have forgotten past lessons.  But there is a difference this time.  This time, corporate greed has exceeded it's quota.  These CG films are so filled with trendy music, product placements, and so-so actors that they are losing the one element that makes great film;  STORY.  And though the films still make money, they nolonger feel "special".  Soon enough, they will nolonger make money either.<br /><br />Here's some things that make "Madagascar" no better than 3 stars in my mind:<br /><br />-All of the voice actors are very trending and(to me)extremely annoying.  Ironically, the no-name voices are the entertaining ones.<br /><br />-I consider The yellow bar on the DVD case that says "#1 family film of the year" as a warning that when translated reads; "Bare-bones DVD inside.  Forced promotional spots included".  (See Shrek2).<br /><br />-"The Incredibles" (the last really good CG film) has everything "Madagascar" does not; Great stroy, great characters, great imagery and not the least bit trendy.<br /><br />-Madagascar is so heavy with trendy, sales oriented gimicks that it will become dated very quickly.  Not as bad as "Shark tale" but trendy none-the-less.<br /><br />-Caracter development is thin.  Each character has their gimmicky "thing" but it does not help you like or care about them.<br /><br />-The penguin side story (voiced by animators)is actually more funny and entertaining than the "lead" characters' story line.  Their arival "home" is a classic "cartoon" moment.<br /><br />-Chris Rock, David Schwimmmer, Ben Stiller...  ... I can't think of three, more annoying actors.  Stiller, as a voice, is non-descript.<br /><br />-Kids do enjoy this movie, but they like "Shark Boy and Lava Girl" too.<br /><br />-Lemers epitomise this whole story; Self-serving, annoying, loud, obnoxiuos, gimmick-laden and cheeky.  The little song they sing is kind of ammusing though.<br /><br />-The style of the characters was actually pretty cool.  A very cartoony, exagurated look.<br /><br />-My wife and I left the theater basically unaffected.  Can you think of a worse thing to say about any film?<br /><br />-I Think I would have enjoyed the film much more if the animals never talked.  There were enough "cute" moments to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />After all this, I ask myself (you may have wondered too) "how on earth did I give it 3 start instead of 1?".  I guess it is because I really do enjoy animation on all levels.  A lot of artists put a lot of themselves into this production.  I guess I'm dissapointed in the overall feal of the film.  CG is nolonger a guarantee that a film will be entertaining (let alone good).  If more productions like "Madagascar" get made, people will stop flocking to the theater just because a film is produced in 3d CG. As Syndrome said in "The Incredibles"; "When everyone's super, Then no one will be".</p></body></html>

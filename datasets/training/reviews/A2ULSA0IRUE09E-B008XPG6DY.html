<meta name="summary" content="Jennifer Aniston Sinks this Ship"></head><body><p>Anything that Jennifer Aniston is in turns out to be a catastrophe of the most evil proportions. No, this is not a criticism, just a plain fact. Nowhere is this more true than in "Derailed", a film of such obvious plotholes and `shocks', that its almost unbearable to watch it hurtle towards its' predictable ending.<br /><br />Before I elaborate, please note that this film has no re-watchability factor at ALL. Sitting through this once was a pain enough, but I can't imagine anyone subjecting them to repeat viewings of this travesty.<br /><br />The good - Clive Owen is fantastic in a very poorly written role as a husband who wants to cheat on his wife with a stranger he meets on the train. Vincent Cassel is passably average as the villain of the piece - a `French' sounding person who insists on using clich&eacute;s and more clich&eacute;s to harass Owen and his pretty family (all of whom are blond in the most blatantly Aryan way imaginable)<br /><br />The bad - Jennifer Aniston. Need I elaborate? This woman can sink a ship simply by phoning in her existence. Never has the aging tart looked or sounded more pathetic, and her entire appearance is only what I can call `doggish'. They even give her some lines. Imagine that. She plays a woman on a train whose job it is to seduce unsuspecting men by taking them to hotel rooms, and then getting her boyfriend (Cassel) to torment them. She is the actual villain in this sordid Bollywood saga, and here she portrays a woman who is molested (though she actually isn't). Tedious.<br /><br />The Ugly - Jennifer Aniston. Nuff said.<br /><br />Final Views - This is not so much a movie as it is a trainwreck (the `Derailed' title makes sense in more ways than one). Many say that the plot is `absurd', but I just think its `unbelievably bad'. That said, the `happy ending' wasn't that much of an ending - everyone pretty much dies, though the more intelligent ones among us might actually take pleasure of the scenes where Aniston bleeds herself to a bloody, slow death after being accidentally shot. And then you remember its just a movie.<br /><br />Avoid at all cost. For a far better film, watch Angelina Jolie in "Beyond Borders". Now THAT'S how its done Jennifer.<br /><br />Two Stars for Clive Owen though - the man shines even in a heap of dung.</p></body></html>

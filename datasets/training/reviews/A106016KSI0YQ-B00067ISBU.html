This is a popcorn movie that carries the real strength of its own convictions, and as such its really a pleasure to watch. The whole thing is a mix of Jack Kirby monster comics, Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos, and (particularly) the Indiana Jones films, particularly in the use of Nazis and the occult, and its peculiar zest for pop culture is part of what makes the whole thing so much fun. It also seems very similar to the beloved TV series BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER in its vision of the heartaches of adolescence seen as a kind of literal hell, although her the misfit teenagers don't just fight monsters but ARE themselves monsters too: Hellboy himself (definitively played by Ron Perlman) has a gigantic body and a surface cynicism and contempt for authority, but deep down he's simply a big boy trying to fit in and at the mercy of his emotional vulnerability. He may file down his horns, but he can't help wearing his heart on his sleeve.<br /><br />The film's villains are spectacularly loathsome, with a clockwork Nazi assassin wearing a gas-mask clearly del Toro's favorite character in the film; he is killed and re-born perhaps too many times for the viewer to care much by the time he is finally (?) destroyed. Indeed, the film's greatest trouble is that it seems to keep concluding over and over again, which gets to be a little wearing. It is also a bit loud and jumbled at the end: it's best sequences by far are in the first third, when del Toro allows a sense of childlike wonder to dominate as we are introduced to the beautiful interiors that are always the hallmark of his films. There's also a wonderful character named Abe who is a delicate merman of enhanced psychic abilities; he is voiced by David Hyde Pierce but physically acted by the great Doug Jones, who makes the character's movements a real thing of beauty and amazement. (When he gets shunted aside by all the monsters at the end you greatly miss his presence.) This twin DVD set is filled with every sort of background story of both the film and its characters you could imagine, and should be a real treat for all Hellboy fanboys and fangirls.</p></body></html>

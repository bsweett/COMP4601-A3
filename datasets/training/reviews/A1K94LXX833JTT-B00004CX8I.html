<meta name="summary" content="Great film comes to Blu-ray July 15th, 2008, DVD details and movie review"></head><body><p>This film profoundly moved me when I finally saw it, long after its 1975 release (while working at a place I won't name that reminded me a little too much of the institution in the film!).  It burns with the intensity of human struggle against oppression, showing how strong, how fragile, and how precious the spark of freedom and dignity is even in what might seem the most unlikely place for it, a mental institution.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson, who won a well deserved Oscar for the role, plays a convict of mixed character who thinks he can game the system but gets in over his head.  His erratic behavior has gotten him transfered from a prison work farm to a mental hospital, which he appears to see as an easier place to serve his time.  Initially careless and arrogant in his dealing with both staff and patients, he comes to care about his fellow inmates, some there voluntarily.  Partly on their behalf he becomes locked into a battle of wills with the domineering, cold Nurse Ratched, who effectively controls the hospital (Louise Fletcher, who also won an Oscar for her role).  While much of the film plays as comedy, the overall frame is that of tragedy mixed with ambiguous victory.  It's easy to see political/social/philosophical context and implications, worth reflecting on, but the basic humanity of the story is central.<br /><br />Besides the Academy Awards for Best Actor and Best Actress, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Direction (Milos Forman), and Best Adapted Screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman, from the novel by Ken Kesey).<br /><br />The new Blu-ray DVD will carry the same special features as the SD Special Edition:<br /><br />-- audio commentary with director Milos Forman and producers Michael Douglas and Saul Zaentz<br />-- "The Making of One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest" documentary (47 minutes)<br />-- additional footage: McMurphy and Dr. Spivey, Chief Captured between Mops, Shaving Chief, Who's the Top Loony Here?, McMurphy Meets Nurse Ratched, First Group Therapy Session, A Bunch a Chickens at a Pecking Party, Mr. McMurphy, Where Are Your Clothes?<br />-- theatrical trailer<br /><br />Specs: 1.85:1 Widescreen 1080p Hi-Def, English Dolby Digital 5.1, French 1.0, Spanish 1.0, German 1.0, Italian 1.0, subtitles in English, Spanish, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Portuguese, Swedish.  Extras are in standard definition.<br /><br />Hi def is always nice, but this isn't a film that requires high definition to be fully enjoyed, I think, and the SD Special Edition has good video and sound, so if you already have the Special Edition or can get it more cheaply than the Blu-ray, you might like it just about as well.<br /><br />By the way, this film is often compared to Cool Hand Luke, which has some similar themes.  That's also coming out on Blu-ray, though not till September.  The Amazon page for it's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017TYPIG">here</a>.</p></body></html>

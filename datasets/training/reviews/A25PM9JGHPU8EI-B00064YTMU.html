<meta name="summary" content="There IS A COMMENTARY TRACK!"></head><body><p>Contrary to Amazon's review, there IS a full-length, scene-specific commentary track. Strangely, it is listed nowhere on the packaging. The only way I found out about it was by clicking Audio Options on disc 1, and there you will see the available commentary by Michael Mann, which is dry but informative. Very strange not to promote it - what, are these now going to be like "easter eggs"?? I admit I was pleasantly surprised to find it. The cinematography is sublime, with terrific blues and greens. I've usually disliked any attempt to shoot features on video, but it is employed to perfection here capturing the cab interior and nighttime cityscape of LA beautifully. It is the best example of the format I've ever seen, so it makes me hopeful that future productions (and technology) will get ever closer to the quality of film stock. It is great to see Cruise play evil, maybe his best performace since TJ Mackey in Magnolia. Foxx of course is a total pro. Jada looks utterly gorgeous. I had some problems with the story as it strains plausibility in MANY scenes, but it's a trade-off made acceptable by superb production values.</p></body></html>

Cameron Diaz looks so out of place in this film and that horrible accent she tries to pull off, jeez she belongs in a romantic comedy! There's no doubt Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis are gifts to the acting world but even these talented guys can't save this slow, boring train wreck. If you want a great Scorsese film then see Raging Bull.</p></body></html>

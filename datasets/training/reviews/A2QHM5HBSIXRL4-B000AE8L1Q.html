<meta name="summary" content="A result of the friendship between Joan Allen & Mike Binder"></head><body><p>There's a neat story behind this movie:  Mike Binder and Joan Allen met a few years back when Binder played Allen's Chief of Staff in "The Contender."  Allen knew Binder had writing chops and said, basically, 'Hey, Mike, if you write a good script, keep me in mind.'  Which is what happened here: not only did he keep her in mind, he built the whole movie around her.  And, she delivers the goods.<br /><br />I've always respected Joan Allen's work, but she takes it a few notches higher here with some mind-blowing acting.  And, more than a few guys are going to watch the movie and say: whoo, she's a lot sexier than I ever realized.  And funnier, too.<br /><br />But - don't trust the rather light and airy trailer.  This movie is quite a bit darker than the trailer lets on.  In fact, it starts out with a funeral, then goes back three years and inexorably works towards that event.  You spend the entire movie wondering: whose funeral is it?  The answer is a controversial twist that has divided critics nationwide.  Everyone has an opinion.  In fact, another amazon reviewer (J. A . Crow) has one I read here (scroll down a bit) that made my jaw drop.  I'm not ruling that theory out.  Wow, if that's what Mike Binder designed and hid in this movie and you ferreted that out, sir or madam, my hat's off to you.</p></body></html>

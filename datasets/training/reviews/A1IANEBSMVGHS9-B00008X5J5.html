<meta name="summary" content="An unforgettable story becomes even harder to forget"></head><body><p>The Sleeping Beauty story never gets old, no matter how old you are or how long ago you saw it. But this Platinum Edition brings out the best in the story with a great-looking digitally restored picture, making it now even harder to forget with colors that jump at you. If you can watch the movie on a widescreen TV you will enjoy it at its fullest as it was the first one that Disney did on 70 mm film.<br /><br />Alongside the unforgettable tale, there are lots of extra material packing the two discs, such as children games, a great documentary on the making of the movie and even a short on the life of Tchaikovsky (whose music is featured on the film) that make this package a must have for Disney fans.</p></body></html>

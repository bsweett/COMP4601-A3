<meta name="summary" content="FREDDY VS JASON......WELL! WHAT DO YOU EXPECT WITH A TITLE LIKE THAT?"></head><body><p>This movie has been in limbo for years. This was to be released before 'Jason X', after 'Jason Goes To Hell'. It has it's moments and each franchise has released worse entries under better conditions. I am a fan of both series, but have always thought Jason was more menacing than Freddy!<br /><br />When I first heard they were making this I immediately thought of other classic monster team ups  Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman, King Kong VS Godzilla and Alien VS Predator. I guess compared with the other team up films it stands up pretty well. The DVD edition is way better than the film deserves. A decent installment in both series.</p></body></html>

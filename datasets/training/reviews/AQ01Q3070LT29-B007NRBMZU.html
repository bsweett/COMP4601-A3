When the movie came out, with the help of a good publicist, managers and agent, suddenly the name "Ashton Kutcher" was everywhere on television.  Of course we know him from "The 70's Show" tv series, but everyday on tabloid television we heard about Ashton Kutcher.  Then when we saw him with his girlfriend, well that was the top of the cake.  More publicity.  The only way Kutcher got knocked out of the news was when it was announced (Pardon me for saying this.  This is quite a shock) Chris Rock was going to host the 77th Academy Awards.<br />  After recovering from that, I put off seeing this film and waited months before I finally decided it was time to see it on DVD.  "Additional Scenes" and both versions theatrical and "Director's Cut" on one disc peaked my interest.<br />  Evan (Logan Lerman) has had some real horrifing things happen in his young life so far.  He visits his real father who is in a psycho ward.  The visit starts normal, but suddenly when he opens his eyes, he sees his father trying to ring his neck in full anger.<br />  The neighbor kids are with Evan (John Patrick Amedori).  They want to blow up a mailbox with an explosive.  They wait for the explosion.  When Evan comes to, he someone is in the woods.  Evan has blackouts.  He doesn't know what has just happened. he keeps a diary of his blackouts.  Nobody will tell him what has happened while he is out, so he still doesn't know.  It bothers him.  A solution to the problem, him and his parents move away.<br />  Now in college, Evan (Ashton Kutcher) hasn't had a blackout in seven years.  A date finds his diary and he begins to read it.  Suddenly the horrible memories come back to him.  He now knows how he blacked-out and the lost memories are now returning much to his horror.  He goes back to his old hometown to get answers with some horrifing effects.<br />  This DVD version gives you the chance to see the "theatrical version" or the "Director's Cut" version with a different ending.<br />  "Infinifilm" can be chosen to play during either versions while you watch the film,  deleted scenes, casting, storyboards and alternate scenes.<br />  The theatrical version and ending is better.  Ashton Kutcher is Executive Producer of this film.<br />  Followed by The Butterfly Effect 2 (2006)</p></body></html>

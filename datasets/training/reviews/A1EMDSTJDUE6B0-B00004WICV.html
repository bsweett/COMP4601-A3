<meta name="summary" content="What Happens on the Mile, Stays on the Mile"></head><body><p>This was a surprisingly good movie. I had seen &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; (SR) and many others like it. I preferred &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (TGM) to most of them, including SR. If you liked &quot;Beaches&quot; or &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, give TGM a try.<p>Tom Hanks shines as an actor, as do almost all of the other cast members. What is more impressive is how Hanks works in prison-management skills into the movie. It is a good example to managers in all fields.<p>The movie is long at three hours. However, if it had been cut shorter, it would not have been as effective. This is one of those longer movies that should be three hours (about 90% of the others should be half their length). The movie can easily been seen to the half-way point and picked up later without losing track of the plot.</p></body></html>

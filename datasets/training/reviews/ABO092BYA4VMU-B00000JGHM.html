Al Pacino and Robert De Niro give standout performances, yet the two share so little on screen time together. The action is the best I have ever seen since Die Hard and the Godfather, and the L.A. bank heist Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore pull off is genius and is so well executed that it is one of the greatest action scenes ever put on film.</p></body></html>

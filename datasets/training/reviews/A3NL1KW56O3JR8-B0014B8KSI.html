<meta name="summary" content="Seriously over-rated"></head><body><p>With all the hype about this movie, I was shocked at how disappointing it was. The plot is very far from being original: an evil Monsanto-type company is trying to weasel their way out of liability in a multi-billion lawsuit for knowingly poisioning hundreds of people. (Uh, hello! Ever see "A Civil Action" or "The Constant Gardner" or any of a hundred other movies?)<br /><br />On top of this, the movie is SLOW. Whoever called this a "fast-paced thriller" must either be smoking crack or just be retarded. MC seriously drags.<br /><br />The only saving grace is that Clooney is such a good actor. Without that, this movie would be worthless.<br /><br />Not recommended.</p></body></html>

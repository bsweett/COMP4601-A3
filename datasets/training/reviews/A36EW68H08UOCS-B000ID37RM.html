<meta name="summary" content="One of the greatest Treasures in film"></head><body><p>Harper Lee wrote a semi-autobiographical novel about memories she made growing up in small town Alabama during that time between the Civil War and World War II, when blacks had been emancipated, but many whites, especially in the South, were reluctant to acknowledge blacks as equals.  The setting of this story preceded Martin Luther King, Jr's work by two decades. The novel "To Kill A Mockingbird" is one of the most important, passionate, beloved, spiritual and moral works in the English language.  It rightfully was awarded a Pulitzer Prize, and if only one had been awarded for the entire 20th century, it would still get my vote.<br /><br />Rightfully so, Harper Lee was hesitant to see her beloved story turned over to "Hollywood".  She needn't have worried.<br /><br />"To Kill a Mockingbird", the film, has become as beloved as Harper Lee's book.  When the American Film Institute came out with their many "100 Greatest..." lists at the turn of the century Gregory Peck's performance as Atticus Finch came out at #1 on the list of "Greatest Screen Heroes", ahead of such screen icons as Indiana Jones, James Bond and Rick from "Casablanca".  The film itself ranked as #34 of Greatest Films of history.  I would personally rank it in the top 2.<br /><br />The story is relatively simple.  A black man, Tom Robinson (in a noble performance by Brock Peters) is accused of raping a young woman from a "white trash" family.  The guilt of the black man is a foregone conclusion in this predominantly white southern town, but the Judge knows the only man in town with a chance to defend Tom.  The Judge asks Atticus Finch.  Atticus Finch is a widower, raising his two children on the salary of a small-town southern lawyer, frequently taking livestock and vegetables in trade for his services.  Atticus has many friends in town, and everyone who knows Mr. Finch knows that he is a man of saint-like honor.  Atticus never brags and much of what his own children learn about him comes from other adults who have known him for years.<br /><br />Wisely approaching the movie from the same perspective as Harper Lee's original narrative, Robert Mulligan tells the story from the perspective of the Finch children: Mary Badham as daughter Scout (who seems about 10) and slightly older brother Phillip Alford as Jem.  Scout and Jem do the things that children do.  They play hide and seek.  They tell ghost stories.  They roll tires down the street.  And, most importantly, they watch their father defend an innocent man who is sometimes an inch away from being lynched.<br /><br />The courtroom scenes are taut, with racial conflict simmering away like a pot threatening to boil over at any moment.  Atticus Finch keeps the lid on that pot.  The courtroom scenes here have not been matched by any film before or since.  Gregory Peck confided to Director Mulligan that he had won the Academy Award for him in just the scene at the end of the trial where Atticus silently packs up his papers and walks out of the courtroom.  If you haven't seen the film before - watch for this moment and you'll know what he meant.<br /><br />Supporting performances perfectly compliment the transcendant one by Mr. Peck.  Robert Duvall makes an impressive screen debut in an important role that doesn't appear until the final moments.  Collin Wilcox Paxton captures the pitiful "victim" of the alleged rape, Mayella Ewell.  James Anderson is terrifying as Mayella's spitefully prejudiced father, Bob Ewell.  Estelle Evans plays Calpurnia, who mothers the motherless Finch children when Atticus must be away.  Frank Overton is authoritative and one of the only professional friends Atticus has as Sheriff Tate.  Paul Fix presides over the famous courtroom scenes, in addition to asking Atticus to carry the unbearable load of defending the case that can't be defended in that town at that time.<br /><br />In America (and, dare I say, other parts of the world) issues of prejudice and racism have not completely subsided.  But the days of Emmitt Till seem long ago and far away.  It took something to change the minds or racist Southerners not that many generations away from slavery.  "To Kill A Mockingbird" has done as much to advance the principles of fairness and justice as any single work of history.  It's that important.</p></body></html>

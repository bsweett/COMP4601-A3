<meta name="summary" content="The preeminent serial killer movie"></head><body><p>We plummet the depths of depravity here.  Arrogance never got such a cinematic comeuppance (not to mention gluttony, pride, greed and the rest of the seven deadly sins), nor was innocence ever made such an alien as in  this masterpiece of monstrous intent.  Morgan Freeman stars as William  Somerset, a wise and modest big city homicide detective ready to retire who  finds himself partnered with David Mills, an arrogant young detective  effortlessly depicted by Brad Pitt.  As they try to find the killer there  develops between them a nice chemistry that helps to make this an  engrossing movie.  Kevin Spacey arrives after a bit as "John Doe," a 20th  century version of a medieval scribe obsessed with sin morphed into a  monster from hell.  He sees himself as the personal judge, executioner and  torturer extraordinaire of a vengeful god gone amuck.<p>Momma, lock the  doors and bar the windows.  Don't let this video into your home.  You'll  watch it, every last minute, and your kids will watch it, several times,  their eyes between their fingers, and the end result will be a cynicism  about humanity so deep that it'll take the blood of the lamb to wash it  clean.<p>Well, that, or the realization that this is just Hollywood up to  its old tricks.  After all it's only a movie-or is there something more to  this extraordinary commercialization of evil?  One of the penetrating  things about Seven is the implication that, through the Christian concept  of sin and by our very nature, we ourselves create the serial killer and  give him a justification to turn upon us and do his wretched deeds.  The  ending slyly suggests the triumph of evil; and indeed this cagey movie  would be depressing beyond redemption were it not for the three things:  One, the modest wisdom projected by Morgan Freeman; two, the essential  innocence of Brad Pitt's character; and three, the fact that the horrible  deeds are the work of only one man.  Whether he is just an insane "nut-bag"  as Pitt's character exclaims, or part of our nature as the film implies, is  an interesting question.<p>Serial killer film makers of the future will try  to top this one, but I doubt if it will happen any time soon.  This is  already a classic.  Incidentally, I do wonder about these guys (Walker and  Fincher) who lie awake nights dreaming up this stuff.  I hope they're only  doing it for the money.<p>  By the  way, perfect font for the credits.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good Will Smithing"></head><body><p>The Pursuit of Happyness is based on the true life story of Chris Gardner (played by Will Smith), a bone density scanner salesman seeking to make a career change in 1981 to become a stockbroker. He pursues his dream in spite of his wife leaving him, and insists on custody of his son, Christopher. He finally lands an unpaid, six-month internship, where only one of twenty candidates will be offered a paying job. Every obstacle imaginable is in his path, but father and son will just have to prevail.<br /><br />I looked forward to seeing this movie with some trepidation. The title for one thing, had me on guard against the protaganist being some kind of misspelling apologist, and I am adamantly opposed to people of that kidney. Early on, however, I was disabused of that notion, and found instead that the central character was in fact, a correct spelling stickler. What a relief.<br /><br />He is also a fan of the poetic writing of Thomas Jefferson in The Declaration of Independence, and in voice-over ruminates on how Jefferson , in his wisdom, realized that perfect happiness might not ever be possible, but was something that nevertheless, all had a right to pursue.<br /><br />The other contributing factor to the aforementioned trepidation was that this retelling of the Horatio Alger rags-to-riches fable would be tedious drudgery. Too much hard work. This was not your usual Hollywood mindless entertainment, instant gratification for Live-For-The-Momentsters, but it was well worth the time and effort invested. Hard work, yes, but productive work that paid many dividends.<br /><br />In a promotional appearance on a talk show (probably Letterman, since I eschew Leno) with his real life son Jaden Smith in tow (who also plays his character's son in the film), Will Smith bragged about what a great actor his son was. He had even given him advice pertaining to his own acting that had greatly enhanced his performance. I was very skeptical of this claim, because of course he would be biased in his son's favor. But, after seeing the film, I would have to agree with him. His son did a great job walking that tight rope between being cute, but not so damn cute that it becomes annoying.<br /><br />A prime example of that is the kid who plays Bobby Jr. on the sitcom, All of Us: Khamani Griffin. In case you haven't seen it, the show was conceived and created by Will Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and is based on their own modern approach to raising kids with divorced parents, in evolving, caring relationships. Bobby Jr. is so repulsively cute that he would make anyone want to puke after watching him for five seconds. Surprisingly, that never happens in this movie, possibly because of the harrowing situations father and son goes through together.<br /><br />Will Smith did some great acting here as well. One scene in a Metro/BART terminal restroom was very moving. Homeless, he and his son are forced to sleep there, and he tries to make it an adventure. He is lugging one of his unsold bone density scanners, which he has rescued from a crazy street person who believed it was a time machine. He tells his son it really is a time machine, and when they press the button, pretends they are back in the time of dinosaurs, and the restroom is a cave. He cries actual tears here, and is totally believable. Another scene with a Rubik's Cube shows another side of his thespian skills, as well as evoking 1981. Another scene where he must interview for the stockbroker internship in paint splattered jeans was well done. Don't ask why. Parking tickets. If you have ever lived in San Francisco, you would know what that was like.<br /><br />In fact, San Francisco in 1981 was pretty much how it looked in this movie. Sometimes movies or TV Shows are set in San Francisco, but they get everything wrong. Like you know it was shot in LA, with just a few establishing shots of the Golden Gate Bridge thrown in, but totally in the wrong place. Suddenly Susan, Full House, Greg & Dharma--even Bullet, with Steve McQueen had him in the Tenderloin, and then on the next block, suddenly he was in The Marina. The crazy street person (John Robb) who thought his bone density scanner was a time machine was a bit jarring, like the tone suddenly shifted, and we were in a different, less realistic movie, or one of those stupid sitcoms, but since this was based on the real-life experience, I have no doubt that it probably happened exactly as depicted. All of the rest of the people were very believable, especially the stockbrokers. A friend of mine, who actually was a stockbroker intern during that same time and place concurred that it was pretty accurate.<br /><br />Finally, I was pretty excited when I saw the opening credits and found that Thandie Newton was in it, but she didn't have much to do as his wife but nag and eventually leave him. Oh, well. That is a pursuit for another movie, I suppose.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Depressingly bland"></head><body><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />The positive word-of-mouth about Iron Man all talked about what a "new" look at the superhero movie this was, so imagine my surprise when I sat down to watch this draggy and utterly formulaic "origin story" directed tediously and with little flair by Jon Favreau; with typical comic book types like the fetching assistant Pepper Potts (a bored Gwyneth Paltrow) and evil Iron Monger (scenery-chewing Jeff Bridges), an utterly boring plotline and some troubling inconsistencies (notice how just before Tony Stark has his epiphany about the evils of violence he takes the time to torch as many Arabs as he can) Iron Man is a surprisingly and depressingly bad film.<br /><br />2/4</p></body></html>

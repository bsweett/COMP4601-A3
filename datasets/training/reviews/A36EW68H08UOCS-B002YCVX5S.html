Like many of Tarantino's works, the film is one seemingly unrelated episode after another in the first half, and you're not surprised when the diverse plotlines finally converge in a blood-spattered finale.  So, if blood spattering is not you're thing you'll want to steer clear.  I personally can't stand films featuring violence for the sake of violence, but Tarantino always takes time to introduce character motivations so that you know why they kill, maim, etc.  I watched this film back to back with the French wolf movie "Brotherhood of the Wolf" and that stylish film became quite dull as characters killed and maimed for no apparent reason.  Tarantino, acknowledged as a master of dialogue, displays a deft and layered wit in his plot as well.  In many ways I was reminded of his circular masterpiece "Pulp Fiction" with its cast of over-the-top characters weaving in and out of each other's lives.<br /><br />Also like "Pulp Fiction", Basterds is told in Chapters (complete with screen markers and Chapter Titles).  In the opening Chapter Pierre LaPadite, a farmer in Nazi-Occupied France, is chopping wood when his daughters spy a caravan of Nazi vehicles headed toward them.  Monsieur LaPadite orders his daughters into the house as Col Hans Landa approaches.  Tarantino expertly builds tension: Col Landa (played by Christoph Waltz in an Oscar-winning role) is famed as "The Jew Hunter" and after LaPadite invites the Colonel inside the audience is shown that the Dreyfus family is hiding under the floorboards.<br /><br />In the second chapter we meet Brad Pitt as Lt Aldo Raine - a backwoods officer from Tennessee who has orders to assemble a crack team of Jewish soldiers eager to drop behind enemy lines and scalp Nazis.  This team form the title characters.<br /><br />Daniel Bruhl plays Pvt Fredrick Zoller - the "German Sgt York" who earned glory killing scores of enemies of the Reich from a bell-tower.  Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels has made "Pride of Nation" based on Zoller's heroic exploits, and the film careens toward a climax at the Paris premiere of "Pride of Nation", with Hitler, Goebbels and the rest of Germany's high council.  Pitt and the rest of his team have plans to interfere with that premiere, held at a cinema owned by Melanie Laurent, a French Jew who survived the murder of her family by Landa's soldiers four years earlier.<br /><br />This film oozes with QT's cinematic virtuosity.  He finds ways to quote not only American film-making icons like David O. Selznick, but also famed German film propagandists Riefenstahl and G.W. Pabst.  Tarantino veterans Samuel Jackson and Harvey Keitel appear only as voices: Jackson as narrator and Keitel as an American General speaking on the radio in a key late scene.  QT's beloved "Mexican Standoff" appears again in a set piece scene that begins in a French basement bar with drunken celebrating German soldiers playing a "who am I?" guessing game with famed German actress Bridget von Hammersmark (played by Diane Kruger), who is acting as a double-spy who hopes to spirit the "Basterds" into the premiere of "Pride of Nation." Tarantino continues his foot fetish and affinity for nicknames: "The Jew Hunter", "Aldo the Apache."  "The Jew Bear", one of Pitt's squad, is played by "Hostel" director Eli Roth: his Donny Donowitz is feared as a Golem from Hitler to the lowliest footsoldier - although the team is known for literally scalping their victims, the Bear is known for beating their skulls with a baseball bat. (Hey, I didn't say it was pretty...)  Til Schweiger, Germany's biggest movie star, takes a supporting role here as Sgt Hugo Stiglitz, a ferocious German soldier who joins Pitt's team after rescue from a military prison.<br /><br />It perhaps seems that I have given much away - but the joy of this film is seeing how the pieces fit together.  Tarantino makes certain that the pieces fit in a bloody, entertaining way.</p></body></html>

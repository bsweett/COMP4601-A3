<meta name="summary" content="The Hype It Isn't."></head><body><p>ALIEN VS. PREDATOR was pretty much exactly what I thought it would be. The movie could have been a lot better, but it could have been a lot worse, too. The movie kind of explains part of the history between the two different races, but doesn't go into much detail. The movie takes a while to get going and because the people in the movie are killed rather quickly, it doesn't leave much room for suspense.<br /><br />One thing I am curious about from the film. Lance Henriksen play Charles Bishop Weyland, a man who is the father of modern robotics and likes to dabble in archeology. In ALIENS, Henriksen portrayed the android Bishop who was responsible for saving Ripley's life.  I don't think the connection is a fluke:  did Weyland create Bishop?  I don't know, but it's kind of fun to think about.<br /><br />Overall, ALIEN VS. PREDATOR is a decent movie and average sci-fi flick. Perhaps it will make more sense in the future once more of these films are made (and they will be).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The best DVD Treatment - you will be AMAZED!"></head><body><p>Superman is, of course, the best, the sequels were so-so.  Considering it was filmed in 1977, the special effects are still stunning.  The DVD has been given the ultimate restoration in a way that makes the film seem brand new.  The picture is pristine, and the soundtrack - well, where do I begin with how brilliant it is?  The 5.1 remix sound has been carefully done to give the viewer an experience like no other. It's the first DVD older movie I have experienced with exceptional 5.1 sound.  Nothing can quite prepare you for how brilliant it is. Even if you don't really like the film, buy it because the sound effects will blow your mind.  Margot Kidder is great in this film, whereas she became annoying in the other Superman films.</p></body></html>

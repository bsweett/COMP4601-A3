<meta name="summary" content="Lots of fun!"></head><body><p>Very enjoyable movie!  It is about opposing forces, all in search of Ponce de Leon's Fountain of Youth.  Our hero, Captain Jack Sparrow/Johnny Depp, also has to contend with the infamous Blackbeard the Pirate (Ian McShane).  Penelope Cruz plays Angelica, a swash-buckling counterpart to Captain Jack who is obviously enamored with him.  Much of the film is on the sea, as one would expect.  We encounter mermaids on our journey which are not the nice ones we are used to - but then, they don't think humans are very nice either.<br /><br />It's a good time, all 2 hours 21 minutes of it!  There's lots of action, stunts, and funny one-liners with impeccable timing (e.g. I hope there are no termites in your wooden leg.) The movie was engaging the entire time.<br /><br />I LOVED the film and would definitely watch it again.  I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />My 37-year old son also loved it.  He has watched the other 3 Pirates of the Caribbean movies many times.  He gives it a 4 ? star.  The only thing he found was he believed the music to be not as well synced with the scenes as the other 3 movies.  He would watch it again also.</p></body></html>

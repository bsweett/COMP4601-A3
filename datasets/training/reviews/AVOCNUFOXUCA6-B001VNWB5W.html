This movie proves that "Watchmen" was, indeed, possible to film, but that doing so may have been a bad idea.<br /><br />The major problem with this movie is not its length.  It's way, way too long - but that's a symptom of the problem, which is lack of focus.  Act 1 takes a long time to develop, and when it's over an hour or so into the movie, there's an unsettling feeling you get as the audience that comes from the fact that you don't know what the plot is even after 60 minutes.  Then, when the movie finally gets some focus, it's on - Nite Owl and Silk Spectre?  Huh?  The least interesting characters?  Rorschach is a jerk, but has a kind of purity as a character that makes him interesting.  Veidt, who is almost an afterthought in this movie, has a kind of purity about his character as well, but in a different way; he has chosen to follow ideals that may vary from Rorschach's, or that may be the same but implemented differently.  The ultimate confrontation in "Watchmen" is really between Veidt and Rorschach, so it's a shame Veidt is given such short shrift in most of the movie.  Veidt, rather than a central protagonist (antagonist?), is the Oliver Twist of the movie, the cipher whose motives and character just happen to be there because they're in the script.  Instead of developing Veidt, we get some unconvincing romance between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre, some overly long scenes on Mars, and a variety of other bits not important to the plot.  Not great from a storytelling perspective.<br /><br />Several shots and musical choices in this long, long movie were so hamhanded as to stand out from the remainder in an unfavorable way.  Why a minute-long crane shot prior to the Comedian's funeral?  That thing must have taken an entire day to shoot on its own, for no good end.  "99 Luftballons" as Silk Spectre meets Nite Owl for dinner?  At high volume?  For a long time?  There are many points in Watchmen where I wished the director would just get on with it.  Deliberate pacing is one thing, and can be very effective.  But there's a difference between deliberate pacing, and lingering over nothing.<br /><br />And speaking of hamhandedness, I agree with the main review that "Watchmen" seems like a transcription of the graphic novel at times.  Nowhere is that more obvious than the Rorschach origin scene.  A single frame of something horrific on the printed page has tremendous visceral impact.  Playing that out in an actual segment of movie is too much, and is over the top.  In addition, the 70s style depiction of New York as a cesspool of horrors each worse than the last is likely to be incomprehensible to younger viewers who did not live through the era of the bankruptcy of NYC.  The similar depiction of the constant threat of nuclear annihilation brought back some memories, but will be equally unfamiliar to younger viewers.  These underlying moods of the film lead to some jarring tonal shifts, and render "Watchmen" ultimately a serious downer.<br /><br />Geeks of a certain age, like myself, were going to watch this no matter what.  I can't recommend doing so, but if you're like me, you're going to do it anyway.  Save a few bucks and just rent this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="FUN, TRUE-TO-LIFE ROMANTIC COMEDY"></head><body><p>Kate Winslet is Iris, a prim young Englishwoman whose unrequitted love for a seemingly clueless ex-boyfriend is eating her alive.  Cameron Diaz is Amanda, a rather spastic American businesswoman for whom love has once again proven an unfaithful affair.  When the two swap houses for a two-week holiday at Chritmas time, will it be the new beginning both women need, or just another pitfall in the jungle of life?<br /><br />It's a good plot, and one the leads carry off remarkably well.  Winslet and Diaz each do a good job of bringing their well-written roles to life, and Jude Law, Rufus Sewell and Jack Black are equally strong as the men in their lives.  Eli Wallach is great in a surprising and important role as a retired Hollywood screenwriter, and the friendship between he and Iris is stirring to watch develop.  The aforementioned script is rich and well-conceived, rarely descending to the low level common to most romantic comedies, and the opening monologue from Iris in which she bares her soul and describes the pangs of unrequitted love is the essence of truth.<br /><br />Though not what I would call a cinema classic, THE HOLIDAY is an enjoyable, frequently inspiring date movie that I am glad to have taken my wife to.  Recommended to all couples who love watching movies together.</p></body></html>

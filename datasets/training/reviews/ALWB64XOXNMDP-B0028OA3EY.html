<meta name="summary" content="Superman Returns Better than Ever!!"></head><body><p>Super Spoiler Ahead for those who didn't see the film.  Don't read this if you didn't see the film!<br /><br />Superman Returns was better than the original.  In this version Superman leaves earth for five years to explore the remains of Krypton.  In that time 9/11 occurs.  Lois writes a Pulitzer Prize winning article "Why We don't need a Superman."  She eventually develops a relationship with Perry White's son.  We get the impression the offspring is from her bond with her new man.  Although after the first hour we get to see who the son's father really is.<br /><br />There are scenes that make this movie better than the first version.  We don't have Superman changing the course of time to save Lois Lane.  Kevin Spacy plays a much darker and sinister Luther.  Frank Langella portrays the newpaper mogul in a less cartoony fashion that Jackie Cooper did in 78'.  I have to credit the director Bryan Singer for casting a better Lois Lane.  At least this one bears a resemblance to the one in the comics.  Unlike the Lois in Superman: The Movie with Christopher Reeve.<br /><br />There was a controversy behind the 78' version.  The original creators, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were living in poverty with little or no money to live.  It would have been an embarrassment to Warner Brothers and DC comics if there wasn't a settlement to resolve the matter.<br /><br />DC artist, Neal Adams helped Siegel and Shuster obtain a legal defense to fight the case. Until recently the son of one of the creators passed away.  There is a documentary being produced about how the characters were taken away from the creators.  Back in the 1930s there was little known about copyright law.  Siegel and Shuster sold the rights only to regret that for the rest of their lives.  The recent article about the creators was a sad one.  The family has little or no financial benefit from an icon in American Comics.  Till this day the family is still struggling against DC Comics and Warner Brothers to get some sort of financial restitution after over 60 years.<br /><br />There are those who could say that the family is being greedy in asking for some type of financial gain.  I'd like to see the new documentary reveal the fact that the creators had been robbed of recognition and financial security.<br /><br />I don't know if the same is true in Canada and other countries marketing the new Superman movie; but look at all the merchandise!  I remember long ago when the first film appeared there was no where near the amount of cups, T-shirts and anything that could fit the Super logo on it.<br /><br />I do remember purchasing a $2.25 novel written by E. Nelson Bridewell (from DC Comics). It was an unrelated story that took place in the Superman universe. I never got the chance to read it. From what I've read the novel was one of the better ones.  I was surprised there weren't more.  At the time Marvel was releasing their own versions of prose novels.  The books were written by the popular names of the era; Marv Wolfman, Len (Wolverine CO-creator) Wein, and a few others.<br /><br />One of the commercial tie-in products I purchased were the Justice League Unlimited DVDs.  I wondered why the cartoons were played so late in the evening.  Well, the content is adult and is for older kids.  In one of the episodes Superman is under the influence of a flower alien parasite that controls his mind.  The first scene in his dream state shows his bedroom; with wife Lois Lane. Nothing inappropriate in the way of dialogue, but something I didn't expect to see in what is supposedly a kid cartoon. In the story by comics legend Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons of "Watchmen" fame"; Superman sees what his life might have been.  The parasite also gets a chance at Wonder Woman and Batman, but the parasite ends up on the black hat of this episode.  Seeing the villain looked so much like Darkside, I couldn't remember his name. Perhaps it was Mongul or Mogul.<br /><br />The other episodes featured Booster Gold.  Booster is a man who traveled in the past with current inventions and posed them as his own.  To tell you the truth, I stopped reading the comics so long ago, I haven't kept up with the characters anymore.  I just don't have the time.  I do see that the books are oriented to specific age groups more than my generation.  Back in the seventies you'd be lucky if you saw at least three titles with the same hero.  Today there are four, five and even more with the X-Men and Superman.<br /><br />There was a special features section that featured the actors.  The actor who portrayed the Green Lantern, John Stewart was from MAD TV.  It was hard to believe that this fellow had such a deep voice.  And here I thought the actor who played the part was a large guy.  There were other mini features that showed the physics behind Superman's powers.  Superman supposedly flies faster than the speed of sound.  That means video cameras couldn't catch him.  The whole idea of Superman changing in a phone booth is out of date today.  Not in the cell phone era at least.<br /><br />Superman is not the wimpy type that the comics often portrayed him as.  That is one of the aspects the new film touched upon.  Superman was modernized a bit so new audiences could appreciate him.  You could argue that he didn't fight enough for Lois Lane.  However in this film he stood his ground and wasn't a sap in front of Lois.  I did notice how the other actor who portrayed Lois's new beau was Cyclops of X-Men fame.  It looks like he was a contender for the Superman role.<br /><br />The days of skilled pen and ink rendering is gone.  It's created in a computer.  Comics have lost a lot of the nickel, dime charm and technology has taken over.  I like new things, but comics have lost their innocence.  Especially when the books are $2.99 apiece.  It looks like the video games are replacing the regular comics story.  That is why I have purchased the DVD collections of some of the old Marvel Comics.  So far I purchased the first 500 issues of the FF and Spidey and Mad on DVD and CD ROM.  That's enough reading for me for the next 10 years.  I do hope this catches on because I don't have the room to store all those in hard copy.<br /><br />If you like the Super hero cartoons your in for a treat this month.  I just picked up Superman the Animated Series Season 3.  It has 18 episodes with three accompanying directors commentaries.  Bruce Timm has a lot to say about the creation of each show and why decisions were made to streamline them for audiences.  I'd like to see more comics related animation from him.  Each project he's associated with has respect for it's source material.  When Batman: The animated series premiered all those years ago I was expecting a big letdown. I was glad to be wrong.  Comics were part of my childhood long ago and it's good to see that the classic ones are still around.  Although comics are no where near as popular as they used to be, they still have an audience.</p></body></html>

Now, that being said, the movie is watchable in the same light as Armageddon, Volcano, Day After Tomorrow, or any of the other "End of the World" schlock that exists.  These movies are the 2000s equivalent of the "post-apocalyptic" genre of the 80s.<br /><br />What can mankind do to save the ENTIRE world?  Well, a handful of the world's best scientists ought to do the trick.  I was on-board for the ride once this movie got rolling.  I bought into space shuttle landing, I even bought the excessively-long "pigeon genocide", but I had to draw the line at "The-single-female-space-pilot-ties-a-windsor-knot" scene.  It took me a while to recover from that.<br /><br />All these things being said, I enjoyed the movie.  Truly it is only a time-killer and not to be taken for ANYTHING more than that.  It is not a social statement.  It is not a "humans-are-bad" statement.  It is JUST A MOVIE.  There are plenty of worse movies that actually get awards each year.<br /><br />It is kind of interesting that the Earth that the heros are trying to save plays the only antagonist in the movie...but let's not start "social dialogue" at this point....</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Former Spy and Top Non-Fiction Reviewer Applauds"></head><body><p>Most reviewers are missing what insiders would recognize as a very credible scenario for the various assassinations that have taken place in America.  I found this movie compelling and I certainly do not subtract anything for any of what others found to be "bombs, babes, and booze."  News flash: that's what it's like.<br /><br />The movie kept me guessing until the end, and I like it so much I am adding it to my list of "Great Spy DVDs" and palcing it second after only Breach.  This movie has a real message that most miss: privatizing our spies and our military is absolutely the fastest way to out-source and lose our national honor.<br /><br />Four books I especially recommend, for those who want to reflect on just how ugly it can get when money or ideology rather than honor talks:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400097819">Licensed to Kill: Hired Guns in the War on Terror</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452287081">Confessions of an Economic Hit Man</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470098287">The Global Class War: How America's Bipartisan Elite Lost Our Future - and What It Will Take to Win It Back</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0275969878">How to Prevent Genocide: A Guide for Policymakers, Scholars, and the Concerned Citizen</a></p></body></html>

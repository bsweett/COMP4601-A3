<meta name="summary" content="Jaw-droppingly amazing special effects crash!"></head><body><p>This movie has a coolness factor high enough to warrant the 4 star treatment!  The automobile accident that starts off this film far surpasses the originals' airplane explosion for suspense, originality, and flat-out "how in the....did they do that?!" amazingness.<p>While this isn't a GREAT film for the ages, it is certainly a film that can hold its own against more than a handful of films of similar nature.  The characters are believable and fresh and run the gamut in age - it's no longer a "teen" flick.<p>Look - I don't want to give away the nuances of the film - but remember it's a sequel to a "you-are-about-to-die-but-you-just-don't-know-how" film and it keeps that same suspense going, but it takes it a step further and makes it better.<p>This is a case of a sequel being better than the film that spawned it.<p>Check it out!</p></body></html>

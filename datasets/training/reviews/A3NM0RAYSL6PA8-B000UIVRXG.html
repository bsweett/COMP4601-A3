You need to know that, because some people in the audience were shocked to see several people die in, well, clinical detail, shall we say. When the second half of the movie descended into all out war, many (myself included) were swept away by it. Others, unfortunately, staggered out of the theater a bit ... shell-shocked. Visually smart and filled with winks and homages to other films, this is a fat-free film. Everything's a set up, and everything has a pay-off. So pay attention class! (Okay, pay attention the second time you see it. There's enough gold to be mined that you'll be back.)</p></body></html>

The cast for this film was perfect on all accounts. You can't help but feel for and fall for the tender-hearted,  illiterate hulk, John Coffey. The gentle giant being falsely accused of the  horrible murder of two little girls who were sisters makes you think about  how we view circumstantial evidence... if I had been at the ficticious  crime scene, I would have found him guilty, too.<p>The twists and turns are  pleasant surprises throughout the film and you will remember a little mouse  (&quot;Mr. Jingles&quot;) for the rest of your life after seeing this  film.<p>The film is not appropriate for young viewers because of the  violence, executions, language and other adult themes... but a young  teenager has probably already seen and heard everything above and beyond  what this film delivers as far as &quot;adult content&quot; on prime time  TV.<p>The film is long, but it never feels as long as it is. The story is  intense, however, and I can't imagine watching it over and over again...  although DVD helps you jump to certain scenes you enjoy, such as watching  Mr. Jingles push a spool across the floor!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="CGI overload"></head><body><p>You'd never know that the special effects juggernaut that is the Day After Tomorrow was based on a book by Whitley Striber, but the one thing you will know is that the never ending surge of CGI enhanced weather disasters are brought to you by the same team that brought us the special effects turkey Independence Day.  There's no point of going into the story since there isn't much of one to describe, just that Denis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal are wasted in their roles as a father and son who are caught in the middle of an end of the world-esque weather phenomina that catapaults the planet into chaos.  Make no mistake that the CGI effects are a sight to behold, and the Day After Tomorrow can be taken as a guilty pleasure, but other than that it's as lame as it looks.  Those who want a mindless escape may want to check it out, but even then you are better off with something else.</p></body></html>

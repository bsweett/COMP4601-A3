Not sure why I put off watching it for so long, but I finally popped it in last night.<br /><br />At first I had a lot of reservations about the flick. The "hand held shaky" cam thing has been done to death with "Cloverfield", "Quarantine" & "Diary of the Dead". But there is a good reason a majority of the film is presented in this format which is laid out right at the beginning of the film. And while there are many scenes shot with the hand held camera, quite a bit of the film is shot in conventional style as well.<br /><br />The basic storyline is that aliens have come to Earth, most likely by accident, but we are never really told for sure. They've been living among us now for almost 3 decades and now must reside in a slum known as district 9. Crime is out of control, human citizens of Johannesburg want the aliens (prawns) taken out of the city. And as the film begins, we meet a low level bureaucrat who has been put in charge of relocating the aliens to a spot 200 miles outside of the city. Neither the aliens or the Nigerian gang who control the black market in district 9 want to relocate...and both are willing to kill to keep it from happening.<br /><br />I see some folks drawing similarities between "District 9" and a host of other Sci-Fi films, but I still think this is one of the most original films to come out in theaters the past couple years.<br /><br />The special effects are amazing. I normally hate CGI effects in a movie. More often than not they look like cartoons, but the CGI animation in "District 9" is phenomenal. The "prawns" look amazing, and for big buggy aliens, they somehow are still able to display a wide variety of emotion. The action is top notch, but this isn't a straight action flick, the action takes a backseat to the storyline and the characters. If you like a little more depth to your sci-fi I highly recommend you pick this up.</p></body></html>

I still want to know how two of the three key pieces that composed the climax occurred. Since it's inappropriate to discuss the specifics of any climax in a review, I'll respect that. But I have to say: not only do I not really understand how it happened, I thought it was very poorly constructed. In addition to that, the d&eacute;nouement was fairly pedantic and, at best, without real feeling.<br /><br />OK. So much with the conclusion - the climax and the denouement. The concept for this film - a monster hunter with inexplicable longevity who works for an underground "sect" of the Catholic Church - isn't a bad one. European monsters have long held our attention: vampires, Dracula, the werewolf, Frankenstein, and even Mr. Hyde. The main problem with the attempt to bring all of this together is that the writers didn't truly understand the nature of the monsters, or the fundamental arguments and/or nature of good and evil. What we saw in that regard was mostly sophomoric.<br /><br />Question #1 that I had: Why was Mr. Hyde in this movie? He seemed to serve only as a prelude to bring Van Helsing to the Church. Things should only exist in a film or book (any medium) if they are integral to the structure - not if they are merely a vehicle. This was a vehicle. There was also a problem with Mr. Hyde: he was larger than The Hulk. And yet, with such incredible strength, Van Helsing not only subdues him, but kills him. Amazing? No. Dumb.<br /><br />Question #2: Humans in this film were capable of sustaining mind numbing damage. Van Helsing himself should have been dead during his first monster encounter with Mr. Hyde. Van Helsing was hit hard - HARD - multiple times, and didn't appear to sustain even a broken bone.<br /><br />Since Van Helsing had somewhat immortal qualities (if the reason for his longevity was touched upon, I missed it), I could understand some of that. But what about the Valerios family? Anna sustained damage throughout the film that would have killed a herd of elephants, and had this rather remarkable ability to walk up walls and do somersaults off of them. What was that about? Is this strength bestowed upon her through some mysticism of the Catholic Church? Who knows? We sure don't. That means it isn't credible.<br /><br />Question #3: If Dracula wanted Anna dead so badly, and his three "brides" proved themselves entirely incapable of such a feat after repeated failures, why didn't he do it himself? This is a major problem in many fantasy, horror, thriller, or suspense films (or books for that matter). Instead of trying to work out a reason for why the Dracula figure doesn't take matters into his own hands (which would require too much creativity, apparently), they simply ignore it. But think about it. You're Dracula. You want this girl dead. Your brides can not accommodate your wishes. Would *you* allow them to fail, time and again, or would you just walk into the village and be done with her once and for all? Remember, the longer she remains alive, the worse your chances for survival are.<br /><br />Question #4: I have never seen a movie where all of the main characters (even a clumsy Frankenstein monster) had such remarkable acrobatic and Tarzan-like vine swinging skills. If anyone was entertained by feat after feat after feat of impossible gymnastic extravaganza, well, I don't mean to insult anyone, but come on. It's absurd. Sure, at some point you have to allow for the suspension of disbelief. But as John Gardner said (and this is a rough paraphrase): "Where Folly leads, Judgment must follow. To dumb it down, things need to make sense. Perhaps if these characters had lived in the 21st century, they would have belonged to a circus. But they didn't, and without all of that training, their feats were *impossible*.<br /><br />Was there anything good about the film? Well, the special effects were good, with the exception of all of the Tarzan nonsense. The swinging here and there, and even some of the flying, appeared absurd at times, and obviously CGI created. When we have seen such remarkable special effects in recent years, specifically with the Lord of the Rings films, these flaws are quite glaring.<br /><br />I was saddened when I looked at the director's credentials. His first film of note was The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, starring then child prodigy Elijah Wood. That was a good movie. Since then, he's decided to take the amusement park route. Deep Rising (a squid attacking a ship?) The Mummy, the Mummy Returns, and the introduction of the Scorpion King? All of them, while perhaps stylish and shot well, were poorly written and offered very little climactic satisfaction. In other words, cotton candy.<br /><br />Just like Van Helsing.</p></body></html>

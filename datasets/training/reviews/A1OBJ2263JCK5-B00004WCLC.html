If your writer/ director, Paul Thomas Anderson you create a brilliant three hour opus titled "Magnolia", involving a television quiz show and nine desperate, lonely, interelated characters.This is sort of the film version of the pop culture game, "The Six degrees of Kevin Bacon".But instead of Kevin Bacon, everyone has some sort of connection to a Jeopardy style game show. Some characters are intricately involved with the show, while others have a fleeting connection.The movie introduces us to a lonely police officer, a sexist motivational speaker, a dying old man, his unstable younger wife, a male nurse,a drug addict,a has-been former child celebrity, a game show host and finally a child prodigy.Besides the TV program, all these characters share that they are in desperate, lonely, pain (emotional,physical or sometimes both).All these characters feel that they have love to give, but they just don't know where or how to place it.They have all made mistakes in the past and they want a second chance.As John C. Reilly's lonely cop says, "sometimes people need a little help, sometimes they need to be forgiven, that's a tricky call". P.T. Anderson has crafted and structured an amazing film. In the first forty minuets, everything seems messy and all over the place. With lightning speed pacing and cross cutting he presents us facts about all nine people.But as time goes on, the pacing slows down and we strip away layer apon layer (or petal after petal) and learn about what motivates these people. You would think that this would be a depressing film, but it actually has quite a cathartic feel to it (especially the very stange, out of nowhere, ending). The wonderful script is brought to life by a great ensemble cast.Standouts include Julianne Moore, Melora Walters, John C. Reilly, William H.Macy and Tom Cruise. But to be honest all the actors give fantastic performances.Special note should also be made for the wonderful soundtrack made up of songs written and sung by  music artist, Aimee Mann. Supposedly these songs inspired Anderson in writing this film.The DVD of the movie is superb. It has a wonderful clear picture and sound. There is a whole second disc packed with extras including an hour and a half, detailed, video diary of the making of the film. This is a great DVD and a must for fans of good drama!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Shallow on the psychological side"></head><body><p>A simple story of an undercover federal agent who kills the son of a drug and casino lord in Florida and is found out by the aforesaid gang-lord. This gangster starts his vengeance and kills dozens of people, including the wife and son of the federal agent, and the federal agent himself. But there is a god for such victims and the federal agent survives. Then he starts his own vengeance and that will mean a complete deserted and uninhabited waste land after his passage. Simple and effective. One of the first executions will be the rotten cop who had delivered his identity to the gang-lord. There is no morality in that, no hope or future, no tomorrow even if the film saves the main character from suicide thanks to some kind of love desire that will probably not be satisfied and if it is who cares. It is well done but definitely superficial as for the psyche of these people, both on the side of federal agents and on the side of gangsters: mechanical killing robots.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></body></html>

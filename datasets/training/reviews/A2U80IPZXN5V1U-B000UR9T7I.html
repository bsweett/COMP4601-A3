<meta name="summary" content=""Three Villains Is Too Much!""></head><body><p>After two sucesfull and critically acclaimed movies,Spiderman returns to the big screen in 2007 in his third movie.While most fans knew it wouldn't turn out to be the best of the serie they still expected a good Spiderman movie.This third film in the franchise is certainly entertaining and visualy impressive and even funny at parts some could say.Yet critics said,and i have to agree with them that the decision to have three villains in the movie was probably thw worst thing to do.Those movie producers will say: "the more villains,the better",and Spiderman 3 proves that its not necessarily true.That confused a few,three bad guys in the same movie and battling Spiderman at the same time can indeed be comfusing but still the third film in the series remains a good superhero movie.<br /><br />In my opinion there are way too many superhero movies nowadays as it seems that movie studios have learned how great profits comic superhero based movies could generate.X-Men,Fantastic Four make and countless others made their beggenings on the big screen recently while other older superheroes make a comeback such as Batman,Superman and others.Spiderman managed so far to deliver a great superhero experience troughout all the trilogy and to distinguish from others.The first two films have been great translations of the famous Marvel comic to the big screen,filled with drama,action and with romance as well.Comes this third filled with action and villains,it clearly ain't the best of the three as i expected but it was still a good experience at the theater for me.<br /><br />I this third movie the storyline is kind of wicked because of the three villains but remains pretty solid overral.Peter still has feelings for Mary Jane and turns to another girl.His uncle Ben's death is further explored in this film and the killer's identity as well.Add to that Peter faces dark times with the dark Spidey suit and three villains after him and tha's the movie in short.There probably won't be as fourth Spidey because the actors wanted to move on to do other movies and that is probably packed this one with villains and all that.Also the movie relies on many great special effects maybe too much.<br /><br />Spiderman 3 is different from the other films in the franchise and that is great as sometimes sequels are too much like the original and they have no creativity,or they go too far and completly loose it.Spiderman 3 does not make those mistakes it still has some elements of the original but with a big touch of creativity.I tought Peter Parker discovering the dark suit was very interresting as it gave him this kind of dark personna nobody would have expect that too happen.His scenes in the cafe as dark spiderman are quite funny,i think that got a good laugh out of pretty much everyone!And i must admit the dark suit is pretty cool.<br /><br />The major mistake they did in the proccess of creating this third Spiderman is that they putted three vilains in it,reminescent of the Batman and Robin movie from the 1990s where the heroes had to fight many villains at the same time,as i recall that did not turn out to be a succesfull experiment.Venom would have been enough to make a movie with alone,and he's probably the coolest villain in Spiderman history.The Green Goblin only appeared in the movie for less than 10 minutes,he wouldn't have been needed.Sandman has quite an interresting story and all but was he really necessary?Besides that flaw its a really good movie,every movie has some flaws.<br /><br />To conclude i must say that this movie was nearly two movies i one actually.Had they put the Sandman's parts for another movie and added more scrip based on it it could have turned great.Even with that i have to say i was really satisfied with this third movie.There was plenty of action and the other elements that made the others so good and succesfull.I must say Topher Grace from cult show,"That 70s Show" does a great job as Venom and i didn't recognize him at all until i was told it was him!Thomas Haiden Church is made a brilliant appearance as the Sandman and the rest of the cast is great as well.I definatly recommend it,even if you haven't seen Spiderman 1 and 2 you will probably have a good time watching this.4 stars,recommended!</p></body></html>

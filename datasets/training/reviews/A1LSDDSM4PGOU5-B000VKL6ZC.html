<meta name="summary" content="i liked it a bit more than the original version (3.5/5)"></head><body><p>prior to watching this movie,i'd heard people say that director Rob Zombie had butchered the franchise with his take on the Halloween lore.i don't share that viewpoint.i though the movie had a lot of good points to it.i thought the casting of Malcom McDowell was genius.he plays his character tongue in cheek,and really i think that's the whole tone of the movie.and it worked for me.there are some serious parts and the movie even has a moral,but it doesn't hit you over the head with anything.the violence is more sudden and a bit more graphic than the 1978 version.the acting is better in this movie,i think.the actor who played the grown up Micheal Myers(the psycho) is very convincing.and the child who played young Michael Myers is perfect for the role.the movie does tend to be slow in spots,but i still think it is a better movie than the original version.there is a lot of crude language in the movie and a fair amount of nudity,so be warned.for me,Halloween (2007)is a 3.5/5</p></body></html>

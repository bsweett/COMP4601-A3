Too bad, Orson is not of this world anymore. I would have loved to hear his own commentary. Orson Wells was a genius, a prodigy and film this incredible movie practicing what we could call for this time, avantgarde angles, lighting. editing.... If you are interested in filmmaking and golden age of the American Cinema, pick this! UN CHEF D'OEUVRE and in my opinion the best movie ever made.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A closer look at the most hated man in the world..."></head><body><p>I will say this for Mr. Stone; he is a very brave man.  He's known as one of our most controversial directors and he continues to push the envelope, not only with subject but also with construction.  Because of that he is a very `love him or hate him' kind of director.  Look at his work on films like `World Trade Center', `JFK', `Platoon' and `Natural Born Killers'.  These are all films that are so strongly opinionated and controversially designed that the illicit in the audience a reaction of acceptance or repulsion.<br /><br />Case in point; I hated `World Trade Center' yet I consider `JFK' to be one of the strongest character biopics I've seen.<br /><br />So, continuing his quest for offence, Stone decided to make a biopic on the man we all have grown to unabashedly condemn as the single worst human being brought into power in the history of the world.  Okay, so not everyone feels that way; and personally I won't even go there (since this particular subject is such a sore spot) but the general consensus is that Bush hacked up the country.  The fact that Stone wanted to do Bush's biopic is not the controversial part.  What is though is the fact that Bush was still serving as President when the film was released.  He didn't even wait for the term to end before he jumped in the director's chair and publicly critiqued the man's life.<br /><br />He may have been the most hated, but technically he was still the most powerful.<br /><br />Well, after seeing the film I can finally weigh in on how I feel Mr. Stone has done.  Stone and I have had a rocky past.  I've publicly denounced his seemingly vapid attempts to shed light on the atrocities of 9-11 or his attempt to humanize a certain rockstar, and yet, as I mentioned, he floored me with his powerhouse of a film called `JFK' and a recent viewing of `Platoon' has cemented the film in my soul.  So, lets say that I was excited to see what he could do with Bush, yet I wasn't getting my hopes up too high.<br /><br />I liked this much more than I thought I would have.<br /><br />Stone was smart in his construction here, which totally helps with the films pacing and storytelling ability.  Instead of telling the story chronologically, Stone opted to tell the story in vignettes that shift back and forth from college years to Presidency to his time as Governor.  This way the film always stays engaging.  I was shocked, but the film also never felt confusing, which sadly can happen with this style of storytelling.  The script is centered enough to keep the focus grounded and keep our attention.  I'm not a very political person and even I understood everything that was going on.  The inspired casting is also a huge bonus.  Much has been said of Brolin's performance, which is close to perfection here; but he isn't the only one.  Richard Dreyfuss, James Cromwell and Toby Jones all deliver understated yet powerful performances (Newton may have nailed her character, but she does so at the expense of the film, creating a caricature as apposed to a genuine person), especially Cromwell who embodies Bush Sr. with a sense of self-centered sympathies needed in aiding ones understanding of Bush Jr.<br /><br />So, with that said, Brolin delivers the performance of his career as President George W. Bush.  What is so impressive about this film is that while it never condones any of the horrific decisions Bush made, and it in no way shape or form paints him to be an intelligent or considerate person, it allows the audience to sympathies with the man's very human issues.  We see him being manipulated by the people around him and his genuine feelings.  Whether he is striving for his father's approval (I felt the films opening and closing with Bush in the roaring baseball stadium were perfect symbolisms of his desperation for acceptance) and struggling to find his own voice amidst the suggestions of others (that last press conference is a sublime example of this man's utter loss of individuality), `W.' paints Bush as a man, plain and simple.  No matter what your feelings are on this man and what he has done to the world, Stone delivers a sympathetic look at what could have led things to go as wrong as they did.  I was very impressed with this because it would have been very easy to spend two hours condemning a man for his mistakes.  Instead, Stone chose to point them all out yet he (along with Brolin) give this man enough of a soul that we can almost sympathize with his failure.<br /><br />What is so commendable about Brolin is that he doesn't just deliver mimicry but embodies this man with passion and uncovers who he really was, or at least who Stone perceives him to be.<br /><br />So, regardless of how accurate this one is (Stone has always been more intent of delivering his personal interpretations, which is what any visionary director SHOULD do) it is still a very insightful, enlightening and engaging portrait of a man we all think we know.  It has its flaws (some of the scenes can feel like a series of overlong conversations strung back to back) but it also has its shining moments.  If you can take the good with the bad (or visa-versa) than this is a film you should see.</p></body></html>

They rise to the occasion, like Lincoln or Truman or even "W".<br /><br />  So it was with Paul Rusesabugina, the manager of a luxury hotel in the capital of Rwanda, played superbly by Don Cheadle.<br /><br />This is but one of a handful of important movies in the last couple of years. A genocidal tribal civil war, the bloodiest in a generation was reported poorly or ignored completely by the establishment western media.<br /><br />  There are award deserving performances all over the place. Nick Nolte for one playing an overwhelmed UN peaceleeper, Col. Oliver. Another is Tatiana, Paul's wife, played wonderfully by Sophie Okonedo & of course, Mr. Cheadle.<br /><br />  The movie plays out like a game, a serious, deadly, bloody game where the accident of being born to the wrong tribe could get you hacked to death. Paul has crushing responsibilities thrust upon him. He must protect his wife & family as well as his Tutsis employees & over a thousand Tutsis refugees who have no where else to go except the gated protection of the hotel.<br /><br />  A skillful use of his contacts, bribes, blackmail & personal charm are used. He saved 1,200 people from certain death.<br /><br />  I don't like to give ***** very often.</p></body></html>

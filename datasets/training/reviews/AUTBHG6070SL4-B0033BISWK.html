The aliens, referred to as "prawns" in a derogatory slur, are clearly not just people in rubber suits - they're built, they move, and they speak in utterly unhuman ways. They also act on unhuman motives, for unhuman reasons. The disaster that leaves them as refugees on Earth appears to have no equivalent in human psychology or biology. Still, they come to life as thinking, feeling, and caring people of a sort. The directorial alchemy that brings these beings to life really drives this movie, by making us want to suspend disbelief while the story plays out.<br /><br />Plenty of hard reality helps carry us along, too. It might be a bit heavy-handed that this parable on racism takes place in the country that institutionalized apartheid. I'll take that as a placeholder, though, one that represents any country that has or has had its own tensions between different groups - in other words, just about anywhere. This creates a cinematic lab in which the many cruelties of forced segregation can be examined.<br /><br />The central character, Wikus, acts as the focus of this study. Cynical leaders set this simple-minded character up as the public face of the atrocities. Wikus, with puppy-like loyalty and eagerness to please, sees only the TV-star glory of the role. He willingly blinds himself to the policies of hatred, even genocide that he emcees for the viewing public. The most wrenching example might be when the relocation forces burn out an alien nursery, and Wikus cheerfully narrates the sounds of their eggs bursting in the flames: "like popcorn, pop-pop-pop!" This ability to dehumanize the subjugated people (alien people, but people) has appeared again and again in the worst chapters of human history, and appears with wrenching vapidity in Wikus.<br /><br />Then, when Wikus finds himself on the other side of the color line, he becomes one of the un-people. He becomes material for sadistic medical experimentation, just one more component to be bolted into the oppressor's war machine. For all this, the movie's creators never forget their duty to the summer-cinema audience. Spectacular effects, bam-pow action, chases, and explosions keep the popcorn crowd happy, at the same time that it satisfies the thinking viewers. This movie's brilliance is that it addresses the viewers who want both.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release</p></body></html>

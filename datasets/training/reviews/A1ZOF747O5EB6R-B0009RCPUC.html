Troubling in so far as the events of the final collapse of Berlin were simply so awful; satisfying in that the depiction of events seemed plausible without ever glorifying war.<br /><br />Let there be no doubt that Adolf Hitler was one of history's greatest monsters.  He catapulted Germany and much of Europe back into the middle ages as he pursued his warped ambitions.  However, it must be said that Hitler was a real person in that he had many emotions common with all people.  "Downfall" shows some of these emotions although it never seeks to excuse Hitler and his barbarous henchmen.<br /><br />In many ways, the end of the First World War was ambiguous.  Yes, Germany lost but it was never totally smashed.  An armistice was signed and reparations ultimately crippled the German economy but the country was never totally beaten.  Hitler played on this fact and the emotions it brought out in the German people.  He was a master manipulator.  The inevitable end product proved to be total annihilation of the Third Reich as Hitler cowered in his bunker.  The Red Army was literally only a few hundred metres away before he ended his life.<br /><br />Bruno Granz portrayal of Hitler is phenomenal.  Here we see all the madness and paranoia brought to the screen in vivid detail.  Granz is worthy of an Academy Award.  But along with Hitler comes all his loopy followers.  None of these is more chilling than Goebbels and his fanatic wife.  Evil is truly at work in these two.<br /><br />See this film.  Yes, it is frightening but it is also one of the best films of the year.</p></body></html>

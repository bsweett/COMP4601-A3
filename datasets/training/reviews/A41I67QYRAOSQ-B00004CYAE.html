<meta name="summary" content="Surprised little ones Love it!"></head><body><p>I saw this movie many moons ago when I was in grade school.  I thought it was a magical, entertaining story.  I bought it for my 2 and 3 year old as something I thought they'd enjoy when they got to grade school.  I was surprised to see them riveted to it for most of the program.  I was doubly surprised they wanted to watch it over and over again!  I'm pretty sure it was the singing and dancing that held their attention.  This is definitely a classic that even little ones will enjoy now!</p></body></html>

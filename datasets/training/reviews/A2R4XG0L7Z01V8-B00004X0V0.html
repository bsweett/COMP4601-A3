Most films don't, I know, but the impact is severely lessened in my opinion. The film is still great, and Will Smith does look loads better in the last suit he'll ever wear than Tommy Lee Jones.<br /><br />One of my favourite scenes in the whole movie is where Jay gets left in charge of delivering what can only be described as a baby squid. It's an absolutely hilarious scene, even though you're supposed to be concentrating on Kay in the foreground of the scene, you can't help but watch Jay get thrown about!<br /><br />One of the other brilliant scenes is the scene where Kay shows Jay some of the aliens on earth at the moment being watched, and Jay points out his old school teacher. Some of the more known celebrities on screen are: Danny DeVito, director Barry Sonnenfeld, Chloe Sonnenfeld (Barry's daughter), Sylvester Stallone (he's the one everyone spots), Dionne Warwick, George Lucas, and executive producer Steven Spielberg. I love all the jokes regarding the aliens on the planet, saying they're all cab drivers, and the very last scene is absolutely fantastic, and really effective.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones is also funny, particularly when the car is driving upside down, and he's singing along to Elvis (Jay: "You do know Elvis is dead, right?" Kay: "No, Elvis is not dead. He just went home.") The other shots you have to look for, but it's when Will Smith says something funny, and Tommy is trying to cover the fact he's trying desperately not to laugh.<br /><br />There's plenty extras on the 2-disc special edition (which means I'm probably not reviewing the correct one, as there's so many 'editions' of this movie out there), but my favourite is the "Men In Black" music video. I love the way Mickey dances. There's your usual, bog standard commentaries by Barry Sonnenfeld & Tommy Lee Jones; character animation studies; tunnel scene deconstruction; extended & alternate scenes; storyboard comparisons (I HATE these!); metamorphis of Men In Black documentary; theatrical trailers; art gallery; scene editing workshops; Edgar bug fight sceen deconstruction and creatures: concept to completion. So basically, you're getting more than your money's worth if you're interested in this sorta thing.<br /><br />This is a terrific movie, and well worth getting. I probably shouldn't say you should get the sequel as well!</p></body></html>

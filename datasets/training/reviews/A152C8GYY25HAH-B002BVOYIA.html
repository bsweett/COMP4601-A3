<meta name="summary" content="An excellent, powerful movie"></head><body><p>"Hotel Rwanda" is one of the most powerful movies of recent times. In 1994, the Hutu tribe massacred almost a million members of the Tutsi tribe in Rwanda while the Western world largely looked away. UN peacekeepers were in place, but they had no mandate to prevent the genocide. The event was viewed by the outside world as mainly a local problem or dispute.<br /><br />In the capital city, a man named Paul [Don Cheadle] managed a luxury hotel owned by a large corporation in Europe. During the uprising, he housed 1200 refugees in the hotel. He managed to save them all. A Rwandan himself, he was able to do this because he knew the ins and outs of the corrupt local politics.<br /><br />Ah, Africa! Quick! Named three movies that portray that continent accurately. Why are we so indifferent to the place? It was the West that carved Africa up into the nations we know today. It was the West that lost its control of the place. Are we indifferent because we have little control?<br /><br />Whatever the answers to these questions, "Hotel Rwanda" remains a searing movie.</p></body></html>

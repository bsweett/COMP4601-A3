What if the implanted memories were so real that you could not tell the difference between the implanted memories and reality?  What if you went to a place that implanted such memories and when you woke up, you discovered that you had lost your sense of reality and you no longer knew who you were?<br /><br />Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a laborer living an apparent life of ease (and luxury - laborers must be paid really well in 2084) with his beautiful wife Lori (Sharon Stone).  Life is good for Douglas and Lori, until Douglas gets it into his head that he wants to take a trip to Mars.  Of course, Douglas is unable to go to Mars (Lori does not want to emigrate to Mars), so Douglas heads off to Rekall to get a brain implant.<br /><br />Implanted memories are no big deal.  You go in, they put you under, you get an implanted memory, and you go home thinking you had a great time on Mars.  Douglas chose to be a spy and have a beautiful girlfriend.  Unfortunately, the friendly folks at Rekall discover that Douglas had already had an implant and their attempt to implant a new memory was creating problems in Douglas's brain.  However, the people at Rekall are able to cover up the problem and Douglas seems to walk away from Rekall without problems.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Douglas, his wife is quite upset that Douglas went to Rekall.  So upset that she works Douglas over.  The next thing Douglas knows, a bunch of guys with really big guns are trying to blow him away and he is running for his life.<br /><br />Douglas can only do one thing.  He heads for Mars and the answers to his questions.  Things on Mars get even more interesting.  A man with a dictator's power, Vilos Cohaagen (Ronny Cox, "Deliverance" and "Beverly Hills Cop"), controls Mars.  Quaid seems caught between mutants, Cohaagen and Cohaagen's henchmen, led by Richter (Michael Ironside, "Scanners," "Watchers," and "Starship Troopers").  Of course, Quaid's murderous wife is still running around.  Then there are the aliens.  You will have to watch.<br /><br />This movie is filled with action and allows you enough time to wonder what is real and what is fantasy, nearly to the end of the movie.  I thought the special effects were quite good for 1990.  There are places where you can easily see that a set is a miniature, but other miniatures are beautiful and wonderfully meshed with full-sized sets.<br /><br />Director Paul Verhoeven and a team of writers did a wonderful job of building on a 1966 Philip K. Dick short story, "We Can Remember It for You."  Even with some dated effects and styles, the movie still plays well, especially once the movie shifts to Mars.  I absolutely loved the action-packed ending, wondering just how Quaid was going to survive.  Fans of Philip K. Dick, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sharon Stone, Rachel Ticotin and science fiction movies have to see this excellent movie, one of Arnold's best.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></body></html>

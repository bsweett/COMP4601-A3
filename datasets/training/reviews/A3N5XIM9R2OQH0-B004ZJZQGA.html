<meta name="summary" content="Great movie"></head><body><p>Anyone making a movie featuring two philosophical hitmen is practically begging to be accused of ripping off Pulp Fiction, but it turns out the similarities between In Bruges and Quentin Tarantino's most famous work pretty much end there.  Where the work of the likes of Tarantino or Guy Ritchie (not to mention the recent Frank Miller adaptations) tends to emphasize style over substance (not always a bad thing, of course), In Bruges inverts the usual formula by using style to enhance substance.  It's got all the clever dialogue and unflinching violence you'd expect from a postmodern gangster film, but it's accompanied by a level of emotional depth and a view of friendship that wouldn't be out of place in a Wes Anderson movie.  Few films in recent memory (Shaun of the Dead being one recent example) have played this effectively with tone, as the movie effortlessly incorporates action, comedy, and drama, with some heavy philosophizing thrown in for good measure.  It's funny without pandering, dramatic without any histrionics, and sentimental without getting sappy.  The understated direction of writer-director Martin McDonagh suits the unusually quaint setting well, and his twist-laden plot ends up incorporating the aforementioned hitmen, a family of grossly overweight American tourists, a belligerent Canadian couple, a smoking-hot drug dealer and her skinhead ex-boyfriend/partner in crime, and a degenerate, possibly racist American dwarf actor.  There's also some nice dwarf-related humor, which is always good to see.<br /><br />Oddly, for a movie this distinctive, the plot initially doesn't seem like much of a departure from Gangster Movie Central: after a hit gone wrong (the details of which emerge pretty early in the film) British hitmen Ray and Ken (Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson) are sent to the medieval Belgian town of Bruges for a cooling-off period by their psychotic boss Harry.  The setting initially provides a source for some nice fish-out-of-water comedy (as well as a few not-so-subtle digs at Western tourists), but it's not long before the movie takes a turn into a more meditative, violent (though still frequently funny) direction.  McDonagh's offbeat approach is best exemplified by a simple conversation scene between Ray and Ken around the midway point, which segues smoothly from an earnest meditation on belief and morality to a hilarious speculation on why a middle-aged lollypop man would know Karate, with Farrell and Gleason maintaining their straight faces all the way through.  Some other scenes start to border on the surreal (particularly a coke binge with the dwarf and a few prostitutes), but the movie still manages to maintain its intelligence and solid characterizations througout.  I didn't think I'd ever catch myself writing this, but Colin Farrell turns in a brilliant, multilayered performance as the potentially suicidal Ray, whose jokey, sardonic exterior barely manages to conceal the guilt raging beneath.  The ever-reliable Brendan Gleeson is similiarly excellent as Ken, who initially appears to be little more than an older-and-wiser straight-man type but eventually emerges as a strong, loyal character in his own right.  In the other principal role, Ralph Fiennes really seems to be enjoying himself as Harry, the outrageously profane and menacing(though strangely principled) gang leader.<br /><br />Overall, I can't find much about In Bruges to complain about.  It's well-paced and sharply-written, it's got great central performances and some nice violent set pieces towards the end, and it all wraps up without overstaying its welcome.  I haven't seen many movies recently that rank high on the rewatchability scale, but this one's going to end up getting several repeat viewings.  Five stars, easy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Give Evil Hell"></head><body><p>First off let me say,I've never read a comic book in my life.I never found you had to read the comics to understand or love the films.And Hellboy was no expection.I never even heard of the comic book created by Mike Mignola (I'm sure some people hadn't heard of it too).<br /><br />Ron Perlman was born to play Hellboy,he was so perfectly cast has the half-human,half-demon..You just can't see anyone else play this character.John Hurt was good as Professor Broom,the man who raised Hellboy and I didn't reconize him at all,I knew lthe voice but couldn't place the face.Selma Blair who's an actress who sometimes really annoys me,but this time she didn't.<br /><br />Directed by Guillermo del Toro,whom turned down the chance to direct Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to do this,did a great job and not really changing the story like most directors do with Comic Book films.If someone else directed Hellboy it wouldn't have been as great as it was</p></body></html>

The acting, the direction, the plot, script...everything is utterly brilliant and can compare with today's standards and still stand out as truly inspired film.  Alfred Hitchcock was probably the smartest movie-maker of his generation, and maybe even ours, for he knew how to get what he wanted with very little, to make the most of what he had and he always delivered something smart, edgy and ahead of it's time.<br /><br />`Psycho', of course, is no exception.  Probably his most popular film, and arguably his best, `Psycho' has been the inspiration for countless rip-offs, sequels and a remake, none of which have even come close to the power of the original.  Psycho itself was inspired by the real life account of serial killer Ed Gein, and man brutally abused by his mother into believing that women were evil.  Ed Gein himself has been the inspiration for many films including `The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' and `The Silence of the Lambs', both of which fall in the line of `Psycho' as cinematic landmarks, but arguably `Psycho' was and is the most important.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to anyone who has seen this film post its original release, Hitchcock really wove a twisted web.  You see, everyone who's heard of the film after it was released has heard that it's about a crazy momma's boy who kills a woman in the shower, but knowing the story does a somewhat disservice to Hitchcock for he really went all out to weave a tangled web of mystery as to the who's and why's.  Regardless though, everything about this film is extraordinary and deserving of praise.  Of particular note is the excellent acting on the part of the entire cast, but of course Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh (who received a well deserved Oscar nomination) are particular standouts.<br /><br />I'm guessing I don't really need to explain the plot, but for the sake of discussion I will.  The movie starts by giving us some back story on our famous victim, Marion Crane (Leigh) who is involved with Sam Loomis (John Gavin) but because of his impending divorce they have no means to make it, that is until she gets her hands on $40,000.  Of course it's stolen money and the man she stole it from is all but a little unhappy.  She flees the city and stops at off the road motel run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who lives with his overbearing (oh yeah, and dead) mother.  After Marion is murdered (the classic shower scene) her sister Lila (Vera Miles) and Sam send a detective to find her (they just assume she's missing, run off with the money and all) but what they find is a crazy house of horrors.<br /><br />`Psycho', above all else, succeeds in creating the perfect mood for a film of this nature, giving us enough air of gloom and eerie atmosphere to breathe life to this brilliant film.  Horror movies of today may try, but I highly doubt any film will really come close to what Hitchcock created with `Psycho'.  This film proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that it's that silent sinister feeling that creates real, pure and raw terror, not blood gore and mayhem.</p></body></html>

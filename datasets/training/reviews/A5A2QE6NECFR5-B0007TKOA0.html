Neither Giamatti nor Church played likable characters. The best thing in the film is Virginia Madsen, who was other-worldly radiant as the angel of death in "A Prairie Home Companion" and is realistically radiant here. I had a lot in common with Giamatti's sad-sack broken-hearted failure, and one of my best friends behaves a like lot Thomas Hayden Church's character. Halfway through the film, I was planning to send my copy on to him to see if he agreed that these men were a lot like us. By the end of the movie, I disliked both men so much that I changed my plan, and I'll be donating this DVD to our Friends of the Library book sale in the Spring.</p></body></html>

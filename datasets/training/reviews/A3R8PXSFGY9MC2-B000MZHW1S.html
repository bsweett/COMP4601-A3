<meta name="summary" content="Blood Diamond"></head><body><p>'Blood Diamond' is one of DiCaprios better films and one that leaves you thinking about the issues it explores long after the credits have rolled. All the actors play their roles well and the locations make for some stunning scenery. The storyline is pretty shocking at times and it feels like it is half action movie and half political commentary. The issues around blood diamonds are explained pretty well and it'll make you think twice about those innocuous sparkly stones that we see everywhere. As other reviewers have noted, the film is excellent, but the sanitised, saccharine Hollywood ending spoils what is a powerful film, with an important message. Overall though, I'd say this film is well worth watching, it will keep you engaged the whole way through and is well shot and acted. A directors cut without the last five minutes would be great!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

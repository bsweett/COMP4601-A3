<meta name="summary" content="The dynamic dynamite duo"></head><body><p>Upfront declaration:<br />1) I am a fan of Johnny Cash's music as much as I'll ever be a 'fan' of anything.<br />2) I can't stand biopics.<br /><br />So I went to see this flick following the proddings of my offspring and wife, in the company of said wife.<br /><br />I want to say a few things that I think need to be added, because they were mostly missing from other reviews.<br /><br />The not-so-good-things:<br /><br />The beginning was rather 'bitsy'. Flashbacks to 'youth', meant to serve as exposition and also 'explanation' are very difficult to do, I know. I think they could have been done better. Not necessarily longer or shorter but just 'different'. They had a perfunctory air, like something that had to be gotten over and done with, but was done without much heart. The transition from the thump-thump-thump of the intro to Cash's youth was jarring, instead of stimulating or creating expectancy. It took me some time to recover my bearings and get 'with it' again--and I WAS 'with it' right at the beginning. The sense of things not working persisted for a good half hour into the movie.<br /><br />The second thing was the down-grading of the importance of Cash's first family. Did they ever matter to him at all? According to this script and implementation, not really. I wonder of this doing the situation justice. It certainly demeans Cash's character. Was he really that shallow, indifferent, selfish? I don't know. Who does? But the real question is, did the film makers intend that effect and impression? If so, they succeeded. If not, they screwed up badly.<br /><br />Now for the good things, which is much more fun:<br /><br />I don't think June Carter was quite the cute--though troubled and tough--little munchkin that Witherspoon portrays her as. But I think she and Phoenix managed to pull off very convincingly the love story that is at the heart of all of this. For it's not really about the music, nor about Cash's social conscience or whatever. It's just about a guy who grew up in troubled circumstances, and like all of us had to carry around the baggage through his life. He also had a 'calling', which not so many people have; or if they do they hardly ever listen.<br /><br />He did listen though and went to some lengths to follow it; and got sucked into the maelstrom of money and fame and all that jazz. Matters were made worse by the fact that a) his family, wife and parents alike, didn't really understand what a 'calling' is and how it can drive someone to do very odd things indeed, and b) it just so happened that the one woman marked against his name in the great scheme of life and the universe and everything was basically unattainable--and yet right across the room.<br /><br />Turns out, however, that, when all was said and done, the 'calling' and its fulfillment was empty without the one thing that really mattered. Still, it's not fair to say that June's rejection of him led Cash into drugs and near-ruin. He made some bad decisions, and part of her rejection was occasioned by those, and that in turn made him make more bad decisions. But that's just life. Thing is, in the end--and in reality, too, which makes a nice change--they did get together; and when she died, after 35 years together, he followed her less than half a year later. It's a very touching and romantic story, made even more touching because it isn't made up.<br /><br />The music? What about the music? Well, this is where the film just 'worked'; because the music paced it admirably and was put to very good use to convey emotion where the bracketing narrative sometimes failed. In fact I wish there had been more music and less narrative. The scope of the Cash/Carter repertoire is so wide that they could have added several judiciously-chosen songs and put the point across even more succinctly, especially in the duets.<br /><br />Phoenix and Witherspoon on the stage are dynamite. I know they're not really singers, and they're just imitating/representing a couple of people that actually lived--but there were some moments where I thought "wow; they're actually better than the originals". I know that's heresy, but what the heck! And isn't it really the ultimate tribute to Cash and Carter when the actors go out of their way to make it even better? I know they went to music boot-camp and all that, but so what? Everybody can learn things. Few will take what they've learned and make THIS out of it.<br /><br />I noted the down-playing of the religious angle of the Cash persona. That was a good decision, though I suspect it was taken more for Hollyweirdesque reasons--meaning venal motives--than out of a sense of story-telling integrity. In any case, there was just enough to point it out, but then just as quickly look away and focus on more important things. Way I see this--from an essentially atheist perspective--I think a person is better off, generally speaking, 'finding Jesus' than doing drugs. His chances of being a decent human being are definitely greater. If finding religion--next to finding June--is what it took to set Johnny Cash's life in order, that's fine with me.<br /><br />4/5 stars overall because of the occasionally-confused story line<br />5/5 for Phoenix and Witherspoon<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, CONTINUITY SLIP, SELADIENNA.</p></body></html>

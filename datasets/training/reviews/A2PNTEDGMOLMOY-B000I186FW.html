<meta name="summary" content="Stylish remake of Alan Moore comic offers thrilling sights but little heft"></head><body><p>One of the main enjoyments of Alan Moore's graphic novel, "V for Vendetta," was the sense that it was *about* something.  Moore's visceral contempt for mindless conformity was there on every page, and even though his story had many of the standard "Big Brother" ideas, there were also several unusual and thought-provoking plot developments and ideas.<br /><br />Much of what made "V" such a fantastic graphic novel is absent from this film version, which is presumably why Alan Moore has distanced himself from the movie.  Hugo Weaving is a good choice for the character of V, with his sinister voice and acrobatic body, and Natalie Portman is another good choice as Evey, V's unwilling sidekick and heir apparent.  But these two play their parts in a modified story that is remarkably absent of any emotional heft.<br /><br />The special effects of this movie are astounding, as could be expected from the team that put together the "Matrix" movies.  Mega-explosions are handled expertly, as are several other combat and epic-vista scenes.  But special effects are not enough to push "V" into the class of great action movies.  "V" keeps the viewer at a distance from both V and Evey, even remarkably during Evey's wrenching detention scene.  This scene is the emotional core of the story and brings home the evils of Moore's totalitarian vision, but in this movie it largely feels like a hurried respite between action scenes.<br /><br />For visual appeal, "V" is a five-star production from start to finish.  But like "Van Helsing," "Hulk," or the "Matrix" sequels, "V" cannot be recommended as a great movie (or even a very good one) solely by virtue of its special effects.  At the heart of every great movie - even a great action movie - there must be a great story.  "V" takes what makes the graphic novel a special work and truncates it for blockbuster concerns.  This isn't a bad movie by any means - we're not talking "Speed 2" or "Dune" - but it is a disappointment when the high expectations aren't met.</p></body></html>

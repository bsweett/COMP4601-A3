<meta name="summary" content="Is truly an adult movie"></head><body><p>Bill Murray plays an aging Don Juan who goes looking for an possibly illegitimate son he just found out about about through the mail anonymously. He has a friend who wants to be a detective who writes out a detailed itinerary for the road trip to find his son. Even gets him motel rooms and rental rooms. His ex-women are and interesting bunch. White trash trying to get to middle class status, a aging yuppie into suburban real estate with her husband, an "animal whisperer" and a tough redneck woman.<br /><br />Bill Murray does his role deadpan all the way through through movie but it seems right. If you are patient and open minded you may enjoy this film. It's for mature people who has seen a bit of life.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="We should all be watching the Watchmen"></head><body><p>Watchmen, the film based on the novel of the same name, is one hell of a movie.<br /><br />The film, like the book, tells the story of a super-hero world where there's only one that's super and not that many that are heroic. It's an alternate 1985, where America won the Vietnam War thanks to Doctor Manhattan, the only one of the Watchmen with super powers, and where Richard Nixon was elected to a fifth term. Vigilantes are banned, but that doesn't stop the disturbed, and disturbing, Rorschach, a masked crusader who read Ayn Rand and didn't get the joke.<br /><br />The movie begins with the murder of the Comedian, a former masked hero and US government operative. Rorshach begins investigating that and quickly starts to think there's more than meets the eye, and that someone's out to get the former heroes. Along with his only friend, Nite Owl II, he starts uncovering what might be the largest conspiracy ever.<br /><br />The film is a visual feast of immense proportions (rather like Doctor Manhattan's penis, which you'll see more of than you wanted). The sights up on the screen, particularly on Mars, are stunning, and the effects are nearly perfect, even the most mundane ones. There's a couple shots that I would've sworn were filmed in New York City (the movie was shot in Vancouver).<br /><br />The acting is just as good, especially by Jackie Earle Haley was Rorschach. He's got the voice and the manerisms down pat from the comic. The other roles are rounded out just as well, even those that are people impersonating real historical figures (though Nixon's nose was way too long).<br /><br />As for the script, it was quite good, and though, yes, the ending is changed from the graphic novel, it keeps the overall theme intact and, frankly, works better than the giant squid thingy.<br /><br />Overall this was a very good movie, though not for everyone. Do yourself a favor and go see it while it is still in theatres, cause it will suffer greatly on the small screen.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WARNING!"></head><body><p>WARNING! if you never read the book or have seen documentaries about it and don't really know what its about then you'll be confuse maybe a little and bored like my husband was..It was interesting to me and a little drawn out in some areas of the film honestly i expected a little more action most of the time but it was more about explaining things...I think reviews on this movie will get more 1 & 2 stars because there was so much hype around it  that after you finally see it your not going to feel as excited as you felt going in...<br /><br />The other subject about this is that some reviewers are saying if your a christian or catholic not to see it it lies about Jesus and other stuff even though they know its a fiction, but honestly it tries to prove and show more about Mary Magdalene as Jesus Christ's wife and that a daughter was born and concealed by the Church.<br /><br />My faith is strong enough to see this film and will not change because of the questions being brought up even though its fiction because some people read way too much into it its more looked as what if to me.</p></body></html>

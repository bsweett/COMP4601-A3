<meta name="summary" content="Smelly "Cat""></head><body><p>The Motion Picture Association of Arts & Sciences will be knocking on Halle Berry's front door taking back the Oscar that she was awarded back in 2002, for her role in "Monster's Ball", once "Catwoman" is unleashed in theaters.<p>Pointless film that has nothing to do with the "Batman" villianess of the same name. Berry stars as a woman who loves cats & after a fatal drowning turns into a human cat, complete with superhuman feline prowess. Sharon Stone co-stars as the main villianess, that Berry seeks to claim vengence upon.<p>I've seen the film and it sucks. Big time. It was a bad idea to turn away from the legendary story of Catwoman (Catwoman is a master burglar & overall thief in the "Batman" comics) and try to take a different more mystical, superhero route with it. After "Batman Returns" came out in the summer 1992, it was quite a hot idea to have a spin-off film with the femme feline in her own film. But, with Michelle Pfeiffer passing on the project early on (she was the original Cat in "Batman Returns". She was hot too!) & the death of the Batman franchise, thanks to the stinkie, cheese bomb that is known as "Batman & Robin", who the hell cares !?!<p>Warner Bros. needs to really smarten up stop making garbage like this. <p>Release the hounds, this cat plays in its own litter box.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Few Catty Comments:"></head><body><p>After all of the promotional hype I expected something more from this movie than a catty meow! But I guess comic book subjects aren't rocket science. I just can't understand why Oscar winner Halle Berry would claw her way to the bottom so soon.<br /><br />Catwoman (Halle Berry) rises from the spirit of an ancient cat who breathes new life into a lowly ad-woman. By the light of a full moon Catwoman stalks her prey beginning with ancient jewelry, as a "cat-burglar" and suddenly becoming a crime fighting kitty with heart. Both in and out of costume Catwoman seduces Detective Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) with her feline charms. The bad guys run a cosmetics company that fights the aging but makes one sick in the process. Laurel and George Hedare (Sharon Stone/Lambert Wilson) eventually become Miss Kitty's prey in this predictable tale out of Gotham.<br /><br />This overly done film is pretty much a music video for pretty little Halle Berry to strut her well developed stiff to. So it will always appeal to the easily pleased young male mindset. However it is a disappointment to see such a wonderful actress fall so low in the ranks after winning a well deserved Oscar (for Monster's Ball). The costumes and prowling scenes are posed for the young video game enthusiast. The action shots are obviously computer generated and the cuts between the two are simply horrible. Bratt and Berry are convincing enough as romantic leads but somehow lose their context within this movie. Sharon Stone is the one standout, playing a more than convincing aging menace to society.....and she looks great doing it. If you are a Gotham fan looking for good Catwoman material try Michelle Pfeiffer in the role in Tim Burton's film "Batman Returns" (1992), Pfeiffer does a much better job as the playful kitty. Sadly Halle should stick to what she does best DRAMA and leave the meowing to another litter of up and coming starlets without their reputation at stake.</p></body></html>

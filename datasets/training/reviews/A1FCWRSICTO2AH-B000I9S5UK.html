Granted, Carpenter's retains a certain cheesy charm (see ice cream truck) -- but the passage of time has not been kind, wooden acting, wooden lines, bad hair and low budget.  In contrast the mew Assault has a big budget, has an A-list cast for a B movie. Not a guarantee for success, granted, but director Richet pulls off the remake easily. Carpenter, to be fair, made the most of C-list actors for a B movie. And there are script improvements, with the bad guys as rogue cops rather than Carpenter's voiceless zombie-like gang members (Carpenter's soundtrack was better though). A sucessful remake in every way.</p></body></html>

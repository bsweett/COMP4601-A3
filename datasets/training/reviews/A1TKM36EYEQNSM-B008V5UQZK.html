Funny Greek American interplay is throughout the movie.  Yet anyone who is a second generation American will see the concern on the faces and in the actions of the Greek family for their daughter.<p>The movie is dark and drab at first, a little boring in fact, yet that sets the pace for the movie because you will see the before and after on our star.<p>As with many movies, the WASP family is portrayed as boring, rigid and cold.  Too bad that the son does not speak up on the behalf of his family.  Hey, they are descended from the American farmer, probably.  They tamed this land.<p>However, from the Greek grandma (Ya Ya) to the insanity within the house among the children, it gives a good glimpse of Greek family life.  <p>This is a fun, light hearted movie that has a few tugs at your heart in places.  If you want a good laugh, a good time and a couple of tears, this is a movie for you.  For the family too.</p></body></html>

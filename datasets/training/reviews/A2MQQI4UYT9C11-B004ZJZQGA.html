<meta name="summary" content="Like a F-ing Fairy Tale"></head><body><p>Featuring a crackling script and excellent acting from some unexpected sources (Colin Farrell and Ralph Fiennes, in particular), "In Bruges" is one of the best black comedies I've ever seen and one of my favorite films of 2008.  Farrell plays a young Irish hitman Ray who has botched his first job in London, and is subsequently exiled to Bruges, Belgium with his mentor Ken (Brendan Gleeson) while the heat dies down in London.  Everyone's down about the problem in London - rookie Ray is heartsick over the unnecessary loss of life; veteran Ken is sanguine, but still thinks about how being a hitman will affect his prospects for heaven; Cockney boss Harry (Fiennes) views the whole situation as a matter of honor, at least according to his code.<br /><br />Profanity (more than one "f" word or derivative per minute) and violence abound (particularly in the second half), as does beautiful scenery from the "f-ing" fairy tale city of Bruges, the best-preseved medieval city in Belgium.  But what makes "In Bruges" such a fun film is the script, dialogue and performances - great comic timing by Farrell, world-weariness by Gleeson, startling emotion by the usually drab Fiennes.  His first live scene (after several by mail or phone) is a stunner.  I yelled "yeah, Ralph!".<br /><br />A beautiful drug dealer, an American dwarf actor, a cowardly skinhead, an officious tickettaker at a Bruges landmark, a testy Canadian whom Ray punches out in a case of mistaken identity, and a pregnant, courageous and observant hotelkeeper ("you guys are crazy!") make up a delightful supporting cast.<br /><br />Some viewers will recoil from the realistic violence; others from the pervasive language, but those who dial down their sensibilities a bit will be treated with a hilarious, if twisted, black comedy.</p></body></html>

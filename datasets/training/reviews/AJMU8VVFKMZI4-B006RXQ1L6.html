It was so bold and unlike anything she has ever done and she pulled off successfully.  Not to worry she would eventually get her Oscar the following year.  Ms. Zeta-Jones defintely earned her acclaim as well as Queen Latifiah.  I think John C. Reilly was definitely overlooked in his performance.  High octane and guarantee to make you tap your feet and snap your fingers this film pure entertainment.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

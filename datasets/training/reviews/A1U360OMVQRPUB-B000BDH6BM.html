<meta name="summary" content="Urban Revenge Western"></head><body><p>Evelyn Mercer served as a foster parent for years.  During that time, she only found four children she couldn't place with adoptive parents.  Bobby, Angel, Jerimiah, and Jackie Mercer all lived with Evelyn in her house till they were grown, and she saved them from much harder lives than they would have had.  Bobby is still a hardhead and a fighter.  Angel pulled a stint in the military, but remains a man of violence.  Jerimiah became an upstanding businessman and overextended his grasp.  Jackie was pure rock and roll.  One November night, Evelyn was gunned down in a convenience store.  Her sons come back to Detroit for her funeral and stay for revenge, having to stay one step ahead of the police to get the job done.  While fighting the bad guys, they also have to fight each other and find a way to pull together.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg (INVINCIBLE, THE ITALIAN JOB) plays Bobby Mercer, putting together one of his street-tough roles that he does well.  Tyrese Gibson (2 FAST 2 FURIOUS, ANNAPOLIS) plays Angel.  Andre Benjamin (Outkast) stars as Jerimiah.  Garrett Hedlund (TROY, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS) plays Jack.  Terrence Howard (IDLEWILD, GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN') plays police detective Green.  John Singleton (2 FAST 2 FURIOUS, BABY BOY, SHAFT, BOYZ IN THE HOOD) directed.<br /><br />Definitely leading with an edgy revenge western feel, FOUR BROTHERS stands up, takes names, and kicks butt from the beginning.  The relationship between the four brothers feels real, not forced, and they seem to have a history together.  The pacing keeps the story moving along and introduces enough twists and turns and oddball characters that the viewer doesn't really know how everything is going to turn out.  The revenge motif will get answered, but perhaps not in the way that's expected.  The Detroit surroundings look real, and the chase through the snow was a great bit even though it was ultimately pretty simple.  Enough of the story was hidden to keep the viewer guessing the whole way through.  Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as Victor Sweet and is one of the hardest and most menacing villains on the screen lately.<br /><br />FOUR BROTHERS definitely isn't family fare.  It's more of a good buddy flick and a guy film.  The violence, swearing, and no-holds-barred intensity might jar some viewers who don't expect it, but viewers looking for an action movie with a little something extra will enjoy this one.</p></body></html>

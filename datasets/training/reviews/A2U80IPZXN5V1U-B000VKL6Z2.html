<meta name="summary" content=""Goes deeper into Michael Myers's story""></head><body><p>When Rob Zombie released a remake of the first Halloween movie in 2007 reactions were mixed and many fans of the original couldn't understand why he was making a remake.  This remake is different from the original and Zombie's remake of Halloween came as a total surprise to me; I didn't expect to like it at all and thought that he was going to ruin a classic of horror films. It goes deeper into the original Halloween story which I thought was fascinating and well done, it explains things and gives the movie more depth. I liked how the movie started with Michael Myers as a child and the flashback sequences which explained what just happened as Myers killed members of his family. You see an interview with Myers as a child and the setting is very interesting it tries to explain what happened. Then the movie progresses to the point where he is older and escapes from prison and murders people. There is more gore and everything seems more brutal than in the original which was to be expected and makes it more according to today's standards in horror movies. Some things are different and entertaining and are not an exact copy of the original scene by scene which I thought was well done and creative of Rob Zombie. It's like he took the movie and added things to it and made it his own.<br /><br />Most remakes tend to be pretty bad (even if there are some great ones) and contrary to what many fans thought of Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween I actually enjoyed it and found it was a decent remake. Make no mistake this remake is not as good as the original one and it will never be I just think it was good and that it gave the movie an interesting twist to it. I thought it turned out better than some of the sequels. All I can say is that it's worth watching fans of the original or just curious people.</p></body></html>

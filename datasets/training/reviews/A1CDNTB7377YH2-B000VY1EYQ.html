<meta name="summary" content="Better than Expected!"></head><body><p>I didn't expect much from this film from the start as it was a little bit campy at first but it got better as it went along.  The waitress is actually a woman that works at a pie diner who designs the pie of the day which is based on her feelings.  In some ways this part reminded me of "Like Water For Chocolate" where the food takes over people's emotions.<br /><br />The waitress has a very unhappy life, married to an insensitive bore, who sometimes hits her.  She gets pregnant only because he got her drunk one day.  She doesn't want "his" baby but decides to keep it because she doesn't believe in abortion.<br /><br />She goes to her gynocologist and is surprised to find that she has semi-retired and been replaced by a young male doctor.  Eventually the two of them form a liaison which for some reason reminded me of the wierd relationship in the film "The Secretary."<br /><br />Andy Griffith has a fine supporting role as the owner of the diner who nobody likes.<br /><br />The movie was a little slow to begin but by mid-point it draws you in and ends up being pretty good!</p></body></html>

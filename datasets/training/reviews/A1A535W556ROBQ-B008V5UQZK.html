It never moves past the stereotypes it presents of a large, extended Greek family and the unlucky child to find herself living in the shadow of it.  A dream man (John Corbett) appears and soon Toula is remaking her life, much to the chagrin of her patronizing father. Michael Constatine turns in an amusing performance as the confused father of the bride, trying to figure out why his daughter would marry outside the Greek community, shown in all its kitschy glory.  There are some funny running gags like the heal-all Windex, but the movie barely manages to keep one step of itself, falling back on all too-typical Hollywood trappings to maintain its momentum. This movie left me wishing to see Zorba the Greek again.</p></body></html>

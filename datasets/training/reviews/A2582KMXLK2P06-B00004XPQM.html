<meta name="summary" content="great horror that deserves the many positive ratings and reviews"></head><body><p>The first Final Destination is actually a really good horror film.  It's significantly better than the third Final Destination movie (that's the one with the carnival and roller-coaster ride segment, right?  I like this one a LOT more).<br /><br />The only flaw with this film is that the first 20 minutes start off rather predictable, but give the story some time to develop and I believe you'll find yourself really getting into it.<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, but I found it kind of disrespectful that they'd keep playing John Denver's classic "Rocky Mountain High" throughout the film.  The song plays whenever something bad is about to happen.<br /><br />It's disrespectful because, as you probably know, John Denver lost his life in an airplane accident a few years before this movie was created and released.  The writers should have honestly picked a different song.<br /><br />Now about the storyline.  Are you the kind of person that believes you can cheat death?  If so, do you believe if you happen to cheat death that death will rear its head shortly after in ANOTHER attempt to take your life?  These are the kind of serious and curious questions that many of us probably ask ourselves, and these same questions are the reason this kind of horror is a few steps above the generic slasher kind (and honestly, slasher flicks are the kind of horror stories have been done to the point of exhaustion by this point).<br /><br />I often wonder about these questions personally, though obviously it's important not to let these questions interfere with enjoying your life.  But it makes you wonder exactly what your destiny is and when it will happen, doesn't it?<br /><br />Anyway, great horror suspense.</p></body></html>

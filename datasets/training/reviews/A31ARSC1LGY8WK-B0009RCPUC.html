<meta name="summary" content="Remarkable film chronicling the last days of Hitler"></head><body><p>Superb film set in and around Hitler's bunker in the last few weeks before the capitulation of Germany in WWII - seen through the eyes of Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge.<br />Bruno Ganz is superb in the role of the Nazi leader - brilliantly portraying Hitler's wild mood swings and increasing detachment from reality. An altogether remarkable film exploring a remarkable moment in history.<br /><br />The book "Until the Final Hour" by Traudl Junge and Melissa Muller is also available through Amazon.com as is the documentary "Blind Spot - Hitler's Secretary", which features extensive interviews with her.</p></body></html>

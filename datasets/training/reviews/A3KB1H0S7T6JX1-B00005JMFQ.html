<meta name="summary" content="AMAZING!!!"></head><body><p>Definitely a great movie and one of my personal favorites, Love Actually, brings to the screen a set of stories that take place in London, England, involving an unlikely group of people who are linked to each other in varying ways.  The list of top quality actors taking part in this film is very long!  All the actors' performances are outstanding; their great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing a film that can be watched over and over again.<br /><br />The plot is very witty, very well thought through, and fantastically executed.<br /><br />But that is not the only thing that puts this movie at the very top; it combines excellent comedy, realistic drama (for a change), and the music is such an asset (!!!), making this movie one of the best of its kind.<br /><br />After Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral, Richard Curtis has scored another major hit with this movie! In short, Love Actually is a movie guaranteed to make you both laugh and cry, and in the end leave you with the warmest feelings of joy!  I for one would definitely line up to watch a sequel!</p></body></html>

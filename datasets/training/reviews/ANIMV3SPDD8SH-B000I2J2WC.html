<meta name="summary" content="THE DA VINCI LOAD"></head><body><p>It just barely manages to stay afloat as an action packed thriller, and you've got to ask yourself, just where did all the mega-millions poured into this film go? Besides it's promotion, that is. Like it's art history subject matter, I expected a cinematic canvas of depth and beauty, but this is more like standard action fare, as Ron Howard's generic and hurried direction rushes by like he's filming NASCAR and throwing a rude mustache on the Mona Lisa. It breathes like a lesser James Bond film, with lots of facial concentrations, typical car crash and shoot 'em up violence, and so much conversation, at times they may as well be reading aloud from the book. Unlike the book, (I suppose), it is more indebted to the action genre than it is art history, even the spliced flashback images of ancient times seems more an homage to Cecil B. DeMille, than it is true history. Tom Hanks never quite grips the role of an ancient symbols expert thrown into a diabolical plot, his security and knowledge of the subject matter is aloof and increasingly dissipates as the film progresses, like you expect him to moronically and unknowingly burst, "Hey, this is some heavy stuff!", at any moment. Audrey Tatou's role as a student of cryptic analysis, is reduced to what seems a dull investigative reporter, full of routine questions, and duly surprised reaction that only serve as springboards for the film to delve into a facts and legends expose. Picture a big budget History Channel on Halloween night. There's also a grueling sort of half-hearted glibness at mention of what seems controversial subjects; The Pope, Catholics, a blood line French family, as if the film smugly retains a secret it yet shares with its audience, and a ridiculously indulgent line uttered by Hanks at the height of action; "I've got to get to a library!", that suggests to the audience to look it up themselves if the film falls short of total explanation. I'm googling Rosalind as I speak.  The Da Vinci Code is an amazingly conventional and second rate thriller. But is it art?</p></body></html>

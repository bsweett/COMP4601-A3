<meta name="summary" content="Incredibly dissapointed"></head><body><p>The 5th Harry Potter book is my favorite and I was extremely excited about the movie and prayed that the director wouldnt screw it up. So now, months after seeing a midnight showing, I am still in utter shock. I dont WANT to hate this movie because it is Harry Potter after all. But I cant but cringe whenever I think about it. Basically, they turned the longest book into the shortest movie. Appalling, horrendous, wrong. It was like a ridiculously abridged version of Order of the Phoenix. People around me in the theater were also aware of this as scenes jarred from one to another without flow or reason. If you have never read the book, you probably wound't notice just how much they cut out. Or changed. The changes were awful and unfortunetely, certain aspects that they either changed or left out are crucial to the final book. So I dont understand the reasoning. I could go on and on but I dont want to relive it..<br />The one plus I do have is that the acting dramatically improved by the younger actors. I did notice it right away and am glad of that anyway. Oh and Umbridge was spot on. Well! Thats about it, really. I now have doubts about the 6th movie, being made by the same director and all...We shall see.<br /><br />Oh, also, the deleted scenes on the dvd are absolutely pointless. I mean, not 1 has any merit or importance to it. I at least hoped those would help out the movie in some way, but no, they sure didnt. I gave it 3 stars because although I dont hate the movie per se, I am quite dissapointed about it, and well, if you're a Harry Potter fan, you cant really hate it.</p></body></html>

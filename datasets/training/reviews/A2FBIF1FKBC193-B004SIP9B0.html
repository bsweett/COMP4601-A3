<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly it's a fabulous 'twofer' ........."></head><body><p>Ok .... trust me .. to make the 'nutter' royal family seem even slightly interesting or symapthetic is a a challenge to say the least....<br /><br />I KNOW that when Diana died the COLD BLOODED SHREW of a Queen was upset at her vacation  being interrupted with the funeral arrangements that nothing but homosexuals and glitterati would attend, Elton John was mentioned, not a single tear was shed. Matter of fact the movie portrays that Queen Elizabeth was more dismayed at a 14 point stag being killed on her Balmoral estate by a commercial 'stock broker' hunter, than the violent death of her ex-daughter-in-law!<br /><br />Matter of fact this COLD BLOODED SHREW of a Queen, I know I should let you know how I really feel, could not shed a singe tear for Diana she was practically catatonic and weeping like Niagara when the British Navy retired her damned royal yacht the 'Brittanica' ... I saw it in the flesh!<br /><br />Helen Mirren portrayed Queen Liz ... well fabulous is an understatement! She did deserve and academy award...<br /><br />Now the twofer was Micheal Sheen .... no no not one of the US Sheen family ... google it OK ... who played Tony Blair. Most certainly along with Mirren he is central in this movie and should also have won Academy accolades. Micheal Sheen won awards for the London stage play 'Amadeus' and has appeared in an ecclectic group of flicks such as 'The Four Feathers', 'The Kingdom of Heaven', and 'Blood Diamond'.<br /><br />Nuff said .. it's a twofer !!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""I just want him to lose what matters most to him""></head><body><p>I am one of those people that absolutely loved <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000062XHI">Ocean's Eleven</a> and was extremely disappointed by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007P0XBO">Ocean's Twelve</a>, not because the movie was all that bad, but because it could not even compare to the first one. I am happy to report that this new film comes much closer in quality to the earlier effort, and thus, is another winner. The elements are all there, a highly entertaining storyline, plenty of funny moments, a cleverly planned revenge and an impressive cast.<br /><br />There are a few differences this time around though. The plan involves destroying the empire of Willie Bank (Al Pacino), a ruthless casino mogul, who cheated Reuben out of his share of the hotel they were planning to open together. In turn, Reuben lost his will for living and is in a life-threatening state. The crew wants their revenge and to provide Reuben a reason for going on with his life. Therefore, this is a plan that involves no personal profit, well maybe just a little, but mostly the goal is to punish Bank. Another difference is that sadly, Julia Roberts is not present this time around. Finally, did you ever think that Danny Ocean and his friends will work together with Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia)? I didn't either, so brace yourself for a shock!<br /><br />From cheating at the casino, to initiating a revolt among laborers in Mexico, this movie has it all. The ingredients for having a great time are all present, and mixed in the right formula. The cast does an impressive job and the addition of Al Pacino, with an excellent performance, contributes to the overall quality of the final product. Fans of Danny and his team will not be disappointed!</p></body></html>

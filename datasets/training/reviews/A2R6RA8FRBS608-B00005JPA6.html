Despite the fact that the Spanish Civil War is over, rebels still fight in the countryside against the Fascists and Captain Vidal runs a military outpost to eliminate his enemies.<br /><br />The stress of this remarkably brutal and hostile world proves too much for young Ofelia; and she eventually escapes into a world of fantasy. In this world, based partly on a real live labyrinth near the military camp, Ofelia pretends (or believes) that a faun (Doug Jones) will give her three increasingly dangerous tasks to perform. If she succeeds, she will be rewarded by the faun: She will return to her rightful place as a princess in an underground world where she will be loved by her people and life is much more pleasant, to say the least.<br /><br />The plot progresses at a good pace. As real life becomes more and more challenging and stressful, so do the imaginary tasks Ofelia must perform in order to become worthy of entering the world of paradise where she will live forever as a princess.<br /><br />There won't be any plot spoilers here; but I must warn you of this: Pan's Labyrinth is no movie for squeamish people. The events and scenes are quite candid and the spoken lines are as honest and direct as people would have spoken them at the time these real life events occurred. We see many murders and there are several particularly grisly scenes with more blood in them than my community hospital keeps in storage! I briefly closed my eyes once or twice, admittedly, but I kept watching because the film proves itself to be nothing less than a masterful tour de force by all involved and a true work of fine art. The actors portray their characters very convincingly; and the choreography shines in the battle scenes in particular. Look also for a fine performance by Ofelia's only friend besides her mother, the sweet housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verd&uacute;).<br /><br />The DVD comes with a few extras including a commentary with the director (Guillermo del Toro) and an interactive feature that sheds extra light on the making of this fine motion picture.<br /><br />In short, Pan's Labyrinth is an excellent work of fine art that we should watch and watch again for the pleasure of seeing a film that is truly top quality art. I highly recommend Pans Labyrinth for adults--and the children within us--who want to experience a film of grand proportions. Pans Labyrinth takes a serious subject and does it justice with painstaking work on the part of all who worked on it. Don't pass by this superlative motion picture--Pan's Labyrinth is more than worth its weight in gold.</p></body></html>

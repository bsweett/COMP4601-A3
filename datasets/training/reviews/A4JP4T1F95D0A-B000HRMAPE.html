It is certainly more than your average Arnold picture in the way of plot, but at the core it is a popcorn movie.  Though there are twists and turns, this one is less confusing than the first film.  Much of the technology is improbable, but you have to suspend a little belief.  I mean, yes people can make lifelike masks, and if given time can make a person resemble another.  But there is no machine that can make an exact copy in less than a minute.  Cruise is good in his usual charming way.  Hoffman is great, and I would have loved to see more of him.  The movie is a worthy addition to the franchise, and it is a shame it did not do better.  I would certainly like to see a 4th.</p></body></html>

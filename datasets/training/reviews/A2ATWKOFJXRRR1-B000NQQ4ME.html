<meta name="summary" content="Love Him Or Hate Him, Gibson Knows Cinema"></head><body><p>Love him or loathe him, Mel Gibson can make some damn good movies. BRAVEHEART was wonderfully brutal, which Gibson produced, directed and starred in. Now fully behind the camera in his latest two feature films, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST and now APOCALYPTO, Gibson proves he's got both vision and talent (now if he could only keep his personal life out of the tabloids!)<br /><br />Because of Mel's idiotic comments of late, many have seen fit (perhaps rightfully so) to boycott his films. I know I avoided seeing this one until it came out on DVD, a mini-boycott on my part for Mr. Gibson's poor politics and social skills. But the visuals on the trailers kept beckoning me to check out Apocalypto, and so I finally broke down and rented it.<br /><br />It is noteworthy here to say that Mel, regardless of subject matter, can pull viewers into a story. Although The Passion had its anti-Jewish components, it was sumptuously filmed and very well executed. If we're here to talk about films and not the man behind the film, then it's fair to say that Apocalypto is a rousing success.<br /><br />The sets, the dress, the make-up, the incredible story, and the action, all make this film a glue-yourself-to-the-screen experience. Not once did I pull my eyes from the movie, fearing that I might miss this beautiful shot or that amazing character.<br /><br />***SPOILER WARNING***<br /><br />The story is about Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), the future leader of a small band of people that live on the outskirts of the great Mayan culture. He has an ideal life, a loving wife, a tough son, and another kid "in the oven." He and his fellow townsfolk hunt the local forest for food and live in harmony with their environment. Until one day he and his tribe are ripped apart by beastly slave-gatherers. Realizing that he must hide his pregnant wife and son, Jaguar Paw lowers them into a deep pit for safe keeping during the slave runners attack. Caught, bound, and forced to march miles, Jaguar Paw and his tribesmen are brought to a great Mayan temple where they are to be sacrificed. But as Jaguar Paw's turn comes, a solar eclipse occurs and Jaguar and his remaining band are spared a barbarous beheading.<br /><br />But it ain't over yet.<br /><br />Taken to an open stadium, he and his surviving tribesfolk are told to run toward a field of corn as spears, rocks and other projectiles are hurled at them. At the end of the path, too, is a "finisher", the son of the head slave trader who kills off any of those who are wounded. Jaguar Paw, desperate to get back to his wife and child, kills the young finisher and escapes into the jungle. But the king of the slave-gatherers wants Jaguar Paw's blood for killing his son. And thus starts an adrenaline pumping chase through the thick jungle, over massive waterfalls, and deep into Jaguar Paw's country. Not only is Jaguar Paw running from the slave men, he's also running toward his beloved wife and kid in a race to save them before they either starve to death, get injured, or are drowned by flash-flood rains.<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />It is amazing that none of the main actors, supporting actors, or extras have any previous film history (at least not any significant history, really), yet they all played their parts perfectly. Much praise MUST (reluctantly or not) go toward Mr. Gibson for his amazing job directing this genre-busting thrill ride. Not only is it a pseudo-historical piece, but it also has heavy elements of romance, drama, comedy, and action/adventure. Rolling all of those concepts into one film is often impossible, but Apocalypto isn't forced nor overly drawn. It completely lures you in, including the Mayan language which is spoken throughout the entire production (with English subtitles).<br /><br />The make-up consisted of nearly 70 artists who had to re-tattoo each of the 700 main and extra characters daily, a monumental task. And costume designer Mayes C. Rubeo (BORN ON THE 4TH OF JULY) is to be commended for her outstanding head-dresses and eye to detail (I feel she was cheated out of an Academy Award nomination due to this film's affiliation with Mr. Gibson).<br /><br />So if you're thinking about watching this but don't like Mel Gibson personally, I totally understand. But you might try it anyway. It is one fantastic piece of cinema.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fincher's "Zodiac" riveting but we get a bare bones DVD-Director's Cut will have extras"></head><body><p>On July 4th, 1969 I was lighting firecrackers in Vallejo, California 6 miles away from where the second Zodiac murder took place. It was a difficult time-the Summer of Love along the Haight-Ashbury district had degenerated into a hazy wash of drug dealers peddling to Hippies that were descending into junkies and Vallejo, California the town best known for the Naval Base Mare Island and the city where Raymond Burr was raised had a reputation as a quiet town so our parents were shocked when news of the murder rocked the town. It wasn't the first murder in Vallejo but it was the unusual nature of the murder itself; the killer who called himself the Zodiac mailed ciphers to the San Francisco Chronicle, Examiner and the Vallejo Times-Herald threatening to go on a killer spree unless the newspapers published his ciphers. He then taunted the police and FBI in the Bay Area to try and figure out his identity as he killed more people. My brothers were teenagers at the time and as further news of the Zodiac's body count increased my parents were more nervous about what would happen to my brothers after dark than whether or not they were remembering to use rubbers.<br /><br />David Fincher's new film captures that nervous time extremely well in his new film "Zodiac". Based on the book by former Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith, the film covers those obsessed with catching the killer as well as the killer's deeds themselves. Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) obsesses over the killer, his use of cryptology to communicate. Graysmith becomes involved with the police officer (Mark Ruffalo) and the writer (Robert Downey Jr. who gives a perfect performance) covering the case for the Chronicle. Slowly Grarysmith finds that the Zodiac takes over his life and he becomes more focused with finding the man behind the mask and letters as the police gradually give up on the case. With marvelous supporting performances from Anthony Edwards, Chloe Sevigny, Brian Cox, Fincher injects a film that could have faltered because of the large time span and the fact that the outcome is known (there was a suspect identified but the police didn't have enough evidence until much too late) into a riveting if flawed film.<br /><br />All the signs are here for a solid transfer from Paramount-accurate flesh tones and a crisp looking presentation with solid blacks. The audio is nicely used creating an environment that will creep you out if you listen to it in 5.1 with its use of ambient effects. Shot with HD video camera, the image does look a bit murky during some of the darker scenes but overall looks quite good.<br /><br />This edition is bare bones and comes only with previews/trailers for other films. One of the trailers though does advertise for a two disc deluxe set that will have extensive extras on the film and the case. I'd suggest waiting for that deluxe edition and renting this edition.<br /><br />A terrific film from director David Fincher receives a nice looking presentation that has a major flaw-no extras or commentary tracks. There will be a deluxe edition later in early 2008. I'd suggest waiting for that edition and renting this in the meantime.</p></body></html>

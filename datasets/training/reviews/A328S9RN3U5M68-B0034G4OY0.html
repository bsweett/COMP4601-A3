If that meaning comes at the point of death then that is at least something to comfort us.  HEREAFTER is a thinking man's film from Clint Eastwood, a film that carries his trademark concern for human communication to a new level,  And it works.<br /><br />George Lonegan (Matt Damon) had an experience as a child with encephalomyelitis that left him with the ability to communicate with the dead -a psychic.  After some years of using this as a profession (with the aid of his brother Billy - Jay Mohr) he has given up this disturbing 'curse' and become a construction worker. Billy pleads with him to continue as a psychic but George is too disturbed by his talent and seeks peace.  Simultaneously we are introduced to a French TV journalist Marie Lelay (C&eacute;cile De France) and her boyfriend Didier (Thierry Neuvic) as the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami destroys their vacation and Marie is drowned for a while - but revives: the experience  changes her outlook and she takes a break form her Parisian YTV job to write  a book about her hereafter experience. And simultaneously the brothers Marcus and Jason (Frankie and George McLaren) try to keep their drug addicted mother whole and Jason is accidentally killed: Marcus is devastated by the loss of his brother and by the fact that he is to be placed in a foster home. These three people's lives intersect in a course of events that lands them each in London and their shared belief in the hereafter is what manages to bring them a semblance of sanity, despite the world's negative opinion of their beliefs.<br /><br />Peter Morgan  ('The Queen', 'Longford', 'Frost/Nixon', 'The Other Boleyn Girl', etc) wrote this absorbing tale and Clint Eastwood directs with a true flair for the subject matter.  The special effects are extraordinarily well done, especially the underwater sequences.  Damon and the beautiful and talented C&eacute;cile De France are excellent in their roles as are the boys who play the brothers  and the cameos by such luminaries as Derek Jacoby, Marthe Keller, Steve Schirripa, and Bryce Dallas Howard.  Though the music score is attributed to Clint Eastwood, for the most part the music is provided by excerpts form Rachmaninov's 2nd Piano Concerto!  The film goes on a bit long (over 2 hours) but the twists and turns of the action keep it well worth watching.  Grady Harp, March 11</p></body></html>

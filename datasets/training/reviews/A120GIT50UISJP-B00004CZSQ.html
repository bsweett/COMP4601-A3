<meta name="summary" content="An Argento masterpiece; fans should seek out the 25th Anniversary Edition"></head><body><p>Considered one of Dario Argento's best, most suspenseful and most beautiful films. Suzy Bannon [Jessica Harper] arrives in Munich to attend one of the foremost dance academies in the world. But the dance academy has a dark past, a history of dabbling in the black arts, and some of the students think the teachers may still be involved in these nefarious activities. Suzy is the antidote to the evil that has seeped into the school over the centuries, but it will take skill and determination to pierce the innermost walls and secrets of the school. With its over-the-top Art Nouveau sets and Argento's signature use of primary colors, Suspiria is like being a voyeur is someone else's nightmare.<br /><br />The 25th Anniversary edition contains two discs of additional material which will be of interest to any Argento fan; those who are not fanatical about Suspiria will enjoy the less expensive, more readily available standard release.</p></body></html>

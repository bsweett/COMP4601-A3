<meta name="summary" content="What Lies Beneath  (2000)"></head><body><p>Director:  Robert Zemeckis<br /><br />Cast:  Harrison Ford, Michelle Pfeiffer, Diana Scarwid, Joe Morton, James Remar, Miranda Otto, Amber Valletta, Katherine Towne, Victoria Bidewell.<br /><br />Running Time:  130 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for terror/violence, sensuality and brief language.<br /><br />"What Lies Beneath" borrows heavily from movies like "Rebecca" and "Psycho", adding generous helpings of "Rear Window" and "Wait Until Dark" to the mix for good measure.  Claire (Pfeiffer) and Norman (Ford) are a well-to-do married couple living on a somewhat palacial lakeside estate in Vermont. Norman's a research scientist and spends much of his time finishing papers and giving lectures while Claire stays at home, dealing with the emotional aftereffects of a recent car crash.  Norman has a stepdaughter, Caitlin, who goes off to college at the beginning of the movie. For the first time in years, Claire is alone in the house, and she notices strange things afoot. She experiences some strange phenomena, including a woman's reflection in her bathwater. The fragile Claire is convinced the disturbances have something to do with the strange couple next door, and urges her husband to look into the matter. He finds nothing, of course, and asks her to see a therapist, thinking that his lovely wife is still unstable, but the therapist recommends contacting whatever might be causing the disturbances, and that's when the fun begins.<br /><br />It's ironic that a movie be entitled "What Lies Beneath" when it is so shallow. This picture is typical Hitchcock suspense with plenty of creaks and jumps and `look behind you' scenes, but there aren't enough full on scare sequences and much of these are just overused clich&eacute;s. Director Robert Zemeckis ("Back to the Future", "Forrest Gump") is clearly having a blast behind the camera and successfully masters yet another genre. He puts a tremendous deal of skill into the proceedings; however, there simply isn't enough material to work with. The film uneasily balances between domestic drama, supernatural chiller and all-out thriller, and the three sub-genres simply don't gel.  As the neurotic housewife, Michelle Pfeiffer is perfectly cast and brings depth to her first good role in a long time and holds her own against the more popular Harrison Ford, who curiously avoids the limelight for most of the movie.  As soon as the emotional hokum gets going, the film loses a good deal of momentum, but the shear suspense of it all is what keeps `What Lies Beneath' going. But with the uneasy mixture, the bogeyman material seems out of place when in tone with the thriller aspect. While it is very slow-paced, Zemeckis and Pfeiffer make a deadly combo and almost overcome the bogging down of sentimentality and a slightly shallow script. Eerie, creepy and surprising, "What Lies Beneath" is flawed, but generally a sophisticated thriller that is still better than most of the modernized, teenie-bopping trash that Hollywood sends out these days.</p></body></html>

Needless to say, I was intrigued by both MIKE MIGNOLA's cool artwork and the spiffy trailer.  The film turned out to be slightly dissapointing.  Not a bad flick, HELLBOY does have decent FX and some interesting characters, however the movie is lacking a flowing plot that takes away from what could've been a cool story.  RON PEARLMAN looks great, but the weak script gives him nothing but cheesy, cliched dialogue.  It's a shame to cast an enigmatic actor like him in the lead and give him so little to work with.  The rest of the characters work fairly the same.  Half fish-half man ABE SAPIEN is about the coolest thing in the film, but all but dissapears halfway through.  There were many elements without full explaination prevalent throughout the picture, which leads one to believe that the comic is much more in-depth than you can adapt to the big screen.  Director GUILLERMO DEL TORO has a great eye, but doesn't know how to bridge together a script with holes.  HELLBOY simply lacks the true engagement of a good yarn.  Which is too bad really, because everything about the production pointed to a hell of a good movie watching experience.</p></body></html>

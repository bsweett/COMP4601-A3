<meta name="summary" content="In deep shist"></head><body><p>Trevor: Hey, look at all the shist.<br />Sean: What?<br />Trevor: It's a metamorphic rock. Green shist, white shist, micro-guarded shist-<br />Sean: Oh. Shist.<br /><br />This adaptation of the Jules Verne classic novel features Trevor, a goofy volcanologist (Brendan Fraser), his nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and Hannah, a canny Icelandic tour guide (Anita Briem).<br /><br />While on a hastily arranged expedition to Iceland to retrieve data from a previously dormant volcanic sensor gadget, the trio emulates Alice by falling down a hole.  Curiouser and curiouser, they end up not in Wonderland, but in a lost world, where long-extinct phosphorescent birds flutter by and the flying fish have a serious case of overbite.<br /><br />Using the storyline of a missing brother and misunderstood Vernian volcanologists, the little group wanders around the treacherous terrain, overcoming insurmountable odds and horrible hardship (Eat your Trilobite, Sean) before reaching the grandly preposterous finale.<br /><br />Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1. Three down the shist hole<br />2. Things start heating up<br />3. Underground ocean crossing brings separation anxiety<br />4. Tyrannosaurus wrecks<br />5. Geyser erupts with "flare"<br />6. Strong hint of "to be continued"<br /><br />A little Goonies, a little Indiana Jones and a lot of tongue-in-cheek adventure, this movie is great as far as light entertainment goes, and can be viewed by the whole family.<br /><br />[Warning: Beware of lame lines and ridiculous situations.]<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 29, 2008</p></body></html>

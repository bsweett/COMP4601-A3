I remember in the early 70s a movie called "Planet of the Apes" came out and was highly regarded by some critics. Well, the whole premise was just nonsense any way you looked at it. But it seemed to get high marks and even won an Oscar. Well, who knows what will win an Oscar. In any case, it was a highly acclaimed science fiction movie and had a lot of followup movies. Go figure.<br /><br />Well, I spotted "Planet of the Apes" on the 5-dollar Wal-Mart bargain rack and dropped it into the cart. Last night I viewed it. Just as I figured in the early 70s, this thing was just pure nonsense in every way. The setting didn't look like another planet at all. It looked like the Colorado Plateau and the "lake" was one of the large reservoirs. Trust me.The story was more of a comedy than serious science fiction. Well, I'm probably too critical and it was rather entertaining viewing. Nonsense, but entertaining nonsense I suppose you might say.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

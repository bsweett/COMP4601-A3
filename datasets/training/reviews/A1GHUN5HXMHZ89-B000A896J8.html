<meta name="summary" content="Gladiator caliber"></head><body><p>This is an excellent movie with good casting, story, special effects, camera work, music, and sets. If you enjoy movies like Gladiator, The 13th Warrior, Troy, Robin Hood, et cetera you will probably enjoy this movie. Our main character played by Bloom finds himself in a ackward predicament in protecting the crown and being infatuated with a beautiful young lady. A great deal of epic battle scenes, knightly honor, and court intrigue make this well worth a look. It may not have been a big hit at the box office, but it certainly merits at least a rental. I didn't catch it at the theater, but after renting it I ended up buying it.</p></body></html>

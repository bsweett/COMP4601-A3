<meta name="summary" content="Premonition privy to plot holes"></head><body><p>There is a skit in the animated program Robot Chicken where a caricature of M. Night Shaymalyn keeps shouting "what a twist" when we see little parodies of his films.  This is a poignant piece because it hints at one of the major problems in a post 6th Sense Hollywood, where filmakers feel they can woo in audiences with surprise endings and twists and turns throughout the story.<br /><br />In films like the 6th Sense, such a device is good.  But that was a carefully laid twist that didn't confuse filmgoers and the director carefully gave you little snippets of the clues that led to the conclusion.  It's an easy to digest 'twist.'  It does not work in a film like Premonition, where the twists and turns contradict logic and further confuse filmgoers.<br /><br />Premonition begins where Bullock plays a happily homebound housewife who has two children.  She takes the children to school, goes about her daily chores, listens to a voice message from her husband (where plot holes begin - I'll get to that later), and then receives the disturbing news that her husband is dead.  Next day, surprise, he's alive - it must have all been a dream because he's alive and it's a few days before the accident.  Next day (for Bullock's character anyway), it's the funeral, oh and there's a really unintentionally funny scene where she attempts to check out the casket!  Well it ends up being a lot of going back and forth and the filmakers allude that some of the things that occur must be real, but wait, if this was true, then that first day her daughter should've had scars..and didn't she end up going to a mental institution....does this sound confusing to you?  It's how the film operates.  And no - none of it makes sense.<br /><br />Films dealing with time travel or telling the future in any sort of way must set up rules that the audience can follow - or at least let us in on any known incosistencies ala Back to the Future.  This film does neither and leaves the audience wondering "huh?"  To further muddy the waters, this film has a number of unresolved subplots, including an aformenetioned scene involving her losing her children and getting commited and an alleged affair her husband may have been having.  As for the plot holes (Here be a spoiler), listen closely to the phone call from the husband in the beginning and hear it repeated towards the end.  Something's wrong.<br /><br />This film is not recommended.  I swear I have never been more upset and infuriated after watching a movie.  I don't normally rant on films like this, but films of this low quality, robbed of any logic should be avoided.  If the film is recut into some Lifetime movie or even further into a twilight zone episode, it might have some value.  But 100 minutes could be used alot more wisely than watching this jumbled psychic/time travel boggle of a film.</p></body></html>

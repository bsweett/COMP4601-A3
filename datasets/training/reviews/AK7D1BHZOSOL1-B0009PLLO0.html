<meta name="summary" content="The Actors did their best..."></head><body><p>Unfortunatly their best was not nearly good enough, think all of the worst elements of Troy and then multiply them by a factor of 10.  I have nothing against gay people but there is a really creepy homosexual undertone here that starts at the beginning and stays with us to the end.  I am a student of history and am therefore not ignorant of Greek social practices but the issue of Alexander's Homosexuality should have been a side peaice and not a main focus point for this movie.  Very little redeems this movie in my eyes, well maybe one excellent sequence but no more then that.  Why sit for 2 and ? hours for one good battle when you can just rent Lord of the Rings?<br /><br />I would never sit through it again, nor buy it on DVD.<br /><br />The actors performed well most notably Sean Bean and Anthony Hopkins but the movie itself felt undeveloped in a major way, you can't except an actor to do his or her job if the script just sucks.  Oliver Stone took what had the elements to be a wonderful movie and turned it into some sort of a love story interspersed with long boring speeches.</p></body></html>

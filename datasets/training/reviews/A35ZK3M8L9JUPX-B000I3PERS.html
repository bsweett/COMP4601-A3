<meta name="summary" content="Braveheart"></head><body><p>William Wallace is a Scottish rebel who leads an uprising against the cruel English ruler Edward the Longshanks, who wishes to inherit the crown of Scotland for himself. When he was a young boy, William Wallace's father and brother, along with many others, lost their lives trying to free Scotland. Once he loses another of his loved ones, William Wallace begins his long quest to make Scotland free once and for all, along with the assistance of Robert the Bruce. A vastly entertaining and powerful movie. Braveheart is a truely epic film, it stands out as one of the top overall movies ever in my mind. The story is top-notch, the direction and acting/cast are equally great as well.</p></body></html>

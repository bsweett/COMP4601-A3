<meta name="summary" content="Austin at Mid-Life Crisis"></head><body><p>It's apparent from this film that Mike Myers is growing tired of the Austin Powers character.  However, there is still plenty of gas left in Dr. Evil's tank.  The partnership between Dr. Evil and Mini-Me(Vern Troyer) is still a laugh riot.  The film introduces neglectful daddy issues i.e. Austin's daddy (Michael Caine) always ignored him and Scott(Seth Green) is still trying to impress Dr. Evil.  Caine is reasonably funny here.  Beyonce Knowles is charming as Foxxy Cleopatra.  The opening scene of the film is classic with surprise cameos.  To the film's detriment the Goldmember character is just gross.  And more than the other films, Myers relies on too much toilet humor.</p></body></html>

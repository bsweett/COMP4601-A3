<meta name="summary" content="Oscar Winning Sports Film from Clint Eastwood"></head><body><p>Million Dollar Baby is a multi- Oscar winning film directed by and starring Hollywood veteran Clint Eastwood. This film follows a young woman who pursues her dream to make it big in the sport of boxing and achieves a great deal of success with Eastwood as her trainer.<br /><br />Eastwood directed this movie and he produces a winning formula on all counts. The main plot of this film involves a young woman who wants to become a champion boxer and wants Eastwood's character to be her trainer. There is also a subtle but important subplot involving the family lives of Eastwood and Swank. Both have problems with family members and they are both missing some important relationships in their lives. And in the end, they each fulfill the others relationship gap.<br /><br />This movie is well- directed, well- produced, and superbly acted. The standouts in the acting department include Hilary Swank in the role as Maggie; Morgan Freeman in the role as former boxer Eddie Dupris; and Eastwood himself in the role as Frankie Dunn. Swank's character is most memorable and the strength of her hard- nosed, yet friendly character won her an Oscar. Eastwood and Freeman's character provide some good contrast. They are different in their approach to boxing and their philosophy on success. They both love the sport they teach, but they approach it from different angles. Freeman captured the Oscar for his performance and Eastwood received a nomination.<br /><br />Yet another plus for this film is its lack of predictability. Sports films are, for the most part, easy to predict after a few minutes. You can usually tell which team or individual is going to reign victorious in the end. Sometimes, the predictable nature of sports movies lessens their appeal; other times, it doesn't matter. But in this movie, there isn't as much predictability and some of the turns of events will leave viewers surprised.<br /><br />Narrated by Morgan Freeman's character, Million Dollar Baby is a winning motion picture about life, victory, achievement, and loss. Its winning formula made it an excellent choice for the Best Picture Oscar in 2004. If you haven't already seen it, I recommend doing so immediately. It's a great film from Clint Eastwood.</p></body></html>

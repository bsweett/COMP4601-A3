<meta name="summary" content="Meryl Streep's performance is a must see"></head><body><p>The same night I watched this movie I was channel flipping and came across "Out of Africa" from 1985.  It starred Meryl Streep and Robert Redford.  I'd seen the movie before but watched several minutes out of comparative curiosity.  Meryl plays a headstrong Danish baroness/plantation owner in colonial Kenya.  She speaks English with what appears to be a perfect Danish accent.  The woman is remarkable which is also the correct adjective for her role as British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.  If not for her performance this film can easily be overlooked and would feel right at home on basic cable.<br /><br />While Thatcher's rise to power as the first woman prime minister is quite an accomplishment, it doesn't seem to be terribly interesting.  One of the problems is that the meat of her career doesn't begin until she's in her 20's.  There isn't much about her childhood.  All of this comes as the aging, depressed woman teeters on the edge of dementia.  It is those uncomfortable moments we get too much of.  Thatcher's life story would have played better with linear story telling but then we wouldn't have seen so much of the well done make-up artistry and Streep's well played old lady.  Was that the filmmaker's goal?<br /><br />It's too bad the story, style and script don't meet the standard established by Ms. Streep and the excellent video transfer.  Projected in a wide 2.35:1 aspect ratio in 1080p the film looks great.  Likewise the DTS-HD MA 5.1 is terrific.  Clear and perfectly situated.</p></body></html>

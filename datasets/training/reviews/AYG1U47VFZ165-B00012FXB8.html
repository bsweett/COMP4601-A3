One could argue that this package stands on par in stature to what THE LORD OF THE RINGS Extended DVD Versions have accomplished.  These discs (nine total) are filled with incredibly documented materials, including new documentaries exploring what went on behind-the-scenes while making each of the films as well as a semi-critique of the film series' impact on genre filmmaking.  If the discs have any shortcoming, I would say that the lack of true &quot;evaluation&quot; of Alien3 is missing from the supplementals; much of what is provided feels more &quot;promotional&quot; in nature and less &quot;substantive&quot; ... but that's a blip in comparison to the total package.  A sum total of nearly sixty hours of entertainment (films included), this QUADRILOGY makes for extensive viewing on aliens, filmmaking, and acting in scienc fiction films.  While the set boasts a hefty price-tag, I certainly felt my money was well spent.</p></body></html>

Well, saw this at the local megalomart for a few yen and took the chance. Had a intriguing story, interesting and fresh. Was satisfying visually. Actors OK. The gal cute. Characters there, but not overdone. Movie moves along, no straying down boring paths. Direction good. Fight scenes enjoyable...and compared to many movies nowadays, understandable in what is actually happening. NOT a bunch of quickly edited shots of incomprehensible movement. With the Aliens and Predators special weapons arsenal available, you want to see how they match up, that's the money shot of this whole undertaking. The Alien makes wicked use of his spiked tail, and the Predator is fearless. Some reviewers grip about some possibile differences between this foray and previous films. Eh, I saw the original Alien back in the day with my GF at the local theater. Did not see anything amiss. The Predator seemed the same, not too handsome, still.  Now if the Alien had buck teeth and the Predator had a blond wig I would object. I like the "team-up" near the end, preventing another dreary ending. The last shot? What did you expect? It's only logical, and in the age of sequels mandatory. Give this one a shot, I say.</p></body></html>

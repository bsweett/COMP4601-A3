<meta name="summary" content="John-Boy Walton and sibs fall down rabbit hole into Wonderland"></head><body><p>Well, it wasn't actually a rabbit hole, but a mysterious wardrobe in the upper reaches of an English country house owned by Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent), to which the Pevensie children - Peter, Edmund, Lucy, and Susan (William Moseley, Skandar Keynes, Georgie Henley, and Anna Popplewell) - are evacuated during the London Blitz.<br /><br />Out the back end of the wardrobe, the Pevensies find the land of Narnia, currently in the throes of a civil war between the forces of Evil, led by the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), and those for Good, led by Aslan, a regal lion, who sounds suspiciously like Liam Neeson. The inhabitants of Narnia aren't normal humans, but talking animals - including wolves, beavers, horses, foxes - plus centaurs, gryphons, satyrs, fauns, dwarves, and malformed monsters too numerous to enumerate. In any case, local legend has it that the power of the White Witch will be broken with the arrival of two human boys and two human girls, so you know that our young adventurers are much in demand by both sides.<br /><br />Cinematically, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA seemed to me like an amalgam of THE LORD OF THE RING series and the HARRY POTTER series, with a bit of King Arthur, Alice in Wonderland, and the Waltons thrown in for good measure. (William Moseley reminded me of a younger John-Boy.) Unfortunately, none of the Good Guys - the Pevensies and Aslan - have as nearly an interesting or meaty a character as the White Witch, and Swinton's performance was, for me, the best and only reason to see the film at all. True, the cinematography and fantastic scenery, both real and computer-generated, are almost as good as those in the RINGS series, but, after sitting through those interminable productions, who needs more?<br /><br />THE CHRONICLES is a pre-adolescent fantasy that I wouldn't necessarily recommend to anyone unless he/she could answer "yes" to the question, "So, what, are you 12?" There's also a blatant parallel between Aslan's role and the death and resurrection of Jesus which is entirely unnecessary though, because I've never read the original stories by C.S. Lewis, perhaps I'm just flaunting my ignorance. Since there are seven titles in the Narnia collection, I assume there are more films to come. Oh, please not. The LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy was enough.<br /><br />One particularly enchanting special effect was the manifestation of tree spirits in the mid-air aggregation of wind-blown leaves. And I have to admit that I especially liked the ending, not because it was the conclusion to a film which was causing me to fidget, but because it neatly tied up the Pevensies' years-long experience in Narnia to but a brief second of real-world time. That's the magic of childhood fantasies.</p></body></html>

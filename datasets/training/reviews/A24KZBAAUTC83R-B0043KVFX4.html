<meta name="summary" content="Alice Is Not Extinct!!"></head><body><p>After the solid debut of the 1st movie of Resident Evil, followed by the terrible follow-up debacle of the 2nd movie in this franchise - Resident Evil: Nemesis - This brand new movie is better than both!<br /><br />If you liked or loved the 1st movie, and for some horrific reason you liked the 2nd, then you will definately see a HUGE improvement in Extinction.<br /><br />Alice is back, looking much hotter and better than she did in Nemesis, and her new director - Russel Mulcahy of the original Highlander movie - does a better job than the last 2 directors did, both in action sequences and camera angles and showing us a grander scale of the earth now in a post-holocaust scenario.<br /><br />Resident Evil:Extinction feels like classic pulp post-holocaust-zombie fest, in the grand style of a more modernistic Max Max meets 28 Days Later. The mutants and zombies are well done, the action sequences get better and better, despite some of the lacksidasical characterization.<br /><br />But if you are a gamer, and not a hardcore reader, and like above average B-movie zombie action/adventure type movies - then Extinction will definately fill your bloody bill!<br /><br />Mulcahy's directive style is truly unique, both in scenic beauty and savage bloodlust. The movie is paced very well, with nary a dull moment.<br /><br />And the ending is different, along with new powers that Alice is embued with, and a stand-off with the lead mad scientist played by the same actor in the last 3 installments.<br /><br />Bottom line is: For both fans of S. D. Perry's fun novels, and for the gamers who still think the movies are still too different than the games, both audiences will agree that Extinction mixes both medias well, and truly stands alone as just a fun and exciting and top-notch zombie action movie.<br /><br />Let's hope for another stunning sequel. The movie is smart in leaving it wide open for one. And with solid writers, actors and directors like this onboard, then the thriving audiences of this franchise will follow...</p></body></html>

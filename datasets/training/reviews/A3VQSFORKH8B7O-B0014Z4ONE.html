<meta name="summary" content="AN EPIC "ADVENTURE" SET!"></head><body><p>One of the greatest action/adventure franchises of all time, the original "Indiana Jones" trilogy returns to DVD in an excellent three-disc collector's set! Chances are, if you own the original four-disc set, you won't be purchasing this collection. But if this is your first time buying it, then the wait is definitely worth it! All three films come together with terrific picture and sound, and come with great extras that are sure to entertain!<br /><br />RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (1981)<br />The film that started it all, "Raiders" is a fantastic adventure film that brings back the excitement of the 1930's movie serials! Featuring terrific acting from Harrison Ford and a stellar ensemble cast, thrilling action sequences and visual effects, and another memorable score by John Williams, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg crafted a fantastic film full of awe, wonder and excitement, cementing Indiana Jones as one of the greatest adventure heroes of all time!<br />Movie Grade: A<br /><br />INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984)<br />As he had done with the second installment of the "Star Wars" trilogy, Lucas wanted to create a darker, edgier film for the second installment of the "Indiana Jones" trilogy. But what worked for "Star Wars" does not work for Indy and the gang. While the film features some terrific action sequences, a great friendship story between Indy and his sidekick, Short Round, and another fantastic score from John Williams, the film goes to far into the macabre, featuring gruesome images (a man with his heart ripped out, then bursting into flames; men getting ripped apart by crocodiles) and humor (A gross dinner scene) that was unnecessary for an "Indy" film, and gave birth to the PG-13 rating. Still, the film features some good moments, making it a worthwhile film, though it is still the weakest of the first three films.<br />Movie Grade: B<br /><br />INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE (1989)<br />The best of the sequels to "Raiders" (And my personal favorite of the "Indy" adventures), "The Last Crusade" is a fantastic film that returns Indy to fighting Nazis in search of religious icons. What makes this film great are the terrific action sequences, some great spiritual references, and fantastic chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sir Sean Connery. These elements come together to create a fantastic adventure epic that redeems the franchise, and is both exciting and moving at the same time. Terrific entertainment!<br />Movie Grade: A+<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />"Indiana Jones: The Adventure Collection" is a terrific set for those who don't own the films already, and helps to get us all ready when "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" comes out on May 22. This set is highly recommended!<br />DVD Grade: A+</p></body></html>

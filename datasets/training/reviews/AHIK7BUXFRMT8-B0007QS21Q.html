<meta name="summary" content="Not Asimov But a Good Action Movie"></head><body><p>Isaac Asimov is my favorite sci-fi writer of all times. I have almost everything sci-fi that he has written and have read many of the stories more times than I can remember. This movie introduces Asimov's famous "Three Robotic Laws" and an early heroine named Susan Calvin.<br /><br />Asimov writes of his interest in robots as early as his teenage years and comments that the stories were divided into two classes; robots as menace and robots as pathos. "These charmed me"  he tells us of the robots as pathos class in the introduction to a collection of robot stories, To the best of my knowledge Asimov never wrote a robot story named "I, Robot" but acknowledges he was greatly influenced by a short story of that name written by Eando Binder in late 1938. As a tribute perhaps Asimov later assembled several of his Susan Calvin short stories into a group he named "I, Robot."<br /><br />We also meet Susan Calvin in the movie who was a special character favorite of Asimov's and appeared in 10 short stories about robots. Asimov tells us "The third robot story I wrote, "Liar" introduced Susan Calvin--with whom I promptly fell in love." In the movie the role of Susan Calvin is beautifully played by Bridget Moynahan.<br /><br />The Will Smith character, Del Spooner, never appears in any of Asimov's stories to the best of my knowledge. Asimov did have a robophobic policeman named Lije Baley who is introduced in his 1953 novel, "The Caves of Steel." Baley is forced to establish a working relationship with a humanoid robot named Daneel Olivaw. The robot, Sonny, voiced by Alan Tudyk, plays a role most similar to the Daneel Olivaw character in "The Robot Novels" series.<br /><br />Just looking at the movie I found it to be a good science fiction action movie and have enjoyed it more than once. If you find the movie interesting I assure you you'll find the books even more so. I see the Robot series as a prelude to the Empire series followed by the extensive Foundation series.  Counting all of the related books there are presently over 15 and three more, written by other authors, have been added with the approval of the Asimov estate. These books are a grand representation of the genre.</p></body></html>

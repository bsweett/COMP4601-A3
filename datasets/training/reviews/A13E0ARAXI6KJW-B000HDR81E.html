<meta name="summary" content="Wildly Fluctuating Look at an Embattled Couple Never Finds the Right Pitch"></head><body><p>The most resonant moment of this mishmash of a film is actually its ending. It's not important to know how the story ends except for the fact that it captures well all those quicksilver feelings of contradiction one feels when confronted with a significant other. Unfortunately, the rest of the 2006 movie enervates far more than it enthralls, primarily because director Peyton Reed never seems to find the right pitch for the story of an embattled couple who separate but choose to live together in the Chicago condo they bought. First-time feature screenwriters Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender make the primary mistake of trying to make the characters likable at the same time they are supposed to go for the jugular when it comes to the conniving game of one-upmanship each plays on the other.<br /><br />The focus is on Gary and Brooke, who meet in typical rom-com fashion at Wrigley Field. Right after a photo montage of the happy couple during the opening credits, we already sense tension between the two as they prepare for a family dinner party. The relationship falls apart quickly when Brooke recognizes man-child Gary will never change to accommodate her needs. This leads to a series of emotional blackmail episodes that bring moments of catharsis for the pair but at different times. The movie has some nice comedy elements and one-liners for about the first twenty minutes but then moves deeper into sad-eyed melodrama as what's left of the relationship spins out of control. The constant shifts in tone are especially awkward toward the end as the characters' mutual disappointments in one another grow tiresome and repetitive.<br /><br />Of the two leads, Jennifer Aniston fares somewhat better as Brooke since she does not bear the comedy burden that Vince Vaughn seems to feel as Gary. Aniston achieves moments of poignancy even though her character's manipulative nature is just as bad as his. Although he has some funny bits of business throughout, Vaughn struggles valiantly with the heavier moments, and the imbalance between the two actors becomes more pronounced as the story moves along. A stellar supporting cast has been assembled and mostly wasted. A pointlessly cast Ann-Margret has a barely-there cameo as Brooke's mother, while a gaunt-looking Judy Davis has the unenviable role of Brooke's ball-breaking, gallery owner boss.<br /><br />Under the radar since "Chasing Amy", Joey Lauren Adams plays Brooke's obligatory best friend Addie, and a now-grown Peter Billingsley (the cherubic Ralphie from the 1983 holiday classic, "A Christmas Story") is on very low wattage as her husband. Better in the Apple ads, Justin Long does what he can with the predictably fey role of mincing gallery assistant Christopher. As Brooke's a capella-singing, sexually ambiguous brother Richard, John Michael Higgins seems to have walked in from a Christopher Guest movie. Jason Bateman has a few funny moments as the couple's realtor pal Riggleman, and Cole Hauser (a dead ringer for his father Wings) brings out the oily swinger in Gary's younger brother Lupus. The best moments are provided by Jon Favreau as Gary's suspiciously connected bartender friend Johnny O and Vincent D'Onofrio looking stressed as Gary's straitlaced older brother Dennis.<br /><br />The DVD is chock full of extras - a making-of featurette, short films on Richard's singing group, the Tone Rangers, and the touring company owned by Gary and his brothers, and two separate commentary tracks - the first with Vaughan and Aniston (both displaying more charm here than in the movie itself) and the other a more straightforward account by Reed. An alternate ending has been included with separate commentary tracks by and Vaughn, all of which comes across as quite contrived. There are also several deleted and expanded scenes, as well as outtakes of varying quality. The last extra is a fitfully funny improv scene between Favreau and Vaughn.</p></body></html>

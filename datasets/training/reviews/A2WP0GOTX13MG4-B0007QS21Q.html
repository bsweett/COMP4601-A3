The robots have been programmed with three laws (paraphrased below):<br /><br />I.  Robots cannot harm humans.<br /><br />II.  Robots must obey humans, but law I controls.<br /><br />III.  Robots must protect themselves, but only if such protection does not conflict with the first two laws.<br /><br />This arrangement seems to be working well until one day when detective Del Spooner, played by Will Smith, gets a call to investigate a murder.  The victim is Dr. Alfred Lanning, played by James Cromwell, and it appears to be a suicide.  The thing about Dr. Lanning is that he is the inventor of the modern robot, and the company he works for is about to launch a new line of robots to the world.  Suspicions aroused, Detective Spooner investigates...<br /><br />This movie is based off an Isaac Asimov novel, which I admit I have not read.  The premise is interesting:  what happens when robots that have been programmed to benefit humanity through the application of three laws suddenly start acting in violation of the laws?  What is causing them to do that?  Can man creat an artificial construct that has man's capabilities?<br /><br />As for the movie itself, I found it to be pretty slick.  I've been told that it is not the thinker the book is, but since this is an action vehicle starring Will Smith, that can be expected (nothing against Will Smith, he was great in this movie--perfect for the part).  The landscape of Chicago in the year 2035 came off really well.  Unlike a lot of movies, the producers and director of 'I, Robot' chose to paint a future that has maintained many more elements of the present than futuristic devices such as wildly futuristic clothing and gadgets.  The cars and buildings of the future feel like they fit in rather well.<br /><br />The story movies along at a good pace.  There is not much in the way of down time.  The clues to the resolution are well placed.  There are a few predictable plot lines, but they don't detract from the movie as a whole.  There are a few red herrings regarding Bridget Moynahan's character.  I was somewhat surprised when her character was not as complicated as I expected her to turn out.<br /><br />Overall, its a good movie.  Will Smith found himself another good Sci-Fi vehicle.  His portrayal of dective Spooner was excellent.  The DVD has plenty of extras.  This movie is rewatchable.  I've been contemplating checking out the book the movie is based on, and I'm curious to see what the differences in the plot are considering when the book was written (some decades ago) and some of the devices that were used in the book.<br /><br />Grade:  4.25 stars</p></body></html>

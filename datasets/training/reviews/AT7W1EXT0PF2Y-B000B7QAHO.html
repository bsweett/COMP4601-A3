Unless you have no sense of humor, take any critique literally, and are immediately offended that is. Being a fan of Wonka, I was made physically ill to find that it had been remade. Remakes are a certain trend in Hollywood made possible by the fact that Hollywood is: 1. Concerned only about money, 2. unwilling to take chances, and 3. now lacking in any talent. I approached the Wonka remake with the same disgust that I have for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the Hills have Eyes, and the same way I would approach the remake of Gone with the Wind and Casablanca.<br /><br />We begin this movie with a CG opening because Hollywood is also now obsessed with computer animation. Mainly because it takes out all the work that real animation requires and gives jobs to untalented computer nerds who couldn't draw themselves out of a paper bag.<br /><br />We are then introduced to this film's Charlie Bucket. While the original Charlie was a good looking young chap that was probably pretty cool in real life, this Charlie is a ghastly, mouse-like, gangly, nerd in training, who, in real life, will only know the touch of women who want to "Make it with that kid from the Wonka movie." Upon seeing the interior of Charlie's house I get the inclination that this may not just be a remake of the previous Wonka, but downright plagiarism!<br /><br />Just as things are getting started, we're interrupted with some lame story about Wonka building a chocolate Taj Mahal for some Indian prince. Not only is this story long winded and silly, but it quite frankly is racist. It portrays Indians negatively as dullards that don't realize the chocolate will melt. It makes fun of their culture by a drip of chocolate falling on the prince's forehead, as if it were a tika mark. It then shows melting statues of Ganish and Shiva. Thanks for making fun of Hinduism Tim Burton. This story is but one section of a long flashback sequence, unnecessarily narrated by Grandpa. I could bring up the fact that good movies show instead of tell, but what would be the point?<br /><br />The first act drags on as it shows Wonka bars being shipped all over the world. Why? Everyone that got a ticket was a white European or American. Maybe next time Wonka should avoid putting all the winning bars in the same box.<br /><br />The first winner, of course, is Augustus Gloop. Unlike the original Gloop, this one cannot act, and neither can his parents. This scene is painful to watch. It shows him eating a chocolate bar for a full minute while he reads off some cue card for the voice over. "I...am...eating a chocolate bar...and...I taste something...that does not...taste familiar."<br /><br />The next winner, Veruca Salt, suffers even more so than Gloop. She is gangly, has a horrible put-upon smile, and fails to be the slightest bit intimidating. Her idea of being pushy is yelling, politely, "Where's my golden ticket? I want my golden ticket," certainly a far-cry from the original. (pardon the pun.)<br /><br />Winner #3 is Violet Beauregard, now a violent, bobbed tomboy. She says she gave up gum to find the golden ticket but then immediately claims she's been chewing the same piece of gum for three months. I guess her vice is lying? Winner #4 is Mike Teevee, who's vice, you'd think would be watching too much TV. In this version, it's kid of unclear. I guess he plays too many violent video games.<br /><br />Charlie of course gets the final Golden Ticket, but unlike the original film, Charlie gets the ticket in a candy bar he buys for himself. In the original the ticket was found in the bar he bought for his grandfather, therefore a good deed was rewarded.<br /><br />When the big day comes the kids enter the factory where they are greeted by some stupid singing automatons. Their song is long, uninspired, banal, nasally, and just plain annoying. Then Wonka shows up, unlike Gene Wilder's Wonka, Depp looks like Elton John on a bad day. Wonka's wit, along with the other forced humor in this film is atrociously unfunny, especially when juxtaposed with its original forbearer. Not to mention this newly-lisping Wonka is kind of scary, he's like the Michael Jackson of the candy world if you think of it. I assume they cut the scene where Wonka invites the children to spend the night. He even tells the kids that he's "eatable." This is just sick, Burton.<br /><br />The story is once again interrupted by some 5 minute story about how Wonka found the Oompa Loompas. Once again, the story is highly racist. It involves the Loompas being a jungle people that, "are good workers," and worship cocoa beans.<br /><br />The demise of each of these children is much more horrific and realistic than in the original. While you could chuckle at them before, can you laugh at these kids as they moan and scream in agony? I hope not. Likewise, while the people in the original movie had their faults, they were still likable. There's no redeeming factor in any of them this time, they all come across as axxholes that go around criticizing one another.<br /><br />During Veruca's scene when she tries to take one of Wonka's squirrels he exclaims, "Little girl, don't touch that squirrel's nuts, it'll make him crazy!" I'm not joking, he really says this, maybe Burton forgot he was making a kids movie, or perhaps he's just a moron that could care less about exposing children to sexual metaphors. Go to HeII, Burton. Soon a pack of rabid squirrels fall upon Veruca and attacks her. They gruesomely bite at her in what looks like a scene from Willard, or one of Richard Gear's fantasies, take your pick.<br /><br />Long story short: I wish; this thing just drags on and on. They tack on like an extra 20 minutes after the movie is supposed to be over! And there is this new, stupid, ridiculous ending that ruins the entire meaning and moral of the original. There is no reason to watch this film, trust me. Why eat imitation chocolate when you can have the real thing?</p></body></html>

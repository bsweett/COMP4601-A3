How? By a big old craft that can burrow down to the core,withstand heat that is hot as hell,literally (perhaps they are going through hell?) and restart the planet's engine, so to speak.<br /> I loved the actors, especially D.J. Quall who played the cyber-nerd and I liked how they added some comic relief through a very serious problem.The graphics were great bringing you right along with the crew and my favorite scene was the singing whales. Wonderful!  All in all this movie to me was entertaining in a big way, pulled at my heartstrings when many of the crew members were lost and ended with me having a chuckle at the antics of our cyber-nerd!  Good job! Good movie!</p></body></html>

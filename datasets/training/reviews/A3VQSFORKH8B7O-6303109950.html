But if you are lucky, you'll find a &quot;Director's Cut&quot; that features scenes that help better round out the story (&quot;Highlander 2: The Renegade Version,&quot; &quot;The Abyss Special Edition,&quot; and &quot;Superman: The Movie Expanded Edition&quot;). One of those fortunate films is George P. Cosmatos' cut for his epic western &quot;Tombstone.&quot; Released under Buena Vista's successful &quot;Vista Series&quot; packaging, &quot;Tombstone,&quot; my choice as the best western film ever made, now includes almost five minutes of footage that really give a better understanding of the story and the characters. And the lavish 2-disc set is filled with unbelievable extras, including three behind-the-scenes featurettes, including a brilliant look at the filming of the OK Corrall sequence, which was authenicated down to the last detail. A brilliant edition to the DVD collection. Tell 'em Wyatt Earp's coming, and hell's comin' with him. Grade: A+</p></body></html>

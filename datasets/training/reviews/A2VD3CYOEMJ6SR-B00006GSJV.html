<meta name="summary" content="Excellent, enthralling movie but plays loose with the facts"></head><body><p>I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. Russell Crowe's performance was extraordinary. He convincingly portrayed math genius John Nash, an oddball who sank deep into schizophrenia. His wife, well played by Jennifer Connelly helps, see him through his disease as he overcomes it, becoming a Nobel Prize winner for his &quot;game theory.&quot; Director Ron Howard gets us into Nash's mind as he is having his delusions and, therby lies one problem with this movie: you cannot get into someone's mind. The depiction of Nash's delusions, of necessity, must be somewhat fictional.<p>There are a number of other areas where facts have been skirted. First, the movie depicts Nash getting married and becoming a father. We don't find out that Nash already had a son through an earlier affair with another woman. Secondly, Nash's wife is an extraordinary woman who exhibited great stregnth but, she got divorced from Nash (and later they remarried). Again, the movie does not depict this. Thirdly, Nash shared the Nobel Prize, i.e., he was a cowinner. From the movie you would get the impression that he was the sole winner. Fourth, the movie depicts a tradition at Princeton where estemed elders of the math department are honored in a ceremony in which their colleagues present them with pens. There is no such tradition at Princeton. Finally, Nash makes a moving speech when he receives his award. However, the Nobel Prize is not an academy award .. there is no speech given by winners.<p>This movie is very moving and it helps us to get to know the story of John Nash. And, indeed, it is a wonderful story. However, when a movie distorts the truth, no matter how good the movie, I knock off a star in my review thus, four stars for an otherwise superb effort by director Ron Howard.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What started out interesting grew very tiresome: 21 GRAMS in 205 MINUTES!"></head><body><p>The more I think about 21 GRAMS the more I start to dislike it...so I better write quickly before the stars start decreasing!<br /><br />Three separate lives all coming together as as a result of a car accident that kills a husband and two children. OKAY....told in a non-linear way....OKAY....some riveting performances.....OKAY....ending with a thud of an explanation....NOT OKAY.<br /><br />After being flipped back and forth from story to story, time frame to time frame, trying to piece all of it together to result in a meaningful theme...all we get is 21 Grams is the weight of the soul...etc.etc.?? If the point of the film was that a soul is way more than just the biological 21 gram weight...well.....never mind!<br /><br />When one boils down the entire plot and it's moral, why did director Alejandro Inaritu need to jerk us back and forth making us as nauseated as Sean Penn was in this film? I stayed with it (heck I had no choice!) for about 90 minutes, but after that this film and it's "clever" style just became downright annoying. I was tired of it and wanted it to end!!! The King in AMADEUS loosely quoted said "Once in a while it's just a little too...too....long.Just cut a few notes and I'm sure it will be just perfect!" Listen to the King Alejandro!<br /><br /> CRASH, TRAFFIC and MEMENTO do all of this better!<br /><br />This film has all the markings of a truly great film. The sound, though, is probably it's worst feature.You have to keep lowering it during music sequences and yelling and raising it for lots of low-talking! That is a real pain in a film that jumps around like a worm on a hot rock! I best stop now, because a feel another star falling!</p></body></html>

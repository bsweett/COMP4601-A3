<meta name="summary" content="A Good Conclusion That Begs For A Sequel"></head><body><p>If given more time, this movie would have been better than the final result, but the final result is still really good. I understood the plot and what the film was trying to tell us through symbolism the way an X-Men story should. Some characters do "die" in this movie, but in the world of the X-Men, they are always brought back. Characters have died in the comics and came back, and the small clip at the end of the credits of this movie proves that dead doesn't always mean dead.<br /><br />I thought they made good use of the special effects of the film. One of the most beautiful parts of the movie was watching Angel fly over the bridge. The special effects really came in use at the exciting battle scene towards the end of the movie. You hear about the war coming in the previous two movies and now it is finally hear and it makes for a good watch that isn't boring.<br /><br />The acting is also as great as in the other films as well. There are some powerful scenes such as when Logan and Storm are crying over one of their friends who had died. Overall, if you are a fan of the series, then you owe it to yourself to get the DVD. No; it isn't the best in the series, but if you love the X-Men movies and are like me, then you will probably like this as well.</p></body></html>

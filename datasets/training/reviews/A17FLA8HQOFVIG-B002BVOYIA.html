<meta name="summary" content="A lesson in history.  And Don Chheadle is a fine actor."></head><body><p>I've read a lot about the genocide in Rwanda.  I picture scenes of despair, murder, and dismemberment.  All I have to do is hear the word "Rwanda" and I am filled with sadness at the thought of the brutality of human beings.<br /><br />I therefore looked forward to seeing Hotel Rwanda.  Don Cheadle had even been nominated for an academy award for his outstanding performance.  I wanted the world to know of the horror that took place just ten years ago.  And I hoped that somehow, this knowledge might change something.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is not that film.  I was disappointed.  However, I am not the filmmaker.  And I wasn't the one making the decisions.  This is not the story of the genocide.  It is simply the true story of one courageous man who helped save more than a thousand people.  And, for this reason it is a fine film because I know it was viewed by millions of people, some of whom had never even heard of the country itself.<br /><br />Don Cheadle is superb in the lead role.  He manages his luxury hotel with sophisticated understanding of human nature and the power of bribes and flattery.  This is the time of the Hutu uprising and, as he is a Hutu, he is safe.  But his wife is Tutsi and she and their children are at risk.  How he saves them, as well as all the other people, is a story of courage.  He's a fine actor, and he shows complex emotions.  I was always aware of the terror he felt underneath all his outward calm, and I, too, feared for his family.<br /><br />Nick Nolte is cast as the powerless U.N. official.  His performance was fine, as usual.  It's obvious though that he's had some plastic surgery.  It makes his face look smoother but I miss his cragginess and range of expression.<br /><br />This was not a perfect film.  It was too long.  It somehow simplified the horror.  And it never dealt with the fact that after the Hutus had done their murdering, the Tutsis came back and murdered some more.  However, I applaud the fact that it was made at all.  And I also came away with a real appreciation of Don Cheadle's acting skill.<br /><br />Recommended.  It's a true story.  And a lesson in History.</p></body></html>

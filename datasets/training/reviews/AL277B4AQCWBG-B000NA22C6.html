The problem seems to be the source material: Stephen King's story is probably too slight to justify a feature, and the setup is so well crafted in the "intelligent thriller" mode that the climax, when it comes, feels far less clever than it ought to be. Still, it's not without its compensations. David Koepp continues to demonstrate that he can direct as well as write. He provides plenty of Hitchcockian moments of suspense, and the score by Philip Glass evokes precisely the kind of music Bernard Herrmann used to write. Johnny Depp is wonderful - as always - and here he again shows a real talent for comedy that has been under-utilized for much of his career. He cleverly and convincingly plays the eccentric writer, harried by an ongoing divorce and writer's block, who talks to himself and has an increasingly severe facial tic. His thoroughly entertaining performance adds enormously to the enjoyment of what is otherwise a rather light-weight affair.</p></body></html>

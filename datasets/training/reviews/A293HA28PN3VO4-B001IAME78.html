<meta name="summary" content="Movie gets progressively better-a bit slow at beginning"></head><body><p>This is a review of the Blu-Ray (some of these reviews were simply ported over from the SD), tested on a 42" Panasonic Plasma and BD30k BD Player. PQ 4/5, Sound 4/5. The picture had some noise in it, but nothing too distracting; overall, the picture was very sharp, but not the best transfer I've ever seen. The sound was powerful at times, and the DTS sound was powerful and effective during shooting and "thunderous/base" portions. It was not as powerful as some other Blu-Ray films I've seen.<br /><br />I prefer a gripping story over over the top effects, but you expect the latter when you watch a super hero action movie. I am a fan of Ed Norton and thought his portrayal as a meager guy engulfed in his superpower worked for the film. His "every-day guy" look worked to express the juxtaposition with the hulk. Liv Tyler continues to be flat in her affect for most of her films, so I just could not sympathize with her character.<br /><br />I do wish that the movie was paced faster. Aside from 3 action scenes, this was a slow moving film in the super hero genre. The last 20 minutes of the film were a standout, where effects are concerned, and the tie in with Iron Man was a welcomed tidbit at the end, which showed continued promise for the franchise.<br /><br />I had hoped that they would take an opportunity to share more info about how the Hulk had gotten his superpower and what research had been done with Betsy's character. I realize this is an action movie, and is not supposed to be a scientific examination of gamma rays and its effects, but I think it would have been interesting to add another dimension.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nice little movie, especially compared with The Summer of Junk."></head><body><p>Little Miss Sunshine is an earnest and amusing little movie. There are some nice moments, a wonderful performance by Alan Arkin, and a "slice of life" feel that reinforces that gut feeling (which turns out to be correct) that all of us are pretty screwed up -- which is  at least half the reason that human beings are endearing.<br /><br />This isn't a great film by any means. The dialogue is extremely variable. The characters are, too, veering from stereotypical to very interesting.  The acting ranges from okay (Toni Collette, who channels the exact same character, down to the facial expressions, she played in The Sixth Sense) to very good (Greg Kinnear) to Oscar-nomination worthy (Alan Arkin). The story isn't as tight as it could be either, but that's part of its charm. It's a loose travelogue rather than a Hero's Journey, and a gentle, poigant pleasure.</p></body></html>

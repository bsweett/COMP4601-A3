It was easy to believe that this was, indeed, a "police procedureal" from the 70s because everything from set design to costume design was right on target.<br /><br />While this wasn't meant to be a thriller, it could have benefited from a quicker pace. There were times where it felt like a two hour and forty minute film. I think we're seeing some of that in the box office receipts, which haven't been impressive. (As of this weekend, it's third, the film hasn't grossed $30m, and cost $85m to make).<br /><br />But it's difficult to make a movie about a serial killer when the identity of the serial killer isn't known, and isn't likely to be known. Well more than half of the fun in a film of this type is capturing the bad guy. When you toss that out, all you have left is trying to find the bad guy, and making your best guess. Not that this made Zodiac a bad film by any stretch,</p></body></html>

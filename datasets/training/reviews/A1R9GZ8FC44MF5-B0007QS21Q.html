<meta name="summary" content="One of Will's best movies."></head><body><p>Personally i never read the books (in fact i dont read books period, theyre too damn boring) so im not offended that this movie wasnt like some stupid book, it was a very good entertaining film, its a movie not a book, if you want to be bored and are too narrowminded to appreciate entertainment then dont watch movies, go read your freakin book.  Now onto the movie, it had a great story (i dont care if its like the book, who does? some nerd, o freakin well, cry me a river), it was very funny throughout, it had some drama, not heartwrenching but still pretty sad stuff, and the humor didnt hurt the drama or the film it added to the entertainment (unlike comedies whcih suck).  The action was good, not great, there were 2 big action scenes and a few other little ones, what was there was well done, intense, and creative, but we could use alittle more, thats the only thing wrong with the movie, just needs to be longer with more action, but since i already bought the dvd i hope they dont double dip this one, so im satisfied, got my moneys worth.  9 out of a 10.</p></body></html>

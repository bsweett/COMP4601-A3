<meta name="summary" content="THE YEAR'S ONLY "GENIUS" FILM"></head><body><p>THE PRESTIGE is the year's best film. Not!! Yet,it is definitely the most intelligent film I have seen in 2006 - a year where a dozen great films came out.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman did 4 films this year and this one is without the blossom of a doubt, his best performance till date. I "didn't" think too highly of him (Considering he's done a film called Van Helsing; Scoop was a three star grade film; The Fountain rocked while everyone knows XMEN insults my age,really, I'm 22 you see) but he gave a very realistic portrayal of his character. What truly makes Hugh Jackman stand out is not quite his height/poise or dialogue delivery. The real charm lies in the manner in which the actor uses his arms, legs, speech, movements, reactions, etc. to actually make a point to an unsuspecting crowd.<br /><br />While watching The Prestige, I wondered to myself who the second actor was. You see, I had never seen a Christian Bale film (Surprise!) I, personally, think he was as good as Hugh Jackman was. The direction is immaculate and will make the hair on your back stand.<br /><br />It's quite humorous that Amazon forget to include Scarlett Johansson's name on the main page (film cast) She did a good job, her role was limited but it is always good to see someone so beautiful perform in a film as good as The Prestige. In all likeliness, Prestige will restore your faith in films even if it wasn't really lost. There is a great "unpredictability" about the whole plot but the execution is better than the plot itself. A lot of us including me guessed the twist towards the end but that still was only a part of the bigger twist altogether.<br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br /><br />Where Prestige actually stands out is in the film's ability to shock you. The best scenes in the film include the following - When Hugh Jackman is outsmarted by Christian Bale and is left hanging by a rope like a character in a kindergarten show; the scene in which the hats are displayed, the first scene of the film, the rivalry scenes between the two young magicians, Hugh Jackman and his presentation skills as a magician, David Bowie's great cameo, the innumerable twists and many more.<br /><br />Overall, I'd like to say that this film as good as it is, is because it is the kind of film you want to see do good and it does just that. Masterfully. Many comparisons have been made with "The Illusionist" Now I'm a bit of a Ed Norton fan but realistically speaking THE PRESTIGE spanks ILLUSIONIST on the head three times over without even trying. Not only is it a better, more creative, more captivating film but it's also a bigger film on the whole. If you compare the endings of the two films, you would know what I mean. Nonetheless, both films are definitely worth watching a few times over.</p></body></html>

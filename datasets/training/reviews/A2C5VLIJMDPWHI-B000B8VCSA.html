<meta name="summary" content="Bourne movies always keep my attention"></head><body><p>I'm not a big action movie buff, but every time one of the Bourne movies comes on, I stop what I'm doing to watch it. In "Bourne Identity," Jason Bourne was struggling to find out how he ended up in the water accident and in this film he wants to know just who he is. The problem is that the CIA is after him at the same time. They don't believe he really doesn't know as much as he seems to not know. But what both Bourne and the CIA do know is that regardless of whether he remembers the deal he made three years ago, his fighting and killing instincts have not left him. In "Bourne Identity," he was surprised at how much he knew about defending himself and plotting on ways to disappear. The average man just doesn't know how to safely land jumping from building to building and hopping over glass with just a T-shirt from a clothing line to protect him. But Jason Bourne (aka Dave Webb) does, and he wants to know what happened to him to make him this way. The CIA is after him and he's after the CIA. The only problem is he doesn't know the name of the person he wants to see when he reaches that person. Meanwhile two female agents don't like the way the Bourne mission is going. It's gone from legal to criminal, and agents are wondering whether these two ladies are fighting for or against him.<br /><br />Although Jason Bourne should've been dead after all the car accidents and hopping from building to building without so much as an ankle sprain, the movie was still good. Was it realistic? For someone who knows how to fight and kills for a living, certainly he's going to have more strength than your everyday guy. But there were some running scenes that were over the top. That didn't stop me from enjoying the film though. I've enjoyed all three.</p></body></html>

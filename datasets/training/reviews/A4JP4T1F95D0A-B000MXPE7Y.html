This is an intelligent piece of work, very subtle and well acted, though the characters are very subdued.  The problem is the pacing for me.  At 2 hours and 40 minutes it seemed to drag for me.  This isn't a Bourne movie with lots of action.  Sure there is a kill here or there, but for the most part it is a character driven story.  I enjoyed the movie, but I didn't find it compelling enough that I would purchase it for future viewings.  I would say to rent this one first to make sure it is your type of movie.</p></body></html>

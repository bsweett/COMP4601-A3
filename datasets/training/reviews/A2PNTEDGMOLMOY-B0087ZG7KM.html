<meta name="summary" content="Funny, refreshingly focused on the "fairer sex""></head><body><p>I always love the notion of women being dubbed "the fairer sex."  I've always been raised that a woman can do pretty much anything a man can do, and if my 41 years on this earth have taught me anything, it's that women can be just as crude, boorish and stupid as men.<br /><br />Hollywood seems to forget this, basing far too many of its female characters (especially in comedies) on sterile models of Barbie-esque perfection.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that Hollywood has milked the "funny good guy must steal the bombshell from the rich jerk" storyline for ages - the object of desire in these movies is invariably given little to do.  (Think Rachel McAdams in "Wedding Crashers" - a talented actress does little more than grin and look gorgeous).<br /><br />"Bridesmaids" takes a refreshing break from tradition by focusing almost exclusively on the ladies.  And these ladies, by and large, do not act like "ladies," but instead are well-rounded, flawed, funny women.  Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph of "SNL" fame play lifelong friends who are going on different tracks as they head into their 30s.  Wiig's Annie has her self-esteem in the dumpster after her Milwaukee bakery failed - now she's content to be on the booty call speed dial for a spectacular jerk (Jon Hamm of "Mad Men").  Rudolph's Lillian, on the other hand, has gotten engaged to a successful guy in Chicago and she seems destined for a life of country clubs and European vacations.<br /><br />Both friends understand they are growing apart, so Lillian asks Annie to be her maid of honor, naturally.  Annie is thrilled, only to be horrified that Lillian's future sister-in-law appears to be all-too-eager to become Lillian's new best friend.  This harpy, Helen, played with WASPy evil by Rose Byrne, is everything that Annie is not - rich, poised, and (seemingly) self-assured.  What ensues is a traditional battle royale between Annie and Helen as they vie for the role of maid of honor.  Thanks to the other bridesmaids, including Megan (Melissa McCarthy) and Rita (Wendi McLendon Covey of "Reno 911"), this is a battle spiced with raunchy humor and replete with poetic profanity.  These are good things.<br /><br />I must admit that I came to "Bridesmaids" late, after all the hype and Oscar nominations.  Ultimately I can't say that this is a great comedy - it is genuinely funny and has a few laugh-out-loud moments, and it definitely has a heart.  But all I've heard is that "'Bridesmaids' is the new 'Hangover.'"  That just flat-out isn't true - even despite the great comic performance by Melissa McCarthy as Megan, there is nothing in "Bridesmaids" that is as original as "The Hangover," if only because there is nothing in this movie that approaches the comic genius of Zach Galifianakis.  (Perhaps if Wendi McLendon Covey had been given a little more to do - she inexplicably gets no lines in the second half of the movie.  The lady is comic gold.)<br /><br />Definitely a solid comic effort - something that is all too rare these days - and an enjoyable reminder that women can do far more in a comedy than be the sterile object of desire.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

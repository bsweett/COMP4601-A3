<meta name="summary" content="Different kind of comedy"></head><body><p>This was not your regular comedy.  This was more light humor.  It was also a drama at the same time.  Good perfomances and just a really good movie.  It teaches you a lesson.  It shows that older people arent useless they can still accomplish things.  Scarlett Johansson and  Selma Blair are hot.</p></body></html>

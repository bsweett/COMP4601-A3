<meta name="summary" content="Violence and vigilantism both destroy"></head><body><p>SPOILERS AHEAD!<br /><br />They just destroy in different ways.  The violence inflicted on the loving couple that kills one of them leaves the other with a wounded soul.  She tries to exorcise her demons by killing other criminals on the streets of New York late at night, but is increasingly haunted by her own actions and by the memories of her victims' last words.<br /><br />Even at the end, she insists to a sympathetic police officer that she has the right to kill every last one of her attackers.  Too bad they went for the weak, easy ending, wherein she gets to have her day and the cop lets her get away with it.  I don't buy that this could ever happen in real life.  A real cop would have taken her down and had her put in jail despite his own regrets and wishes to the contrary.<br /><br />Vigilantism and revenge may feel good or seem appropriate at the time, but they too leave irreparable scars and the person can never be the same again.  At least they reiterated this theme in the film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Filled with biting humor"></head><body><p>In today's society it is difficult for young men to see why they must leave home and strike out on there own adventure. Tripp (Matthew McConaughey) is one of those young thirty-five year old sons that are part of today's society. His parents Al and Sue (Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates) only want what is best for him and heir a professional (Sarah Jessica Parker) to help cut the apron strings.<br /><br />Needles to say that all the things you expect to happen happens. What sets this particular movie above the standard the standard formula is the exceptional acting and the pacing is strange. And the gratuitous nude scene is more that a few flashes in the moon light.<br /><br />In this film even the "B" story and the supporting characters get plenty of center stage. Kit (Zooey Deschanel) added a splash of normalcy.<br /><br />The only downside to the movie is the annoying introductory song which is soon forgotten and mad up for with the appropriate exit songs.<br /><br />So get out the popcorn and hit the road with Tripp.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IOM0X8">Sahara [Blu-ray] ~ Matthew McConaughey</a></p></body></html>

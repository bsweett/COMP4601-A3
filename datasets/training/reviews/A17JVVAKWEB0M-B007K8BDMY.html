<meta name="summary" content=""Spellbinding" & "Mesmerizing"...believe the critics"></head><body><p>For the last thirteen years of his life, Timothy Treadwell's struggles with the modern world drew him to re-invent himself in the wilds of Alaska. He gained a sense of satisfaction living, loving and "protecting" the grizzly bears of the picturesque coastline of the Katmai National Park. That he met his end being sliced and torn by the teeth and claws of the animals he loved surprised none.  Grizzly Man is his story.<br /><br />The posters and trailers for the film provide the one word snippets "Spellbinding" and "Mesmerizing" from reviews of the Warner Herzog documentary. Two more apropos terms could not be selected, as the film fills viewers with equal parts awe and pity, intrigue and condescending judgment. Watching the footage Treadwell recorded while living among the bears produces the same feelings as listening to a captivating scholar and watching a child touch a hot stove at the same time. He's dazzling and informative, but his life is also frightening. His death seemed as inevitable as the eclectic Treadwell's onetime guest appearance with the bewitched David Letterman.<br /><br />Because of Treadwell's foolhardy endeavors, he recorded video that only an amateur could capture. For union issues and insurance risks alone, no production company would ever finance someone to make a film while living among bears (he actually touches them on occasion). His footage of bears at play, catching salmon and battling for territorial rights are the film's greatest feature.  But the pleasure gained from viewing them forever tethers itself to the knowledge that the project led to the death of the filmmaker. We literally view the world as a dead man saw it.  Is this exploitation?  Some would say "Yes".<br /><br />Whether the film exploits his death is as ambiguous as the message of his life.  I would guess that a dozen people would come away from Grizzly Man with 12 different opinions of Treadwell.  Some would say he is to be admired, a man so full of life that his love and dreams seemed to infect all who met him (the only detractors in the film are people who never met him).  Other people will find his life laughable, pointing to his lack of accomplishments and the possibility that he caused more harm to the bears by assimilating them to man.<br /><br />I found him to be sincere, but a bit lost. I saw a boy who played with teddy bears as a child and then tried to play with the real things as an adult...or maybe never really grew up at all.  He was not the grizzly's messiah, as he seemed to believe, but he did live with a zest for life and a determination for curing the wrongs he thought existed.  Should we really judge him so harshly because his vision of the world was a bit unrealistic?<br /><br />Many define him by his oddities, questionable judgment and grandiose behaviors.  But the film presents a deeper understanding of the man.  By ending with an old cowboy ballad, Grizzly Man marries Treadwell to the romantic ideal of the frontiersman, a man who casts off the comforts and stability of society to quench a thirst only satisfied in nature.  All we can really say about his motivations is that Timothy Treadwell found something living with the grizzly bears that gave him purpose in life.  We should all be so lucky.<br /><br />He'd tell you a tale of the old days<br />When the country was wild all around<br />Sit under the stars of the Milky Way<br />And listen while the coyotes howl.<br />(From "Coyotes" by Don Edwards, featured in Grizzly Man)</p></body></html>

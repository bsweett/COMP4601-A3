Daylight never seems to reach this place where human transgressions seem to be the norm, as shadows and darkness enhance the gloomy milieu in which the characters exist.  This film is the very archetype of film noir as no one can trust anyone and death lurks around every corner.  The film's heroes are less than perfect with either a dark past or they suffer from some terminal condition.  Everything is perfect in regards to film noir, yet the world is as far as possible from an utopia as life is easily expendable and everyone is guilty of something.<br /><br />In three of Frank Miller's graphic novels Sin City has generated the foundation for the films, as the audience get the opportunity to follow three disconnected adventures.  These three adventures lead the audience into a dark place, an unwanted domain if it was real, but the black and white cinematography make it look and feel like the graphic novel that Miller created.  This makes the film tolerable, as the violence is extreme, detailed, and intense.  If Sin City was shot in the spirit of Spider-Man (2002) the film would be extremely gory, grotesque, and probably would not be allowed in theater throughout the United States.  Thus, as mentioned, the black and white cinematography makes the film tolerable and viewable, but it also surpasses the cinematography from other graphic novels by light-years, as it displays brilliance.<br /><br />The adventures are all divided up by the women in the story, which are an essential part of the atmosphere of the film.  None of the women seem to be over the age of 25 while they all are prostitutes with daring clothing revealing more than covering.  The prostitution and the sexually suggestive environment intensifies the sleaziness of the criminal milieu, which enhances the distrusting atmosphere.  However, the women in Sin City are no feeble women.  These women do not mind pulling the trigger when it counts, or swinging a blade if necessary.  Nonetheless, these women also bring out the little good and human compassion, if one can call it that, which is a rare commodity in Basin City where the stories take place.<br /><br />After the film's opening the audience is introduced to the cop Harrigan (Bruce Willis) who is about to make his final arrest before retirement.  This arrest attempt leads Harrigan to reveal the location where he can find a psychopathic killer that sexually lusts for torturing young girls.  He is also aware that the pedophile has recently kidnapped a young girl named Nancy.  However, this psycho-killer is not unknown to him, as he has slipped his grasp many times before.  The psychopath is the son of the mayor, and this could lead to some major difficulty for Harrigan through the mayor's influential powers.<br /><br />Following Harrigan's case, the audience gets to follow Marv (Mickey Rourke), an ex-convict with delusional tendencies and a beautiful parole officer.  Marv has just met and had his best intimate moment with Goldie.  When Marv awakens from his sexually exhausted slumber he discovers that Goldie is dead and the cops have already been tipped.  Angry and vengeful Marv escapes the trap in order to find the true identity behind Goldie's killer, which leads the audience into a blood splattered river that flows from Marv's path.<br /><br />Shellie's (Brittany Murphy) ex-boyfriend Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) instigates the third adventure where the freedom of the girls in the Old Time comes in jeopardy, as the truce between the cops, the mob, and the prostitutes is crumbling.  The hero in this tale is Dwight (Clive Owen), a criminal with a recent face job, who turns into the knight in shining armor, but much better than in King Arthur (2004).  This sequence displays the strength that the women possess when they decide enough is enough, which of course turns very bloody.<br /><br />There are several elements in the film that make this film brilliant, but one must begin with expressing gratitude to the casting directors Beth Sepko and Mary Vernieu who put together a splendid cast.  The cast consists of actors such as Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Benicio Del Toro, Brittany Murphy, Clive Owen, Elijah Wood, Nick Stahl, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, Jessica Alba and many others.  A couple of the highlights are Rourke's performance as Marv, as he brings out the dirty and nasty in a delusional criminal who is on a murderous destructive path while Del Toro's performance as Jackie Boy is simply excellent.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez who has directed several action films is a perfect choice to lead this project, as he also had help from Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino.  The scenes are full of speed, action, and nitty-gritty violence, which intentionally goes over the top with high frequency.  This exaggerated violence often seems humorous and will occasionally force the audience into laughter.  However, laughing at mutilation is hardly acceptable, which suggests that the audience is as guilty to the crime as the perpetrator.  This is a cleverly incorporation of the visual theme that no one is innocent, as all are guilty, even the audience members.  Furthermore, the heavy use of cerebral character monologues enhances the audience's cerebral participation in the film, as little is left for the imagination, yet it leaves the audience contemplating moral values.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Funny Movie"></head><body><p>I bought this movie today. I've never seen the TV show before I don't think. The movie is very funny, I love Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. There are other great actors who are in the movie as well. Last but not least the band that was featured in the movie Old School &quot;The Dan Band&quot; play in the movie.</p></body></html>

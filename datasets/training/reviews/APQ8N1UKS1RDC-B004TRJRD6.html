<meta name="summary" content="STAY AWAY FROM THE VERSION YOU NEVER SEEN!"></head><body><p>O.K. Folks heads up!We all know your buying this version<br /><br />for the famous spider walk scene,don't blame you it is a<br /><br />great scene but you can see that scene also in the 25th<br /><br />anniv.edit.The 25th addition has that scene and every<br /><br />other scene that was not shown in the theatrical version<br /><br />on the flip side of the disc.Also like to point out that it has scenes not shown in the version you never seen.Also the 25th<br /><br />anniv.edit.Has interviews with the writer,director special<br /><br />fx dept.and most of all the actors over 75 min.of it!Also<br /><br />you get a whole lot more trailers too!This version is out<br /><br />because Blatty really did not like the ending of the orig.<br /><br />He thought the ending was a downer(hello! it's a horror movie)<br /><br />and wanted this more upbeat ending with the detective and the<br /><br />priest(no thank you this is not the 30's where you always had<br /><br />to have a happy ending-I don't like happy endings in horror<br /><br />films,just like I don't like horror endings in comedies)So if<br /><br />you really love this movie,or are a horror fanatic like me,and<br /><br />always have to slide your fingers across your perfect titles<br /><br />like me,have your fingers hit the 25th annv.and not this.It<br /><br />should be called the version you don't need to see.Amazon<br /><br />has the 25th ANNIV.FOR SALE STILL(THANK GOD! YOU GUYS ROCK)But<br /><br />who knows for how long.So please buy it now and stay away from this!NOTE THE ONE STAR IS FOR BLATTY'S VERSION!I GIVE 5 STARS<br /><br />FOR THE DIRECTOR FRIEDKEN'S VERSION THE 1973 EXORCIST IS ONE<br /><br />OF THE BEST OF ALL TIME NO HORROR COLL.IS COMPLETE WITHOUT<br /><br />IT.REMEMBER THE 25th addition,you have been warned!</p></body></html>

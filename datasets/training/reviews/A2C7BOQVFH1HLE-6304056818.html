I remember watching this on the Turner Classic Movies channel and it was barely watchable but now it's like watching a new film!  While the picture quality isn't perfect as there are a few problematic frames here and there but compared to what I saw on the TCM channel the difference is like night and day.  As for the sound quality the DTS HD MA 5.1 sound is fantastic.  The special features are very good as well with great documentaries and even the not-so-good "sequel" featuring Robby the Robot "The Invisible Boy" which comes across more like a kiddy comedy than its much more serious and better prior film.  "Forbidden Planet" marks a number of firsts such as being MGM's first serious Sci-Fi film, the birth of techno music for the score, the depiction of man travelling faster than light and exploring other planets and for fans of Star Trek like myself you get the feeling that you are watching the true pilot of Star Trek: TOS.  Star Trek: TOS is like the serialised tv version of the "Forbidden Planet" feature film like the way it was for "M*A*S*H".  The relationship between the doctor and the captain prefigures Bones and Kirk, the short mini skirts that Anne Francis wears and the sexual innuendoes also show up on Star Trek: TOS while the reference to adamantium metal reminded me of Wolverine and the deep shafts underground reminded me a lot of the Death Star in "Star Wars" and of a couple of episodes in the early seasons of "Babylon 5" concerning the strange being on the planet below the space station.  Even Disney Studios had a hand in the special effects here as MGM takes a genre that was at the time "B" movie fodder into the "A" grade.<br /><br />Fans of Sci-Fi simply have to have this in their video library as an example of a pioneer and major influencer of many sci-fi films that followed.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

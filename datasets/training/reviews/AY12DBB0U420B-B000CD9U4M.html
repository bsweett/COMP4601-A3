<meta name="summary" content="Fun Frivolous Movie. Relax and Enjoy."></head><body><p>Last night's bargain-rack movie was "Charlie and The Chocolate Factory," a movie by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp. That says a lot doesn't it? Would you be expecting weird, or what? Remember, these guys have teamed up in "Edward Scissorhands" and "The Corpse Bride." Well, you can also add the music of Danny Elfman, former leader of "Oingo Boingo" fame. Strange, strange movie. Oh, and by the way, if you've ever had the experience of a "fixer-upper" house or have even considered it, viewing the "fixer-upper" in this movie is worth the admission or DVD price.<br /><br />In any case, the Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory, closed for some time with all the employees fired, has reopened and has offered a "Golden Ticket" to the first five people who find it inside five of their Willy Wonka Chocolate Bars sold on a world-wide basis. Their prize is a one-day all-you-can-eat tour of the new factory. The first four tickets were easy to find and, let's-just-say, they went to kids that you or Johnny Depp, the leader of the tour, would probably not care to spend a day with. The fifth kid, Charlie, came from an extended family who lived in the "fixer-upper" place and he was accompanied by his grandfather, a former laid-off worker in the old Willy Wonka Factory, who was suspected of giving away trade secrets in the old Willy Wonka days. Anyway, it's a weird tour. All the rivers, waterfalls, lakes and any other forms of water are liquid chocolate and the grass, flowers and anything else on the tour is one or another form of edible candy. Weird place. The elevators go up and down or sideways, depending on which way you want to go. The actors are all real (well, the lilleputian-sized people are an animation trick), but the factory, tour and everything else is one of these computer animation jobs, and it's clever and amusing. It's a fun, frivolous movie. Relax and enjoy.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Superb DVD  Package of the Film"></head><body><p>This film is what I would personally classify as more in the horror camp, than in the Supernatural Thriller. The film is unsurprisingly great. The Extras are the definitive element for this  package.<br /><br />The film is basically Body Jumping. If, in my view, the film makers had included more of the material that spooks in LOST SOULS, or even the scarey elements of CONSTANTINE, I probably would like it even more. However, the film makers focus on this being a "Supernatural Thriller" film.<br /><br />The detail in this film is beyond good. All of the Hoodoo and Voodoo elements are the real deal, which is something lacking in some films ( The makeup artists even used protection spells in the trailers).<br /><br />The film shows great details in and around the now "Old" New Orleans. The story is one to be experienced ... certainly, what you don't believe cannot hurt you ... but ??<br /><br />THE EXTRAS: The production features are beyond good. Plenty of detail about what has been done. Even the elements about the background of the film are so superb. The commentary done by the director is masterful, and great exposition. The very nice extras are stories from the leads, who give part of themselves in showing what they have behind the characters of the film.<br /><br />Contrary to what the director says, the pivotal character is not Kate Hudson, but it is John Hurt ...Kate is practically the quiet eye at the center of the storm, but John is part of the storm, and in many respects the reason for the storm.<br /><br />Masterful film ...

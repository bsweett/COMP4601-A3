Visually, it's stunning; a sci-fi/noir hybrid similar in tone (at least aesthetically) to "Bladerunner".<br /><br />Although the film is visually provocative, as well as intelligent and interesting, the main weakness is that none of the characters are really particularly engaging or well-rounded. So once you get past the nifty visuals and heady plot twists, there's not much to hold onto.<br /><br />It's interesting that this film came out so close in time to "The Matrix" because there really are a lot of similarities. Both films explore the idea that the mundane, everyday world around us is really all a ruse, and that some other force is using modern-day humanity as a pawn to advance their own agenda. And in both films, the main character is a unique man who has the ability to transcend the illusory game he's been plugged into and create his own destiny. I suppose both films are just modern takes on the age-old "free will vs predestination" dillemna.</p></body></html>

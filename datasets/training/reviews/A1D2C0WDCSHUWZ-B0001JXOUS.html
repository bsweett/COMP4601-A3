Stir in cliches and do not season at all. The result? "The Last Samurai," a very dull, colorless action flick set in Japan. It's not a good sign when the New Zealand scenery is the most striking thing about the whole thing.<br /><br />It's the mid-1800s and times are a-changin' in Japan -- the modernization of the west (meaning the USA) is sweeping away the old ways. The Emperor gets an American veteran named Nathan Algren to help train his troops. Algren is an alcoholic, filled with angst because he killed American Indians, and he hates his new job.<br /><br />Suddenly he's captured during an attack by samurai Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) and dragged back to his village. After going cold turkey, he begins to appreciate the old samurai code and ways, and begins to fall in love with a beautiful widow. Taking the side of his new allies, he sets out on a seemingly doomed attack, against the very people he was sent to help... and his own troops.<br /><br />Even taken out of the historical context, "Last Samurai" is a deeply annoying film. It's laced with heavy-handed political correctness, complete with pointless insertions about American Indians and Custer. It's also  saddled with a surreally optimistic ending. Everying about it -- from Cruise's love interest to his change of heart -- is predictable, cliched and very corny.<br /><br />While the film is SET in Japan, the actual shooting took place in New Zealand, giving it a lush, almost fantastical backdrop for all the action. Certainly it makes director Edward Zwick's job a bit easier, even if the film is saddled with some very stilted dialogue. ("And though it may forever be obscure to me, I cannot but be aware of its power.") And enough with the "Bob" comments.<br /><br />Tom Cruise shows little emotion, and his character's alcoholic angst is almost laughably contrived. In fact, you may cheer when he gets beaten up. Ken Watanabe is what makes the film -- he has the presence of a future screen legend, and he plays Katsumoto with vulnerabilities and real feelings. This guy deserves to be the lead of such a film. Koyuki also shows incredible expressiveness as the widow Taka.<br /><br />For a well-acted, well-directed film that happens to be set in Japan, check out the immortal samurai films by Kurosawa. Even merely taken on its own, "Last Samurai" is swamped in its own sense of self-importance. Watanabe and New Zealand are the best things about this film.</p></body></html>

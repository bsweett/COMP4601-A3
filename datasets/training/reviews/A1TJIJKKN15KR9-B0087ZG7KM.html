<meta name="summary" content="Raunchy and Raucous, Bridesmaids Can't Shake its Feminine Core"></head><body><p>A genuinely funny script that didn't really need to go the gross-out route, it doesn't suffer for choosing to do so anyway. At its best during a rapid-fire first hour, the humor cools off noticeably when the drama llama rears its head during the home stretch, like it suddenly decided not to fully commit to any one specific identity. Though it occasionally presses too far over the line separating awkward humor and legitimate discomfort, the flick's lively, personable cast is never far off, life preserver tucked under one arm. Loaded with all-stars from every corner of the comedy spectrum, the jokes are delivered with predictable credibility, with many cast members also showing a surprisingly strong set of dramatic chops to boot. Despite a sappy, lovesick ending that seems to stand in contrast to its initial character, this is a witty, charming, raunchy little bundle of joy that's as good as you've probably heard, no more and no less.</p></body></html>

The same can also be said of other films such as In Cold Blood and Bonnie and Clyde. The film is an art form. To me at least, the objective as a reviewer is to comment as honestly and as thoughtfully as possible on any film as a work of art. Having recently seen Monster and then City of God, I view both as works of great art. Hence my Five Star rating of each. This review is composed prior to the announcement of those who are to receive Academy Awards. Either Theron or Diane Keaton would be a worthy recipient as best actress in a leading role but my preference is Theron. She commands our attention from her first to last appearance on screen. For me, she IS Wuornos. Moreover, I cannot recall another a character in another film whom she resembles. As portrayed by Theron, Wuornos is passionate, delusional, pathetic, frightening, vulnerable, and on occasion touching. I never expect to understand fully (or even partially) why Aileen Wuornos -- in real life, not in the film -- behaved as she did. Too much happened -- and did not happen -- in her life which is not revealed or even implied in this film. Who is the "monster"? Is it Wuornos? Is it the society into which she was born and within which she evolved to womanhood? Whom to blame? What to blame? Should any blame be assigned, other than responsibility for the murders committed? To repeat, I do NOT condone the behavior portrayed in this film even as I admire so much what Patty Jenkins achieves as director as well as the achievements of her cast and crew. For 109 minutes, I was fully engaged in -- not merely watching -- human experiences wholly unrelated to anything I had ever experienced in my own life. Perhaps this is what a film makes possible...and a movie does not. Perhaps therein is the difference between art and artifact. As these comments no doubt suggest, I am still absorbing and digesting what I have seen. This much I do know: I will never forget my brief visit to Aileen Wuornos' world but have no desire to return to it .</p></body></html>

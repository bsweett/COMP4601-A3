<meta name="summary" content="Carrie"></head><body><p>Based on Stephen King's book, this horror outing finds director de Palma at his twisted best. Spacek is perfect as the diminutive blonde bombshell set to detonate, Laurie causes involuntary shudders playing Carrie's deranged Mom, and you can't wait to see all those nasty adolescents at school get what's coming to them.( This group includes future stars John Travolta, Nancy Allen and Amy Irving). The concluding prom scene is one of the great sequences in all horror films. An inspired choice for Halloween.</p></body></html>

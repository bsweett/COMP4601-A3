<meta name="summary" content="Pleae remember that this is a movie from a novel."></head><body><p>It is not a history book. If you object to it on religious grounds you certainly don't want to pique interest causing many people to rush out to see (or read) it. Faith does not trump facts or history. In The Da Vinci Code we may be dealing with pseudo-history. The idea that Jesus Christ, a Jewish man married as was Jewish custom, & had a child is more acceptable to me than a pagan Roman Emperor declaring Jesus divine 300 years after his death, with a book heavily edited by wealthy, white men concerned with holding on to their power.<br />  That said, enjoy this movie for the thriller it is with an interesting quest. There are a few twist & turns & it is pretty true to the book. The ending can be seen a mile off however. The makers of this movie played it safe casting Tom Hanks as the star. Someone a little less homogenized might have been preferred. But the carping by Catholics & others have guaranteed success.</p></body></html>

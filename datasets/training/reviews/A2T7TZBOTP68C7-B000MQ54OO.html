<meta name="summary" content="Takes Risks for an Animated Film"></head><body><p>We all complain when a movie is formulaic and takes no risks, such as Shark Tale.  So when a movie like Happy Feet comes along, we must award props for originality and newness.<br /><br />Happy Feet is the story of Mumble (Elijah Wood) who loves to tap dance.  He does not have the innate ability of his brother penguins, who use a heartsong to attract a mate.  Ostracized except for his friend Gloria (Brittany Murphy), he strays and becomes lost in a foreign penguin colony.  These penguins love to dance and he becomes the leader of five spunky Chicano penguins (Ramon voiced by Robin Williams, who also voices the Macaroni penguin).  His return to his home colony is less than triumphant, and he leaves again for good, on a quest to find out the source of the missing fish.<br /><br />The music soundtrack is delightful.  I love Nicole Kidman as Mumble's mother, Norma Jean.  She is a sexy singer.  The way she meets her husband Memphis (Hugh Jackman), is true love.<br /><br />Now we come to the environmental message.  It is all true that fish stocks are severely depleted and that the ocean environment is suffering.  The controversy is, does such a strong message belong in a children's movie?  That is up to the viewer to decide, but for me, it was a little heavy after all the precious, cuddly gray baby Emperor penguins and lighthearted music.  The way Mumble goes out on his quest is ultra-serious.  His eyes at one point look just like Frodo on his journey to get The Ring of Sauron.<br /><br />The movie even takes digs at religion, which is not cool.  So children will love this movie, but their parents may be disturbed by the underlying social-political messages.</p></body></html>

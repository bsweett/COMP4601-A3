<meta name="summary" content="The "It's A Wonderful Life" of the 60's generation"></head><body><p>Forrest Gump is an absolutely brilliant film that captures the 60's and the early 70's in the same way that Frank Capra's wonderful film did for the WWII generation.<br /><br />Seeing events through the eyes of a simple man like Gump allows the film to explore the entire social revolution, vietnam war, race relations and everything that made the 60's so volatile without being judgemental or preachy.<br /><br />Ultimately Gump though simple remains grounded in his values and his worldview that he largely got from basic moral teachings his mother gave him while the world around him goes more than a bit crazy.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is just a great film and the acting of Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Sally Fields and others couldn't be better. One of those rare movies that hits on all cylinders.</p></body></html>

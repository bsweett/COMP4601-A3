<meta name="summary" content="Give this Movie a Chance"></head><body><p>Almost every film I see, I know everything about it before I see it. I know what it's about, I know who is in it, and I know what critics and audiences think of it. I saw "The Black Dahlia" in the theatre the day it came out and enjoyed it. Then I began reading the reviews for it and I was like "what the hell?" Nobody likes this movie, for various reasons. It's not as good as the book, it tries to be a film-noir and fails, the acting is bad, and, my favorite reason for hating it, Scarlett Johansson is in it. I've seen the movie three times now...This last time after reading the book and, yes, granted the book is a lot better. This film is not half as bad as it's made out to be though. First off, yes it's not just trying to pay homage to film-noir. It's trying to be a film-noir and it's not. The acting isn't bad, but some of it is campy. And Scarlett Johansson is a very talented and very hot actress. First off, the dialogue in the film is pretty close to the dialogue in the book. It worked very well in the book, but has its ups-and-downs in the movie for several reasons. No one in the movie truly seems comfortable with the dialogue. It's 40s-esque dialogue and you got people who have been in movies like Erin Brockovich, Lost in Translation, and Dumb & Dumber reciting it. The story is one of two films released in 2006 that are fictional stories built on the foundation of a true-life crime story (the other being "Hollywoodland" a superior film). Josh Hartnett plays Dwight<br /><br />"Bucky" Bleichert, a boxer turned LAPD detective dubbed Mr. Ice. Aaron Eckhart plays Lee Blanchard, also a boxer turned LAPD detective dubbed Mr. Fire. To get a proposition passed and score a spot in the Warrants division, Blanchard and Bleichert duke it out and become local celebrities. Soon, they're both working Warrants and find themselves partners. Soon, their duo becomes a trio when Kay Lake (Johansson), Blanchard's girlfriend comes into the mix. But then their lives change forever when a mutilated corpse is found in a vacant lot. The corpse is of a woman, who has been cut in half at the waist, disemboweled, and has had a grisly smile carved onto her face ear-to-ear. The body is Elizabeth Short, dubbed "The Black Dahlia" because of her tendency to wear all black. This is an unsolved murder that really occurred, but almost everything in the movie involving her murder is fictitious. The woman's murder sets Blanchard off and causes him to alienate his friends and family while he obsessively searches for her killer. Bleichert, meanwhile, does his own investigation which leads him to meet Madeleine Linscott (Hilary Swank), the daughter of a rich construction tycoon who bares a remarkable resemblance to The Dahlia. The last 20 minutes of the film weren't handled very well. Many of these scenes are creepy and well filmed, while others are campy. Especially the long-winded monologue delivered by Madeleine's mother Ramona (Fiona Shaw). The acting is really the weak point of the film, but not all of it is bad. Hartnett, Johansson, and Eckhart aren't terrible. Oddly enough, the weakest link is two-time Oscar winner Swank, who looks good for the part but gives a weak performance. Listen closely (maybe not too closely) and you'll hear her trying on a rich-uppity kind of accent. Then you'll hear that accent fade and then suddenly return. In the book, it mentions the character tries to sound like The Black Dahlia (which would be a Boston accent). But what Swank is doing is not a Boston accent. Was it supposed to be? Whatever...The movie scored an Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography, which I think it deserves. It does catch the atmosphere James Ellroy had in his novel pretty well, but it just doesn't roll with it as far as plot. You have to realize, also, how far the movie differed from the book. It took over a hundred pages before they find the body of Elizabeth Short. In the movie, it takes twenty minutes. The movie is good though and I'm surprised so many people hate it. I think if you were to walk into it with an open mind and no preconceived notion (like I did), you'll enjoy it. It's certainly better than two stars...There's people on Amazon who like "Date Movie" more than this. I think this movie is a lot better than some more acclaimed Brian De Palma films. Even if you didn't like this film the first time, I beg you to give it another chance.<br /><br />GRADE: B</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I love Stanley Kubrick"></head><body><p>There are so many lines of this movie which have become part of the American Experience, yet so many people have no idea where they come from.  When you try to explain this movie, they often get it mixed up with Platoon and other movies about Nam.  However, I feel no one has captured the true feel, contradiction, frustration, confusion, and absurdity of the Vietnam War like Kubrick did in this movie.  The only way your friends will understand it, is to see it, unless they were there.</p></body></html>

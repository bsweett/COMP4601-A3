<meta name="summary" content="A film that psyches itself out!"></head><body><p>1408(released in June/07) stars John Cusack & Samuel Jackson in this film based on a Stephen King short story released in /99.The film works well until shortly after we enter room 1408,then it starts to regress into a cliche ridden,been there done that,spook story.<br />Author Mike Enslin(Cusack)is a moderately successful writer who has written a few books on ghosts and apparitions.He visits hotels,motels and houses that are supposedly haunted,well equipped with the latest in technology so he can document everything he experiences.However Mike is so far a skeptic,as he has never experienced anything approaching the paranormal in his travels.He returns to his home in California and goes surfing,only to experience a rather violent wave wash-over while trying to read a banner being pulled by a plane.Returning home he is sorting through his  mail when a postcard with the Dolphin Hotel in NYC,catches his eye.The writing on the back says NOT to visit room 1408 there.Intrigued he phones and tries to book it but has no success.He phones his publisher who in turn brings in a lawyer and between the three of them,they manage to get the room booked.<br />He arrives at the Dolphin a few days later and is greeted by the hotel manager Mr.Olin(Jackson),who begs him not to stay in the room because it is evil.Mike will not be talked out of it and the manager personally escorts him up the elevator to the floor,but will not see him down the hall to the room itself.Mike enters the room to find a rather well appointed older style decor.Always with his personal tape recorder in hand,he talks his notes out,describing the surroundings as mundane and frustratingly waiting to put in another fruitless night.Slowly but surely things start to happen in increments,like chocolates appearing on his pillow,the toilet paper end arranged neatly and a painting going crooked.Suddenly the clock radio comes to life blaring out the Carpenters "We've only just Begun".When the room temperature rises to unbearable degrees,he calls a maintenance man who comes but won't step inside the door.After he hurriedly leaves and the door is shut the radio comes on again;he pulls it out but the time revs forward and stops at 60 minutes,only to start clocking slowly backwards.The game is on baby.<br />Numerous specters of guests past,walk through the room,he tries to leave by walking out on the ledge to the next room but the next room disappears into never ending brick,he sees and talks to his dead daughter and father.We slowly find out that Mike carries alot of emotional baggage with the disintegration of his marriage because of his daughters death with cancer.Mike then desperately uses his laptop to contact his wife for help.This is cut short when the sprinklers go off.He tries to get out through the vent shafts above only to be chased back by an undead figure.A painting of a ship foundering in a storm comes to life and it floods the room with water.He goes under and resurfaces only to find himself back on that same beach in California that he was at when he was washed-over previously.He now can read the plane banner and the phone number on it ends with 1408.He ends up in the hospital with his wife by his side as he tries to make sense of what happened.She tells him to write about his experience,and when he does and is finished, he goes to the local post office to mail the transcript.However the employee who serves him tells him that he can't because they're closed.He recognizes him from the Dolphin Hotel and as he looks around at the construction crew,they are also from the hotel.They start into ripping the walls down to reveal room 1408 of the hotel.He has never left but re-enters it.The room now is blackened out from a fire.<br />His daughter appears and there is a tearful reunion with her but she suddenly crumbles to dust as the clock radio comes back on and the room returns to normal.Mike grabs a cognac bottle given to him by Olin and makes a Molotov Cocktail out of it and sets the room on fire.The room erupts in screams as the flames engulf the entire room.Firefighters rescue Mike and he is taken to the hospital.Mike has escaped,but barely.As he sits at his desk at home listening to his burnt tape recorder with his wife,the voice of his deceased daughter comes on and both stare at each other in disbelief.Fade to black.<br />The film builds wonderfully up until the moment the radio blasts out the Carpenter song.From there on in the movie becomes filled with cliches with the walking specters,the hot and cold room,the room filling with water,his disorientation,the taps scalding him,the walls issuing forth blood and so on and so on.The writers here went to great lengths to scare us but in the end,they just end up psyching themselves out by overcompensating with the special effects and muddying the haunted waters,by combining the occult with Mike's closet skeletons.Both main stars do wonderful jobs in their respective roles,with the film eventually turning into a one man show for Cusack;and he certainly was up for the task.It is just too bad the script wasn't.<br />Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its original a/r of 2:40:1.Extras include shorts on Inside room 1408,an interview with various stars on the film and the trailer.<br />All in all a decent film of yet another Stephen King story,but expanded to lengths not necessary in order to scare.The film is strong up until shortly after he arrives in room 1408,then it goes downhill in plot and scare factor.It becomes a little too cliched and obvious with the main characters foibles thrown into the mix.But Cusack and Jackson are strong actors and they compensate for the films flaws as best as they can under the circumstances.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Too Long and Confusing - Depp/Cruz and the Mermaids Saved It From 1 or 2 Stars"></head><body><p>I think this series has definitely run its course. I love Johny Depp, but even his charms cannot save this film. The plot is basically another variation on the treasure hunt, although this time they are looking for the fountain of youth. Capt. Barbossa, played again by Geoffrey Rush, is also after it, allied with the British crown. Blackbeard, played by Ian McShane, is the third contender and he's accompanied by his daughter, played by Penelope Cruz. Although it's basically a simple plot, there are various twists and turns that are hard to follow, partly because of the strong accents. My husband couldn't follow it all, having not seen the prior film, and I'm not sure I did either. It also simply dragged on too long - it seemed a little caught up in itself, and the cast seemed a little caught up in themselves (most of the time having more fun than us I suspect.)<br /><br />The settings and special effects are great though, as they have been in the other films. A mermaid scene is especially impressive, and helped save this film from 1 or 2 star status for me. I also liked the chemistry between Cruz and Depp, and their interactions were a highlight of the film. So it's a 3 star for me. I think I'm done with this franchise though, I hope the studio agrees.</p></body></html>

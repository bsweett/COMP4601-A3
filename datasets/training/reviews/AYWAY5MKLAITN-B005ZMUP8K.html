I saw the midnight showing of this movie and let me tell you that it was TOTALLY AWESOME!!!!! Who wouldn't enjoy this movie?!<br /><br />This movie is not just another plot, the same characters and all that jazz. This movie picks up right where the original left off. In fact, this time there are new baddies. You'll find out how captain Jack became a captain, you'll find out why his compass does not work, you'll find out what Davy jones has to do with it.<br /><br />In this movie there is heavy swashbuckling, gigantic sets, hilarious jokes, and more rum. It makes you feel like a kid again to see these characters outwit, stumble, and get back up again. It even had an Indianna Jones type feel to it. And a real plus is the fact that Captain Jack Sparrow hasn't changed at all. At not one moment did Johnny depp depart from the persona of this funny bugsbunny/groucho marx character. Yes, in this movie, his part is somewhat trimmed but that's even better. the writers of this movie are brilliant, becuase having his screen time trimmed just means that you're that much eager to see the next scene with him in it.<br /><br />But I'd have to say that the real thing that sold me on this movie was the last 10 minutes of the end! It will totally warp your mind but you will be thrilled when you see it! I was completely shocked and giddy when I saw the end and so were my friends!<br /><br />It's a pirate movie that you do not want to miss!<br /><br />It's been only one day since the movie has been out and already people want to see Pirates of the Carribean: At World's End right away.<br /><br />Captain Jack Is back, Mates!!! And he's better than ever!!!!</p></body></html>

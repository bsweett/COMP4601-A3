<meta name="summary" content="Extra Features for the DVD are announced"></head><body><p>Almost one hundred people have reviewed this film so far, and I can't really add much to what's been said as to the plot and quality of the film. I believe it to be the best film of 2007, and one I'd actually like to own, which is a rarity these days with all of the CGI-laden plot-poor films that fill the theaters. The Coens have always been the creators of some of my favorite modern films, with their odd choice of topics and even odder takes on those odd situations. This film is no exception. The following is the list of special features for the DVD:<br /><br />2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen<br />English DD5.1 Surround<br />French and Spanish subtitles<br />Working with the Coens: Reflections of Cast and Crew - Learn more about Joel and Ethan Coen from the perspective of their collaborators, cast and crew.<br />The Making of No Country For Old Men - Take a journey through the Coen Brothers' process and back to their roots as storytellers with a unique voice and vision.<br />Diary of a Country Sheriff - Explore the relationship between the compassion of Sheriff Bell and the brutality of Anton Chigurh.<br /><br />That's right - there's no commentary track. The Coen Bros. films have rarely come with very many extras.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great to see Dinos get to the big screen."></head><body><p>JP doesn't have much in the way of a story.<br />It really didn't need one.<br />Everyone went to see the scary dinos.<br />And Speilberg succeeds yet again, delivering the thrills and chills at a breakneck pace.<br />The story?<br />Genitically engineered dinos.<br />That's the story, basically.<br />If your looking for "Gone With The Wind" with dinos, your looking in the wrong place.<br />Action, action and more action.<br />This is a must have / must see movie.<br />RECOMMENDED!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Dream...or a Nightmare??"></head><body><p>One of the most surprising and enticing movies of the last years, this cult classic (yes, it`s a modern classic already) presents a superb and unforgettable perspective about the nature of addiction (not just drugs). <p>Darren Aronofsky delivers some cutting-edge moments here, managing to offer terrific camera-angles with a powerful, fluid photography and an urban, hypnotic soundtrack. He`s one of the most promising directors around, resembling David Fincher, Chris Nolan or Richard Kelly due to his videoclip-like cinematography. <p>The plot focuses the lives of four alienated and lonely individuals whose experiences with addiction lead them to a downward spiral, generating a couple of astonishing and surreal scenes. &quot;Trainspotting&quot; was one of the essential movies of the nineties, as it delivered a new perspective on drugs and its effects, but &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is equally impressive, creative and original, presenting multiple memorable moments worth rewatching. <p>Its non-linear structure may be confusing at parts, some characters are not fully developed and the overall tone of the film is way too depressing (even a bit pretentious), still &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; shines as a respectable and strong achievement nonetheless.<br />This is independent filmaking at its best, a rich and multi-layered cinematic experience that doesn`t disappoint.<p>Highly Recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Should have been better"></head><body><p>It is 1935, and wealthy Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightly) loves Robbie (James McAvoy), the housekeeper's son.  A scandalous accusation against him by Cecilia's little sister separates the two lovers.  And then, the War begins.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie.  I'd heard it was a grand love story played out against the agonizing backdrop of World War II.  Well, it left me cold.  I didn't feel anything for Cecilia or her sister (they both seemed pretty shallow and spoiled to me), and although James McAvoy is handsome and sincere, I didn't know enough about Robbie to care about him.  The movie's first third is shown in quick scenes with dialogue that wasn't always easy to understand.  It was rather perfunctory and, with no backstory to show how this love developed or what they are like as people, I didn't connect with anyone.<br /><br />The manor house set is lovely, and the war scenes are well-done and suitably grizzly, but the story just didn't pull me in.  I was disappointed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good Solid Work"></head><body><p>For some reason, as the money came in, the quality decreased with Robert Rodriguez's Mexico Trilogy (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ASDFI6">Robert Rodriguez Mexico Trilogy (El Mariachi / Desperado / Once Upon A Time In Mexico)</a>).  The first is still the best.  The second one is pretty good too.  But this one is missing something.  Something that made the first two such a novelty.<br /><br />The strong cast does everything in their power to carry this movie, especially the new addition Johnny Depp.  It's got an interesting premise, but the execution seems to be the problem.  It's still quite fun to watch.<br /><br />This DVD features a commentary with Robert Rodriguez, deleted scenes, a few featurettes detailing the picture's production, and a 10 minute film school with Rodriguez.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

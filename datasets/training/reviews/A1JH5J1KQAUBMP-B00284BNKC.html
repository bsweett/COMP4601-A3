<meta name="summary" content="Painful and powerful"></head><body><p>Writer/director Darren Aronofsky's (with co-writer Hubert Selby, Jr., based on his novel) harrowing film is a study of addiction in all its forms-not just addiction to drugs, but also to television, dreams, fame, sugar, and sex.  Harry (Jared Leto) and Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are a couple buddies who hustle drugs and get high together; they even manage to set money aside and feel like they are making successes of themselves in their own way.  They discover how precarious their position really is when the supply of drugs in their area dries up and they are forced to go on the road to find more.  Marion (Jennifer Connolly) is Harry's beautiful girlfriend, who squanders money from her wealthy family while she feeds her addiction and dreams of opening a boutique with Harry's help.  Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is Harry's na?ve mother, whose belief that she will appear on an infomercial leads her into an addiction to diet pills in an effort to lose weight.<br /><br />Each of these characters is sustained by a dream that enables them to use drugs, believing that it is a temporary stage on their way to a brighter future.  By the end of the film, all of their dreams have been cruelly but unavoidably crushed and the characters themselves have spiraled into their separate lonely hells.  It's not easy to watch because the talented cast invests their characters with much compassion.<br /><br />Don't see this film if you are one of those people who believes that all movies should make us feel good.  But do see it if you believe films should make us feel deeply./</p></body></html>

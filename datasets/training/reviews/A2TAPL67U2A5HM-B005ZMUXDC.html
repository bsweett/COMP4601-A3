<meta name="summary" content="Tangled (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)"></head><body><p>Tangled (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo) being Disney's 50th animated movie is a movie about Rapunzel who has spent all her life locked in a tower. One day an intruder enters her "world" and the adventure begins. The music is amazing and the animation likewise. A movie worthy of Disney and a true gem for children and animated movie fans alike. I loved it. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.</p></body></html>

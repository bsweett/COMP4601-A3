This film tries so hard to be edgy, provocative, and clever but the director fails to achieve any kind of dark humor. Reese Witherspoon plays against type and even though Bale is a talented actor, I just feel this role doesn't do anything for him. There are some graphic and grotesque images in American Psycho, not for the faint of heart. I just couldn't stand this movie, pretty ordinary.</p></body></html>

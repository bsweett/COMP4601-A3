<meta name="summary" content="Harry Potter magic"></head><body><p>I think Chamber of Secrets is a step back from the first and third movie.  It begins on a high note but turns dry 45 minutes later ("dry" by Potter standards).  From that point, it never really recovers.  However, the mysterious story and the dark atmosphere (in some moments, overwhelming darkness not far from a horror flick!) really make it stand out from the other Potter movies.  Probably my least favorite of the Potter films but worth buying indeed.</p></body></html>

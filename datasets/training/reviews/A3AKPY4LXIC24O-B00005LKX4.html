Besides, everyone was there for the title character anyway and this time there's definitely more for Lecter to chew on.<br /><br />Another plus was the haunting performance given by Gary Oldman.  I can't help but think that this film would have been award bound if Foster had agreed to reprise her role as Starling.  While Moore did an admirable job different people playing the same role only works on stage.  Ridley Scott's direction is, as always, astounding(I'm still irked by his inexcusable loss to Soderbergh in 2000).<br /><br />Hannial is even better the second time around as you are less shocked and more capable of noticing the nuances each actor brings to their roles.  I still don't understand how Anthony Hopkins didn't at least get another Oscar nod.<br /><br />If you saw The Silence of the Lambs you should at least rent Hannibal, if only to see Hopkins as the good doctor.  Also, for you sickos out there Hannibal has one of the most disturbing endings ever in a widely released theatrical film.<br /><br />Bon Appetit!</p></body></html>

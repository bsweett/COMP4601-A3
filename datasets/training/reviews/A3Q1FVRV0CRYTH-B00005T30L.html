When I was in school I was the social outcast, the uncool kid who hated everyone around him because they were too normal.  It's just so funny to watch a movie like `Ghost World' and think about my own high-school days.  The entire cast, notably the two female stars Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson turn in brilliant performances as best friends whose lives change shortly after graduating high-school.<br /><br />Thora stars as Enid, the social outcast who hates everyone and everything normal in her peers and finds her only sense of comfort in playing cruel pranks of those she feels unworthy.  Her latest prank includes Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a 40ish vintage record collector who is lonely and reclusive and is seeking female companionship through an add in the paper.  What Enid never expected is that she would develop a crush on this man who is "the opposite of everything I completely hate."<br /><br />As Enid's relationship with Seymour develops her relationship with her best friend Becky (Scarlett Johansson) begins to suffer.  Her negativity to everything associated with Becky and their plans is starting to push them apart.  Becky is trying to establish a life apart from the dependency of her parents roof, getting a job, an apartment, but Enid and her uncertain and complete fickleness is driving a wedge into those plans.<br /><br />Complete with that perfect deadpan sarcasm that laces almost every word, and the brilliant dry expression-ridden performances that only `accentuate the negative', `Ghost World' works on every level to deliver a brilliant comedy that is bound to please all who watch it.</p></body></html>

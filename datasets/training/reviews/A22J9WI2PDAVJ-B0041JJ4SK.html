<meta name="summary" content="Can't get enough of those sliders!"></head><body><p>The reviews are in! Who cares what all of the so called reviewers think! They all tend to think too much. (I`ll raise my hand.) Toke up and watch this unrated DVD again. Then write your review over.<br /><br />What did you get? Did it change your mind? Okay, now rewrite!<br /><br />Well now that I'm clear of mind. Harold and Kumar gave me some laughs. In this day an age it seems Hollywood cannot come up with a comedy classic mega hit. Sure there are some good comedic hits to come out recently like "Old School" and "Van Wilder", but nothing that can compare to the vintage "Cheech & Chong", "Animal House" and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" classics.<br /><br />Harold & Kumar features male bonding, road trips, fatuitous jokes and of course nudity. Harold (John Cho) is an investment banker. Kumar (Kal Penn) is Harold's roommate. Friday night is smoke night, but the usual fast food delivery just won't work on this night. White Castle's commercial is the only choice (Optimal timing) to satisfy their hunger.  (Hence the road trip.) I say who hasn't had a road trip to a late night fast food joint?<br /><br />(This road trip is totally believable because of mouth watering White Castle's burger. Have you had pleasure of tasting White Castle's sliders? If not, you are definitely missing out. I suggest your own road trip.)<br /><br />The race of the main characters does add some racial jokes, but does not deter the viewer into an ulterior, underlying motive. The Director (Danny Leiner) goes for the laughs first.<br /><br />This unrated DVD is one to put in the view under the influence category. Doogie Howser (Neil Patrick Harris) makes a special appearance to tell the world he is still available for work. Buddy Lee and Anthony Anderson also make cameos.</p></body></html>

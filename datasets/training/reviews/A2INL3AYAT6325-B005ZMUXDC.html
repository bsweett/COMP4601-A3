<meta name="summary" content="Good not great try Disney TERRIBLE DVD PACKAGE"></head><body><p>After a decade of disappointing Disney films (NOT talking with Pixar) with only "Lilo and Stitch" as the only hit Disney decided to go back to tried & true.<br /><br />And, did they.<br /><br />It is a good film.  There is humor.  Supporting characters that we more exciting than the main characters.  That would be Maximus & Pascal.  Stole one name from "Gladiator"? We got back into regular Disney music for a film.  That is a plus, BUT which is major.  None of the songs are memorable.  I can NOT remember any of them after the film.<br /><br />Is colorful.<br /><br />When I wrote above about tried & true. I mean it.  You see several scenes here that were taken from both "Beauty and the Beast" & "Snow White.  When the film started I thought I was watching "Beauty and the Beast".  The superior film of course, "Snow White" again superior and the one that started the full length  animated films.<br /><br />The good guy is first a heal, hey Disney how about I saw that in "The Princess and the Frog"?<br /><br />So, it was a good try & a good film Disney.  Just NOT a bulls eye.<br /><br />NOW, THE COMPLAINT I HAVE WITH DISNEY NOW.  They think EVERYONE has a blu/ray player.  I do NOT.  Can NOT afford one or the discs.  So, Disney does NOT care about regular DVD's anymore.  There is only one extra on this and it is for kids.<br /><br />And, for a colorful film why a plain Jane silver disc Disney?  Cheap.  For a colorful film, beautiful animation a plain silver disc.<br /><br />Cutting corners does NOT make people customers happy Disney.  Disney has gone cheap, NOT the way to make money Disney.  I hope your company AGAIN uses sales because of these cheap tricks.<br /><br />Disney, you want to make money.  KEEP YOUR CUSTOMERS HAPPY.</p></body></html>

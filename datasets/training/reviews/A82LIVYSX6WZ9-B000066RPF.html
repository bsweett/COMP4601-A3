<meta name="summary" content="a damn brilliant and addictive comedy."></head><body><p>by far the best comedy period on my list. I laughed my love handles off watching this movie. my friends were right and I thank them for letting me see it. it's really, really great with awesome charcters like The Knights who say "nee!", Tim the Enchanter, The Killer Bunny, The old man at the bridge of death.<p>favorite part in that whole movie is when they meet the killer bunny. There are some other hilarious and memoriable parts like the Castle Anthrax with all the horned up maidens who want spankings and oral sex and the holy hand grnade of antioch. If anyone doesnt like this movie they ought to be shot.<p>French man- " I fart in your general direction. Your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of eldeberries!"<p>a damn addictive movie. LOVE IT</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The things Bill Nye the Science Guy never told us about"></head><body><p>The premise of Splice is pretty simple. Two scientists looking for a cure to mankind's most horrid diseases, mix human DNA in their splicing of animal genes. Instead of killing their creation, they decide to raise it. Then the you know what hits the fan. It's basically a better version of the the film Species. I know one features a really hot alien from space and this creature is created in the lab, but it has that same sexy vibe. You can tell the director, Vincenzo Natali, who also directed the cult favorite, Cube, really tried to make the audience feel uncomfortable with a few really twisted scenes. I was expecting something a little more shocking after reading some reviews, but perhaps watching Spartacus: Blood and Sand has left little room for surprise, at least for me.<br /><br />The movie relies on three performances and they are all very good. Other than the fact I find Adrien Brody hard to look at, he and Sarah Polley play the roles so seriously, you can't help but believe every word they say. There are a few situations where they do typical dumb things, but the dialogue and acting were believable most of the time. The creature named Dren, which looks more human than animal and ages rapidly, is a fantastic design. The early stages of it's life are all done with CGI, which is the least convincing, but once it hits the teen years, Delphine Chan&eacute;ac, takes over and really breathes some life into the character. Dren has odd shaped hands, legs and feet, no hair, communicates by squeaking, sprouts wings at will, has a long tail with a sharp tip, and has eyes set as far apart as possible while still remaining on the front of her face. Oh, and her name is nerd spelled backwards.<br /><br />The gore is really kept to a minimum. I thought there would be a little more red being thrown around than what you would see in a PG-13 movie. I won't spoil it, but there is a very weird sex scene and even a quick scene of rape towards the end, that got this film an R rating, along with the language. There was more violence and gore in Drag Me to Hell. I also didn't like the last 15 minutes that much. It felt a little rushed and turned into nothing more than a typical creature feature.<br /><br />Splice is not a great horror film, but it's a pretty good one, that shouldn't be missed once it hits Blu-ray.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A serial killer who wants to reform but gets dragged back into action. Strong performances a highlight of  unusual "Mr. Brooks"."></head><body><p>A well made unusual thriller "Mr Brooks" features Kevin Costner in the title role in a fascinating conceit--serial killing is like an addiction and like addicts Mr. Brooks believes he can reform.  Although the various subplots don't always quite gel, "Mr. Brooks" is still a fascinating thriller with a trio of strong performances. Costner's performance is a complete contrast to Anthony Hopkins turn as Hannibal Lecter which, along with the unusual approach to the character, gives "Mr. Brooks" a very refreshing take on a popular subject.<br /><br />Like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6GUW0">Dexter - The First Season</a>, "Mr. Brooks" takes an unusual approach to its subject that pays off in the end.  I have to give Evans and Gideon credit for such an ambitious film tweaking Costner's nice-guy personna. Even if the two parts don't fit together seamlessly, "Mr. Brooks" is still a terrific thriller that coasts along on the strong performances of the actors even when the film doesn' quite gel. I was a bit surprised by the negative critical reaction to the film given the strong writing and performances.<br /><br />SPOILERS IN THE NEXT TWO PARAGRAPHS:<br /><br />What's a conflicted serial killer who wants to just be "normal" to do when he's forced to kill again a blackmailer? Or does Mr. Brooks (Kevin Costner giving a terrific performance) want to give up killing? He says he does and yet he and his alter ego Marshall (William Hurt equally marvelous)slip opening the door to a fan "Mr. Smith" (Dane Cook in an excellent oily, slimy performance)a wanna-be serial killer that wants to learn the tricks of the trade.<br /><br />The problem is that Mr. Brooks has Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore)a troubled cop that wants to put him behind bars. Complications result when his daughter returns from college with a dark secret of her own.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />Directed and co-written by Bruce Evans ("Stand By Me", "Starman")and William Gideon, this psychological thriller is well worth a rental if nothing else. The DVD has some nice extras--there's a featurette "The Birth of a Serial Killer: The Writing of Mr. Brooks" where Evans and Gideon discuss the genesis of the project and how they really wanted to get away from the sweet and adolescent ensemble films they had written in the past.<br /><br />We also get "Murder on Their Minds: Mr. Brooks, Marshall and Mr. Smith" which allows the Costner, Hurt and Cook to discuss their characters and their approach to playing the roles.<br /><br />We also get a commentary track with Evans & Gideon. They make some pretty intelligent observations about the film and how it turned out. We also get deleted scenes as part of the package.<br /><br />although "Mr. Brooks" is flawed by two very different tones for its plot and subplot (the latter feels like it was lifted from a different movie), Evans and Gideon manage to bring it together to a surprisingly firm and powerful conclusion. The performances of Costner, Hurt, Cook and a scenery chewing Moore will pull in viewers.</p></body></html>

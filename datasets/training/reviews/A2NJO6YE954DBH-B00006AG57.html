<meta name="summary" content="Ever wonder what WWF Wrestling would be like with swords?"></head><body><p>I am so confused.  I know the Rock played a character called the Scorpion King in "The Mummy Returns," which was supposed to set up this film.  But the character has gone from a silent, brooding warrior of great strength and skill to a wisecracking, snarling warrior of great strength and skill.  Did I miss something?  At least in "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" they explained how the character went from being the villain to the hero.  No such explanation is offered here for what I thought was a similar transition.  Then again, maybe I am guilty of thinking, which is not a prerequisite skill for watching this film.<p>Ironically, you might enjoy this film more if you have not seen "The Mummy Returns," especially if you are a devotee of WWF wrestling, the arena in which the Rock originally perfected his eyebrow arching technique.  The story is set way before the pyramids were build, when the original Scorpion King, Memnon (Steven Brand) was the best swordsman on the planet and used the prophetic talents of a sorceress (Kelly Hu) to rule the known desert.  Going up against him are the Arkadians, a group of professional assassins, of which Mathayus (the Rock) is the best and the brightest.  He is aided by a giant Nubian (Michael Clarke Duncan) is what is certainly an homage to the legendary friendship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu (sorry, I was thinking again).  Anyhow, "The Scorpion King" is clearly a standard action adventure in which the hero has to kill the bad guy, win the woman, and rule happily ever after.  <p>It dawns on me that this film is similar to "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."  That film made Hong Kong wire work a part of the Hollywood cinematic repertoire, where as this film does the same for WWF Wrestling techniques.  This film is not happy unless it is going over the top.  When our hero shoots somebody with an arrow in this film the result is comparable to having used a small tactical missile: they are sent flying through the wall.  The film certainly delivers exactly what you would expect, high energy heroics at breakneck speed, but a bit more creativity would have been nice.  At least the dialogue knows it is supposed to be either tongue in cheek or painfully bad, so you cannot hold that against the film.  The Rock delivers the performance demanded by his fans, so that is not going to be grounds for big complaints either.  I did enjoy the film, more than I thought I would, but the ultimate standard for an action film is your desire to watch it again and again, and on that critical score "The Scorpion King" falls short</p></body></html>

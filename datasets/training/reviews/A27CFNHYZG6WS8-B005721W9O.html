I'm not too enamoured of the actors involved either, although Sam Rockwell is splendid as the Everyman guiding us through the tricky switches between 'fantasy' and 'reality'.  <p>But 'Quest' is available to more than just Trekkies or Tim Allen admirers.  The (presumably) intentionally tacky set-designs yield some real flourishes (the berillium (sic?) island; the nightmarish climax).  Best of all for those who felt cheated by the 'Borges' comparisons thrown at 'Being John Malkovich', is a truly vertiginous conflation of time, narrative and identity, so that by the end, yuo're about as close to the Garden of Forking Paths as you'll ever be in Hollywood.</p></body></html>

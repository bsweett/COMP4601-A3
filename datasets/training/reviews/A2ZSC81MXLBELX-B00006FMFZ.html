<meta name="summary" content="Thought Provoking Film...Impressive DVD"></head><body><p>This review refers to the DVD Widescreen edition(20th Cent Fox/Dreamworks) of "The Road To Perdition"...<br /><br />There are so many informative and perceptive reviews here pertaining to this film and the incredible cast, and I don't want to repeat what's already been said, so basically I am going to review the DVD package itself for those who may be interested. I can hardly restrain myslef though, from saying that I loved this dark and thought provoking character study of an icy killer, who we watch slowly melting into a warm human being and caring father as the film progresses. It is one of those rare films I wanted to watch again immediatley.<br /><br />This DVD package, is what all DVD packages should be. It has everything possible available to make it a joy to view by all.<br /><br />The picture in anamorphic widescreen is always crystal clear. Considering that much of the story takes place on dark and stormy nights this is a big plus. The colors of the film, which are more muted then most films these days, really make you feel like you are back in the depression era, and are well defined on this DVD. The sound is excellent in the DD5.1. There is also an option for 2.0, or French 5.1. Every raindrop, every footstep, every rat-a-tat-tat of the tommy guns, and every word of dialouge clear and distinct. There are subtitles in English, French and Spanish, and has descriptions spoken for visually impaired as well. It may be viewed with or without commentary by directed Sam Mendes, and has the option of the commentary in Spanish and French as well(written words).<br /><br />Special features include an informative and entertaining 25 minute look at the "Making Of" documentary, with thoughts from the cast, the director, and we are fortunate enough to hear the thoughts of cinematographer Conrad Hall, who's filming was as dramatic as the story. There are several deleted scenes, which may also be viewed with commentary, and may fill in some questions about the storyline for you. Also included are cast and filmmaker bios, production notes and a photo gallery. There was also an option for the CD soundtrack, which I got all jazzed about,(I thought I could isolate Thomas Newman's magnificent score), but this turned out to be just an advertisement for the CD. The price is more then reasonable compared to what you get(or don't get) on other DVDs.<br /><br />The exquisite cast, including Tom Hanks, Paul Newman and Jude Law, will have you mesmerized. The film will leave you thinking. The DVD, impressive.<br /><br />Enjoy....Laurie</p></body></html>

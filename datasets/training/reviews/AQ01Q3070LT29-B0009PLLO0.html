<meta name="summary" content="Colin Farrell proves he can still lead a film."></head><body><p>My only reason for seeing this film is because Colin Farrell is in the lead.  I realize some people are not too keen about Farrell but he is a changed man.  He is married and a father.  Yes, he has alot of energy and vigor, but he is a tireless, versitle actor and a darn good one at that.  He is also Irish and that makes him good too.  I have seen Colin Farrell in many different roles.  He just keeps getting better.  One day, he will win the Academy Award.<br />  First of all, I can not believe Oliver Stone directed this film.  Some of his other films had those choppy, quick frames and the hand-held moving camcorder effect I do not care for.  No one likes a dramatic scene where the camera keeps moving around like an earthquake and you can't really make out anything.<br />  This story of Alexander takes place in perspective at 333 B.C., 48 years before Joel(?), after the historical accounts in the Old Testament of the Holy Bible.  Around the time Egypt was reconquered by Persians and when the Samaritan temple was built on Mount Gerizim.  Still confused?<br />  Well, just sit back and enjoy the strong performance of Colin Farrell with a cast of Jared Leto, Angelina Jolie, Anthony Hopkins, Val Kilmer, Christopher Plummer and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers.<br />  The Director's Cut includes violent scenes, sexual scenes of man/woman, male and female nudity and scenes that imply bisexuality.  I have read their were several scenes of nudity and bisexuality in the theatrical version that will not be seen in this Director's Cut DVD version due to the fact Oliver Stone cut the scenes out.<br />  ***Warning:  This particular Disc froze 1 hour and 25 minutes into the film after Colin says, "I wonder...did you ever love him?".  It froze on Angelina Jolie's reaction and skipped 9 minutes of footage.<br />  If you see black space followed by the map of Hindu Kush, your DVD has skipped 9 minutes of important scenes.  Rewind it back.<br />  Disc 2 is the Special Features.  It includes 1 hour and 26 minutes of Behind-the-Scenes of "Alexander", Tease Trailer, Theatrical trailer, "Vangelis scores Alexander" (musical score), DVD-Rom Features.<br /><br />***Update: Alexander Revisited: The Final Cut.<br />  As of February 2007, Oliver Stone has released the unrated version on DVD at 214 min (3 hrs, 34 min.). This will be the complete, longest, uncensored version.<br />  The theatrical version was only at 175 min.<br />  The Director's Cut (DVD) was only at 167 imn.<br />  The new Final Cut (DVD) runs at 214 min.<br /><br />The new DVD version "Alexander Revisted: The Final Cut" includes 39 minutes of footage never seen in the movie theatres and 47 minutes of footage not shown in the previous DVD Director's Cut version.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Awesome Film!!!"></head><body><p>This movie was very tense and suspenseful. It's literally like a roller-coaster ride. The unstoppable train almost seems like a character itself, like a fast monster. Washington and Pine star as Frank Barnes and Will Colson. Will is a rookie conductor and works with senior conductor Frank. The 777 train is being moved, but the air brakes are not hooked and it's set on the highest speed. The train yardmaster, Connie tries to figure out how to stop it, but it's going too fast and to make matters worse, the train is unmanned and carrying hazardous material. Soon, it's up to Will and Frank to stop the train before it reaches a highly populated area. I highly recommend UNSTOPPABLE!!!</p></body></html>

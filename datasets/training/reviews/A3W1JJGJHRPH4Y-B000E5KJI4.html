<meta name="summary" content="It was better than I thought it would be."></head><body><p>I had low expectations for the film, so I was very surprised I liked it as well as I did. Brad Pitt as Achilles was very good, which totally shocked me. I thought he would be miscast, but it worked. O'Toole was great. The other actors were hit and miss, but on the whole it worked. The fight scenes were very good. I read Ebert's review. I disagreed. I think 100,000 men would stop and watch Hector and Achilles fight.<br /><br />I've read the Illiad about ten years ago. The movie misses the irony of the gods and fates in the affairs of men angle, but the movie replaces that idea with the study of kingship, leadership and honor. Why do men follow a king into battle? Is there any good reason for war? Is love a good enough reason?<br /><br />The movie is overly long, overblown and too full of itself, but it works for me. The CGI creates armies of millions instead of armies of tens of thousands, but it is minor point. The sight from the upper rooms of the city of the 1000 ships arriving on shore is pretty cool. Within its genre, I think the movie holds up well.<br /><br />I had fun and that's all I ask from sandals and togas epic.</p></body></html>

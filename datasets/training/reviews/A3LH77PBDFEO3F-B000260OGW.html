<meta name="summary" content="American ideals"></head><body><p>This is a great story about good old fashioned American Ideals of right and wrong. Of course in a western there is ultimately one way to resolve differences. While the bad guy might be kind of one dimensional, Duval and Costner's characters are as good as westerns get. If you like westerns, you will be glad you watched this movie.</p></body></html>

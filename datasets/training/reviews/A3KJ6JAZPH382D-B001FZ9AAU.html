<meta name="summary" content="He is Iron Man"></head><body><p>With each decade, the dark heart of Comic Book Adaptations beats a little faster. Ever since Tim Burton made his version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5XOY8">Batman</a>, super-heroes have made our nights in the theater all the more exciting and thought provoking. Now, with Marvel Comics' taking the studio reigns on "Iron Man," they've done something totally new. "Iron Man" is the rare comic book movie that stands apart from its origins, a movie that could have been made without a back-mythology, and a film you can go see without previously knowing anything about the source material.<br /><br />A great deal of this has to do with the casting. Robert Downey Jr, as billionaire Tony Stark, brings enough snarky humor to his conflicted billionaire playboy genius that you totally fall for the act. As his rival Obadiah Stane, Jeff Bridges obviously relishes getting to play baddie. He's all oily charm and malevolence, and watching is descent into the Iron Monger is a marvel (pun intended). Speaking of Iron Monger, the suits, oh the suits. When Tony Stark perfects the second Iron Man outfit (with the help of his AI companions), it really will make you believe he can fly. Even with the CGI, the suits look realistic and hot.<br /><br />The suits do battle and it's better than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VR0570">Transformers</a> fights (which were both done by the same company). The other "training exercise" shots, like the one with the fighter planes, are pulse-racing fun. The gadgets are worthy of a Bond Film, and the humor that slides in helps give the movie balance. (Like Stark's commentary to his robots during suit tests, for example.)<br /><br />Balance is also achieved by the rest of the cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow as the loyal Pepper Potts and Leslie Bibb as reporter Christine Everhart. Terrence Howard (who is underused) plays Stark's best friend Jim Rhoades. Stan Lee makes the obligatory cameo, and the assorted bad guys are, well, the current middle eastern terrorists du-jour. (It is worth noting that the ultimate evil-doer here is not a foreigner...)<br /><br />All in all, a great Good Vs Evil night at the movies, down to the Black Sabbath finally popping up in the credits. And was it me, or did the end credits pay homage to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005OCMR">Tron</a>, a movie Jeff Brides just happen to be in?  I also have to - as everyone else here has stated - remind everyone: stay through the credits. "Iron Man" kicks the summer blockbuster season off with a bang.</p></body></html>

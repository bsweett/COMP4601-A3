Don't get me wrong; both have turned in solid performances in other projects, but their talents generally seemed underutilized, perhaps because their films are not always top drawer.  Take the scene in "Sideways" where the uncertain Giamatti chickens out of being seduced by the lovely Madsen -- had their performances not been so impeccable, and had the writing not been so dead on, I might not enjoy the film as much as I do.  As it stands, "Sideways" is more a collection of scenes, some good, some great, than a movie, but that doesn't stop it from shining in many moments, including a would-be golf course rumble and the gutbuster where the usually annoying Sandra Oh gets to kick the daylights out of the usually annoying Thomas Haden Church.  And while I could have done without having to see the latter's backside while enjoying the carnal pleasures of the former, I do admire the willingness of the actors to go with the moment in their performances.  "Sideways" suffers from the usual Hollywood overhype -- it's a charming film but not a particularly revelatory or remarkable one -- but adult audiences in middle age or creeping toward it will likely crack a smile and shed a well deserved tear despite themselves.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This movie has everything!"></head><body><p>Absolutely everything!<br /><br />-- Better fights scenes than The Matrix<br /><br />-- Better attitude than Men in Black<br /><br />-- Better chase scenes than Roadrunner and Coyote<br /><br />-- Better dialog than the Three Stooges<br /><br />-- Better sets than The Honeymooners<br /><br />The "Axe" gang moves into town, a bad-axe bunch with lines like "I'm the bad guy!" They attack the old order, en masse, with hatchets, tommy guns, tuxedos, and top hats. Once they control everything worth having, they move into the poor section, called the Pig Sty. People here make humble livings when they can, as a noodle chef, coolie, or foppish tailor raising the hem just a bit for Bucktooth Jane's attempts at selling herself (or offering short-term rentals).<br /><br />They picked the wrong chef, laborer and - in their words - fairy. These men (more or less men, anyway) have mastered mysterious martial arts, and promptly kick the goobers out of a half-hundred or so bad guys. The first round of heroes falls, but more and stronger take their places. Watch The Landlady - watch her landing, especially, after she evades a truck in that road chase. Then watch her loud Capri pants in the penultimate fight against The Beast. The ultimate battle comes after that, but I'll leave it for you to discover.<br /><br />I can't think when I last laughed that hard at a movie. It's a self-concious send-up of so many stereotypes I lost count of them all. Heck, I probably didn't even know what half of them were, in the Chinese idiom, but the satire was broad enough to enjoy anyway.<br /><br />This is insanely funny. Just take it as it comes, and try not to hurt yourself laughing.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A commendable effort to raise awareness of a dirty aspect of the diamond trade"></head><body><p>"Blood Diamond" highlights an important issue - diamonds being used to fund civil wars in this case the civil war in Sierra Leone in the late 1990's.<br /><br />The viewer is introduced to these issues via three characters - a South African diamond smuggler played by Leonardo di Caprio, an American journalist played by Jennifer Connelly, and a local whose family is torn apart.<br /><br />Sadly Leonardo is miscast in the "he-man" role - he's just too nice - although his attempt at a South African accent is pretty good. Connelly is also somewhat lightweight as the journalist although she it not helped by dialogue that largely leaves her spouting polemics. The villians are merely cardboard cutouts.<br /><br />The plot is all-too-contrived and cliched and builds to a predictable conclusion.<br /><br />The film-makers are to be commended for bringing an important issue to a mainstream film, however, they are all-too-obvious in making their point leaving the viewer feeling preached to rather than moved.</p></body></html>

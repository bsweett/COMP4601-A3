There are quite a number of wonderful scenes in "Big Fish," but stringing them together into a whole is a problem.  Albert Finney as Edward Bloom is miscast.  He doesn't seem to get a grasp on the character (very unusual for Finney), or at least doesn't harmonize him with the earlier version of Bloom - as played (wonderfully) by Ewan McGregor.  And without that key element, the movie doesn't have a heart - or least only half a heart. Still, this is an ambitious movie, and two stars seems low, but it's this very ambition that I think sinks the film.  It's crowded to the point of not leaving much of an impression.  (And it has more "guest" appearances than "The Greatest Story Ever Told."  If there's an actor you've missed seeing lately, check out "Big Fish.")  The movie runs in a million seemingly picaresque directions at once, ultimately leading me nowhere. I did feel the ending to be very well done, but by that time I'd lost most of my interest. My son's condemnation - every 10 minutes or so, seemed appropriate: "This is boring."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Chronicles of Riddick"></head><body><p>So, now we're introduced to the epic world of Riddick's universe (underverse).  I think it's a little strange now that the titles of the three movies in order go like this:  The Chronicles of Riddick:  Pitch Black, The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury, and The Chronicles of Riddick.  Anyway, I feel that Keith David's talent and character were completely wasted in this film.  It just seems like something Paul Anderson would do (not giving anything away).  Another thing is the fact that this universe is SOOOO different from the more dirty/realistic atmosphere of the first movie, and even Dark Fury really can't explain this.  Another thing is that there's no talk of superhuman armies taking over galaxies in Pitch Black, you'd think something like that would be big news but it just sort of jumps out at us in this film.  It just feels a little too epic compared to the first movie.  Anyway, the action and special effects completely make up for this.  One thing I don't understand is why Universal releases 2 seperate versions of the films.  Theatrical and Director's Cut.  That's really dumb IMO.  Well, when the 3rd Riddick movie comes out there'll be a box set, and that's when I'll get the DVD's.</p></body></html>

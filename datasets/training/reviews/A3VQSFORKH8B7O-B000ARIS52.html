<meta name="summary" content="GREAT VISUALS, WEAK PLOTTING, GOOD PERFORMANCES!"></head><body><p>The film adaptation of Frank Miller's "Sin City" graphic novel is one of the strangest film experiences ever. The visual style is unique, probably one of the first films whose images are similar to those in the books.<br /><br />However, the plotting is weak. The four stories that encompass the movie are too short, and when one ends, we immeadiately jump into another one. For a normal film-goer, this could make it a confusing movie.<br /><br />Another draw-back is that the film is just too graphic. Some of the violent images are needless, and seriously detract from the film.<br /><br />The acting is good, though. Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson, Jamie King and Jessica Alba give some of their best performances to date.<br /><br />Overall, this is a strange-but-good film that will mostly appeal to fans of the comic book.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: B</p></body></html>

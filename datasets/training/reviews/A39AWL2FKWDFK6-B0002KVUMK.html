<meta name="summary" content="Trashy monster flick"></head><body><p>The multi talented Hugh Jackman in an obvious money grab plays the title role in the predominantly awful flick "Van Helsing".  A monster vanquisher commisssioned by the Vatican, he is assigned to rid the Romanian countryside of Count Dracula and his 3 brides in 1888.  He is also endeavoring to save the surviving members of the Valerious family, sworn enemies of the vampirish count.<br /><br />Jackman, laughingly garbed in contemporary clothing is accompanied by sidekick Carl played by David Wenham.  Carl is to Van Helsing what Q is to James Bond, supplying him with an array of high tech weaponry.  Dracula played by Aussie Richard Roxburgh, better known as the Duke in Moulin Rouge, has every monster ever created at his disposal with the exception of the Invisible Man.<br /><br />While the special effects are pretty good, the movie is unfortunately a juvenile piece of garbage.  The highlight of the film is the alluring Kate Beckinsale, playing Anna Valerious, whose raven haired beauty lights up the screen and even managed to sustain her Transylvanian accent.</p></body></html>

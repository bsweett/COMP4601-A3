The film opens on a space station that is experimenting with chimps as pilots in some deep space probing.  One chimp is sent into one of those ominous clouds we always saw on "Star Trek".  When he loses communication, our hero, Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) disobeys the commanding officer and flies out after him.  Yeah right.  The writers couldn't even keep the original name of the main character.  Leo is somehow better?  Anyway, once Leo inevitably crashes on an unknown planet, he is immediately caught up in a mob scene where humans are being rounded up by apes on horses.  These humans don't do much to resist or contribute to the movie for that matter.  Estella Warren plays a honey-haired Daena who has eyes for Leo but based on their lack of chemistry, I suspect it's just procreation on her mind.  Leo does strike up a bond with a couple of the more liberal apes.  Primarily Ari, nicely played by Helena Bonham Carter in spite of monkey make-up that makes her look like Paula Abdul.  Ari also has eyes for Leo and my guess is that Wahlberg's character is supposed to reciprocate.  Unfortunately while Carter delivers a convincing performance, Wahlberg is a cold fish throughout.  Too bad, I liked the angle.  This middle section has a goodly amount of action, chills and thrills which leads to a less than satisfactory conclusion.  Most notable in this remake, is the performance of Tim Roth as bad-ass ape, General Thade.  He is a take-no-prisoner kind of military man.  Roth's mimicking and expressions are first rate.  It's enough to make the movie watchable.  The end comes of course and it is here the bad taste in your mouth will linger.  Unlike the brilliant ending provided for in the original, this one is just plain stupid.</p></body></html>

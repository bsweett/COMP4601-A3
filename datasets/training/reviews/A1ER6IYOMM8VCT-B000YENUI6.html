<meta name="summary" content="GREAT CAST & PERFORMANCES, BUT SERIOUSLY FLAWED!"></head><body><p>This film while having a good story and cast is really hard to follow. The thick accent and mumbling of characters had me straining and backing my TiVo up too many times! I also felt that some scenes were excruciatingly long and slow! I almost wanted to fast forward, which is never a good sign. This has got to be one of Cronenberg's worst films! Some viewers may like it more than I did, I will never sit through this a second time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good performances, but disappointing story"></head><body><p>Whenever a movie receives an avalanche of critical support, I get a little hesitant about seeing that film.  What typically happens is towards the latter third of the year, movie studios will release their films that they feel are most likely to receive Oscar nominations.  The problem that occurs is that many of these movies generate tremendous advanced word and end being the benefactors of the mob mentality among films critics.  If a few notable critics give `Year's 10 Best' acclaim to these award-season films, the majority of other critics will feel pressured to make themselves believe the movie is just as great.  Unfortunately, many times, these films prove to be just `ok' at best, and frequently they may actually be quite bad.  In past years, films that received an astounding amount of critical acclaim, but were inappropriate, unsatisfying, or downright clunkers include "The Sweet Hereafter", "I Am Sam", and the Laura Linney debacle "You Can Count on Me".<br /><br />The latest offering by director (not actor) Clint Eastwood, "Mystic River" falls firmly into that category of the over-praised year-end films.  The reputation of the director, not to mention a grade-A cast that includes Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Laurence Fishburne, Kevin Bacon, Laura Linney, and Marcia Gay Harden gives this film a pedigree that few films have ever had.  The previews make "Mystic River" look like a truly powerful and moving film.  However, there's a danger with movies whose sole source of power is the impact they are able to have on your emotions, as is the case here.  The danger is that, when in the course of being emotionally gripped (or manipulated, depending on your point of view), the audience reacts very poorly to any plot developments that confuse, distract, or disturb them.  Disturbing, inappropriate, and unnecessary subplots destroyed whatever affect "The Sweet Hereafter" was aiming for.  In "Mystic River" some confusing developments nearly derail this film, as well.<br /><br />The story, itself, focuses on the lives of three friends from Boston.  As children, they were inseparable, until one day when a despicable cop and priest deceive, kidnap, and molest one of the boys.  The boy, named Dave, escapes, but his life and the friendship of all three of them is changed irrevocably.  Fast forward 25 years and the three friends have long since gone their separate ways.  Dave (played by Tim Robbins) is still shattered by what happened to him as a child, but is trying to have some semblance of a normal life with a wife and a young son of his own.  One of the two other friends, Sean (Kevin Bacon), is now a Boston homicide cop whose estranged wife has an annoying habit of always calling him, but never saying anything.  The other friend, Jimmy (Sean Penn), is an ex-con who controls something that resembles his neighborhood's underworld, though he is trying his best to stay as legitimate as possible for the benefit of his children (one is an older daughter from a previous marriage and two are young girls from his current marriage).  There lives end up intersecting again on a terrible day in which Jimmy's oldest is found murdered after a night of partying.  Sean is one of the cops assigned to investigate the case and Dave's wife is the cousin of Jimmy's wife and tries to be supportive in their time of need.  Questionable motives first lead to a number of suspects before Dave's bizarre behavior begins to draw the focus squarely on him.<br /><br />What makes this movie work, and why I won't give it a negative recommendation, is the powerhouse performances a few of the actors.  In this respect, the critics are correct in heaping praise on this movie.  Sean Penn's devastation as the grieving (and aggrieved) father is heart wrenching.  It is top-notch performance.  Yet, even it pales in comparison to the sorrowful and agonizing performance given by Tim Robbins as Dave.  Robbins, who is normally viewed as a better director than an actor, hits all the right notes in his embodiment of Dave.  In Robbins portrayal, you can empathize and almost sympathize with emotions and distress that are an everyday part of Dave's life.  He's a man who hasn't felt like he will ever be human again or ever be an accepted member of society, no matter how hard he tries.  These performances are what make this film go.<br /><br />On the downside, there are uninspiring performances by Kevin Bacon and Laura Linney (who plays Jimmy's wife), and a bizarrely neurotic one by Marcia Gay Harden as Dave's unsympathetic wife.  In addition, "Mystic River" includes that `confusing' moment that leaves you scratching your head and saying, "what just happened here?"  Without revealing any crucial plot details, it can be said that at the end of the movie, there is a scene where Jimmy is confessing to his wife about the actions he has taken and his wife gives a bizarre and confusing monologue where she seems as though she could be a related to Lady MacBeth.  Even though the climax of the movie was a bit unsatisfying, it was arrived at honestly.  The inclusion of this odd denouement can't do anything but make the viewer feel unnaturally uncomfortable with everything that took place in this film.  Now, it is fact that this last scene is present in the book "Mystic River", but it left readers very uncomfortable there, too.  Under the guise of `artistic license', Clint Eastwood would have been well served by excluding that scene.<br /><br />On the whole, "Mystic River" is not a bad movie, and I give it three stars (though just barely).  The points made above demonstrate why this film is not worthy of ridiculous praise it is receiving, but on its own merits is still a credible film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Closer To Limited Film making"></head><body><p>I am a Natalie Portman fan and I don't even know why. No,I don't think she's a great actress but there's something about her screen presence and otherwise that makes me want to commit into watching all movies involving her.My favourite scene in Star Wars III was one involving her in a lowkey mood.Getting back to my review,<br /><br />Closer is a movie I expected a lot from.With an awkward star cast comprising of Jude Law,Julia Roberts,NP and Mr.Ugly Arthur I wondered where all this could end.The movie starts in an usual bemusing way that leads me into beleiving it's a dreamy film. There are certain chain of events and the director of the movie relies on the viewer's prudence to make a story of it's own.What I liked about the movie was the photographing session lasting 5-10 mins between Roberts and Law.The UK Chat session was pretty interesting too.Mind you,that's about it.<br /><br />Maybe it was the starcast and how they were played together or maybe it was the weak script.Or maybe it was both.I admire films for their spark of entertainment. Closer bored me with it's bitterness it never gets out of.<br /><br />PS - I am not in a relationship as of now. I found the plot and some of the extensions extremely boring. I would recommend this to someone who's as hard to win as me and "must see a film he/she wants to see"</p></body></html>

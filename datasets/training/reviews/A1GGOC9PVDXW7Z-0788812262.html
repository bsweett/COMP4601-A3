The colors on my VHS copy are vivid and the film's condition quite excellent throughout.<br /><br />Random impressions:<br />Seeing Julie Andrews so young and beautiful, and Dick Van Dyke without all the shaggy white hair, and Ed Wynn alive and giddy, was an absolute delight!<br /><br />There are SO many songs in this picture! It's practically an operetta.<br />The live action/animation sequences are quite clever.<br />That choreographed chimney sweep number is magnificent!<br />Dick Van Dyke is a helluva dancer, and Julie Andrews keeps right up with him.<br /><br />It's not mentioned in the closing credits that Van Dyke has a dual role: as Mary's friend Bert and Mr. Dawes, the elderly chairman of the bank board.<br /><br />Finally, an invitation to some shared speculation---<br /><br />What exactly IS Mary Poppins? Is she a witch or a spirit made carnate?<br />We initially meet her as she sits on a cloud, powdering her nose. Later, to better see her face she wants a larger wall mirror, then appears within it to sing a duet with and even outdo herself. A third looking glass moment occurs in the chimney sweep sequence-- Mary uses a compact to touch up her dirty face with more soot!<br /><br />Clearly, the young lady is vain. She "hmmph"s when her mirror image outsings her, so she's also jealous, and when she refuses to answer her employer's questions, it shows Mary to be headstrong.<br /><br />So, IS Miss Poppins "practically perfect"? Do all these less-than-ideal personality traits indicate she's human, after all? What do you think? Hit COMMENT below if you'd like to participate! Meanwhile DO enjoy Walt Disney's classic family film. MARY POPPINS.

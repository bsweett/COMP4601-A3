There's only a slim chance of stopping it, so what does the American military industrial complex do?  Gather all of the world's best scientists and put them in a helicopter hovering right next to the predicted site of impact, so they can cross their fingers and pray, hoping for the object to slow down.<br /><br />The opening scene of this silly science fiction affair -- where Keanu Reeves in an apparently fake beard with clear skin and no signs of having weathered anything wanders through an obviously fake Antarctic blizzard -- made it clear that this wouldn't best the original through convincing realism or special effects.  This impression was confirmed later as a poorly animated CGI snake wiggled (it couldn't manage a slither) its way towards a shining globe.<br /><br />The story didn't fare any better as American military bluster and incompetence (channeled by the odd choice of Kathy Bates as a paranoid US secretary of defense) met with vague and unemotional incomprehension and disappointment on the part of Reeves as Klaatu.  The screenplay includes some pretty bizarre elements, that could almost pass for surreal if the film didn't seem to want to be taken so seriously.<br /><br />Some have complained about the acting - but as far as I can tell the actors did the best they could with a plodding and silly script.  Keanu Reeves was doing a slightly more wooden version of the wooden actor he plays in almost everything he's ever been in apart from his finer moments (in, of course, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005PJ6N">Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0AQ">The Matrix</a>) - but that's what the script called for.  Jennifer Connolly did the best you can do with horribly written part - the beautiful astrobiologist who is also a struggling single mother to a stepson played by Will Smith's kid.  Will Smith's kid, Jaden, did as well as he could with an enormously overwritten and unnecessary role for which it's pretty clear his dad called in a favor with the producer.  The kid's got a decent screen presence but only a modest emotional range - he doesn't yet have anything like the acting chops of other young screen stars like Dakota Fanning.  (So why, on the brink of global disaster and with the clock ticking did the main characters have to spend several important minutes working through this kid's emotional rollercoaster hangups?  Why were the ostensibly tender reconciliatory moments between a woman and her stepson, that were supposed to convince Klaatu that humanity was worth saving, written so full of cliches and so completely unmoving?)<br /><br />The CGI work was only a notch up from the really bad B-movies that are increasingly showing up on cable.  For a hint at how to do this kind of disaster movie right check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCUO02">Knowing</a>.  It had a lot of goofy elements thrown in there as well, and was downright silly in a number of spots, but the atmosphere was creepy, the script was, well, much smarter than this one, and in spite of everything it was a lot of fun to watch, and not quite so heavyhanded with its message.  I'm sorry, but this one was just painful and boring.  Do yourself a favor and rent the much more enjoyable original film instead.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This DVD Is So Good It Gives Me ... VERTIGO"></head><body><p>Now this is how DVDs should be made!  Universal has done an excellent job with this Hitchcock classic.  <p>First of all, as far as audio commentary goes, more DVDs should take their cue from this one.  VERTIGO features at  least 3 different voices and points of view as narrators.  You do not have  to listen to the same person for two hours.  Granted, some audio  commentators are very entertaining (see/hear Terry Gilliam's commentary on  BRAZIL or 12 MONKEYS).  Some are not.  Plus, it's more bang for your buck  listening to VERTIGO's film restorers and original associate producer.  Another disc that handles the commentary issue well is CONTACT.  <p>Back to  VERTIGO:  The other bonus stuff is great.  We get to see original and  re-release trailers; lots of great production photos; and the &quot;Foreign  Ending&quot;, which is very interesting.  <p>The documentary about  restoring VERTIGO (which was originally on cable's A&amp;E channel) is  fascinating and well done.  I find the restoration process very  interesting. The picture and sound on the DVD are exquisite.  It's never  looked better!<p>VERTIGO, the film, is a classic.  I agree with some of my  fellow reviewers that the story's structure is a bit odd -- Hitch reveals  the &quot;secret&quot; half way through the movie.  However, VERTIGO is a  film about obsession.  It doesn't matter who Madeleine really is.  Scottie  is in the throws of his own personal vertigo and that is far more  interesting to watch than a gimmicky who-done-it.<p>This DVD is definitely  for the collection!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A BRILLIANT AND VERY CLEVER HORROR/THRILLER  9.5 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>I had heard a great deal of positive response on this film, but hadn't got around to watching it until recently. I expected it to be good, but I never expected anything this good. The writing is razor-sharp and the film is completely unpredictable which made it so fiendishly good and enormously entertaining.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: A fourteen-year-old girl named Haley meets a thirty-two-year-old guy named Jeff over the internet and they decide to meet at a restaurant and then decide to go back to his place. He shows her around his home and decides to give her some drinks as well. But Haley turns the tables on Jeff and she drugs him and holds him captive in his own home where she constantly interrogates him and asks him the whereabouts a missing woman whose picture he just so happens to have and what he did the teenage girls he took pictures of. No matter what Jeff does, she always outsmarts him and mocks him in the process.<br />MUSIC: The music for the most part is actually pretty good, and it fit the mood of this psychotic and brilliant horror/thriller very well.<br />ACTING: I really got to hand it to Ellen Page's performance (She was the actress who played Juno), she easily gives the best performance. She was smart, witty with dark humor, and she played the role a psychopath flawlessly. Patrick Wilson (He played Nite Owl in Watchmen) also puts on a great show as a demented pedaphile who is terrified of this girl. For the most part, I can see no flaws in their performances.<br />ACTION: This film is mostly dialogue only. There is very little in terms of violence and almost no blood. I really have to hand it to the writer of this film because the dialogue is sharp and clever and this film was almost never boring (Though there were a few moments in which it was a tad boring). The characters always had something to talk about and keep you on edge the entire time. This film feels very fresh and is completely unpredictable and waiting for what's around the next corner is always exciting.<br />OVERALL: Tired of the usual cliched horror films or thrillers? Hard Candy is the perfect choice for you. This film is a superbly crafted piece that always leaves you on edge and always makes you guess what comes next. You can't say that about other films in this day and age.<br />THE GOOD: Sharply written story and dialogue, good music, and flawless acting.<br />THE BAD: Some moments were a tad boring.</p></body></html>

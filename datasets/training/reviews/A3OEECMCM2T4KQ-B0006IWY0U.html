One can think of other well-made classic maritime films such as Mutiny on the Bounty with Marlon Brando, and my other favourite, Horatio Hornblower, starring Gregory Peck. These films will always be classics, as they have withstood the test of time, as Master and Commander will most certainly do in the future.<br /><br /> This high praise comes from the obvious, as this film is almost flawless in many respects, artistically, technically and its historical realism. However this unqualified praise really comes from the fact that my expectations before finally viewing the film were actually quite low. In fact, up until a few months ago, I had totally overlooked that Peter Weir was the film's director, and this man has proven himself to be one of the current greats in Hollywood. His past triumphs, such as Witness, staring Harrison Ford, in my opinion, was one of the top ten films made in the eighties. Considering my expectations were nothing to speak of, Master and Commander turned out to be a great surprise.<br /><br /> For the most part this film is a story about leadership, courage, tenacity, friendship, honour and loyalty. And this is all done in the film without having to resort to unnecessary sentimentalism or platitudes. Captain Jack Aubrey is the manifestation or epitome of all these virtues and more. What an inspiring character. Russell Crowe delivered a believable performance as &quot;Lucky Jack&quot;. Crowe has a tremendous amount of presence in front of the camera, which is the exact skill or gift necessary to play this particular character. If anything, most if not all the performances in this film were first rate.<br /><br /> The soundtrack, too, was appropriate for the film. As a classical music admirer and listener, for once I've been prompted to purchase the recording (which doesn't happen often) as well as the DVD to add to the library. Master and Commander is an &quot;all-rounder&quot; and will be a pleasure to watch many times over. A solid five stars.</p></body></html>

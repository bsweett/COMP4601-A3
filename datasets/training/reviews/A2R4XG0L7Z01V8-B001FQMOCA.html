<meta name="summary" content="Johnny Who?"></head><body><p>Prior to watching this, I'd never heard of Johnny Cash. Apart from the fact he'd died, and someone on American Idol had sang "Walk The Line", which I absolutely loved the lyrics to. For some reason, I just had to get this film. My dad asked me why, my mum asked me why, my boyfriend asked me why, and I had no really good answer to give them. I just wanted to see it.<br /><br />I have no real interest in Joaquin Phoenix either. He irritates me. Yes, I like Reese Witherspoon, but the film isn't about her. But apparently, he's really well suited to the role (you forget it's actually him soon enough, even that annoying scar which looks like a cleft palate), and has an alright voice.<br /><br />Both of the actors did their own vocals, taking six months vocal training to learn and be Johnny & June Cash. I had to actually put the subtitles on for Reese Witherspoon though, with a strong southern accent, I could not understand a word the girl was saying! The songs were could, toe tapping but forgettable - apart from "Walk The Line".<br /><br />My one quibble about Walk The Line, is the fact huge chunks of time were deemed not important enough to be included in the film, making the film seem almost jumpy. There is some stuff I would have dumped in order to see more of his early life, and most importantly, life after him & June finally got married & got together. After getting married, they were together 35 years, why not show some more of that?<br /><br />I have to applaud Reese, she did hold her own in the film, a role that could have been reduced to a few lines, a song, and more a redneck hick role.<br /><br />Elvis also appears in this, and although he's not in it for long, he really irritated me, as they could have chosen a better Elvis lookalike from all the thousands that there are out there! I have never seen a guy look less like Elvis ever.<br /><br />It does get slightly boring in parts, as I've said before, there are big jumps in time, and you feel like there's something in there that could have been shown, and the ending was a bit of a let down. But the film holds well, as do Reese & Joaquin's voices, but I'm still at a loss to why he was so popular.<br /><br />I keep a close watch on this heart of mine<br /><br />I keep my eyes wide open all the time<br /><br />I keep the ends out for the tie that binds<br /><br />Because you're mine, I walk the line<br /><br />I find it very, very easy to be true<br /><br />I find myself alone when each day is through<br /><br />Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you<br /><br />Because you're mine, I walk the line<br /><br />As sure as night is dark and day is light<br /><br />I keep you on my mind both day and night<br /><br />And happiness I've known proves that it's right<br /><br />Because you're mine, I walk the line<br /><br />You've got a way to keep me on your side<br /><br />You give me cause for love that I can't hide<br /><br />For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide<br /><br />Because you're mine, I walk the line</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="James BOMBED..."></head><body><p>Wow. This was cinematic vomit for sure. I saw Quantum of Solace earlier tonight and it was kickarse. Since this was on TV I decided to watch it since there was nothing else... and boy, this movie SUCKED!!!!!! Worst 007 movie ever. There's so many bad things about the movie I'm not even kidding. Such as:<br /><br />- The Gunbarrel opening scene- stupid bullet and the calypso version of the theme...<br /><br />- That god-awful Madonna song... Techno and Bond do NOT mix!<br /><br />- Halle Barry. Wasted actress. She was AWFUL as a Bond girl. Sure she was hot, but she was AWFUL.<br /><br />- CG CG everywhere... I'm not lying, this is the most godawful CG-laden film I've ever seen. The plane??? The scorpions??? That car???<br /><br />- The stupid vanishing car.<br /><br />- LAME WRITING. I don't think I've ever met someone named "Mr. Kil"<br /><br />- The lair looked like a disco with lasers everywhere<br /><br />- As if Madonna's theme wasn't bad enough, her totally pointless cameo. Not only did she suck, but did Tom Jones or Shirley Bassey get a cameo???<br /><br />There's more I can name, but there's WAY too many...</p></body></html>

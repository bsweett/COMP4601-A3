<meta name="summary" content="Redefining the word "Might""></head><body><p>With this movie came a deilverance of a reality check.Men have for ages been warriors and it lies within our system to have a desire for rage and physical superiority."Troy" made me realise a lot of things.Its gigantic in its scope and absolute devotion to the theme it wishes to potray to the audience.<br /><br />A very interesting thing I noticed about most of the characters of the film was not the good acting and devotion to their role but the fact that their eyes spoke what their character demanded.Upon carefully analysing not for a second did I feel Im watching a movie. Its not at all exaggerated despite the countless number of characters with very well defined attributes. Brad Pitt was larger than life in this film.<br /><br />Its impossible to have favourites in Troy but the one character in this film that left me spellbound with his integrity and isolation of soul was "Hector"(Eric Bana) There were certain scenes with him in the film that bought out the Trojan in me.<br /><br />It'll be an absolute waste of time trying to figure out what I disliked about the film because I was completely spellbound and awestruck by the dialogues. I've lost count on the number of times a dialogue made me feel absolutely awakened and insignificant.<br /><br />The one dialogue I do waguely remember was the scene in which the little kid,messenger,demands Achillies presence at the war grounds. The kid says "I wouldn't fight a man as big as him." And Pitt(Achillies) replies " ..thats why your name will not be remembered" Now I dont know what that did to the audience and how the audience in the theater reacted to it but it awoke a certain rage in me. I stood up and cheered for some reason beyond me.Always felt the insignificant need provocation and if this film doesnt certify everything I stand for and re-enforce all of its endless number of salutes it demands then nothing ever will.<br /><br />I know I am noone to judge something as mangamous as this but in my most honest opinion this film killed doubts in the line of thought imbred in me. A lot of dialogues and scenes in the film cannot be forgotten. I demand of everyone reading to go watch this film. Either rent the DVD or buy it but please watch it for your own good.I borrowed a friend's DVD . I can't wait to give it a second watch cause its an education in itself. This movie deserves being purchased and I shall do so ASAP. Quiet possibly the most brilliant historical re-capturing.<br /><br />With Much Muted Respect and 36 Salutes.</p></body></html>

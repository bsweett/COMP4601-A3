<meta name="summary" content="Perhaps John Ford's Best Western"></head><body><p>THE SEARCHERS is perhaps John Ford's best Western and perhaps his best film. John Wayne's obsessive Ethan Edwards is one of his best roles. John Wayne is Ethan Edwards playing the character and embellishing him with just enough Wayne-isms to set this returning ex-Confederate apart from the rest of the community. Wayne's Ethan Edwards is characterized by an intense sense of stoicism and strong individuality required of this enigmatic and complex man. Upon his return from the war the Comanches destroy what family he has and it is unclear if Wayne is acting out his hatred of the Indians or simply avenging his loss as he begins his quest to rescue his niece, Debbie. Wayne is accompanied by his half breed nephew Martin, portrayed by effectively by Jeffrey Hunter, on his quest which continually reveals Wayne's contempt for the Indians. The quest and anticipation of what Wayne will do when and if they find Debbie is an emotional journey for the characters and viewer.</p></body></html>

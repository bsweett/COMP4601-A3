<meta name="summary" content="Think of this as Rob Zombie's "Murder Ride" more than a coherent splatter flick"></head><body><p>How much you like (or detest) "House of 1,000 Corpses" depends entirely on the perspective you take towards Rob Zombie's first film as a director.  As soon as you put in the DVD and ring the bell, you are confronted by the deranged clown figure of Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig), who immediately gets in your face and threatens you if you do not make a selection.  After he goes through his rant you begin the movie and are deposited at Captain Spaulding's Gas Station and in a brief prologue it is made clear to us that this is a dangerous place.  Then we revisit the place, this time in the company of the next set of victims.  Bill Hudley (Rainn Wilson) and Jerry Goldsmith (Chris Hardwick) are traveling the back roads of America cataloguing tourist traps and have dragged along their girl friends Denise Willis (Erin Daniels) and Mary Knowles (Jennifer Jostyn).  Captain Spaulding has a "Murder Ride" and since this is exactly the sort of shtick the boys are interested in, they take it (Spaulding's lumbering assistant pushes the car through the fun house).<br /><br />One of the displays is about Dr. Satan, a mad scientist who was doing diabolical experiments on mental patients at an insane asylum until he was lynched by the locals.  The boys want to check out the tree where this happened and Captain Spaulding draws them a map.  On the way they pick up a hitchhiker named Baby (Sheri Moon) and get a flat tire, so there are so many nails in these kids coffins it is not even funny.  Of course at this point they begin to go on the film's real "Murder Ride."  That metaphor is important because the idea of a ride through what was once ironically called a "fun house" better fits "House of 1,000 Corpses" than does any attempt to think in terms of a coherent narrative structure.  Then again, your basic horror film is usually reducible to the idea that you put innocents in peril and then see if they can get out alive, which is what we have here.<br /><br />But if you think of it as a "Murder Ride" then it all makes much more sense, because just like going through a Fun House you have to look quick to see what there is to see and it all goes by so quickly, both the good and the bad.  More importantly, there is a lot to see here because Zombie has apparently taken the approach of throwing in everything he could possibly think of into this film including as many kitchen sinks as possible.  I would think that most people would watch this movie and find several things that will particularly creep them out, and for all the blood and gore Zombie does not linger on them too long, even when he is not presenting things in the mode of a music video more than as a theatrical film.  Captain Spaulding could have sustained an entire horror film, as could Otis Driftwood (Bill Moseley), and the same can be said for Dr. Satan as the local serial killer legend.  However, early on it becomes clear everything in this film is going to be related (naming most of the characters for roles played by Groucho in Marx Bros. movies is a give away), which is why the final twist never had the ghost of a chance of working.  But then the title blatantly tells you want we were are going to see sooner or later in this movie.<br /><br />That fact that these events take place in the 1970s is significant because that, of course, is when the original version of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' came out.  This is not only because Rob Zombie's sensibilities, for lack of a better word, are more in tune with the splatter flicks of that era than with the current generation of slick horror films following the lead of "Scream," but also because it is easier to believe, again for lack of a better word, that all this stuff could be happening somewhere in Texas back then.  Besides, I think in following the lead of Tobe Hooper's classic splatter flick that "House of 1,000 Corpses" improves on the weakest part of the original, which is when Leatherface's family sits down for dinner.  At that point they became more weird than frightening and the film is all down hill from there.  With this one meeting the entire family just means the fun, for lack of yet another word, is just beginning.<br /><br />Although I was tempted to round down on this one because the final scene constituted a lame exclamation mark to the film, I had to admit there were enough things in the film to creep my out so that I had to watch an episode of "Gilmore Girls" to cleanse my palate (Emily Gilmore is not as freaky as Captain Spaulding), which warrants at least a four star rating.  I gave up on having all the pieces make sense because clearly it was not that kind of a film, but it you demand logical coherence than this one will drive you crazy and your rating down.  But taken at face value as a cinematic fun house Zombie's film provides enough unsettling moments to justify going along for the "Murder Ride."</p></body></html>

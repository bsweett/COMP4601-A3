<meta name="summary" content="Escape from the Toy Box!  Fun Pixar Film."></head><body><p>I finished watching Toy Story 3 and although I still have not seen the first two Toy Story films, I felt that the action and lessons learned were powerfully portrayed, but missing the adult themes and nostalgia that I enjoyed with Wall-E and Up.<br /><br />The film starts out with a short, "Day & Night" which I thought was fun.  Both Day and Night have their pros and cons which we see.  Ah the nightlife of Vegas!  Ah, the beach girls in summer!<br /><br />Many years ago, most films had a cartoon and a newsreel before starting the main picture.  In fact, there were these things called "double features" which you don't see too much of, which had two films playing for a single admission price.  Good old days.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the main event:  Andy's toys are being boxed up and he's on his way to college.  Through an accident, most of Andy's toys almost get trashed (to a toy, being trashed is the same as hell!).  Thanks to some of Woody's (cowboy toy) actions they escape only to end up in Sunnydale, a preschool that has the apparency of lots of kids playing with toys, to being beaten up and busted apart by little children!<br /><br />The toys are not happy with being treated like hammers and paint brushes and want to be played with.  Too bad says "Lotso", a large, toy bear who is literally a dictator running the toy show at the preschool.<br /><br />I came away from the movie with the idea that there are several ways to handle rejection.  Some of the toys, like Lotso, handled rejection by becoming bitter and treating others badly.  He came up with the false idea that "everyone" treats toys like hand-me-downs, that they can easily be replaced, and that they are not appreciated and will eventually be trashed.<br /><br />Andy's toys however deal with rejection in a different way.  They too feel that they are being rejected and trashed.  But they also understand that Andy is growing up and no longer has a need for toys.  They're not too keen with ending up in the attic storage but at least they won't be trashed.  But these toys are flexible:  All they want is to be played with.<br /><br />Finally, Woody is not too keen on being trashed either.  But he wants to maintain status quo.  He feels that they all belong to Andy and should be loyal to him.<br /><br />All three groups have an epiphany of sorts.  Some adapt and well, some just don't change and end up on the wrong side of (something) (no spoilers, sorry!).<br /><br />There are some scenes that might be a bit intense for smaller kids, but I think Pixar earned its five stars because of what it created here has a story lesson, is not knocking you upside the head with its moral lessons, has some conflict and resolution and is fun to watch.<br /><br />For me, not as charming and fun as Wall-E or Up, but still highly recommended for the kids in your life.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Highly enjoyable fairytale for grownups."></head><body><p>Pan's Labyrinth is not a children's movie, even though it looks like it belongs to the same genre as The Chronicles of Narnia. It's a Civil war drama combining elements of fairytale as subplot. The film features very good performances and high quality production. While there is characters and story is well developed, I feel that there was not enough fairy activity or special effects. There was really just the Faun, his miniature fairies and that canibalistic monster. I just thought that there is not enough coverage of world of the fairies when the little's girl Ofelia/fairy princess returned to eventually. It might have a been a budget limitation, since there would have to been all these elaborate sets and creatures...This film could've been perfect if they had a much bigger budget so it would have a more visual feast impact.</p></body></html>

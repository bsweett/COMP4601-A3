<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly good"></head><body><p>Every now and then in the sea of needless and lifeless horror remakes, a little gem will occasionally shine on through.  Breck Eisner's remake of George Romero's 1973 gem The Crazies is just that, which trades Romero's brand of chaotic paranoia for some honest-to-God thrills.  Timothy Olyphant stars as the local sheriff, who along with his doctor wife (Radha Mitchell) try to survive when the citizens of their small town become homicidal maniacs, as well as the subsequent quarantine by the military.  The Crazies doesn't feature anything that any horror fan hasn't seen plenty of times before, but it features some genuine thrills and chills, solid performances from Olyphant and Mitchell, and a decent amount of political commentary to get its point across.  It doesn't have the same kind of effect of leaving the viewer with a great deal of unease like Romero's original film did, but for what it's worth, this remake of The Crazies is a surprisingly worthwhile endeavor regardless.</p></body></html>

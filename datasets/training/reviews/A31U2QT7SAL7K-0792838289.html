<meta name="summary" content="Still potent after all these years!!!"></head><body><p>With the recent passing of Janet Leigh, all the major players in the film, with the exception of Angela Lansbury and Henry Silva, have gone to that "Hollywood" in the sky. While they're no longer with us, it is fortunate that we, as movie fans, can relish in some of their finest work.<br /><br />Frank Sinatra, Lawrence Harvey, Khigh Deigh, and James Gregory are superb in their respective roles in one of the tautest thrillers in cinematic history. Director John Frankenheimer deserves all the credit for pulling this all together for a film that still rocks after four decades.<br /><br />One can't praise Lansbury enough for her unparalleled performance as the greatest "anti-mother of all time." Lansbury was most certainly shortchanged by Oscar voters when she didn't walk away with the coveted "Best Actress" award the year following the film's release.<br /><br />Supplemental features add "color" to the black and white film as Sinatra, Lansbury, director Oliver Stone, and others, offer their respective opinions on the making of this timeless film.<br /><br />Cast your "vote" for this candidate by adding it to your DVD collection.</p></body></html>

The movie, in fact, is more of a courtroom drama with supernatural elements than a flat-out horror film in its own right.<br /><br />Based on a true story, the film begins with the death of a 19-year-old girl from what appears to be a botched exorcism.  The priest in charge of the ritual, Father Moore, is arrested and put on trial for negligent homicide.  Erin Bruner, a self-described "woman of doubt," is the attorney hired by the Catholic archdiocese to defend the case.  At first, Bruner is skeptical of Father Moore's story of what happened to the girl, but after she herself begins to experience strange, unexplainable phenomena in her own life, she comes to believe that there just might be a plausible supernatural explanation for the death.<br /><br />Eschewing most of the over-the-top silliness usually associated with demon-possession scenarios, "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" prefers, instead, to concentrate on the running battle between science and rationality on one side and religion and faith on the other that has become a commonplace in our more enlightened modern times.  Although the movie clearly sides with the supernatural explanation, it still leaves room for the more skeptical among us to have their say.  The dialogue is generally sharp, insightful and thought provoking and the screenplay treats the spokespersons from both sides of the argument with dignity and respect.<br /><br />Although this film is set in the rural Midwest, the actual "Emily Rose" was a German girl named Anneliese Michel who died in 1976 and whose grave in Germany has since become a pilgrimage site for believers convinced that she was indeed possessed by Satan.<br /><br />The real focus of the film, however, is on the lawyer, Bruner, who undergoes a spiritual reassessment as a result of her involvement in the case.  Laura Linney, as always, brings a seriousness and intelligence to her role of a woman who has her entire view of the world and how it works irrevocably shaken up and altered by the experience.<br /><br />Diehard horror film fans may be disappointed by the relatively short shrift given to the possession sequences, which are seen only in flashbacks and, which, despite their commendable restraint, often have the feel of a warmed-over "Exorcist" about them (although that is practically inevitable with any movie on this subject at this point, I would imagine).  However, it is as a courtroom drama that the film scores most of its hits, and those of us who have watched with dismay the steady degeneration of the horror movie genre of late are quick to welcome this approach.</p></body></html>

In Mexico City, former CIA assassin John Creasy (Washington) is hired by a wealthy Mexican businessman (Marc Anthony) to protect his daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning). As Creasy forms a close friendship with the child, she helps him recover some of his humanity. When Pita is kidnapped and her ransom attempt goes wrong, Creasy resorts to brutal methods to punish those responsible for the kidnapping. "Man on Fire" is a gripping thriller from director Tony Scott (Crimson Tide & Enemy of the State). Despite the film's lengthy running time, the storyline holds out well and features some good twists. There are some pretty good action sequences and intense scenes of Washington's character torturing criminals to uncover the truth behind the kidnapping. Denzel Washington's top-notch performance is the film's biggest highlight. "Man on Fire" also stars Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken.<br /><br />Like many previous Blu-Ray releases from Twentieth Century Fox, "Man on Fire" falls short. The 2004 thriller is presented in a fine 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen format. Despite the presence of grain in some scenes, the video transfer offers rich natural colors, great detail and notable resolution. The DTS-HD audio is dynamic with some good surround effects. Unfortunately, the only extras in this Blu-Ray are the theatrical trailers for "Man on Fire" and other Twentieth Century Fox releases. If you're looking for special features, the 2-disc Collector Edition DVD is a better choice. Overall, "Man on Fire" gets a "B-".</p></body></html>

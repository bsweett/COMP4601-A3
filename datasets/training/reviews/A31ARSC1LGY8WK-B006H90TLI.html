<meta name="summary" content="Well-made but blood-soaked and depressing mood piece from the Coens"></head><body><p>The Coens return to "Fargo" territory with a blood-soaked tale of local yokels coming up against big city criminals, however, this time the result is completely reversed. Javier Bardem is creepy as a "grim reaper" type and Josh Brolin is excellent as an opportunist who gets in way over his head. Tommy Lee Jones and Woody Harrelson have small but telling parts as an old cop and "fixer", respectively. The only thing that detracts from this film - and the same is true of all Coen films - is the frequent and unnecessary brutality that the Coen's enjoy wallowing in.</p></body></html>

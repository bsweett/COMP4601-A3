It's trying to make a very specific point (the American health care system is seriously broken), and pulls out all the stops to do so. It does so with all the usual wit and humor of Michael Moore, which to my mind is a good thing.<br /><br />The movie focuses on various middle-class people who generally thought they had decent medical coverage. They usually thought this right up to the point where they needed it and then... pft. They find out they aren't covered for things, or that stuff they weren't aware they had are listed as pre-existing conditions. They aren't eligable for certain treatments. They have large co-pays and deductables. They can't see the doctors they want to do. The doctors can't give them the treatment they want to give them because the patients can't afford it, etc, etc, etc.<br /><br />Part of the problem with the American health care system, and something that's made plain in the movie, is that it's being run by for-profit insurance companies that have a vested interest in making sure they pay for as little as they possibly can. They want to maximize profits, after all, and I can't blame them for that.<br /><br />There are flaws in the movie. The health care systems in France, Canada and England are painted with too-rosy pictures and nothing showing their flaws. Cuba's health care is presented as magnificent while their human rights issues are glossed-over or ignored (though one can make the point that this movie isn't focusing on human rights, just health care). Some of the problems that do exist with socalized medicine are not addressed.<br /><br />That said, when I think of this problem, I think about my sister and her family. She has a husband and they have four kids. She works and he works. If, god forbid, one of their children got, say, leukemia, then likely one of them would have to quit their job to take care of the kid. Probably the one with the crappier health coverage. That means their income decreases dramatically. Stress goes up. Resentment towards the child due to the incredibly high medical costs can't help but form, irrational though that would be. The parents fight over money. Next thing you know, the $[...] medical bills have sent the family into bankruptcy. They lose their home and have to move into a small apartment. But, hey, in the end, since we do have the best medical care money can buy, at least the daughter is ok.<br /><br />Until the relapse. Or until the working parent gets injured. Or until one of the other kids gets sick. Etc. All those things are horrible enough, but the is the only "real" country where you have to choose between money and medicine and that's just bad. How does our contry benefit from people being made bankrupt by medical bills?<br /><br />The DVD release contains about 80 minutes of footage not seen in the theatrical version. Of note particularly is the segment on Norway. You know, I can't help but think that perhaps if we had minimum security prisons like the ones they show in the movie, instead of the crappy minimum security ones we have here, our crime right might nose down a bit. There could be something to this whole "treat people like people" thing, and focusing on rehabilitation rather than punishment.<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />The message I come away with from this movie is the following: socialized medicine/universal health care is not perfect. Far from it. But it is better than what we have now, and there's no reason we can't do it better than the other countries that have it do. After all, not too horribly long ago we fought the Germans, Italians and the Japanese all at basically the same time. We've gone to the Moon. We have TiVo. Any country that can do all these things can and should have a better health care system than what we have now.<br /><br />See this movie. Even if you don't like Michael Moore, see it (he's not on screen much anyhow). See it, and then do something about it.</p></body></html>

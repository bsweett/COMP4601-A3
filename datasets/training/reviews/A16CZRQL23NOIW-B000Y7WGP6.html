<meta name="summary" content="Bloody, tense and engaging thriller!"></head><body><p>"The kingdom" is a film supported by a well built script, of beating actuality and brutal realism in all sense.<br /><br />The initial sequence provides us of fundamental information around some items of necessary relevance to understand the complex of mixed interests in conflict.<br /><br />A terrorist cell makes a coward attack over dozens of innocent people, this chain of events will lead to F.B.I. to make its appearance as a clash-force in order to detain and stop the future advances of this simple piece of a major complexity.<br /><br />But when the film reaches its entire development there are just there are three problems; the first one has to do with the not well achieved edition process, which makes you turn the attention from certain details of first-order ; (Please notice that, at the moment of the hair raising sequence of the ambush on the highway; make a pause on your DVD and rewind it in slow motion; then check the previous moments before the attack, observe how is the state of the highway, but immediately after, we have another landscape totally different (even the illumination changes); the  second one has to do with the continuity of the narrative thread (For instance, once they arrive to Saudi Arabia, we simply ignore what's going behind political spheres and the way this delicate incident strikes the public opinion).<br /><br />But the climax sequence is not only a deserved tribute to the famous film of Philip Noyce "Game of patriots" in a similar ambush in Bogot&aacute;, superbly well made.<br /><br />Those two defaults make I can't give the film five stars, despite of the fine performances, specially for the natural performance of the Saudi Colonel.<br /><br />The final lines in which we read the same advise for every one of the parts in conflict, express with bitter realism that this battle is barely a bit of a problem still major, in what concerns to the attitude of both sides.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

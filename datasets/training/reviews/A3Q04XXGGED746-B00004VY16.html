<meta name="summary" content="An Imaginative Adventure Story with Graphic Effects"></head><body><p>This tale includes imaginative effects such as mummies coming to life while still mummies, gradually becoming fleshed-out again, and taking the flesh of others to complete the process. The mummies are also capable of causing and leading sandstorms against their adversaries. The figures present in hieroglyphics can come alive and step out of them.  Dung beetles are presented as vicious, flesh-eating beetles that crawl under the skin of their victims, and attack in hordes. Magic incantations, when read out of a secret book, can change everything.<br /><br />Three thousand years ago, an Egyptian priest touched a woman who belonged to the pharaoh. The priest was punished by getting embalmed alive, with flesh-eating beetles devouring his flesh. The pharaoh's wealth was hidden in the area, and it became the subject of centuries of speculation, storytelling, and efforts to locate it.<br /><br />The protagonists of this story manage to find the hidden city (Hamunaptra), which has long been dismissed as fantasy. The stories about pharaoh's wealth are also true. But then they have to tangle with the mummy of the long-ago slain priest who takes their flesh in his efforts to become a fleshed-out human once again. How will they stop him?</p></body></html>

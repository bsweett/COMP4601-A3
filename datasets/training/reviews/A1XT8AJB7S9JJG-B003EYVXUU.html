<meta name="summary" content="A different kind of vampire movie. This is what I think a real life vampire would be like. Not scary or that good. I say C"></head><body><p>A shy boy (Smit-Mcphee) befriends the new girl (Moretz) and discovers a horrifying secret.  After a lifetime of bullying Owen (Smit-Mcphee) meets a mysterious new girl named Abby (Moretz) who teaches him to stand up for himself.  Having never seen the original (Let The Right One In) I went in expecting a vampire thriller.  I had high hopes for this one but it was not what I expected.  It wasn't terrible, just slow.  I may not have paid attention as much as I should have but it seemed like there was no real plot.  As far as I can tell it's a movie about a shy boy making friends with a vampire and trying to co-exist.  This is one of those movies that is OK while watching it but almost instantly forgotten when it's over.  Don't go in expecting the "Twilight" vampires.  This is pretty graphic, with seemingly random killings.  If vampires actually did exist this is what I imagine that they would be like, hidden and trying to fit in.  I give it a C.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - No</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Enter Oddjob, Pussy and the rest of the crew"></head><body><p>One of the more realistic Bond's i.e. one that wasn't completely impossible for it to happen. James Bond sets out to foil the evil plans of Auric Goldfinger to destroy the gold reserves at Fort Knox, in cahoots with Red China. Shooting though several Jamaica, Miami, Switzerland and Kentucky, Bond must battle Goldfinger's brutal minions. Especially the silent, ruthlessly efficient, seemingly invincible and oddly charismatic Oddjob.<br /><br />The plot unfolds slowly but steadily, with witty repartee, and 60's style action.<br /><br />And of course the gorgeous girls bond romances. There is the lovely Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton) , who is cruelly murdered by Goldfinger by being coated in gold paint.  The only parts of the Bond movies that I never enjoy is when one of the beautiful girls die.  They actually make me rather sad actually.<br /><br />The extremely Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman) plays another one of Goldfinger's team and a dangerous adversary for Bond, but great to see her come out well and wooed by Bond onto the side of good (even though she claims at the beginning to be immune to charm).<br /><br />Each of the Bond girls has their own special charm, and Pussy not only knows how to be a smooth operator, she has a body that makes any clothes looks stunning, with a backside that stops conversation. I liked her , I really liked her, and was just so glad she didn't end up as one of the Bond girls who didn't make it through.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A great romantic comedy"></head><body><p>Diane Keaton plays a divorcee who finds love in the strangest of places: with her daughter's 60-something boyfriend (Jack Nicholson), a self-proclaimed playboy who's never had a serious relationship in his life.  The dynamic that makes this movie even more interesting is that both Keaton and Nicholson seem to be playing themselves on screen, or at least they're playing the characters that the media has made them out to be in real life.<br /><br />"Something's Gotta Give" is a wonderful love story that will have you laughing from start to finish.  Nicholson and Keaton have great chemistry, and supporting cast members Frances McDormand and Amanda Peet are fabulous as well.  Keanu Reeves also has a supporting role as a love interest of Keaton's, and he does a fine job (I realize that might be hard for you to believe, but it's the truth).  I definitely recommend this movie to everyone.</p></body></html>

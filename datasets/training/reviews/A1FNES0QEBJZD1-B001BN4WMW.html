<meta name="summary" content="Sapphire Edition of Braveheart on Blu Ray"></head><body><p>Well, started with the initial standard release, then got the Sapphire two movie release with Gladiator and now the Sapphire Blu Ray.  Not interested in summarizing the plots and acting techniques, just the quality of the DVD itself.<br /><br />The video is quite stunning.  Beautiful transfer translates to beautiful, rich and deep colors and details even in the darkest of areas.  I have no complaints at all.  Just gorgeous.<br /><br />The audio is Dolby True HD 5.1 and sounds good.  Most of the film takes place in front of the camera and therefore most of the audio is placed in the front stage of your audio system.  The actual music score is evenly spread across the sound stage very nicely. While the rear channels are used primarily for ambience, not much discreet channeling takes place here.  I would think, that for the battle scenes, especially, the rears could have had more foley effects directed to them.  Not so.  The sub gets down pretty deep in parts but overall, while good, I would not use this DVD as an audio demo.  I might use the video as a demo, just not the audio.<br /><br />This is a two disc set and the first disc(with the film) has a very interesting historical timeline with much to read as well as accompanying short documentaries .  Since this movie is not reality 100% historically accurate, this timeline is quite beneficial and interesting for those who enjoy historical aspects as I do.  The second disc contains many other extras that I also welcomed tho I am not usually enamored with DVD extras.<br /><br />I give the movie as entertainment 5 stars.  The video 5 stars and the audio 3.5 stars.  Hopefully this review has been of some help and, if so, click on the 'helpful' button so I know I am on the right path with it.</p></body></html>

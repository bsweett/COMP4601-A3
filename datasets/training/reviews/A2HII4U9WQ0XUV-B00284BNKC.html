No, correction: let's take a stroll down the big broad generous boardwalk of Coney Island, down past the Carousel of Dying Dreams, pausing a moment to stare at the Ferris Wheel of Decay and Death and Dissolution.<br /><br />No. Don't stare. Darron Aronofsky's sophomore effort, "Requiem for a Dream", is a subversive instrument. It should be regulated by the secret police. It is a vicious sucker punch to the unprepared, unsuspecting kidney masquerading as an anti-drug flick. Be warned, this godawful thing has teeth. You will cry. You will blanch. Your face, virtuous, untainted by human sin (relatively, in our Relative World), will get all white and taut. You will get sick at your stomach. You might puke.<br /><br />OK, there; disclaimers out of the way. Ma Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn, amazing, truly, descended from Heaven with a fiery sword of Truth, I sh*t thee not) is a pudgy, rugose widow who dreams of getting on the game show she watches with cultic fervor. She lives in Brooklyn. She's aging, bored, flabby, tired. She is Hungry.<br /><br />Her son Harry Goldfarb (the incomparable Jared Leto): living on the fringe in Brooklyn, hooking up with his needle-romancing friends on the fringes of a decaying Coney Island. Harry wants to be rich. He wants to fly. He wants to do the funky chicken dance only unrestricted "H" can bring about. He dreams of the big score. He wants to buy Ma Goldfarb a huge-a**ed Tee-Vee, where she can watch Gameshows Valhalla-style. He is Hungry.<br /><br />Oh, but there's more: Dreams are like that. Like wars, they have dictionaries of casualties. There is an infinite supply of fresh, warm-blooded young meat for the grinder. Shall we continue? We shall. There's Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans, redeeming himself), who imagines himself to be a better man---for his own life, for his progeny---than he is. He wants a quick, fast, fat, profitable score. Who can blame him? Who wants to eat catfood in retirement? Hungry.<br /><br />But now, we can't forget Marion Silver (the astonishingly gorgeous Jennifer Connelly). Can we? We cannot. She is gorgeous. Her skin pulses with life. She is a rebel. She doesn't care. Ah, but she does. Youth cares, yes it does, for maybe it doesn't know of old age, but it can feel the thing's stinking corpse-breath. So yeah, Marion will deal---but she'd prefer not to. Which is why she goes along with Harry Goldfarb's "score". Hungry? Yup.<br /><br />Half of the horror is watching a field of roses go up in a napalm strike: in that spirit, I won't spoil anything for you. Well, other than to say this: Love, as some sage once observed, is the most furiously dangerous trap of all. Darren Aronofsky has set horror to celluloid: the horror of a billion lives of quiet, and noisy, desperation. Be afraid: be very afraid.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

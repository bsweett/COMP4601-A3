<meta name="summary" content="Great blockbuster fun"></head><body><p>A lot of people beforehand have slated this movie for lack of plot or over-reliance of special effects.  However, the joy of 'Independence Day' is precisely that - it never pretends to be anything else.  As pure escapist fun it's the top of its range.  The premise is childishly simple: have a group of alien ships hover over the world's great cities and watch how the humans react.  Not only is this an alien movie that takes advantage of the 'X-Files' phenomena but it's also a disaster movie, with there being a cross-section of America reacting to the events around them.<p>The acting is surprisingly good whilst remaining thankfully low-key.  Smith especially shows his star potential, and can obviously carry a movie by himself.  Around him are the more seasoned actors such as Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman as the president.  The special effects are mind-blowing and the creators obviously had a lot of fun making the movie, although at times melodrama does threaten to sink everything.  What's perhaps most cloying though is its blatant vision of a world crisis that only affects America and one that only America can combat.  However, the hoky message about human spirit is tongue-in-cheek and this is a cut above most blockbusters.</p></body></html>

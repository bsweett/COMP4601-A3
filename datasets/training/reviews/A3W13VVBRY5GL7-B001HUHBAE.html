<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding thriller, totally absorbing movie"></head><body><p>"Zodiac" takes the lives of several people associated with the notorious serial killer of the same pseudonym and, over the course of thirty years, charts their efforts and involvements with the case.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when watching "Zodiac" is the direction: David Fichter, masterful genius behind other such thrillers as "Se7en", "Fight Club", and "Panic Room", weaves a beguiling sense of glossy mainstream Hollywood - there's a surreality and a sense of plastic-fantastic to the desaturated, yellowish shots and beautifully disconnected panoramas of San Francisco Bay - and then firmly and squarely yanks the rug out from under our feet with some very visceral murder scenes. His clever use of claustrophobic camerawork during interior and conversation set-pieces serves to further our connection both with Zodiac's victims and the movie's heroes, and the entire movie runs at a deliberately languid pace. It's certainly no tense slash-n'-hack thriller, but David Fichter's talent behind the camera means that "Zodiac" rewards us instead with a thoroughly absorbing 157 minutes.<br /><br />Acting-wise, there aren't any weak points: Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr. and Jake Gyllenhaal, excellent to a man, receive more than ample support from Chlo? Sevigny, Anthony Edwards and Brian Cox, with John Carroll Lynch giving a fantastic performance as Arthur Leigh Allen. In sum, the acting in "Zodiac" is more than a match for the fantastic direction. Similarly, James Vanderbilt's screenplay, from the original Robert Graysmith book, is top-drawer: as someone unfamiliar with the Zodiac murders I was kept guessing until the final frames, and that, to me, is the mark of a great thriller.<br /><br />All in all, "Zodiac" is one of the across-the-board best films I've seen in a long time. Thoroughly recommended.</p></body></html>

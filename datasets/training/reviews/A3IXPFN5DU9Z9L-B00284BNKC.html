<meta name="summary" content="A Sobering Tale of Addition, Drugs and Broken Dreams"></head><body><p>Elegant and melancholy, Requiem is an unsettling drama that is as beautiful visually as its subject matter is depressing.<br /><br />Each scene is excellently framed and contrasts in lighting, colors and settings allow the film's mood to parallel the highs and lows of the character's circumstances. As their predicament spirals out of control, and they shed the last vestiges of dignity and restraint, the film hurls you into their darkness - a chasm of moral bankruptcy, hopelessness and decrepitude.<br /><br />Requiem approaches the material with an objectivity that often feels brutally cold, but it handles the characters with a tenderness that makes their already mournful fates emotionally crushing for the viewer. The film does not offer us the comfort of a happy ending, so don't expect to go home smiling.<br /><br />The movie ultimately ends on a note that is starkly (and unavoidably) anti-drug, but this is not a preachy movie with some hidden moral agenda. The objective here is not to highlight the evils of drug use, but to mourn the human cost, weighed in hopes dashed, lives derailed and loves forsaken. This is after all, a requiem, a rueful ode to dreams buried and lost forever.<br /><br />The Directors Cut DVD is the only version you should consider buying. It contains the full unedited version with mature material that was removed from the watered down theatrical version. Not a movie you'll watch often, but one that will always resonate when you do. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

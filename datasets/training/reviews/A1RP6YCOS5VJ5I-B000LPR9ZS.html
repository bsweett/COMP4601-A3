It gives Amanda a lot of backstory, including how and why she really became an apprentice of Jigsaw. There are a lot of scenes that will make you squirm in the film, worse things than what they have shown in the previous two films. The written is still engaging and it is easy to be sucked into the story as you watch every twisted thing that is done to the victims. After the movie ended, I got the feeling that Jigsaw wasn't so bad and I was able to understand why he does what he does. There is almost an empathy to Jigsaw when it shows more of his past as well. Overall, this is a movie that should end the trilogy and not have a fourth movie. I hear rumors of a fourth movie in the works, but the perfect ending is with this movie</p></body></html>

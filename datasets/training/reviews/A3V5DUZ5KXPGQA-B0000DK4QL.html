<meta name="summary" content="The Director's Cut Is The Better Film Plus Great Bonus Features!"></head><body><p>I have to agree with Mauricio J. Heilbron Jr, MD in that this film gets slammed more than it deserves. While nothing mind blowing, I have to say this story was better than Ang Lee's HULK. My only real knock on it is there was spots that should've been explained like how did Matt Murdock get through school and into college? Where did he live during that time between his lawyer/Daredevil days and the days after his father's death?<br /><br />Still, I believe this film is the victim of the "Spider-Man" shadow. Don't get me wrong, I loved Spider-Man but it seems that every film based on a Marvel Character (with the exceptions of X-Men and Blade) gets compared to Spider-Man and I think that's so unfair. DD especially gets it because despite his own great history, most in the mainstream remember him as a on/off partner of the famous wallcrawler (though I would love if one day they did a film with those two teaming up).<br /><br />Anyway, Ben Afflick is okay as Daredevil. Jennifer Garder did surprise me as Elektra. Colin Ferrel is excellent as Bullseye and Michael Clarke Duncan does a very believable Kingpin!<br /><br />I recently bought the blu-ray version of this film and it is great! It features the director's cut of Daredevil (which is the superior version in my view) and all the special features from BOTH the original 2 disc theatrical release and the original director's cut release! This improved film along with the bonus features make this THE version of DD to own!<br /><br />On the D.C. version, it goes from basically a hero looking for revenge for the death of his father and lover (Elektra) to a darker, more brooding anti-hero who seeks redemption. It also shows the Kingpin as more of a threat than the original theatrical release did and it features a subplot that makes the film make more sense and ties it together better! In one of the bonus features, it is revealed the reason the subplot was removed was for 1. time and 2. to make it PG-13 so that younger viewers could see it.<br /><br />While I know you have to do what the studio wants (and it wanted a PG or PG-13 film), DD is best told as an R-rated type film. While he isn't The Punisher, he isn't Spider-Man either. I personally wish this would've been the film that would've gotten released.<br /><br />Well, I digress and say that if you want to see this film and have a blu-ray player or a machine that plays blu-ray discs, GET THIS VERSION!</p></body></html>

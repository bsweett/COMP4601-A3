This is how the story goes: A veteran engineer and a young conductor try frantically to stop a half-mile-long freight train carrying enough combustible liquids and poisonous gas to wipe out a nearby city.<br /><br />The cast led by Denzel Washington (as Frank Barnes) & Chris Pine (as Will Coulson) is excellent! The directing by Tony Scott (also produced) (who also directed Denzel in "Crimson Tide" (1995), "Man On Fire" (2004), "Deja Vu" (2006) & "The Taking Of Pelham 1 2 3" (2009) is excellent! The story & screenplay by Mark Bomback (who also did the story & screenplay to "Godsend" (2004, also co-produced), "Live Free Or Die Hard" (2007) & the screenplay to "Race To Witch Mountain" (2009) is excellent!<br /><br />The music by Harry Gregson-Williams (who has been doing the music to Scott's films since "Enemy Of The State" (1998) is excellent! The cinematography by Ben Seresin (who also did the cinematography to "Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen" (2009) & the upcoming "X-Men: First Class" (2011) is excellent! The film editing by Robert Duffy (who also did the film editing to "The Cell" (2000) & Chris Lebenzon (who is doing the film editing to the upcoming "Frankenweenie" (2012), he also did the film editing to Scott's "Top Gun" (1986), "Beverly Hills Cop II" (1987), "Revenge" (1990), "Days Of Thunder" (1990), "Crimson Tide", "Enemy Of The State", "Deja Vu" & "The Taking Of Pelham 1 2 3") is excellent! The casting by Denise Chamian (who also did the casting to Scott's "Domino" (2005), "Deja Vu" & "The Taking Of Pelham 1 2 3", she is also doing the casting to the upcoming "Rango" (2011), "The Thing" (2011), "The Rum Diary" (2011), "Water For Elephants" (2011) & "Transformers: Dark Of The Moon" (2011) is excellent! The production design by Chris Seagers (who has been doing the production design to Scott's films since "Man On Fire", he is also doing the production design to the upcoming "The Rum Diary" & "X-Men: First Class") is excellent! The art direction by Julian Ashby (who also did the art direction to "Troy" (2004), "National Treasure: Book Of Secrets" (2007) & "Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen"), Drew Boughton (who also did the art direction to "Austin Powers In Goldmember" (2002), "House Of Sand And Fog" (2003), "The Skeleton Key" (2005), "Domino", "Deja Vu", "National Treasure: Book Of Secrets" & the upcoming "Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides" (2011) & Dawn Swiderski (who also did the art direction to "Spider-Man 3" (2007), "Hancock" (2008), "Angels & Demons" (2009) & the upcoming "The Rum Diary") is excellent! The set decoration by Rosemary Brandenburg (who also did the set decoration to "Deja Vu", "Transformers" (2007), "Hancock", "Public Enemies" (2009) & the upcoming "The Rum Diary") is excellent! The costume design by Penny Rose (who also did the costume design to "Mission: Impossible" (1996), "The Parent Trap" (1998), "Entrapment" (1999), "King Arthur" (2004), "Wild Hogs" (2007), "Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time" (2010) & the Pirates Of The Caribbean movies, including its upcoming fourth sequel, "On Stranger Tides") is excellent!<br /><br />This is an excellent movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat and thinking at the same time. Denzel Washington & Tony Scott have made another excellent film together. This is one of their best films, if not, the best film, together. This is one of the best action films of the year and one of the best films of the holiday season, thus far.</p></body></html>

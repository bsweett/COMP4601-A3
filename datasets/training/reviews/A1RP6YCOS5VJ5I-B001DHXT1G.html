<meta name="summary" content="Let's Have A Sequel!"></head><body><p>Being a fan of the Bill Bixby series, I loved this movie and it's references to that TV series. The best part about the movie is that you can tell this Hulk is angry. I actually got scared at some parts because this Hulk is out for blood and that is the way it should be. Ferrigno finally got to talk for the Hulk in a movie (not including the cartoon series). I loved it and thought it is very well done and I hope they make a sequel. Sadly, the last time I heard, they weren't going to :(</p></body></html>

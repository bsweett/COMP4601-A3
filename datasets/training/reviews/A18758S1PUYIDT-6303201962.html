<meta name="summary" content="One of the most entertaining films ever made"></head><body><p>I've watched this so many times that I think I've memorized it.  And why not?  It's always entertaining.  You can't beat Montalban hissing and threatening as the insanely vengeful Khan, Shatner in a controlled performance as the aging Kirk who finds out about a relative he didn't know he had and also loses someone close to him, Bibi Besch as the lovely and sensitive Carol Marcus, Nimoy and Kelley maintaining the right balance for Shatner, Nimoy giving a very moving performance towards the end, and Koenig and Winfield suffering very palpably under the influence of those nasty little Ceti eels!<br /><br />The director's cut mainly provides some extended footage and a few more lines of dialogue here and there.  Of course, it's also a better resolution than before.  I did not watch the extra features but they sound good.<br /><br />If you like the story, I highly recommend the novelization of it too.<br /><br />Get the popcorn and enjoy this film!</p></body></html>

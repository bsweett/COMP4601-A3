<meta name="summary" content="IT WILL STICK WITH YOU..."></head><body><p>This is one of those movies that raises the question, what if? What if this kind of technology was real, would I have somebody or something erased, and if I did who or what would it be?<br /><br /> Upon first viewing of this movie I thought it was a little drawn out and not as entertaining as I thought it would be, but as the days pass I find myself thinking about it and thinking about who or what I would erase and I find that I can't get this movie out of my head, and by that standard I find this to be a great movie.<br /><br /> Definitely worth the watch, but don't expect the Jim Carrey of old.</p></body></html>

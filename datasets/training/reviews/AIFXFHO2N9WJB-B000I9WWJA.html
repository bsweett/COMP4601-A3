With that being said there are a couple of directors that I find this to be a particularly hard task to succeed in, Quentin Tarentino is one such director and the other is Spike Lee.  I have to say that whenever either of these two critically acclaimed directors releases a movie (or a `joint' as Spike Lee prefers to label them), I find it difficult to get too excited about seeing them, and sometimes I don't end up seeing the movie at all, though I try to make an effort because you never know when one might hit you just right.  So, when I saw the trailer for the upcoming Spike Lee movie "Inside Man" starring Denzel Washington and Clive Owen, I was somewhat interested in it simply because I enjoy both actors' work; however, Denzel had done a Spike Lee movie before that I didn't like, so that didn't guarantee that I would enjoy him in this one.  Over time I saw more trailers for the movie and read what the film was to be about and I have to say that for the first time ever, I was actually excited to see a Spike Lee movie, but whether my anticipation was misplaced or completely justified would remain to be seen.<br /><br />"Inside Man" presents us with the story of a brilliant criminal mastermind (Clive Owen) who has devised the perfect bank robbery and subsequent escape without being caught by the law.  However, when the plan is hatched events quickly begin to spiral out of control and the police are fast on the scene led by a cunningly smart detective (Denzel Washington) who will not rest until the situation is contained.  Just when negotiations are beginning to take shape between the criminals and the police, a government power broker (Jodie Foster) interferes throwing this delicate matter into a state of uncertainty where one wrong move could spell disaster for all involved.<br /><br />After watching this movie I quickly came to the conclusion that even though I generally dislike most Spike Lee movies, even he can surprise me sometimes.  "Inside Man" was a wonderfully constructed cat-and-mouse thriller that was completely engrossing and a genuine surprise to me, and was by far the most mainstream Spike Lee movie to date.  The story was well paced, full of twists-and-turns that you don't see coming, and the dialogue was so well-written and at times an absolute joy to listen to, especially the many exchanges between Denzel Washington and Clive Owen's characters.  The acting was terrific from all actors involved, each actor was given so much to work with, which is often a rarity in an ensemble piece like this one, where there are so many A-list actors gathered in one film, generally one or two of them get shorted on development.  A lot of the fun I had in watching this movie was trying to figure out the various motives every character had or which side they were truly on, so many of the characters had hidden agendas you really didn't know what to expect from any of them, which made the experience all the more enjoyable for me.<br /><br />As I said earlier I'm not by any means a Spike Lee fan and enjoying this movie doesn't change that fact, but for me to have been even remotely entertained by this film is a feat in and of itself.  With all that being said, I think it would be nice to see more independent-type directors, such as Spike Lee or Quentin Tarentino, make more mainstream films and maybe, just maybe, I would like their work a whole lot more than simply one movie here and there.<br /><br />"Inside Man" is rated R for violence and language.</p></body></html>

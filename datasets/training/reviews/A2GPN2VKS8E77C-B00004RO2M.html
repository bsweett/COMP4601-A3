<meta name="summary" content="Not A Cohesive Narrative. The Best Bit Is The First Half."></head><body><p>I saw this crappy movie just out of curiosity about Vincent D'Onofrio aka Goren in his early days. It's not even worth one viewing. The best part of the movie is the first half, parts of which (I think) are viewable online; and R. Lee Ermey (a real-life soldier in the army) is hilarious as Sergeant Hartmann. I really dislike this movie because it's not a cohesive narrative. There's not one character (except maybe Gomer Pyle) that you can really care about, but even Pyle doesn't get enough screen time. It's just as if there are two parts of an idea assembled in a hurry, and the result is a huge mess. To quote a blurb describing another movie, "Scattershot narrative." Worth only one viewing. Not as bad as "Scarface" (1982), but almost. Rated R.</p></body></html>

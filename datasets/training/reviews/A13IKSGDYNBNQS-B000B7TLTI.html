<meta name="summary" content="Great film for all"></head><body><p>This is well worth getting, especially if you can pick it up cheap.<br />The film itself is great for people of all ages. However, as it says on the DVD case if the kids are very small you might wish to watch it with them the first time.<br /><br />Theres much for adults to enjoy here, including some perceptive stuff about work place frustration, which Mr Incredible fails to keep under control! The family scenes will also remind adults of the joys and the difficulties of running a family household. Like a lot of modern digital animations this film works on different levels for different people. The kids on the other-hand will love the superhero fights and the exciting set-piece battles.<br /><br />I haven't watched the extras yet but they look interesting and combined with the main film will give you hours and hours of entertainment.</p></body></html>

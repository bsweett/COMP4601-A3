<meta name="summary" content="Gets It Right"></head><body><p>There are two medium range shots in Zodiac of the late and thoroughly unlamented Embarcadero freeway along the waterfront in San Francisco.  That's just one example of how lovingly and accurately -- great period soundtrack too -- the movie recreates the San Francisco of the late 60's and 70's.  The violence of the murders is neither sensationalized or ignored, but necessary to portraying the killer.  Nonetheless, the knife murders in particular are graphic.  Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, and Robert Downey Jr are all excellent, particularly Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo in their scenes together as the trail goes cold for the cop but Gyllenhaal delves ever deeper and dangerously into the case, even at the cost to his personal life.  The movie runs over two hours, but feels a half hour shorter.  (Warning -- spoiler coming in the next sentence.)  But I left the theater feeling that the time spent by Gyllenhaal in pursuing what turns out to be a false suspect was a bit arbitrary as a plot device to drag out the who-dunnit aspect of the case.  Still, for suspense, for accuracy and, most of all, for excellent ensemble work, Zodiac ranks with Breach as one of the fine movies of early 2007.</p></body></html>

The movie is straight up action but the plot can be a bit confusing to viewers who are not familiar with the game or the backstory. The Rock (handsome as ever) stars in the film as an intergalactic Marine. What I enjoyed most about the film was looking at The Rock. However, it was really hard for me to follow the film. I recently reviewed the movie Serenity. Even though I had never seen the television series, I was able to follow the movie. While watching Doom, I saw movement on the screen but I wasn't really sure what was going on. Perhaps this film will be more interesting to people familar with the backstory.</p></body></html>

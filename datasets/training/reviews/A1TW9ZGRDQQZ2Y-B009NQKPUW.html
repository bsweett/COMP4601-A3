Space is a scary place"></head><body><p>I'm a big fan of Alien and Aliens, thought Alien 3 was decent at best and really hated Resurrection, so with Ridley Scott taking us back to the start of the series, Prometheus was one of the top films I was looking forward to in 2012.<br /><br />The plot is mostly about the creation of life on Earth and where we came from. The events take place about 30 years before Ripley and her crew land on a neighboring planet, where they find the same huge alien species that suffered the same fate here. Yes it is confusing at times (hence the four star rating), but I did manage to have most of my questions answered on that one big movie site (ya know the one). It does tarnish the mystery element of the Space Jockey from the first film, but I didn't think it took away anything from the series either. Maybe it didn't reach my high expectations as a whole, but I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.<br /><br />The acting from Noomi Rapace (the new Ripley, or is it the old?) and Michael Fassbender (the new Ash/Bishop android) stole the show. Both were very convincing. Charlize Theron also added quite a bit as well.<br /><br />The IMAX 3-D visuals were clear and impressive. None of the CGI looked bad...well the last minute or so could have been less blurry. You'll know the iconic moment when you see it.<br /><br />I read that Ridley Scott said he will be releasing the Blu-ray with 20 extra minutes. Like Kingdom of Heaven, I think this will elevate the movie even farther than this shorter cut.<br /><br />Smart, beautiful, intense and full of questions to ponder over long after you have left the theater, Prometheus is one of the strongest Sci-Fi films I've seen in a long time.</p></body></html>

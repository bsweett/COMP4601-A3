<meta name="summary" content="Worst. Movie. Ever."></head><body><p>I wish I had some of what the Academy of Motion Pictures was smoking the day they voted this as Best Picture.  I see in other reviews a lot of words being tossed around, crowing praises about this film: "minimalist," "thriller," "classic," "bone-chilling," and "masterpiece."  I heartily disagree.  As much as I love movies, as many as I have seen, this is hands down the most pointless, heartless, meandering, and senselessly violent movie ever turned out of Hollywood.<br /><br />People who say they understand this film, were excited by it, loved it or whatever strike me as the same folks who praised the Emperor's new clothes as he paraded around naked.<br /><br />Save your money.  This is not even worth a one-time rental.  It will leave you depressed and disturbed.  If there is a message in the movie, it is that life is a random crapshoot in which you cannot escape your fate, that no one will be spared, and that evil will win in the end.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Iconic Disney Classic..."></head><body><p>This reviewer recently watched "Mary Poppins" for the first time since its original theatrical release in 1964, and found the movie, now in its 45th Anniversary Edition, has lost none of its ability to charm and entertain.  A sweet-souled children's fairy tale disguised as a Walt Disney musical, "Mary Poppins" won five Academy Awards for its songs, its then-cutting edge mixture of animation and live action, and for the performance of a young Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins.<br /><br />In the movie, adapted from the stories by P.L. Travers, Mary Poppins magically arrives at the Banks home in 1910 London to serve as nanny to the two rather neglected Banks children, Jane and Michael.  Firm but fair, the "practically perfect" Mary Poppins restores order to the nursery through a combination of song and magic, and then begins to open the eyes of the children to the posssibilities of life and their own imaginations.  In company with the multi-talented chimney-sweep Bert (Dick Van Dyke), Mary and the children embark on a series of adventures that end up transforming the whole Banks household.<br /><br />Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke were in their prime as singers and dancers, and their talent shows in a series of musical sequences, many with animated accompaniment.  The climactic dance sequence "Chim Chim Cher-ee" takes place on the rooftops of London, as Bert and his fellow chimney sweeps perform for Mary and the children.<br /><br />The movie is a marvel of subtlety, as Mary and Bert use song, humor, and compassion to persuade the harried banker Mr. Banks and his fervent suffregette wife that family should come first.  The sources of Mary's magical powers are left a pleasant mystery, as is the relationship between the prim and proper Mary and the clownishly charming but earthbound Bert.  This two disc edition includes some superb "making of" featurettes and interviews with the surviving cast members.<br /><br />"Mary Poppins: 45th Anniversary Edition" is very highly recommended as outstanding entertainment to Disney fans of all ages.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining for a Cash fan, but could be questionable for others."></head><body><p>I found myself very interested in the movie, mostly because<br /><br />of the "freight train" sound of early, rockabilly Cash.  The<br /><br />movie could almost be called "Ray II" b/c it follows a similiar<br /><br />structure, storyline, and visual style as the Ray Charles flick. The screen writers made the interesting choice of telling Cash's story up to 1968, which overall worked, but does make the movie plod a bit with its 135 minute length (thank god they deleted a ton of scenes at that).  The performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon are as captivating as the music, and overall their love story has intrigue, although it too is a bit drawn out.  Overall, I felt too much time in the heart of the movie was allocated to Cash's drug problem, which heightened the negative feel of the story. Although I realize biographical movies can spread themselves too thin by covering too many aspects/phases of the person's life, I feel this one could've<br /><br />been a bit more dynamic in the approach.  Overall, the storyline was too focused on his failed marriage, pill<br /><br />habit, and love for June.  I felt I didn't learn or experience as much as I could have.  However, overall I'd recommend the movie and the performances, especially for the toe-tappers out there.</p></body></html>

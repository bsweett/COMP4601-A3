<meta name="summary" content="Are You the Same People Crying about Waterboarding...?"></head><body><p>I watched TAKEN with some friends last night and enjoyed the movie.  It's fast-moving, slick, driving entertainment.  The cast is great, especially Liam Neeson as an ex-CIA operative doting on a teen daughter he never really knew.<br /><br />But I was trying to reconcile how Americans can love a movie like this so much (where a former CIA operative beats with extreme prejudice, tortures with extreme prejudice and kills with extreme prejudice) and yet turn all kinds of squeamish and hand-wringing when it comes to dealing with real-life terrorists really trying to kill us.<br /><br />Does it have to be your daughter before you care?  Would you trust Liam Neeson to do the waterboarding?  Is it easy to "pretend" to like this stuff in a world where it isn't "pretend"?<br /><br />Just something I wondered after listening to friends after the movie.<br /><br />But it's a cool movie.  The plot is lean and fast-moving.  The horrible crime of sexual slavery is addressed only to get the plot moving but isn't used to prick anyone's conscious, just provide a story of rescue.</p></body></html>

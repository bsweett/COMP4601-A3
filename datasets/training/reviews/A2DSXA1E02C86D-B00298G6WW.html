<meta name="summary" content="A mildly engaging non-sequitur"></head><body><p>Consider this exchange between two very disparate strangers that become good friends and drinking buddies in a foreign land:<br /><br />International Businessman: "I want you to kill my chief competitor."<br />International Assassin: "I won't do it. The guilt would corrode you for the rest of your life."<br /><br />Then, several months later:<br /><br />International Assassin (to International Businessman): "You owe me a favor. I want you to help me kill someone."<br /><br />Mind you, the favor for which International Businessman is indebted is the refusal by International Assassin to do something that will cause the former lifelong guilt. Given that, the favor the latter now asks for would seem a total disconnect considering the depth of their friendship.<br /><br />In THE MATADOR, Pierce Brosnan plays international killer-for-hire Julian Noble. While on a job in Mexico City, he meets international businessman Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in a hotel watering hole. The two become buds after some initial awkwardness. They bond at a bullfight, during which Julian, lulled by Danny's "Mr. (w)Right", all-American goodness and naivet&eacute;, reveals to his new chum his line of work. Danny is incredulous at first, a feeling that transitions to shocked belief as Julian demonstrates how to set up a hit on a man in the spectator crowd that Wright randomly picks. In the succeeding six months, Noble, apparently suffering a nervous breakdown, fails at a couple of assignments and falls into his employer's extreme disfavor. One night, a needy Julian shows up on the doorstep of the comfortable suburban home Danny shares with his wife Bean (Hope Davis).<br /><br />The main attraction of this film is watching Brosnan, perhaps unrecognizable at first, play the role of the hard drinking, compulsively wenching killer. With his brush-cut hair, moustache, and pronounced beard stubble, Julian looks more like Saddam Hussein in the dock, or perhaps 007 gone to seed after being given the sack by the SIS. But he still manages to exude a crooked-smile charm that attracts Danny and the audience. The downside, for me, was that I really didn't get the plot's point. My wife said the message was that Julian was really a "noble", decent soul that cracked under the stress of his job. Well, OK. This after 12 years in the business. It wasn't convincing, or, even if it was, the premise doesn't seem worth a feature length film.<br /><br />As much fun as Brosnan fans might find in THE MATADOR, wait for the DVD.</p></body></html>

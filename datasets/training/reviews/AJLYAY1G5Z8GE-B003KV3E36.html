<meta name="summary" content="Too Violent But a Good Action Movie!"></head><body><p>A movie about the war crimes in Burma where a group of peace advocates travel there but get caught by the brutal army.<br />John Rambo tries to rescue them, and of course is able to defeat the whole army.<br /><br />Great Action. Really well direct. However very violent.<br /><br />The violence looks so real and is so graphic that will disgust you. You might need to watch the movie in 3 phases since watching it one shot could make you throw up.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Film Set; Great "New"  Versions"></head><body><p>There is not a whole lot I can add when an item has 200 plus reviews.<br /><br />If you watch the films for what they are, most people will like them, and especially the new editions for Alien 3, and Alien Resurrection.<br /><br />As noted, this collection is packed full of extras, and I thoroughly enjoyed the interviews, especially for Alien 3, and resurrection.<br /><br />The Studio interference in Alien 3 is very evident, and the original cut is way better than the theatrical mess.<br /><br />David Fincher had a major problem as director, and that problem was the bean counters at the Studio.<br /><br />ALIEN is evidence of just what a visionary directory can achieve when given free reign, just as ALIENS is evidence of how a good director can make a film work WELL.<br /><br />Alien Resurrection is excellent evidence of how a film can be rescued. Juenet has allegedly  said that he did not know why people went to the studio to be scared, well, his version of the film is trash compared to the 2003 cut.<br /><br />Sadly, this franchise was messed by the studio and showed how "too many cooks spoil the broth".<br /><br />Most importantly, the collection as it is here, shows that the story line is far from fished out, and I feel that an Alien 5 directed and maybe even co-written by Weaver, would be superb.<br /><br />This collection is worth every penny, and then some.</p></body></html>

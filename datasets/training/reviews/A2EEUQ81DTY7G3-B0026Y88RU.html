<meta name="summary" content="A film that tries so hard to be cutting edge, it ends up gratuitous and quite boring."></head><body><p>This ridiculous movie, which is just recycled Quentin Tarrentino brashness, is so ludicrously over-plotted and so absolutely in love with it's hipness that this viewer really had to struggle to get to the end of it. Just like the recent Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Lucky Number Slevin is yet another irreverent excessively violent crime thriller that purports to by edgy and gritty.<br /><br />Thinking their story is smarter, edgier and cleverer than it actually is, the filmmakers hinge the story on a case of mistaken identity. Clad in a low slung towel for most of the film, Josh Hartnett plays Levin, a good-humored twenty-something who misguidedly gets himself caught in a face-off between a thuggish rabbi (Ben Kingsley) and an impassive crime lord (Morgan Freeman) imaginatively named Boss on the streets of New York.<br /><br />There's also Bruce Willis as a cool and smirking hit man, who figures into the mix, as does a flighty coroner (Lucy Liu, the film's lone bright spot) who lives next store to Levin and helps him sort out the various riddles and settle some scores along the way. The film begins with an extended back-story from the 1970's involving gangsters, murder and horseracing and once you put two and two together Slevin's relationship to the underworld kingpins isn't exactly hard to deduce.<br /><br />The movie's final twist is ridiculous and the overly talky script is downright irritating. Slevin's plot twists, action antics and potent cast may hold your interest for about the first ten minutes, but regardless of its immediate violent thrills, this revenge thriller / crime tale gradually loses it's luster as it disentangles in the threadbare threads of its own contrivances.<br /><br />And then there's Josh Hartnett - he's fabulous eye candy, but his performance is so bland and lackluster that it lacks the essential ingredient of urgency. It's the final indignity to an audience who has suffered through two hours of smug sadism - and subliminal homophobia - in the pretext of "entertainment." Stay well away from this one.

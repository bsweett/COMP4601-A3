Who slept there in the bed your sleeping on. What kind of out of sight acts were committed there? Did someone die there?!<br /><br />One of the best ghost, or should I say, poltergeist films in the last 15 years. Scary, creepy, inventive, relentless, & a tour de force acting job by one John Cusack!<br /><br />You might want to camp out next time!</p></body></html>

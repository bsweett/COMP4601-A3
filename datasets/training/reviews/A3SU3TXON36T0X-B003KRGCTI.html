Few humans remain left and water has become a scarce commodity.  Many of the humans have resorted to cannibalism and those who attack the wandering Eli are quickly despatched with his savage blade.  Eli enters a town where he is able to teach a young girl about his religious belief and to pray to God.  However, the leader of the town seeks to impose his will upon the people and has been searching for a copy of the Bible so he may use it towards his evil ends (he also seems to enjoy biographies of Mussolini).  Only one copy of the Bible remains in existence and that is the property of Eli who maintains that he must "head West" under the guidance of a voice he has heard "from within himself" so that he may find an appropriate place for the Bible.  A series of massive gun fights ensue and a couple George and Martha (Washington?) are brought into the matter which occurs in an epic showdown between Eli, the girl, George and Martha, and the rest of the gang looking for the Book outside of a white house.  Eli is wounded but the girl manages to escape; however, the leader has managed to attain the Book despite the fact that he has been injured.  Eli manages to head further West with the girl where he encounters a second remaining society.  This society has a library set up and seeks to spread all human knowledge to the world again through its printing press.  The library contains much of Western culture including books by Shakespeare and the music of Wagner as well as Britannica encyclopedias.  Eli tells the girl that he contains the Bible in his heart and begins dictating the entire Bible to an old wisened librarian who eventually is to complete the entire dictation thus preserving forever knowledge of the Bible (which will be set to the printing press).  In the meantime, after trying to pick the lock on his own Bible the leader of the town discovers that the Bible is written in Braile.  He attempts to have his blind mistress read it for him but she refuses.  Eventually the illiterate men of his town are to revolt against their master.  In the meantime, Eli slowly dies of the wound inflicted upon him but not before completing the entire Bible.  In this manner, the Bible and teachings of Christ will be passed on to a future post-apocalyptic generation.  Earlier in the film Eli had noted that in the war of the past books were burned and destroyed with the exception of the Bible.  I feel that this may be a reference to the internet in which books are pillaged and information is ripe for rampant abuse.  At the end of the film, the girl manages to set out back for home carrying her mission from Eli to return home.  I felt this film was spiritually fulfilling a vacuous post-apocalyptic world.  Eli notes that in the world before the apocalypse people had much but did not appreciate what they had.  His personal faith is quite touching in light of the hostility to such faith in the modern world.  The end of the movie explains the importance of cultural and religious preservationism and through the medium of the printing press the Bible and the Gospel of Christ will continue to live on a for a future generation of people.<br /><br />My main criticism of the film is the excessive violence that Eli delivers in brutally killing animals for food and his opponents in battle.  Eli spares none and carries a sharp blade which he uses to torture and kill all his opponents.  I felt that this was somewhat unbecoming in a film about spiritual truth that emphasizes the golden rule.  The harshness and violence of the film detract from the overall message I felt and for this reason I only gave the film 4 stars.</p></body></html>

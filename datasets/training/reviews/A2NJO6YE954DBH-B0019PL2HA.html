<meta name="summary" content="I find it hard to believe this comedy is made by people who like NASCAR"></head><body><p>Wow. I am sitting watching "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby" and trying to decide if this is a movie made by people who like NASCAR or hate NASCAR. I can see evidence for both perspectives in this 2006 Will Ferrell comedy, but by the time we get to what I will describe as the non-handshake scene between Ferrell's Ricky Bobby and Sacha Baron Cohen's Jean Girard (I would have been worried about their futures by the former has "Stranger Than Fiction" and the later has "Borat" no-I-will-not-do-the-entire-title, so things are looking up for both). So seeing Dale Earnhardt Jr., Darrell Waltrip, and other drives in this movie was something of a surprise. I mean, this is a movie where the title character has to come back from a spectacular crash and where the big race in the finale has what I assume is one of the biggest car crashes in a big race finale of recent memory. Now, I know that car crashes are a part of racing and that people get killed doing them, but Dale Earnhardt Jr. being in a movie that has such fun with car crashes creeps me out a little bit. To be clear, I am not a NASCAR fan. I do not watch car races. But I have to wonder: If I think this film is rather insulting to NASCAR and its fans, then is it not reasonable to think that NASCAR fans would find it even more insulting? This movie made $148,213,377 at the U.S. box-office and there is no way of knowing but I wonder if most of that money can from NASCAR fans or non-NASCAR fans.<br /><br />My wife did not watch this movie, but she walked into the room while I was going through the special features and after watching 15 seconds she turned to me and said, "NASCA endorsed this?" To be clear, she was even more incredulous than I was. However, the special features make it clear that the approach with this movie was apparently not so much writing a script but letting the camera roll will characters tossed off lines. I assume they then went into the screen room and anything anybody actually laughed at they put into the movie (I liked the literary analysis by Walker and Texas Ranger of the Steinbeck story read to them by grandma, although I think Walker and Texas Ranger would be funnier names if the kids were twins). The story is that producers pitched this movie idea to the studios with the six words "Will Ferrell as a NASCAR driver," which must be how they sold it to NASCAR as well because you would hate to think that they read this script and signed off on it. Then again I can see how they could have shown the script to NASCAR and then threaten to make it even worse if NASCAR did not go along with it.<br /><br />This is not to say that "Talladega Nights" is without redeeming social value. There is the important lesson that when your daddy blows into town and stops guzzling bear long enough to lay down a stupid law like "You're either first or your last," you should not let that become your core belief let along your mantra. Of course the lesson would work a bit better if it came from somebody other than daddy in another one of his semi-sober moments, but there is an actual lesson in this movie and that must be acknowledged because it provides cover for some of the other nonsense. This is a movie that takes the stereotypes associated with this sport and the South and embraces them. I think it is making fun of them more so than celebrating them, but that is just my opinion and probably that was the whole point. I just cannot get over the fact that NASCAR signed off and let them do this at their racetracks. To reiterate my opening point: Wow.<br /><br />"Talladega Nights" also raises some interesting theological points, and not just on Ricky Bobby's willingness to call on not only baby Jesus but the Jewish God and Allah when he is trying not to burn to death, which would be an implicit plea for universal oneness and religious tolerance. Ricky Bobby likes to pray to baby Jesus instead of the risen Lord that you would think would be the Jesus people should be praying too. Ricky Bobby's position is not all that extreme given what the types of Jesus that his best friend and sons like to pray to, so he ends up being the voice of moderation here (scary thought). We are all aware that Catholics have the opportunity to pray to different saints who are associated with particular occupations, vocations and situations, so the thought that there is a continuum of Jesuses that you could pray to is rather provocative. Please realize I am talking about something like Jesus at the Wedding in Canaan or Jesus cleansing the Temple in Jerusalem and not the ninja Jesus suggested in this movie. Okay, clearly I am plumbing for depths in shallow waters at this point, but I had all these brain cells I was not using while watching this film and this was actually what went through my mind.</p></body></html>

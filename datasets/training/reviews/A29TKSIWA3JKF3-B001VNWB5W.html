I don't know if that was because I had no other reference point to go by, having never heard of Watchmen or the novel it's taken from.  This left me with no other option than what was presented.  They say presentation is everything, and in this case, Watchmen can't be faulted on style.  On everything else though, serious sensory overload: the music was too loud and intrusive, the undeveloped plot difficult to follow, the `mood' lighting completely left me in the dark (figuratively and literally).  The opening fight sequence was almost completely lost on me, seeing that it was purposely obscured, as was much of this film.  There were far too many flashbacks, hinting at what, most felt incomplete.  There were also far too many characters to juggle, most of them thoroughly unlikable and dealt with in a limited fashion.  It was difficult to pinpoint the villain of the piece as so many were villainous at one time or another.  When the `true' villain was eventually revealed he proved to be so bland and banal it made everything that had come before the great revelation completely laughable.  As the story meandered for 186 minutes I kept thinking, what's the point?  Even when it finally ended, I kept thinking, what's the point?<br />I found this movie smug, pretentious, humorless, and not a little snide.  Being dated was the least of its worries.  Alternate universe or not, it still had to battle for a modicum of relevancy.  And that droning narration throughout was of no help whatsoever.  I didn't just dislike this movie, I hated it.  Even on a cursory level, it failed to entertain me.  Not a keeper and I'm sorry I bought it.</p></body></html>

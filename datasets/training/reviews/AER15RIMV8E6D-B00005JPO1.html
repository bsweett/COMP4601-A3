<meta name="summary" content="Dr. Jones is Back in Action!!!"></head><body><p>Like the other great classic heroes of the 80's, Indiana Jones makes an awesome comeback! I thought the movie was really good and had the classic look of the 1950's! It was cool that the Ark from the original had a brief appearance! It was also awesome to see Marion from 'RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK' back and helping Indy against Russians who are after the Crystal Skull. Shia LaBeouf does an awesome job as a greaser named Mutt Williams who is Marion's son that helps Indy on his journey too. There are some jokes about Indy's age throughout the film which is pretty funny! If you are a big INDIANA JONES fan, then you'll love INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL!!!!<br /><br />P.S. I hope they do make Indy 5!</p></body></html>

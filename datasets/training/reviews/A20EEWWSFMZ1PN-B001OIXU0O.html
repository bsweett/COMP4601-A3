<meta name="summary" content="This is ABBA a not Rodgers and Hammerstein."></head><body><p>This is an international hit musical brought to the silver screen or some sort of Blu-Ray screen. Many screen adoptions fall short of the actual play; yet occasionally they surpass the play because they can show things such as facial expressions and outdoor locations that cannot be seen in a play. Unlike the stage play, this film also is relying on many major actors. Unique and gutsy is the fact that the actors themselves sing the songs.<br /><br />This is definitely a musical. The storyline and dialog are used to glue the songs together. The film is cute entertaining and has a balanced ending where everyone gets what he or she wants, even if he or she does not know what he or she wants. That is what we want.<br /><br />Be sure to view the extras, as it is the extras that add depth to the presentation.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790731452">Mars Attacks! ~  Pierce Brosnan</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Outsourced Dickens"></head><body><p>The camera pans the white monoliths baking in the glaring Indian sun as Jamal's street smart brother Salim waves his hand towards the burgeoning panorama of construction concrete and dust and in a manner of introduction (he has not seen his sibling for years) explains that the site of this savvy new business park in Mumbai's boomtown of finance and commerce once contained the unbelievable (from a Western stance) dichotomy of vibrant patchwork color and dingy garbage-fill filth that like a Bizarro-World sunburnt vision of Legoland constructs the mire mosaic slum in which the Brothers Malik were born.<br /><br />In director Danny Boyle's 2008 film "Slumdog Millionaire" one gets the impression that as the apprehensive Jamal, the child-to-teenage protagonist, struggles to emerge as a viable force with which to be reckoned in his own right--he consistently overcomes one trial of urban treachery after another as all the mythic heroes from Hercules, Jason and Krishna do, literally rising from a sludge of excrement in a moment of quasi-lightness as he imperturbably pursues a coveted autograph from a Bollywood actor helicoptered into the capital amidst a scattershot of plastic and cardboard garbage fluttering as innocuously as autumn leaves--so does modern day India strive to reinvent itself, wishing to shed its reputation of over population and poverty with the apparent ease of a bulldozer flattening acres of slum dwellings to reveal a real-time optical illusion of power and prosperity shimmering with the promise of world-class commercial status after the dust settles.<br /><br />Whether or not Boyle had this analogy in mind, "Slumdog Millionaire" fascinates with its vivid depiction of a transitional India in a twist on the typical rag-to-riches storyline where grossly-over-populated-slum boy makes good and, of course, gets the girl of his dreams. Jamal, a chai-wallah (tea maestro) for a large telecommunications firm inadvertently finds himself on India's version of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" complete with smarmy jokes and a slick Bollywood version of Regis Philbin. Unlucky Slumdog, with just one question to go to win 20 million rupees, is arrested for cheating and spends most of the film's running time in the police station explaining through life-lesson rather than lifeline vignettes just how he knows the answers to questions that have stumped far more educated contestants. Through the devise of flashback, the audience cringes as Jamal and his older brother Salim played initially by younger child actors, watch their mother murdered by a marauding group of Muslim-hating crazies and as orphans fend in a horrific stomach-churning world of harsh endurance that seems more hellish than anything Dante could imagine. Somehow they survive some downright disturbing almost vomit-inducing entrapments escaping from personifications of evil that Dickens would have loved to make you hate. On average Boyle dishes up an extra huge serving of fraternal devotion with zings as tangy as an expertly concocted chutney as the brothers and Jamal's love interest, Latika, barrel through the underbelly of their country undergoing two other actor reincarnations before the final denouement revolving around the television game show studio hot seat.<br /><br />Bottom Line? "Slumdog Millionaire" gruesomely depicts an India that few would want to visit. Set in Mumbai's Dharavi slum, the otherwise could-be predictability of the boy-meets-girl, boy-conquers-adversity formula escapist fare takes on the additional nuance of the travelogue, introducing the viewer beyond the Pillars of Hercules to an unfamiliar world where dragons lie and commerce wants to reign. No one need `ask the audience' for the final answer on this flick--it surely entertains on a variety of levels despite its predictability and almost ruthless exploitation of the viewer's emotions. Recommended especially for young adults.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"</p></body></html>

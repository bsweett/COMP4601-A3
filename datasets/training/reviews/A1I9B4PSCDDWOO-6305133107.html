<meta name="summary" content="Ultimate John Wayne movie"></head><body><p>This review is on the Ultimate Collector's Edition which came out this year.<br /><br />I guess it would be no surprise to anyone if I stated that The Searchers remains John Wayne's greatest film. Virtually everything about the movie remains timeless and its quality proves to be near perfect in almost every way. This movie should dispelled for all times, the fiction that John Wayne cannot act but himself. This movie was Wayne's greatest acting job. This was clearly shown early in the film when Wayne's character realized that his brother's ranch may be doom, the stricken look on that face remains priceless as it conveyed the horror of his mistake and despair behind the stoic behavior. Anyway, with so many previous reviews, I won't go further repeating what been written already.<br /><br />This DVD edition is definitely the ultimate edition as movie of this type could go. The movie image from this edition proves to be a superior improvement from the earlier edition that came out several years ago. The image proves to be clean, color vivid and it almost pristine. The soundtrack is clear, the audio is your basic mono but its also clear.<br /><br />The second disc contained all the extra documentaries. Both documentaries, "The Searcher: A Appreciation" and "Turning of the Earth: John Ford, John Wayne and The Searchers" proves to be insightful, interesting and entertaining.<br /><br />This edition also contains a copy of a 1956 Dell comic book on the movie. It been reduced in size but still readable. I supposed it useful to introduced the story without watching the movie. There is also a b/w booklet that contains many versions of the movie posters, and contemporary media hype on the movie. The other package contains collection of b/w back scene photos which is quite nice.<br /><br />There's also a coupon for a free The Searchers' movie reproduced poster. Unfortunately, the offer expired back several months ago.<br /><br />For people who don't want the extra material, there is the regular two disc edition which is bit cheaper.<br /><br />Overall, the ultimate edition sound bit overpriced but depending on how die-hard John Wayne fan you may be, the cost may be subjective.</p></body></html>

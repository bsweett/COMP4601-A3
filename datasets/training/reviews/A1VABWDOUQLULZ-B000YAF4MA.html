The plot proceeded as expected, and Nicholson has seemingly played a variant of fly-be-free unseemly older man goes off-the-rails in at least two other films.  He does it well, of course, but the role is no test of his skill.  Freeman's character experiences and expresses a wider range of feeling and transition, and it is he the audience comes to identify with most.  The message of the film is uplifting, though decidedly more humorous.  At times it seemed to not know if it was a drama or a comedy. Approach it with humor and it won't disappoint.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Lovely, scary, and heartbreaking"></head><body><p>Not unlike its predecessor, Pan's Labyrinth, this film is beautifully photographed on a dramatic shore with a lighthouse and an old orphanage that has now become home to a couple with an adopted son.  That the parents have kept the adoption and the boy's HIV status a secret from him, and that his mother had grown up in the orphanage, set in motion a chain of sad and frightening events when the ghosts of dead orphans tell the boy the truth.  There's also a woman who had some information and was also a caregiver for a deformed boy; unfortunately, she is accidentally run over before she can tell Laura, the mother, what she needs to know.<br /><br />The boy, Simon, disappears with the ghost kids and his heartbroken parents spend months searching for him.<br /><br />All of this ends with life after death; Laura, Simon and the others die, but they seem to be very much alive, with Laura caring for them in the nursery since they will not grow any older, and Simon is reunited with her as well.<br />There is even a hint at the end that Laura's husband is greeted by her and the boy, though we will never know for sure.<br />It seems to be a common thread in this director's work that the living and the dead, the reality and the fantasy, are very close together and sometimes intermingle with each other.  I will be very curious to see what he does with The Hobbit.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great lead character...in search of a better story"></head><body><p>This was a thin concept that never made enough use of its star - Ron Pereleman.  An indestructible demon brought to Earth by Nazis during WWII (which overlapped with the "Occult Wars"), Hellboy was found by American soldiers and raised by a kindly professor (John Hurt) to fight evil.  Though he can clear tall buildings in a single bound and utter no more than "oh, crap", Perelman brings out a decidedly human side to the character.  HB has been working for our side - specifically the kind of super-secret organization that exists only in comic books or movie adaptations of them.  We first meet HB through the eyes of John Meyers - a young transfer from the FBI, who finds that his new job involves following HB around and making sure to have plenty of candy bars around for the right moment.  Though HB seems to have things under control, two problems nag him.  The first is his unrequited love for Liz (Selma Blair) an emotionally scarred fire-starter (she doesn't like the word "pyrokinetic").  His larger problems involve plans to complete the world-destroying plot that began with HB's arrival on Earth.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie, mostly because Perlman brings surprising earnestness to his role of demon who likes kittens and can't get the girl.  The best thing about comic books is that they work as great ensemble pieces (a team of heroes, or a solitary hero working against a great villain).  Unfortunately, the script gives HB little support.  Rupert Evans as Myers can do little more than follow HB around, and keep him supplied with mounds of pancakes and gallons of chili, and there aren't enough scenes between Perlman and Blair or with his Hurt.  There's a scene midway in which Jeffrey Tambor, HB's reluctant boss, reminds him that theirs is a team effort - yet much of their back-up is anonymous.  Even the villain is generic - the kind of old-world sounding occult dude we had enough of in "Underworld".  The basic plot riffs on Lovecraft, but so did "Ghostbusters" 20 years ago.  In the end, HB becomes little more than Perlman v. CGI, a match that underrates the talents of both Perlman and his character.  HB is still nothing if not satisfying, though you never get past the sense it could have been so much more.</p></body></html>

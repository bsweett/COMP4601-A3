<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie"></head><body><p>This is the only Rocky movie I've seen in theaters. We have all of the other Rocky movies, but I didn't watch them till yesterday. My husband is the Rocky fan. We've had the movies for many years. I don't know why I never watched them before. They are really good movies.<br /><br />I really enjoy this movie. It was crazy seeing how much time's have changed going from the first five Rocky movies to this updated, bright, clear movie. What a nice change. Rocky won at the end of this movie. But in the Deleted Scenes he lost the fight. I think him losing is a better ending. But I guess Rocky wants to live on in peoples mind. I guess he didn't want them to think he is too old to fight. No matter what age he is he can win. I guess that's what Sylvester Stallone is saying.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Altman - A Great "Companion""></head><body><p>I'm here to discredit a rumor that seems to be surfacing on this site. According to some in order to enjoy this movie, you must be a fan of the radio show. I'm going to confess something. I've never listen to or even heard of the radio show before this movie came out. And you know what? I love, absolutely love, "A Prairie Home Companion". So what happened? I thought only fans of the radio show were suppose to like this movie.<br /><br /> That argument is so ridiculous. So in order to like Altman's "Nashville" you'd have to like country music? Or if you enjoyed "The Company", you must love ballet? I'm not much of a country music fan or a ballet fan, yet I enjoyed both films.<br /><br /> "A Prairie Home Companion" is not just a movie about a radio show. It is a film about a forgotten era. It is about reflections of the past and the uncertainity that the future brings.<br /><br /> G.K.'s (Garrison Keillor) radio show, A Prairie Home Companion, is about to end. The movie starts on the last broadcast of the show. Everyone backstage seems a little sad. Here's a show that's been on the air for 30 years, and in a few moments, it's all going to come to an end. But for some reason Keillor is not sad. Or at least he's not showing it. So instead he goes on with the show's program. Which includes various music acts ranging from a sister team, The Johnsons (Meryl Streep and Lilly Tomlin) to a team of singers with an affection for bad jokes (Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly). But lots is going on backstage. Molly (Maya Rudolph), one of the stagehands, is expecting a baby. Guy Noir (Kevin Klein) is the head of security, but seems stuck in a 40's noir film (which helps confirms the film's sense of an era gone by). And a mysterious woman (Virginia Madsen) lurks around. Also Lola Johnson, Streep's daughter (Lindsay Lohan) sticks around for the radio show's last broadcast.<br /><br /> This material is just perfect for Altman's style of moviemaking. As I understand it, this was really a Garrison Keillor project that Altman joined onto. But, Altman makes the film his own. His handling of the material is as comfortable as a worn out shoe. If you recall his last film, "The Company", it had a sense of a documentary. So does this film.<br /><br /> Many people will argue this isn't Altman's best. Perhaps, but the movie is made in the tradition of his best works. And as far as I'm conerned, this is one of the year's best films.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Robert Altman's look at a forgotten era is one of the year's best film. The movie is made in the tradition of Altman's best work. Has a documentary feel to it.</p></body></html>

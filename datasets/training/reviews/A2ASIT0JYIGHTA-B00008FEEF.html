<meta name="summary" content="Halloween 2 barely satisfies"></head><body><p>This movie fails in many ways. It has "let's make a sequel but forget the plot" all over it. Jamie Lee Curtis returns as Michael Meyer's much sought after victim. In a way, she is the film's main drawcard. Check out the wig she wears in this film (apparently her hair was too short compared to the first film, but needed to be rectified because the sequel took place the same night). Ok, can live with that, but how many people go to an empty hospital? Well in this movie, it seems like Jamie Lee Curtis is the only patient there.<br />Halloween 2 does have some scary moments, but it also has a few continuity problems. For example, there is a scene where a nurse is heading to the hospital to work nightshift after being out with a friend, but has to take the friend home first. When they leave the parking spot, Michael is in the carpark and can then be seen walking up the street. But when the nurse arrives at the hospital after dropping her friend off, Michael is in the back seat! Impossible !<br />The film's score is a remixed version of the original Halloween theme and it spoils it in a way. The original score was indeed better.<br />John Carpenter did not direct this film, he produced it (he directed the first film). It is rumoured that he saw problems with this film early on, but was unable to fix it in his capacity. Halloween 2 is only worth owning if you wish to complete the series.<br />DVD SUMMARY: Ok, there are various versions of the DVD floating around. The one I have is pretty bad. It is taken from a dirty film print, and you even get the reel change marks thrown in. The print is non-anamorphic and lacks any sharpness. The audio mix is mono surround. The extras include production notes and a trailer. A Special Edition of this movie may occur one day, but essentially it's a bad film - so unlikely to get it.</p></body></html>

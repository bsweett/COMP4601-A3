This is a thinking man's zombie flick.You wake up in London in a hospital ward. You see the hospital is deserted. You come outside.You see the street is deserted and 10 mins later you figure out pretty much all of London is deserted. You then realise you might be the  only living (sane) thing within miles. Basically we are informed there was a mass exodus from London due to the onset of the pandemic: "the rage" virus which is passed on by transmision of blood or bodily fluid (even saliva). If blood or saliva is orally ingested or if it comes in contact with cells of the body, the infected gets turned into a zombie in 10 seconds and will kill even his nearest and dearest ones turning them into zombies as well. The backdrop of the story is the basic premise of many post holocaust movies. Most such movies deal with a post nuclear war era where the rebellious few overcome the odds of surviving in a devastated environment and live on to start a new civilization. The movie has this edgy character to it. Danny Boyle (trainspotting, the beach, sunshine) shoots the movie in Digital video. Some scenes have this grainy resolution of a home digital camcorder. The movie sustsains interest because it is not a mindless zombie flick. The zombies in this movie are not mindless walking targets of "dawn of the dead" which can be just popped off with a push of a trigger. They are swift, ferocious and very very deadly in a matter of seconds . They come at you relentlessly. They are fast and furious and they are hungry. Good movie...got me to the edge of my seat.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="pretty crazy movie"></head><body><p>Around this team every year for Halloween, I enjoy watching some horror movies. Sure most of them might be horrible, but every once in a while you run accross a good one. I enjoyed Saw, Gothika, heck I even liked the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre. But, the really good horror movie that you should watch this Halloween is Identity which I ind to be one of the best. I decided to watch this and it was better than the horrible Amityville Horror. I do have to admit that it was better than most American horror flicks. But that really isn't saying too much. I have no idea about how good the dubbing is because I watched it in its original language because I'm half french. The acting seemed fie though. The music was good but what kept it together was the very solid cinematography.<br />You could basically describe this movie by saying this: Saw times 10. I watched Saw and I don't have a weak stomach but Saw is Barbie compared to this splatter fest. The director here went WAY overboard. There must have been 500 bucks spent on tomato sauce. Every seen, there was something. For example, the psychopath takes a desk and crushes a mans head with it. It was sick. He jsut ran it over. He had his little rasor and cut everyone up and made me disgusted. I mean he even blew away the little toddler. No joke! Noe that's overboard. But let me tell you, this movie had nonstop violence and gore and is even a toughy for people with strong stomachs. Just to warn you, the violence involves: a desk, rasor, axe, chainsaw, shotgun and even barbed wire (yuk!). [...]<br /><br />Yet, I still was very interested by it and even compelled at times. This would end out being a descent horror rental with way too much gore. But, the ending screwed it over. The ending, I kid you not ruined the entire movie for me. The ending's absurdity shows how this foreign director tried to use twists like every American director. But this is completely out of context and makes the movfie crap. I'd ignore this trashy movie not worth anything. It had some good scenes that were wrapped up in 8 tons of gore and were then smuthered in plot twists that really ruined this and unlike the solid movie, Saw, stayed as just another horror flick much like the Amityville Horror and the rest of them. This movie borrowed elements from litterally every other movie and did a fair job but ended out NOT BEING SCARY WHATSOEVER but instead being disgusting. So, if I were you, ignore this horror movie and instead check out horror movies like these:Identity, Secret Window, Gothika, Halloween, The Shining, Stir of Echoes, The Silence of the Lambs, Seven, etc..<br /><br />SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />For all of you that saw this movie, please read this.<br />The ending was horrible hands down and made no sense. Where did this truck come from then? Marie came with her friend in a car not in a van! The ending is horrid and just makes no sense. And the whole lesbian stuff, is that a joke? What?! Wow!</p></body></html>

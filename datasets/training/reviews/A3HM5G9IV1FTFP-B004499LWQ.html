Labute's ("In The Company of Men", "Your Friends and Neighbors") films are populated by sadists, sociopaths, and disconnected doormats. The characteres in "Closer", although far from admirable, are, for the most part, fairly ordinary and easy to relate to. Which, in my opinion, makes their behavior all the more captivating and unsettling.<br /><br />The film begins when obituary writer Dan (Jude Law) meets and falls for stripper Alice (Natalie Portman). What starts out as a tender romance gets complicated when Dan gets his picture taken for his novel (ironally based on Alice's life) and feels an instant attraction to photographer Anna (Julia Roberts). Although attracted, Anna resists his advances at first, and ends up involved with dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen), who Dan inadvertantly introduces Anna to. However, after a while, Anna gives into her feelings for Dan, and the result is that the four characters end up in a subtle yet dirty power struggle to preserve their relationships and pride.<br /><br />Filled with scathing, sharp dialogue, and intense, difficult emotional exchanges, "Closer" explores the mix of tenderness, attraction, jealousy, power, competition and need that make up modern romantic and sexual relationships. Mike Nichols' direction is seamless, letting his four talented (and beautiful) leads flesh out their characters wonderfully. Natalie Portman is particularly excellent (her strip-club powerplay scene with Clive Owen is my favorite scene in the film) avoiding all the cliches and creating a character who is both innocent and jaded, manipulative and naive. "Closer" may be my favorite film of the year. Bravo.</p></body></html>

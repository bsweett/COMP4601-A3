<meta name="summary" content="Let's have a part three!"></head><body><p>Although I liked Pitch Black more because of its darker nature, Chronicles of Riddick is absolutely an entertaining movie to watch. It is a little disturbing that the character of Riddick was changed into somekind of SF Chuck Norris, but still the movie holds together very well as the special effects and the costumes look impressive. If they could find a director that is able to return to the atmoshere of Pitch Black, I even think there could be a succesfull part three. (SARR)</p></body></html>

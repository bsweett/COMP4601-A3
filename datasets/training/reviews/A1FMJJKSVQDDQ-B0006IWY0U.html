<meta name="summary" content="Ship vs. Ship"></head><body><p>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is one of those films that had me hooked from beginning to end. This isn't your typical Hollywood-style action-adventure. It's a very elaborate and very realistic "historical" film with tremendous details on costumes, art direction, and cinematography. The action scenes are spectacular, no slow-motion fights or unnecessary over-the-top music whatsoever. Performances from the entire cast are superb (jobs well done for Crowe, Bettany, Woodall, Boyd, etc.). The dialogue is solid gold, while the pacing of the film is just right. The baroque music is enjoyable, and the sound effects are first-rate. This is good stuff right here. I can easily recommend it to those who love swashbuckling adventures, historical epics, and human drama.<br /><br />Grade: 9.2/10</p></body></html>

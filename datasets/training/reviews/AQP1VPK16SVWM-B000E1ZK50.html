I don't know what I expected certainly something different than this campy popcorn movie. That was probably part of the problem. "Van Helsing", like "The Fearless Vampire Killers", packages camp, classic horror, satire and action all into one seamless package. Is it the worst film of the world? Well, yes if you were expecting enlightenment or something deep and meaningful. But if you were expecting adventure, humor and a startling mix of traditional special effects and CGI to support some truly looney and over-the-top performances, you'll have a blast with "Van Helsing".<br /><br />Abraham Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a man with no memory. Working for the Vatican to rub out evil throughout the world, he faces his most difficult task--facing Dracula who has been supporting Dr. Frankenstein's research into creating life for his own nefarious reasons. Van Helsing also has to save the souls of the family that has been fighting Dracula for centuries. Anna the latest in a long line of vampire killers is in danger and Van Helsing is directed to help her. Playing Q to Van Helsing's James Bond is Carl a Friar who comes up with all the wonderful toys Van Helsing must use to dispatch evil.<br /><br />Stephen Sommers' monster hit movie was completely misinterpreted by most critics and, yes, by lots of moviegoers. It's not a perfect movie but it's perfectly entertaining. There's always going to be mindless fun movies created for the 12 year old in all of us. Sommers' movie is an attempt to recreate that feeling (which he, no doubt, had as a kid as well) for adult movie audiences as well as kids.<br /><br />The quality of the DVD varies a bit. While the colors are vivid throughout most of the movie, the beginning of the film looks particularly soft with a lack of sharp detail. It does improve, however, as the movie progresses. My guess is that it's due both to the transfer and the large amount of detail in the images as well as the compression. Some of the sequences are startling clear and are among the best I've seen on DVD. The sound has tremendous presence. Sommers and Ducsay his producer/editor provide a delightfully informative audio commentary as do three of the main actors from the film Richard Roxburgh, Shuler Hensley and Will Kemp.<br /><br />The big difference between the two region one editons as simple--1 extra disc. Both editions have outtakes, "You Are in the Movie" (which tries to create the impression that you're part of the production crew on the set), "360 Degree Tour of Dracula's Castle", "The Legend of Van Helsing" (which discusses the character as portrayed through films), the first level of the "Van Helsing" Xbox game (which can be played on your DVD player) and the "Bringing the Monsters to Life" featurette.<br /><br />The extra disc has a number of features not included on the disc disc set. An interactive map, "Darkness Falls: Dracula's Lair is Transformed" which looks at the production end, a short documentary "Van Helsing: The Story, The Life and The Legend". Most importantly for old horror movie fans is the inclusion of three classic Universal horror movies Todd Browning's "Dracula"(1931), James Whale's "Frankenstein" (1931) and George Waggner's "The Wolf Man" (1940). "Dracula" is essentially the same as the first disc in the "Legacy" series with commentary, trailers and a short documentary. "Frankenstein" and "The Wolf Man" arrive bare bones with just the feature films.<br /><br />The big question will be whether or not the deluxe edition will be worth it? Only if you don't have the three Universal classics included. The featurettes and extras on disc three aren't all that impressive overall considering the price. If you don't have the three classic films and only want those (vs. ponying up for the "Legacy" boxed sets), then this would be the way to go. It's a pity that this editon doesn't have a "Director's Cut" (if one exists) along with Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale's commentary on the film.<br /><br />Overall, "Van Helsing" is a great movie to watch on Halloween (and there's only one minor bad word that I recall hearing and it's pretty minor)with kids 6 and older. It's a way to revisit the classics you grew up enjoying without having your kids get bored watching old black and white movies that with pacing from another era.</p></body></html>

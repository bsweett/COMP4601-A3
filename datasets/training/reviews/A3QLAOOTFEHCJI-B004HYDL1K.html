<meta name="summary" content="A fun "grindhouse" film"></head><body><p>Director Robert Rodriguez takes another stab and what has become a successful run of "grindhouse" films.  This move was initially shown as a trailer between "Death Proof" and "Planet Terror" when they appeared as a double feature a few years ago.  This is a brilliant idea as Rodriguez finds "A" list actors who elevate the style of the movie.  Granted this is stupid, dark and over-the-top violent but the movie doesn't take itself too seriously.  I had a lot of fun and certainly enjoyed seeing Lindsay Lohan in new light!</p></body></html>

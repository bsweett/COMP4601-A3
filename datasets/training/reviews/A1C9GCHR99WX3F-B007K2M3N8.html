<meta name="summary" content="Now Kevin Spacey as Bobby Darrin"></head><body><p>The last movie I reviewed, had Jamie Foxx playing Ray Charles, and this time Kevin Spacey plays the late Bobby Darrin, exepct for this time, Darrin has been dead for 3 decades before a movie is made about is life. A lot you may regonzie or not, that Bobby Darrin was born with a bad heart, and passed away on December 20th, 1973. This film version is just barely 2 hours long, and that is a good running time for a film, expect for some tv companies will end this down to at least 90 minutes, to show it in 2 hours, the ones that show movies with commerical breaks. But we have at least a few years before we have to worry about that. And I am sure that you heard, that Kevin Spacey re-recored all of Bobby's hits like Mack the Knife, Splish Slash, and the title tune at London's Abby Studios, now I am wondering why he chose to record them at Abby Studios since he or Bobby Darrin was not from London. When the film begins, Bobby Darrin (Kevin Spacey) is directing a movie about his life, but a then calls out cut, he is so un-happy at this session, that he walks over the soundstage, and is followed by his manger Steve Blauner (John Goodman) and brother-in-law (Bob Hoskins), and who is spots his the youngster (William Ullrich) that is playing him a child, and gives him his life story, of that he was born with a bad heart, and was precited to pass away before the age of 15, and to everyone's surpise makes it pass it. Some of the other parts to this story has him metting his wife Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth) on the set of Come Septemember, and they get married, even through she is younger then she really is, earlier this year the real Sandra Dee passed away, she and Bobby Darrin was married from 1960-1967, and I am sure that plenty of Bobby Darrin fans loved to seen Kevin Spacey in this film playing their hero, and Spacey also sings Bobby Darrin's tunes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="dubbing is abominable"></head><body><p>This old scare flick is simply not scarry these days. The version I saw was not subtitled<br />and the dubbing was awful--both in Italian as well as English. Sound was uneven.<br /><br />Italian filmmakers seem to think this is acceptable. Well, guess what, folks? It's a headache for the<br />viewer.<br />The writing is as unimpressive as the direction. Argento has done much better elsewhere. Take a look<br />at that thing he did with Keitel. Harvey is terrific in it--and so is the film (with the exception of the uncalled for, nutty flashback sequence.)<br />Sorry, can't think of the title. Might be called The Black Cat. Not sure. Harvey plays a photographer in it.</p></body></html>

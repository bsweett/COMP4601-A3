<meta name="summary" content="Okay, I Will Admit: This Film Is Very Funny!"></head><body><p>A few months ago, I wrote a negative review for "Monty Python and The Holy Grail" that no one seemed to like. Well, today in school, we watched it in music class (didn't really understand the connection, unless it had something to do with "Spamalot"), and my opinion has now changed.<br /><br />I still have yet to watch the whole thing, but watching the film for the second time, I have now realized I was blind. I know understand a lot of the humor in it. This film is indeed screamingly funny. The opening credits? Hilarious! The coconuts? Inspired! The witch burning? Amazing! The Black Night? Classic! The Nights Who Say Ni? Great! This film may not be the funniest movie ever, but it's pretty close. It's in the Top 10.<br /><br />The extras add to a very funny movie. The commentary is funny, and the other extras are very enlightening. This is a film that I would recommend to only fans of certain humour, no "Saturday Night Live" or "South Park" humor. Still, this is a very funny movie.</p></body></html>

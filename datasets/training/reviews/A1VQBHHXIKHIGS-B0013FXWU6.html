<meta name="summary" content="Even better than my superlatives will make it seem"></head><body><p>This adaptation of OIL! by Upton Sinclair is so stunning that I'll forgive the author for his exclamation point.  158 minutes, and Sinclair's one of those respected writers we've all heard about without ever reading.  I am guilty.  And the movie weighs in at 158 minutes, so I expected boring but watchable.  Nope.  I was blown away.  Over already?  Damn.<br /><br />It makes me want to read the guy's work, and to learn more about the screenwriter responsible for such a powerful adaptation of the novel.<br /><br />Finally, I'd call this the greatest performance of Daniel Day-Lewis's career, and yes I have seen him in other movies.<br /><br />This movie, quite simply, does everything right.</p></body></html>

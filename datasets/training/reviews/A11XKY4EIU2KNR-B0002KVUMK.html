<meta name="summary" content="Decent, but not one of my favorites"></head><body><p>This movie is what it is. My favorite charactors were Dracula's Brides.<br /><br />I know CGI is here to stay, but good Lord could we tone it down just a bit? I miss the good old days with stop motion action and people in costumes. The CGI looks just as fake as Stop Motion Puppets, but with CGI you feel like you're watching a video game instead of a film.<br /><br />Some people will like this, some won't. It's one of those movies you really have to see for yourself because everyone has an opinion on it.</p></body></html>

He is a jackal addicted to this process... This is an elevated state of being an intensely eager predator pursuing his prey until he gets him down... As strange as it is, as scary as that world is, Lt. Hanna has a social conscience... He has a normal spectrum of human feelings... He's very authentic in how he loves his life...<br /><br />The fusion of Robert De Niro and Neil McCauley is so total... He's committed to the rigidity of that perspective and it's a heartbreaking role... It's a tragic character... In his world, what he's doing, he feels justified in doing it... McCauley has a quiet look at a thief who has a certain kind of lonely disregard for who he kills but yet somehow you're in touch with his humanity... We can identify him when all that robbery turns out badly and when his lover Eady (Amy Brenneman) tries to escape from him... Brenneman's part was the hope that De Niro's character could have of escape, and love, and forgiveness... There's something so sad about these people and so poignant... They are so lost, and they want to be found so badly...It's like a huge opera... On one level, the film deals with a crime saga, on the other, with the interpersonal relationships that are woven all these characters...In the Pacino character and in the De Niro character you're basically seeing two sides of the same tough man...</p></body></html>

Absolutely *exciting* the entire time- that's the best way to describe my honest feelings.<br /><br />The storyline is just terrific and done in a way that's neither confusing or overbearing.  It's about a man and his girlfriend (or wife, I forget) who are both scientists, and they spend quite a bit of time experimenting and creating creatures in their lab that are part human and part... something else.  As you can guess, this is totally illegal, so they have to constantly keep a low profile and hide their results during inspections and other times.<br /><br />Well the results are that the creatures that form are anything but normal (without spoiling too much for you, my loyal readers, hehe).<br /><br />What makes Splice a little different from most movies that fall in the same category is that you get to witness the creature start out as just a baby and watch it grow and develop with every new scene.  If you find these kind of films interesting, you will no doubt be sitting there and constantly guessing just what *will* the creature do next.  There's no telling.<br /><br />The man and woman play the role of parenting the adorable creature (yes I admit, it WAS adorable).  They soon discover that it's female.  At first the thing jumps around all over the room making the man and woman VERY nervous that it might need to be put down immediately, but after some heavy convincing on the part of the girlfriend, the creature lives on.<br /><br />I absolutely love the way the storyline rolls along.  Excellent writing because it keeps you wanting to know more.  You get to experience the creature go from a baby, to a teenager, and finally to an adult.  When it finally does become an adult (which happens extremely quickly, might I add) *this* is when things get interesting (and no, I won't be spoiling any key moments of storytelling- sorry!).<br /><br />So no, this is most certainly NOT a storyline about some chaotic monster experiment that eventually takes out the entire world- this particular movie is about a creature that sticks around a distinct group of people that it seems to refers to as family, and it's really appealing to witness the creature try to communicate with the man and woman throughout the film, and how much information it's capable of absorbing and understanding.<br /><br />One outstanding scene is when a presentation takes place inside an auditorium showing two baby creatures and their potential, and while locked inside the glass cage, something goes horribly wrong involving lots of blood and stabbing, resulting in everyone who attended the presentation to immediately take off running.  This scene was my favorite in the entire movie because the suspense was overwhelmingly superb.<br /><br />Overall, yes.  Splice does everything right.  It's entertaining, suspenseful, and while I initially didn't care for the acting in the beginning, it eventually won me over as well.  Just a great suspense (or sci fi- whichever one you feel more comfortable referring to it as).</p></body></html>

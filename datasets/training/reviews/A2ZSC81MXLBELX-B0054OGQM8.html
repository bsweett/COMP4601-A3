I've been a big fan of "Back to the Future" and was thrilled to recieve my DVD package.The films are a great transfer, they look and sound magnificent. The pictures are clear and sharp in the widescreen(anamorphic),with excellent color as well.As for myself, I barely noticed that the specs may have been off. If those are important to you, you may want to read some of the other reviews here. The sound in 5.1 Dolby Surround(English and French) is all encompassing.There's enough "extras" to keep you busy all weekend!(great excuse not to do anything else) Included you will find, "The Making Of.." in three parts, one on each disc, there's some great question answer sessions from students at USC film school with Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale(you can listen to this throughout the films if you choose). You can also opt for the feature length commentary, see deleted scenes(that may answer some questions for you), wonderfully funny outtakes and music videos by Huey Lewis and ZZ Top. There is much more more, each disc has it's own "special features" to peruse.There are captions in English and subtitles in Spanish as well. If all the info on the discs is not enough there's also a booklet with some production notes that comes with it. The overall package is one of the best I've ever seen. THIS is one where the "special features" are really appreciated.<br /><br />The "Back to the Future Trilogy" has everything that makes a film a classic. The stories have Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi, Romance,Thrills, and even some Western adventure. All of which will sweep you away to the past, the future,the present and back again. It's a story for the whole family to enjoy together.(There is some mild language and mild violence).The filming and special effects are incredible, and the score(Alan Silvestri) and soundtrack unforgettable.The story is one for the ages. For those who are new to the world here's a little background of the entire trilogy......<br /><br />Marty McFly, is a 17 yr old high school student, who comes from a long line of "slackers".His friend,Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd), an eccentric scientist has built a time machine, out of a DeLorean, and oops, Marty accidently takes a trip back to 1955 and runs into his own parents as high school students.He must find Doc as he is the only one who may be able to help Marty get "Back to the Future".The problem is that getting him back will take some time, and by running into his parents, he has messed with the "space-time continuim" and has threatened his very own existence.He must make things right before he can go back!<br /><br />In part 2, Marty must travel 30 years ahead this time, to straighten his life out, which has been complicated by his nemisis,Biff(Thomas E. Wilson).Once again he is beset with the problem of history being rewritten due to his interference.He and Doc must find the exact moment on the time line that made life different for all around them. They travel several times through time and with the great camera work we get to see future Marty and past Marty in the same shot...It is important though, that Past Marty and Future Marty never meet!You will aslo see Old Biff meet Young Biff which is an amazing scene!<br /><br />Then in part 3, travel back 100 years to the old west. Marty dons a spiffy cowboy outfit, and must go back and save Doc from disaster this time. The problem in this time era, is more than just the gunslingers, nothing's been invented yet to help them with parts they need to repair the time machine.  Will they ever get back? Will life ever be normal again. You'll have a great TIME finding out!<br /><br />Great acting including Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson, and Mary Steenburgen add to the greatness of these films and superb direction and attention to every detail by Robert Zemeckis makes this a heck of a ride for all! Check out all the details in every era, it's amazing, and each time you watch you'll discover some new little nuance, you may not have caught before!<br /><br />Have a little time on your hands?...This is a great package to add to your DVD collection....Have Fun....Laurie<br /><br />also recommended for more fun:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FOPPEW">Romancing the Stone / Jewel of the Nile</a><br /><br />more time travel stuff: for reading - IF I NEVER GET BACK.

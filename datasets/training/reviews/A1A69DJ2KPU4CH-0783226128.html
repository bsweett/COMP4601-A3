If for some strange reason you haven't, well there are 700 some odd reviews to read here that I'm sure go into great detail about the plot, so read theirs.  I'm just here to tell you that Pacino's performance is one of the best committed to cinema ever.  This film could have easily been just another drug and gangsters movie had it not been Pacino in the lead roll.  His portrayal of Tony Montana is electrifying.  The supporting actors are fantastic in their own right, but Pacino is the reason to watch this remake.<br /><br />I saw this movie opening day in New York city back in 1983 and the entire theater cheered during key moments in the film.  It was quite an experience then, and it's still an experience now.  The Platinum Edition is the way to go.  I don't give five stars lightly, as to me five stars means perfect.  I think many reviewers on Amazon give out five stars like they're giving candy to Halloween trick or treaters.  It is very rare a film I would give a five star review, but if any film is worthy of that rating it's Scarface.</p></body></html>

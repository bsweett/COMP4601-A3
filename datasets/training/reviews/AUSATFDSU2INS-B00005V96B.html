<meta name="summary" content="Scares that make you laugh"></head><body><p>It's nighttime. Your mom gives you a good night kiss and closes the door. Quietly you try to sleep when suddenly you feel a creak in the door. The closet opens and a monster comes out to steal you a scream<br /><br />.<br /><br />For you it's a nightmare. To the monster it's a way to produce some energy. And that's the premise of Monsters Inc.<br /><br />The Monster City is located at the other side of the closet. Diverse and weird creatures wander on the streets in their daily routines, most of them without interacting with the humans. A particular company, Monsters Inc., transforms children's nighttime screams in energetic resources to keep the city working properly.<br /><br />Monsters Inc staff is trained to scare, and no one is better than James Sullivan "Sully" (John Goodman), who alongside Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal, a riot) is the best team of energy collectors in the company<br /><br />Monsters must avoid contact with the children, because they think children are contagious (genius premise); neither can allow them to go to the monster world, since they can't predict what horrible consequences would follow.<br /><br />And exactly that's what happens. A little girl goes through the door and sends Mike and Sully in an unprecedented adventure.<br /><br />Filled with honest laughs, warm and funny, Monsters is a charming movie with a story as original as their predecessor, Toy Story and A Bug's Life.<br /><br />In this adventure, Pixar once again pushes the excellence level in animated movies, using 2.5 million render marks, compared with the 1.1 used in Toy Story. Such accomplishments are obvious and admirable, especially in sequences where you can see clearly the blue skin of Sully in movement with the air, Boo's hair or the wonderful facial expressions of Mike.<br /><br />This is a happy movie, full of joy and a good lesson. Fear creates power, but a negative one, which inhibits people (and monsters). But, as our character discovers, there are other kinds of power, much stronger, like a good laugh, to deal with our "inner demons" and come out winners in life.<br /><br />Now about the DVD, I have to say that comes with great extras and bonus.</p></body></html>

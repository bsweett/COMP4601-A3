<meta name="summary" content="Going Home..."></head><body><p>After watching the latest instalment of the Rambo series - which is very good stuff indeed in its uniquely brutal, bleak, carnage-obsessed way - I have decided that we need to airdrop Sylvester Stallone into Zimbabwe with a photo of Robert Mugabe and a .50 calibre heavy machine gun. Yes, I really do like the 'Rambo' films. This is not some ironic, "weren't the eighties great" nostalgia of the type you're seeing pimped all over mainstream broadcast media at the minute. They're great action films with some of the best musical scoring of the last thirty years which were massively influential, and, if we're honest, the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004Z33EG">First Blood</a>  is 'the' populist mainstream film that really brought the debate concerning the shameful treatment of returning Vietnam veterans into the public consciousness. I'll take them over the likes of 'The Matrix' et al any day of the week. I also don't buy into the "they were Reaganite propaganda" argument. While they may have been a favourite of Teflon Ron's during the eighties, it doesn't hold water if you watch them. True, the Soviets are the enemy 'du jour' in parts two and three, but its hardly as if the American political administration comes across as any better in either of the films. Watch the opening sequences of 'First Blood' again and tell me that Brian Dennehy's agent provocateur sheriff with his "we don't want long-haired drifters in our town" wouldn't have been a dyed in the wool Republican; watch the closing soliloquy in the police station and tell me that it is in any way pro-war. Then watch the latest instalment of the series and tell me that any jingoistic war-monger of a president could use it as a military recruiting tool.</p></body></html>

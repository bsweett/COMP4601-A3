<meta name="summary" content="Good movie, not many extras"></head><body><p>The unrated version of this movie only has an additional three minutes of footage, but it actually seems to have even less than that. There were basically just little segments throughout the movie that were extended by a few seconds, just to add that little bit more blood and gore. Didn't really add anything, nor did it take anything away. The extras consist of a couple commentary tracks, lame making of featurette, trailers, web links, etc. Not a lot, but my standards seem to be getting higher. The movie itself is a good sci-fi horror flick. I particularly love the opening sequence when the ship crashed on the planet. Those special effects were awesome. If you haven't seen this movie, I would rent the dvd before you buy it, just to make sure you like it, but if you like sci-fi this is a good film to add to your collection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Greed, Deception, and An Odd Ending -"></head><body><p>This movie did not appeal to me.  It is a overly long epic on a greedy, crazy, deceptive man, Daniel Plainview (played by Daniel Day Lewis).  The movie is based on the 1927 Sinclair novel Oil!  It begins in 1902 showing Plainview as a mineral and silver prospector in the Southwest.  The first 30 minutes drag on as there is little dialogue. After one of his workers dies in an accident, Plainview adopts the man's orphaned son.  We find out later the mother also died in childbirth.  He names the boy H.W. (Dillon Freasier) and uses him to establish himself as a family man and set a good image.<br /><br />Several years later, 1911, Plainview meets Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) who comes to his office with a proposal.  He knows of an oil deposit under his family's property in Little Boston, California and will let Plainview in on the secret for $500.  Plainview agrees travels out with H.W. asking to camp and quail hunt with his son.  After dinner with the Sunday family one evening he asks to buy the land at $3,700, which he feels is a good deal.  Paul's twin brother Eli (also played by Paul Dano) understands Plainview's deceptive offer and holds out for $10,000.  He wants part of his father's money to found a church.  Finally Plainview agrees and oil producton on the Sunday land begins.<br /><br />Eli asks Plainview to bless the oil well at the dedication.  Plainview, for some reason feels this is a power-play, and grabs Mary Sunday (a family member who does not like to pray) and dedicates the well holding her hand.<br /><br />Soon an on-site accident kills a worker, deafens his adopted son, and also catches the rig on fire.  You wonder if Eli should have blessed the well.<br /><br />Later a visitor (Kevin J. O'Connor) comes to Plainview's home saying he is his half brother and needs work.  Plainview takes him in, and H.W. discovers flaws in his story an attempts to kill him by setting his bed alight.  Plainview is upset at his boy's behavior and sends him to a school in northern California.<br /><br />The movie then goes into deals and offers with Union and Standard oil, a murder, deals and insults from Eli.  Later, in 1927, H.W. (Russell Harvards) finishes school and marries his childhood sweetheartr Mary Sunday (Colleen Foy).  His father, Daniel Plainview lives in a mansion alone.  He is obsessed with business and alcohol.  H.W. (through a sign language interpreter) to let him establish his own business.  This means disolving their partnership.  Plainview makes fun of his son's deafness and tells him of his origins and that he was adopted.<br /><br />Later, Eli visits Plainview, now head of a larger church and a religious radio show.  He needs money and goes to Plainview.  The odd ending shows that Plainview wants Eli to confess he is a false profit and God is a superstition. Eli finally does so after much humiliation.  The setting is the mansions bowling alley.  More anger and dialogue about land and oil ensue between Eli and Plainview, then Plainview uses an oversized straw to drink Eli's milkshake from across the room.  Then an angry Plainview chases Eli around the room with a bowling pin beating  him to death with it.  The only servant in the house comes down to see what is going on.  Plainview says "I'm finished" and the film ends.<br /><br />So the film bores, shows the worst of capitalism, greed and deception, and the ending is bizarre.  Daniel Day Lewis does a fine acting job, but the insane greedy character was not worth watching despite all the awards he and the movie received.</p></body></html>

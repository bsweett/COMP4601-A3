<meta name="summary" content="Sadly, the worst Trek"></head><body><p>I am a bigtime Trek fan, so bear with me. I've seen every TNG episode multiple times, and the final TV episode ranks up their with the best television I've ever seen.<p>But this film, despite moments of excellence, is a turkey. I rented the DVD, and was so peeved at various parts, including, in particular, the ludicrous (and unfaithful to longtime viewers) ending, that I immediately rewatched several extremely annoying scenes with the director's commentary with my wife. Our mutual thought: What were they thinking?<p>Fans have invested a lot into these characters, and it would not be a bad trek move to kill them off -- if it meant something. This end was so lame that it had us wondering &quot;he died for that?!&quot; It was as if a garden-variety blown fuse had electrocuted Geordi. And, it invalidates the final TV episode (Arggh!).<p>The movie does get two stars, only because the basic plot itself is simply brilliant -- that a clone of Picard, with a far different childhood -- turns into a monster capable of ultimate evil. It could have been high concept Hollywood at its best. The actor who plays Picard's clone gives a fascinating, poignant and very cool performance that nearly rescues this wreck of a movie. Picard, as always, is superb, but he's stuck with C-grade lines too much of the time. All of the other characters are in some sort of fog, including Data. Many of the named cast (Dr. Crusher, anyone), are nearly written out of the script. And, in the worst Trek tradition, the cheese factor on some of the special effects and fight scenes is simply Velveeta. The scenes on Romulus include laughably bad sets...<p>Bottom line: There is a reason why this Trek is so cheap on DVD and the TV episodes so pricey. Go buy &quot;All good things...&quot; on DVD, and revisit the magic that has so tragically gone out of this series that had been so dear to me, and let this turkey lie.</p></body></html>

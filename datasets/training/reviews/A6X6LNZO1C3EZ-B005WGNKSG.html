That's more than most DVD's get."></head><body><p>Based upon a book by Stieg Larsson, this sub-titled foreign movie sets up characters clumsily, but enough substance is there to get on board.  Eventually some old corporate owner wants to hire an investigator to find out what happened 40 years ago to his niece.  The movie gets clumsy again and sets up more characters; relatives of the old corporate owner as suspects in the assumed murder of that niece.  From out of nowhere comes a Goth culture early twenties gal, computer hacking her way along a trail of espionage that ultimately places her and the hired investigator together.  The brutality of what the early twenties gal has for an environment includes a corrupt parole officer that makes the viewing audience involved emotionally as she takes revenge (with years of personal abuse and exploitation venting) upon the corrupt parole officer.  I'm not sure if that was to get me to say "Hurrah" or be disgusted at watching somebody lower themselves to the same level just to punish a brute.  It is a bit over done in my opinion, which was no doubt fully intended by the producer and director of this film, and it leaves you hanging for a bit.  There is more sickening and grotesque footage coming, and sadistic, masochistic and otherwise dysfunctional practices come to the screen in enough detail to make the viewer nearly ready to push the eject button on the remote, except for wanting to know if the guilty perpetrator is brought to justice; so the DVD spins on.  There is some wonderful sharing of consensual emotional and physical recreation between the Goth culture young woman and the hired investigator, but by the time the movie gets around to it, this 2-1/2 hour long film has exhausted the viewer mentally and emotionally enough that the roller coaster ride doesn't really seem fun that late in the drama; like it otherwise would.  Noomi Rapace is the Goth culture young woman that I would really like to see in a less dark film, or one that isn't as believable into investigating contemporary crime.  Let's say, maybe she could star in a Sci-Fi/Fantasy feature of ancient Vikings, or knights from the Dark Ages or Renaissance, or futuristic space travel adventures on other planets.  Then put the Goth woman's recreation scene into that format without the horrific, torturous, gruesome crimes against women intended to portray real life possibilities.  Then this actress might get the attention she deserves as an entertainer.  I liked the story well enough, but obviously I'm not into gender crimes against women, and think I'd rather watch a documentary on war and crimes against humanity in general, than become witness vicariously (via DVD) to the misogyny of this film.<br />I watched the movie trailer, and read several reviews, also taking into account the publicity given this film by the recent death of the Swedish author of the book this movie is based upon; and like driving by a fatality traffic accident scene being worked by police and emergency rescue workers - I couldn't look away.  If I got anything out of this movie, it is the concrete reassurance that I don't like movies about crimes against women.  But I will have to admit, this movie delivers everything you anticipate it should - which is why I gave it a 3 star rating.</p></body></html>

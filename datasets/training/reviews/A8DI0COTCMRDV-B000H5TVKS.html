You can officially add 'SAW II' to the short line of excellent horror movie sequel's such as 'Halloween 2''Friday the 13th part 2''Evil Dead 2''Aliens' & ofcourse the more recent 'The Devil's Rejects' While not quite the masterpiece that part 1 is,it's pretty damn close & yes there is plenty of blood. The very beginning of this flick is disturbingly great!</p></body></html>

It was re-released in the mid-1980s, and, no doubt, many of us Generation Yers, as well as people who were children when it was first released, a good thirty decades before, will recall just how beautiful a film it truly is.  For starters, the use of color to tell this oft-told tale, with great attention to detail.  Particularly, I recall the scenes that take place in the forest, when the beautiful Princess Aurora, who carries a curse on her head, bestowed on her by the evil and vindictive Malificent, is hiding away with her fairy godmothers, Flora, Fauna and Merriweather.  It's so green in these sequences that I can almost smell the earth.  What's more, Princess Aurora is drop-dead gorgeous.  It's easy to see why the jealous Malificent cursed the blonde-haired beauty at her christening.  [Yes, though most of you probably know about the plot already, for those of you who aren't familiar with it.  Aurora's curse is that, before sunset on her sixteenth birthday, she will fatally prick her finger on a spindle.]  What's more, the music is just beautiful.  For those of you familiar with the original score, by Tchaikovsky, you won't be disappointed.</p></body></html>

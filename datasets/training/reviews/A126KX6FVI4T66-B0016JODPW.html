<meta name="summary" content="social decay and cannibalism"></head><body><p>I have no trouble with the acting in this movie,<br />but the theme is just really nasty.<br />Members of a family that is decaying before<br />your eyes make this a very hard movie to watch.<br />There is also the explicit sex and violence<br />that starts and ends the movie.<br />All the flashbacks and seeing the action from different points of view just make it worse. For the subject matter the script is well<br />written as well and the cast, setting and<br />everything else is well done.<br />The movie just sucks as a subject...</p></body></html>

Just watched the directors cut...and now I'm a believer. Second time around I had an idea of what this deal was about..and it made all the difference. I like entering a "different world" in a film, and this one does a very convincing job. Some magnificent sets, with moody lighting. Good actors, intriguing story. Looking forward to another re-watch in the future.</p></body></html>

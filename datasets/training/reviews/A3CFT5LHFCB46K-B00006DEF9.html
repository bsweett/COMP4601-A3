With so much happiness, it is impossible not to like this movie. Unless you have a problem with feeling good, you should see this movie. <p>The cast is dynamic. Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds all show real enthusiasm as though they want to star in the movie, not "I was forced to by my contract" or "I did it for the money". Despite the fact it runs at less than two hours, this movie packs more excitement and great music than most dull, three-hour musicals combined. With enormous laughs (The biggest provided by O'Conner and Jean Hagen), great dialogue ("Why, I make more money than - than - than Calvin Coolidge, put together!") and fourteen wonderful songs including "Fit as a Fiddle", "Beautiful Girl", "You Were Meant for Me" "Make Em' Laugh" and "Good Morning". But the one everyone remembers the most is the title song, sung as Gene Kelly dances, twirls and, of course, sings in a storm (Stanley Kubrick later used the song in a less flattering way, but that's another story). I have also seen few movies take such beautiful and generous use of Technicolor. <p>As many fans should know, this gem turns fifty this year. Perhaps Warners (Or whoever owns the rights) should celebrate this golden anniversary by putting out a special edition DVD. Better yet, I would love to see this projected on the big screen. If you're listening out there, don't hesitate. Many others are waiting like I am.</p></body></html>

If they're not, right about now, there's a chance that they're spinning around in their caskets. But if they're still with us, they're probably furiously digging a grave for Seth Rogen, a disrespectful gent what just torpedoed the Green Hornet franchise. If you're a fan of the 1960s television series with Van Williams and Bruce Lee - or even if you're a fan of the 1940 serial with Gordon Jones - this new adaptation may find you grinding your teeth. Of course, you may have the same reaction even if you're not familiar with the Green Hornet.<br /><br />Some things change for the better, but this adaptation makes a case for entropy. Feckless playboy Britt Reid has just inherited his murdered father's crusading newspaper, the Daily Sentinel. Reid's alter ego, the Green Hornet, updated to these contemporary times, is still the scourge of the criminal underworld. He's still viewed as a villain by the police and the general public, which is all part of the plan as the Hornet had, from jump, meant to pose as a lawbreaker (and I actually find his reasoning for this logical as hell). This time, his purview is Los Angeles and his main villain an underworld crime boss who touts the hard-to-pronounce name of Chudnofsky. Chudnofsky, by the way, agonizes over his image, which he worries may not be intimidating enough. This becomes a running gag throughout the film and eventually results in Chudnofsky's assuming his own costumed persona, but a lame one. Behold Chudnofsky as he becomes... Bloodnofsky. Everyone must now cower.<br /><br />What were they thinking, the powers that be? That to properly revive a once popular pulp hero, it required a comedic swerve? Seth Rogen is absolutely wrong for the Green Hornet role. And since Rogen gets co-writing and co-producing creds here, much of what happens onscreen has to be laid at his feet. A touch of humor is always welcome and appreciated, but only so far as it services story and plot and even characterization. The Green Hornet ain't supposed to be frivolous and silly like the Mask. You couldn't tell that in this movie.<br /><br />Even more egregious than the off-putting comedic tone is Rogen's choice of how Britt Reid is portrayed. His Britt is abrasive and buffoonish, which I guess is okay to start with. But as the movie went on, Rogen doesn't do or say anything to redeem his character or make him more appealing. He starts out obnoxious and then treads water. And this Britt Reid, he's not even clever. No wonder he becomes envious of Kato.<br /><br />Speaking of, one of the film's few saving graces is Jay Chou as Kato, inventor extraordinaire, expert kung fu master, and Britt Reid's right hand man. Kato is clearly the brains in this operation, and this eventually becomes a source of tension between the two. There are some rough patches in which you can't make out what he's saying because of his thick accent, but Chou carries himself well. Kato's resourcefulness and his fight scenes are the film's highlights, although the one knock against his fight scenes is that there was this clear catering to 3D, and so we get those extraneous special effects.<br /><br />Some other saving graces? I thought the Hornet's Black Beauty - a sleek 1965 Chrysler Imperial - was awesome. And the gas gun. And, okay, I did appreciate the exploration into the hero-sidekick relationship, and the neat swerve of the sidekick being ridiculously more capable than the lead hero.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz comes in as the eye candy that drives a wedge between the Hornet and Kato. Tom Wilkinson and Edward James Olmos spend their time onscreen avoiding eye contact with their self-esteem. What does it say about the film when the best moment it offers may be when the Hornet and Kato are in their tricked-out ride singing along to 2Pac's "Gangsta's Paradise"? Or, wait, maybe the best scene is the one in which Britt Reid tries to come up with a code name for his new alter ego, and he arrives at "the Green Bee." Or maybe that's just wishful thinking. Because THE GREEN BEE may have fared better. It doesn't come with the baggage of nostalgic expectations. Somewhere, Nicolas Cage is still marveling over his good luck. He abandoned ship just in time.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff (which features Seth Rogen's incredibly annoying laugh): Audio Commentary by Seth Rogen & co-writer Evan Goldberg, director Michel Gondry, and producer Neil Moritz; the "Awesoom" gag reel (00:07:19 minutes long); "The Black Beauty: Rebirth of Cool" - a segment focusing on the Green Hornet and Kato's ride (00:07:19 minutes); and a segment in which co-writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg discuss their writing of THE GREEN HORNET (00:10:36).</p></body></html>

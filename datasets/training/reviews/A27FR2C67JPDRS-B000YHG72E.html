<meta name="summary" content="Make a Buddy for the holidays!"></head><body><p>Being a former cast member of Saturday Night Live doesn't guarantee a comedian a real chance of movie stardom.  For every Mike Myers, there is a Jimmy Fallon (attn:  Mr. Fallon---big mistake leaving SNL).  Fortunately Will Farrell is not one of those guys that will fall to the wayside.  He proves this with "Elf", a charming Christmas tale perfectly suited for him.<br /><br />  In this story a young baby accidently ends up in Santa's bag of toys and is taken back to the north pole.  The child is raised by one of the lead Elves (played by the wonderful Bob Newhart) until Buddy (Farrell) realizes he must find his real father.<br /><br />  The journey takes Buddy to New York where his work driven father (James Caan) finds out he has an adult soon and is, of course, convinced that his son, who believes he is an elf, is a complete nut case.  Will Farrell's innocent portrayal of Buddy is perfect and he makes the character lovable.  I hope this film finds its way into the list of Christmas classics that we see on TV every December during the holiday season.  It certainly deserves to be. I recommend this film for all---a funny movie to enjoy with family or friends.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Legendary Scarface"></head><body><p>*I recently saw Scarface when it was released into theatres to coincide with it's debut on Blu-Ray. If I am correct and this theatrical release is indicative of the Blu-Ray release, I can tell you that the film has never looked more stunning. The picture is crisp, clean, and really shows how beautifully shot the film is, as well as the unique use of color throughout.<br /><br />Scarface needs no introduction. Loosely inspired by a 1932 gangster-picture based on Al Capone, Scarface is a bonafide gangster-movie classic that has overshadowed its 1932 counterpart to the point of obscurity. A teacher I had in high school was once (poorly and inaccurately) discussing movies and asked the class "Scarface is based on a true story, right? Who is it based on?" A kid in the back of the class called out "Al Capone." The teacher laughed and in a mocking tone replied "It's not based on Al Capone!" There you have it; for many people, this is not only the definitive version of Scarface, but the only one that exists. The film developed a cult following after its 1983 theatrical release, but has outgrown that cult following and developed something much more substantial. As of 2011, the film has been widely embraced by mainstream audiences, film critics, filmmakers, and Hip-Hop musicians. It's been endlessly satirized, parodied, and referenced in popular culture and is considered a classic "gangster" picture, frequently mentioned alongside <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019L770A">The Godfather</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790729725">GoodFellas</a>. It also has one of the most legendary screen performances of all time with Al Pacino's performance as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee, who arrives in Miami, Florida with nothing but his balls and his word...and an insatiable thirst for power.<br /><br />Directed by Brian De Palma at the peak of his creativity and written by Oliver Stone, Scarface appeals to a wide range of demographics due to the collaborative creative genius of these two. De Palma had made a name for himself directing thrillers with strong artistic sensibilities, while Stone had yet to establish himself as he would later and his recent writing projects had been the acclaimed Midnight Express and, oddly enough, Conan the Barbarian. De Palma had a style that appealed greatly to film aficionados, but he also possessed a capacity for making films that were accessible and straight-forward enough for the mainstream, while Stone had dabbled in action films but possessed the intelligence, capability, and talent to do something more than his r&eacute;sum&eacute; suggested. Scarface is a film that has been subjected to long-winded analysis by esteemed film critics and has simply been labeled "badass" by the typical moviegoer. On the surface, it's just a gangster movie with plenty of cocaine, violence, and language but Stone managed to incorporate more complicated themes of lust, power, and determination into his straight-forward narrative. This film and the Tony Montana character represent something to people. His principles and extravagant lifestyle have made him an idol for those maintaining a "gangster" persona, but there's something deeper too. Perhaps it's because Tony essentially lives the drug-addled American Dream that people latch onto him so fiercely.<br /><br />Most people seem to agree that Scarface is a masterpiece, but I've always found it a tad overrated. In recent years, the term `overrated' has grown to mean "something that's supposed to be great, but is actually terrible." When I say Scarface is overrated, I mean that it's supposed to be great, but I've found that it just lingers on that line between `great' and `very good.' There are many scenes that rank as some of the best in cinematic history and so few bad scenes, but I have never latched onto the film in the way so many others have. The more I see it though, the more apparent things become. Most recently, I started to take notice of the score by Giorgio Moroder. It's synthesizer-driven, yet doesn't age the film as many musical scores from the 80s have. Would the opening credits of the film be so effectively ominous with any other music? Much of the music is as iconic as the film and suits the tone and setting perfectly.<br /><br />Many aspects of Scarface lend to the case that it's one of the greatest films ever made. This is one of the most quotable movies ever made certainly and the iconic dialogue (coupled with the delivery) still holds up after becoming so imbedded into the cultural vernacular. Most films are lucky if they have half as many great/memorable scenes as this one; the opening scene, the chainsaw scene, the helicopter scene, the bathtub scene, and, of course, the incredibly executed climax. De Palma's direction is straight-forward enough for mainstream viewers, but has enough of his artistic sensibility to give film enthusiasts something to admire. Then, there's the one-of-a-kind performance by Al Pacino which, make no mistake about it, is one of the great screen performances. As Tony Montana, Pacino is frightening, hilarious, psychotic, yet human, going completely over-the-top but never losing control. Few actors could make Tony such a layered character. It's a calculated performance that is utterly flamboyant and endlessly fascinating. The iconic status of Scarface is indebted to Pacino, who took a great risk playing this character this way and miraculously, flawlessly pulled it off. He's overacting certainly, but how else could this character exist? Even going over-the-top, Tony never seems disconnected from the world around him. Stone's dialogue is great on its own, but Pacino's declaration "All I have in this world is my balls and my word and I don't break them for no one" is the landmark dialogue it is because of the way it's delivered rather than written. "I kill a communist for fun, but for a green card, I gonna carve him up real nice." Calculated; even with the flamboyant accent, Pacino emphasizes every word just right for maximum effect. When Pacino is onscreen, the movie is his. It's impossible to take your eyes off of him and without him, Tony Montana would not exist in the capacity he does today. It's a performance that will still be talked about hundreds of years from now. His performance makes such a massive impression that the other acting contributions are frequently overlooked. While this is unquestionably Pacino's movie in every sense, as he overshadows everyone around him, the actors that inhabit this world do incredible work themselves, evident in how each and every character, big and small, are so memorable. There is not a weak performance to be found and if people could avert their eyes from Pacino for a moment, they'd rave about the ensemble. The cast sink into their characters so well that it's impossible to separate the character from the actor. How many times do you think people have seen Steven Bauer in later films and thought `its Manny!'<br /><br />Scarface is an imperfect film, but this critique may be based on viewer subjectivity rather than cinematic imperfection. Regardless, the perfections largely outnumber the imperfections, which are few but prominent. It's a little too `80s for its own good at times, especially in the obligatory, cheesy 80s montage that singlehandedly ages the movie more than anything else. Even with a running time of 170 minutes, Oliver Stone's script is very tightly structured. Stone even suggests Shakespearean themes amongst the chaos, but some scenes seem stretched too long. Perhaps Stone felt every scene in his script was necessary to illustrate the man Tony Montana is, but it seems that it could have been trimmed and had the same impact. De Palma's direction is near-perfect until it comes to handling Tony's incestuous inclinations towards his sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). This is an essential part of illustrating Tony Montana's psyche, but I have issues with the way De Palma handles it. It just seems so over the top and overemphasized. With the final scene between Tony and Gina, it may have been impossible, but I think De Palma could have made it more subtle rather than emphasizing Tony's feelings with ominous music and extreme close-ups.<br /><br />No matter what the subject matter, you need to be in a certain mood and frame of mind to embark on a 3-hour movie. My level of enjoyment watching Scarface has varied with each viewing due to extraneous circumstances. I'm in the minority in that I consider it a mild masterpiece, but wouldn't rank it as one of my favorite films. On this more recent viewing, I grew bored with it at times but this could be attributed more to a lack-of-sleep and a long day than an objective view of the quality of the film. While I enjoyed it less than before, my appreciation for it deepened dramatically and I may retract my steadfast affirmation that it's not a masterpiece when I watch it again someday. I greatly admire it, but I don't greatly enjoy it. In the meantime, I acknowledge that Scarface has lost none of its power with the curse of over-familiarity. Everyone has seen this film referenced or parodied at some point, yet this has not reflected on the finished product at all. Whether people's undying love for the film stems from what it is or what it represents is irrelevant; Scarface, in many ways, is a great film that has made an impact on both cinema and culture that can't be ignored.<br /><br />GRADE: B+</p></body></html>

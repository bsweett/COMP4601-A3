<meta name="summary" content="Brutally Realistic, But Not Without Hope"></head><body><p>This story of a young Columbian woman who agrees to become a mule to transport heroin into the U.S. is realistic, very linear and very affecting. Maria is a poor, independent-minded woman who has quit her job in the sweat-house flower growing industry and has learned she's pregnant. She agrees to become a mule, swallowing large capsules of compressed heroin and attempting to get past U.S. inspectors after a flight to New York. She's picked up by paid thugs who take her to a cheap safe house to wait until the capsules pass through her body. The whole process is shown realistically. The dangers are real, from capture by the authorities to death if one of the capsules ruptures inside the body. This happens to one of the women on the same flight with her, and the movie plays out the consequences to Maria. As demeaning and brutal as the process is shown to be, the movie ends on some small notes of hope.<br /><br />The acting is first rate. The actress who plays Maria had never acted before and does an outstanding job. The character she plays can be stubborn, not always honest, brave when she needs to be. This is an excellent movie well worth seeing.</p></body></html>

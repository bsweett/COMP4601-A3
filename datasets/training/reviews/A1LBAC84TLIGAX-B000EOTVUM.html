<meta name="summary" content="AN EXCELLENT INDEPENDENT FILM  9.5 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>Wolf Creek is a fantastic example of how you can do a lot with a little. This easily one of the best independent films I've ever seen and is easily one of the most terrific and well-executed horror films I've seen. While the film received mixed reviews from critics (Roger Ebert, you're a major ***hole) and moviegoers, if you give it a chance and you're not easily bored, Wolf Creek does impress.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Year: 1999. Three friends; Liz, Kristy, and Ben decide to go on a cross-country across Australia to go to Wolf Creek to see one of the world's biggest craters. When they get back to their station wagon, it won't start or even make noise. Just when they are about to spend the night there, a man named Mick just so happens to come along and offers them a tow to his place to fix their car. So the group goes along with the plan, but when they wake up the next morning they realize that are trapped with a vicious and dangerous serial killer in the middle of nowhere and try to find a way to escape. The problem is, like Mick said, you never know where he might pop up.<br />MUSIC: Music comes and goes at times, but it's still very good and provides for the tense atmosphere which this film does an excellent job of providing.<br />ACTION: This film starts off pretty slow, but when it gets going it doesn't stop. This film is very tense, very suspenseful, and is actually scary. This film does a great job of capturing the feeling of realism because this is fully capable of happening. The violence is pretty gruesome throughout the film as well. Thank God, a horror film that is actually scary.<br />ACTING: This area was generally good, but there were times in which the actors dropped the ball and they were cheesy. The dialogue was fairly believable, but it also ran into problems. It's pretty good overall and the actors make it seem real, that's the important thing.<br />OVERALL: If you're a person who is tired of the usual pointless crappy horror films, then Wolf Creek is a definite must-have. Wolf Creek is a fantastic independent horror film that is definitely worthy of a purchase. It's creepy, it's gruesome, and it feels realistic.<br />THE GOOD: The actors, the gore, the music, and the realism.<br />THE BAD: Moments of bad acting and dialogue, and it's slow in the beginning.</p></body></html>

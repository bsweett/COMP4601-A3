<meta name="summary" content=""Halloweenr", Zombie Remake All Trick No Treat"></head><body><p>As a die-hard fan of Carpenter's classic, I was incredibly dissapointed & angry at this lame, trashy remake.<br /><br />The problem with this "Halloween" is:<br /><br />1. Zombie needs to stop, & I mean stop, casting his films with entire casts from his previous films. The entire cast from "Devil's Rejects" is here & it was really annoying. He also needs to bring his films into the present. Enough with the white trash 70's.<br /><br />2. The film spends way, way too much time in Michael's youth. He kills his sister - we know this going into the picture, since we're versed in Carpenter's original. This makes the movie sag like William Forsythe's stomach. Putting a human face on Michael Myers was also a big mistake.<br /><br />In the original, the grown up Michael was known as "The Shape", for the simple reason being, is that behind that mask was the simple definition of pure evil incarnate. In Zombie's remake, basically, Myers turns out to be just another a-hole gone psychotic from a byproduct of white trash American society. Get him a job at the local post office & he would fit right in.<br /><br />3. The timeline in this film is totally f***ed. I can only assume that the beginning of this film starts on Halloween of 1978, since little Mikey is listening to "God Of Thunder", has a Kiss t-shirt on, & the entire atmosphere looks like, at least, poor whitetrash mid-seventies. So add 15 years to 1978 add at least 2 or 3 more for good measure & you still come up to 1995, 96 at best. Thats all well & good until Lynda tries to make a call on her cell phone, topless, in the Myers house.<br /><br />4. Tyler Mane as Michael Myers. I really had no problem with this until he first shows up in his cell in a bathrobe & slippers. Its gets worse as he turns around with an orange mask on his face that reminded me of the WWE's Kane. I was waiting for the Undertaker to show up for god's sake! "Rest in Peace"? You bet.<br /><br />5. Michael actually catches Laurie - & doesn't kill her. What!?!? That's like Wyle E. Coyote catching The Road Runner, turning to the audience, & saying, "What do I do now?"<br /><br />6. The score. Not here it isn't. Carpenter's haunting opening theme is used in Zombie's film 4 times at best & at all the wrong times. Zombie uses old school 70's tunes during different scenes. Not bad, but this is "Halloween" not "High School Musical".<br /><br />7. Its not scary. It's almost like watching an epiosde of A&E's "Cold Case File" or "American Justice". Zombie doesn't really set any tone or atmosphere for the film. Its just one set piece after another.<br /><br />8. The ending. Absolute bull***t.<br /><br />Stick with Carpenter's eternal classic, because next Halloween this remake will be forgotten, like last years autumn leaves</p></body></html>

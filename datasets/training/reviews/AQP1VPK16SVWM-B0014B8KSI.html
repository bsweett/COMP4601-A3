<meta name="summary" content="Michael: "You're a manic-depressive"  Arthur: "I am Shiva the god of death""></head><body><p>Michael Clayton (George Clooney nominated for an Oscar)fixes everything for everybody. If you're a client of his high power law firm and commit a hit & run or the firm's top lawyer Arthur Eden (Tom Wilkinson nominated for an Oscar)and drop your drawers during a deposition involving a multi-million dollar lawsuit over a pesticide, he's the janitor there to mop up the mess calming the client (Tilda Swindon)in that lawsuit. The problem is that Eden may have lost his marbles but he's crazy smart and there may be a reason for him to be concerned about the lawsuit.<br /><br />Clayton is burned out. The restaurant that he saw as his escape from the legal world went belly up and his life has taken more twists and turns than a roller coaster when all he wants is straight and smooth.<br /><br />A smart, well made legal drama "Michael Clayton" features a series of terrific performances. Director/writer Tony Gilroy ("The Bourne Supremacy" and the two sequels)tackles the subject with the skill worthy of a Sidney Lumet (who directed "The Verdict", "Network" and other classic films). Make no mistake this is NOT an action film like "The Bourne" series that Gilroy scripted but it has plenty of action in the drama.<br /><br />Both the Blu-ray and regular DVD editions of the film look extremely good capturing the look of the film's theatrical presentation. While the surround tracks are used with subtly adding ambience and an occasional kick when there is an explosion or a brief bit of action.<br /><br />The extras are a bit thin. Director/writer Gilroy and his brother editor John Gilroy provide an interesting commentary track covering everything from the inspiration for various characters to the choice to use deliberate pacing (reminiscent of Lumet's dramas) vs. a rapid cutting style and how the film builds tension by staying WITH the performers vs. cutting away.<br /><br />We also get deleted scenes with optional commentary by the Gilroys that features an entire subplot revealing the casual relationship between Clayton and one of the firm's other lawyers. I was a bit surprised that we didn't get featurettes on the production of the film but what we do get isn't the usual fluff.<br /><br />A smart, well made legal drama "Michael Clayton" features a series of terrific performances.

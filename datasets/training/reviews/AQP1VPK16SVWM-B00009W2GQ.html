<meta name="summary" content="You say you want a Revolution"></head><body><p>If Revolutions isn't what you expected, perhaps its time time to scale down your expectations. The film returns to its roots, sort of, by refocusing on the struggle between Zion and the machine world and Neo's role in bringing down The Matrix. Not everything is what it seems, though, in this complex, loud action thriller.<p>When we last saw Neo he was in a coma. Some of his abilities from the Matrix had intruded upon the real world. As a result, he was able to stop the squids from killing him and his crewmates. Evidently he's stuck between the machine world and the human one. He's stranded in a program that manifests itself as a subway station. His only way out is to get on the train that runs through it but the trainmaster is in the employ of the evil French character from the second film. That's not going to happen without some intervention from Trinity and Morpheus (which does eventually occur though to say how would spoil it).<p>Agent Smith has occupied the body of a human survivor of an attack by the Matrix. He's now able to battle Neo in the real world. He's also multipling in the Matrix taking over programs without end and reshaping the Matrix's interactive human landscape in the process. <p>The main weak point of the film is dividing up the trio of characters at the heart of the film; Trinity and Neo end up on a journey to Machine city where the ultimate confrontation may or may not occur. While Morpheus is shunted to the side as he tries to get back in time to help save Zion. The performances are, as usual, stellar. The point of the Matrix films, though, isn't the acting as much as the visuals, stunts and psuedo intellectual discusses the characters have. So it's a good thing that the Wachowski brothers have four (including Hugo Weaving in his marvelous performance as Agent Smith)strong actors in the lead roles.<p>The visuals are much more convincing here than in Reloaded. Although the sequence on the freeway in Reloaded was great looking, there were many substandard effects shots in that film. While there are times (such as a few of the scenes during the assualt on Zion City)the CGI effects aren't completely convincing, that's not too great a sin; consider what they would have looked like with matte paintings, miniatures and stop motion models by comparison. <p>The film isn't quite the classic that the first Matrix was but is an improvement over Reloaded. Revolutions manages is closer to the spirit of the first film in many respects and the parts of the film that echo the quality of the first film are the strongest as well. The conclusion is both bold and idiotic. I was really surprised by the choices the Wachowski brothers made. I said idiotic because they aren't the most commerical and that's a credit to them; they felt that the story had gone as far as it could go. <p>This film, like Reloaded, is about twenty minutes too long. It seems that the Wachowski's and their editor felt it was necessary to give as much screen time as possible to the battle in Zion City because of all the expensive CGI effects (or perhaps they just didn't know how to cut the sequence). Revolutions meanders just a bit but is still enjoyable entertainment. If you're expecting enlightenment, you'll be sadly disappointed as not all the &quot;answers&quot; are provided. It's just as well as Revolutions had the potential to spiral out of control into a mess (much like Lucas' latest Star Wars installments).<p>Revolutions is an action packed film with many surprises. If you give it a chance, you'll enjoy the film. While it runs about twenty minutes too long, it's not a bad way to spend a Saturday night.</p></body></html>

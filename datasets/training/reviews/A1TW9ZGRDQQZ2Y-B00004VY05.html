<meta name="summary" content="The Fifth Element is like a fine wine..."></head><body><p>I wasn't a fan of this movie back when it first came out in 1997, but after years of my father playing it on DVD I began to love it. You had Blade Runner in the 80's and The Fifth Element in the 90's. Both are Sci-Fi epics that are an acquired taste and get better the more times you watch them. This film introduced the world to Milla Jovovich and it's still one of my favorite performances from her. Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman and Chris Tucker (oh so annoying, but it works here) round out the excellent cast and create memorable characters. The unique visuals and music still hold up extremely well and the "blue diva alien" song still never fails to impress. This was one of my first Blu-rays (very good picture quality) and probably gets more play than the others.</p></body></html>

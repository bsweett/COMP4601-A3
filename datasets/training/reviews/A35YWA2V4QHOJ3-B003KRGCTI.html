People struggle to survive, cannibalism becomes common and there is no longer a United States of America.  In its place, small communities basically go back to being city states, and the roads are full of rogues & thieves.<br /><br />Denzel Washington plays a self-sufficient man who is able to take care of himself in spite of all the chaos that the world has descended into.  Books have been burned & most of the inhabitants of the planet are illiterate.<br /><br />This is  a well done movie, and you're always going to get top-notch performances from Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman and Malcom Macdowell.  There is one problem w/this film, however, and that's the simple fact that it's not a very good movie.  Frankly, I found it to be a yawner.  I kept hoping that the denouement would be profound & make up for everything leading up to it, but it just wasn't to be.  I felt like the ending of the movie was like waiting in line for 3 hours to see Mick Jagger only to be stuck with a Roseanne Barr concert instead.<br /><br />There is one demographic who will likely enjoy this film, and that would be far right-wing religious types.  The religious overtones basically take Old Testament topics & place them into the future.  If you're into that sort of thing, then you might like this film.  If you're a person of no religious persuasion whatsoever (like me!) then you're much more likely to find the whole premise of the storyline to be rather banal.  It's your call.</p></body></html>

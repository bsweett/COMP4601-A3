The townsfolk are trapped in a supermarket, with some unknown killer mist outside. One woman wants to go out to find her kids who she left at home. Others respond that the mist might be poison gas. She self-righteously asks if anyone will escort her. The men silently refuse - and the film makes it clear that they're to be ashamed of themselves!<br /><br />Not only that, THEY LET HER OPEN THE DOOR AND LEAVE! That's right, she might be dooming them all to poison gas, but not only is she "the good mother" in this movie, they don't even try to stop her from possibly killing them all! Now that's not normal human behavior.<br /><br />There are many other scenes that just don't make sense at all. Some men cut off a tentacle and later try to convince the others that there's a horrible monster outside ... without showing them the tentacle. Why not just BRING IT AND SHOW THEM? I was getting really annoyed by this time. And there are many other scenes where people just STAND STILL to be killed, rather than running away.<br /><br />There is the stereotypical religious (Christian, what else?) nut calling for human sacrifice and spewing vulgarities and hatred, but that's OK, because, you know, Christian viewers are not going to bomb your building or anything, so it's totally OK to offend them. And it's "brave" and "edgy", too. And everyone knows that's what they're really like, right? But Christophobes will be totally satisfied, if you know what I mean, wink wink. (There is a mention that she is "unstable", but the whole religious-people-are-scum aspect will make a big impression upon ignorant viewers.)<br /><br />The ending was somewhat disgusting (not visually, but logically). You could see it coming a mile off. Again, a scenario where people are not behaving like real people at all, just to score a cheap ... something.<br /><br />Most of the monster effects are neat, especially a behemoth near the end - a real H.P. Lovecraft vibe.</p></body></html>

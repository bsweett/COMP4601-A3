It was real fast paced, the actress was sexy and interesting to look at, the camera angles were cool, the director employed just a hint of animation, the production was artsy yet gutsy, there were cool plot twists and manipulations and the story was good. Most of all, with all of this innovative filmmaking, the ending was satisfying.<br /><br />I give this a big thumbs up!</p></body></html>

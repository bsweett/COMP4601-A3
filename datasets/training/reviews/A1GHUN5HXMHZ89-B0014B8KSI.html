It is more along the lines of "Broadcast News" and "Pelican Brief" but a fair amount of time is spent showing Michael with his dysfunctional family or doing what he does best, fixing things. Not a bad movie but I had some trouble sitting still when he was with his family. There are definitely some exciting parts, mostly near the end when he is running for his life with information on a dirty large company trying to cover up the truth by killing anyone that has knowledge of their polluting the water. Unfortunately although I enjoyed it I felt like I had seen most of it before. If you enjoy dramas about lawyers you will probably enjoy it. Good quality DVD with fair replayability.</p></body></html>

I realize that make me very America-centric, but at this time, in history, ours is the leading culture on earth. It's been many years since I first saw this in a movie theater, but I still watch it every so often. Forrest Gump is proto-American. He's dumb, but honest,loyal, brave, stubborn & unsophisticated. I like to think that most Americans have integrity. The incidents in his life are history, spanning the most dynamic years of the American century. Truly, truly an epic American film classic.</p></body></html>

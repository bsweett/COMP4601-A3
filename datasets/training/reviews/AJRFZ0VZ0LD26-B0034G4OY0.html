But this remarkable man has earned his best credentials later on in his live, once he assumed his place behind the camera.  Many actors turn to creating their own production companies and directing movies, but none has done it with so much success as Clint Eastwood (and occasionally, Robert Redford). Every single movie that was directed by Clint Eastwood created some form of stir.  Here comes a man who is not afraid to ask difficult questions about difficult (and different) experiences in ordinary people's lives.  He is not afraid to challange his viewers and does not back down from his ideas, not matter how difficult they may be on the audiences.<br /><br />In this film there are three parallel stories: one is a sotry about successfull Parisian journalist who escapes death, another one is about a young London boy who looses his twin brother to death while his mother ends up in the rehabilitation center, he is sent off to the foster care.  And there is a blue collar worker in NYC who has psychic ability to speak with dead that haunts his personal and professional life.  Each one of them is struggling with their experiences that other people do not seem to understand. They are outcasts in a society that is so quick in labeling people.  Until one brief moment, when lives of these three people intersect and change their destinies from that moment on to hereafter.<br /><br />Although propbably not as powerful as some of his earlier films, this is still a wonderful story and a great message from Clint Eastwood to his audiences that keeps growing and growing with every story he has to tell...</p></body></html>

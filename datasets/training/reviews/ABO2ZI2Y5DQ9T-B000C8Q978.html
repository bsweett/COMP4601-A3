<meta name="summary" content="Sorry, But Honestly I Found It Self-Indulgent and Boring"></head><body><p>"Sometimes life brings some strange surprises." The tagline of `Broken Flowers' goes like this, but for anyone who has been watching the film of Jim Jarmusch, this film's strangeness hardly comes as surprise. The real point is whether or not you like the director's insistence on his own method of filmmaking, which prefers the minimalist approach to the film's material. And I couldn't bring myself to like his method. Well, in short, it was boring.<br /><br />It is true that Bill Murray again did a fine job as the tired protagonist Don, aging Don Juan-type guy whose simple life-weary facial expressions or poise is always attractive though it is no longer amazing after seeing him deliver dead-pan humor in `Lost in Translation' and other recent films.<br /><br />To him a letter in a pink envelope arrives, which tells some news about his son. With a help from an officious neighbor played by Jeffrey Wright, Don hits the road to search the sender of the letter, and the road movie-like scenario brings him back to his ex-girlfriends played by Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange, and Tilda Swinton.<br /><br />To avoid making vague commentaries about the elusive film, let me talk about the most obvious. Like Spike Lee, Jarmusch has never been good at handling female characters, and he shows it again. It looks as if the director is intent on making them as ordinary as possible, and except for too brief appearance of fantastic and unpredictable Tilda Swinton and the free-thinking daughter of Sharon Stone's character (whose one scene is just jaw-dropping), these female characters including the one played by Julie Delpy are all ciphers. Perhaps you may say this is exactly the point, but then what is the point of Don Juan's visiting these ciphers?<br /><br />The critics as always hailed this film as Jarmusch's masterpiece, but even they seem at a loss to pinpoint what really makes them think the film `beguiling' `existential' and `subtle.' I agree with all these words as far as Bill Murray and Jeffrey Wright are concerned, and I may feel differently when I'm the same age as Don, but honestly, for me, except the opening and ending parts, the film itself is too remote and detached, too slow-paced and self-indulgent to make me awake.</p></body></html>

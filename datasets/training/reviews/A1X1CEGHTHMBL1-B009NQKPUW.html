<meta name="summary" content="A fair movie with good potential but the actions of the crew were just beyond belief!"></head><body><p>As the movie starts a giant pale alien stands upon the Earth as he watches a large spacecraft hovering and beginning to leave him behind.  He drinks a potion out of a sealed vessel.  His body begins to disintegrate and he falls into the flowing water of a waterfall as his DNA dissolves and seeds the Earth for human life.<br /><br />Flash forward to 2089 where scientists find a cave in Scotland with ancient cave paintings showing people worshiping a giant alien who is pointing to a star cluster painted on the ceiling of the cave. It is the same star cluster as painted in numerous cave paintings found around the world and made by civilizations separated by thousands of miles and thousands of years.  Is it an invitation to come visit the home world of the race that created mankind?<br /><br />In 2093 Prometheus is nearing the end of its journey to find the source of the alien message.  It is 200 trillion miles from earth and its crew of 17 is awakened by the ship's systems and the on board robot who has cared for the ship during their sleep.  Will they find the clues about the origins of mankind or unlock Pandora's Box....<br /><br />This movie is touted as a prequel to the Alien series of movies.  It has a great story line and a good cast so the movie had a lot of potential.  I wind up rating it as a 4 star film but it was somewhere between a 3 and a 4 star movie.  The special effects were very good and the acting was also above average.  What lowered the movie in my opinion was the silliness of the script and the actions of the characters.<br /><br />If you were to write down the 10 to 15 things that any intelligent person would not do in the event of an alien encounter while on another planet and watch this movie then you would see them do every one of them in about 2 hours.  What is it with Hollywood that makes them think that having characters behave like this is entertaining?<br /><br />This movie had the potential to be a 5 star movie as the premise was excellent.  The execution of the characters behavior was just outlandishly silly.  I will not list the flaws of the movie here because it would expose too much of the details of the film but to me it dropped the films rating.  I gave it a 3 star rating and my wife gave it a 4.  Since my feeling was between a 3 and a 4 star I compromised to a 4 star.<br /><br />The movie is reasonably entertaining it just is not spectacular in its production.  It is now where near as scary, entertaining or suspenseful as the first Alien movie with Sigourney Weaver.  It had the same potential but poor script writing made you just wish that some of the characters would die because they deserved to for being stupid.<br /><br />It is worth while watching but don't expect a classic that will receive top notch reviews from everyone who sees it.</p></body></html>

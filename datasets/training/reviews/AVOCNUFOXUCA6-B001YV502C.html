<meta name="summary" content="Decent movie"></head><body><p>"Children of Men" is definitely unconventional, and has more than a little originality, something welcome in an era when so many films are simply spat out of screenwriting software.  Cuaron achieves a triumph of cinematography and production design.  The tracking shots are amazing and reflect a mastery of direction and photography.  And the production design is interesting and gives us little bits of the future without the annoying "hey, look at the cool toys" factor of many SF movies.  Indeed, even cars of the future are handled in a way that doesn't make them instantly laughable.  The direction cannot be faulted.  Neither can the actors, who uniformly turn in excellent and convincing performances.  We are immersed in the convincing future world of 2027.<br /><br />So why just three stars?  The script is weak, and leaves you scratching your head at exactly why certain things are happening and what the motivation of certain characters and groups are.  Cuaron has shown himself in the past to be a master of character - getting great performances and characters from his actors - and of direction.  However, story has always been his weak point, and this movie is no exception.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this movie is at least worth a rent.</p></body></html>

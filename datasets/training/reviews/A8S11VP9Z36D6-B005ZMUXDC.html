It is everything i had hoped <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034JKZ3G">The Princess and The Frog</a> would be. Sure, I loved "Princess And The Frog," but "Tangled" is close to perfection in all the major ways: characterization, story, style, and even song. Although I question all the brouhaha about renaming "Rapunzel" so that the male audience wouldn't get turned off by another Princess movie, I fully support the final product! The movie is current yet classic; edgy yet traditional; in short...great Disney entertainment.<br /><br />Flynn Rider is one of the first truly dimensional male leads in a Disney film in years; Zachary Levi does a great job of voicing a character who is more than just a handsome piece of cardboard. Mandy Moore is more than able as the voice for the lead, giving Rapunzel plenty of gumption and a thirst for life after having been couped up in the tower for so long. Although I LOVED the movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049GYXCC">Enchanted</a>, I was less than thrilled with Susan Sarandon's villainess. She almost seemed to walk through the role, lacking the proper subtle menace needed to really create a dark and scary character capable of doing evil deeds. Not a problem here though; Donna Murphy makes Mother Gothel, the evil woman who stole Rapunzel from her royal parents at birth, one of the scariest (albeit subtly) Disney villainesses in a long time. When she tells Rapnzel not to ask her about leaving the tower again, you know she means it!<br /><br />The story is familiar, but here goes a Reader's Digest version: Mother Gothel steals Rapunzel as a baby so that her magical hair will keep her (Mother Gothel) eternally young. To ensure Rapunzel doesn't get wise to the theft, she poses as Rapunzel's mother and locks the young girl away in a secluded tower, constantly warning her that the outside world is evil. As fate would have it, a handsome Robin Hood-esque young man named Flynn Rider is attempting to escape the guards at the Royal Palace, and naturally happens upon Rapunzel's tower while Gothel is gone. Rapunzel sees Flynn as her ticket for a quick escape to see the wonders of the world without Gothel knowing. It should come as no surprise that the best laid plans go awry, and Rapunzel ends up getting much more than she bargained for, with Gothel hot on her trail, desperate to recapture  her fading youth.<br /><br />So why 4 stars instead of 5? First, the picture is perfect. You can practically count the hairs on Rapunzel's head. The beautiful lighting and shading from the Disney Animation Team is shown to its full advantage. And as for the sound...awesome as well! The music surrounds you and you'll be singing the memorable music ("Mother Knows Best" and "When Will My Life Begin") right along with the movie. Obviously, my slight beef is not with the music. Instead, it's with the features. It seems obvious that this set is aimed towards the regular (and possibly more youthful) viewer as opposed to the animation-junkie who wants to see the behind-the-scenes documentaries, intense storyboard sessions, and other rare material that would satisfy the deep cravings of a Disneyphile. Instead, there are hip and comical features that are more fun than informative.<br /><br />Here's what you get:<br /><br />-Untangled: The Making of a Fairy Tale: Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi host this featurette that is more trivia-based than anything very serious or scholarly. Again, definitely aimed at the younger set and those who just want to be entertained. For me, the most interesting part was seeing how the hair of Rapunzel was actually animated. Wow...what a challenge to make it look natural.<br /><br />-Deleted Scenes: Co-directors Byron Howard & Nathan Greco introduce 3 scenes ("The Jaunty Moose," "Chemistry Develops," and "Vigor The Visionary") and explain why they were cut. I have to admit I get a little annoyed with the Disney "deleted scene" features on their discs. Most of these haven't even gotten beyond the storyboard point, so I'm not sure they really qualify as "deleted." Instead, these are more like ideas that were explored but never really quite finished. All of them slow down the pace and definitely are not missed. Enjoyable, but not missed.<br /><br />-Two Original Storybook Openings: Alternate versions of the film's opening, again introduced by Byron  & Nathan. This is at least interesting to see how it pays homage to classic Disney animation as well as how it evolved over each attempt.<br /><br />-50th Animated Feature Countdown: Fun, but again...more on the fluffy side is this montage of the 49 Disney animated films that preceded "Tangled."<br /><br />-9 Tangled Teasers: Another fluff piece...entertaining, funny, and witty...but again, fluff. A series of "trailers" that take the form of parodies of infomercials and other current commercials/news bits.<br /><br />And that's it...other than the usual bag of previews/plugs for upcoming Disney releases.<br /><br />Please don't let the 4 stars deter you; this is truly a fantastic Disney animated classic that deserves to stand proudly with its predecessors. CGI detractors: it's just another art tool like a pencil...this film has many stunning moments, especially the scenes with the lanterns (you just have to get it to see!).<br /><br />SPECS: 1.78:1 widescreen/enhanced for 16x9 with 7.1 DTS-HD, 2.0 Dolby Digital DVS for Bluray and 5.1 Dolby Digital, 2.1 Dolby Digital DVS for DVD. Languages are English, French, and Spanish with subtitles English SDH, French, and Spanish.</p></body></html>

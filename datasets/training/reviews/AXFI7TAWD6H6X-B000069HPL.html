The trailers didn't do the movie justice. I didn't see the movie until this past year and that was when I started to appreciate this movie. I work for a huge mortgage company which basically I would not recommend taking out a loan with given the way they treat their customers which is horrible, not to mention their employees too. What I see in "Office Space" is basically a mirror image of the BS I have to suffer at the office on a daily basis. Mike Judge (creator of "Beavis and Butthead") really captures cubical life in "Office Space". Ron Livingston is hilarious as Peter Gibbons who begins out in the movie stressing out about everything that is going on at his job but after he is hypnotized (which eventually goes awry), Peter stops giving a darn about his job and starts slouching off. Yet that lazy, sloth mentality of Peter's manages to get him far ahead in the company while other people are being screwed over by the company (which I can definitely relate to). Gary Cole is hilarious as the patronizing, condescending jerk of a boss. His line deliveries cracks me up because they come off sounding pleasant yet the message is not so nice, like coming into the office on the weekends. That I can also relate at my job to which scares me. Stephen Root as Milton was even more hysterical. If anything should be learned from Milton is that be careful of who you push around because you never know what could happen. LOL! I love the pieces of flare that Jennifer Aniston has to wear at a TGI-like restaurant. I cracked up when her boss implied that good employees wears lots of pieces of flare (which are basically cheesy buttons). My most personal favorite moment in the film is the Michael Bolton character who immediately snaps at his cubical neighbor and refers to the pop singer of the same name as "a no-talent @$$ clown". I love "Office Space". Anyone who works for a corporation should really watch this movie. You will find this movie bearing a strong resemblence to your job. I know it does for me.</p></body></html>

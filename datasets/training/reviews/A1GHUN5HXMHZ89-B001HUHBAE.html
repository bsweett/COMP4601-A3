<meta name="summary" content="What's your sign?"></head><body><p>In the Sixties horoscopes and a persons zodiac sign were a big deal. So much so that it wasn't uncommon to ask someone's sign when first meeting them. The Zodiac killer filled the news especially on the West coast for some time. Between his grisly murder methods and the police's inability to stop him, the general public was in a state of disbelief. This follows the case closely from many perspectives. The acting is superb with excellent performances by Jake Gyllenhall, Robert Downey Jr., Mike Ruffalo, and the rest the cast. When I first heard about this movie I wasn't interested because many movies like this try so hard to be factual they lose the realism.<br /><br />This movie does an excellent job of giving facts from the case, but making you feel you were there. The acting, directing, sets, and music all make it seem as though you have travelled back in time to those moments in history around this one baffling case. I'm glad I took a chance when a rental store employee recommended it. I ended up buying it because it is thrilling and interesting to see how the police tracked him down after years of his killings and cryptic torment. I highly recommend you at least rent it if you enjoy movies like "Suspect Zero" or "Citizen X". The DVD quality is great and it comes in a nice plastic case.</p></body></html>

Of the few that didn't like it, the commentary seemed to be more about the subject of firing people from their jobs.  George Clooney stars as Ryan who works for a company that handles employment terminations for other companies that don't have the balls to do it themselves.  Hell, I never even knew companies like that existed.  Clooney is cool as a cucumber in the role as you might expect.  He has no real home, or even financial or emotional objectives.  He just wants to fly and live in hotels across the country.  His only goal in life is to become the 7th person to fly 10 million miles on American Airlines.  American, Hilton and Hertz are prominently featured throughout the movie which I suspect help keep production costs down.  Ryan hooks up with another frequent flyer played by Vera Farmiga.  They become sexually entangled as they cross paths in various cities.  As part of a planned less personal approach to terminations Ryan brings with him a new, bright recently hired addition to the firm.  Natalie is played with unusual wit and sophistication by Anna Kendrick.  While not romantically involved, she and Clooney really work well together.  Kendrick is not your usual knock-out-gorgeous woman, but let's hope she gets more meaty roles like this in the future.  This is a smart snappy film about an otherwise unfortunate event that goes on way too often in America these days.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cult &quot;Thing&quot;"></head><body><p>An alien theme plays as a helicopter flies across the South Pole landscape.  Below it is a wolf dog, running through the snow.  Apparently, the helicopter is chasing the dog.  The pilot emerges with a gun and begins firing at the creature as it runs towards a base of American scientists.<p>Soon, this doesn't sound as strange as it seems.  Kurt Russell stars as the American scientist who learns the secret of the creature: it's over 100,000 years old, frozen beneath the ice, and pissed off.  We also learn that if it reaches civilization, within 27,000 hours the entire planet would be taken over by this creature - an alien lifeform that can imitate whatever it kills.  Dogs, spiders, grandma - this thing can do it.  It's up to old 'Russ to save the day and destroy everything in sight in a blind rage.<p>When first released in 1982, &quot;The Thing&quot; met with mixed critical reaction - most of it bad.  It was either &quot;not scary&quot; or &quot;relies on special effects&quot;, but rarely would you find a positive review.  Now, in the new millenium, the film is finally getting the recognition it deserves.  &quot;The Thing&quot; has quite deservedly joined the ranks of the most famous horror films of all-time.  It is even arguably more popular than it's basis, the 1951 sci-fi classic &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;.<p>First we'll cover the more commonly debated aspects of the film.  One is the acting.  I felt the acting was excellent, especially Russell as the determined chosen leader of the team.  Donald Moffat is the only other actor in the crew that is somewhat popular, but that has no affect whatsoever on the cast.<p>The on-screen title of the film is &quot;John Carpenter's The Thing&quot;, and Carpenter is probably the movie's second-most-important aspect.  His direction is eerie and suspenseful - this movie helped elevate him to his current position as a thriller genius.  If you truly look at this film, you can tell Carpenter wasn't trying to make it scary - he wanted to make it suspenseful, although there are a few jumpy moments in this film.<p>There's also a fitting and chilling score by Ennio Morricone.  It definitely doesn't rank amongst the master composer's greatest scores, but it works well on the mood of the film.<p>The most important, and no doubt the greatest, aspect of the film is Rob Bottin's special effects.  They are extraodinary.  Every scene involving the alien parasite is completely convincing.  Whether it's a gruesome alien bursting from a dog's body, or a severed head sprouting spider-like legs and walking around the room, the effects are outstanding.  Bottin proves himself to be a make-up genius.<p>It's no wonder &quot;The Thing&quot; is a classic.  Its documentary-like feel and creepy atmosphere are perfect.  Carpenter has succeeded in making a thrilling wonder that may even surpass it's aforementioned story source.  No horror, sci-fi or thriller fan should go without at least taking a look at this chiller masterpiece.</p></body></html>

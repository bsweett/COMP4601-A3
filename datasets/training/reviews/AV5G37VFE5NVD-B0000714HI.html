Mike Myers once again returns as Austin Powers, who this time must confront an array of enemies which includes Dr. Evil (Myers), Fat Bastard (Myers), and his newest foe - Goldmember (Myers).  By his side is sexy Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles) - of course, all of the original gang is back as well.  There's more spoofs and an outrageous opening sequence featuring plenty of big-name cameos; it leaves behind most of it's sex humor, however, to go for potty humor - but there's just as much laughs and entertainment as any other Austin Powers film.  Groovy, baby, yeah!</p></body></html>

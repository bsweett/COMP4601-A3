<meta name="summary" content="ROMANCE ROMANCE"></head><body><p>For fans of Nancy Meyers (writer-director, SOMETHING's GOTTA GIVE, WHAT WOMEN WANT...), you are in for a big time treat.  This movie is so wildly, over-the-top romantic that it will put you in a state of romantic delirium.  You may never want to come back to the light of day after sitting in the movie theatre with Kate Winslet (never more beguiling), Jude Law (never more impossibly handsome), Jack Black (never more vulnerable) and Cameron Diaz (never more gorgeous).  The Christmas card plot offers plenty of moist-eyed moments as well as flat-out laughs.  I can't remember the last time I loved a sappy movie this much...maybe STEPMOM came close.  Merry Holidays to all...enjoy!</p></body></html>

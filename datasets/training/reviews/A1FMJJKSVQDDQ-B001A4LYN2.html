This is due to the fact that both were from the same studios (Miramax & Paramount Vintage), and were in production at the same time (and right next to each other). I don't see why people should argue which film is better than the other. They're two completely different films. NCFOM is based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, while TWBB is based on the book "Oil!" by Upton Sinclair. NCFOM is set in 1980, TWBB is set in the early 20th century. One's about violence, the other's about greed. And so on. But I do admit, I slightly prefer NCFOM over TWBB, mostly because of the silent suspense and the absolutely creepy performance of Javier Bardem. But TWBB is still a great film as well.<br /><br />As I've said before, this film is mostly about greed and how it affects us and the people around us. Daniel Plainview (played by the excellent Daniel Day-Lewis) is a wealthy businessman who relies on oil for his profits. Accompanied by his adopted son H.W. (Dillon Freasier), both individuals are led to a barren California city called Little Boston. There, they discover oil that's been leaked out of the ground due to a recent earthquake. With careful planning, Daniel attempts to buy the entire city, with just a few issues at hand. A young man by the name of Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) wants $10,000 to build his church, The Church of the Third Revelation. From this point on, it's a battle between religion, hypocrisy, wealth, and family.<br /><br />Like NCFOM, TWBB tends to be very slow-moving. I see this in a good way. This film doesn't move too quick because we get to see the characters being clearly and fully affected by the oil that's sleeping underground. They are fully realized, as the slow pacing helps us understand these people. Speeding it up in a Hollywoodized way won't help since this is indeed a character-driven story. With the slower and steadier way, there is no confusion on what's going on, and the partial ambiance that surrounds the movie adds to the tension between Daniel and Eli. Speaking of Daniel and Eli, I just have to say that the actors have done a splendid job. Before this, I've seen only one film that stars Day-Lewis: Last of the Mohicans. He was absolutely amazing in that film, and he is even more amazing here. You never know when he's going to lose his temper, or what he's really going to do in the next scene, which makes the character even scarier. Meanwhile, according to imdb, Dano had only four days to prepare for the role of Eli, since another actor had to be replaced for reasons unknown. Thankfully, he was able to pull it off. The quiet determination of the character is fully realized, and you can never tell if he's a hypocrite or just someone who thinks he's seen God. As for the supporting cast, they play their parts very well. The one exception here is Kevin J. O'Connor: he's seems very wooden at times. But other than that, Dillon Freasier and the other supporting actors can be very believable throughout the entire film.<br /><br />Almost everything else in TWBB(cinematography, set designs, etc.) are flawless. And I say almost, because I had just one tiny problem. A few music cues that are chosen here don't seem to fit the scenes that they play in. But the music can be very appropriate at times, like Johhny Greenwood's percussive "Convergence" when both tragedy and success strike in the middle of the film. The piece itself adds greater suspense and drama in this very important part of the film. TWBB overall is one of the more marvelous films of 2007. Day-Lewis deserved the oscar, as well as Robert Elswit for the stellar cinematography.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></body></html>

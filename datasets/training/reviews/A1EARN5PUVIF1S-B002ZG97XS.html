<meta name="summary" content="A New Low for John Cusack"></head><body><p>John Cusack once had talent and a promising career.  Now he not only stars in, but apparently also produced, this appallingly stupid, vulgar, and unfunny time-travel comedy.<br /><br />You know you're in for a long ninety minutes when you get one dog poop and one human piss joke in the first five minutes.  And that's about the height of the hilarity on display here.<br /><br />Really -- if you like bodily excretions -- or you're almost horizontally drunk -- you might enjoy this horribly acted, written, and directed film.<br /><br />Everyone else with an ounce of intelligence, taste, or sobriety should steer far clear.<br /><br />This is truly one of the worst so-called comedies I've ever seen.  I paid a buck to rent this film from Redbox for one night -- and I still feel cheated.<br /><br />Other famous whores on display here include Chevy Chase and Crispin Glover.  I feel sorry for the lot of them, but not as sorry as I feel for anyone who finds anything to laugh at here.  A wretched waste of celluloid -- and time.</p></body></html>

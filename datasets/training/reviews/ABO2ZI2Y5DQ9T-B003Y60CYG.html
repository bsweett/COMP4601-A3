<meta name="summary" content="Bittersweet Portraits of People Facing the Final Curtain -- and Altman's Last Film"></head><body><p>It's an amusing mixture of fiction and reality. The `last broadcast' of America's radio show hosted by "G. K." real Garrison Keillor is deftly directed by Robert Altman with an on-stage show that features celebrated Hollywood actors including Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, Woody Harrelson, John C. Reilly, L.Q. Jones and Lindsay Lohan, and the show's real cast and musicians. "A Prairie Home Companion" is all about the radio show of the title in the Fitzgerald Theater affectionately depicted by Altman.<br /><br />There is not much to tell in the film except that as a certain big company bought the radio station of the town, and it will be the last show for everyone tonight. A mysterious lady in white (Virginia Madsen) shows up before the PI named "Guy Noir" (Kevin Kline playing the character of the real radio show), and back stories of a few characters are told or suggested (most memorably about the Johnson sisters played by Streep and Tomlin), but nothing big or surprising happens here.<br /><br />Robert Altman's approach is very simple. Though cowboy singers Dusty and Lefty (Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly) are very funny, some may find the entire story slow and boring. I don't blame it. After all, the film is not about the story.<br /><br />Or not even exactly about the radio show of the title. Like he did in "The Player" he mixes reality with fantasy, and blurs the thin line dividing them to the extent of surrealism. Kline's Guy Noir walks and talks in a slightly exaggerated way against the reality-based background of radio show. Lohan's character casually uses cell phone in the 1950-ish diner as if breaking the entire atmosphere. Even a dead person (or angel) arrives and can talk to mortals. It's Robert Altman, director of fantastic "MASH" and "Gosford Park" and, well, awful "Popeye." His touch could be double-edged, but I think it works in "A Prairie Home Companion."<br /><br />Altman is always good at handling ensemble cast, and here he shows it again. Using HD cameras that move as if floating in the air, the director guides us through the theater, on stage and at the backstage, and lets us meet the people there. He gives everyone of his ensemble cast a chance to shine, and successfully captures their moment which are sweet, bitter, or both. The film is a tribute to the good, old days that are going, with the tenderly drawn portrait of the people facing the final curtain of their life.</p></body></html>

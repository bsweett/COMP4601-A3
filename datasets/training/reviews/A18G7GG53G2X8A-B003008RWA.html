Out of all his documentaries, "Sicko" is probably his most thought provoking. This can be said from both a liberal and conservative perspective; whatever your political beliefs are, whatever your moral standards, I think everyone in America should be required to see this film. A bold thing to say, I know, but I really do feel that way. Not only does it bring a number of health care-related issues to the surface, it also sheds light on how health care operates in other countries. Canada, the United Kingdom, and France, for example, all rely on a universal system, in which medical services are fully subsidized by the government. In today's day and age, when for-profit American health care shows every sign of collapsing under its own weight, understanding how other western countries look after their sick and injured is very important.<br /><br />When word spread about Moore's new documentary, a number of major pharmaceutical companies ordered their employees to completely avoid him should an interview be requested. For all intents and purposes, Moore managed to get someone's attention. Such is the way with "Sicko," a film that can effectively get anyone's attention with its mixture of figures, humor, and heartbreak. Can such tactics be considered manipulative? Yes, they can. But so can news reports and magazine articles and newspaper headlines, all of which we rely on for information. Maybe this is subject matter that requires manipulation, if only for the sake of forcing us out of our comfort zones. As I see it, many problems that have been pushed aside finally need to be addressed.<br /><br />The film's origins date back to early 2006, during which Moore made an on-line reqeust for health care horror stories. He received thousands of e-mails within a week. Some of the more dramatic stories are highlighted at the beginning of the film, such as a man who accidentally sawed off the tips of his left middle and ring fingers. Because he did not have health insurance, he was given two options: have the middle tip reattached for $60,000, or the ring tip for $12,000. The fact that he chose the ring tip isn't the point. For that matter, neither is the fact that he wasn't insured; Moore makes it clear that this film is really about insured Americans who feel that their plans have failed them. Consider a couple forced to move into their daughter's home after a paying a series of medical bills; the husband suffered three heart attacks and the wife was diagnosed with cancer.<br /><br />With that and other such devastating examples, Moore examines the history of American health care and it's eventual effects. I distinctly remember footage from a 1996 congressional testimony given by guilt stricken Dr. Linda Peeno, formerly a medical reviewer for the health insurer Humana. Nearing tears, she admitted that her job was to save money for the company, not to treat the sick or injured. She then recalls denying medical care for a man in 1987, resulting in his death. Moore also examines connections between lobby groups and political groups. Back in the 1950s, the idea of universal health care was considered Socialist, and therefore un-American. Years later, Hillary Clinton proposed a plan for national health care. It might have happened had she not sold out and accepted campaign money from the pharmaceutical industry.<br /><br />The more compelling examples of patient mistreatment are presented near the end of the film. Moore interviews three September 11, 2001 volunteers who have since developed medical problems due to Ground Zero's extreme conditions. The government will not provide them with any medical care; they're not firefighters, and therefore, they're not government employees. The prisoners held on Guantanamo Bay, on the other hand, have complete medical coverage. In response to this, Moore escorts the volunteers to Guantanamo Bay via boat, stating that America's heroes should be given the same medical treatment as America's enemies.<br /><br />But out of all the stories presented, this one is by far the most interesting. Jim Kenefick, designer of an anti-Michael Moore website, was suddenly faced with the possibility of shutting his website down. His wife had become ill, and the cost of her medical bills exceeded the amount he spent on web development. In desperation, he pleaded for help by posting an on-line request for money ("In Need of a Christmas Miracle!" was its title). Moore anonymously sent him a check for $12,000 in what was surely one of the most selfless acts of generosity ever. The medical bills were paid. The website continues to run. I think Mr. Kenefick owes it to himself to see "Sicko"; his First Amendment right to bash Moore is openly defended.<br /><br />Considering everything I've said, I feel it necessary to explain a few things. My intention in writing this review is not to change anyone's mind about American health care, and while I personally agree with Michael Moore's position, I'm not asking anyone to do the same. I want people to see "Sicko" only because it reintroduces an important issue, and important issues should always be discussed.</p></body></html>

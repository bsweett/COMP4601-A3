<meta name="summary" content="Shoes are the only thing they have in common"></head><body><p>This movie is based on Jennifer Weiner's book of the same name. I enjoyed In Her Shoes, but since I read the book before I saw the movie I was dissapointed in the movie because of the noticable differences between the two.<br /><br />The story-line is the same Rose and Maggie are sisters that have nothing in common, but their shoe size, but after a parting of the ways they find that they have to mend fences when the grandmother that they thought was dead ends up very much alive and well and living in Florida. Very good acting by Toni Collet and Cameron Diaz.</p></body></html>

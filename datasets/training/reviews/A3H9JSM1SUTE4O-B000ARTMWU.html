<meta name="summary" content="SICK, SLICK HORROR"></head><body><p>Once you press Play, even though every cell in your body screams "Turn away," you won't be able to stop watching the derivative but jolting nightmare.  This very scary, eye-popping, relentlessly bloody exercise in the horrific.  This story about being chased by a maniacal, blade-wielding, body-slicing killer is not for all tastes.  A much talked about hit in its native France, this slick, sick film caught viewers off guard and the buzz generated long lines at the box office.<br /><br />The plot is simple: Close college friends Marie and Alexia are spending a weekend at Alexia's parents' secluded country farmhouse. They plan to study for exams.  But in the darkest hours, their idyllic get-a-way is interrupted by a stranger wielding a knife and they fight for their lives against an seemingly unstoppable human predator.<br /><br />This one makes TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (original and remake) look like a nursery rhyme, but the last shot left me scratching my head.  Perhaps this is really a lesbian love story disguised as slasher/horror film?</p></body></html>

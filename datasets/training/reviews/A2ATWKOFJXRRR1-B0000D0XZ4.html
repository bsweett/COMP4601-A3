To like or not to like this film seems to set a precedence with the reviewer as either a bonafide moron or a person who enjoys something that might be a breakthrough in the comic-book to movie industry.  <p>Well, I liked it . . . a lot.  Why?<p>This is a film made for the comic book fan (I loved the original comic books with their great artwork).  Ang Lee (the director) even pulls up images on the screen (occasionally) that are block-like, giving you the feeling that you're watching a type of moving comic book, but with real characters.<p>The cast of characters in this film is impressive, too: Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Nick Nolte and Sam Elliot.  It's just a shame that a bit more time wasn't taken to go over the script and fix a few dialogue problems.  Some of it seems forced, just a patch-work to help the plot move along.  But...<p>This still didn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film for me.  New ideas were incorporated (something that some 'Hulk Purists' might find offensive), and I found them refreshing.  Let's not forget that the Hulk comic strip never stayed static, either folks.  In this film, nano-technology was introduced.  But it never became over-burdensome with techno-babble.  The action of the film and its characters stayed in the forefront of the film.  <p>The movie follows pretty closely the development of Bruce Banner into the Hulk.  Except here, there's a genetic component along with the nano-machines and Gamma radiation accident.  Ang Lee also incorporated some great family dynamics that come back to bite the audience on the nose.  <p>It was a good film.  I really enjoyed watching it.  I might even watch it again.  Enjoy.<p>A- rating</p></body></html>

The execution of WRONG TURN is even more banal than the premise, which, given assured direction and a twisted script should've been a slam dunk creepy slice and dicer.  Lo, it aint.  Instead we get a group of the dumbest woodland victims ever filmed and a group of disfigured redneck cannibals that aren't as scary as REAL disfigured redneck cannibals.  The result is a film that offers little atmosphere and a few cheap jolts that just qualify it as a horror movie.  Back to the dumb woodland victims- they go exploring a shack in the middle of the woods that contains several clues to the grizzly inhabitants activities, yet take time to make sure they check every room whilst looking for a phone and/or toilet.  They wanted to die, obviously.  Everyone who gets it (you know who they are right off the bat) dies in a FRIDAY THE 13TH fashion that's all blood and latex, with little creativity, and even less originality.  The main characters are even more cardboard than the supporting bodies and are never developed in the short running time (WRONG TURN clocks in at 80 min. AFTER the end credits).  Every horror cliche is played; from the main chick the villians decide to change their M.O. for and NOT kill instantly down to the clueless cop who you know is going to get it before he is even introduced.  ELIZA DUSHKU plays the &quot;tough girl&quot; to a new annoying extreme that forces one, like in most run-of-the-mill slasher flicks, to root for the bad guys.  So many genere films have started with a similar plotline and all fail in the shadow of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.  With a remastered DVD now out, watching LEATHERFACE and his twisted clan scare up the creepy horror WRONG TURN lacks would be a turn in the right direction.</p></body></html>

But seriously, it's THE one you cannot be without, a fan of the movie or not.<br /><br />George A. Romero's HUGE-scale sequel to Night of the Living Dead takes his simple, but scary, idea and expands from an isolated farmhouse to the whole planet. The zombies are EVERYWHERE and there is no escape. Resistance is futile. A couple of SWAT team members quickly figure this out and skip on their evacuation duties to just get out of the city in their own quicker way. Hooking up with a couple of traffic reporters in a chopper they take off in search of a safe haven. Along the way they see the world below react to the oncoming Armageddon and end of civilization.<br /><br />After spotting a deserted shopping mall below the quartet land on the roof and barricade themselves inside as the world very quickly crumbles. Hope is rapidly running out and much time passes with no word from what remains of the world.<br /><br />While not as scary as the remake, this film does make up by having a sick sense of humor and a larger story to tell. I won't pass off cheeky subtext as my own discovery (every other review here does) but it is quite intelligent (if a bit dated in the present day). There's a lot of depth to Dawn of the Dead and it's all well thought out and planned rather than being generic and unoriginal like so many other modern horror movies.<br /><br />There characters (especially Ken Foree) are all strong and believable and react with logic and sense rather than annoying panic. It's interesting to see how normal people take on facing the end of civilization (if not the end of the world...just humans) with just simple tools and the bare minimum at their reach.<br /><br />The opinions over the original and remake are pretty much split. I think that both are very strong efforts at true horror and instead of regarding them as original/remake I think it's wiser to consider them as two separate stories both happening at the same time.<br /><br />Each film has their weaknesses and strengths. The zombies in the original are a bit too comical to be truly threatening. While in the remake they'd be on you, ripping your throat out before you can even say 'What the..?' And the actual 'DAWN' of the dead was more emphasized in the remake. Though the original has more of a true epic feel to it.<br /><br />This release features 3 different versions of the film. The 126 minute American cut, the 117 minute European Cut and the Extended 139 minute version. The German 156 cut does not get a mention. Extra features are plentiful and, for once, they're for a film where extras make sense, not the fluff we get usually. Two big documentaries 'The Dead Will Walk' and 'Document of the Dead' are included as well as loads of commentaries, interviews, clips, trailers etc. Even a mini version of the first issue of the DOTD comic book. The American and European versions are Divimax which means an excellent 1.85:1 anamorphic picture and Dolby 6.1/DTS sound. The extended cut is plain old anamorphic and Mono.<br /><br />This is definitely a horror classic, far above Psycho and Silence of the Lambs. True greatness and not only an important film but a true labor of love. Everyone involved made it because they love the genre and were not just trying to pay this weeks rent cheque. An important element missing from 99.99% of horror films made these days. Keep a lookout for Jason make-up man Tom Savini (who is always the highlight of any movie) as Blade an remember Ken Foree's chilling prophecy...'When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth'</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Break-Up"></head><body><p>Gary (Vaughn) and Brooke (Aniston) are the perfect couple, until one evening when everything falls apart.  During the huge fight, we out Brooke thinks Gary is lazy and thoughtless, and Gary thinks Brooke is too controlling and unappreciative.  She dumps him, but neither of them want to give up the condo that they own together.  They each mark their territory, and set about doing whatever it takes to drive the other out.<br /><br />Vaughn and Aniston are well cast, and have a chemistry together.  Supporting cast, including Jon Favreau and Joey Lauren Adams as their best friends, do good jobs and help keep the movie moving.  There are even some really funny scenes.  Yet, something is missing.  Perhaps the characters are not nasty enough to each other.  Anyway, while somewhat entertaining, "The Break-Up" fall a little short of success.</p></body></html>

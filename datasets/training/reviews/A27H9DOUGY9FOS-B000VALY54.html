<meta name="summary" content="Stylized and Self-Aware--A Hip Hollywood Noir Succeeds When It Shouldn't Have"></head><body><p>"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" is a fascinating example of a film almost too "cool" for it's own good.  Stylized, somewhat self-satisfied, so pleased with it's own cleverness--this type of movie can easily rub me the wrong way!  But the odd thing is, "Kiss Kiss" walks that fine line so precariously--yet falls onto the side of good entertainment.  It's fast paced, funny and filled with good performances.  Even though the picture tries so hard, I ended up admiring that effort as opposed to being put off by it.<br /><br />The ostensible plot of "Kiss Kiss" really isn't that important.  Let's just say that Robert Downey, Jr., is a small time crook masquerading as an actor masquerading as a detective.  The film works as a homage to every pulp fiction detective story you've ever read and/or seen.  Following all the necessary conventions, yet tweaking them with abundant humor, it's a twisty and fun ride.  It's not the most difficult mystery to unravel but with "Kiss Kiss," it's all about the journey.<br /><br />But in addition to being a send-up of pulp detective and noir films, "Kiss Kiss" actually works as an effective satire on Hollywood as well.  It's pretty spot-on in it's depiction of the Hollywood "scene" and the community on the cusp of success.  And this, blended with the mystery, provide an absurd and magical backdrop to the story.  But the success of "Kiss Kiss" relies most heavily on it's screenplay.  One of the funniest, self-aware (but in a good way), and fastest scripts I've seen in a long time--most of the lines are delivered so quickly and in such a dead pan manner, it takes a moment to process just how witty they are.  This is an intelligent comedy for someone that appreciates cleverness, and you miss a lot of humor if you're not paying close attention.  It once again balances well--this time mainstream humor with "inside" industry jokes--so that everyone can enjoy this sly film.<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr., has a certain loose, hangdog appeal as the lead.  This is the type of material he excels at.  Val Kilmer has received a lot of attention as a gay private eye and it's a nicely controlled performance.  It's good to see him return to sophisticated entertainment.  And Michelle Monaghan also does nicely in the sexy, smart girlfriend role.<br /><br />Recommended to mystery and comedy lovers, and particularly suited to film geeks and noir enthusiasts--"Kiss Kiss" works on that rare level of absurd, but intelligent, entertainment.

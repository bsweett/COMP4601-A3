All of them have run ashoal on the insurmountable problem odf the novel's structure.  Sam Mendes, the talented British director, thought he had it licked.  He didn't see the trouble coming from the opposite direction: while he was making this show, US television was delivering MAD MEN, a Revolutionary Road knockoff that manages to outdo the original in every direction.  Uh-oh, what a disaster, not in execution but just in comparison to the TV version, the Mendes picture just seems like a mighty waste of talent.<br /><br />Others have listed the similarities, so I won't bother, but I will say that MAD MEN has made this picture not only superfluous but actually an object of curiosity.  Watching Kate and Leo in what seems like a dutiful recreation of the American 50s, I began feeling restless wondering why even bother putting it back in the 50s?  Wouldn't it have been more honest, less glamorous, if the filmmakers had made it happen today?  What would possibly have made the least amount of difference?  The Wheelers would have the same ennui at living unfulfilled lives.  April would still have been an awful actress (this was a holdover from the Yates original, one of the many ways in which we know that Yates hated women).  Her despair at being ten weeks pregnant, the way Frank uses this as a bargaining chip to make her stay home.  Everything could have taken place in 2008 and you wouldn't have a picture dripping with all that Kodachrome quaintness that ultimately ruins the picture.  These types of movies are made to make audiences feel better, as if to say, look how awful people had it back then, nothing like this could possibly happen today.<br /><br />As the office mope who sleeps with friendly Frank, Zoe Kazan tries, but the writing just doesn't give her anything to work with.  Think of the various girls Don Draper has it on with, and the contrast is just humiliating to Mendes.  I love Richard Yates, always have, but we've come to a point when others do him better than he did himself (except for EASTER PARADE and A GOOD SCHOOL).</p></body></html>

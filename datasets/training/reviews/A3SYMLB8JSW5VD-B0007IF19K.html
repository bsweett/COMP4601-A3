Starring the multi-talented Jamie Foxx who does an oscar-worthy performance in the movie Ray. With an excellent supporting cast with the standouts being Kerry Washington and Regina King.This movie shows the triumph of the human spirit. Mr. Ray Charles truly lived up to this his mother words "Don't let nobody make you a cripple". Also the DVD extras were fantastic especially the jam sessions between Ray Charles and Jamie Foxx. This is a must get.</p></body></html>

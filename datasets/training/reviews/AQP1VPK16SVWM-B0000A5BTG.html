<meta name="summary" content="Fun adventure film"></head><body><p>Make no mistake The Core isn't science fiction. In fact, the little bit of science it has in it is closer to fantasy than fact. The Core has more in common with Journey to the Center of the Earth than with The Posideon Adventure or Earthquake!. At its (pardon the pun)core is the spirit of adventure. <p>The planet's core has stopped rotating. That's bad news because the electromagnetic field generated by the spinning core protects us from harmful microwave radiation and temperatures that make those in the Sahara seem like a spa. Dr. Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) has discovered this due to a fluke. He passes along the information to a world famous scientist with an ego the size of the Titanic (and just as flawed I might add). <p>This scientist (deliciously played by the talented Stanley Tucci)is alarmed enough to contact the government agencies he works with. Suddenly Keyes is pulled in to work on a project to literally jump start the planet's magnetic core using nuclear devices. Otherwise, all life on Earth will be dead within a year leaving behind charred, burned desolate corpse of a world. <p>An inventor (well played with humor by Delroy Lindo)has come up with a new compound that actually increases its strength the more pressure it is exposed to. It can also withstand molten temperatures. A crew of 6 is selected to make this perilous journey with a very good chance that none of them will come back.<p>Certainly you have to suspend your disbelief. The Core stands in fine company as a theatrical roller coaster ride. The optical effects are generally outstanding. Director Jon Amiel indicated in interviews that he wanted to recreate the awe he felt when he saw films like War of the Worlds and Journey to the Center of the Earth. He manages to do so. This isn't Shakesphere but the entire cast plays their roles with humor and bring their respective characters to life. Filled with cliches, tongue in cheek humor and inventive touches, The Core transcends its limitations. It's a great little popcorn movie.</p></body></html>

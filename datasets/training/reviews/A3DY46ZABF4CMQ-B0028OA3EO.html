<meta name="summary" content="Superman Returns flies flat on its face!"></head><body><p>Once John William's extraordinary score comes blasting out with the title Superman Returns popping up on the screen, and the credits flying across the screen (a nod to the original Superman film), I felt like jumping and cheering. Unfortunately, that was to be the most excitement I would get throughout the 150 minutes I spent watching the most disappointing sequel of the year so far.<br /><br />You can't help but watch Superman Returns and think about Christopher Reeve, Jackie Cooper, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, Marc Maclure, and Marlon Brando (the only actor from the original that we actually see and hear in Returns). The reason why you can't stop thinking about those actors and hope you can see them onscreen instead of the actual actors who are in the film is because none of the actual stars, excluding Brandon Routh, convinces you that they are Perry White, Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, and Jimmy Olsen.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth is just too young (merely 23 years of age) and not vibrant enough to play Lois. Besides, there is no chemistry between her and Routh, who plays Clark Kent and Superman pretty swell! Kal Penn, who played Kumar in Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle, plays one of Luthor's thugs, but his character doesn't speak throughout the film (what a waste of comedic talent), the kid who plays Jimmy Olsen is not funny, and annoys you everytime he appears onscreen. Finally, there's Frank Langella (the man who played Skeletor opposite Dolph Lundgren's He-Man in Masters Of The Universe) who doesn't have the natural charm that Cooper brought to the Perry White character.<br /><br />Now let's talk about the script: horrendous. The plot and the plot twists are just one big mess aside from some unnecessary special effects and action sequences (the airplane crashing scene where Lois tumbles from one end of the airplane to another), and Clark Kent drinking beer (didn't Superman confess that he never drinks nor lies in his interview with Lois Lane in the original film? It seems Supe is a liar after all!). Warner seems to have rushed through pre-production picking one of the worse drafts of the scripts for production, but why? I'm not going to go into the details, but what were they thinking with the last 30 minutes of the film? Have they lost their minds? This is a Superman movie...not a Lois Lane movie (I hope those of you who saw it understand what I mean?).<br /><br />The only two good things about the movie are Brandon Routh and the opening credits and musical score. With that aside, Superman Returns flies flat on its face!<br /><br />Not recommended unless you're a gigantic Superman fanatic.<br /><br />D</p></body></html>

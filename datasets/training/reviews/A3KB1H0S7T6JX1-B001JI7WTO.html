The film brings to the screen a scientist whose brother was lost trying to retrace the steps of Verne's characters.<br />Don't look for the movie to make any sense; it doesn't, as it is totally unbelievable even for a Verne's novel.<br />Brendan Fraser, Josh Hutcherson, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well though the acting is nothing extraordinary. The revelation is in relation to the lovely Anita Briem who steals the show and proves beyond any doubt that she has the potential to have a great career in acting.<br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music are all right, though there was plenty of room for improvement.<br />In a nutshell, it's not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment for pre-teens. 3 Stars</p></body></html>

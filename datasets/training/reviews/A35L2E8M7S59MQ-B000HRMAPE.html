<meta name="summary" content="Wow!  Best in the series thus far; criminally underrated"></head><body><p>The Tom Cruise vehicle that has been the "Mission Impossible trilogy" (based on the classic television series) has for the most part been an uneven (often lackluster) film experience.  `Mission: Impossible' released in 1996 directed by Brian De Pama had some action scenes that have since its release been parodied countless times, but its script lacked serious focus; often M:I becoming unnecessarily confusing for an inattentive audience member (or even an attentive viewer).  Then John Woo gave it a fling with `Mission: Impossible: II'; a poor post-Matrix action movie which lacked a coherent plot and was riddled with pointless action scenes.<br /><br />Now, with a third movie a third man takes the director's chair.  J.J. Abrams (TV's Lost, and 2009's Star Trek) takes the helm of this thus-far iffy series to try and return steer it back from the comic-book goofiness that was Woo's Mission: Impossible: II.<br /><br />I can say, without a doubt in my mind, that he's succeeded where both of the two previous directors have failed.  `Mission: Impossible: III' (M:i:III) takes the best from the previous two films and leaves behind the bad creating an absorbingly entertaining film going experience.  Tight action scenes tied in with great performances from Cruise and the supporting cast (which includes Academy Award winner Philip Seymour Hoffman) balances what could have been a dumb action flick.<br /><br />This time around Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has retired from IMF to try and lead a quieter life, opting to continue his contribution to the community by training future agents.  Engaged to the love of his life, Julia (Michelle Monaghan) he wishes to avoid danger, but when he learns that his favorite student, Lindsey Farris (Keri Russel) has gone missing on an investigation of a vicious arms dealer he decides to lead his old team back into action.<br /><br />But when a rescue mission goes horribly wrong Ethan finds breaking off his retirement- taking the task of pursuing the arms dealer, Owen Davian (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who is more powerful than they had predicted.  This arms dealer is as well-informed as he is heartless and Hunt will learn that his skills will be put to the test both mentally and physically if he is to have any hope of bringing the criminal mastermind down.<br /><br />This film has the most grounded plot in the trilogy as well as having the best performance from Cruise.  In the first film Ethan Hunt was very typical secret agent.  In the second he was James Bond-meets-The Matrix.  M:i:III Ethan Hunt is portrayed as an actual human being who has emotions yet knows that he has a job to do and that he's the only one who can do it.  It's not a landmark performance, but it is a vast improvement over the last two interpretations by Cruise which seemed wooden; vehicles for action who the audience couldn't legitimately relate to on any level.<br /><br />A strong supporting cast improves since their last appearances in M:i:II, but the show comes close to being stolen by Hoffman's portrayal of Owen Davian.  This is a GREAT villain!  No doubt about it.  He's more vicious than a Bond villain, yet just as well-cultured if not more so and he always keeps a menacing calm in his tone.  Hoffman always seems to talk-down to everyone around him even when he's  being held captive- it's like he feels himself to be a higher level of human being.  Hoffman gives this character a great deal of depth, even though he could have easily pulled something cheesy or uninspired (given that the writing for the character is rather weak).<br /><br />For these reasons M:i:III is my favorite thus far in the series.  I give the movie a 9/10 star rating<br /><br />M:i:III also boasts the best collector's edition of all the DVD releases of the trilogy.  Tom Cruise and director J.J. Abrams give a funny, informative commentary that never gets boring.  All the featurettes are mighty entertaining (with some exceptions) and help you understand what the crew and actors went through.  I really appreciate how much fun these people seemed to have in making this film.  People like to get on Tom Cruise, but when I see a guy who seems to be having this much fun working with a crew I could care less what his religious views are.  From what I see these guys had a load of fun with this film and that reflects on the film where everyone seems to be more engaged with their on-screen performances.<br /><br />10/10 for the Collector's Edition DVD/Blu-Ray set for Mission: Impossible: III</p></body></html>

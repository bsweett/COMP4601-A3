<meta name="summary" content="Saving the world from the scum of movie making"></head><body><p>The classic government conspiracy surrounding the UFO and alien phenomenon comes out at last with explosive and literally gooey force.  It's a film that takes almost every aspect of the government conspiracy theory (the black-suited men, the aliens, the spaceships, and power-freak teachers) and puts it in a funny and exciting reference.<p>The film's story line is relatively simple and small-scale, but still leaves much room for thrills, suspense, humor, and imagination.  At the same time, it allows characters sufficient room to develop.  The actors of the film did a swell job in this film, and are topped only by the film's special effects.<p>Combined with a great theme song and musical score, this film is most enjoyable.  The special features in this disc set makes the movie even more worth it.  It's a deluxe deal!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="RAID!!!!!"></head><body><p>You'll be laughing at the wisecrack, deadpan humor between Agnes, (Ashley Judd), a cocaine snorting, booze guzzling bar waitress, living modestly with a hint of homespun ideals in a desert hole called The Rustic Motel, (picture a caricaturized Sheryl Crow with a beer ih her hand), and Peter, (Michael Shannon), a kind and homeless nerd she hooks up with who reveals a frightening smile of demented psychosis when you least want him to. Then you'll laugh, maybe inappropriately, as director William Friedkin turns, what burns steadily in the first half, as a tidy suspence thriller and evocative domestic drama, into a horrific assault on the senses, the way you would nervously laugh at Friedkin's "The Exorcist", when devil child Reagan informed you what your mother was doing in the afterlife. Not much happens in the first half, but danger lurks at every turn, and the involved drama of an abusive ex-husband returning home after a prison sentence, rivals the creeping suspense. "Bug" becomes a deliberately tacky and intellectual B-plus movie depicting helicopters and earthquakes bombarding a small motel (sort of), self inflicted body carvings, a dental root canal administered by the patient, and bedbugs the size of, well, bedbugs. Those nasty little bites can be maddening.<br /><br />It's a nightmarish diversion of fear and paranoia in modern culture. Not quite big enough to rival "The Exorcist", or cheap enough to be what you might expect from a horror film called "Bug". It's somewhere in between, playing out very much like the theatrical psychological drama, "Bug", by Tracey Lettes, it is based on. If the screenplay didn't include high-minded ideals, and topical horrific references, (many may see Iraq in all this), you would indeed have a horror film called "Bug". But when psyched-out bugman, Peter, covered in fresh gaping wounds, and tiny bug bites, screams The Jonestown Massacre was a cover-up administered by governing bodies, you momentarily think seriously about it. The film also offers a gripping performance by Ashley Judd, whose sad weary waitress begs for redemption, as she is surely on her way to meeting up with that big can of Raid.</p></body></html>

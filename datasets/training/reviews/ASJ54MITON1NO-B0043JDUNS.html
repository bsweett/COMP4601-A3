<meta name="summary" content="Iron Man 2, DVD."></head><body><p>If action is what you want Iron Man 2 has some good action sequences. This film wasn't that much different than the first film in quality or substance. It was basically everything that you would expect it to be, having seen the first film. Some of the characters' were even better in Iron Man 2, like Mickey Rourke and Scarlett Johansson who is always interesting to watch. The film itself makes it a point to entertain and that it does more like a comic book than some of the other super hero films. Obviously not reality but somewhat based upon reality in some way. Even Gary Shandling has a small part in the film playing a senator no less.</p></body></html>

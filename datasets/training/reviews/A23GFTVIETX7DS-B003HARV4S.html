<meta name="summary" content="A Gorgeous, Gripping Film about Love and Magic"></head><body><p>Based on Steven Millhauser's short story and set in early 20th century Vienna, The Illusionist captures what art house production companies do best -- stunning cinematography, an inventive tale, emotional resonance, excellent acting, and a cinematic magic that transcends the illusions in the plot itself.  Eisenheim the Illusionist (Edward Norton), the son of a carpenter who trained himself in the art of magic, has created a stir in Vienna when he arrives, seemingly out of nowhere, to charm the city with his spectacular illusions.  When the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) volunteers his soon-to-be fiancee as a subject in one of Eisenheim's most terrifying tricks, all starts going very wrong between the two men -- one a mere magician and carpenter's son and the other the most powerful man in the city.<br /><br />Ed Norton exudes mystery and charm as Eisenhem, but his is not the only memorable performance. Jessica Biel as Sophie, the woman of his dreams, is both sensuous and conflicted.  The chemistry between Norton and Biel is palpable, even if it may be too muted for some viewers.  Paul Giamatti's Inspector is likewise complex, both in his loyalty to the Crown Prince and in his personal fascination with Eisenheim.  The best part of this story is not the traditional themes of class division and love but rather the atmosphere of the period combined with dark illusions that suggest a Faustian deal with the devil and death.<br /><br />A first-rate film, The Illusionist is marred only by the occasional predictable plot elements.  Even if you guess the end, as I did, you'll enjoy every minute of watching it unfold.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p></body></html>

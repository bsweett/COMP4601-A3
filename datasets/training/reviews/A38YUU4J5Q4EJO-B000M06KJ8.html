<meta name="summary" content="I loved this movie !!"></head><body><p>The problem with period pieces is that people either love them or hate them. Me? I LOVE them! - and I loved this movie to pieces!!<br /><br />First off, this movie is just beautiful- just to LOOK at it!<br /><br />They did a wonderful job on the wardrobes, and all the settings, especially those of the inside of the palace, were just elegant and so..VICTORIAN :)<br /><br />I love all things Victorian, anyway and this movie is a treat for the eyes. All the eye popping COLORS were very pretty. The cinematography was the best,too.<br /><br />All this aside though, The story kept my attention throughout, and I thought the story to be very interesting.<br /><br />I think Kirsten Dunst did a wonderful job portraying Marie Antoinette.<br /><br />But, like I said, it is a love or hate it movie.<br /><br />I just happen to love period pieces. (especially around this era) and the biggest thing that sold me on this particular one was the beautiful scenery/wardrobe/use of brilliant colors<br /><br />I give it an A+  .</p></body></html>

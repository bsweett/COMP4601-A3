At once it was a laugh out loud, slap your mama funny movie and then it becomes this dull, worn out, drawn out and unfunny Saturday Night Live skit from the mid-90's.  In other words, when it is funny, it's very funny, but when it misses the mark, it misses by a good ol' country mile.<br /><br />Will Ferrell goofs his way through this flick in sometimes funny, but mostly annoying, fashion.  Christina Applegate wasted herself here.  The "newsteam" that backed up Ferrell was boring.  I have to admit, though, that they captured the oafishness and all out idiotic mentality of most reporters.  I've worked with a few in my day when I was at a local station, and the majority of them aren't half as great as they think they are.  Their egos are bloated well beyond capacity.<br /><br />The funniest parts of this film are when other stars make cameo appearances.  Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Vince Vaughn, and Luke Wilson all have wonderful bit parts that result in hilarity.  The gem of the bunch has got to be Jack Black.  His burrito-induced road rage resulting in a punted pooch is classic.<br /><br />I don't recommend purchasing this flick.  It's not silly enough to be considered "brainless" humor and it is entirely too idiotic to be intelligently funny.  However, the few gutbusters that are found here are worthy of at least one viewing.  Pick it up as a rental and then let fate take over from there.</p></body></html>

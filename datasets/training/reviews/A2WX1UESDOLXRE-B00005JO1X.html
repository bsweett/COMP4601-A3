<meta name="summary" content="SOOOO GOOD!"></head><body><p>This movie has the most outstanding visual effects. The animals look real. You will really think you're seeing a talking lion, talking beavers, centaurs, and dozens of other magical creatures. I read the books when I was really young; I can't say I remember them, but it was nice going into the film without any preconceived notions about what it SHOULD be, when what this movie IS is just a wonderful movie.<br /><br />The movie is about four children, all who are displaced from WWII, made to live with a professor in his giant house. They can't touch anything, run, shout, or disturb the professor. Lucy, the youngest child, says that hide-and-seek is a fairly quiet game, so all the kids proceed to play, with little Lucy running for cover when she finds a beautifully carved wardrobe. It's the only object in the entire room. She opens the door and hides within a bundle of coats. As she scoots back to hide herself a little more, she suddenly realizes: she's not in the wardrobe any more. She's in Narnia, where she meets a goofy half-man, half-goat creature. Of course, her siblings refuse to believe her, until all of them end up in Narnia as well.<br /><br />The plot is really intricate, that I don't want to go into it all. The point is that this is a really fantastic movie. That's all anyone ever really needs to know. It might be a little scary for small children, but any kid who can watch the Harry Potter flicks without flinching should be just find with this movie. You'll love the stunning the visuals and this simply magical story. So much more goes on this movie that I can't even seem to put into words. Yes, it's that good. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</p></body></html>

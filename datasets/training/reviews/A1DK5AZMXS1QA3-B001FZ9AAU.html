<meta name="summary" content="Should actually be Gold-Titanium Man"></head><body><p>Finally, a comic-book movie for the 21st century.  Our hero has his flaws; a passion for dumb women and an awkwardness with smart ones.  Our villain has a believable motive; greed, and represents a realistic threat to society, the military - industrial complex.  Iron Man also has a female sidekick who does know his true identity.  And best of all, our hero is not suffused with enough humility to keep his identity under wraps.  What a great movie!  The only flaws were some of the action scenes in which Iron Man takes quite a pounding.  Yes, the suit kept the man whole, but any person going thru those types of G-forces would suffer internal bleeding at a lethal level.</p></body></html>

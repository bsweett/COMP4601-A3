<meta name="summary" content="The best since the original, sadly brought down by clean language and stupid CGI"></head><body><p>I watched this recently on cable, and while that fact led me to initially (and erroneously) excuse the otherwise unforgivable truncation of the trademark Yippie-Kai-Yay exclamation, I still enjoyed this fourth entry in the vaunted Die Hard franchise.<br /><br />Bruce Willis as John McClane is back and believable as a senior detective more concerned with his college-aged daughter's boyfriend trouble. But what makes this movie in my opinion is Justin Long (from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNS4">Ed</a>," and the nerd from those Apple ads) completing the unlikely buddy duo. Timothy Olyphant is a little weak as the big boss, but Maggie Q picks up the slack and is BADA$$.<br /><br />So why only 3 stars? Well, as hinted at above, the language in this one is a little too clean. While I initially attributed this to a broadcast edit, the truth is even worse. All of the previous Die Hard films were rated R. In what I must assume was a misplaced effort to broaden the film's reach--as if people follow the guidelines, anyway!--this last entry was rated PG-13. The filmmakers reduced profanity, in some cases even muting dialogue post-production. As a result, McClane's climactic "Yippie-Kai-Yay, [f]other-[m]ucker!" packs less punch than the fat old guy from those Apple commercials.<br /><br />So DH4 loses a star there, and another for the truly unbelievable CGI toward the end of the film. (Especially the highway scene with the dueling semi and the F-35B. C'mon!) Let good actors act. Don't turn it into a cartoon! That scene almost killed the entire movie for me. You can get the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VNMMR0">Unrated</a> version, which will remedy the first issue, but sadly you cannot excise the CGI stupidity.</p></body></html>

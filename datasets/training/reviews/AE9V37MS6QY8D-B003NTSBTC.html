<meta name="summary" content="A thriller that's not as good as the book BUT comes awful close!"></head><body><p>I'm not as huge a fan as most movie critics are of Martin Scorcese, but I do enjoy his films and was excited when I viewed the trailer for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061703257">Shutter Island</a>, based on the novel by Dennis Lehane (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060584750">Mystic River</a>). And while I'm not the biggest Leonardo DiCaprio fan, I still consider him a good, serious actor.  And when I viewed the film, I was taken aback by Scorcese's cool visuals accompanied by a ridiculous score, which Scorcese and musician Robbie Robertson attempted to pull a "Tarantino" by mixing various style scores/compositions into scenes.  Unlike Quentin Tarantino's talent at this style, I found Scorcese and Robertson's picks to be completely out of place.  Whereas Tarantino scrounges every possible genre of music, this selection was still limited to music that had that cheesy 1950s horror film feel to it.  And I get why the filmmakers chose this music since the film does take place in 1954. However, the music becomes more of a distraction rather than a seamless, blending, artful, expressionistic character for filmmaking - the effect that any score should have on a film.<br /><br />All music aside, the film was good. The ending in no way lived up to the "twist-you'll-never-see-coming" status it was given by most movie critics and audiences, but it still was worthy of any mystery fan's money.  The acting is all spot-on with a great cast including Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams, Max von Sydow, Jackie Earle Haley, Patricia Clarkson, Emily Mortimer, Ted Levine, John Carroll Lynch, and Elias Koteas.  All of them great actors with very pivotal parts, yet, in my opinion, sadly, not used enough in the film. DiCaprio acts well enough but there is something slightly missing from this film, preventing it from being one of the year's best.<br /><br />I wish I could put my finger on what exactly is missing, but it's difficult to identify.  Scorcese pulls out all the stops and the filmmaking is sufficient, however, the story itself on celluloid is too outlandish and too pretentious.  The ending was open to interpretation but that's not what put me off - in fact, I liked the ending.  What put a bad taste in my mouth was the lack of explanation into how the entire surprising twist of a plotline could have been executed in the first place. For the sake of surprising the audience at the end, the filmmakers don't show or explain how our protagonist is placed in the position at the beginning other than simply alluding to a fact that the audience has to assume.  This may not sound like much to make the movie "so-so" but it is a big deal in terms of the story's progression, and should be treated as such. Also, being a father, I wasn't too crazy about the flashback scene involving kids.<br /><br />Nevertheless, "Shutter Island" does take a Hitchcockian twist and turns out a decent story. I am a fan of the novel's author, Dennis Lehane, because his stories are so cinematic and I love his attempt to mix film noir mystery with a period piece. And there are some movies based on books that although not as great as their literary companion are still great adaptations and worth watching (i.e., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4LPJ6">Battle Royale: Director's Cut (Collector's Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IYEQR4">Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785134352">Kick-Ass</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CLBJV4">High Fidelity</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MYIXAW">Let the Right One In [Blu-ray</a>]). However, this film unfortunately doesn't quite make that cut. If you've read the book, the movie will be somewhat of a disappointment only because the book (when it first came out and I read it) was so surprising and great. But, maybe that's the rub; if you read the book, there's almost no need to see this film 'cause most of the book was put on screen.  The movie's "Good" status -- rather than "Great" -- is not because of the acting or directing, which are both satisfactory - it's simply the adaptation.  Acting and directing: satisfactory; story structure: mediocre.<br /><br />Scorcese has always had an artistic take on film and moviemaking, whether he's shooting the grimy, grainy black-and-white world of a boxing ring, or the flashy, colorful casinos of the Vegas mob. He's an icon in the truest sense of the word. His take on Dennis Lehane's 1950s-set thriller is a new territory for him and he shoots it well. The story is a must for any noir mystery thriller fiction fan, but viewing the movie should only come after experiencing the ultimate "director's cut" -- the book.</p></body></html>

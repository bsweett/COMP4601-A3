<meta name="summary" content="Corny remake"></head><body><p>This was a lackluster and at times cheesy remake of Clash of the Titans which only loosely follows the myth of Perseus. In this version, Zeus imprisons his brother Hades, (for no real apparent reason),  in the underworld. Hades, obviously angry at this betrayal is the bad guy and seeks revenge on Zeus. A mortal king, Acrisius,lays siege to mount Olympus- just because I guess. Zeus, to teach him a lesson has sex with Acrisius's wife Danae- although since this is Zeus we are talking about he rarely needs any reason to shag anyone. Danae conceives Perseus. Enraged, the king kills his wife, but Perseus, being a demi-god, survives and is raised by a fisherman and his family.<br /><br />Perseus, (Sam Worthington) sporting a crewcut and a tunic, is adopted by a fisherman and lives an uneventful life troubled only by bouts of chest pains when it rains. Eventually his past catches up to him, and his family is killed in the crossfire by Hades.  Vowing revenge, Perseus decides to kill Hades to avenge his family. Together with a bland group of red shirt extras heroes, he agrees to help Andromeda to get revenge on Hades, (saving her life is just coincidental to his plan).<br /><br />What can I say? The film was not that great. Sam Worthington was a poor choice for Perseus. He looked far too modern. He is supposed to be a Greek, but he looks and acts like a secret service agent.. His acting was bland and unconvincing. Andromeda who is supposed to be prettier than Aphrodite seemed quite plain, and the inclusion of the giant scorpions as riding beasts was perhaps the cheesiest thing I have seen in a while.  I did like the portrayal of Medusa as beautiful. Most of the cast, except for Perseus just waits around for their turn to die and added very little to the overall plot.<br /><br />Overall, while this was watchable and the action enough to keep anyone from being bored, I thought the filmmakers were simply going through the motions. None of the characters really had any soul and alterations to the story which were made, such as: the silly anti-diety sentiment shared by Acrisius and Perseus, IO as a love interest, the scorpions etc. didn't really didn't add anything to the plot. This was a weak film which suffered from a poor screenplay, and screenwriter conceit. A better writer, and less deviation from the source material would've helped a lot.</p></body></html>

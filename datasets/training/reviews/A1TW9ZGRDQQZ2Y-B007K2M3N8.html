He sings very well (shocked me), acts very well (already knew this one), and dances good as well (had to see to believe). Kate Bosworth was beautiful as always and her acting held its own with Spacey. I never really heard of Bobby Darin (I didn't realize he sang the familiar "Dream Lover" and "Splish Splash") before viewing this film and now I feel as if I knew the guy in person. A true mark of a film worth viewing at least once.</p></body></html>

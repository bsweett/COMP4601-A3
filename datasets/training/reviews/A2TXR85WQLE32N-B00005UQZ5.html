<meta name="summary" content="The Fugitive Revisited..."></head><body><p>1993's "The Fugitive" stars Harrison Ford as the title character in a very worthwhile movie remake of the 1960's television series that starred David Janssen.<br /><br />As in the TV series, Dr. Richard Kimble (Ford) is falsely convicted of having murdered his wife but escapes from custody during a spectacular train wreck.  Kimble returns to Chicago to seek the one-armed man who really killed his wife, while trying to stay one step ahead of his relentless pursuer.  Tommy Lee Jones reprises the role of Gerrard, the obsessed detective of the TV series.  Kimble's search for the real killer will end in a dead heat with Gerrard's pursuit of the runaway doctor inside a Chicago hotel.<br /><br />Although obviously lacking the extended suspense of the four-year TV series, the movie captures the essential elements of its predecessor.  The Fugitive tracks the real killer through a thin string of clues. At the same time, he must stay on the move and off the grid to avoid his relentless police pursuer.  Along the way, his random acts of kindness for total strangers convince the viewer of his real innocence.<br /><br />Harrison Ford is entirely credible as the doctor on the run, in a more emotional portrayal than the stoic David Janssen.  Tommy Lee Jones as the pursuing U.S. Marshal is a more complete and sympathetic character than Barry Morse's grim, humorless rendition in the original series, enough so to rate a OSCAR and his own sequel (U.S. Marshals).<br /><br />The availability of modern special effects and the need to pack the story into a feature length movie makes for breathless pacing, as the Fugitive makes a series of spectacular escapes from the law, beginning with the train wreck that saves him from the death house.  Of necessity, Kimble's trail of clues is fairly intact and leads him fairly quickly to the one-armed man, and to an unsuspected and deadly conspiracy.<br /><br />Fans of the 1960's TV program will enjoy this well-done movie if they can handle the time compression; viewers arriving fresh to the story will find this a breathless and thrilling chase with a surprising ending.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Blu review only..."></head><body><p>I noticed the 440+ reviews here are for the film - not the Blu so I at least wanted to answer some common questions about this cut.<br /><br />The director's cut is 111 minutes with the already mentioned changes listed here and everywhere - including the removal of the beginning narration, more character development scenes, etc. The transfer looks phenomenal (compared to how I saw it prior - even upscaled). I played the title on both a Panasonic plasma and a Bravia via a 80 GB PS3 and Sony BDP301. I paused the film in over 34 spots of action, dark contrasts, bright colorings and various hue changes. Virtually every frame looked excellent, especially the scenes with Jennifer Connelly singing; the majority of the colorings were in her scenes until those last beach sequences.<br /><br />The special features are the same between the DVD and Blu with the exception of one of the commentaries. The 7.1 DTS HD sound was enjoyable, even though two of the channels were primarily used in the large machine sequences only.<br /><br />A worthwhile Blu addition and I did not see too many failings in the grain reduction/transfer issues I had read about.</p></body></html>

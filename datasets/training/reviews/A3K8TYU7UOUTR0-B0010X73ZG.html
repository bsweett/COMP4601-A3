The monsters in this film were designed by the great Bernie Wrightson, and they are terrifying, diverse and original. The effects were created with a combination of CGI AND models using stop-action animation, and they are really jaw-dropping. This combo of techniques raises the effects above the weightless CGI clutter seen in most films. This is one of the few films about which I can honestly say is worth watching for the special effects and the monsters.<br /><br />The Bad: All the bad that is inherent in Stephen King's novels - meaning cardboard characters and glaringly writerly dialogue; all which serve as a platform Mr. King's childish politics. The characters always feel like "types" and the dialogue he gives them always feels like sudden speeches out of the blue. Nothing ever, ever feels real or natural. With King, folks are very bad (meaning conservative or religious) or very good (meaning liberal and vaguely undeclared religiously). His heroes are always full of jibes and speeches contemptuous of politics, the "govment," and any remotely organized religion. His villains are always quoting the Bible (usually from the Book of Revelations), work for the United States Government/Military, or are intolerant rural (always rural) racists. He also likes to throw in a "strong, independent woman", usually middle aged, completely non-sexual, with a heavy, Maine/northeastern accent, in every novel for good measure.<br /><br />The Ugly: Without giving up the end, suffice to say it is an ending done by a filmmaker determined at any cost to have a shocking ending. I dislike a tacked-on happy ending as much as the next person, and so much of king is soaked in sugar, but this film's conclusion is ugly just for the sake of ugliness.So ugly, in fact, it left me wondering if perhaps the filmmaker was telling us the "crazy" zealot was right all along: perhaps the mist really is a God wrought punishment, and God really is the vengeful Old Testament God, pointing his bloody finger at, well, who exactly? The brave and the liberal? A confused, cheap-shot ending, to say the least.<br /><br />Recommended for the monsters (who seem better scripted than the humans) and nothing else. --Mykal Banta<br /><br />Post-script: It seems the near fatal auto accident that Mr. King suffered seems to have completely upset him in some troublesome ways. The author now finds it perfectly acceptable to have his "good guys" shoot those characters he doesn't like in the face, at close range, in cold blood. There is, of course, the obligitory explainations of "having no choice," but this is nonsense. None of Stephen King's heros seems to understand the concept of a warning or wounding shot, which in the situation depicted in the film would have had devastating effect. Perhaps this was a filmmaker's addition, but none the less, post-accident King seems to revel in ugly brutality in ways pre-accident King would not have. Has the Liberal King become so bankrupt of ideas that killing is the only solution?</p></body></html>

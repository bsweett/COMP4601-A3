<meta name="summary" content=""She's So HEAVY!" ~ When The World Changed Forever"></head><body><p>I found the '07 release `Across the Universe' to be a nostalgic, enjoyable film that beautifully highlights the songs of the greatest rock/pop group of the twentieth century and beyond. The cast is thoroughly likeable, the cameos excellent, especially Bono and Joe Cocker, and the storyline and visuals pure `60's.<br /><br />There are numerous levels of thought and genres from which one can approach this film. It's a musical, a period piece, a cultural/political statement, a love story and a poignant coming of age tale. Remarkably it succeeds on all levels. Put on your walrus outfit and give it a try.<br /><br />My Rating: -4 ? Stars-.</p></body></html>

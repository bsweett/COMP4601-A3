Therefore, I have no plans to compare this version with the original.  Instead, I'll look at this flick for what it is:  average Hollywood entertainment.  Nicolas Cage plays Edward Malus, a policeman who tries to help a young woman and her daughter only to see a terrible thing happen to them.  As he recovers from the bizarre event, he receives a letter from an old flame who says that her daughter has been kidnapped and she desperately needs his help.  Being an honest, well-meaning man, Malus takes a trip out to Summersisle, where his ex-fiance, Willow, lives.  Once there, Malus encounters a bizarre pagan cult that puts fertility and death on pedestals via annual festivals.  The cult is made up primarily of women with a few men on the island to do handiwork.  Malus believes that the cult has taken Willow's daughter for some sort of ritual and sets out to prove it.  For those unfamiliar with the conclusion of the original, the ending may be a bit of a shocker.<br /><br />Like others have stated, the acting is a little iffy.  Cage puts in a decent performance, but his antics sometime border on slapstick.  Leelee Sobieski has a minor role as one of the sisters in the cult.  Her performance is pretty good.  Kate Beahan portrays Willow.  She turns in one of the weaker performances in the movie.  Molly Parker is fun as Sister Rose and her twin sister.  The biggest letdown in the flick is the performance of Ellen Burstyn.  Her loopy, feminist Sister Summersisle adds a new dimension of cheesiness when she makes her appearance.<br /><br />With all of that said I still believe that "The Wicker Man" at least deserves a rental.  It isn't as terrible, in my opinion, as much of the rest of today's remakes or even originals for that matter.  It's not going to win any big awards, but it is a decent way to kill one-and-a-half hours of a rainy day.<br /><br />It's a rental, nothing more, nothing less.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE MONSTER MASH..."></head><body><p>This is an action-packed film that crosses a number of genres: horror, comedy, and adventure. It has a stellar cast and a fairly interesting story line. It also has some stupendous special effects but therein lies the rub. The director has not learned that less is often more. Some of the special effects are spectacular and some are buffoonish/cartoonish and end up being jarring, rather than enhancing, to the film.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is excellent as Van Helsing, the mysterious monster killer who is subsidized by the Catholic Church, as the Vatican operates  a secret laboratory run by clergymen who perfect sophisticated weaponry for Van Helsing's fight against evil. In 1887, Van Helsing is sent by the Vatican to assist the noble Valerious family of Transylvania in getting rid of the pesky Count Vladislaus Dracula, drolly played by Richard Roxburgh. By the time Van Helsing arrives, accompanied by his trusty sidekick, a friar named Carl (David Wenham), the only member of this vampire fighting family who is left alive is the athletic and lovely Anna Valerious, played with single-minded dedication by the  wasp-waisted, newly Barbie breasted Kate Beckinsale.<br /><br />There, they all end up battling the brides of Dracula, a werewolf, and Count Dracula himself, with a little assist from Frankenstein. Let the games begin! The flying brides of Dracula are my favorite special effects, but even there the production cannot refrain from being unsubtle, which is too bad. There are some scenes that are spectacular, such as the battle between the werewolf and Anna and her brother, Velkan (Will Kemp), which takes place before the arrival of Van Helsing. Those special effects are terrific, as are those involving the brides of Dracula upon Van Helsing's arrival in Transylvania and the subsequent battle between them.<br /><br />The film also manages to blend a certain amount of humor and camp, making it quite funny, at times, and somewhat tongue-in-cheek. As for the romance between Van Helsing and Anna, I am sorry to report that there is little, if any, chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Moreover, the film is consistently uneven. While the opening black and white scene in which the towns people, carrying torches,  converge upon Count Dracula's castle is very atmospheric, its effect is vitiated by the ludicrous scene immediately following in which Van Helsing  battles Mr. Hyde (of Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde fame). Unfortunately, Mr. Hyde resembles nothing more than a video game monster similar to the Hulk, minus the green hue.<br /><br />Despite some of the issues with the film, it is definitely an entertaining, action-packed film that is worth a rental.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A classic movie which sounds DTS great!"></head><body><p>This movie is a classic and the mother of all sea animals vs. humans.  Sure there has been movies about killer whales, big snakes and other movies with sharks and also other &quot;JAWS&quot; movies but the first movie will always be regarded as the best out there right now.  <p>This 25th Anniversary DVD was one of the most highly anticipated DVD's out there.  Of course, there was a debate because although the movie won an Academy for best sound, purists cried foul when they heard the movie would be released in DTS and Digital Dolby instead of Mono.  Well, I prefer to watch my DVD's in the best sound as possible including this movie and thus the DTS version is the way to go.  You literally feel that you are swimming in the beach with the splashes heard all around you.  It's awesome!  So, the audio is great and the movie looks pretty good despite the fact that it has been 25 years.<p>Also, this DVD is packed!  You get the documentary of &quot;The Making of Jaws&quot;, deleted scenes, outtakes, storyboards and so much more that this DVD will keep you busy for the weekend.<p>A highly recommended DVD!</p></body></html>

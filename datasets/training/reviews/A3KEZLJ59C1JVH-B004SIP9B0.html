Prime Minister Tony Blair (played brilliantly by Michael Sheen) had just recently been elected at the time of Diana's death, and he was still in the process of determining the best way to forge a successful working relationship with the queen. This film deals with Windsor's fall from grace the week after Diana's death, when the queen refused to follow the prime minister's advice on how to best handle the situation to meet the needs of the grieving British public.<br /><br />At first the queen refuses to take Blair's advice about making any kind of public statement, preferring to remain silent in hopes that the former Princess of Wales would be laid to rest quickly and quietly, without any fanfare. However, the public's frustration grows and Elizabeth faces opposition from the government as well as from her son Charles (Alex Jennings). Soon it becomes clear that the royal family's inaction may wind up being their ultimate demise, and the queen is forced to come to terms with her own emotions and make one of what was surely many difficult choices during her reign.<br /><br />I think this film is brilliant. The cast is absolute perfection, and it's very clear why Mirren received an Oscar for her portrayal as a queen struggling to come to terms with her own personal beliefs and the realization that she doesn't always understand the needs of her people. I also appreciated the way the film handled the treatment of Diana herself. Although the plot of the movie revolves around Diana's death, it's handled gracefully and with dignity. Instead of casting an actress to play the princess, the film relied on a steady peppering of news clips showing the real Diana herself, which was thoughtful and effective.<br /><br />On one hand, "The Queen" depicts a monarchy that is cold and completely out of touch with modern day society. However, although I didn't always agree with Elizabeth's choices, it was easy to sympathize with her position and understand where she was coming from when she made certain decisions. Regardless of her personal feelings toward the late princess, the queen's belief that quiet dignity should be maintained before caving in to public spectacle is a very good point.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to everyone, if for no other reason than that Mirren portrays Elizabeth II with more humanity than most people might believe is possible. This is truly an excellent film.</p></body></html>

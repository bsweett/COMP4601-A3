John is supposedly in construction while Jane is supposedly in computer maintenance.  Their secret lives are much different.  They each thought the marriage would provide good cover for their own covert actions but are now going to a marriage counselor.  We get a good look at how they started together and how they got where they are.  Then they are both hired for the same hit and get in each others way.  Now they each have forty-eight hours to eliminate the other before their companies eliminate them.<br /><br />They manage to track each other down and are surprised to learn their spouse is now what they thought.  A misunderstanding then drives them into a series of maneuvers where they keep trying to kill one another.  But all of this give each of them a chance to explore what their feelings really are for each other.  Honesty begins to be a part of their communication and things get more complex.  As the relationships build so does the action until everything is neatly wrapped up.<br /><br />This is not another True Lies although there are some obvious similarities.  The therapy framework as well as the flashbacks and humor help make the film unique and not a retreatment of old ideas.  The change in personas between the real and the cover personalities is also very well done and believable.  This helps cement the rest of the film.  All in all a good film that works well as an action film and as a romantic film.  Check it out.</p></body></html>

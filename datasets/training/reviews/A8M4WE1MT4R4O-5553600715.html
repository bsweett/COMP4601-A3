<meta name="summary" content="Ghost World"></head><body><p>A fantastic film with extrodinary acting by all the actors.  I have gained alot of respect for Nicole Kidman, she is addicting to watch, and her intelligence is apparent when watching her act through scenes.  Above all else, I was especially impressed with the acting of the two children in the film.  Where do they find these kids?  They were remarkable.  &quot;The Others&quot; is a creepy, spine tingling film that gave me chills all over.  I watched it at night by myself and I was freaked out.  When Nicole finally opens the book of the dead, I was horrified.  This movie goes way beyond Casper the Friendly Ghost, beware.......</p></body></html>

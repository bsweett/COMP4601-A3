<meta name="summary" content="Very Sly, but PC God at Work"></head><body><p>This film is a denunciation of generational excess.  The film spotlights some of the traumatic disasters and cultural phenomenon, the curious history of the 60's and 70"s, a watershed for boomer youth; God help us; it has marked us all.<br /><br />I guess if your top button is buttoned and your pants are hitched up, and if your hair is cut severely, then you have the Tom Hanks look for a Southern fellow that's mentally deficient, though he can run fast enough.  I agree with other reviewers, it's a Tom Hanks career highlight.  He is the good-hearted bumpkin that bumbles his way with honor.  The plot juxtapositions Hanks solid, folksy morals versus raw evil or angry ambiguity.  He knows there is his mother and there is a God.  That is powerful life-fulfilling fuel.<br /><br />In contrast, Forrest's childhood friend Jenny is lost.  Robin Wright plays the sexually abused cracker's daughter.  She's plenty smart and is perceptive enough to realize that Gump is a sweet friend, loyal.  However, she's on the run most of her life, drugs and 60's rock and roll and then LA and disco coke parties.  Naturally, after each of her prodigal returns to Forrest, she loves him physically, but she cannot love spiritually.  She does not find peace till she exorcises her lifestyle demons, seeking comfort in Forrest's arms; then there's the bittersweet finale.<br /><br />To booster my theory, Gary Sinese as Gump's Vietnam Lt, loses his legs in battle.  Gump wins the Medal of Honor by saving his platoon and Sinese too.  Lt. Dan is from a military family and is bitter that he has lost his legs rather than dying heroically.  Again and again, Sinese's post-Vietnam life is in turmoil as he is flabbergasted by Gump's successes.  The good Lt.is bitter in his cups.  Later in the shrimp boat storm scene, Sinese finds the Secular Hollywood God; literally he is baptized.  (Does Sinese really have legs or not.  Amazing special effect or they used an actor with stumps.  Ya got me?)<br /><br />Yes, there is a religious message:we are ruled by destiny and we float in the air like a feather simultaneously,an obvious Christian message that is never spoken as the PC crowd grapples with eternity.</p></body></html>

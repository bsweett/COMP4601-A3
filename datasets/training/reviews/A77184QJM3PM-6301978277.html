Recently voted the funniest American film ever in AFI's poll of the 100 Funniest Movies, it never fails to entertain. The pairing of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon is pure magic. Each may not have been Billy Wilder's first choice for their respective roles, but one cannot imagine anybody else playing them now. As for Marilyn Monroe, she is the fragile, beautiful heart of the entire film. Her Sugar Kane is tragic, funny, sexy, and adorable all at the same time. I read how some of her lines had to be written out and displayed for her to read out while filming, and somehow this doesn't take away at all from her performance. She WAS Sugar Kane, always reaching for but not quite getting the sweet end of the lollipop. Jack Lemmon almost takes the entire movie as Daphne, his female alter-ego. How subversive this movie must have seemed in 1959, when a top male star could be seen reveling in his feminine side! As with "Sunset Boulevard" and "A Foreign Affair", the true strength of the film is the cast. Each person was letter perfect in their role. All of Billy Wilder's films should be essential viewing for any film buff. What he had was a true eye for talent in his acting roles, demontrated again and again in all his films, the knack for knowing who to put in what role. How many potentially great films have been hampered by questionable casting? It is a true gift, and not many really have it. This truly set Billy Wilder apart, and helped him turn this outrageous story into the classic it is now. Get this film for your collection, you won't regret it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I had to watch it twice."></head><body><p>I really shouldn't have admitted that but some movies just don't sink in the first go around with me.<br />"Let The Right On In" was one of those movies.<br />I've been a huge fan of "Interview With The Vampire" for many years and in my mind, that really is THE definitive vampire movie.<br />So, my first impressions of "LTROI" weren't spectacular.<br />I thought it was boring, drab and pardon the pun...lifeless.<br />So, after debating this movie with a friend a while ago. I decided to watch it again.<br />And.....<br /><br />I think I missed a lot of the subtle things that the movie offers.<br />You know, I went from writing sentence long reviews to writing reviews that bordered on "phone book" size.<br />I'm trying to get to somewhere in between the two.<br /><br />What did I like?<br />Beautiful direction.<br />Colorless and drab environments that really are a reflection of the vampire herself.<br />The acting itself was top notch.<br />My favorite scene is near the end, the hospital scene.<br />I won't spoil it but it was the coolest scene in the movie.<br /><br />What didn't I like upon the second viewing?<br />Not much.<br />Like I said, sometimes a movie just doesn't click with me the first time around.<br />The second time was a charm.<br />I don't know if the subtitles on my version were screwed up or not, I never saw the theater version.<br />All in all, it's a great movie and one of the few vampire movies that is a genuinely great addition to vampire lore.<br />"Let The Right On In" comes......<br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

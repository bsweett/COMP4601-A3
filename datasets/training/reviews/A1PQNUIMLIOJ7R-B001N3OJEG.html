Kevin Spacey is always good, but you'll see better Spacey roles in K-PAX, American Beauty, The Usual Suspects, Seven, Outbreak, and pretty much ANYTHING else with him! He certainly wasn't bad in L.A. Confidential, he just didn't stand out so much. Russell Crowe was fine in this as well. He has certainly improved his performance though with The Insider, Gladiator, and A Beautiful Mind. Guy Pearce was great in this, and he delivered the finest performance of the film. His better roles are Memento and The Count of Monte Cristo. Danny DeVito was his typical self. He is never a let down, but his better roles range from Matilda to Batman Returns to Hoffa. And then there's Kim Basinger. I LOVE Kim Basinger, but I have absolutely no idea why she won an Academy Award for this. I would have thought that this was one of her worse performances. Watch anything else with her, and her acting will stand out more than this! She was up against Minnie Driver's performance in Good Will Hunting for the award, and Driver was far more deserving of the award. Don't get me wrong, L.A. Confidential was a fine movie with fine performances, it just was not Oscar-worthy in any way. It wasn't amazing. It isn't a kid movie, and its R rating reflects violence, language, and some brief sexual images. This was fine to watch once.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great performances, a topical movie for uncertain times"></head><body><p>I'll be the first to admit that I've never seen the first Manchurian Candidate made in 1962, or even heard of the novel by Richard Condon, so I viewed this remake without any preconceived notions. The first thing that struck me about this movie is how relevant and topical the subject matter is, especially in times of multicolored terror alerts. The themes of media manipulation, the corruption of power, and the perversion of democracy are all woven into a tightly knit thriller that steadily pulls the viewer in. The Manchurian Candidate is a chilling account of what results when political and technological power converges and is used for the wrong reasons. The idea that private interests can rule government, that research regarding brain science can be used for harm rather than good, and that vast conspiracies can ensure that the public are kept ignorant and uninformed, are all urgently, and incontrovertibly relevant today.<br /><br />The movie centers on Sergeant Raymond Prentiss Shaw (Liev Schreiber), a Desert Storm veteran and current Congressman who is competing for the U.S. Vice Presidency. Shaw, if elected, will be the first vice-presidential candidate created solely for use by the private sector.  A private corporation called Manchurian Global is investing in him and is backed by the prestigious reputation of his family name. Raymond's ever-present, media-friendly mother, Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw (Meryl Streep), is a driven, egoistic and self-absorbed politician with a corrupt nature that will do anything to have her son elected to the White House. But Raymond's actions are perhaps driven not by his own motivations to be a good public servant, but from the brainwashing he underwent while serving in Kuwait.<br /><br />Major Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) is the paranoid leader of Sergeant Shaw's unit in Desert Storm. Marco has never really mentally recovered from his traumatizing experiences overseas. Plagued by devastating nightmares, he embarks in a quest to discover whether there's any truth behind these unsettling dreams. As the pieces of the puzzle come together, Marco discovers that the nightmares are from the effects of brainwashing, rather than from Gulf War Syndrome as was previously thought. Everyone surrounding Shaw does not want to discuss what happened in Desert Storm and even Shaw admits that he doesn't remember performing the heroic acts that handed him a Medal of Honor. As the mystery expertly unfolds, Marco comes to suspect that he and his men were brainwashed in order to place a sleeper into the White House that could one day, potentially, bring about the end of American democracy, as we know it.<br /><br />The Manchurian Candidate is an actor's movie, and it's refreshing to see three of the finest actors working today delve into their roles with passion and veracity. Streep gives probably the most disturbing and creepy performance. She brings a possibly incestuous, morally evil, surely demented mother, to electrifying life. Live Schreiber gives a well-modulated, unemotional and often scary performance that makes one question his true loyalties. Denzel brings a depth of character and a range of emotion that one has come to expect from the actor, and Kimberly Elise is excellent and suitably spunky as Rosie in a crucial role. Viewers will be treated to a great story and a very well acted movie when they see the Manchurian Candidate. This is probably one of the best movies of the year so far, and is definitely one of the most affecting, disturbing, and powerful political thrillers of the past few years.

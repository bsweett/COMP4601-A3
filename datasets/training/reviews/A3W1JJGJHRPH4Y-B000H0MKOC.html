There were a few misplays. The kidnapping was just strange and I am not sure how that explained anything.<br /><br />There is another review talking about smoking in the movie. I disagree. After the first few minutes, I noticed there was no smoking. I started to play close attention. There was very little or no smoking in the movie. Ebert comments on the same observation in his review. Again, the movie is poking fun at lobbyists. Everyone knows smoking is bad for you. What's the point of spoofing the tobacco industry?<br /><br />My favorite part in the movie was the debate about the MOD (ministers of death) squad about who caused more deaths: smoking, drinking or guns. Another good point is the father/son relationship. The son knows his father is hated by everybody, but his father is very good at what he does, which is talking. The father doesn't apologize for what he does, except, maybe at the very end. The son respects his father's decisions.<br /><br />The movie is not perfect, but it made me laugh and made me think about lobbyists, senate committees and our inadequacies and strengths of our political system.</p></body></html>

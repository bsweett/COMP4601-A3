<meta name="summary" content="Since I didn't hate this movie, I guess that makes me in the minority of reviewers here"></head><body><p>I don't think this is a particularly strong movie and it has a lot of gaps and hole in it . My bias? I"m a sucker for Shyamalan's work and I don't expect it to flow in a logical, plot-driven way. Some of his movies seem more like dreams that continue to evolve, sometimes to their darkest levels, and are played out in "real" life, but with a certain poetic quality.<br /><br />This movie is along those lines. Is it believable? Up to a point. People are worried about the environment but could an event, so self-limiting, actually happen? To fall under the director's spell, I think viewers need to suspend their sense of reality and accept the mystery and danger of life.<br /><br />In any case, I did enjoy this movie and found it evocative. 107 other people here on Amazon did not. So I dutifully note that I'm in the minority and may not be able to view Shyamalan's movies with objectivity. He speaks to those who believe that mysterious and even unseen forces could be at work in the world. I don't necessarily believe it but I can be creeped out enough by the thought when watching his movies</p></body></html>

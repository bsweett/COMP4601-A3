<meta name="summary" content="The Shining"></head><body><p>Frustrated writer Jack Torrance takes a job as the winter caretaker at the ominous, mountain-locked Overlook Hotel so that he can write in peace. When he arrives there with his wife and son, they learn that the previous caretaker had gone mad. Slowly Jack becomes possessed by the evil, demonic presence in the hotel. The Shining is a perfect example of how a horror movie should be made. It moves along at an even pace & takes you into the hotel of horror where the dead still live. This movie is chilling to the bone.</p></body></html>

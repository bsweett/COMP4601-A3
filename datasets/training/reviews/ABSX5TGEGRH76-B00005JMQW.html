Fortunately, Sam Raimi, Tobey McGuire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco were able to not only spellbind us again, but this film far surpassed the orginal Spider-Man, which was no easy feat.<br />Two years after the events of the first film, Peter Parker (McGuire) is down and out; he is losing his friends, his jobs, and and grades are quickly declining.  The cause for all this is because of his escapades as Spider-Man.  He can never keep an appointment with Mary-Jane Watson (Dunst), the woman he loves, and this drives her away.  His friend Harry Osborne (Franco) can't stand the fact that he has more loyalty to Spidey than to him.  Harry believes that Spidey killed his father, Norman Osbourne (Willem Dafoe), who, unbeknownst to Harry, was the Green Goblin.<br />Meanwhile, Harry is funding a project being researched by an eminent scientist, Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), which will create a new, cheap, almost never-ending energy source.  Sadly, things go wrong (surprise surprise), and Otto gets four mechanical arms fused onto his back, and they have minds of their own.  They begin to "suggest" that he do things, like start the project again, rob banks, and kill people.<br />Finally, after losing his friends and most of his jobs, Peter throws away his Spidey suit, vowing never to be Spider-Man again.  This of course opens up New York to a rapidly increasing crime rate.<br />All of the actors did a superb job in this film.  Dunst, Franco, Rosemary Harris (playing Aunt May), and J.K. Simmons (playing the hilarious J. Jonah Jameson) all got bigger roles, and even Cliff Robertson (Uncle Ben) and Willem Dafoe got small cameo roles.  The story remained strong, especially for a comic book film, and the effects were amazing.  This is definitely the ideal summer film.</p></body></html>

First it's really the first gay love story (if you want to call it a love story) to go mainstream, second it's got two pulitzer prize winners and Ang Lee involved, third it's got the best acting I have ever seen on film, and when you mix everything together you get the most professional adaptation of a written work I wouldn't want to say ever done, but it certainly might be.<br /><br />You probably know the story by now, so I won't go on with plot summeries, but I will tell you what made me attend this film 4 times at the theater:<br /><br />As an English major this movie was like literary heaven. After the first time I watched it I was blown away by all the foreshadow, symbolism, parallels, and poetric transitions that this film did perfectly. For instance, Jack always misses what he "shoots" (coyote, deer) but Ennis hits them. In a sense Ennis has "hit" Jack, but Jack can never really "hit" Ennis.<br /><br />At the end of one scene Alma throws down mail and the camera captures an ad for Honey. In the next seen Jack says "Honey" to his wife. What a great Poetic transition!<br /><br />There are many parallels, most notably that embrace from behind. Jack and Ennis do it twice, once while in the motel and another during the flashback when Jack is "sleeping like a horse." Alma also embraces Ennis from behind in the first bedroom scene when she wants to move into town. Even the their two shirts together in the end can be considered an embrace from behind.<br /><br />Jack foreshadows his outcome by wearing purple in one scene.<br /><br />I could go on and on and on with all the fun English and Literary goodies I found by watching the movie--trust me, I took pen and paper into the theater and filled up 5 front-and-back pages of notes. But I think I can summerize how I feel about this film by simply saying it is outstanding, and will always be considered Best Picture no matter what the Oscars have to say.</p></body></html>

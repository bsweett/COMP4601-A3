<meta name="summary" content="Veiled Chinese nationalism, but beautifully veiled"></head><body><p>This movie takes place around the time of Chinese unification, where many provinces were forced through war to come together.  Loosely based on a story from around that time, a Nameless warrior played by Jet Li slays three enemies of the state and presents their swords to the emperor.  Narrated by the Emperor of Qin (strongest emperor of pre-Modern China) and Nameless, the plot is based around Nameless's three fights.  However, simplicity is thrown out as the Emperor questions to see if that is Nameless's true motive.<br /><br />The story plays in a decently complex fashion as we travel with the words of Nameless or the Emperor to events that either were or might have been depending on Nameless's honesty.  However, at heart there is more to this story than just that, because each of Nameless's adventures (real or unreal) tell tales of sacrifice and love, for people and for nations.<br /><br />The usage of colors was spectacular and made the fight scenes that much more beautiful.  The only lack luster component of the film to me is that now almost all of the fighting seems like "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" all over again.  That was novel then, but not so novel now.<br /><br />Overall though, I still really appreciated the story.  I especially found it fascinating how the story wound around Nameless's intentions for seeing the Emperor.<br /><br />(This movie was inspired by a strong sense of nationalism, maybe for what China was like then as compared to now.  That is still a strong component though and whether you liked the movie or not it is still important to acknowledge the underlying them of patriotism for China.)</p></body></html>

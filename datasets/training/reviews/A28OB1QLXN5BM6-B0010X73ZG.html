Oops. No such luck. Instead I found myself in a Stephen King movie, which was quite fine by me. I've enjoyed several of Stephen Kings other books and films including The Stand, Stand By Me, The Tommyknockers, and even the Langoliers, but I had never read this one. It begins with an inside joke where an artist is painting a movie poster for a Stephen King novel and has other famous movie posters displayed as if he had painted them. We meet the family, the neighbor, and soon, half the town. And then THE MIST rolls in.<br /><br />Most of THE MIST takes place in a supermarket and most of the movie is typical Stephen King. We get to know a group of ordinary people who start to show their true colors as the pressure mounts. And the pressure mounts, you betcha! We have all sorts of creatures coming out of the mist to eat our frugal shoppers. But we also have our very own annoying humans inside the store, including an "unstable" Christian woman who constantly preaches her own version of the Bible and the end-of-days. As the movie progresses, we lose more shoppers until... I can't give away the ending, but I do have to talk about the ending. It's a very bad ending. And, apparently, it wasn't Stephen King's original ending. It's an ending that belongs in a different kind of movie, not a jump-out-of-the-mist-and-go-boo! movie. I mean, THE MIST is a modern B-Movie, and we all have certain expectations that go along with those. For instance, when the boy and girl make out, we know they're the next to die. Check. When anyone smiles or think they've made it, they're about to die in a particularly gruesome way. Check. And when our heroes risk everything to put an end to what's been dogging them, we expect ... well, we know what we expect and that box was definitely left unchecked.<br /><br />If it weren't for the ending, I'd have gladly given THE MIST higher marks for knowing that it was a Saturday matinee monster movie. Unfortunately, at the very last minute, it tried to be something more important, which is exactly what I did not want.<br /><br />Stephen King himself is quoted as saying, "The ending is such a jolt--wham! It's frightening. But people who go to see a horror movie don't necessarily want to be sent out with a Pollyanna ending." Well, this person does!</p></body></html>

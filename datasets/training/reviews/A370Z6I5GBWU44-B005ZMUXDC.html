When I first heard of this film, I was wondering why Rapunzel's hair would keep Mother Gothel young, since I was familiar with the original tale and how Rapunzel came into the custody of the witch. However, it's explained nicely in this film with the golden flower and Rapunzel's parents.<br /><br />Rapunzel is cute. She has a lot of skills from living alone for so long, although I wish the animators didn't give her such huge eyes, it threw me off a bit.</p></body></html>

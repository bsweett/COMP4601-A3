<meta name="summary" content="Not as Good"></head><body><p>The sequel is not as good as the original, but it has a lot of action and brings you up to date. Is there going to be another? Could be, but not clearly so. The acting is decent, the filming is good, the car chases are classic old school. Good filler film.</p></body></html>

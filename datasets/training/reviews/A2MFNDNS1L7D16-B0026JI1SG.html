As good an actor as Clint Eastwood has become he has mastered the other side of the camera also. He just doesn't make bad movies. I don't see Hillary Swank as a movie star, just a damn fine actress. One of the best. What can you say about Morgan Freeman? He just gives great narration. I put off seeing this movie because of the subject matter. Not only another boxing movie, but girl boxing. I'd be hard pressed to think of a more misbegotten sport. No matter. Boxing's not the point, (it rarely is) it's merely the vehicle. I felt the movie was about pursuing dreams, & facilatating the dreams of others when you can. It's about taking chances, opening youself up to different options, the ability to adapt & change. A solid four.</p></body></html>

I never expected this to be very funny when I started watching it. The sight gags really work, and the same is said for the humor itself (even though some of it involves people repeatedly getting hit by something). Vaughan, Stiller, Torn, and the rest of the cast really give hysterical performances. But why the four stars? Well, the only flaw here is that certain scenes do seem to slow the film down. But that's about it. The rest of the film is very good. It's a comedy that people with a real sense of humor will enjoy.</p></body></html>

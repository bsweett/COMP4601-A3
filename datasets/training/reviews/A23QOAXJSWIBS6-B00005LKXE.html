<meta name="summary" content="Falls well short of &quot;Lambs&quot; with gratuitous terror"></head><body><p>I was disappointed in this film, though it is not entirely  awful.  It misses the uniquely gripping feel of &quot;Lambs&quot; and devolves into scenes of fright and terror meant to shock and revulse in the worst, gratutious way.  Hopkins' performance seems thinner in some spots but almost a caricature of his Oscar-winning performance in others.  Moore holds her own, but I think the film suffers from the producers' presupposition that no matter what they put on screen would benefit from the critical and popular acclaim afforded the first film.  It doesn't happen here.  This film is clearly &quot;off-note.&quot;  I didn't find myself caring more for any of the characters in this chapter.  I couldn't wait until it was over.  Not one I am likely to watch again.</p></body></html>

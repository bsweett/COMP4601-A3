Maybe not immediately after you just watched it. The subject matter is hard to swallow as it is depressing, but just so beautifully and brilliantly portrayed. The characters are all doomed and there is nothing you can do but sit back and watch them spiral out of control. Requiem, in addition to an incredible cast, features outstanding cinematography reminiscent of Drugstore Cowboy (and if you look at my review for Drugstore Cowboy, I think I mentioned something along those lines) but I'm happy to see that kind of inspiration shine through so successfully in another film. To me, one of the most touching scenes in this movie is when Harry's mother gets taken to the hospital for her diet/speed pill addiction and her friends from the apartments come to visit her. When they show the friends outside on the bench, crying and hugging, every single time I see it, I cry. Everyone in this movie does such an amazing job at making this seem very, very real and anything but a dream. Don't miss this movie! If I could, I'd give it 10 stars.</p></body></html>

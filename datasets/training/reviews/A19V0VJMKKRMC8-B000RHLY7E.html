Rob Zombie made a step up from the original. This is the continuing saga of the Firefly family. Otis , Captain Spaulding , and Baby are back and ready for a rumble. R.I.P. Matthew Mc Grory. Mother was in this for a few scenes in the beginning and middle. Are the charectors as annoying this time? No.</p></body></html>

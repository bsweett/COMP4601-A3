<meta name="summary" content="Man, I so wanted to give this 2 stars..............."></head><body><p>I really was going to give Dark Water 2 stars, but looking back and after arguing with my wife (She really liked it) it's not too bad. I think what swayed me to the 3 star side was the acting, all who are in it do quite well, no over-acting, and with a couple of scene stealers. It seems Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) is in the middle of a tense custody battle with her ex, he wants her to move closer to him so they can have joint custody, while she wants to move farther away in the city because it's cheaper. She wins (at first) and her and her daughter move to a dumpy, dreary, run-down apartment building in lower Manhattan. Just so happens there was a little girl who was abused and mis-treated by her parents who eventually died, that lived in the apartment right above Dahlia's. Her ghost is not pleased, and soon takes after Dahlia's daughter as the two of them look identical, and she also wants Dahlia to be her new mother.<br /><br />The first 45 minutes are really boring, it takes the movie way too long to get going, but when it does, the last 45 minutes are pretty entertaining. Also, this movie is way to dark, there is little lighting to speak of, and what lighting there is does the viewer no good cuz' you can't see a thing!! I know dark scenes are important to a horror/mystery movie, but not overkill, okay? And of course this got the dreaded 'unrated' tag, which if you have read any of my previous reviews, you know I'm not a big fan of.........at all.<br /><br />As I said earlier, the cast is strong, Connelly plays Dahlia well, a strong, loving mother, but with so many past demons, a brutal custody battle, and her daughter's imaginary friend, she slowly loses control and begins to question her own sanity. John C. Reilly plays Mr. Murray, the owner of the building who talks Dahlia and her daughter into moving in. He is kind of a sleaze but helps Dahlia out in getting her apartment's many leaks and roof damage fixed (These are curteous of our upset little ghost) Pete Postlethwaite plays Veeck, the building's maintenance man, Pete is a character actor who has been around forever and played in over 45 movies. His character wants to somewhat help, but turns out to be more of a creepy guy who plays into the plot more then you will think. Tim Roth, who I've always liked, plays Dahlia's lawyer Platzer, and he is great. He has a meeting with Dahlia in his car, because his office is being "painted" Turns out he has no office and works out of his car, but it's ok, he is still a decent lawyer nad helps in getting Mr. Murray and Veeck to clean up the apartment.<br /><br />Now here is the strongest reason I can give for the 3 stars instead of 2....Ariel Gade, she plays Cici, Connelly's daughter, and she is phenomenal. Besides being absolutely adorable, she is also quite the little actress, and though it doesnt say in the credits, I think she also plays Natasha, the little girl who dies and comes back to take Dahlia and Cici. I say this because they look exactly alike, and that would be something if this little girl was able to play such a strong dual role....I know alot of people like Dakota Fanning, and I do to, she is a hell of an actress, but watch out for this kid, she could really be something.<br /><br />So, ok story, strong cast, very little suspense or horror, I know this is a remake of a popular Japanese movie, and I hear it's much better. I am a huge fan of both The Ring and The Grudge, both remakes of Japanese movies, Dark Water comes nowhere close to those two, but it's worth the 3.79 for a decent nighs's viewing.<br /><br />acting.....4 stars, Connelly and Reilly are terrific, but remember the name Ariel Gade<br /><br />directing.....3 stars, Maybe the director of the Japanese version could have improved this a bit.<br /><br />special effects....3 stars, Lots and lots of water....too much water<br /><br />horror rating....2.5 stars, Very little scares and chills, a few creepy moments, but generally pretty slow<br /><br />quality.....2.5 stars, Way to dark!!! It's very hard to focus on a scene you know is important when you can't see the dang thing!!</p></body></html>

Sometimes it's fast-paced, then other times it's slow-paced. The action sequences aren't that great, and ants don't seem to be as threatening and creepy as snakes and rats. CGI doesn't work well here: the visual effects in "Temple" and "Crusade" look much more realistic than the effects here in "Kingdom". The prairie dogs and monkeys don't fit in; they make this look like a naive family film, which it isn't. John Williams's music seems to be a re-has of the music from the trilogy; nothing special. And plus, Shia Lebeouf is badly miscast. I'm sure they could've picked a more believable (and perhaps, new) actor to play the greaser. His presence in the film makes me think of "Transformers"; I'm supposed to think of this as an INDY film!<br /><br />But this film does have its moments. We get to see an older Indy, and knowing what it's like to lose some of the spark that's found in the original trilogy. The Soviets are the new enemies, and they're a good replacement for the 40's Nazis. Karen Allen returns as Indy's old love, Marian, and plot twists do ensue here (I won't spoil all of it). John Hurt and Kate Blanchett give out splendid performances, while Harrison Ford and Karen Allen brings this film up a notch.<br /><br />It's hard to say whether this film is a Godsend or a piece of crap, so I give this a 2.5/5.</p></body></html>

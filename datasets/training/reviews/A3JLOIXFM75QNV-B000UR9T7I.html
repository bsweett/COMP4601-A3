The overblown, boring sappy story is pathetic and being the length it is, I was squirming halfway through, and I never do that. The 'enemies' were laughable, especially Sandman, who was utterly and completely pointless. Toby Maguire is so whiny in this( though that is pretty typical of him in this role). I will not even start on Kirsten Dunst. The one decent thing is the effects. But then again, I've seen it all before, so, nothing new. I would probably never watch this again.</p></body></html>

Kirsten Dunst, who plays the title role, is also a very beautiful and somewhat accomplished (two Spidermans; Eternal Sunshine; no doubt some others I haven't seen) actress that's becoming one of my favorites of her generation (along with the wonderful Natalie Portman).  Jason Schartzman, who plays the Dauphin Louis-Auguste and then King Louis, was terrific in "Rushmore".<br /><br />Directed by Sofia Coppola (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00011RPB0">Lost in Translation</a>), "Marie Antoinette" is much more of a visual experience than a plot-driven story.  Marie, a princess in her own right in Austria, arrives at the Court of France as a 15-year old promised to Dauphin Louis-Auguste, a sluggish boy of 16 with a passion for locksmithing.  She tries her best to ingratiate herself to Louis, to adjust to the attentions of the court, and eventually to enjoy all that is available.<br /><br />The movie features the most fantastic depiction of desserts ever filmed (at least for a Hollywood production) and also some of the most outlandish hairdos (many of which resemble pastries).  However, once she becomes mother to a dauphine and the long-awaited new dauphin, Marie becomes more serious about her role, to the extent that this is possible in the hothouse of Versailles.  Dunst is brilliant as the young, confused and eventually giddy Marie; she struggles somewhat with the more serious depiction near the end---perhaps that's intentional to convey Marie's actual struggle in the situation.<br /><br />Schwartzman was disappointingly flat as Louis--I think that the writers and Coppola could have made better use of this talented actor.  There's also some heavy innuendo (and a little more) about Marie's relationship with a Swedish soldier (and perhaps the fatherhood of the dauphin) which I've read is not well-supported by history, though it adds a note of tension to the story.<br /><br />Most memorable are the scenes where we watch Marie attended to by 15 or 20 courtiers, led by Judi Davis (each with a particular role, determined by seniority) as she rises in the morning, and the even larger group in attendance as she delivers the couple's first child.  Talk about needing privacy.  We also enjoyed seeing the mini-palace and country "cottage" that Louis had built for Marie after the birth of each child.  We saw the palace and walk the cottage grounds (it was a working farm of sorts) when we visited last year.<br /><br />A little offputting, probably for me moreso than younger viewers, is Coppola's use of modern pop music in the score.  My thought all along was that Mozart and others wrote some beautiful music that would have fit the scene better and sounded just as good.  Still, I guess she felt she needed more of a hook to younger audiences than the appearance of Dunst.  To Coppola's credit, she ends the film well short of depicting the historical end for the King and Queen of France; another plus for young viewers.  All in all, "Marie Antoinette" is an engaging and informative movie, certainly appropriate for adults and all teenagers.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sad coming of age drama."></head><body><p>This movie is a sweet, but sad story of a dreamer boy who is building a wall a round his heart and an adventurous girl who reaches out to him. Its beautifully shot with fantastic animals and lush green forests. The kids act real enough to be convincing. The only thing that I did not like was the way the ending was done it was heavy handed, and like a sucker punch got you while you weren't looking. My son watched it with me and we both were surprised at the movies ending. Overall I recomend it, but you may want too explain some parts to your children.</p></body></html>

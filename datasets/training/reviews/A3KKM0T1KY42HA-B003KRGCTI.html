<meta name="summary" content="On The Road With Eli"></head><body><p>Well, after watching two equally great movies about a post-apocalyptic world one thing is for sure: life on Earth will suck after the apocalypse. Whether we ultimately nuke ourselves to oblivion or some stray asteroid does the job instead, both of the writers for The Book of Eli and The Road see a dystopian world full of cannibals and little hope. I hope that we never truly experience it, but, man, these two movies were cool!<br /><br />Of the two movies I think that I liked Eli a little bit more, which is reflective of my affinity for violent, graphic novel-esque movies. And indeed, The Book of Eli seemed to be exactly that...a graphic novel come to life about a rogue nomad determined to transport a special book west across a bleak and dangerous landscape. But Eli (Denzil Washington) is prepared to make the transfer...well prepared. Yes, there is unrest in the forest and Eli will keep it all equal with hatchet, ax and saw. And are higher forces at work helping to guide Eli along?<br /><br />Then there's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB563E">The Road</a>. This time the traveler is a man (Viggo Mortensen) also heading off in search of a safe haven. This man believes that the safe haven is south, and like Eli, he also has some cargo with him that he intends to protect and deliver safely at all costs...that cargo being his son. The land that Mortensen & son attempt to cross is in the same condition and full of the same dangers that I mentioned that Eli was dealing with. The Road is a lot lighter on the violence than Eli and more about a father trying to lead his son down a path of righteousness, while at the same time maintaining self-preservation as numero uno.<br /><br />I'd almost suggest that the two stories could be tied together and happening simultaneously in a United States devastated by catastrophe. Although, in Eli the apocalypse is explained as the result of nuclear war and bright sunlight burning the planet up due to resulting damage to the ozone layer; and I don't recall an explanation in The Road, but I think that we're supposed to gather that it was from a giant asteroid or something that created a world where a dust cloud permanently obscures the sun. Either way it's a living doomsday.<br /><br />Both movies feature a host of A-list actors, and even the actors that aren't as well known give A-list performances. Action. Thrills. Emotion. Get it all in two parallel worlds where you will kill or be killed for something that today you'd have discarded as trash. The Book of Eli and The Road as a double-feature for your weekend? Dreadfully good time.</p></body></html>

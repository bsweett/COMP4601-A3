<meta name="summary" content="A great ending to a great series"></head><body><p>I have watched Rocky since it first came out and I just love the guy! I almost got to see it when it first came out around Christmas, but opted to Dreamgirls and prayed to be one of the first to buy it when they released it on DVD, and sure enough, I was one of the first, I watched it tonight and wasn't disappointed; Watching Rocky at Adrian's grave was real touching; Bringing back Little Marie(now grown and in need of a little help)was a nice touch; Seeing Rocky moving on with his restaurant(lvoingly named after Adrian) and seeing Paulie again(who never disappoints us no matter what with his wisecracks and asides); and you got a good ending to a great set of movies; I'm like the promoter who wanted Rocky in Rocky 5, Rocky truly fought some wars in the ring, and in this film, he shows us that he still got some of it left in him; Only this time, he goes toe to toe with the Boxing Commission, for refusing to let him box even though he passed the tests and physicals; To bringing his family in line for this event, and most of all, bringing himself to the ring and fighting this young fella; he doesn't disappoint us. Personally, I thought after Rocky 5, it was OVER. even bought the Boxed 5 set; but I was a bit happy to see Rock come back like a phoenix in Rocky Balboa. He'll always be a favorite and hero of mine.</p></body></html>

I went into it expecting it to be a fairly lame superhero movie, but the action was cool, the  villains were nicely creepy, and we got a chick who could set herself on fire, which is more than you get from most movies. So I was looking forward to Hellboy 2, but in that wary, don't-get-your-hopes-up kind of way.<br /><br />Ugh. The only redeeming thing about Hellboy 2 is that it proves the adage that "a man who will die for you is nice, but a man who will live for you is better". Proving that Hollywood, once again, cannot portray a committed couple that isn't constantly fighting, Hellboy and Blair have "moved in" together, but Hellboy continues to be his slovenly self (he'll die for her, but he won't pick up after his eighteen cats) and Blair has been reduced by the sexist writers into a screaming hag who sets the apartment on fire twice a week because she doesn't get her way, rather than doing the sensible thing and maintaining a separate apartment, and/or getting a new superhero boyfriend to hang with. (Of course, also true to Hollywood form, an unplanned pregnancy will solve all these problems, since pregnancies ALWAYS strengthen rocky relationships, right?)<br /><br />If the movie wasn't unsympathetic enough to Blair, we ramp up the sexism with a character that SHOULD have been useful for more than just plot exposition and yet, bafflingly, is not. The Evil Prince, our antagonist, has a twin - a Good Princess - of royal blood, and with an interesting twist: whatever wounds one twin sustains, the other twin suffers from as well. This is a very interesting plot device, and the ending seems like it would almost write itself - the Good Princess needs to challenge the Evil Prince for control of the royal army. The Princess has the royal standing to challenge for control (only a member of royal blood may issue the challenge) and the fight for control would be an eternal stalemate - the Prince cannot harm or kill the Princess without harming or killing himself. The result would be haunting, poignant, tragic, as she and he stand down each other silently, for eternity, until their long lives run out, as the golden army patiently rusts around them, waiting for a victor that will never be declared.<br /><br />Instead...the Princess is relegated to a secondary character, as Hellboy challenges the Prince instead. This makes no sense. The "royal" standing that Hellboy has to challenge is, uh, the fact that he's the son of the Prince of Darkness. Mmkay. And since killing the Prince would be kind of churlish (as it will kill the Princess as well), the movie makers allow Hellboy to lose and the Princess to commit suicide as a Deus Ex Machina to bring the movie mercifully to a close. I guess they decided an "exciting" fight scene between Hellboy and the Prince would be cooler than a thoughtful showdown between the two twins, but I thought the change was a terrible one.<br /><br />Beyond that, nothing to see here. Blair is, as noted, annoying and Goth-y. Doug Jones returns as Abe Sapien, and yet manages to sound like a completely different person - I had to double-check that it was the same actor for both movies. The returning "tension" between Hellboy and his handlers is old hat, and the new monsters (and, indeed, the new plot) doesn't contain the same level of creepiness and terror we had in the original. I might watch the third movie, if they make it, because I'm mildly intrigued in the concept that Blair is now pregnant with the one destined to end our world, but I seriously hope they get some fresh writers.<br /><br />This version provides a closed caption option for the hard of hearing.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></body></html>

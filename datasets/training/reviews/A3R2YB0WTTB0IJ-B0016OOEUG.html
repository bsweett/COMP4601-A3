<meta name="summary" content="OTTO PREMINGER, OPUS 7"></head><body><p>***** 1944. Based on Vera Caspary's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1558615059">Laura (Femmes Fatales: Women Write Pulp)</a>, LAURA was produced and directed by Otto Preminger. Academy award in the Best Cinematography category and four other nominations. While Det. Lt. Mark McPherson is investigating the murder of Laura Hunt, the young woman suddenly reappears in perfect health. LAURA is a motion picture I watch every five years or so. It's a gem of the film noir genre and it hasn't aged a bit. In my teenage years, I was mostly attracted by Gene Tierney's almost irreal presence on the screen, later it was Dana Andrews's taciturn and low-key performance that stroke me as essential and, yesterday, I finally understood that LAURA's main character was in fact Waldo Lydecker, played by the incredible Clifton Webb; this character literally forges Laura Hunt's personality and provokes, thanks to his suggestive descriptions of Laura Hunt, McPherson's love for the young woman. LAURA is a must if you like the film noir genre or, simply, Cinema. Indispensable.</p></body></html>

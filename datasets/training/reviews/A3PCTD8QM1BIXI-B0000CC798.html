<meta name="summary" content="Amazing sequel"></head><body><p>Not only did X2 set the standard for the five plus sequels that came out in the summer of 2003, it's has replaced Blade 2 as my favortie comic book sequel since Superman II. From the opening action with new mutant Nightcrawler we know we are in for a amazing ride. The action sequences are taken to the next level in the film, the script is witty and there's a few surpises for us hardcore X-Men fans. Bryan Singer has made another great film in this sequel and hopefully he'll reedeem hisself with the Superman sequel.</p></body></html>

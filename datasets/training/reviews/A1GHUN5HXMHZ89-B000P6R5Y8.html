The dreams were so vivid that even today I'm not entirely certain that I didn't fly. Disney has created another masterpiece based on a wonderful book. When a young boy living on a farm has only his little sister rooting for him when he foot races, he resigns himself to fantasy in his drawings. Soon new neighbors move in and a girl his own age shows up at school. There is something quite different about her. She writes with the imaginative vision of a great author. As they become close friends and share their dreams of Terabithia, they also grow in their relationships with others. Understand that unfortunately life is not always kind. Disney like they did in "Eight Below" show us that when there is loss of life, we must continue on and remember those we've lost in what we do. I rented this, but I will no doubt buy the DVD now that I have seen it. I highly recommend this movie for the whole family.</p></body></html>

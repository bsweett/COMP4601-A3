<meta name="summary" content="GOOD SEQUEL TO THE ORIGINAL"></head><body><p>The original 'Halloween' is considered a classic by many. "Halloween II" is a true sequel which starts off right where the first film ends, a very effective way to get fans of the original drawn into this installment. This film has a much larger budget and it shows, but the film lacks the eerrie quality as the original. The DVD transfer is good, but a special edition would be appreciated by fans of the series.</p></body></html>

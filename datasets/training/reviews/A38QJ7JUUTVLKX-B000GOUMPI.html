<meta name="summary" content="SERIOUS HORROR!!!"></head><body><p>Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining is more of a reimagining of of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than an adaptation. In my oppinion this is better than the book. It's scarier, and has more suspense in it. Blood? Yes there is blood, but it helps the movie, not detracts. The Shining is terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. So any negative reviews are from book purist, or somebody who wants people to think he/she is tough, so see this movie. It is long, but it is worth you time. This is one of the scariest movies of all time! WATCH IT ALONE IN THE DARK!</p></body></html>

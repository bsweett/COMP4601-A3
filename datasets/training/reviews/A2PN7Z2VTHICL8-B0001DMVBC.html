<meta name="summary" content="Is this your house?"></head><body><p>At first, I thought 'House Of Sand And Fog' would be a rather drawn out and boring movie, a sort of touchy-feelie film that I may admire but not necessarily enjoy.  I was happily wrong.<br /><br />House Of Sand And Fog is a drama that blooms with carefully orchestrated, subtle suspense, and carries with it the slight reek of prejudice.  Who would you trust to be honest and fair?  A Muslim Iranian family?  A recovering, unemployed addict?  A police officer?  And just what type of greed would you consider to be the worst type?<br /><br />Kathy (played by extremely talented Jennifer Connelly-Labyrinth, Requiem For A Dream) is a recovering addict, recently inheriting an older but cozy house from her father.  However, the county mistakenly believes that she owes business tax and repossesses her property, leaving her homeless.  Kathy is helped out by Officer Lester Burdon (played by Ron Eldard-Ghost Ship), who gives her an attorney's phone number and helps her pack her things.<br /><br />Colonel Massoud Behrani (played by the incomparable Ben Kingsley-Suspect Zero, Schindler's List, Sneakers), an Iranian immigrant, finds the house listed for sale by the county and quickly purchases it.  Behrani has spent every penny earned at working several jobs to ensure his daughter was married into a suitable family.  Now he must see to his son's college, and dreams of fixing up the old house and making enough profit for his son's future.<br /><br />Kathy hires an attorney to get her house back, but Behrani will not sell back to the county for less than four times the amount he paid for it.  When Kathy sees that the law moves too slow, she confronts the Behrani's in an attempt to appeal to their sense of justice.<br /><br />In the midst of her conflict with the Behrani's, Lester continues to take more than a casual interest in Kathy, to the point of leaving his wife and children to start fresh with her.  How far will Lester and Kathy go to get back what rightfully belongs to her?  Is Colonel Behrani an evil man or a victim himself?  You will find that things are not always how they first appear, and will be holding your breath by the time House Of Sand And Fog reaches its surprising and powerful finish.<br /><br />The lines between good and evil are thin and silvery gray in this exceptional dark tale of misguided intensions and ill-gotten gains.  The photography is virtually stunning, the script tight, the acting above spectacular, and the emotion all too real.  Special mention goes to actress Shohreh Aghdashloo who plays Nadi Behrani, and to Jonathon Ahdout who plays Esmail Behrani.  Their superior supporting roles created a truly believable family with the Behranis.<br /><br />Don't think for one minute that House Of Sand And Fog is your usual, uninspired drama.  This is a dark journey into the heart, touching those black spots that leak poison inside all of us.  Definitely worth a purchase.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

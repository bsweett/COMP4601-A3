<meta name="summary" content="5 Stars despite Gambit miscasting"></head><body><p>This movie brings back good memories of the Barry Windsor-Smith miniseries and uses advances in special effects to bring out the spirit of the Wolverine comic character.  Hugh Jackman is an adequate Wolverine without the growl but Liev Schreiber made Sabretooth interesting and attractive when the comic character is completely offensive and odious.  The miscasting of Gambit was the biggest problem with this purely entertaining movie.  Gambit is supposed to look like a young Clint Eastwood including the cheroot and the lovely pompadour.</p></body></html>

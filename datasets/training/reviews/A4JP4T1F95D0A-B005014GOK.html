Still waiting for Nazi werewolves from Zombie and Thanksgiving from Roth.  Machete didn't really grab me because it looked too similar to every character that Trejo has played.  Granted because of his look he is pretty limited in what he can do.  The movie is a throwback to the 70's complete with the scratchy film.  Ultra violent with a bit of nudity.  I believe Trejo beds every major female lead in the film.  It is fun and over the top at time, but for the most part it fails.  It certainly bashes the right politically.  To me it just feels too long.  It seems like a fun idea for about 30 minutes which would have been great if he had taken 3 short concepts and made a 90 minute 3 short film feature.  It just didn't hold me.  I hung in to see a naked Lohan and to watch a fat Steven Seagal go in and out of a Spanish accent.  Also hold off buying this movie since I heard there will be an unrated cut with lots of extras coming out in the future.</p></body></html>

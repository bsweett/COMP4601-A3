<meta name="summary" content="Based on the true story of Frank Lucas"></head><body><p>It's Harlem, 1968, and "Bumpy" Johnson is speaking to his driver and right-hand man Frank Lucas (the amazing Denzel Washington).  Bumpy laments the loss of the middleman in business, the jobs lost to overseas companies, the end of the era of the working man.  When Bumpy dies and Frank takes over, he omits the middleman too and purchases his heroin directly from Bangkok and ships it via military aircraft through Vietnam to the US.  Frank is on his way up, and he doesn't let anyone stand in his way, even those who think now that Bumpy is dead, so is his business.<br /><br />Detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is an honest cop who's taking night classes to become a lawyer.  He's well aware of how corrupt the Drug Enforcement Division is, the police taking busted dope from evidence, cutting it, and reselling it on the streets.  Richie and his partner find $1M in the trunk of a dealer's car, and against his partner's warning they turn in the money.  Now they can't get backup and the other cops won't work with them because they can't trust honest cops.<br /><br />While Frank represents The American Dream (even if it's the wrong dream) by being a gentleman, a good family man who loves his mother, his wife, and America, Richie the honest cop is a failure at his marriage, a womanizer, and a absent father to his son.<br /><br />Frank's on top of the world, until an innocent gift from his wife begins his decline.  Always counseling his brothers not to dress flashy and attract attention, he makes the mistake of wearing the showy, fifty thousand dollar chinchilla coat and hat his wife gave him to a boxing match.  Sitting in better seats than the Italians, shaking hands with Joe Lewis, and standing out like a sore thumb, he catches the attention of Richie, who's heading a task force to nail all the big time drug players.  The cops are onto Frank now, both the good ones and the bad ones.  Frank is exposed, and his world is about to change.<br /><br />Though based on a true story, I've never heard of the case so I can't comment on how close to reality the film came.  The movie starts slow, and is kind of hard to get into.  Keep watching, the movie comes together and the pace quickens.  It's a movie where you'll find yourself rooting for the bad guy even though you shouldn't, because Frank seems like such a nice guy (except when he's shooting people).  It's also a movie you'll want to view again, to catch all the nuances in the relationships.  On a personal note, I liked all the old cars they found to use in the movie, not one car was outside the time frame.  This review is based on the Unrated Extended Version, not the theatrical version.  Rent first, then buy.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very enjoyable"></head><body><p>I really liked this film. Natalie Portman does a nice job as Evie, and I really liked the character of V. Overall this is a really good movie with lots of exciting parts and drama. I would have given this movie a 5-star rating, but I was disappointed in the fact that they didn't explore V's background as much as they could/should have, since without that, the story didn't feel as well-rounded as it could have.</p></body></html>

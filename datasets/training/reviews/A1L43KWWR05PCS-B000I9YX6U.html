<meta name="summary" content="INTRIGUING AND INTELLIGENT PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER..."></head><body><p>This is a superlative psychological thriller and one of the best in the genre,  with a bravura performance by Robin Williams as a somewhat unhinged photo technician. Deftly directed by Mark Romanek, who has an eye for detail and an understanding that less is sometimes more, it is simply one of the best films released in 2002.<br /><br />The plot line seems simple. Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) is an exacting  photo technician in a large, squeaky clean and bright, well stocked,  discount mall type store. A lonely, middle-aged man, he seems to fade into the background. He is the type of person of whom others are apt to take little notice. Polite and pleasant, he is seemingly inoffensive, yet, always a beat off. He also has one little foible. He has become obsessed with the Yorkin family.<br /><br />The Yorkins are customers of his for whom he develops photographs. He has been developing their photos for years and has seen most of their cherished moments, participating in them vicariously. It is as if Nina, Will, and  their young son, Jake,  have become his family, only the Yorkins haven't a clue about Sy's secret obsession. When Sy becomes aware that the sanctity of  his secret, picture perfect family is endangered, he becomes the avenging angel, setting into motion a series of events that reveal his own deepest, darkest secret.<br /><br />Robin Williams is absolutely sensational as Sy, the photo guy. He transforms himself, as if he were a chameleon. His performance is brilliant and well nuanced. As strange as Sy may seem at times, the viewer cannot help but like and pity him, even when he is at his weirdest. Sy's palpable longing to be a part of the Yorkin family is heartbreaking. Though most of his interaction is with Connie and Jake, as they are the ones who bring in the family photos to be developed, when Will comes to the store one day, Sy immediately recognizes him from the photos. Sy introduces himself to the surprised Will,  asking after his family and complimenting Will on his home, a place in which Sy has never been a guest. It is all slightly creepy, adding to the mounting tension in the film. Robin Williams plays the role of Sy to great effect, making the most of each and every moment that he is on screen. He is the quintessential lonely man, so isolated and alienated from those around him that any of his attempts at interaction with others is always a beat off.<br /><br />Connie Nielsen is luminous as Nina Yorkin, a woman who is always pleasant to Sy and brightens his day every time she and Jake walk in the store to have photos developed. She is a woman whose beaming countenance belies the knowledge that there is something wrong with her marriage. There is a canker taking hold of her suburban home, eating away at the core of her family, only she cannot get Will to discuss it rationally with her.  She does not know what is wrong, only that there is definitely something amiss, although all will, ultimately, be made clear to her.<br /><br />Michael Vartan is excellent as Will Yorkin, the good looking, though slightly unlikable, husband. Dylan Smith gives a sweet performance as Jake Yorkin. Erin Daniels is perfectly cast as Maya, a woman for whom Sy also develops photos. Eriq La Salle is very good as the sensitive Detective Van Der Zee. Gary Cole is terrific as the high energy store manager who gets on Sy's case about a number of issues that are coming to light in connection with the seemingly placid Sy. This is a solid cast that contributes to the overall success of this interesting and quirky film.<br /><br />The sets are also used most effectively. The bright, almost bleached, starkness of the huge store set is a perfect setting for Sy, as he almost melds into the background, at times, as if he were disappearing. Only his bright blue store vest saves him from total obscurity. This is fraught with meaning, as it is his job that helps to keep Sy grounded.  The Yorkin home is filled with earth tones, giving a homey, cozy glow, enshrouding the family in a haze of warmth. Sy's own apartment is a sterile, ugly environment. There is nothing cozy about it. The only real sign that someone may actually live there are the photographs of the Yorkins that are displayed for all the world to see.<br /><br />Moreover, just when one thinks one has it all figured out, there are more surprises to come. This is simply a brilliant film on many fronts. The direction, Robin Williams' performance, the sets, the restrained, low key, tension building approach, and the twist in the ending, all contribute to making this a film to add to one's collection. Bravo!</p></body></html>

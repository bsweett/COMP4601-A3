'The Book of Eli' and a film I just reviewed, 'Frailty', are major exceptions to this general rule.  Eli, although not the returned Messiah, is his prophet in the desert of a ravaged earth.<br /><br />The earth has been savaged by an apolcalyptic war and ignorance rules the land.  He who has pre-apocalyptic knowledge has the potential for great and destructive power and there are those who will kill to learn its secrets.  Eli, in a way similar to the demi-God, Achilles, in the Iliad, has been touched by the eternal and is--unfortunately for his enemies--virtually immune to danger and evil.  He is the agent by which the world may be saved.</p></body></html>

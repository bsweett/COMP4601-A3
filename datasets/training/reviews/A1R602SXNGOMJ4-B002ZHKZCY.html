Featuring exotic locations and car chases that are really captivating. The characters in the movie played their parts convincingly well, that you felt part of the movie.<br /><br />The sequel further develops the character of Jason Borne and provides more insights into his past as his amnesia seems to be wearing out. And how his emotional 'conflicts' are making this into a three dimensional James Bond type movie.  What can I say; this is better than Bond series, with all the actions, sophisticated car chase scenes, the cat and mouse chase and the tactic between the killing machine and the world biggest organization. The soundtrack is also great.</p></body></html>

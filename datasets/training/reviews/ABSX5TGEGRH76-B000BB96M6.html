<meta name="summary" content="Twisted, Dark, Fun: Another Burton Success"></head><body><p>I remember the first time that I saw a trailer for this; my friend showed it to me on my computer, and it absolutely freaked me out.  It was colorful, it was trippy, and it had a VERY annoying song in the background.  Yet, I still was drawn to it.  For one thing, Tim Burton was directing it, and I have liked most of the Tim Burton movies that I have seen (let's not go into a Planet of the Apes discussion).  And while Gene Wilder will always be Willy Wonka to me, Johnny Depp took the role, made it his own, and did a very good job with it.<br /><br />Seeing as how most people already know the ending, I am going to be a little more open with spoilers than I normally am.  Anyway, the choclateer Willy Wonka owns an amazing chocolate factory that churns out some of the best chocolate in the world.  Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is a poor boy living with his parents (Noal Taylor, Helena Bonham Carter) and his grandparents (David Kelly, Eileen Essell, David Morris, and Liz Smith), most of whom have personalities in this film.  In the original, only Grandpa Joe was fleshed out as a character, but in this version, the only one without a distinct personality is Grandma Josephine (Essell).  Joe (Kelly) is an ex-worker in the factory, George (Morris) is a bit of a cynic, and Georgina (Smith) is a bit senile.  But they are all a very loving family.<br /><br />After years of shutting himself off from the outside world and not allowing anyone to visit his factory due to past spies, Wonka has decided to allow 5 children to visit his factory.  They will be chosen through the use of Golden Tickets; 5 tickets are randomly placed into Wonka Bars going all over the world.  The first 4 children to find them are rich, fat, or have some special means to get the ticket that most children, especially Charlie, don't have.  Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) is an overweight German boy who could (and probably does) eat his weight in chocolate each day.  Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) is an over-spoiled girl whose father (James Fox) gives her whatever her heart desires (and the desire is fleeting; the moment she receives the ticket, without even saying "thank you", she asks for a new pony).  Violet Beauregarde (Annasophia Robb) is an overcompetetive gum-chewing champ who feels that if she doesn't win the ticket, she fails.  It doesn't help that her mother (Missi Pyle) encourages the behavior.  Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry) is a video-game playing genius (with anger issues) who devises a mathematical formula to track down the ticket.  He only bought one bar (and didn't even eat it because he dislikes the taste of chocolate, which begs the question why he wanted to win a trip to a chocolate factory).  Charlie finds the ticket based on pure luck.  But soon the five children are off to the factory.<br /><br />Once there, they meet the Oompa Loompas (all of them are played by Deep Roy), see fantastic machines and gizmos (such as a waterfall that exists to mix the chocolate), and meet their demise.  Yes, meet their demise.  Each character is done in by their flaws (gluttany, competitiveness, greed, and pride).  And with each loss of a child, Wonka seems almost elated.<br /><br />This movie is a lot truer to its source material than the original (I mean this neither as a compliment or a jab, I am merely stating a fact).  The fact that Charlie's dad is alive, the Indian palace made of chocolate, and the departing view of the other four children after their mishaps (which I was very happy to see) were all in the book, but not the original film.  Although, the fact that the movie explored Wonka's childhood was both a blessing and a curse.  It was very interesting to see where Wonka came from (and it's always great to see Christopher Lee), but the whole point is that we don't know why Wonka is the way he is.<br /><br />This movie definitely won't appeal to everyone, and I can foresee some Wilder vs. Depp fan arguments on the horizon.  But check it out, it's worth it.</p></body></html>

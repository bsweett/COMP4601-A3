<meta name="summary" content="A pretty good movie with great stars."></head><body><p>James Mangold's "Walk the Line" is a decent, slightly plodding show-biz biopic that benefits mightily from the astonishing talents of its two stars. If you've seen the film biographies of Elvis, Ray Charles, Buddy Holly, etc., then you've seen this one; the screenplay is fairly standard and doesn't trim all the fat from the story. During some of the expository scenes, I found that I didn't keep my eyes wide open all the time. But when Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were on stage together singing, I was all eyes and ears. Phoenix and Witherspoon have so much electricity together that they virtually give off sparks, and if they don't sound exactly like Johnny Cash and June Carter, they're both good singers and do up the Cash-Carter songbook in fine style. Virtually everybody knows the basic outlines of Cash's story, and it's a story as old as the hills: a good man, beset by tragedy and personal demons, finds redemption through faith in God and the love of a good woman. If Mangold's exposition sometimes gets in the way of the story, Phoenix's performance never does; he brings Cash's pain to galvanizing life, capturing the essence of the man without ever resorting to a mere impressionist's trickery. A few critics have accused Witherspoon of giving us too much Reese and not enough June. I don't know enough about June Carter to tell; I only know that Witherspoon is so charming, funny, impassioned and real here that who cares whether she captures Carter exactly? Among the supporting players, Ginnifer Goodwin does a fine job as Cash's first wife Vivian, and it's not her fault that she appears in some of the more boring scenes. Phoenix and Witherspoon are sure to be remembered at Oscar time, and they are the urgent, overriding reasons to go see "Walk the Line."</p></body></html>

This sequel, by contrast, is dreary and belaboured, everything too calculated and cold... I'm sure they meant for it to be stylish and sexy, but it's all just dreadfully dull.  The film sets up the most hackneyed cliches (Blade the loner gets set up with a super team, a punkish/modern primitive vampire platoon, which he must lead to defeat their common foe...) but instead of following through on the premise, the filmmakers just let it drop to the floor, as flat as everything else in the movie.  No one bothers to embue the members of the group with any personality -- why bother?  they're going to die anyway.  In fact, they hardly get any dialogue at all, not even a wisecrack or cynical aside.  It's all just chop chop chop hack hack slice dice chop chop chop.  Hack.  Slice slice slice.  Bang bang bang.  Boom. Chop. Slice. Pow. Chop.  Bang bang bang.  Techno fetishism and grotty special effects are supposed to save this film, but once again, we learn the lesson that razzle dazzle and gimmickry in and of themselves cannot make a dead film fly.  An 11+ on the yawn-o-meter.</p></body></html>

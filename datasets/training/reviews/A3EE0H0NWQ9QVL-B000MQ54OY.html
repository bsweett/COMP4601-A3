<meta name="summary" content="'Happy Feet' Tap Dances Its Way to Dizzying Heights"></head><body><p>'Happy Feet' is an animated feature that has some dizzying animation effects.  Sitting there in the theatre, I thought at times that I was watching an I-Max feature.  (And at times I was glad I wasn't, which leads me to believe that the cries of one young theatre-goer, indicate it may be too intense for younger viewers.)  For the rest of us over seven, there is a good, although familiar, story of the misfit penguin.  "Mumble" (played with proper insecurity by the voice of the Hobbit, Elijah Wood) does what comes naturally.  Having some latent pre-hatched anomolies, he comes out ready to dance rather than sing.  It alienates him from his community and his love interest, Gloria (played with sexy voice by Brittany Murphy).  His loner pursuit gets him in another fold.  (In this case they're alien penguins with Spanish accents.)  The elders disaprove of the alien assimilation, reasoning that too many mouths to feed will stretch community resources too thin.  (Sound familiar?)  The development is often episodic with harrowing enemies--like a sea lion--and songs that burst out at the drop of an iceburg.  (Just like other musicals, characters burst out in song for the weather--or, in this case Northern Lights, and falling in love--or, again, mating season.)  The bursts of songs are decent to splendid.  (This film is worth every penny for watching the penguins dive into arctic waters from great heights while the full stereo spendour of the Beach Boys' "Do It Again" pipes through the digital sound.)<br /><br />The main plot has a point and a destination.  Mumble meets into Lovelace (Robin Williams) who is the penguin guru.  (Much of the movie makes political points, for he wears an involuntary necklace made from a plastic six-pack ring.)  He is short on advice, but Mumble has the messianic touch to go solo on a trek to discover the aliens (man) and solve the mystery of the disappearing food supply.  "Happy Feet" Mumble tries to bridge that gap and bring home the bacon (or in this case, sardines).  While I either respect or agree with the viewpoints of the film, I sometimes think it would be more effective if they "chilled out" a little bit.  Besides that, 'Happy Feet' is an irresistible animated musical drama/comedy.  (Robin Williams does three voices, including Mumble's main homie, Ramon, which sounds like Williams' comedy portrayal of Ricardo Maltoban.)</p></body></html>

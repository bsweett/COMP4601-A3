<meta name="summary" content=""Let us never forget 9-11!"  Jeez, when are we gonna let this tragedy go and just get on with our own lives?"></head><body><p>I can't believe this movie actually went straight to the theatre. This movie is not even worthy of typical prime-time television. Even if I lost a loved one who was portrayed in this film, I'd still be bored to tears of how it's being such an empty, long-winded, story, only focused on mainly just two people. "Oh, help me, help me, I'm trapped." "We're doing what we can, we love you, we love you!" Oh brother! Jeez, that's some really creative writing, huh? This film was so unnecessary. We've all already imagined all the horrifying aspects of the tragedy. There's nothing new here.<br /><br />Think about it. If this event never really happened, but they made a film like this anyway. You'd have to agree that this movie is quite boring. Just a bunch of tear-shedding dialogue. This could have easily been just a low cost television show.<br /><br />Now "United 93" was definately more of a detailed story. It was much better done, and more "on the edge of your seat" entertaining. Yes, I said "entertaining!". Why do YOU go to see a movie? Because you wanna go and cry about something?  I found studying Algebra more entertaining than this long-winded yawner of a just an exchange of tearful woes and prayers.<br /><br />And what's more, why would anyone want to own this movie? To see a miserable situation played out over and over. Just like "The Passion of Christ" too. Who would actually want to watch that movie over and over just to see Jesus Christ beatened? I'm sure we all thank Jesus for suffering for our sins, but I wouldn't want to watch a movie that shows me that he's suffering for me.<br /><br />And all this "9-11" hype. C'mon, this is something of the past. We need to let it go and get on with our lives. I'm so tired of being reminded that it happened. Trying to keep this sad tragedy imbedded in our minds can not be psychologically healthy. There is no benefit in mentally sustaining an irreversable tragedy of a "done deal" event. Why give Al-Queda the pleasure of seeing us continuing to suffer from that one event? Their hearts are laughing everyday, everytime we voice our pain about that tragic day.  The more we keep showing our pain and fear of their existance, the more they'll continue enjoying the small victory of their terrorist act.<br /><br />Well anyway, there's a ball game on tonight! That's all that matters right now! Let's just focus on that and get on with our lives in a positive way.<br /><br />So, I'm sure everyone thinks that I am cold and insensitive. However, that's not true at all. Hollywood sees "9-11" as a guaranteed money maker.  Creating movies to continue to provoke everyone's fears about that day is a cold and insensitive approach to profitable commercialism.  Making money out of making movies like this is no more in "bad taste" than someone selling "I survived 9-11" T-shirts.<br /><br />Hey, now there's an idea! (just kidding).</p></body></html>

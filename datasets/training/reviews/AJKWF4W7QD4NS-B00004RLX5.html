<meta name="summary" content="The most fun and entertaining Trek film"></head><body><p>Considered by many to be the best in the series, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home finds Kirk, Spock, and crew traveling back in time to the twentieth century in hopes of finding humpback whales whose unique sounds are similar to those of a mysterious probe which is ravaging Earth.  The storyline may sound flat on paper, but thanks to a smart and humerous script, capable directing from Leonard Nimoy, and the great chemistry between the Trek crew (and the interaction between them and the San Francisco of 1986), this installment is undoubtadly the most fun and entertaining in the series.  The film was a phenominal hit when released, and paved the way for more sequels to come.  The Special Edition DVD is worth noting as well; the commentary from Nimoy and William Shatner is a must hear for any Trekkie, and the production featurettes on the making of the film are actually very interesting.  Next to The Wrath of Khan Director's Edition DVD, this is Paramount's best DVD edition of a Star Trek film.</p></body></html>

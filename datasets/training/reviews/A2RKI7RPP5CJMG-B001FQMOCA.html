<meta name="summary" content="Three Stories Unfold"></head><body><p>"Walk The Line" is supposed to be about the ups and downs of one John R. Cash, but in actuality, it's three stories in one.  The first story is that of Johnny Cash, who grew up in Arkansas a poor farmer's son.  His father was hard on him and even cruel when Johnny's older brother passes in an accident.  As Johnny gets older, he pursues a career in music.  His first big break comes at the hands of none other than Sam Phillips.  You know him for his many acts which include the King, the Killer, and the Man In Black (Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Johnny Cash, respectively), among others.  Cash begins to become very successful and slowly spins out in a self-inflicted chaos of sex, drugs, and rockabilly.<br /><br />The second story is that of June Carter, the "other" woman in Johnny Cash's life.  They befriend each other innocently enough, but as they spend more time on the road together, both of their marriages fall apart.  Cash's wife, Vivian, becomes very guarding of her children (and rightfully so), and Carter tries hard not only to save the life of Cash, but also to fight off her urges to love him.<br /><br />The third story, and my personal favorite, is that of the music created by Cash and Carter.  Their duets are amazing, and they reverberate throughout this biopic.  My personal favorite is "Jackson," but none of the songs in this flick are to be missed.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful biopic to watch.  I'd have given it five stars if it weren't for the fact that the music takes such a precedence in this movie, that we are only given a brief glimpse into the torrid life of Cash.  If you're not a fan of Cash's music, you may find yourself bored during the long scenes on tour.  I personally enjoyed them, but my wife just couldn't take it.<br /><br />The cast is wonderful.  Joaquin Phoenix is almost eerie in his presentation of Cash.  Reese Witherspoon is a spitfire as June Carter Cash.  She delivers one of the best performances of her career in this flick.  Ginnifer Goodwin plays Vivian Cash, Johnny's first wife, with tears almost permanently fixed into her eyes.  Robert Patrick and Shelby Lynne play Cash's parents, and do a wonderful job of it.  Sam Phillips and his bunch are also gamely represented here.<br /><br />I highly recommend this flick to fans of Cash or of Country and Rockabilly music in general.  Cash's music is legendary, and so is he, but let us not forget that behind every good man is a good woman (in this case, two good women).  Vivian was there in the beginning, when Johnny was starting on his downward spiral.  June literally saved him from falling into nothingness, and both of these women deserve as much credit for Cash's iconic status as he or anyone else does.<br /><br />An excellent film.</p></body></html>

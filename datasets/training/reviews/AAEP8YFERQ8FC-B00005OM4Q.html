<meta name="summary" content="The "Almost Famous" Tour"></head><body><p>I'm a big fan of all things 1970s, and am into a lot of rock bands from that era (Yes, Genesis, Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd, etc, etc, etc). I'd heard about "Almost Famous", that it was a rock'n'roll kind of film, but the moment I found out it was set in the 1970s, I kept my eye out for the DVDs. Being born in the 1980s, I can't say whether this was an accurate potrait of the music scene back then, but I certainly found it interesting.<br /><br />William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is a clever kid, so clever he's been skipped ahead two grades. He likes to write, it seems, and he loves rock music and the scene that surrounds it. He wants to become a rock journalist, so he finds a local writer, who gives him a few pointers, and his first job - to write an article. William writes his article, and it goes down really well. So well, in fact, that Rolling Stone magazine give him a call, asking him to go along with Stillwater on the road on their "Almost Famous" tour. He's underage, and has lots of exams to do at school, but with a deep voice over the phone and the help of a "band-aid" by the name of Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), he is off around America with the rock group. On the tour he sees the ups, the downs, the dirty and the cleaned up. He falls in love, learns a lot about himself and hears a little more than a music journalist is supposed to. To top it all off, his concerned mother keeps ringing around, trying to get him to come home!<br /><br />It's an intriguing, involving ride, I thought. You get to see the perspective of a 1970s band, a worried 1970s parent, a 1970s fan, and a 1970s groupie. That's a lot of points of view, and they're all handled thoughtfully, I thought. I like the look of the sets and the locations. The young extras are a nice touch too. The music playing in the background really helped set the scene, I felt. Led Zeppelin, The Who, Simon & Garfunkel, plus a song from a couple of my favorite 1970s groups like Jethro Tull and Yes. It's always nice when a good film has a good soundtrack.<br /><br />If you're interested in 1970s music, this film is definitely worth a look.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="almost a five, but im kicking a star for lack of feeling"></head><body><p>i absolutly love the story.  im a huge fan of the trilogy. yes they are brutal and i can respect people walking out because of the violence.  its massive. i love the book.  i love the movie.  first ill say that noomie rapace did a phemominal job portraying lisbeth.  she took every step. steps american actors wouldnt generally take to embody the character.  she even got mulitple facial piercings for the film (a ceptum ring and ill tell you if you dont have one.  its a painful piercing. i had a 14 g. in mine.  its like having your nose broke with someones fist.  she did massive exercise to get the maleish body build that lisbeth has.  she portrayed scenes i know people wouldnt want to do willingly.  and she pulled it off to the T.  the other actors as well were amazing.<br /><br />ok nows on to the only downpoint.  these movies are like two and a half hours long so its not like there was alot of choice but they could have shortened stuff and put in some scenes at the end that shows that lisbeth HAD human emotions.  she did.  she was in love with mikael and its stated, yes the L word, in the book.  and the sweet thing with elvis and mikael.  they knocked all of that out.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />by knocking out the fact that she was in love with mikael and how it worked with the reason she wouldnt speak to mikael through so much of the girl who played with fire.  they left the audience blinded.  they made lisbeth look like a winch with no emotion.  lisbeth didnt trust people but she wasnt that.<br />no what they did was end it like she kicked him to the curb after the case was closed.  like she didnt care.<br /><br />is the movie great.  YES! but you must order the books with the movies.  im now reading the girl who played with fire and its done the same way with the film.  to fully apreciate the movies you MUST read the books.  yes they take a long time to read with all the swedish names and the fact that they are done through the eyes of 2 protagonists. you have to pay attention to the details.  but its soooo worth it.<br /><br />ive seen all three movies.1 and  2 on dvd and 3 i saw at a art house cimena on a planetarium dome  which was awesome.<br />by the way the first is most violent one.  if you got through the violence in the girl with the dragon tattoo, youll be just fine through the girl who played with fire and the girl who kicked the hornets nest.  the second has one violent sex assault in it but its not as drawn out as the first.  all three have flash backs of the bjurman/lisbeth rape but in the 2nd and 3rd they are short. you may not want your kids awake but its not as much mental torture as the first that frankly makes you sick at your stomach.<br />i cant even watch saturday night fever but atleast in these there is revenge and or justice.</p></body></html>

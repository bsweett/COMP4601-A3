This is how the story goes: Twelve-year old Owen is viciously bullied by his classmates and neglected by his divorcing parents. Achingly lonely, Owen spends his days plotting revenge on his middle school tormentors and his evenings spying on the other inhabitants of his apartment complex. His only friend is his new neighbor Abby, an eerily self-possessed young girl who lives next door with her silent father. A frail, troubled child about Owen's age, Abby emerges from her heavily curtained apartment only at night and always barefoot, seemingly immune to the bitter winter elements. Recognizing a fellow outcast, Owen opens up to her and before long, the two have formed a unique bond. When a string of grisly murders puts the town on high alert, Abby's father disappears, and the terrified girl is left to fend for herself. Still, she repeatedly rebuffs Owen's efforts to help her and her increasingly bizarre behavior leads the imaginative Owen to suspect she's hiding an unthinkable secret.<br /><br />The cast led by Kodi Smit-Mcphee (as Owen) & Chloe Grace Moretz (as Abby), who, both give, excellent performances, is excellent! The directing & screenplay (by the novel & screenplay by John Ajvide Lindqvist) by Matt Reeves (who also directed "Cloverfield" (2008) is excellent!<br /><br />The music by Michael Giacchino (who also did the music to "The Incredibles" (2004), "Mission: Impossible III" (2006), "Ratatouille" (2008), "Star Trek" (2009) & "Up" (2009, for which he won a Oscar for Best Original Score), he also is doing the scores to the upcoming "Mission: Impossible IV" (2011) & "John Carter Of Mars" (2012) is excellent! The cinematography by Greig Fraser (who also did the cinematography to "Bright Star" (2009) & "The Boys Are Back" (2009) is excellent! The film editing by Stan Salfas is excellent! The casting by Avy Kaufman (who also did the casting, recently to "Solitary Man" (2010), "Leaves Of Grass" (2010), "Welcome To The Rileys" (2010), "Jack Goes Boating" (2010), "Salt" (2010), "My Soul To Take" (2010) & the upcoming "Scream 4" (2011) is excellent! The production design by Ford Wheeler (who also did the production design to "We Own The Night" (2007), "Rachel Getting Married" (2008) & "Greenberg" (2010) is excellent! The art direction by Guy Barnes (who also did the art direction to "The Missing" (2003), "Suspect Zero" (2004), "Seraphim Falls" (2006), "Brothers" (2009) & the upcoming "The Resident" (2010 or 2011) is excellent! The set decoration by Wendy Ozols-Barnes (who also did the set decoration to "The Missing", "Suspect Zero", "Seraphim Falls", "Brothers" & the upcoming "The Resident") is excellent! The costume design by Melissa Bruning is excellent!<br /><br />This is an excellent and well-made movie that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat at the same time, as well as heart racing. This is one of the best horror films of the year, if not, the best. It is also one of the best films of the year, so far. This is also an excellent remake that is faithful to its original, "Let The Right One In" (2008).</p></body></html>

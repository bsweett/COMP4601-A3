Whatever you think of Mel Gibson's messed-up personal life, the guy is a creative genius.<br /><br />Apocalypto is set in the pre-Columbian Mayan peninsula, and opens in a small Indian village whose young men are out in the jungle hunting a wild boar, led by their chief Flint Sky and his son Jaguar Paw. They encounter something else they never expected -- a party of terrified refugees whose village has been raided and destroyed. Little do they know that the fate of those refugees is about to hit their own tribe.<br /><br />In a pre-dawn raid the very next day, their own village is attacked by a war party of Indians from another tribe. Most of the adults, including Flint Sky, are killed, the children are spared, and Jaguar Paw, after managing to hide his pregnant wife and little son down a dry well, is captured along with some twenty other people in his tribe and dragged off to the Mayan capital. There they come upon a culture they never knew existed, vastly superior to their own, and built on a caste system that depends heavily on slave labor. But they realize they haven't been captured to be slaves -- they are human sacrifices to the Mayan god Kukulkan. Spared by a solar eclipse, Jaguar Paw and a few survivors of the carnage in Kukulkan's temple are turned over to the war party who make a game of them dodging spears and arrows before they are all killed. Only Jaguar Paw manages to flip the script, and in a stunning act of defiance of fate, kills the son of the war party's chief and escapes into the forest, with nine warriors after him screaming for his head.<br /><br />From there the film takes on an eerie resemblance to "The Naked Prey" with overtones of Xenophon's "Anabasis", with Jaguar Paw running home ahead of the pursuing party through hostile territory, trying to stay alive long enough to get back home in time to rescue his wife and son. And in a thrilling plot twist, once he manages to get back to familiar territory, the tables are turned when Jaguar Paw has the home-field advantage and the hunters turn into the hunted.<br /><br />The acting and directing in this film could not be improved upon. Rudy Youngblood gives a knockout performance as Jaguar Paw, caught up in a hell he never imagined and intent only on getting back to his world and his family. Raoul Trujillo and Gerardo Taracena are chilling as the pursuing warriors Zero Wolf and Middle Eye, and Morris Yellowbirdhead is excellent as Flint Sky. Gibson even got great performances from the children, especially Carlos Emilio Baez as Jaguar Paw's little son, and Maria Isidra Hoil and Aquetzali Garcia, who share the role of the Oracle Girl; their eerie voices ("You fear me? So you should, all you who are vile... would you like to know how you are going to die?") send shivers down your spine. The Indian village and the Mayan city are so convincingly portrayed that we can feel just what it would be like living in either place. And the haunting sound track helps to make us feel we're deep in the middle of 15th century meso-America.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, Apocalypto is a knockout film experience. Don't see it for its historical accuracy (inaccuracies abound in this movie); see it for what it is, a glorious action-adventure film that will keep you mesmerized from beginning to end.<br /><br />Judy Lind</p></body></html>

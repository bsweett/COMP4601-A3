<meta name="summary" content="Day-Lewis is brilliant."></head><body><p>Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Bill the Butcher as an blood hungry, beyond-twisted, knife-throwing crime lord with a sense of entitlement and a perverse respect for his adversaries practically steals Martin Scorsese's film. He's one of the best villains ever put on film. The movie itself is an involving, violent epic. It's ambitious, important and a departure from Scorsese's usual takes on New York's mean streets. The central scene involving Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz and a knife-throwing stage exhibition is the most tense one I saw this year, and the final scenes involving the Draft Riots, though historically inaccurate, are a startling and fitting conclusion. Because Scorsese is so good, this film will probably not go down as one of his best, yet, if anyone else had made this film, it'd be hailed as a complete masterpiece.</p></body></html>

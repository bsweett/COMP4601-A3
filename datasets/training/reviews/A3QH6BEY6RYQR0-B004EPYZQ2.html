<meta name="summary" content="Pure excitement!"></head><body><p>Some kids in a small Ohio town are filming a movie when they witness a train crash. Mysterious things begin to happen around town and the kids are right in the middle of all the occurrences. This is a very exciting science fiction drama that is sort of a cross between E.T. and Close Encounters. The acting, the visuals and the sound effects here are all top notch, and there is constant excitement throughout. The movie can be a little intense at times, so it may not be for children. If you are looking for pure escapism, and a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this is the one.</p></body></html>

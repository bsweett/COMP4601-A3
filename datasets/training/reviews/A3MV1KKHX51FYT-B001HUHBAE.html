<meta name="summary" content="The Story of a True Crime"></head><body><p>This film is based on actual facts. A young couple park where it quiet. Some shots ring out, but they remain parked. A car parks near by, and more shots are fired. Someone calls the police to report it. A letter from the killer arrives at the 'San Francisco Chronicle'. [Those other newspapers are extinct.] The cartoonist studies the cipher. The Zodiac killer strikes in daylight. [Never let yourself be tied up.] Then a cabdriver is shot in San Francisco. Another letter arrives at the newspaper with an insane threat. [The film reminds us of the old technology in use then.] Books tell about ciphers and codes. Why would anyone trust a stranger on a dark road? Reporter Paul Avery uncovers an old murder in Riverside California. Then a tip names a suspect. The police look at him, but have a problem. The Zodiac killer strikes again.<br /><br />Robert Graysmith researches the libraries to learn who borrowed books on codes. He is allowed the privilege of reviewing police files, and finds a clue. An anonymous phone call brings a new clue. After years have passed a new Zodiac letter appears. Why does Robert need to do this? He follows another clue about a poster. Robert is obsessed about this case. He finds some facts that point to a cleared suspect - only "circumstantial evidence". Then a long sought witness is found and identifies a photo. But the passage of time prevents any further action.<br /><br />The film recreates the Bay Area of California in the early 1970s. It seems slightly over-long, but seems to cover this unsolved case dramatically. They had four different actors portray the Zodiac killer, as if they hedged their bet about a single killer. Note the different MOs, and the false claims for murders that were untrue. Copycat killings are possible.</p></body></html>

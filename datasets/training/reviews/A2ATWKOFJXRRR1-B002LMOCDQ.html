Certainly not me! The fact that I hadn't seen the stage-play (by the same name) probably added to my surprise.<br /><br />Being no fan of that Swedish rock group of the 70s and 80s, I was doubly surprised to find myself enjoying this film so much. In no small measure was my enjoyment thanks to the all-star cast, no doubt, but also how well incorporated the songs were within the story.<br /><br />The story is worthy of a Shakespearean comedy with high confusion, paternal bonds in question, and lady-love finding its way into the audiences heart in unusual ways. The story, this time, revolves around Sophie (Amanda Seyfried, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X4O42I">House, M.D.</a>) and her desire to find her true father before her wedding. Stumbling upon her mother's diary, Sophie finds three candidates that might be her dad. Her mother Donna (Meryl Streep, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JSI7BM">The Devil Wears Prada</a>) has no idea that her daughter has invited three of her former loves to the wedding. And when they arrive, paternal sparks go a-flying, as do the flickers of old romances. Harry (Colin Firth) comes to the wedding out of fear that he'd done something and then left it undone (i.e., not properly fathering his daughter). Bill (Stellan Skarsgard, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000U7WV1Y">Pirates of the Caribbean - At World's End</a>) comes simply because he's curious. But Sam (Pierce Brosnan, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J10KVE">The Matador</a>) arrives with a burning love-gone-by for Donna. And when Donna finds out all three of these old flames have arrived for the wedding, chaos ensues ...mixed with some toe-tapping music (Gah! Toe-tapping to ABBA!).<br /><br />The other element to the story are two old work friends of Donna's (they were a trio of singers at one time) who arrive for the wedding and find Donna in a frazzled state. Rosie (Julie Walters, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZIZ0RU">Becoming Jane</a>) is the active and playful one with plenty of spunk, while Tanya (Christine Baranski) is the sexual over-achiever who has to fight off the advances of a few young island boys.<br /><br />Surprises abound as the movie winds down. One person comes out of the closet, while two others find love (even though one is running away from any possible commitment). Donna herself might find love in the arms of one of those old flames. And Sophie's wedding gets a change of venue.<br /><br />One of the final songs on the track ("Take a Chance on Me") is extremely funny and well thought-out. And as the credits roll, there's some laugh-out-loud moments as we get to watch Colin Firth try to dance in a skin-tight, sequined outfit (along with the other main players in the film).<br /><br />The final positive note for this movie has to be that the director Phyllida Lloyd was also responsible for MAMMA MIA's huge stage production success, and her translation of it from stage to silver screen was exceptionally well-rendered. This one's a surprisingly good film, even for those folks who aren't into ABBA.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Interesting Movie. Wonderful Music."></head><body><p>Last night's movie was "Sleepy Hollow." We bought it off the DVD bargain rack and I'm surprised to find it there. In a lot of ways, it's a really excellent movie. First, the filming is just wonderful and fit's the story so well. Those dark gloomy woods are wonderful and the film sites within the woods are just marvelous. A lot of efforts went into these sets, believe me. Costumes too. It's just a well done movie! And the accompanying music by Danny Elfman suits the background and story so well and is a pleasure to listen to in itself. While watching the film, I wondered if there was an available soundtrack. I checked and there is. It figures. I haven't checked, but I could easily imagine this movie gathering in a bunch of Academy Award nominations or other awards of that type. It's that good!<br /><br />Okay, so what do I think of the story? It's drivel. Anytime there's a lot of superstitions, rotting bodies, ghosts, a headless guy riding a black horse at night and looking for his head, well, my mind just goes blank. It's a pile of supernatural stuff and my mind just doesn't understand. I'm a realist. This movie is unmitigated gibberish. I have the same problem with religion. Give me a lot of supernatural hocus-pocus and my mind just turns off. I can't help it. But, it's a reconstruction of a highly acclaimed work of literature. It's been a classic fiction story way back from when I was an undergraduate fifty years ago. So, it's highly acclaimed drivel. It's still drivel. But, people love the story and just look at all the high ratings. Well, to each his or her own. I enjoy Star Trek and that's drivel too, but it's tongue-in-cheek drivel. This is serious drivel. What can I say? I'm sure the majority of people wound love this movie and it's so well done. My advice would be to see it and decide for yourselves. You may well enjoy it, even immensely.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

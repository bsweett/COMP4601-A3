<meta name="summary" content="Spiderman Returns & Better Than Ever"></head><body><p>Batman & Robin, Daredevil, The Hulk... All of these are examples of how not to make a comic book hero movie. Of the real 'Big 3' heroes out there, Batman and Superman of DC comics have had their big budget movies and have met with mixed success. Spider Man and Marvel themselves though have really never got off the ground as far as the silver screen goes... Until X-Men<br /><br />There's no denying that the success of the X-Men film and Marvel's documented financial difficulties are what allowed the studios to get their claws into these franchises and while Hulk and Daredevil may have been disappointments, Stan Lee was never going to let his flagship character suffer the same fate.<br /><br />Spider Man 1 was, in my opinion, the best superhero movie I had seen. The character stuck to the comic books, with a few minor exceptions(the webbing being the one that really bent the fanatics noses out of joint). The temptation to cast a Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt in the role was held at bay and some relatively unknown supporting members proved to be great in the from of Osbourne Jnr and Jameson.<br /><br />This was a sequel that had a lot to live up to... And boy did it deliver! Again, some of the origins were messed with, we all know Doc Ock was never a humanitarian or 'controlled' by his claws, he was evil of his own free will. Regardless, Molina was excellent as the villain, McGuire was still the dork he should have been and his wrestling with his alter ego really gave the movie the depth it needed.<br /><br />What makes Spiderman 2 a great movie is, not just the action sequences, but the realistic and believable relationships between the characters, with the exception of Jameson who is a welcome dose of 'over the top'. Osbourne's hatred for spider man slowly poisoning his friendship with Parker, Parker's love for MJ which he is forced to hide and MJ's pained frustration at Parker's refusal to open up, all add to the action we expect of this sort of movie.<br /><br />Then there is the action. Acrobatics, explosions, runaway trains, fights atop skyscrapers... This has them all. The set pieces are breathtaking and Spidey gets more than as good as he gets from Doctor Octopus. Molina may have been a less than orthodox action man, and the slight paunch evident at points supports that, but he pulled the role off magnificently.<br /><br />In wrapping up this review all I can say is the Spider Man 3 has some big boots to fill as this was a film that deserved all the box office records it broke and the DVD has some extras that really make it stand out as well</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dear Heloise: How do you remove blood stains from a bowling lane?"></head><body><p>Imagine "Citizen Kane" with petroleum replacing newspapers, and you have a pretty good idea of what "There Will Be Blood" is about. Whether it's a great film is debatable. But there's no question it's an absolute knockout -- for its acting, cinematography, and music.<br /><br />"There Will Be Blood" is another in Hollywood's long line of left-wing "I hate American society" films. I love such movies (we need them now more than ever), especially when they attack fundamental American values such as greed, hypocrisy, materialism, and shallow religiosity. This one strikes with a Panzer division and cruise missiles.<br /><br />The meaning of the title is not altogether clear. I interpret it as the second part of the statement "Whenever a great deal of money is involved, there will be blood." Take it as you like.<br /><br />Though Daniel Day-Lewis's performance has been widely praised, it is, to some degree, one-note "Spock" acting with little variation in tone. Worse, he sounds as if he's channeling Jack Palance. (Other people hear John Huston.) And when Paul Dano (in an otherwise fine performance) goes into a squeally fit, he sounds like Gene Wilder groveling in front of Zero Mostel. It's surprising the director failed to catch and fix these problems, which grow increasingly irritating.<br /><br />The cinematography is not irritating. "There Will Be Blood" is one of the best-photographed color films I've ever seen. I particularly like the way detail is retained in bright backgrounds, without burning them out. The music score is also exceptional, totally "wrong", yet absolutely perfect, even the use of a terrible performance of the Brahms violin concerto (Sophe-Mutter + HvK).<br /><br />One obvious question might be... Given the subject matter, is "There Will Be Blood" as good as "Citizen Kane"? Nope, because the latter is (surprisingly) a far more audacious film. And Welles had the genius to add the "Rosebud" riddle, which keeps the audience interested.<br /><br />Given the highly positive critical response to "There Will Be Blood", you should read a review from a right-wing critic who not only detested the film, but utterly missed its obvious (and to be fair, heavy-handed) points. Amazon doesn't permit URLs, but go to the Wikipedia article for the film and click on footnote 31, to read Armond White's review.<br /><br />"There Will Be Blood" would barely rank a PG rating, if it weren't for a brutal (though not particularly graphic) murder near the end. Whether it's enough to justify an R, I don't know. But it's the kind of film teenagers /ought/ to see (especially those belonging to Young Republicans), so parents shouldn't hesitate to let them watch.<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer is magnificent, of almost-demo quality.</p></body></html>

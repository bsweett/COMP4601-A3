<meta name="summary" content="Worthwhile film, but lacking in authenticity"></head><body><p>I was aware of the plot of this ambitious Steven Spielberg film.  It's based on the real drama of the assassination of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972.  What followed was revenge killings secretly supported by the Israeli government of the 11 known Palestinian assassins.  This aftermath is what this film is about.<br /><br />And so there is international intrigue and bloodshed and lots of money being changed hands for information.  What's never clear, however, is how the informants got the information.  Lots of other important details were never clear either.  And as we are watching the bumbling of the assassinations, the compromise the assassins had to make and the possibility of some of the wrong people being murdered, the whole film played out as a discourse on the morality of it all.  This took almost three hours and I must say that I found myself glancing at my watch.<br /><br />Eric Bana was cast as the team leader of the five Israelis sent on this mission.  He's a good actor and did a fine job as did most of the cast.  But with the exception of the actor cast as the bomb maker, none of them looked Jewish, leading to a loss of authenticity.  Also, as far as authenticity goes, if a film is set in an international venue, I expect the languages spoken to reflect that.  Yes, there were a few subtitles here and there, but mostly all the actors spoke English.  Some of this made me wince.  I was also surprised to see that not one scene was shot in Israel.<br /><br />I understood the moral choices early on.  After that it was just scene after scene of one kind of compromise after another.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  I think there is a time and a place and a reason to debate the consequences of violence begetting violence.  This is the stuff of Talmudic discourses.  However, I'm not sure if this film succeeded in this mission.  We saw a lot of bombs exploding, gunshot wounds, and people being hurt.  And at the end of the film we knew that the hero would never be free of fear of reprisals.<br /><br />This is a worthwhile film.  There is no doubt in my mind about that.  And yet it lacks so much that I hesitate to recommend it.</p></body></html>

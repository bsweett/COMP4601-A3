<meta name="summary" content="Kutcher's got the goods-- who knew?"></head><body><p>The Butterfly Effect (Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber, 2004)<br /><br />Bress and Gruber, the scriptwriters for Final Destination 2, deliver their directorial debut with one of the worst casting decisions of all time, Ashton Kutcher (That 70's Show) in a dramatic role.<br /><br />Or so it seemed.<br /><br />Kutcher is actually one of the best things about this movie. Like Jamie Foxx in Any Given Sunday, an actor who's nauseatingly annoying in comedies gets put into a drama and shows that he does, in fact, have talent.<br /><br />The first half of the film, which despite the above doesn't feature Kutcher, is told in flashback form as we meet the main character, Evan Treborn (played variously by Kutcher, Unbreakable bit player John Patrick Amadori, and Logan Lerman of The Patriot, Riding in Cars with Boys, etc.) at three separate times in his life. He's your typical unpopular schoolkid with a very small group of friends, a similarly messed up brother and sister, Tommy (William Lee Scott/Jesse James/Cameron Bright) and Kaylee (Amy Smart/Irene Gorovaia/Sarah Widdows) Martin, and the fat kid, Lenny (Eldon Hensen/Kevin Schmidt/Jake Karese). Evan suffers from odd blackouts throughout his life, and also various other things, like the Martins' dad (played menacingly by the always-fun Eric Stoltz) being an abusive pedophile, and his own father (Callum Keith Rennie, recently in Torso, eXistenZ, and Memento) being locked up in a mental institution for suffering from the same thing Evan does.<br /><br />Let me make sure you understand this: the setup is fantastic. Everything is laid out perfectly for the massive payoff. Sure, a few things are a little too pat (Martin, for example, is stereotyped to the point of silliness), and it's obvious that they're setting you up for the massive payoff. But that makes it no less enjoyable.<br /><br />The movie, however, starts to go downhill when it snaps back to the present. It goes from being a good thriller to something of an episode of Quantum Leap. To be short, the payoff is simply not as good as the buildup was; it's as if they had this idea, worked out how to get to it, then got there and realized there was no creative energy left.<br /><br />Maybe I'm being a bit too harsh. Some parts of the present-day storyline work just fine. They don't leave any loose ends around. Things are still a little too pat (the stereotyping of Evan's mother during one scene is so stupid it makes Eric Stoltz's character look like something out of Sartre), especially when you get to the ending (which takes the message of a popular classic film-- to say which one would give it away-- and turns it on its head), which is way too "man, that's the way things SHOULD have happened" to be anything but a cheap trick. And the idea itself is extremely interesting, and could be done far better, were anyone to come up with a good way to do it (it's been done in novels and in short form, but I don't think a feature film has ever quite pulled it off).<br /><br />All in all, some good things, some bad things. Probably worth a rental just to marvel at the idea Ashton Kutcher really can act. Lord knows we've never seen him do it before. ** ?</p></body></html>

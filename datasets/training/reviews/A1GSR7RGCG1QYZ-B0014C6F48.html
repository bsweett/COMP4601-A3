She is tired of the jokes and the unpopularity, and desires to be "thirty, flirty, and thriving".  Her dream is about to come true.  Due to a incident with her friend Matt and some biological "wishing dust", Jenna is transformed to her life 17 years later.  Unfortunately, it isn't what she dreamed it would be.  She has lost touch with her friends, family, and is an untrustworthy person in the office.  She loves to drink, cheat, and lie.  This is not the life she imagined.  Now Jenna has the chance to make it all change and to live the life that she has always dreamed about.  Will she have the time to change everything or will life's little consequences keep her from changing her future?<br /><br />This film failed on many levels.  Not only were we forced to watch an actress that couldn't quite nail her part, but we also had to listen to her attempt a high-pitched voice throughout the whole hour and a half.  We are left with themes left unexplored and a mismatched message sent to our viewers.  Jenna, before her change into a teenager, was a very sinister woman.  What happened to this woman?  Did she just suddenly disappear when "teenage" Jenna awoke?  I needed more answers to this question, yet none were provided.  Secondly, I was not impressed with the message that was made during this film.  What I witnessed was a woman that could not handle the stress of "real life", so she attempts to find an alternate route using "magic dust".  This is pathetic.  I realize that a message needed to be created, but it should not have been this far based from reality.  There were no connections made to any of the characters, the emotion was drab, and the acting was well below expectations to say the least.  The only redeeming factor in this film is Mark Ruffalo who gives the best performance by just wandering through this open void known as 13 Going on 30.<br /><br />Overall, I say skip it.  Hollywood has been producing these carbon copy films for years and unless we begin "skipping" them soon, we will be forced to watch them again and again and again.<br /><br />Grade:  * ? out of ****</p></body></html>

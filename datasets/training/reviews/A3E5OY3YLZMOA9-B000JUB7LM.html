Besides whatever wrong technical facts about Maggie's hospital stay I think this is a perfect and realistic story. Yes it was depressing but there are plenty of real people with worse stories that never got anything good in life. Though Maggie had an unfair life she kept a smile on her face and still worked hard to get where she wanted to be. She was tough and fought with no regrets. She may have not had the family she wanted but at least she got to fight and be important to someone. Basically the first time you watch this film you should watch it for the story not hunting for technical rights and wrongs. If you can get by that it's very enjoyable.</p></body></html>

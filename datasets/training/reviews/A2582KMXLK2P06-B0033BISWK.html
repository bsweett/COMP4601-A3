<meta name="summary" content="wow, good stuff!"></head><body><p>District 9 is a surprisingly awesome science fiction/adventure type movie focusing around alien invasions, violent annihilations, communication with alien creatures and of course, saving planet earth.<br /><br />What makes District 9 distinctly different from most alien films is that it focuses around getting to know the aliens by way of one British man (the main character of the film) getting to win over the admiration of the aliens, gradually, through lots of intense shooting and violence as soon as he realizes how unfair they've been treated.<br /><br />When a spaceship suddenly appears in the skies of Johannesburg one day, alien creatures then invade the entire city.  The people of Johannesburg desperately try to contain the aliens by using holding centers for the tame ones, and lots of heavy artillery for the more aggressive aliens, but of course, the aliens are reluctant to do what the people want, and of course, the aliens are there in the first place because they're on a mission.  Hey, you didn't really think the aliens would arrive on earth because they wanted to take a vacation did you?  A happy place to go just to get away from all the hectic everyday universe activity?  Yeah, haha.<br /><br />Anyway, it was a VERY pleasant twist to give viewers an alien movie where they communicate amongst themselves and with the people of earth.  I'm talking lengthy, detailed segments devoted to actual conversations- not just snippets here and there.  A very nice change of pace from the typical alien movies we normally see.<br /><br />Furthermore, the storytelling was never exaggerated to the point of total confusion.  It's easy to grasp the concept because the writing was never once hard to comprehend.<br /><br />Overall, the only negative is that the first 10 minutes are devoted to fictional interviews with people in a lame attempt to try and explain the alien invasions (making it very cheesy and ineffective as far as creating a moving atmosphere is concerned) but other than a slow and somewhat irrelevant start, I was mightily impressed with the quality of the writing, the presentation, the acting and how easy it was to understand the events taking place.  A great movie.  It reminds me of War of the Worlds to an extent (another movie I greatly admire).</p></body></html>

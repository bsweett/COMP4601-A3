<meta name="summary" content="An Extraordinary Climax! (Part 4 of 8)"></head><body><p>The nightmares are getting worse and the scar is burning pictures of the dark lord in the mind of Harry Potter. Not even going back to Hogwarts, The Quidditch World Cup or even his huge crush of Ravenclaw seeker Cho Chang can keep these dark images away. Now suddenly Harry is about to face his toughest challenge in the Triwizard Tournament, as a mysterious 4th champion. He will face off against the Proud Victor Krum of Durmstrang School of magic, the fair Fluer DeLacour of Beaubaxtons magicical institute and his fellow student the popular Cedric Diggory.<br /><br />'The Goblet of Fire' is the best in the saga by far. The tagline says...'Everything Is Going To Change'. As the climax of the Harry Potter saga, the film was true to its word. This movie is far from the previous three. It has a PG-13 rating, ranging hormones and very disturbing ending. Still what made this movie so amazing was the work that was done to finally bring to life the one character that every fan has been wondering and waiting to see. Of course I am speaking about the Dark Lord Voldemort. Casting Ralph Finnes was the perfect choice, because he knows how to be the villain as you have seen in his previous work. His performance left me speechless and the fact he didn't even get nominated for a supporting actors Oscar shocked me...well at least Jake Gylenhall didn't get it either. Also the adding of Miranda Richardson and Brendan Gleason was also great. The regulars of the cast also did a fantastic job.<br /><br />What made me so happy about this new movie was the writers and new Director Mike Newell really looked at the past films and now thanks to the disaster of Azkaban, the right things were cut and added, the bonds of friendship were forged again and the cast finally played the correct rolls rather than just standing there for comic relief. As this first piece of the story comes to a close the stage is set for 'Order of the Phoenix'. With a darker chapter and a new director in the chair I am hoping that the last three films keep the fire that this film created.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="In terms of pure filmmaking, this film is a masterpiece...."></head><body><p>If you jettison the politics of this movie (and Stone's reputation as a muckracker), and simply look at JFK as a film, it's arguably Oliver Stone's best film and it is absolutely rivetting.  It's a masterpiece of cinemtography, editing, writing, and performances.  I've only seen the initial 189 minute theatrical version, and that film is my favorite Oliver Stone film.  Stone's scope of this project is incredible.  He not only makes an epic about the JFK assassination, but he makes it so fascinating and enthralling that you marvel as his talents as a filmmaker.  The cinematography here is astounding.  Robert Richardson shoots in 35mm, 8mm, and 16mm, color, black and white, tinted color, tinted black and white, and it all blends seamlessly.  The editing on this monster is also a marvel (it deservedly won an Oscar for editing).  The film has a ton of cuts (something in films I don't like), but Stone and his editors do wonders with it.  The performances deserve special mention as well.  Costner is very effective as Jim Garrison, the New Orleans prosecutor who believed in the conspiracy of JFK's assassination.  Costner does a New Orleans accent very well, much better than his rather pathetic "English" one for Robin Hood:  Prince of Thieves.  There are numerous cameos in the film, but they don't feel like cameos.  Stone manages to make each actor/character unique and interesting.  It never feels like star spotting.  Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland, Joe Pesci, and Ed Asner (as a right wing demogagoue, which is funny considering Asner is a very left wing liberal) are standouts in a magnificent cast.<br /><br />When you watch this film, think of it as "Stone's interpretation of the JFK assassination".  There are numerous discrepancies here (such as Garrison meeting with Mr. X, played by Sutherland.  That never happened), but if you look at this film strictly as a film, it's remarkable and worthy of the accolades it has received over the years.  It's one of Oliver Stone's most memorable films, and a reminder of what a great director he can be when he's on.</p></body></html>

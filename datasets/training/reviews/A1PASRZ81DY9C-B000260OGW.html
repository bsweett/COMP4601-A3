That's because Open Range featured well-respected actors which helped to prolong its dying life. It's almost like watching Unforgiven, and I liked the human elements involved in Open Range. They made the performances and the story more sincere and interesting. The twenty somewhat minutes involving the much cliched "O.K Corral" shootout is clearly better done than Pale Rider. However, the final ten minutes was too long for me and should have been cut off. Just end it and move on. Never been a fan of Annette Bening, she surprisingly matures in her role and gives a decent performance in Open Range. Robert Duvall is at his wonted best, and that's why I will always love his body of work. Kevin Costner, once again, takes the helm as a director amid a couple of bombs in the 90's and finally goes back to the same roots in what made Dances with Wolves a memorable picture. Many, including me, were very apprehensive about him pulling a Michael Cimino, but this was a pleasant treat for me. Granted, he is a talented director that sure knows how to charm the audience. Of course, Unforgiven is a much superior film to Open Range in so many ways, but that doesn't stop me from liking it. All in all, Open Range makes a fine addition to the Western genre and is a delight to watch.</p></body></html>

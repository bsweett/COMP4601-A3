<meta name="summary" content="Cute, Lite Romantic/Corporate Satire"></head><body><p>In Good Company is a fine movie that delivers just about what it needs to deliver to keep us all entertained, though it is unlikely that, once seen, you'll feel any compelling need to see it again. Unlike other recent films/shows that poke fun at corporate life such as Office Space or The Office, In Good Company never really seems willing to take off the gloves or throw its haymaker. Yes--there is a little ribbing on use of buzz words and concepts, such as "synergy," and the one corporate kiss-up who gets his just desserts in the end, but In Good Company is too interested in its human tale to ever really stick it to the suits like we all know they deserve.<br /><br />And then, in the romantic angle, again In Good Company feels a little milquetoast, strange to say. The romance which drives the plot from mid-way to the end doesn't ever feel compelling; it tugs no heartstrings, and the ending is weak and unsatisfying on this score, too.<br /><br />The best thing about the film has to be how it presents both Dennis Quaid's and Topher Grace's characters sympathetically and as real people. We understand them both, and their conflicts, and root for them both throughout. There are a lot of movies that unfairly only show one side of a conflict, and In Good Company keeps clear of that failing.<br /><br />In the end, an enjoyable movie to watch, and good for a date in an established, comfortable relationship (find something more romantic for the first or second dates, if possible). We won't be quoting it in two years time, watching it in five or remembering it in ten, but for today, it's decent fare.</p></body></html>

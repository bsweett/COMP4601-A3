<meta name="summary" content="It's Good, It's Good"></head><body><p>Requiem for a dream is about four different people who's lives go through hell just to be happy at the end but thats how I see it and maybe you will too. The first Character Harry wants to sell drugs for a living but of course selling drugs in New York City is not easy because everybody sells Here.The Second character is Marion Harry's Girlfriend will do anything for drugs even sleep with other men to get it.The third character is Tyrone who's Harry's Best Friend and helps harry sell drugs but things don't look good for him when he gets arrested.Then their's the last character with the strongest Proformance in the movie Harry's mother who loves her son as much as TV she always wanted to be on it and finally gets her chance but she also wants to look good on tv so she goes to the doctor to see how can she lose weight and he gives her pills to do that but the problem is she starts to get addictive to it.The end of the film you'll have to see for yourself and sometimes it is kind of boring but thats just a very small portion but other wise then that it's a must see so buy it now.</p></body></html>

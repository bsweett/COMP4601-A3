Long anticipated but frequently dismissed as "Gibson's Folly," the movie opened at #1 but ticket receipts quickly plummeted.  That's a pity,for while there are indeed a number of excellent films to choose from this holiday season, few of them are as good as this one.  Yes, it is violent--extremely violent.  But this is not the visceral near-pornography of a bad horror movie--the violence of APOCALYPTO serves a vision of cinematic artistry, and if certain scenes are not easy to watch, the film as a whole remains impossible to turn away from.<br /><br />Set in the ancient Mayan Empire on the brink of discovery by the white man, APOCALYPTO is the story of Jaguar Paw, a young hunter of the forest who is loving husband, father, and son.  He and his family and friends live peacefully in the depths of a great forest until the tranquility of their sheltered existence is pitilessly wiped out by a band of brutal marauders led by the bestial Zero Wolf.  Taken into captivity and brought to the city to be sacrificed to the Mayan gods, Jaguar Paw escapes into the dark jungle, determined to return to his wife and son and make a new beginning for themselves.  It is, like Joseph Conrad's immortal novella, a quest into the very heart of darkness, and Jaguar Paw and his world will never be the same again.<br /><br />Taut, engrossing, and incredibly thrilling, APOCALYPTO delivers on many levels.  As an action movie alone it is a success, but that ignores the thoughtfulness and care that has gone into the script and direction.  This is one of those stories that can perhaps be interpreted in many equally valid terms, and the parallels between the Babylonesque Mayan culture and our own are indeed frightening.  Gibson deserves much praise for his artistic vision--something few contemporary directors seem to have--but it would be a crime not to likewise praise his cast.  Rudy Youngblood is exceptional and empathetic as the benighted Jaguar Paw, and Dalia Hernandez is just as good as his young wife, whose own subplot of self-discovery, courage and faith is a vital element of the broader story.  Raoul Trujillo's Zero Wolf is one of the great villains of movie history, and to put it mildly you have to love to hate him.  The supporting players are well-rounded and handle their various roles believably and uniformly well--the cast as a whole may be unknown, but unknown or not, they're very good.<br /><br />Thriller, drama, social commentary--all these things and more, APOCALYPTO is a tribute to the power of story and its power to capture the essence of reality.  Certainly not for everyone, APOCALYPTO is at times painful to watch, and children definitely do not need to be exposed to it.  Even so, APOCALYPTO is a grand achievement, and impossible not to recommend to discerning adults.</p></body></html>

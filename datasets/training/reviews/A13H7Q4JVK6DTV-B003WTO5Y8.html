<meta name="summary" content="Now I know why it won best picture"></head><body><p>Now this movie is really good and is not just the creep moments you get from watching it,the parts when clarice and lecter have conversations on who is killing girls arcoss america, makes you want more. The movie is long and very interesting because Clarice has to get information out of a psychopath to help her catch a man name buffalo bill who is skining girls for a reason ,but you'll have to fine out yourself why he does that.<br />The special Edition comes with lots stuff ,but watching the movie is enough if you ask me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A promise of life everlasting"></head><body><p>In the opening scene of the film (that is, after the initial explanation of the fairy tale we are about to be involved in) we see Ofelia with her mother, heading toward the camp of her mother's new husband, the Captain. Ofelia is carrying some books close to her chest, bundled in twine. Her mother inquires as to what they are, and upon seeing that the books are fairy tales, admonishes Ofelia, telling her that she is too old for such fancies.<br /><br />My immediate reaction was: nobody is too old for fairy tales. That this is true is inescapable. The writers of fairy tales are largely adults.<br /><br />Ofelia's life at the Captain's camp is a terrible one. The Captain cares nothing for anyone but himself, and has passion only for defending Spain against rebel forces (Star Wars anyone? - j/k). Only one thing separates him from being the embodiment of evil: his love for the son (so he believes with certainty) his wife is carrying. One could question the validity of that love, and say it is more pride than anything, but I'll leave that alone.<br /><br />He certainly does not love his new wife, nor his step-daughter. Upon Carmen's arrival (Ofelia's mother), she is put in a wheelchair and confined to bed, in a room the Captain enters only if there is an emergency.<br /><br />Without a mother (for the pregnancy is a difficult one), without a father, and without any friends, Ofelia begins to have adventures. She is told by a mysterious (and quite evil looking) faun that she is a princess, heir to a great kingdom where sickness and death will never visit her. For a girl so alone, and so in love with or enamored by fairies, she is easily led into the faun's "game". He has assignments for her, things she must complete before the next full moon, when the portal will be open and she will return to the kingdom forever.<br /><br />For her second assignment, she visits what is surely one of the most horrid creatures - a killer, and eater, of children. The creature itself is stunningly original and terrifying.<br /><br />The faun offers Ofelia a mandrake root for her assistance (she is rooting out evil, in a sense), and the mandrake root is to be placed in a bowl of milk under her mother's bed, fed with two drops of blood a day. Ofelia receives the mandrake, follows the instructions, and her mother immediately improves. It is revealing (I won't say why) that when the mandrake is thrown into the fire he/it screams. If you haven't seen it, think on that scene when you do. If you already have - reconsider it, and its placement. I believe that scene alone holds the most important truth in the film.<br /><br />It's difficult, to say the least, to tell a "two-pronged" story, one set firmly in realism, the other in a questionable fantasy. These could not be more different. But Guillermo del Toro manages it with seamless finesse. I never felt manipulated or jolted moving from one realm to the other. That is testimony to a great film - and a great filmmaker.</p></body></html>

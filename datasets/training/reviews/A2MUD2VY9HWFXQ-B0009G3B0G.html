However, "The Jacket" proves to be an intoxicating standout of the emerging genre.<br /><br />1991. Gulf war veteran Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) has had it pretty rough lately. While in Iraq, Sgt. Jack Starks experienced himself quite a dandy head injury. After being shipped back to the states with some sort of shock related head trauma, we come to find Jack wandering a snowy cold highway. He comes across a car, apparently broken down, with a mother and a young daughter seemingly stranded by the side of the road. Mommas not looking to good, and she hardly acknowledges Jacks presence. Jack does meet daughter Jackie, and offers to help fix the car while Jackie tends to Mommy, who's now puking in the bushes. After repairing the car and giving cute little Jackie his dog tags, Momma flies into an outburst and hurriedly drives away with daughter in tow.<br /><br />Jack is able to hitch a ride from another fellow, but that is the last thing he remembers before facing trial for the murder of a state trooper. Due to his head trauma and experience in the Gulf War, Jack is declared "insane" and sent to a state psychiatric hospital. There is he is subjected to an experimental process by Dr. Thomas Becker (Kris Kristofferson), who pumps him full of psychiatropic drugs, straps him in a full body straight jacket, and slides him in a morgue drawer for hours at a time. During these sessions, Jack is forced to live through a series of hallucinations, realities, and events- some of which have not taken place just quite yet.<br /><br />2007. As the audience, we get to see what happens years later, as Jack is reunited (coincidence?) with a now adult Jackie. Seems Jackie (a fantastic Keira Knightley) has become quite the shadow of her own mother. She's a chain smoking, boozing, angry and depressed young woman with the demons of her past haunting her each day. Through a series of encounters the two begin to grow fond of each other & begin to unravel what exactly has happened to Jack between 1991 - 2007, which he has no recollection of -for  the most part.<br /><br />"The Jacket" is quite a compelling film. Brody and Knightley shine through the darkness that they are surrounded in. A nice subplot with Jennifer Jason Leigh as one of the institutions doctors helps the film come full circle.<br /><br />"The Jacket" will leave you moved and satisfied by the time it wraps up.<br />Sad but touching, the movie goes not exactly where you expect it to- but instead right where you hoped it would.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

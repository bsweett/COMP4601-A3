<meta name="summary" content="Love that 30-40s Era of Sci-Fi and Pulps"></head><body><p>As a fan of both Sci-fi and pulps from the 1930s & 1940s, I was delighted by Sky Captain.<br /><br />Jude Law was probably not the most "authentic" choice for the types of heros in serials and pulps back then (think DOC SAVAGE and the SHADOW, FLASH GORDEN, etc...).. but did an OK job.<br /><br />The 99% CGI generated world with the Art Deco feel and atmosphere and color filters are fun.<br /><br />Like the Serials and Pulps of the era, the plot is kept simple, the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad... the action is the main theme.<br /><br />Basically SKY CAPTAIN is not to be taken too serious.... it is basically a comic book, Amazing Stories Sci-FI mag and/or a Golden Era Pulp from the 30-40s brought to life.<br /><br />For that I like it.</p></body></html>

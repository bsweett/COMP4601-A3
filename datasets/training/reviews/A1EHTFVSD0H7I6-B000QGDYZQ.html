One person detests a work that another finds fresh and amazing.<br /><br />Go figure.<br /><br />I like Sandra Bullock. So I think I'm looking at Premonition through that mindset. I also love suspense and twisty plots. Bullock plays a solid character like she does in each of her films - a woman facing circumstances with varying degrees of self-control and courage. Linda reminded me of Bullock's character in Crash.<br /><br />The plot had intriguing moments. Daily activities filled with quiet desperation set the scene for an unraveling marriage. Linda's realization of impending tragedy and then the cloud of surreality that surrounded her as she lived one very different day at a time made the movie clip along. The filming tended to be stark and clean which added to the suspense feel and evoked a sense of loneliness.<br /><br />None of the characters were particularly lovable, even the children took a bit to warm up to.<br /><br />The element of faith ended up being an empty platitude.<br /><br />If you hated Lake House -- don't even try with Premonition.<br /><br />If you are a mistake collector and will likely see the movie with a spread sheet and try to make all the parts create a seamless whole, I don't see how that's going to happen...so don't go there.<br /><br />If you have to have a big smile on your face when you shut off a movie...I don't think this will give you what you're looking for.<br /><br />I could call it an interesting relationship study or a suspenseful hand-holding movie that leaves you with questions to ponder.</p></body></html>

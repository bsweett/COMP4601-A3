<meta name="summary" content="Better than I expected, but not great!"></head><body><p>I have to admit that the movie delivered more than what I had expected. The special effects were excellent with minimal use of CGI (I think....) and the storyline does have connections with the original alien quadrilogy as well as the predator saga. Expecially the Weiland corporation and it's owner were keys to tie this film to the alien ones. There were a few shortcomings however; The acting of the italian archeologist was poor, the change in interior ambiance of the predator ship compared to the one seen in Predator2 and the fact that some of their stabbing weapons melted, when in contact with the alien blood, but some of them didn't were puzzling. Also the use of the alien skull as a shield would have been impossible because the acid would have burned the girl's arm. Otherwise I did enjoy this movie and it was intense and bloody enough to keep me tense. Overall: GOOD.</p></body></html>

When you and your date would jump at the same time. And you would see some people covering their eyes, so as not to jump the next time.<br /><br />Yes this movie is a supernatural tale. And it is scary. There is more then one part that will make you jump. And that is what I like about this movie. It can scare you without all the unnecessary violence and blood. The level of expectation is kept up throughout the whole movie. It kept my suspense level almost peaked the entire movie.<br /><br />The story is well written. It gives you time to think. And the horror seems to never end. Just keeps coming and coming...it will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />I would recommend watching this in a dark room with friends. Those who scream and jump will just add to the suspense for you.</p></body></html>

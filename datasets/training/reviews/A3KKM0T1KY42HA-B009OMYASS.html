<meta name="summary" content="House of Wax With Paris Hilton Was More Believable"></head><body><p>The title of this review, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I5XOV4">House of Wax</a> With Paris Hilton Was More Believable", says it all, no? It's hard to understand why Tarantino would so prominently attach his name to Hostel.<br /><br />Hostel is no Pulp Fiction. Hostel doesn't even come close to the Tarantino-produced 1996 Vampire classic, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RJ74">From Dusk Till Dawn</a>.<br /><br />Hostel is a movie about a whole town that doesn't seem to notice that a giant abandoned factory has been converted into a torture chamber where the wealthy pay to mutilate people for fun. Who knew that there was such a demand for this kind of entertainment by the upper echelons of society!?<br /><br />The story is the simple tale of what happens when a few B-actors acting like B-actors get abducted to be victims for the sadistic masses that patronize the torture factory.<br /><br />There is gore-o-plenty. If you're into scenes of torture you won't be disappointed here.<br /><br />All in all, it's a ridiculously conceived plot line with gratuitous gore. The thrills are few...suspense is about a 0. You could watch this movie without sound all the way through and still have the same experience as if the sound is on. The movie is mostly a visual yuck-fest.<br /><br />Want a good alternative that has a story and *a lot* less gore than you probably think? Go with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EOTVU2">Wolf Creek</a>.</p></body></html>

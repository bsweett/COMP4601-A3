<meta name="summary" content="PRETTY GOOD FIRST PERFORMANCE"></head><body><p>This movie turned out to be a whole lot better than I thout it was going to be. In most movies that star rappers the rappers usually over play their role and try to be super hard, in this movie Eminem played it pretty cool and turned out a great performance.<br /><br /> The extras on this DVD are top notch, the battles, the music video,and all of the music in the movie are all available. Good stuff.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hairspray (2007) Movie Review"></head><body><p>Delightfully corny with a charming look that boasts the razzle-dazzle style of Hollywood musicals from a bygone era, Hairspray could be the most fantastic Broadway adaptation since Grease. The surprisingly exciting picture won't just keep your hair in a flashy do, it will hold audiences attention from the first note of its energetic opening song, "Good Morning Baltimore" right through its whiz bang finale.<br /><br />Based on the John Waters' 1988 film turned Broadway musical, the 2007 adaptation of Hairspray may not be as politically charged as its predecessor, but the reaffirmation of today's cultural values, plus a campy look at an era of lost innocence, should enchant audiences into falling in love with the material all over again. Captivated by the Corny Collins Show, a sixties dance program on a local Baltimore television channel, young Tracy Turnblad (Niki Blonsky) spends her hours keeping her perfect hairdo at attention while daydreaming of dancing on the television program and winning over one of the show's hunkiest young stars. Despite the disapproval of her mother Edna, played by superstar John Travolta in drag, Tracy's father, Wilbur (Christopher Walken), encourages his daughter to audition for the show, because in America after all "you have got to think big to be big".<br /><br />And big is exactly how to describe Hairspray. The gorgeous, pastel colored back lot sets are big, the dance numbers are big, and even Travolta's fat suit is big! Sans the wailing divas and in your face editing of past Oscar worthy musicals, Hairspray follows its daring lead character in celebrating being different. Director-Choreographer Adam Shankman approaches Hairspray with the appreciation of a veteran Broadway performer, showcasing the grand spectacle of it all instead of trying to overwhelm audiences with flashy and gimmicky editing tricks. Though his surprisingly formulaic style failed in his previous directorial efforts like The Pacifier and Cheaper by the Dozen 2, Shankman seems to be at home with a period piece set in 1962, recreating a feel from Hollywood's golden era.<br /><br />Unlike The Producers, another recent picture adapted from a musical originally based on a film, the witty screenplay penned by Leslie Dixon, brings out the director and casts' comedic timing and skill, giving Hairspray some big laughs. While the romantic pairing of Travolta and an underused Christopher Walken is uproarious, it disappointingly caters to cheeky humor that is funny for nothing more than the fact that one of the famous actors is in drag.<br /><br />Luckily the young talent that populates most of the film is absolutely delightful. Amanda Bynes, Elijah Kelley and Zac Efron all deliver solid and entertaining performances, but the real find in Hairspray comes in the form of the pleasantly plump, yet undeniably adorable Nikki Blonsky. Working in Cold Stone Creamery merely one year ago, the unknown actress with no experience besides a handful of high school musicals explodes on screen in Hairspray with a memorable debut performance that should finally steal some thunder away from last year's sluggish Dreamgirls.<br /><br />With old Hollywood charm and flair Hairspray should delight audiences across the country with its quirky style and laughable medleys reaffirming that being different is a good thing. With enough subtle raunchiness to please fans of the John Water's original, plus big performances and spectacularly fun dance numbers that should cater to Broadway aficionados, Hairspray should be just the product theaters need to get that extra pouf in their summer box office sales.<br /><br />-Joe Russo</p></body></html>

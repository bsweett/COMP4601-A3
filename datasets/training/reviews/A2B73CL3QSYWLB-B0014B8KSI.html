I thought the legal arena on film had been definitely tackled by Sidney Lumet's "The Verdict" some 25 years ago.  Boy, was I wrong!  Without entering a courtroom except for a filmed deposition this film casts a jaundiced eye on the legal profession that knocks you for a loop.  The film centers on a prestigious law firm as it prepares the defense of a multi-national in a class action lawsuit.  Michael Clayton(George Clooney) is the firms fixer, a lawyer who handles the more unsavory aspects of a case without sullying the firm's reputation.  Though Clayton is a flawed individual he starts to have doubts about his activities.  This is heightened when a manic-depressive colleague(Tom Wilkinson) who is the chief defender in the lawsuit begins to display erratic behavior.  Clayton is not so much redeemed in this film but he wants to erradicate some of the muck that he wallows in.  This is bar none Clooney's best performance.  He's called on here to play a seriously flawed person and yet engender sympathy from the audience.  It's not a mannered work but a carefully modulated one.  The real revelation here is Wilkinson, though.  Many actors have chewed the scenery playing characters with mental problems but Wilkinson plumbs the depth of Arthur to deliver a highly sympathetic and humane performance.  Judging Wilkinson's work here I would have given him the Oscar over Javier Bardem in "No Country for Old Men".  By an eyelash.  The late Sydney Pollack delivers a fitting epitaph to a storied career as the straight-talking senior partner.  Judging from her work here I was a little puzzled by the Oscar Tilda Swinton won.  She's certainly good but there's nothing earth shattering about her performance.  My guess it was more of a body of work thing.</p></body></html>

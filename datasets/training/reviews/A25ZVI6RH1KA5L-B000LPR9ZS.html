Based on a screenplay by Leigh Whannell (Saw, Saw II), Saw III was directed by Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw II), and features Tobin Bell (Mississippi Burning, The Quick and the Dead) reprising his role as Jigsaw, the methodical master of malicious mayhem.  Also appearing is Shawnee Smith (The Blob), Angus Macfadyen (Cradle Will Rock), Bahar Soomekh (Crash), Donnie `Donnie D' Wahlberg (Dreamcatcher), Dina Meyer (Starship Troopers), and 1980s B movie favorite Betsy Russell (Private School, Tomboy), whose fianc&eacute; Mark Burg happened to be one of the numerous producers on the film, in a minor role.<br /><br />The third installment picks up where the last one left off as we see detective Eric Matthews (Wahlberg) in a familiar situation (familiar, at least, to someone who's seen the previous films), in a dank, grimy, dimly lit room, his leg shackled to a pipe, a rusty hacksaw within reach.  What follows is pretty wild (and messy), as Eric manages an escape, but not the way you might expect.  After this there's some bits with Eric's colleague Detective Kerry (Meyer), to which we move along into the story proper as we meet an attractive ER doctor named Lynn (Soomekh), whose life seems fraught with misery and despair, despite the appearance of having it all.  Anyway, after she's kidnapped by a figure donning a hog head, she finds herself in the Guru of Gristle's lair, a large, funky looking warehouse with intermittent lighting, filled to the brim with all kinds of wicked looking devices.  Lynn soon learns the reason behind her abduction as she meets the sickly Jigsaw (if you recall he was extremely ill in the previous film), along with his attractive assistant, the reason being to keep Jigsaw alive, with the cost of failure being her own life.  Seems Jiggy's got a game going, one he wants to be around for to see all the way through.  After this we meet the primary player in Jigsaw's most current game, a pathetic sack named Jeff (Macfadyen), as he's put through a series of tests, all of which involve other individuals suffering greatly, with Jeff having the ability to save them (for the whys and what nots you'll have to watch the film).  As Jeff progresses through Jigsaw's diabolical maze of gory madness, Lynn finds herself having to perform a little brain salad surgery, all while Jigsaw's assistant, who's a few clowns short of a circus, descends deeper into her own, personal pit of psychosis.  After a ton of flashbacks and some pretty horrific deaths, things eventually come full circle resulting in some memorable revelations.<br /><br />While I thought this third entry into the series entertaining, I think it is important to mention the importance of seeing the previous films prior to watching this one as there's a lot of references tied to what occurred previous i.e. this is not a stand alone sequel, as may be the case with other franchise features.  Now you could watch this film and follow along somewhat without having seen the previous entries, but you'll appreciate the complexities of the overall story all the more having all the pieces of the puzzle.  I did enjoy the concerted efforts to directly relate this to the previous films, but I thought the flashbacks to be excessive at times, especially the ones that filled in gaps that weren't necessarily vital in the overall scheme of things (Was anyone particularly enlightened by learning Jigsaw had help in setting up Dr. Gordon in the first film?).  Another aspect I didn't care for occurs near the end, after an important revelation...once revealed the filmmakers go through an extensive series short flashbacks perhaps to reinforce the impact, but it seemed more an effort to spoon feed the audience the all the bits that led up to said revelation, as if we weren't all that bright to get it in the first place.  I was paying attention so the events tied to the revelation weren't lost on me, and I felt it unnecessary to rehash the material.  Another bit that annoyed me slightly was the lighting in Jigsaw's lair...I thought it odd how many lighting fixtures worked on a sporadic basis, flashing on and off.  I know this was done to help create an atmosphere, but it became a little irritating after awhile.  The traps featured here were pretty wild (and vicious), and the gore factor high.  There are some real nasty devices throughout, the worst, in my opinion, being the rack, which Jigsaw claimed his personal favorite (the shotgun shell collar was a trip, as was the hideous hog-o-matic processor).  I won't reveal any more about it, but know it provides for a whole lot of intense, lingering pain before delivering death.  There are a few twists near the end, one of which, involving Lynn, I thought particularly well done, especially given the fact Jigsaw provided a good deal of clues prior to the revelation.  These clues seem innocuous statements initially, but once fully understood, they provide a respectable punch to the gut.  The performances were suitable, the story thoughtful and generally well crafted (there are a few holes and elements that require a good deal of suspension of disbelief), the atmosphere suitably grimy and ookie, and the pacing reasonable.  The story was complicated, but I thought Bousman, along with his editor, did a good job in keeping things orderly, ultimately paving the way for another sequel.<br /><br />This unrated DVD version (which runs 113 minutes compared to the 107 minute theatrical runtime), released by Lions Gate, features a sharp looking, widescreen anamorphic (1.78:1) picture, along with a vibrant audio track, available in both 5.1 and 2.0 Dolby Digital for English and Spanish.  There's a healthy assortment of extras including three featurettes, the first titled The Traps of Saw III, another titled The Details of Death: The Props of Saw III, and a third called Darren's Diary: Anatomy of a Director.  Also included are three commentary tracks, one featuring director Darren Lynn Bousman, writer/executive producer Leigh Whannell, and producers Oren Koules and Mark Burg, a second featuring executive producers Peter Block and Jason Constantine, and a third with director Darren Lynn Bousman, editor Kevin Greutert, and director of photography David A. Armstrong.  On top of that are deleted scenes, subtitles in English and Spanish, a theatrical trailer, a theatrical teaser, and trailers for Crank (2006), Saw Special Edition DVD, Saw II Special Edition DVD, The Punisher Extended Cut DVD, The Invincible Iron Man (2007) animated feature, and Hostel II (2007).  If you really thrive on extras, this is a decent edition to get, but you might want to wait and see if Lion's Gate, a company that seems to specialize in double dipping, is going to eventually release a two DVD special edition of the film, as they did with the previous Saw movies.<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />By the way, am I the only who thinks Shawnee Smith looks a lot better with long hair?</p></body></html>

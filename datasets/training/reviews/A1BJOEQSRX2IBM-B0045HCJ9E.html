'North By Northwest' is more lighthearted and fun  than those films, less psychologically oriented and more glossy good old  fashioned entertainment. Hitchcock took the 'innocent man on the run'  dilemma he practically invented in 'The 39 Steps' and then further explored  in 'Saboteur, but perfected in this classic film. In one of the definitive  Cary Grant roles, Grant was in peak form and at his most charming. It's  hard to imagine anyone else as Roger Thornhill or any other person who can  melt women with just a look, only Grant can do that. Endlessly entertaining  and sprinkled with wit and intrigue, one of the classic screen  entertainments. This time Eva Marie Saint is the 'icy blonde' a look that  obviously appealed to Hitchcock and a lot of actresses are living proof of  that; Grace Kelly, Kim Novak, Madeleine Carroll, Janet Leigh, etc. There is  an incredibly sexy (and long) kissing sequence that could compare with the  one Grand and Ingrid Bergman had in Hitch's 'Notorious', while not as tense  or as unbearably sexy it's still as memorable. James Mason is excellent as  the villainous Phillip Vandamme and this is one rare occasion when his  voice does not seem distracting in fact it kind of fits appropriately.  Martin Landau is also equally memorable as Vandamme's thug, there are some  homosexual undercurrents to his character. Filled with many memorable  scenes like the assassination in the UN, Cary Grant trying to drive a car  while drunk and of course the now classic crop-dusting sequence that is  pure Hitchcock genius all the way. The cliffhanger ending on Mount Rushmore  is incredibly suspenseful and equally memorable. One of the most constantly  entertaining films of all time, Hitchcock at his peak and at his most  charming. Extras: Hitchcock's usual cameo; this time as the man who barely  misses the bus in the beginning credits. From a scale of 1-10 I give this  film a 10!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Charlize Theron is a Sci-fi World Ninja in MTV Style: Loses Steam As It Goes"></head><body><p>As you know, `Aeon Flux' has been either ignored or dismissed as nonsense by the critics, and its results on the US box-office are certainly not what the producers would have expected them to be. So here is a question: Is this so bad? If bad, how bad?<br /><br />I finally saw the film, and at first I thought these critics were wrong. The earlier chapters, in which heroine Aeon Flux appears as ninja-like deadly assassin, are full of rip-roaring sequences that are fun to see, and there are many good ideas in them such as the deadly turf. Though I have not seen the original MTV series, I thought Charlize Theron (and her black costumes, if not her hairstyle) brings life to the thin story that betrays its origin.<br /><br />But sadly `Aeon Flux' loses steam too soon, after she encounters the target Trevor (Marton Csokas) the leader of this futuristic, totalitarian society. Except for the secrets surrounding Trevor and Aeon, the film has little to tell, and that little is not very interesting. The film also has Aeon's sister Una (Amelia Warner), Aeon's partner Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo), but their characters have not much to do in the story. Even two veterans such as Frances McDormand and Pete Postlethwaite are buries in the CGI-created halo and the heavy make-up.<br /><br />But if only there are healthy amount of good actions, every flaw would be forgiven. Sorry, but Karyn Kusama, who directed acclaimed `Girlfight' five years ago, may not be the right choice after all, for she fails to keep the film's good pace in the second half, slackening it with dull and uninspired actions. The concluding part is very disappointing, nothing that you have seen in sci-fi better actions like `Equilibrium.'<br /><br />Now I checked out the informative site of Rotten Tomatoes, and found that as many as four critics cited the name of `Catwoman' in order to mercilessly ridicule `Aeon Flux.' The unkind comparison is understandable. These two films both contain talented (and safe to say beautiful) Oscar-winners; both have one strong woman in its central role; and both define the meaning of `stylish action' in a quite unique way. Add to them `Tomb Raider' if you like and what can you have? Three Oscar winners and three very good-looking posters.</p></body></html>

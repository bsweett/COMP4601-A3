Other than that short complaint, the movie was superb. After watching Tim Burton's the nightmare before christmas and Monkey bones, I had expected a rather lighthearted jaunt through the dark and musty woods of Tim Burton's imagination. What I recieved was a thrill ride down a very spooky trail of terror, Not to mention humor. Johnny Depp made a very good wuss. Hah.<br /><br />I'm not picking on him, he's cool its just he wasn't quite what I expected. Someone more along the lines of Jack Sparrow I suppose. Come to think of it, I guess he really was like Jack Sparrow......<br /><br />Anyhow, back to the film at hand. The movie starts off with a bang, ending with just as much energy and gore that threaded its way throughout the movie. Not for the weak stomached as Johnny Depp made quite clear as the movie advanced. It grew rather difficult to pick out where the diabolical left off and the realism began, Tim Burton made them so much of the same that one would almost believe we truly live in a world infested with enraged Hessian's and bleeding trees. That was nice touch. Hmmm.</p></body></html>

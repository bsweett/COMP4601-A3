Suspiria is a film that I have been holding back on for some time now. The first reason is that I believed it could not live up to the hype. The second is that I have been recently disappointed by some of Dario Argento's latest works. I picked up the guts to go and watch it and this movie was sheer hell for me from start to finish. I was behind the sofa for most of it, howling. I am a grown man and I screamed and screamed! Grown men are not supposed to do that now are they?<p>Suspiria looks stunning and is only second best in terms of look to Lucio Fulci's The Beyond which has much better camerawork - however the set design, color and use of lighting in Suspiria are world class achievements in cinematography and motion picture strategy. The premise is a simple one. Jessica Harper plays Suzy Bannion, an American ballerina who heads to Germany to attend dance school. When she gets there she witnesses another girl running away from the school and overhears her saying something in the process. These words are important and she remembers them later in the last moments of the film. The running girl ends up staying in her friend's house and both are murdered in what has to be the most visually brutal slaughter yet committed to celluloid. That sequence alone is worth the ticket here. Back in the school more murders take place and Bannion tries to figure out what is the mystery behind the school and the deaths that are occurring there. At its bible sized hole in the heart, Suspiria is a murder mystery and you are left guessing as to what is what and who is who. There are several very scary sequences in this film and Argento manages to pull off a stunt with a blind man and his guide dog that right comes out of the blue. This film was non-stop horror entertainment from start to finish with a whooping ending to boot. My God what a finish! That was a sheer nerve-wrecking experience. <p>The whole film is one big payoff. The music is dead-on, one hundred percent accurate for this type of movie (and you can be damn sure that there is only ONE movie of this type!). It plays itself out like some kind of kid's fairytale-come-nightmare. Suspiria almost seems like a Tim Burton movie that is instead in the hands of raving sadistic maniac who knows how to make you jump and soil your pants twenty times over. If you watch this film with other people you will hear plenty word's around you to the gist of - "My God, I've just had ANOTHER accident."<p>Suspiria is NOT a gore / splatter fest like most of the other works from Argento. Yes, Suspiria does have gore and plenty of blood, but this movie is damn near the scariest films I have ever witnessed and I have seen literally hundreds in this genre. <p>This is a perfect horror film to "susperience?!"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bumpy Transition From Stage to Screen"></head><body><p>Most playwrights should never direct their own work. John Patrick Shanley's 2008 adaptation of his Pulitzer Prize-winning "Doubt" cries for the guiding hand of filmmaker Sidney Lumet, a master at stage-to-screen translation. Though Shanley has assembled a memorable cast, he knows little about cinematic technique. "Doubt" lacks the overall dramatic impact of its Broadway counterpart - even the denouement falls flat. Fortunately, the actors are excellent. Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams make the film version worth watching, yet it is Viola Davis' heart-wrenching portrayal that stays in the memory. However, you must see "Doubt" on stage to fully appreciate its emotional power.</p></body></html>

The movie is slow; the pathetic excuse for a plot doesn't really develop until half way through the movie (and when it does, it's rediculious). The attempt make the characters all tortured and conflicted is just lame. Campy. Predictable. Boring. Cliche.

Pathetic.<br /><br />The only part of the movie that didn't COMPLETELY suck was Kevin Spacey.<br /><br />This is the worst Superman movie ever and one of the worst movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />So NOT recommended.<br /><br />P.S.

<meta name="summary" content="Why another DVD?"></head><body><p>Fox is ridiculous. They're doing this with three films I know of: The Day After Tomorrow, Man on Fire and I, Robot. The problem is, of course, that these films were all very, very recently released on DVD for the first time. If they were truly interested in the interests of the Consumer, they would have released the two-disc editions the first time around - not one or two months later.<br /><br />The second problem with all this is that the "new" special features really aren't worth an upgrade. I don't see anything new on "I, Robot" save a movie ticket to see "The Fantastic Four" and an extra documentary. (By the way, the European release had all of these extras already - except the movie ticket - because they were kind enough to release a one-disc rental copy and a two-disc special edition SIMULTANEOUSLY.)<br /><br />I'm not a huge contender of special edition re-releases. I've shelled out the cash for them before, and in many cases I love when films (such as the upcoming Casino, Stripes, etc.) are re-released with new special features that weren't available on the original DVDs. (Because most of the time they were released at the turn of the '90s when DVDs were fairly new and not known for their expansive features.)<br /><br />However, to release special edition DVDs of films that have just been released on DVD to begin with is a real crime in my opinion. I'll probably buy "Man on Fire" but I will not buy "I, Robot" or "The Day After Tomorrow" - or, for that matter, Focus Features' re-release of "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" (which only contains four extra features, all of which are supposedly very poor.)<br /><br />These companies need to wise up.<br /><br />As far as the film "I, Robot" goes - it's better than I thought it would be. A pretty good brainless action blockbuster, good fun, nothing more.<br /><br />Not worth spending over $40 on once you own both DVDs, though.</p></body></html>

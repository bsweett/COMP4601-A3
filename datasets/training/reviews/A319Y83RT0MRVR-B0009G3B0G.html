<meta name="summary" content="Time Travel + Romance + Adrien Brody = time well spent"></head><body><p>"The Jacket" is a movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN69C2">The Time Traveler's Wife</a> should've been - the former is a sexy, futuristic, mysterious, thriller (while the latter, of course, was a failed attempt to adapt a spectacular novel). Not surprisingly, "The Jacket" has a stellar cast, spear-headed by the very talented Adrien Brody who shines as a Gulf War veteran who is deemed violent and is sent to a mental institution where he experiences alternate reality and is able to see 15 years into the future. Keira Knightley does an interesting drunk/American accent and Daniel Craig proves that he can play crazy with the best of them.</p></body></html>

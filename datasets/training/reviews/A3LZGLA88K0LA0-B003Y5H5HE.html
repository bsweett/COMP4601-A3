HUGO is visually breathtaking, deservedly winning 5 Oscars for its technical wizardry.  Of course, Scorsese's direction is brilliant, from its sweeping opening sequence to its glorious finale celebrating the restoration of the silent films.  This restoration is a basic element of the film's focus on creativity, determination and pride.  The movie is hypnotic and features an excellent cast.  Asa Butterfield's Hugo is superb, a child actor with an uncanny maturity who provides the heart and soul of the film...one of the best youth performances in recent cinema.  Chloe Grace Moretz continues her impressive career as the engaging Isabelle.  Ben Kingsley gives one of his best performances since GANDHI as the bitter Georges.  Sasha Baron Cohen is surprisingly effective as the disapproving inspector.  Rounding out the cast in smaller roles are Jude Law, Richard Griffiths, Ray Winstone, Christopher Lee and Emily Mortimer.<br />HUGO is delightfully entertaining and a credit to a master director's diversity and vision.</p></body></html>

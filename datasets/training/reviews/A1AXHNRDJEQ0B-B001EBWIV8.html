<meta name="summary" content="Disapointing"></head><body><p>In many movies that have extensive special effects (mostly sci fi movies), anyone can question whether the SF are there to enhance the art of movie making, or whether the movie is there to showcase the art of SF. In George Liucas' &quot;Start Wars&quot; films, the latter is correct, while in Peter Jackson's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, the former is.<p>The original Matrix film also belonged to the former. I feel that many other viewers, like me, were expecting Matrix Reloaded to be more of the same. If so - we were all sorely disappointed. There are some new ideas and plot twists, and some cheesy philosophy about choices and understanding our motives for making them (therefore I give this movie 2 stars), but it is almost hidden behind too much SF and too many over elaborate fight scenes. Granted, this had also existed in the first Matrix. Why am I objecting now? Lets take the fight scenes, for instance. In the first movie, they came to demonstrate to ability to bend rules we thought were un - bendable. Making lots of copies of Agent Smith fight Neo seemed to have little point but the show the movie makers' ability to create this sort of scene.</p></body></html>

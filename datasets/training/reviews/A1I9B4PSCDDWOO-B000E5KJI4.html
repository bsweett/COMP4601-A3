<meta name="summary" content="Could have been better"></head><body><p>This movie based on Homer's Illid appears to be somewhat of a mismash. I think they took the book and stuck into a blender. What came out was a relatively basic war movie where computer armies fight it out and the script and the story were kept relatively simple. Of course, leave it to Hollywood to reduced a ten year siege into two months!!! Brad Pitts actually is the center of this movie, playing the ultimate warrior but he seem slightly miscast. I think much of the problem lies in the fact that there seem to be so little characterization in all characters, just your basic two-dimensional cardboard folks with only their base nature as a reference.<p>For the production values, I thought the city of Troy was superbly well done with computer graphics. The men of Troy was well costumed while the Greeks looked like they looted every Hollywood warehouses to get their outfits. Some looke like they were last used in the Passion of the Christ movie. I thought they did the Trojan Horse very well. It really did look like something made from scratch and that was very effective.<p>Diane Kruger plays Helen of Troy, the beauty that "launched a thousand ships" so to speak. There's a nice photo of her in the May issue of Premiere which suggest that she may be capable of launching a thousand ships after her.<p>Overall, entertaining but not very deep movie. I think the presence of Peter O'Toole helped somewhat but overall, it all about war and this have been done before and better in the Lord of the Ring movies for example.</p></body></html>

Damon is in top form and a stoic spook, his character is hard to like much less love, I really could not for the life of me figure out why Jolie stays with him for so long; he is a bad husband and an even worse father, it is heart wrenching to watch his young son beg for his father's attention and Damon all but ignore him.  Damon puts country above all else and its amazing how startlingly obtuse he is about his families needs.  The film is beautifully shot and though quite lengthy its does not lag.  I really liked Michael Gambon in this, he is not what he seems and his advice to Damon, though not heeded, was the most valuable intelligence Damon gets..get out while you still can.  Damon's character does several things in this movie, that seem so out of character for someone so measured and with very good survival skills, but i suppose it's to propel the narrative, but still it's perplexing.  Be sure to watch the deleted sceens, because, it includes a story line that should have been kept in the movie, De Niro should have cut some of himself out of this film and left some of the deleted sceens in.  There is a great sceen toward the end with Joe Peci, and Peci asked Damon, and im perapharsing, he says...we italians have family and church, the irish have the irish nationalism, the jews have tradition, and he asked Damon, what do you have..meaning the WASP establishment I suppose, and Damon says..I have the united states of america, you people are only visiting..it's shocking in its honestly perfectly illuminates how a person of his time and place would have thought..in a word..scary!</p></body></html>

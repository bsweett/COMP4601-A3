<meta name="summary" content="Ripley's believe it or die"></head><body><p>Ripley, The Alien, and an isolated prison planet full of tasty inmates. What else do you need? Weaver's first time out as Ripley had a lot more surprise in it, but this works well anyway. There's the initial tension of Ripley as the only woman among the inmates but, as one says, "I've taken a vow of chastity, and that includes women."<br /><br />There are lots of chases in this movie, through the tech/grunge corridors of the semi-abandoned facility. Some include the vertiginous alien's-eye view as he [she?] races across walls and ceilings. Right down to the end, there's always one more gotcha from The Alien. And yes, the corporate lords are still the manipulative slimeballs they always were - you might have a better chance with The Alien than with them.<br /><br />Despite the buzz haircut and sweaty tee-shirt, Weaver looks great. Ripley is all woman, but doesn't have to wear pink to prove it. She's also the baddest on the block, Alien and murderers notwithstanding. That makes it especially amusing to see Weaver's character in the spoof movie, Galaxy Quest, an almost perfect opposite. Hard to believe the same actress did both.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

I rented a bunch of videos and this was the only video that I wasn't disappointed in. The rest were junk and a waste of money, not worth a second watch.<br /><br />Not only does this movie combine excellent, flawless acting, but also directing, movie shooting, and all else. I have yet to think up of a flaw that this movie has created. Nothing important.<br /><br />The gore in this movie was great! It might seem nasty to some but it makes the movie more graphical and realistic, also shows that the directors really try to bring out the real picture when it comes to love and war.<br /><br />I'm sleepy but other than that, this movie was very good, a rare movie definately worth the 5 stars if not more.</p></body></html>

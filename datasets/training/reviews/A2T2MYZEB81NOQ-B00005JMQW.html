<meta name="summary" content="Better than ever! It's Spider-Man!"></head><body><p>SPIDER-MAN 2 IS THE BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN! It has a wholly good plot, acting more perfect than the first, and so many more cool things happen in it, too. Doctor Octopus, my second most favorite Spidey villain next to Green Goblin(who already had his turn, of course)is given a full-fledged treatment as the villain of this movie. Spidey is cooler than ever, and Harry is being the big jerk he's meant to be. Aunt May gets a couple of licks in herself, and Mary Jane is even more beautiful. On top of all of that, this 10/10 film also has so many unexpected things happening in it! I have most certainly said enough. See it, for God's sake! SEE IT!</p></body></html>

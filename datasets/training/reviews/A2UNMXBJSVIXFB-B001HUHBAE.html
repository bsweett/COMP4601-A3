<meta name="summary" content="Zodiac (Director's Cut) (Blu-ray)"></head><body><p>Movie - 5.0 / 5.0<br /><br />I've always found the mystery genre to be pretty engrossing, especially when it has either a perplexing case to solve, a long or epic narrative, empathetic or interesting characters, or a combination of these. I tend to get my fill of said sleuthing and drama these days from the likes of House M.D., The Mentalist, Castle, and Lie to Me, which are fine and dandy considering they're just TV shows and are thus somewhat limited by their episodic nature and production budgets. Suffice it to say, though, David Fincher really captivated me with his work in Se7en and its unrelenting visceral assault on the senses. Its shock value, grittiness, and downright dark atmosphere were such an eye-opener to the genre (for me, anyway) that it remains one of my all-time favorite films and amongst the top in its class. And then he made Zodiac. While I love Se7en for all that it is stylistically, I dare even say Zodiac barely surpasses it in three ways: 1) the fact that it's a period piece and thus, has more realism (not to mention a lot of this actually happened at some point), 2) is over half an hour longer, which doesn't necessarily add to the characters, but boy does it accentuate the plot, and 3) the sheer amount of obsession as portrayed by the characters of Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), and to a lesser extent, Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.). That being said, Se7en and Zodiac are both crafty masterpieces in their own rights. But much like how Se7en infused the genre from a more emotional approach with its shock and grotesqueness, Zodiac seems to drive itself with much more technicality using facts, evidence, and frankly, a drier style of investigation to present itself. Not to discredit Se7en for being any less sleuthy, but I believe Zodiac to be slightly more enjoyable for its methodical nature, down-to-earth character portrayals, and massively engaging screenplay.  It's all about subtlety and attention to detail, much like the aforementioned TV shows listed above, and I was especially delighted to see such a depiction over what seems to, historically, be a very interesting case. Everything from the production, cinematography, score, script, and even sound design have a very low-key feel to them, yet in the end add a real sense of fascination and awe to the entire ordeal and the events that took place over the span of the investigation. And while the case never was solved, Fincher made a very entertaining depiction of it.<br /><br />Video - 5.0 / 5.0<br /><br />- Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />- Video resolution: 1080p<br />- Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br />- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />Zodiac was shot using the Thomson VIPER FilmStream Camera (a digital camera for those who care) and digitally mastered at 2K resolution. The result is a stunning and gorgeous transfer to Blu-ray. Black levels are the best part of the overall presentation with an amazing amount of definition, even amidst a lot of the darkly-lit venues and nighttime shots with all the little lines in clothing, shading, and texturing easily viewable. The smoke of cigarettes is especially pronounced whenever people were smoking them in a scene. Any shot of Paul Avery smoking up a storm, while subtle like the entire movie itself, looks great. Contrast handles perfectly with every bit of stubble visible on the closeup shots of Graysmith's face. Flesh tones, facial features, you name it; not a single visual element on any person or thing is lost or distorted throughout the entire duration of the film. I shutter to even think about how smudgy/blurry this would look on DVD. As for the colors, they're as natural as you can expect. From the various costuming of the era (late '60s through the '70s), I have to applaud cinematographer Harris Savides, production designer Donald Graham Burt, and art director Keith P. Cunningham for opting to go with a retro look on a contemporary camera. In most period pieces I've seen that take place in the '60s and '70s, rarely do I ever envision it looking as pristine as this. More often than not, titles like this usually end up looking somewhat washed up or a little desaturated through filters and such, which is thankfully not the case here at all. The clothes, their colors, and even the set looks as I'd imagine the '60s and '70s to "feel" like despite the actual picture being so sharp and gloriously rendered. My favorite scenes for reference are any of the office shots at The Chronicle for its ridiculously clean closeups, any part where people are smoking cigarettes (as much as I despise the act of smoking itself, it looks pretty damn striking in HD if you're any kind of videophile), or the scene where Graysmith goes down into Bob Vaughn's basement (only two 40W bulbs were used to light that entire room, which just goes to show how amazing the that Thomson VIPER camera is). This is reference video all the way.<br /><br />Audio - 4.5 / 5.0<br /><br />Languages<br />- English: Dolby TrueHD 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles<br />- English, English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />In response to all the other reviews I've read around the Internet about the audio being bad, I have to disagree with the low ratings. Yes, Zodiac is extremely dialogue-centric. It's a methodical, meat-and-potatoes, long-winding, and very technical investigation that relies more on plot progression, mood, and visual presentation for its atmospherics as opposed to the loud, bombastic, razzle dazzle mixes we've heard in other Fincher films. Ren Klyce's sound design is very subtle here with not a whole lot in terms of quantity, though he makes for it with quality. A good deal of the sound effects happen either in crowded areas (The Chronicle's offices) or in the more suspenseful moments (when Zodiac commits or is about to commit a murder). Dialogue, obviously, is not a problem. For all the talking there is, not a single line is lost, and even the phone calls sound very precise. The center channel does most of the work, while various background effects have great directionality and separation during the more busy sequences across the fronts. The opening credits is a good example of what I mean. The score by David Shire fits the period well, and the mood of the film even more so, and as we see the first letter from Zodiac make its way from the mail truck up the secretary, there's a very understated amount of depth and fidelity amongst all the doors, carts, typewriters, and telephones ringing all around the place. This is about as much as you'll hear from the rear speakers until the movie gets to other crowded scenes (people on the streets, visits at the police station, or any of the musical montages for the passing of time). Like I said, it's a sound design that's less about quantity and more about quality. For all the Fincher films I've heard Klyce mix that are on BD, I have to say the guy knows what he's doing. And if Fincher wanted to go a little quieter for this particular title, then so be it. It's no sonic powerhouse like Se7en or Fight Club beforehand, but for what it's worth and for what the film is, I'm fine with the way the movie is presented.  My favorite parts are the aforementioned opening credits (lots of busy bodies and noises, the scene where Zodiac attacks the couple by the lake (it's silently disturbing with no music, all the rustling grass, blowing wind, and stabbing and screaming at the end of it), and finally the part where Graysmith is in the basement with Bob Vaughn (for just really creepy atmospherics overall).<br /><br />Extras - 5.0 / 5.0<br /><br />Disc 1<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (Director David Fincher)<br />Fincher goes through many of the nuts and bolts about the making of the film. I especially like how he keeps everything in a sort of "present tense" mindset whenever he talks about a particular aspect of the movie and its filming. When said factoid or comment occurs, he talks about it vividly in great detail as if he were reliving the moment right there, only with the occasional anecdote to compliment it. I also like the fact that he doesn't get too anecdotal when talking about the actors on screen. Comments about them usually tend to be about casting, preparation for the role, and any of the quirks/experiences that occurred during the many, many, many takes he did with them on set. In addition, he talks about what it was like working with the real Robert Graysmith, Dave Toschi, and other people who were involved in the case and how the film portrayed them and the events that unfolded. I was also very surprised at all the parts Fincher pointed out that were either matte painting or blue screen backgrounds. They really fooled me the whole time into thinking that was just stellar production design. And finally, Fincher makes mention of the various parts they wrote took some dramatic licenses (which I feel worked pretty well).<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (Actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr.; Producer Brad Fischer, Screenwriter James Vanderbilt, and Author James Ellroy)<br />The two groups were recorded separately and dispersed into various locations of the film, but it's an entertaining listen, nonetheless. Most of the commentary comes from the executive side with Fischer and the two James' talking about a multitude of elements from the making of the movie, the interpretations and themes within the plot, how the actual events affected the lives of all the people and communities involved, and various anecdotes that range from jokey to insightful. The commentary from the actors. has more to do with recollections of filming, acting (as well as a few stories here and there), and there own interpretations of the characters and writing. There's a wealth of information to be heard on this track that compliments Fincher's commentary very well, so fans of the film should definitely give it a listen every now and again. I only wish the actors commentary would've included Mark Ruffalo as well, since he played such a huge part as Dave Toschi and provided such a fantastic performance in the process.<br /><br />Disc 2<br /><br />The special features are divided into 2 sections: The Film and The Facts (one for the movie and the other for the actual historical events).<br /><br />The Film<br /><br />- Zodiac Deciphered (HD; 54:15 altogether)<br />A pretty in-depth look at the making of Zodiac. It covers a wide range of of the technical work that went from the idea of the movie to the construction of all the sets, how they were shot, the actors and how they portrayed the characters, and even a little of the theme analysis at the end. You can play all the featurettes together or.. individually, but who'd want to do that? For those who are curious, though, here's the breakdown of the individual features:<br /><br />- Zodiac Deciphered (5:23)<br />Discusses the original rights lapse from Disney and how producer Brad Fischer was able to get it from the real Robert Graysmith himself. He and screenwriter James Vanderbilt had initially thought of Fincher from the get-go thinking he would actually turn it down. Obviously, it's a good thing he didn't.<br /><br />- Blue Rock Springs (8:09)<br />Talks mostly about the location scouting of Blue Rock Springs and how they chose a slightly different spot in the movie since the real location had changed over the years. Of interesting and morbid note is also the fact that they had the real Darlene Ferrin's clothes from evidence to make an exact replica of for the actress.<br /><br />- The San Francisco Chronicle (13:12)<br />Tells how they built the office from scratch and went to great lengths for the props. In addition to old telephones, they even went so far as to dig up the microfilm with the original newspaper publications from the real-life reports that were printed during the time of the actual killings. They also show a warehouse full of period clothing, and one funny little bit of Fincher doing 36 takes to get the right throw of a book on a car seat (that's dedication right there).<br /><br />- The Hall of Justice (6:27)<br />Looks mainly at the casting of Mark Ruffalo as Dave Toschi and Anthony Edwards as Bill Armstrong. They show pictures of their actual counterparts for comparison, and the resemblances are remarkable. At one point, they even had the real Dave Toschi on set giving out autographed boxes of animal crackers.<br /><br />- Presidio Heights (5:06)<br />Talks about the difficulty they had with shooting on location (as alluded to by Fincher's audio commentary on Disc 1 about a Homeowner's Association). To get around that problem, they built a set to double for shooting and used blue screens and CG to insert backgrounds, houses, and vehicles. Needless to say, they did an amazing job that certainly fooled me.<br /><br />- Lake Barryessa (7:27)<br />Starts off with the real Robert Graysmith talking about how impressed he was with Fincher's ability to realize they weren't even in the original spot when they initially got there for scouting. And when they finally did get the right spot, they actually had to plant their own shrubs and trees because so much of it had eroded over the course of time. In addition, there's an interesting anecdote involving Fincher and a 1-thread alteration to the Zodiac's mask.<br /><br />- Obsession (8:27)<br />Discusses some of the movie's themes and how the information they compiled for the plot was actually not available because the police wouldn't release it publicly. This feature also makes special mention of the fact that the point of the story is not establish the premise that Arthur Leigh Allen was the Zodiac, but that Graysmith and Toschi believed him to be, and that the real conclusion is anyone's guess since the case was never solved even to this day. Everything up to this point is either conjecture or just circumstance.<br /><br />- The Visual Effects of Zodiac (HD; 15:18)<br />This featurette covers the amount of stunning work that went into, what apparently, was the work of the visual effects gurus. Specifically, the gorgeous opening shot of San Fransisco in the opening credits was completely CG'd. Originally, they had taken still photos of the city using the Thomson VIPER with a longer lens and used those as reference for the correct lighting and structure detail. They also point out that Paul Stine's cab ride around San Fransisco, his bloddy murder, the Kathleen Johns, and the Transamerica Pyramid sequences were all either computer generated or composited as well. Again, great work by that team, I really couldn't tell the difference.<br /><br />- Pre-Visualization<br />Blue Rock Springs (SD; 1:06)<br />Lake Barryessa (SD; 4:21)<br />San Fransisco (SD; 1:02)<br /><br />- Theatrical Trailer (HD; 2:32)<br /><br />The Facts<br /><br />- This Is The Zodiac Speaking (HD; 1:42:18 altogether)<br />A massive feature that gives a haunting recollection of the murders Zodiac took credit for in his letters. Each segment includes interviews from the police officers involved, various experts, and even the survivors of the attacks. Each piece also includes case photos from the crime scene investigations, evidence from those who passed (such as Darlene Ferrin and Paul Stine's clothes), and even vintage footage from the actual TV reports. The present-day interviews with the people were a lot more intense than I thought they'd be, especially when they go into detail about the actual attacks themselves. It's sort of an unreal and horrifying story to listen to when you've actually seen the movie and then listen to the words straight from the person that nearly died those nights. For all the emotions a movie can induce from its script, screenplay, and cinematography, I'd be hard-pressed not to say that this entire feature isn't scarier than the movie itself. Definitely give this a watch if you're like me and don't know much about the case in general, but are intrigued, regardless. Here's a breakdown of the segments individually:<br /><br />- Lake Herman Road (13:15)<br />- Blue Rock Springs (22:44)<br />- Lake Barryessa (37:33)<br />- San Fransisco (28:45)<br /><br />- Prime Suspect: His Name Was Arthur Leigh Allen (HD; 42:35)<br />Since the book was written by Graysmith and thus adapted with the source material in which he compiled for us to believe that Zodiac was Allen, much of this feature focuses on said assumption using interviews with the officers, experts, and people involved with the investigation. It's a fascinating discussion about all the facts they did find and includes personal accounts from Bob Cheney (the man that knew Allen right before the killings started) as well as Ralph Spinelli (who claims to have encountered Allen with some pretty striking allegations that made Allen seem even more suspect afterward). It's a very in-depth look at the man a lot of people believed to be the culprit and should definitely be watched at least once for any fan of the film or case.<br /><br />Overall - 5.0 / 5.0<br /><br />I first saw this movie in '09 when I was lucky enough to find the Blu-ray on sale for $13 somewhere and don't regret the blind-buy one bit. I've become a big fan of David Fincher within the last 5-ish years and really appreciate his directing prowess and attention to detail. I'm too young to actually have lived through the happenings of these events, but the occasional crime case (whether it be real or fictional) is a cool way to keep my mind sharp, and I find it spectacular when someone can actually adapt these real-world crimes into some kind of television or cinematic gem that transcends beyond itself into something even more (in this case, something of a retrospective phenomenon). The acting, production value, and writing are all stupendous in this film. It's engrossingly epic and obsessively entertaining. The video quality is immaculate in HD, and while the audio presentation is subtle and nuanced (much like the film and its writing elements), it's as accurate a representation as you could ask for when given the moments on screen. Best of all, though, are a couple of excellent commentaries and an exhausting amount of supplements covering both the filming and real-life facts behind the entire Zodiac arc. This should be a must-own for fans of Fincher, and especially those who enjoy murder-mysteries.</p></body></html>

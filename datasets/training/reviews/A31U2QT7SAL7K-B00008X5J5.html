<meta name="summary" content="Eleanor Audley's Voice Makes This Film Work"></head><body><p>The Disney heroes/heroines never really did it for me. Maybe, its my slightly warped personality that makes me root for the villains. "Sleeping Beauty" boasts a humdinger of a bad girl in the guise of Malificent, maliciously voiced by the late character actress Eleanor Audley. She had the perfect pipes for the portrayal of one devoid of compassion and love.<p>The actress had previously made a distinctive contribution to an earlier Disney film, the classic "Cinderella" (she was the wicked stepmother). '60's audiences also remember her as Eddie Albert's mother on the comedy classic "Green Acres" and her frequent appearances on that other country-themed comedy "The Beverly Hillbillies".<p>Also, being a dragon fan, I love Malificent's final transformation as she takes on the valiant, handsome, and dashing (although, bland) prince.<p>Unfortunately, the good guy wins.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="SCINTILLATING POLITICAL LIVEWIRE"></head><body><p>It's hard to figure the film audiences of today. That this slick political thriller would go pear shaped at the box office seems more than a little unfair, considering that far less accomplished films have cut better figures.<br /><br />Sure, the setting may seem a little musty with all the big tykes from the FBI, the Secret Service, Special Ops and the CIA making an appearance in a criss-cross of motives (kidnap of the President's daughter). But there are still con-tricks and plot twists aplenty, all punctuated by Mamet's signature dialogue, which is as clipped as the mannerisms of the actors. The plot twists are not the usual cerebral kind that we have come to expect from him. They're more action oriented.<br /><br />Spartan almost plays in real-time, with us, the audience unraveling the meandering plot along with the characters in the film. It whisks us in a dizzy rush of events. We are not given time to think, we are not supposed to think; this is not a reflective film. There is nothing beneath the surface, nothing new. Stop and think, and all sorts of huge implausibilities immediately become apparent.<br /><br />But to its credit it chugs along with commendable pace and purpose. If I were to be particularly fastidious, I'd say that in the last half an hour Mamet appears to have given in to pandering his audience with what they want in a spy thriller: excitement and melodrama.<br /><br />Fortunately, Spartan stays clear of the scatter-shot editing and wall-to-wall pounding musical scores that plague most modern action thrillers. Val Kilmer is more than adequate as the effaced warrior. Baby-face Kristen Bell's guest appearance hangs in one's memory.<br /><br />It's a well-crafted and satisfying film, undeserving of its low rating, and certainly a very worthy rental at the very least.</p></body></html>

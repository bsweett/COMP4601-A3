<meta name="summary" content="Horrible events-focus on 2 characters distills the anxiety for viewer"></head><body><p>I had a dentist appointment in Toms River, NJ on 9/11/2001. I watched, like many, in horror, at the events unfolding in NYC, and was completely devastated. Like many, I know exactly where I was, what my mom said to me, when she put on the news, and I saw the planes hit the towers on CNN. It was impossible, and ubelievable at the time.<br /><br />Since then, I've made it a point to become more involved in world events to understand all of the "behind the scenes" structure, and international events/politics, not just those on American soil to gain perspective on how horrible things like this can happen here and around the world.<br /><br />Although I can't imagine the pain that families who didn't know if their sons, daughters, lovers, sisters, friends and others, had perished, I have felt loss. This film captures at least some of this horrendous anxiety that was felt in the US, and specifically for everyone directly affected. I just watched this film, today,  9 years after the events (I previously also saw United 93).<br /><br />Sgtrictly from a cinematic standpoint, and as an avid hi-def collector, The PQ and sound on the HD DVD are spectacular and it's the special features that really make this story even more real. As an East Coast resident, it was too soon for me, to watch this in theaters. As an avid NYC visitor, I have friends who work or have friends/relatives in the area, and when I saw the movie today, for the 1st time, the movie captured the mayhem that they described.<br /><br />I actually think it was a good thing that only a handful of characters were chosen to attempt to tell an uplifting story and provide some focus. I've seen several WTC documentaries, to try to get my mind around this horrible event. Triumphs were rare that day, and unfortunately most of the 4000 total people who died, and their families were not able to celebrate any.<br /><br />This film was supposed to be an exception, a film about the sparse hope and miracles that existed that day. I don't believe you can make a 2 hour film with 40 characters. There were probably many different viewpoints and experiences amidst that chaos and no one can sum all of them up in 2 hours, not even a major director; it may even dilute the film, and create an overwhelming "split screen" type atmosphere. I felt emotionally invested in the characters, because there was focus.<br /><br />The method of involving a few families,created at least some frame work and representation of the events. And as is the case with all films about real wars, or other current events, the viewpoints, especially amidst chaos, will be as different as the stars in the universe. This was a very touching film, and I highly recommend that you take the time (and emotional energy) to watch it, and the extras, they are worth it. May we, and other people around the world, who have previously lived under the every day anxiety of death caused by terrorism, never have to experience another event life this again.</p></body></html>

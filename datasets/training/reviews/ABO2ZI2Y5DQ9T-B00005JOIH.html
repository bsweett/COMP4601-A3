<meta name="summary" content="Yes, Superb as Thriller (with Perfect Opening), But the Plot Devices Are Very Questionable"></head><body><p>`Munich' starts with a gripping and hauntingly realistic opening sequence about the terrorists attack. The atmospheric film has also some effective moments as thriller, that easily testifies to the fact that Spielberg is one of the greatest storytellers in the world, if not the greatest film director. Still, `Munich' is a failure as thought-provoking drama that it clearly attempts to be.<br /><br />Ethically questionable, but Hollywood (or any other filmmakers) are certainly entitled to making a thriller out of the real-life tragedy, this case about the shocking deaths of the Israeli athletes. However, you cannot make a film which claims `inspired by the real events' with a clich&eacute;d plot device like a mysterious French guy `Louis' who sells information like in a spy novel. The assassination team has virtually no trouble in finding out the targets, which is quite unlikely, and though each set-piece is well-constructed, the discerning eye would spot the hackneyed ideas here and there, which are all insult to the intelligence of the audience.<br /><br />Yes, I know. The film is based on George Jonas book "Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team." As I haven't read the book, I can make no comment on the original source, but judging from the film Spielberg directed, the clandestine team consists of familiar `types' of the characters -- Newly-appointed leader (Eric Bana), trigger happy young male (Daniel Craig), cool and determined veteran (Ciaran Hinds), slightly geeky bomb maker (Mathieu Kassovitz), etc. Luckily the superb acting from the supports (not the lead) such as Ciaran Hinds and Hanns Zischler saves the film's main characters from stereotypes.<br /><br />As to Eric Bana, though he is no doubt a very talented actor, he was disappointing. Eric Bana plays Avner the leader of the team, who has a pregnant wife at home. I would choose a single, unmarried male for doing such a very dangerous job like assassination, but Spielberg must have thought otherwise. Anyway, Bana's Avner is only a boring presence beside the more authentic and nuanced acting from Hines and Geoffrey Rush, and Avner's changing attitudes to the cause of the mission and his identity are barely credible but predictable.<br /><br />I know some people (who noticed the WTC in the film's New York scenes) argue that the subject matter of terrorism and revenge is very immediate to us. I agree. But still I firmly believe that it is hard for that immediacy to co-exist with the film's entertainment value as thriller which is considerable. Now I come back to the film's great opening and three flashbacks showing what happened to the victims, of which effects are just terrifying because we know the terrible accounts are true. However, for all the insistence to the realism of Spielberg, the following story about the counter-terrorism team lacks the authentic voice of them.</p></body></html>

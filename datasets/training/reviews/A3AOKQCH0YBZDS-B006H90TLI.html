<meta name="summary" content="Interesting & Different, Contrasts In Dark Humor & Violence...."></head><body><p>Saw "No Country For Old Men" in the movie theaters when it 1st came out and thought it was riveting to watch from start to finish!<br /><br />This movie has a great cast of characters in it that make this movie interesting to watch along with the storyline itself. It is definitely a different take on a drug deal gone wrong & what may happen when an unlikely character stumbles across the aftermath & takes off with the loot after the drug deal has tragically gone way south.<br /><br />I liked the movie because it was interesting and different than other movies in the same genre. I also liked the contrasts between the violence and dark humor throughout this movie. The acting was superb on all counts by the entire cast members... However, my favorite performances were that of Javier Bardem, whom won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in his portrayal of the character, Anton Chigurh, whom I thought was the scariest bad guy I've ever seen in my life!! Tommy Lee Jones was also wonderful in his role of Sheriff Ed Tom Bell & I also enjoyed Kelly MacDonald's performance as Carla Jean Moss.<br /><br />******SPOILER SECTION, SO IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM DON'T READ WHAT I WRITE NEXT******<br /><br />The only thing I didn't enjoy was the ending of this movie.... I felt like it ended terribly!!!!! Did anyone else feel this way too????? What was up with the last 5 minutes where we see Tommy Lee Jones' character tell his wife about the dream/dreams he had the night before? Are we to take it that the entire film we just watched was a nightmare/bad dream Jones' character had the night before?</p></body></html>

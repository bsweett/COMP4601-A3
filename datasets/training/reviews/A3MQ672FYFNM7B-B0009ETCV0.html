And, actually, the fact of the matter is "Hostage" is very similar to at least half a dozen other movies that Bruce made. But nevertheless, it's an excellent movie. I enjoyed it because it was so fast-moving and even though I sort of had a feeling what was going to happen I still felt very shocked and surprised. I don't want to give too much away, but there were some great effects. As always, Bruce was exceptional. After watching this movie, I really think the man must have been a cop in a prior life because he had this role down pat. And the movie is not so much a story of just a hostage situation as it is more of a story of good verses evil. The movie really pushes the envelope while asking the viewers to examine the situation and question the entire realm of what evil truly is. I enjoyed this movie tremendously and cannot recommend it enough.</p></body></html>

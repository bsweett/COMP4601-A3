<meta name="summary" content="An Action Classic"></head><body><p>'Die Hard' is a must see show for anyone who loves action movies.<br /><br />Bruce Willis stars as New York police Officer John McClane.  He and his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) are separated.  She has taken a job transfer to Los Angeles.  John travels to the West Coast to visit her and the kids for the holidays.<br /><br />The trip starts off with an appearance at her company Christmas party.  This international firm is targeted by European terrorists who seize the office during the party.  Officer McClane is not present in the room when the seizure occurs.  When he hears what is going on, he starts targeting the bad guys.<br /><br />This is full of excitement from start to finish.  Willis does a great job as the hero.  Reginald Veljohnson is another great character as LA Police Sgt. Al Powell.  Although Powell is not central to the heroics, he is a good addition to the plot helping to inject a little humor and human touch into the show.<br /><br />This is really a superb show.  If you have not seen it, you are long overdue.</p></body></html>

Is it a classic? Yes although it's far from the most perfect Spielberg film. Clearly Spielberg has taken a page out of the Lucas playbook--when in doubt fix what really doesn't need fixing.<p>First the positives--the new opticals look terrific and the new sequences with E.T. do give him more mobility. The 20th anniversary edition includes all the new sequences. The new sequences are cute but don't really add a lot to the original film. <p>The &quot;original&quot; unretouched version of the film is included on disc two. Despite it's flaws, it's superior to the 20th anniversary re-release. Like Star Wars, what was added didn't amount to much and didn't improve the film. That's evident when you compare the two back to back. <p>The extras are nice. A look into the evolution of E.T. from conception to execution and comments from Spielberg in an introduction. Sadly, no audio commentary was done for the film. In a way that's good--most film directors explain too much and take away some of the magic.<p>The packaging is flimsy and, while well designed, E.T. should have been issued in a clamshell case. Clamshell cases tend to handle wear and tear better than cardboard packaging.</p></body></html>

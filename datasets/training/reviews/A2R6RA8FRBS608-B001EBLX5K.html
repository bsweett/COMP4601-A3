His government allegedly hopes to "benefit" from learning American ways. Of course, all this is merely a premise for a wacky comedy. We see Borat, played by Sacha Baron Cohen, traveling around the United States with his producer Azamat, making fun of them and sometimes driving them crazy with his Borat personality. The people he interviews, including a humor coach, feminists, a rodeo crowd and college students never knew that he was pulling their legs while they were making this film.<br /><br />It's stunning at times how much the Americans, including the humor coach and the people at a society dinner, put up with the rather crude and obnoxious Borat. Borat has many ways of making people less than comfortable and catch them off their guard. For example, he actually walks up to men on the New York City subway and tries to kiss them on the cheek! Ay! Of course, some people paid a high price for being "subjects" of the Borat experience; we are all familiar by now of the lawsuits that people filed against Sacha Cohen because they were humiliated by him on camera. They never knew they'd be seen across the world on movie screens. That could be embarrassing!<br /><br />Look also for a strong subplot: Borat sees Pamela Anderson on television and decides to run across the country, "interviewing" people, as he travels not just to understand Americans but also to trap Pamela Anderson into marrying him. Watch how this plays out when Borat eventually does meet Pamela!<br /><br />This movie is not for sensitive people who insist on political correctness. Borat Sagdiyev is certainly very much a Jew hater (although in real life Sacha Cohen is very religious Jew); and Borat's views on women, romance, handicapped people and African American people aren't exactly politically correct. In fact, Borat's beliefs are mostly downright racist. The trick, to make the movie work as a comedy, is to take these bigoted views and expose them (and the Americans who become ensnared in Borat's "little schemes") in a way that is sure to get a laugh. In essence, Borat tries to be a modern day "Archie Bunker" who also makes fun of (and provokes) people by trying to kiss them on the cheek when they have never even seen him before.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a plethora of deleted scenes; and the music "infomercial" was also very well done. We also get footage of Borat speaking to crowds, being interviewed on Late Night with Conen O'Brien and more!<br /><br />The cinematography is great in the scenes with Borat and Pamela Anderson; and I liked the scenes back in Kazakhstan when Borat is preparing to go to America.<br /><br />If you can take a joke, you will enjoy Borat. It's not for everyone; it's far from being politically correct but it should be OK once in a while to make fun of ourselves. After all, if Sacha Cohen, a devout Jew, can play the Jew-hating Borat, we ought to be able to laugh at ourselves, too. I will give this movie four stars and not five because there are some awfully controversial moments in the film; but I do recommend you see this. You ought to have a good laugh!</p></body></html>

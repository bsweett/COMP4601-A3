<meta name="summary" content="They Don't Make Them Any Better"></head><body><p>This is one of the best action movies ever made.  Period.  The shootout on the streets of LA is unsurpassed for excitement and pure adrenaline rush.  Fantastic direction and effects, most especially sound (hope you have Dolby surround sound!).<p>A flawless cast is put through their paces by a director at the top of his game.  Michael Mann is becoming a world class director, and getting better with each outing.  He tells a BIG story here, with the dual star power of Pacino &amp; DeNiro, and he tells his story BIG!<p>Three dimensional characters, terse and telling dialogue, superb direction as noted with complimentary excellence in cinematography, sound, special effects, etc. and a great script that makes the 2-1/2 hours fly by.  This is the real deal.  As good as it gets.<p>Don't miss this one, and get the surround sound cranked up and duck as the bullets and glass tear up your living room.</p></body></html>

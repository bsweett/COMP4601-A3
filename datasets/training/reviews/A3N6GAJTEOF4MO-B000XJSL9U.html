John hasn't seen any action since him and his old partner Zeus took down the New York bomber Simon Gruber. Now seems like the right time to get back in action and kick some major terrorist booty, only this time he needs the help of a computer geek. Ex-government official turned cyber terrorist aims to get revenge on the government that refused to listen to him and bring them to their knees. He employs a group of hackers to build a program for him which will help him take down the entire US networks, including Utilities, Traffic & defence. Once the program is built, the terrorist and his small team have no need for these small time hackers so by turning their hard drives into bombs he goes about executing every one of them. Unfortunately for him one of the hackers is being brought in by John McClane for suspicion of breaking into the FBI networks. The bomb goes off with McClane and the hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) inside, they don't die but now John is in the action and from that minute you know the big guy is back. He fires off a quick one liner after the explosion which makes you tingle with excitement as you remember the good old' days. "I hope that didn't wake the neighbours."<br />After the gun toting battle McClane and Farrell get out of the apartment building and proceed to go on the run, but although McClane has the intention of just dropping off Farrell at the station he is now pulled into this world of cyber terror.<br /><br />Bruce Willis has always been perfect for this role, and although people had their doubts about whether he could pull off the McClane character 12 years after the last film, he surely put their doubts to rest.<br />When we first meet Justin Long as the Cyber Hacker (Matt Farrell) it seems from the very first scene that you know he's going to be perfect for the role. He gives off this aura that he's someone who's not familiar with the world outside of his apartment, and becomes completely on edge when he first meets McClane. The relationship between both McClane and Farrell starts off the way it was meant to be is that Farrell is the criminal being brought in by the cop. This relationship develops through each scene and you see quite a clich&eacute; image of the technically wise kid teaching the slow old man about computers. It's not a bad thing, as the chemistry between the two really works and develops into what can only be described as a father/son relationship. Between the two characters a subtle side plot begins to develop as it gives us a clash of cultures story. Farrell teaches McClane about the world of computers and how they play a major part in the lives of everyone, and McClane teaches Farrell of the importance of putting his life on the line for his country and his family.<br />Justin Long and Timothy Olyphant are two very small time actors but acting alongside Willis in this film series can really put their names up in lights and build their careers. The character of Thomas Gabriel is a man who loved his country and after 9/11 he tried to warn the government how vulnerable their defence networks were. The government dismissed the claims and this effectively destroyed his career. He became angry and vengeful and decided to instil upon the U.S. government what's known as a fire sail which is a 3 stage program that can destroy the United States networks.<br /><br />The action is very much non-stop and quite reminiscent; more of the 3rd Die Hard movie rather than the first two. It's over the top and it's very much on a larger scale when compared to the other films in the series. An example of this is the scene in the tunnel when Gabriel directs all traffic towards McClane and Farrell under the tunnel. The number of cars that are smashed up and flung towards the two in an over the top fashion is insane. The CGI although used quite minimally is used in an intelligent manner and only used for when a live action sequence is simply impossible. Dare I say that this film brinks of the level of possibly being better than the first Die Hard film. The action is superb, the acting and chemistry amongst the actors is something special and something that a fan of cinema can truly appreciate.<br />Although this was a film based entirely on fiction, one has to wonder about the true possibilities of such events that took place in this film. Our governments will have us reassured that our networks are secure and impenetrable, yet time and time again we hear stories of how teenagers hack into what we're told as the most secure systems in the world. The possibility of a fire sail which is talked about in the movie is something which is possible in reality and that is something which I think gives the bigger impact in our minds and makes this all the more believable.<br /><br />Willis brings us the nostalgia effect in this film as we remember the man who had what we could call at least a marginal head of hair and he brings back the enthusiasm that he has for his country no matter how bad the pay is.<br /><br />Justin Long brings us the typical image of how we see today's young adult.  He has this disrespectful immaturity, yet this childish vulnerability that we come to adore with this character as he demands the constant protection of McClane but builds his self confidence after he is faced with difficult situation after difficult situation.<br /><br />Timothy Olyphant I feel is the star of this show as he creates a believable character who is as patriotic as McClane yet wants revenge against a government that betrayed him. He gives off this disgruntled insecure individual who started off simply wanting to prove a point but dug himself into a hole he can't get out of.<br /><br />This is easily one of the best films I've seen in a long time and I'm glad it's a Die Hard sequel as I would hate to be giving it a 1 star and telling everyone how terrible I thought this film was. The action was full on and non-stop and this was mixed with believable characters and a storyline that matches with today's fears of terrorism.<br /><br />I truly loved this film and have loved the past films in the series and this is the reason why this has been my longest review to date.</p></body></html>

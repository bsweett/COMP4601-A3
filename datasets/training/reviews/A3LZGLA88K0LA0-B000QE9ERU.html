<meta name="summary" content="SWEET REVENGE"></head><body><p>This is a comic book movie, folks.  So if it plays like one, isn't that what was expected?  Thomas Jane (Stander, Dreamcatcher, Deep Blue Sea) stars as Frank Castle, a special FBI agent, whose involvement in a sting operation results in the death of the son of a nasty criminal named Howard Saint (played by the ever evil John Travolta).  Travolta's revenge is to have Castle killed, but dear Salome-like wife Livia (a torchy Laura Harring) wants Castle's whole family wiped out.  This is accomplished at a family reunion of Castle's family on Puerto Rico.  Dad Roy Scheider and Castle's whole family are brutally murdered; Castle himself is shot and left for dead.  Mistake # 1, and it's a big one.  Castle nurses himself back to health and sets out to even the score.  He hides out in a dumpy apartment building, where his good neighbors include Rebecca Stamjin-Stamos in one of her best performances and the delightful Ben Foster as Dave, a nose/eyebrow/mouth-studded wimp whose loyalty and friendship are to be commended.  The inclusion of this trio adds some warmth and humor to the otherwise dark proceedings.<br /><br />Jonathan Hensleigh directs like a junior John Woo; the film is violent, and there are some exceptionally good action scenes.  Kevin Nash as the Russian is awesome in his short battle with poor Frank.<br /><br />Thomas Jane has been accused of being lifeless and dull--I found him very good in the role.  If your whole family and life had been obliterated, how would YOU act?  While vigilante justice isn't to be condoned, IN A FILM LIKE THIS, you cheer for Jane to take care of the vile group.  Will Patton as the gay henchman, Samantha Mathis as Castle's doomed wife are also excellent.<br /><br />Critically bombed unjustly, I recommend this film for people who like action and seeing justice served.</p></body></html>

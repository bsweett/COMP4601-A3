Nope.<br /><br />"Saw" is a hack-job of a movie, cribbed from superior scripts like "Se7en" and "The Cube," where victims get lured into totally illogical situations in some psychopath's attempt at teaching them a lesson. But "Saw" completely lacks "The Cube's" fascist police state backdrop or "Se7en's" gruesome moral bent. Instead, two random men, (writer/director Leigh Whannel and Cary Elwes) are trapped in some music video concept of a warehouse bathroom with a dead man, gun and tape deck between them. And things go downhill from there.<br /><br />Cary Elwes' acting is so strident that he becomes funny by the final act, as he simply just doesn't have the chops to portray that madness he's succumbing to. Danny Glover - obviously slumming it - turns into a hysterical twit as time rolls on. Whannel is so cardboard that you need only to look at his other credentials to understand how he got his part. Dialogue is beyond corny. And that's just the actors.<br /><br />When you get to the script, the continuity is howlingly laughable. Men step from bathtubs and are dry. Items removed from water are also dry. Blood appears on victim's clothing and disappears. And in one of the most hysterically ridiculous gaffs in modern movies, a truck involved in the chase scene changes MODELS by the end of the chase!<br /><br />OK so I sat through the whole thing two times. But the movie's concept is relatively slick - enough to lure in scared patrons to two sequels and make Tobin Bell's Jigsaw one of the better movie villains in recent horror genres. (Incidentally, I feel "Saw 2" to be the best of the three films, and "Saw 3" a shade better than the original if only by benefit of better budget and better acting.) But if you take your horror/suspense movies seriously, you'll understand just how "Scary Movie 4" made hash out of "Saw" with barely an effort.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Now *this* is an action movie"></head><body><p>I am neither a big Mission Impossible movie fan, nor a Tom Cruise fan, particuarly with things that have happened during the last year.  However, I am a fan of Phillip Seymour Hoffman and, while I have never actually watched a J.J. Abrams TV show, from what I've read and heard he knows his stuff.  I went in to see this movie not knowing what to expect.  Gone were the Mexican Standoffs and white doves of John Woo fame.  Gone was the silliness of the first one, so mocked now.  Replacing this is a gritty, "reelistic" (for an action film), and incredibly paced and exciting film.<br /><br />The idea of a secret agent having a home life and trying to hide it has been the subject of many movies, often-times comedy-action movies (True Lies, Mr. And Mrs. Smith).  So, when talk of M:I 3 and its focus on Ethan's life were circulated, I shrugged my shoulders.  But, J.J. used this situation to bring life to the film and to create some of its more thrilling moments.  From the beginning that is actually an end to the tension-filled climax, M:I 3 succeeds in keeping you glued to the screen and on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Phillip Hoffman proves once again that he deserves to be in the forefront.  And what a terrific followup to Capote.  Here, as you can see from the excellent teaser trailer, he is insidious, evil and absolutely terrific.  Playing a character with no moral compass and no compassion for anyone, Hoffman breathes life into what basically is your one dimensional bad guy and makes him his own.  Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise, but you have to give it to the guy, he loves his stunt work.<br /><br />The supporting characters are all good, from Ving Rhames to Keri Russel to Billy Crudup and Lawrence Fishburne.  What I really enjoyed about this film was how J.J. focused on the team-aspect.  It wasn't The Tom Cruise show; each of his teammates worked together and they all got face time to do necessary actions.  It was cool to watch.<br /><br />I can't think of an action movie in recent memory where the pacing felt so on pitch and always moving.  And the plot is terrific in that action movie, hero-must-save-the-world-and-his-lover sort of way.  Granted, this isn't Shakespeare and the plot isn't exactly believable, but for an action movie, it is definitely top rate.  And, really, what else are you going to see these films for?  Action, explosions, pop-corn.  Mission: Impossible 3 delivers on this promise and more.<br /><br />A five star action movie and a terrific start to the blockbuster season.</p></body></html>

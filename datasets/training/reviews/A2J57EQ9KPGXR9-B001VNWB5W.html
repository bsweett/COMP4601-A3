Fortuneately, no missteps were made in bringing this epic graphic novel to life. This movie was made for people familiar with the novel, so read the novel first (I read the original 12-issue series) if you have'nt already. This is a great movie - alot of stuff is going on at multiple levels in this movie.<br /><br />Yes, its a movie about superheroes, but it asks the question "what if they were real people". The human condition is thoroughly examined here with style. One particular theme, in the book, which is in the movie and is very important, is the conflict between the two main characters: Dr. Manhattan and Ozymandias - the god who thought he was a man and the man who thought he was a god. Great stuff.<br /><br />Nothing was half-done in this movie. The cinematography, the acting and the attention to detail all make watching the Watchmen a wonderful movie experience.</p></body></html>

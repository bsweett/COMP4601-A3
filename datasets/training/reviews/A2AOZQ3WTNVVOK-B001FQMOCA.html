Is the movie going to be a classic, or a pale copy of a pale copy?  There are no worries about this movie; it is a wonderful overview of Johnny Cash's life that hits the highlights and the feeling of his career without bogging down in excessive details.<br /><br />The movie fast forwards through Johnny Cash's early years, stopping briefly at incidents that had a profound effect on Cash in his adult life.  While little attention is given to details, a viewer quickly gets the sense of how Cash's life was affected by poverty, his brother's tragic accident, and his years in the Air Force.<br /><br />The movie really begins to take off in 1955.  Johnny tries to be several things that he clearly was not.  A chance encounter with a recording studio soon had Johnny launched on the perpetual touring circuit that was required in that era to popularize music.  Unfortunately, the constant touring was a strain on Cash and the temptations of touring, particularly alcohol, drugs and beautiful women, caused Cash's marriage and career to suffer.<br /><br />Moving in and out of Cash's life was June Carter.  June was the opposite of Cash - stable and level-headed.  Fortunate for Cash, who realized early in his career that he loved June Carter, June was always there when he needed her.  This movie ends with an overview of the latter part of Cash's career and marriage to June Carter Cash, again providing impressions and snapshots rather than excessive detail.<br /><br />Johnny Cash was, as many people are, and incredibly complicated person.  It would have been impossible to present the complexities of his life in any detail in two hours.  Director James Mangold went for impressions and key incidents, and we walk away feeling that we understand the person of Johnny Cash.  Mangold leaves lots of room for others who wish to fill in the vast detail of Cash's life, but Mangold has provided the outline and all the detail necessary for the critical early part of Cash's career.<br /><br />In addition to hitting only the highlights, which keeps the movie moving along briskly, the choice of actors was outstanding.  Joaquin Phoenix proves that his acting talents are as good as or better than those of his peers.  Reese Witherspoon proves that her acting talents have been underutilized in light comedy as she makes the role of June Carter Cash all her own.  Even more incredible, both actors sang the music you hear in the movie.  Considering particularly that Cash had a very unique voice, Phoenix was very brave in attempting the songs, and his outstanding effort helps make his role multi-dimensional.<br /><br />To further lend support for the quality of this movie, it received 26 awards, including an Oscar, and was nominated for another 20 awards.<br /><br />Hollywood seems fixated on glitzy special effects movies with mega-million dollar budgets and plots that exist only to support the special effects.  "Walk the Line" is a rare movie that reminds us all that Hollywood can still make a great movie that will appeal to those of us that like to hear stories of average people that became winners.  "Walk the Line" is one of the best movies of 2005, and is likely to be one of the best movies of the first decade of the new millennium.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

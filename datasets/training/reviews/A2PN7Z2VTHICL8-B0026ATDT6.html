<meta name="summary" content="Japanese horror film falls short"></head><body><p>I'm sure there are many fans of the Japanese film art that will disagree with me, but this film made little sense.  It skipped from here to there with little connection between scenes.  It was hard to follow and dubbed poorly.  The only positive note to it was that the monster was done with some very decent FX, looking like a carp with legs or some kind of mudskipper gone wrong.<br /><br />The film starts with the dumping of some very old formaldehyde down the drain and into the river.  What happens from this is our large and unfriendly mutated carp monster.  One sunny day, the monster jumps out of the river and wreaks havoc on the people enjoying a day by the water.  Some he eats and some he takes back to his "den" for later consumption.  Among those taken to the den is a young girl whose family won't give up on her.  (although there is a hilarious mourning scene where they all thrash around on the floor in front of her picture tacked up among the dead from the grisly attack)<br /><br />There's also a virus associated with the monster, and the government starts to spray people and takes one member of the girl's family into isolation to attempt to figure out the virus, since he seems to have no effect from it.  Meanwhile, the creature roams the sewers, and renegade bands descend into the sewers in an attempt to catch it, including the little girls aunt with her bow and arrow (she's recently been in an archery contest where she froze up at the critical moment).<br /><br />Though the monster is good, the movie makes little sense and there's a lot of scenes that "stretch" out a little too long.  I watched the movie with six other people and none of us could quite figure out what was going on.  It's an entirely different mindset from American movies.  It's a movie that will have to be watched more than once to figure it all out, if you have the inclination to watch it again.  I don't.  I just didn't think it was good enough for a second viewing.  My advice is to rent, not buy, and if you are really into Japanese films you will most likely love this movie more than I did.</p></body></html>

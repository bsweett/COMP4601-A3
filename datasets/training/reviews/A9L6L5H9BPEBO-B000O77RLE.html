To us kids, the Germans were derisively called Krauts or Huns and the Japanese were Japs or Nips. It was a common frame of reference to look at your enemy as subhuman, as fanatical madmen that should be exterminated. Such thinking is essential to the fighting man who must kill and still be able to redeem his ego from the psychosis of guilt and nightmares.<br /><br />Director Clint Eastwood presents something very much absent from war movies past, the humanization of our former enemies. "Letters from Iwo Jima" brings the Japanese perspective of the lead-up to the invasion of that island and the invasion. It centers around three characters, Ken Watanabe portrays Tadamichi Kuribayashi, the commanding general of the island, Tsuyoshi Ihara plays a Japanese officer who was a gold medalist as an Olympic equestrian, and Kazunari Ninomiya who is Private Saigo, the most pathetic soldier and sympathetic character of all three, a young father-to-be who answers the knock on the door and is told "Congratulations, you have been selected for the army," in a similar manner as Americans received their draft summons with the telegram that began with "Greetings!" His wife is chastised for crying at the news, as she is told it is a great honor to be chosen to die for his country. In one of the more poignant scenes, he tells his child in the womb that he is the daddy and promises to return home and she the child grow up.<br /><br />The Japanese commander is an egalitarian leader who does not share the fanaticism of some of his officers. He doesn't believe in ritual suicide or senseless charges. His letters home, from Iwo Jima tell his story and we see flashbacks of his time in the United States where he learned the language and made bonds of friendship. His closest friend is the officer and medalist who shares the same view of war and what constitute honor.<br /><br />The plot is the deprivation that Japanese suffered leading up the invasion, the endless preparation that created 11 miles of tunnels on Mt. Suribachi with ever dwindling provisions and replenishment and reinforcement that would never arrive. Soldiers question their military and cultural traditions that challenge them to die, when all they want to do is live and return to their homes and loved ones. Their turmoil is constant and we see it from the general to the lowest private. It's the turmoil of duty vs. the will to live.<br /><br />The story ends with the a soldier burying the letters of his commander so they will not be found. The story begins with Japanese anthropologists unearthing the letters.<br /><br />The splendor of this movie is its simplicity. It shows a minimum of color to reflect the deprivations and despair of the defenders.  The music is also muted, never overpowering adding its subtle sounds to a powerful script and images. The acting is superb and thankfully, the Japanese sound Japanese.  Clint Eastwood proves once again that he is a director to be taken seriously as the viewer cannot help but feel empathy for those who were once our most brutal foe. Eastwood also brings a strong message that in the brutality of war, soldiers of any uniform do not fight for their country, or their flag, or emperor. They fight for their closest comrades, their families and themselves. They fight to stay alive and stay whole physically and emotionally. On the island of Iwo Jima, many on both sides would never find either.<br /><br />It is a forgotten honor to remember our veterans on Memorial Day, men and women who have given their lives or their souls for their society. This time I will also think about those I never would have included before, someone like General Kuribayashi, Olympic champion Baron Nishi, and Private Saigo.<br /><br />Watch this film, and maybe you will understand why.<br /><br />For veterans everywhere.</p></body></html>

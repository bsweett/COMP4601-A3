<meta name="summary" content="True to life military film which is why it's my favorite Kubrick film"></head><body><p>Full Metal Jacket is one of the best films , Stanley Kubrick ever made. The film has humor, gut wrenching war scenes and brilliant acting. Matthew Modine is great as Joker, but it's Vincet D'Onforio and R.Lee Emery as Pyle and the Drill Sgt. The chemistry between these two actors is of David and Goliath calbiar. The film makes you feel like you're in basic training with the troops and although the film is violent it's still an art form. **** out ****.</p></body></html>

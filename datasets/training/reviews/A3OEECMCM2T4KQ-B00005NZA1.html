<meta name="summary" content="Fulfilling one's destiny..."></head><body><p>There is a notion that all of us have a particular talent or power within us, which must be used, defining our place and purpose in life. This is the central theme in M. Night Shyamalan's original film, ~Unbreakable~.<p>Do you wake up in the morning feeling a touch of melancholia or sadness, because you're not really doing what you're supposed to be doing - are you fulfilling your destiny?<p>David Dunn (Bruce Willis) certainly feels this sadness. When he miraculously survives a devastating train accident, the sole survivor, an eccentric character enters his life, Elija Price (Samuel Jackson), and reveals Dunn's true destiny. If you haven't seen ~Unbreakable~ Dunn's true calling will surprise you.<p>This theme is similarly explored in Shyamalan's other films - 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Signs'. In 'The Sixth Sense' a little boy must overcome his fear to fulfill his destiny - helping the dead resolve their unresolved issues on earth. And in 'Signs', a man of the cloth loses his faith, only to find it again after a series of life changing circumstances. However, ~Unbreakable~ has to be the most original of the three.<p>Shyamalan's talent as a filmmaker is without question - he uses certain techniques to create a suspense-filled atmosphere in his films that causes, for me at any rate, a visceral response.<p>Everything about this film, screenplay, direction, editing and the performances are first rate. ~Unbreakable~ is a five star viewing experience.</p></body></html>

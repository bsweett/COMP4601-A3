<meta name="summary" content="A brilliant animated movie!"></head><body><p>In China, a lazy and fat yet lovable Panda named Po (Voiced by Jack Black) is a daydreamer who dreams of being a warrior and joining with the famed Furious Five. Of course it's all pipedreams for him as he works with his unsusual dad (Voiced by James Hong) who serves noodles, but one day as the great masters ChiFu (Voiced by Dustin Hoffman) and Oogway (Voiced by Randull Duk Kim) wants to choose who the Dragon Warrior is but when he accidently gets chosen by Oogway he is believed to be the chosen one to fight against an escaped criminal named TaiLung (Ian Mcshane) who's very powerful and strong. Shifu with the furious five known as Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Viper (Lucy Liu), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Crane (David Cross), and Mantis (Seth Rogen) seem to dislike Po as they don't think he's the true Dragon Warrior but according to Oogway they must train him from clumsy fat-oaf to savior to the village.<br /><br />Very entertaining, hilarious and heartwarming animated martial arts comedy from Dreamworks that is their greatest animated movie since "Shrek 1 & 2" or "Over The Hedge". This is the first time for Dreamworks not to use pop culture references or modern music (except at the end credits) but focuses on straight storytelling with good timed humor and great animation to go with it. I love how the CGI is realistic to go with some imaginative traditional animated dream sequences and ending credits that would remind viewers of "Ninja Scroll" and "Samurai Jack". Han Zimmer's music score is outstanding yet very Asian and the film also uses heart to go along with it including a nice hidden message about what a secret can be.<br /><br />This blu-Ray is mindblowingly awesome with it's brilliant picture and sound quality that will knock your socks off. The extras include two Blu-Ray exclusives like The Animator's Corner with interviews with storyboards and BD-Live fun features, Trivia Track, Featurettes, audio commentary, Kung-Fu Fighting Music Video, How to Use Chopsticks featurette, Food Network Exclusive: Alton Brown at Mr. Ping's Noodle House, Interviews with the cast, Save the Pandas foundation spot, Learn how to Draw Po featurette and a game. I recommended this movie to the whole family, adults and kids alike as this is crowd pleasing entertainment.</p></body></html>

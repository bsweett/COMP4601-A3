<meta name="summary" content="Why another release of this?"></head><body><p>There was really no need for another release, and I hope I'm not the only one who's getting sick of stupid re-releases of DVDs already out, with just one extra bit on them. It's not necessary. Apart from this, I've already seen a 15th anniversary edition of Pretty Woman, fabulous, unless you already own the 10th anniversary edition.<br /><br />Much as I love this film, if you already own the previous DVD, then there's no point buying this. If you haven't seen the film, or haven't bought the DVD already, maybe thinking about buying it for a member of your family, for Christmas, then sure, go for it.<br /><br />OK, there's a few more extras on this, than the previous release. On this one, you have: commentaries by director Robert Wise, Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Charmian Carr, choreographer Dee Dee Wood, and Johannes Von Trapp; introduction by Julie Andrews on both discs; separate chapter list for songs only with Play All feature; English, French, and Spanish sing-a-long subtitles; A Few of My Favorite Things: A retrospective documentary; Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer: A Reminiscence; Charmian Carr on location with The Sound of Music from Liesl to Gretl: A 40th Anniversary Reunion; When You Know the Notes to Sing: A Sing-Along Phenomenon; Biography: The Von Trapp Family--Harmony and Discord; Restoration comparison; storyboard gallery; behind-the-scenes stills; lobby cards and one-sheets; screen test: Mia Farrow; and Trailers and TV spots: Theatrical teaser, Theatrical trailer, 1st Anniversary trailer, Academy Award trailer, 1973 reissue trailer, testimonial trailer, TV trailer.<br /><br />On the old edition you have: Original 1965 documentary Salzburg Sight and Sound (14 minutes); making of documentary The Sound of Music: From Fact to Phenomenon with cast interviews, rare music outtakes, photos and more! (87 minutes); audio supplement by Ernest Lehman; audio Interviews with Julie Andrews and Robert Wise; DVD-ROM games and links to fan site; storyboards, sketches, production stills and theatrical trailers, radio and TV spots.<br /><br />OK, so there's more on the new release, but do you really want to pay for it, when you're probably not that interested in watching the extras? I wouldn't. And as for the singalong bit, with the words going across the bottom of the screen, if you've seen the film enough times, then you'll already know the words off by heart! Or is that just me!<br /><br />I suggest you only buy this if you haven't already got the DVD. If you have, there's really no point.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A great great Movie !"></head><body><p>This is a GREAT movie. The acting is fantastic. Nicholson is just amazing also with the other guys. You understand easily why the movie won 5 academy awards. It's funny to see Dany Devito with hair and Louise Fletcher, the nasty but so quiet nurse, is so gorgeous and unfortunately evil. You won't understand how much you will sympathize with all those nuts but It happens. Thanks Milos Forman !</p></body></html>

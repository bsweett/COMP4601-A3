<meta name="summary" content="A Christmas Classic"></head><body><p>Nine-year-old Ralphie wants nothing in life more than a Red Rider BB gun.  He plots and schemes but no matter where he turns, he is thwarted by the mantra that all adults seem destined to utter, "You'll shoot your eye out."  This is a simple story of one family at Christmas time and follows Ralphie as he goes to school, deals with his parents, and keeps fighting to get his BB gun.<br /><br />This movie was virtually invisible when it was originally released, but has since become a holiday classic.  All of us can relate to Ralphie's quest on some level, and many can probably empathize with the parents as well.  The cast was virtually perfect from top to bottom and Peter Billingsley's wide eyed innocence is particularly effective.  The other standout is Darren McGavin with a wonderful performance as the dad that is understated at some times and wildly exaggerated at others... but always striking the right note at just the right time.  The only sour note is kid brother Randy who simply whines and cries throughout the entire movie and adds nothing funny or interesting.<br /><br />A Christmas Story deserves to be enjoyed each year during the Christmas season.  It's a timeless story and captures a little slice of Americana in a unique and charming way.  It is shown regularly on TV, but is much more enjoyable when watched uninterrupted and unedited from the DVD.</p></body></html>

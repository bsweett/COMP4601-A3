<meta name="summary" content="THE SHINING - A Really Great Film!"></head><body><p>Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING is one of the films that I have not changed my opinion on over the years. In fact, like most Kubrick films, I find that it gets better with each screening. It was an unqualified five star film experience because of the master direction of Stanley Kubric.<br /><br />I didn't even know when invited to see this film by a friend that it was a Stanley Kubric movie and went to see it on a week night.  Needless to say I told my wife about it the moment I got home and asked her to see it that weekend.  Even though this film was not terribly true to the King novel we both felt that it was another wonderful Stanley Kubrick movie.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the performances of both Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall. Jack Nickolson said during an interview that he really wished that he could have been in another Stanley Kubrick film.  Shelly Duval stated during her interview that Kubrick was merciless, but did help to bring out her very best performance.<br /><br />I saw this film when originally released in Connecticut in 1980.  A few days later I overheard two ladies speaking about Jack Nickolson's performance in the mall and tuned in to hear what I thought would be great praise for both the actor and director of THE SHINING.  I was very surprised to hear that they thought Jack Nickolson should be ashamed of himself and that Kubrick had some nerve to release another such film in the United States (I assumed they were talking about CLOCKWORK). I guess they thought that Kubrick brought out the very worst in Jack.</p></body></html>

Don't get me wrong, I loved the original, but this was the best between the two. The acting is as strong as every and the story is even more compelling. Alan does a fantastic job in this film as Nightcrawler. The villain of the film is interesting and the story introduces the beginning story of the Phoenix. Overall a great film that lived up to the expectations left from the first film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Polly Perkins.  I've heard so much about you.  It's a pleasure to finally meet the competition.""></head><body><p>Kerry Conran's "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is a visually-stunning tribute to the science-fiction films of yesteryear.  Yet, when you get past the breathtaking production design, you find yourself watching a film that is just a smidge more sophisticated than those Commando Cody shorts that used to air on "Mystery Science Theater 3000."<br /><br />Joe "Sky Captain" Sullivan (Jude Law) is always there to save the day whenever danger threatens.  He is reunited with old flame Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) when giant robots invade Manhattan.  It turns out that the robots are part of a dastardly plan conceived by the mysterious Doctor Totenkopf (Laurence Olivier).  With the help of Franky Cook (Angelina Jolie), the captain of a British airship, Joe and Polly set out to defeat the villainous mastermind.<br /><br />If the story of "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" seems bare-boned, it is because it is bare-boned.  Conran apparently was not content with just recreating the look and feel of the science-fiction films of the past.  He also duplicates the pedestrian scripts and one-dimensional characters that characterized the more cheesy entries in the genre.  It is too bad that such a tepid screenplay undermines all the hard work done to give "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" its distinctive look.  Law, Paltrow, and Jolie do their best but they are trapped in a film that completely disregards substance in its pursuit of style.</p></body></html>

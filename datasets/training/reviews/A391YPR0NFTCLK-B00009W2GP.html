<meta name="summary" content=""The Matrix Revolutions""></head><body><p>"The Matrix" films were a lot of fun, and this triology will be remembered for a long time. Our kids will be watching these three movies! Each film has something differant about it that will make it cherished forever. The first movie in the series, "The Matrix", had a fantastic plot and origional comcepts with compelling drama and action! The second film, "The Matrix Reloaded", was in my opinion more fun than the first, even though you could not fully understand the plot with out seeing the third film, but the action was fantastic and plentiful. Now for the third film, "The Matrix Revolutions". Some people complain that this was a bad movie and I really hate it when thy do, because it is not! They did not like the battle, well hello what did you expect a negoations between humans and machines! There had to be a battle because they said it ever since the first movie! You can also tell by the title! Revolutions! The second and third films in this series were very missunderstood and I have no idea why, they fit like puzzle peices with the first! This is a great series and I recomend it to everyone!  <p>"The Matrix" is available now on DVD.<br />"The Matrix Reloaded" is available now on DVD.<br />"The Matrix Revolutions" is available APRIL 6TH on DVD<br />(And I love the cover art, someone said they thought is lazy, whatever!)</p></body></html>

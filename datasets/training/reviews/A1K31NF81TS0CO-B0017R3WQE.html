This movie goes down as one of my favorite movies of all time.  Not my most favorite, mind you, but definitely up there in the top 10!<br /><br />The first time I saw this movie, back in the mid 80's, I was just at the end of highschool, and had started college.  A couple buddies of mine and my brother went to see Scarface and find out what the fuss was all about!<br /><br />We walked out, awestricken!  What an incredibly emotionally charged experience watching Scarface for the first time.  Seeing Al Pacino on the big screen, playing something other than an Italian-American; bad guy Cuban Mafioso punk!  His curse laden slurring pronunciation of words has influenced many poor imitators including comedian Dana Carvy all the way to Tony Soprano!  The storyline has also branched off several imitators, from videogames to B-Rated Movies, hell, even A-Rated movies.  But nothing compares to the original!<br /><br />Do I need to tell you the story?  Probably not.  Maybe it's more fun to just shout out some great quotes and favorite parts of the film.<br /><br />Favorite Quotes:<br /><br />1) "Say hello to my little friend!"  My college-hood buddy always insisted the line was:  "I want you to meet my little friend!" but I always knew the truth.<br /><br />2) "I never f'ed nobody, didn't have it coming to him."<br /><br />3) "In this country, you gotta make the money first. Then when you get the money, you get the power. Then when you get the power, then you get the women."<br /><br />4) Tony Montana: Me, I want what's coming to me.<br />Manny: Oh, well... what's coming to you?<br />Tony Montana: The world, Chico, and everything in it.<br /><br />5) Dat chick he's with - she like me.<br /><br />6) You wanna waste my time? Okay. I call my lawyer. He's the best lawyer in Miami. He's such a good lawyer, that by tomorrow morning, you gonna be working in Alaska. So dress warm.<br /><br />I'm sure you all can think of many more, I'm sure.  All in all, this movie is excellent, and provides a lot of bang for you buck, in a gratuitioutous sort of way!<br /><br />My type of movie.  And on top of all this, directed by Brian De Palma, my favorite all time director.  Two W's up, way up!</p></body></html>

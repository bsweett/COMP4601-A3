<meta name="summary" content="Amazing Blu-Ray Transfer & Photography"></head><body><p>The cinematography is the high point in this emotional movie, with lots of pretty shots outside and inside. It's just stunning at times, and on this Blu-Ray release "incredible" is probably the best description of the transfer.  It's just amazing.  Kudos to cinematographer Caleb Deschanel for a job well done. It's also a terrific audio movie with a lot of surround sound that's impressive, especially when the cannons are shot.<br /><br />As for the story, this is All-American flag-waving which nauseates some but makes most the U.S. citizens happy. This is "Braveheart" all over again, except instead of Middle Ages Scotland and England, it's the United States and the American Revolution. Mel Gibson plays a similarly-heroic person he played in Braveheart but he's still fighting the British, time time as an American patriot "Benjamin Martin.".<br /><br />Even though it's considered an "epic," At 174 minutes it is a tad long, but I don't remember ever being bored.  Women beware: this gets a little bloody in parts. It's not as gory as Braveheart, but there is still a good deal of violence.<br />In all, a powerful story magnificently filmed.</p></body></html>

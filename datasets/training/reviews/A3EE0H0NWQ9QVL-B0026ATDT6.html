Stunning as monster movie adventure, the film is mostly a campy and satirical trek through a biological disaster of epic proportions.  Drawing from the recent SARS scare, the film reflects on the repercussions of the clampdown taken to eradicate the disease while keeping the victims under a martial law type quarantine.<br /><br />It all begins in a lab where a young subordinate is working with his older superior.  Noting the bottles of toxins are gathering dust, the elder orders the young man to empty the contents of the lethal substances down the drain.  While many of us would at least try to go over his head, we're not supposed to take it that far as the younger scientist objects to the procedural effects on the Han River.  The narrative then turns to a snack shop owner, Park Hee-bong (Byun Hee bong),  whose daughter, Nam-joo, is an archery champion and a son who is asleep at the counter during his absence.<br /><br />The events that transpire are a real awakening.  Down at the Han River, a mutant cocoon figure hangs by a bridge. People by the riverbank watch in horror as the mass comes to life.  Amphibious by nature (although most descriptions favor a scaly reptilian presence) the monster comes to shore and wreaks havoc throughout the land.  Panic ensues, and the monster either devours or captures its victims.  Tragically, it takes the snack bar owner's granddaughter to a sewer and keeps her captive in its lair.  The fast motion of film skillfully captures the victims in view of the monster as he hunts them down, but the silky smooth slow motion shots also resonate the key moments when the innocent are in peril.<br /><br />From here the narrative lightens up.  We have loopy scenes where those tainted by the monster have acquired a mysterious disease are treated like villains rather than victims.  Newsclips show how the South Korean and American governments clamp down on the affliction like a military conquest.  Becoming fugitives in exile, the family tries to escape quarantine and rescue the girl from the monster's clutches.<br /><br />Distinctive and unique, 'The Host' is thoroughly thought-provoking entertainment, even if it sometimes hits its satiric notes too long and too often.</p></body></html>

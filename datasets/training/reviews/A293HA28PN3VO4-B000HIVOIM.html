<meta name="summary" content="Sub Par Blu-Ray transfer-fun 80's action movie"></head><body><p>I wish Amazon would add sub scales for PQ, AQ, overall movie and other criteria, so that, with the advent of Blu-Ray, technical as well as cinematic aspects would be rated separately. What if you love a film, but hate the transfer?<br /><br />I had never seen all of Total Recall, and as a fan of older Sci-Fi and action films, I thought the effects were fun and advanced for the time period. Despite Arnold's mediocre acting skills, I am still a fan of his films, because they're so "over the top" and action packed. This film from the 90's was a cool "throwback" for me, and I enjoyed the sound and visual effects, as well as the story line of implanted memories, vicarious living etc. The storyline has often been mimicked by movies that followed in the next decade and for historical purposes and perspective this film is interesting as its themes remain relevant. Seeing Sharon Stone in action sequences was funny but effective, and it was cool to see her in some of her earlier work.<br /><br />The sound was powerful but the transfer was very dirty and there was significant noise and specs that littered the print. The colors were not as vibrant, as I had hoped, and having seen some much older films, that have been restored (Poltergeist, for instance), this older film's transfer is quite disappointing. Still the picture was clear and on a 50" Panasonic Plasma screen, sitting about 15-20 ft back, it still was a clean/clear experience. For the price of under $12, which I paid, it remains a fun and thought provoking sci-fi film for my collection. It is not demo material, but for its story worth a look for fans.</p></body></html>

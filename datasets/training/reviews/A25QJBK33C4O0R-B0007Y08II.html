<meta name="summary" content="This movie just cracks me up"></head><body><p>"He's getting away with the WMDs!"<br /><br />Oh this movie is far from politically correct (as with just about all of the Parker and Stone creations) but it is outrageously funny and entertaining.<br /><br />While I had been avoiding buying things in the UMD format initially, the release of the Slimline PSP with it's ability to output to TV via the add-on cable had me going back and buying some favorites for viewing on the PSP with the thought being that I could at least watch the same movies on the bigger screen if I desired.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that I'll get in just about every available format as I can't help but watch it when I catch it on the TV and then get irritated by how censored the movie is and how badly it's chopped up for insertion of commercials and such.  At that point I pull out the appropriate format disc and watch my own uncensored copy.<br /><br />This one is for you Kim Jong... ;-)</p></body></html>

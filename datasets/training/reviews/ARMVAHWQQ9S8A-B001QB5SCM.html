I'm not a fan of Cameron Diaz, and both the title and the trailer turned me off.  It was a small mercy that Toni Collette starred opposite of Diaz, but the film seemed to scream "stereotypical chick flick!" at the top of its lungs.  Well, turns out, it's not.  Instead of hopping from cliche to cliche, it bravely swerves around them, taking the audience on an unexpected and blissful ride.  The considerable running length that initially made me cringe became a blessing, because I just wanted more.<br /><br />Collette shines as expected, and Diaz admittedly impresses here.  Their nuanced performances, which punch up an already fantastic script, allow the viewer to really feel the characters, loving and hating them at the same time.  I'll avoid plot summary here, because this is a film that should take you by surprise, but the general idea behind the film is that Collette plays Rose, a sexually deprived woman, and Diaz plays Maggie, who uses sex to get what she wants.  The two clash throughout the film and... I'll stop there.  There are so many awesome plot elements that are thrown in that really make the movie a layered, enjoyable, filling experience that to describe further would be to deprive you of the many surprises the film offers.<br /><br />In short, watch the movie.  You'll be surprised, touched, and entertained.<br /><br />8/10</p></body></html>

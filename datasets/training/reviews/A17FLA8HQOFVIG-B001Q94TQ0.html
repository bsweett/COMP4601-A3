<meta name="summary" content="Cruel web of the drug world and one young woman's choice"></head><body><p>This 2004 Independent film has won all kinds of awards and I can well understand why.  It deals with a subject that I've been vaguely aware of and brings it up close and personal.  And it does it so well that I felt I was right inside the film, feeling the pressures of a young Columbian woman as she makes her choice to smuggle drugs into the United States.<br /><br />We first meet Maria in her native land, where she works all day picking roses and preparing them for export.  In spite of the beauty of the flowers, it is physical labor with an unfeeling boss who won't even let Maria go to the bathroom when she needs to.  Her family needs the few pesos she earns and are upset when she quits her job.  But she has another secret.  She's pregnant.  And her boyfriend is a real loser.  She refuses to marry him and leaves her small town to look for work in Bogot&aacute;.  Immediately she's recruited to be a "mule", swallowing rubber pellets filled with a white powder and then boarding a passenger plane to America.  The audience then gets to see exactly what this means.  Maria is told not to eat anything for 24 hours.  Then she is given some sort of anesthetic to keep her intestines quiet.  And then, with grueling realism, we watch as she gags and chokes and eventually swallows 63 of these pellets which look about 2 inches long and an inch or so wide.  We also meet her traveling companions, one of which is Lucy, who has made the trip on two different occasions and teaches Maria how to practice swallowing grapes so she learn to do the task.  There's also her best friend, Blanca, from the flower factory. The plane ride is a horror.  And when she goes to the bathroom and expels a pellet, she has to re-swallow it again.<br /><br />But that is not the end of the story.  Eventually Maria does make it through and is taken to a motel in New Jersey.  And her experience with the young men whose job it is to get the pellets after they are expelled is a nightmare.  He friend Lucy gets sick, very sick.<br /><br />Maria and Blanca eventually make their way to Jackson Heights in the Borough of Queens.  She has an address of Lucy's sister.  Life in America is hard for the sister who is married and pregnant, but she agrees to let Maria and Blanca stay with her.  Now Maria gets a little bit of a taste of America.  It is very strange to her.<br /><br />An unknown actress named Catalina Sandino Moreno plays the role of Maria.  She is fabulous.  And, I understand that in the Berlin Film Festival she tied with Charlize Theron (Monster) for best actress.  Everyone in the cast is wonderful though and so is the directing and cinematography.  There was tension in every scene and I felt I was right there with her, experiencing the drug world as this cast of characters does.  There are no guns or big money displayed in this film.  It's only about the little people who are caught in the drug world's web.  This is a fine film and the fact that I found myself retching as I watched it, only reinforces its realism.<br /><br />Highly recommended, but not for anyone with a weak stomach.</p></body></html>

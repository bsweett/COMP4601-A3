<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding Performance, Fair Film"></head><body><p>"The Iron Lady"  is the story of the political rise and fall of Margaret Thatcher (Meryl Streep) from her modest early years as a clerk in her parents' grocery shop to prime minister of Great Britain.  As with many screen biographies, the movie touches on career high points and, in the interest of maintaining a reasonable running time, either encapsulates or sidesteps the rest.<br /><br />The story unfolds from the present day as Thatcher recalls episodes from her past, with Alexandra Roach as the young Margaret, and her often tempestuous tenure as prime minister, the film's most interesting.  We see Thatcher's rise to prominence in Parliament even as she is ridiculed as both a woman and a newcomer who dares to challenge seasoned members of that body.  She seeks the advice of image shapers who suggest ways to command the respect of her peers and their serious attention.  These include a new hairdo, a deeper speaking voice, and the abandonment of hats.<br /><br />Traditional make-up, hair styling, prosthetics, and contact lenses contribute to an often uncanny likeness between star and real-life stateswoman.<br /><br />Streep's performance is extraordinary and won her her third Oscar.  However, the film itself is kind of old-fashioned in its depiction of Thatcher as stalwart world leader.  We see her triumphs and her modest beginnings, yet there is a sense that we've never really gotten insight into the woman.<br /><br />Blu-ray extras include a making-of documentary and featurettes on Thatcher's husband, Denis; the film's costume design; Thatcher's battle in the House of Commons; and transforming Streep into Margaret Thatcher.  The movie is also available on DVD.</p></body></html>

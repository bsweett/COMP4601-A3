I was almost embarrassed to hate this film because it's actually too much of a joke; a vanity piece NOT to be taken serious. My eyes rolled back every time Kim Basinger appeared on screen. What a sad choice she made taking this part, but as actresses age, well, you sometimes have to take what you can get - that's the cold, ugly truth. And what about Em's "co-stars". Did the director tell each of them: "Alright, now in every scene that you appear with B.Wabbitz you have to act a fool - that is, obsequious and fawning beyond all measure, because you know, he's M&M". I give it 2 stars for interesting cinematography and that's it.</p></body></html>

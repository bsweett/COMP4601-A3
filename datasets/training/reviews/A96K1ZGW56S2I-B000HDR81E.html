<meta name="summary" content="Comical, Yes. But It's Not a Comedy."></head><body><p>Marketed as a light hearted comedy about a couple who break up thenrefusing to leave the condo they have shared for the past several years, THE BREAK-UP is anything but light-hearted and is one of the worst "big" movies of the 2006 summer season.  The film stars Vince Vaughn as the biggest jerk in the film, Gary Grobowski and Jennifer Aniston as his lover, Brooke Meyers (ironically this film about spoiled relationships and refusals of reconciliation brought Vaughn and Aniston together as a couple).  After a dinner with both Brooke and Gary's families present, the two become involved in a heated argument.  Gary, being the stubborn, pig-headed male that he is, refuses to take the first step and apologize for his overdramatics. Thus, what begins as a simple failure to communicate turns into an extended "he said, she said" and "he did, she did" fight that escalates beyond the point of no return.<br /><br />There are a few funny moments in the movie, the film includes a strong cast with some fine acting, and it does a good job of displaying some of the differences between how men and women deal with difficulties.  Both Brooke and Gary desperately want reconciliation between each other, but neither is willing to bridge the gap and perform the work that needs to be done.  Instead, they each attempt to make the other become angrier and more upset than they already are.  Each attempt that Brooke makes to turn Gary jealous and upset fails.  Her attempts fail because each of her attempts are things that would upset a woman. Brooke mistakenly believes that Gary thinks the same way that she does. However, Gary is a man and instead of Brooke's attempts infuriating, they propel him to further compete in what he believes is nothing more than a game of one-upmanship.  On the other hand, Gary does know what can hurt Brooke and each one of his efforts severely hurt Brooke. That is Gary's mistake, he believes the whole thing to be one big game.<br /><br />THE BREAK-UP is a major let-down.  Watching the film is similar to watching two people purposely destroy their lives, knowing it's not what they want to do, but because of pride they refuse to stop.  It's extremely sad and despite the realistic moments, it is so depressing it becomes too unrealistic.  THE BREAK-UP, however, is the best movie I've seen in a long time to illustrate the importance of commitment in a romantic relationship.  Despite that, it's really not worth the time to watch.</p></body></html>

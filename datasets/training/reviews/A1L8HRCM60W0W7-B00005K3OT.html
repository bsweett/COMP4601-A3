But I guess I was rather pleased with Chocolat, the execution is fine. <p>Juliette Binoche sparkles as usual. Johnny Depp's Irish accent is passably credible. Their chemistry is good, specially in a scene where Juliette swims to protect her daughter. Problem is that once Depp has introduced a parallel to the notion of a stranger upsetting the conservative patterns of a village (which btw is merely to provide a romantic backdrop for Juliette), everything not only becomes preachy but also quite predictable.<p>A wide array of chocolate in all shapes and contours comes to the rescue though, adding a splendid flavor to the screen. But don't bother to ask how such a reclusive, middle-of-nowhere village gets all that cocoa. <p>The subdued religious angle is a bit moronic, it makes organized religion look like a kindergarten tiff. Just because Binoche's character is &quot;different&quot; no one takes easily to her and every kid in town feels comfortable taunting her child at school. What precise religion was this?<p>The final scene with a whole village prancing about at Easter together with vagabonds and gypsies is banal to the hilt. So is the priest's message of tolerance, however praiseworthy it may have been in itself. Come to think, we could probably have done without the gypsy stuff altogether. <p>Anyway, the film is woth seeing if you know what you're getting into and are expecting pseudo-charming fluff. In the same league perhaps as Notting Hill, French Kiss or Sleepless in Seattle.</p></body></html>

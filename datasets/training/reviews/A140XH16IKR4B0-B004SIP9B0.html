<meta name="summary" content="The Royal treatment"></head><body><p>The poster for "The Queen" - practically a study in Elizabeth's facial pores - led me to sense that the film would be a savage attack on the Queen and the monarchy. Instead, I found it to be an evenhanded and even sympathetic glance into the reaction of the Royal Family to British rage over their evident coolness to Princess Diana's death in 1997.<br /><br />The film portrays the events in question in a fairly straightforward manner. After Diana's final death ride, the Queen and her family are rousted from sleep and watch the unfolding story on television at Balmoral castle in Scotland, privately expressing heartfelt annoyance that Diana is again generating attention. Prince Philip (played admirably by American actor James Cromwell) is especially furious throughout the film, expressing the royals' contempt for Diana and what they felt was public mawkishness egged on by the British press. Their official reaction (except, curiously, for Prince Charles's) was unemotional and measured, driven by protocol (whether to raise the Royal standard to half staff or to make public statements) and a continuing desire to keep Diana in her place.<br /><br />Newly-elected PM Tony Blair (an incredible Michael Sheen) opposes the royals, but his close contact with them also lets him understand their point of view. Going against his young staff, whose anti-royal stance has them enjoying the Royal discomfort, Blair shows himself perhaps a bit too sympathetic to the Queen's plight, a tendency that might explain his recent woes.<br /><br />"The Queen" is a study in contrasts -- between the royal world of starchy reserve that no longer inspires, and the messiness of Tony Blair's TV-watching and cereal-chomping young family; between a confessional media culture (that Diana played to the hilt) and an older culture that prized privacy and decorum above all. The fun of the film is watching the Royals becoming aware of the need to embrace this new culture and by so doing remain at least minimally relevant to their people.<br /><br />Helen Mirren both impersonates her subject (!) and interprets her. Mirren's performance helps the audience make sense of the Queen's inner struggle as well as of her professional carapace of detachment. A scene where she throw her pack of dogs of morsel of meat, and then with a hand gesture commands them to wait (they do!) before eating it, exemplifies the self-control that Elizabeth demands of herself and expects of those around her. Only once did the movie leap the bounds of plausibility, as the Queen, driving her own truck around Balmoral at the height of the crisis, gets stuck in the middle of a river. Her sighting of a beautiful, hunted animal begins to open her eyes to her people's grief over Diana, another beautiful "animal" hunted to death. Though the scene screams "metaphor!," the script is silent, allowing the viewer to make the connection.<br /><br />The DVD extras are spare, consisting of a not-too-revelatory "making of" mini-flick.<br /><br />"The Queen" is a standout movie, very solidly cast, very well-written, daring and successful in tackling recent events, believable and illustrative of the time period. That it does not hit one over the head with facile conclusions -- and that it allows a variety of points of view to co-exist unresolved -- demonstates its confidence and is very attractive. A veddy, veddy good film.</p></body></html>

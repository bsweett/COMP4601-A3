Reilly would be worth a view, and if we were to isolate their performances in this film and leave it at that, the movie wouldn't be that bad. But that's not how movies work. Instead, we find ourselves watching a mother - freshly divorced from her cheating husband - and daughter move into a creepy apartment. It has all the makings of a momentously horrifying ending - the overly friendly Super(Reilly), the creepingly quiet maintenance man (Pete Postlethwaite - Keizer Soze's associate from The Usual Suspects), who we later find to be a porn-hound, intensifying the creepiness. There's also two teenage punks who harass Connelly's character, and a water dripping that won't stop. Oh, and a sinister voice that keeps speaking to both the mother and daughter.<br /><br />But that's where the frights end. Director Walter Salles had it all - the dark setting, the great actors - and then he goes and throws it all away. The ending, which I'm supposing was based on the novel, is downright hallow. This was one of the least satisfying endings I've ever seen in my young life.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this empty film, a story with more holes left empty than plugged.</p></body></html>

Yes it follows the old pattern of young good-looking people getting into trouble, but it does it with a verve and style that is missing form say Hostel and Capture.<br /><br />The main reason it works is because some time is spent developing the characters in the first half of the film. So when things start to go bad for the innocent trio you do have some sympathy with the nightmare that they find themselves in.<br /><br />Another important point is that this is not a Hollywood movie and as a result it does not do what Hollywood movies do. In the last 1/3 of the film there quite a few unpleasant surprises which you wouldn't get in a Hollywood film.<br /><br />It is supposed to be based on a true story, although there may have been some artistic licence. Nevertheless even if its only 50% true the events portrayed are truly nightmarish. If you are a fan of horror films you'll like this a lot, otherwise I'd advise caution!</p></body></html>

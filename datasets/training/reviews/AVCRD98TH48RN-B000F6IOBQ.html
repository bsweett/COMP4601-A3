<meta name="summary" content="The second chapter."></head><body><p>I take it upon myself to ignore the critics when it comes to Horror/Fantasy films with vampires and werewolves, for they seem simply unable to enjoy these types of films as anything more than just entertainment.  This second film is more of a continuation from the first, and not so much a sequel, much like "Kill Bill 2" picked up where the first film left off.  The difference here is that the filmmakers now have more money to throw around (thanks to the first film being a success), and it can be seen in the sleeker visual effects and huge sets.  But all that would be boring without interesting characters to watch, most notably Kate Beckinsale who is stunning to look at even when she isn't kicking bad guys in the teeth with her platform boots and wearing that now signature wet-leather cat suit shining in the glare of a full moon.  All in all, this is an action-packed Horror/Fantasy film which by the time the credits were rolling had me second guessing every film critic on the planet with a negative opinion.  If you liked "Underworld" I guarantee you will like "Underworld: Evolution."  This is, in essence, the second chapter to the story.  Thank you.</p></body></html>

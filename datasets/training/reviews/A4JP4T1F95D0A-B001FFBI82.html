So no complaints about any of the actors.  I think the story did a good job of capturing the mind set of a soldier, and the tedium that can come with being a soldier even during a war.  I wish they had spent more time covering the boot camp portion of Gyllenhaal's character.  I am a huge fan of Full Metal Jacket's boot camp beginning.  Once they get to the Gulf to fight, it is a tiny bit of a letdown.  The mother of all battles really doesn't take place as the alliance steamrolls right through the Iraqi forces.  Well made picture, but just not everything I would hope it would be.  Very nice dvd package though with tons of extras.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nicole Kidman is always beautiful , even in this terrible film . . ."></head><body><p>It takes itself a bit too seriously.  The casting is far stretched also.  A silly piece of work.<br /><br />Halle Berry would have been perfect in the role of Sylvia, but Nicole Kidman?  She is supposedly African, with an African lover, and in all the photographs within the movie and among all the other people shown as her countrymen in the USA, she is the only one who is not black.<br /><br />There is no credibility on any count, whether the casting or the very, very weak story.  Neither are the views of Manhattan, particularly in the last scene where it looks like a pastel backdrop rather than a view of the east side of the island.  A waste of time, except for watching Nicole Kidman, one of the most beautiful people on the screen today.</p></body></html>

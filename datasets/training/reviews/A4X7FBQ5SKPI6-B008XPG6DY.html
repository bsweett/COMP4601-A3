So in order to get back at Spad Bitt for cheating on her with Jon Voight's daughter/Billy Bob Thornton's ex, she plays the part of a gal who has a one night stand affair with this married guy, but then things happen that put them in a terrible situation that makes it impossible to revert the past.  Very thrilling movie for the most part, with a lot of good plot twists!  Highly Recommended for Aniston fans!!</p></body></html>

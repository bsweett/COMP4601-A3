I also own several of the Nightmare On Elm Street movies but I'm no big Freddy fan. However, when I ran across this DVD in a local video store for sale previously viewed, I figured what the heck. Overall, I think it's a pretty good movie. Freddy has been in hell and now he wants revenge but is not sure how to get it until he thinks about bringing Jason into the picture. Once the two meet up, the battle and competition begins. There are great special effects in this movie and some gore. We are taken from Freddy's world into Jason's world as they do battle. Myself, I think Jason ROCKS in this movie and I find myself rooting for Jason. When Freddy sees that Jason won't be outdone, a battle to the death begins. I like the fact that we are taken into both worlds. I think the best scene is when Jason comes out of the corn field being set on fire. As he walks around, he just slashes everyone in his path! This is a good movie for both Freddy and Jason fans. Although with the ending, you wonder if they have more in store for us!</p></body></html>

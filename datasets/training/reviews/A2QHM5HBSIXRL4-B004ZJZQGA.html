<meta name="summary" content="Martin McDonagh's indescribably brilliant creation deserves an Oscar nod"></head><body><p>It would be wonderful if this creation of writer/director's Martin McDonagh won an Oscar nomination.  [There's talk.]  It is almost indescribably brilliant.  A dark, scathing almost-comedy but also a tragic drama, it simply defies easy categorization.  You could see that in the ads (the breezy tagline "It's in Belgium!" is off-pitch).  I think the marketers no doubt struggled with how to pitch this now instant classic.  Someone did their job right though: Box Office Mojo tells me this small film raked in almost $32 million, over 75% in non-US receipts.  I suspect it'll have a nice reward in DVD sales and rentals, too, as the word gets around.  It's already lodged in IMDB's Top 250 (#233 as I write this review).<br /><br />Beyond McDonagh, credit really belongs to the great cast.  Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are magic together.  I liked Farrell saying (in the Extras on the DVD) that when he saw the script, he simply had to do it.  It was that good.  Kudos to Farrell for not simply going for the big bucks in mediocre offerings.  He's shown that type of discipline before in the underrated <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002V7SOS">Intermission</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N9CN9E">A Home At The End Of The World (Widescreen)</a>.  Playboy image aside, Colin Farrell is a serious actor with an impressive body of work to his credit.<br /><br />The actors in the supporting roles were equally sublime - this was my introduction to Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy; Thekla Reuten makes Gleeson feel homey at her inn with her warm, beautiful presence; and Jordan Prentice is fabulous.  His exchanges with Farrell are priceless.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Anger and Justice In The After Life"></head><body><p>This is a great movie. Not a happy movie, but a very moving movie. It tells the tale of victim who strives for justice in the afterlife, and her family who is hoping for justice while trying to move on with their own lives. Her family struggles to maintain some semblance of a normal life, but with great difficulty. This makes for a very emotionally draining performance from these actors. The victim, Suzy Salmon, is forced to deal with the uncertainty of finding peace in death. Confusing and unclear, death forces Suzy to focus on what her life meant for others. The movie offers a great view of the emotions associated with such a tragedy. You should get this one and watch, it is worth it.</p></body></html>

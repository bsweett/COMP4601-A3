But then again, unknowingly, Star Trek's culture has imbedded into our day to  day living.  If you say phrases like &quot;Beam Me Up, Scottie&quot;;  &quot;Live Long &amp; Prosper&quot; whilst displaying the V sign, your  friends just understand immediately what you're implying.  Anyway, my girl  friend came with me to the cinema reluctantly &amp; she couldn't help  shaking her head noticing that the cinema was filled with males especially  the geeky type, something like me!  Anyway, when the movie started, she  couldn't help laughing her heads off with the goofy storyline.  On top of  the mockery of the Star Trek series, what I'm finding this movie endearing  is seeing all those familiar actors from TV series such as Elliott in Just  Shoot Me, Mitchell from Veronica's Closet, Tim Allen in Home Improvement,  the taxi guy from Wings strutting their stuff.  What's even amusing is  seeing Sigourney Weaver playing a busty bimbo (a far cry from her Ripley  role in Alien &amp; sequels), &amp; Alan Rickman virtually playing himself  as an actor with English theatre background forcing himself re-enacting the  role of  this Spock character again &amp; again &amp; still, the spotlight  is always taken by Tim Allen who's potraying the role of William Shatner.  What's even more delightful about the movie is that in the end, good  prevails over evil. The underlying themes of the movies would be the  significance of teamwork, &amp; self belief. A wonderful film to be shared  with family members &amp; friends.  What's even more unbelievable is that  my girl friend can't wait for the sequel, if there's any!  On the sideline,  Stan Winston, the special effect guy who had brought us the Alien creature  is in his usual best. By the way, the space ship is as corny as ever.</p></body></html>

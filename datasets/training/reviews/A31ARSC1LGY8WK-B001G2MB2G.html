<meta name="summary" content="The fifth Harry Potter film should please fans of the series"></head><body><p>"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" - the fifth Harry Potter film - is the most sombre and subdued so far.<br /><br />It has the usual stunning special effects but there is more a focus on the characters especially Harry Potter himself who is beginning to understand the burden he bears.<br /><br />JK Rowling and the film-makers continue to successfully create a parallel magical universe for us to explore.<br /><br />Dolores Umbridge (played by Imelda Staunton) is right up there with other Potter villains playing a smug Margaret Thatcher-like matron sent to tidy up Hogwarts.<br /><br />Harry Potter's first screen kiss plays a very small part in the film and his relationship with Cho Chang is never explored.<br /><br />This is not really a film for little kids but fans of the series will not be disappointed.</p></body></html>

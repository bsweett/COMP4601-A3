<meta name="summary" content="A cult movie!"></head><body><p>Die hard meant a true twist of change in what concerns the previous referential patterns about what it should be a breathtaking thriller, that blended with accurate measure, the required doses of action, suspense, around a complex and well planed terrorist attack into the same entrails of a fortified corporation, butt the presence of this refreshing action hero, who is an outlaw, and beware of this apparently simple detail: a hard fan of John Wayne who meant the most emblematic icon along seven decades in the American Cinema, remit us to many other similar situations.<br /><br />But there is much more to watch. The admirable dynamism and formidable employment of the camera as witness silent that scrutinizes and joins us through tunnels, audacious sequences and countless of adrenaline, from start to finish, spiced with some touches of sentimentalism (the dialogue between Mac Lean and the police officer), conform a formidable movie with a lot of unforgettable sequences plenty of high tension moments in which Bruce Wills signed his name with golden letters thanks among other factors the fact to elevate the dimension of an urban hero that fights in many levels, to establish the raped code of security in order to disentangle the horrid of this terrorist gang, and prove himself as hard to die police agent, capable to make the most unimaginable strategies to avoid by all his means the materialization of the pretended goal.<br /><br />Kudos too for Alan Rickman and Alexander Godunov (prematurely died after this film) who featured with admirable and crude the embodiment of the evilness and nasty repulsion for the audience.<br /><br />Since its immediate release, in 1989 I suspected and foresaw for this film the label of a contemporary cult movie category.</p></body></html>

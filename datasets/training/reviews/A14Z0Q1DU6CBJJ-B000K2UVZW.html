I love murder mysteries, fiction or non-fiction. What better murder case to do a movie about then the BLACK DAHLIA? This is one of the most notorious and high profile yet to be solved murders in history. The suspects. The crime scene. The girl. The whys. Who was she? Why was she there and how did she end up neatly and surgically severed in half on the side of the road?<br /><br />Well, if you watch this movie, you'll still be wondering because Elizabeth Short i.e. THE BLACK DAHLIA, is a SIDE STORY! That's right. There is so little time spent on the murder mystery and the evidence of the crime that my wife and I joked, "no wonder the crime has never been solved."<br /><br />I'm not sure of the exact time, but it was at least 40 minutes into the film before they even found the body.<br /><br />In short, the movie should not have been called THE BLACK DAHLIA. The Black Dahlia is just a ploy to get you into the theatre in order to watch a movie about two ex-boxers and friends who are in love with the same girl and smoke a lot of cigarettes. They stumble across the very minimal clues that lead to the ridiculous and fictionalized ending.<br /><br />This was a hugely disappointing and boring waste of a potentially great premise for a film.<br /><br />I'm a fan of James Elroy, but in the special features he says that he's paying homage to Elizabeth Short with this film. I think they call it CAPITALIZING, because that's what this is. It doesn't explore the murder at all. It doesn't explore the whys. We don't even get to know who Elizabeth Short was. Then to make matters worse, they came up with a fictionalized ending that doesn't do anybody any justice, especially not the viewer... who's most likely asleep by the that time anyway.</p></body></html>

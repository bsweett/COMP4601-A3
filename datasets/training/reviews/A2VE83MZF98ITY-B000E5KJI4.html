There are too many deviations from the ancient Greek epic poem for this to be other than `inspired by' - there are characters missing (Cassandra, etc.); there are characters whose fates are different from the Illiad (I won't give spoilers, so you'll have to trust me), and the overall situation is cast in a very different light.<p>In the film, Achilles (Brad Pitt, looking more bulky than usual) is the greatest warrior alive, with a reputation unparalleled in the world.  However, he is a loose canon of sorts, as likely to kill his own leaders as the enemy.  Achilles is tempted to the battle with Troy, portrayed as one of the greatest battles in history, by the call of everlasting glory.  Achilles is persuaded in the end by no less an ironic character than his own mother, who recounts to him the prophecy of an idyllic life at home should he stay, but then to be forgotten after he dies, or the chance at immortality in legend, despite the fact that he'll die at Troy.  Achilles sets sail.<p>The war with Troy is portrayed as having been going on for a decade; at a peace meeting in Sparta, Paris (younger prince of Troy, Orlando Bloom) falls in love with the fair `was this the face that launched a thousand ships' Helen, wife Sparta's king, Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson).  Helen steals away with Paris on the ship returning to Troy;  Hector, the elder prince and heir to the throne (Eric Bana) is conflicted as to what to do, but opts to journey on to Troy, and the die is cast.<p>Agamemnon (Brian Cox) uses the event as a chance to band all the Greek city-states together into a final battle with Troy, the greatest rival to his power in the Aegean (and the centre of much of the civilization of the world at that time).  This is where the retelling becomes much more modern than ancient.  The Illiad is not so concerned with economics and hegemonies as it is with ethics and honour - Agamemnon is portrayed as a Realpolitick power-seeker of the first order, willing to stop at nothing to decimate allies and foes alike for his own power, willing to use honourable pretenses to achieve dishonourable ends.  Does one sense a thinly-veiled critique of the modern siege-makers in this?<p>An astonishing armada is amassed and sets sail for the coasts of Troy.  Once there, the beachhead is taken, and the first major act is a desecration of the temple of Apollo (a dishonouring of the local gods - again, does one sense a critique of the moderns here?) by Achilles, who nonetheless proves himself the most valuable warrior the Greeks have.  At this point, the internal strife becomes as problematic for the Greeks as the front lines, as Achilles disregards the commands of Agamemnon and cares little for the political outcomes of the war.  <p>The intrigues and the plotting of the Greek leaders are cast in high relief against the more pastoral leadership of `good king' Priam (portrayed by Peter O'Toole with his characteristic panache).  Hector is a strong and wise leader under his father; Paris is the foolish and rather cowardly one.  (We are missing the back-story of the Illiad of how Paris came to be part of Troy's royal family, and it is assumed that there is no unusual story there.)  We rather lose sight of the fact that, indeed, Paris stole the queen of Sparta (again, the modern idea creeps in - in our day, a woman would have the right to choose where she wished to live, but not so in the ancient world; one might question whether the queen of a nation has the right to abandon her role and `shack-up' with the neighbouring prince at will, but I digress...).  <p>The people of Troy are seen as virtuous despite the fact that they are defending the less-defensible position morally.  The Greeks might have right on their side in some respects, but this is lost in their brutality and by the unbridled greed of their leaders, and of course it is the ordinary foot-soldiers, including Achilles, who have to do the fighting and dying for the cause, as their princes exchange gifts of gold, money and priceless art treasures to congratulate themselves on their victories.  <p>The film portrays the battle lasting only a matter of a few weeks; the brutality of the battle scenes is as dramatic as any in modern war films, just as bloody.  The single-combat scenes between Achilles and Hector, Hector and Patroclus, and others are extremely well choreographed, introducing various techniques I've not seen before in sword-play films.  <p>I don't think it is a spoiler to give away the major ending here, in that Troy eventually falls, not to military might, but to trickery.  The Greek ships have sailed, leaving only an  offering to Poseidon behind - a giant horse.  The Trojan Horse (if the Greeks built it, why is it always called `the Trojan Horse?') is carted into the city whose walls cannot be breeched, and the people celebrate their victory.  As they rest after the revelry, Greek soldier inside the horse emerge (including in this telling, Achilles), open the gates to the city, and the Greek army swarms in.  <p>A nice touch to the film is the hand-off of the great sword of Troy to a young man named Aeneas, with the instruction that so long as a Trojan has the sword, Troy will live on (this connects to the Roman epic poem, the Aeneid, which tells of Aeneas' journey from Troy to Rome, making them the spiritual successors of Troy, particularly meaningful when the Romans then conquer the Greeks).  <p>The effects are great, as is the general cinematography.  This is a film to be seen in the theatres, for the `big screen' effect.</p></body></html>

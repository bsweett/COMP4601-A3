<meta name="summary" content="NOT EXACTLY INCREDIBLE..BUT SUPERIOR TO THE FORMER"></head><body><p>Let me say straight away, this film is much better than the Ang Lee/Eric Bana mess, but really that's not saying much.  Look, Im no fan of Edward Norton, he's surly, unattractive, and never has any chemistry with his female leads, I suppose maybe they find him as hideous as I do, but I digress.  Honestly, he's not bad in this, Banner is sort of a loner and skin flint, so it works in this role, though again no sparks between he and Tyler.  The Abomination is a great choice as a villian, he's as stong as the Hulk and much more destructive, the Hulk was never as blessed as Spider Man when it came to villian in the Marvel Universe, the Abomination is about as good as he ever got.  I wish he had appeared earlier in the film, we only really get to see him in full form at the end when he tangles with the Hulk.  The million dollar question is..did the CGI Hulk work this time, and in my opinion he did, he looked much more real, though still obviously CGI, but his face was more expressive.  The pace of the film is a bit slow, but not nearly the glacial pace of the Ang Lee film and as it neared the end it really picked up, though ironically I feel the best part of the film was the begining when Banner is chased all over the slums of Rio, yes, it was very "Jason Bourne", but all action films crib from Bourne these days.  Overall, hardly Ironman, but a pretty good action film, and as a huge Hulk comic fan when I was a kid, Im very grateful about that fact.  Oh and the camios by Lou Ferrigno, Bill Bixby and the iconic Stan Lee are all nice touches.</p></body></html>

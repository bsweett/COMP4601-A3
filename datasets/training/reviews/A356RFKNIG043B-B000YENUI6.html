<meta name="summary" content="Easily Cronenberg's best; Viggo is superb"></head><body><p>Beautifully shot and tightly scripted, Eastern Promises is both brutal and touching. Cronenberg shows that he's matured immensely and presents a truly solid, almost flawless crime flick with many emotional overtones. Mortenson is tremendous, showing little but revealing much.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the script, not one cheesy line in the movie, and the plot moves organically towards a satisfying finale. The over-ballyhooed nude shower scene is notable not for Viggo's hanging wang as for the stark realism of the violence, which is all too realistic. Too much so for my taste, but I've always found Cronenberg overly violent and squirm-inducing; remember Shivers and Videodrome?<br /><br />In any case, this is his finest outing on most every front, and he's really learned to handle actors and get their best work. Watts is also excellent, as is Stahl (a very fine performer indeed in almost all he does). Shore's score is very fine, but you can hear echoes of LOTR and I almost expected orcs to come jumping out of a closet at various points.<br /><br />Not recommended for kids or those who can't stomach occasional very graphic violence, EP is very much recommended for movie lovers who appreciate tight, edgy crime thrillers.</p></body></html>

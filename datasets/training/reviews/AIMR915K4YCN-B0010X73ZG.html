Due to King's various creatures slithering, buzzing, or towering above like walking skyscrapers, I figured a movie would never materialize. Thank God for Frank Darabont! He uses just enough cgi to keep things interesting. After all, the hideous monsters in the mist are only as frightening as the  human monsters that emerge during the invasion. The folks trapped in the grocery store become their own worst enemies, nearly dooming themselves without much help from any titanic terrors! Marcia Gay Harden (The Dead Girl) is perfectly twisted as the bible-waving Mrs. Carmody. Mr. Drayton (Thomas Jane) tries logic, common sense, and other such useless tools in a hopeless attempt to reason w/ the unbalanced prophet, who soon gathers a group of mindless followers! So, while an army of creatures lumber about outside, the humans fight an epic battle of wills inside. Very well done. Yes, the ending is different from the book. It's also a dark, merciless final&eacute; to this tale of building dread. So, if you can only handle happy endings, you might want to watch YOU'VE GOT MAIL again instead...  P.S.- I liked all the characters in this. Laurie Holden (Silent Hill, tvs X-Files) is especially good...</p></body></html>

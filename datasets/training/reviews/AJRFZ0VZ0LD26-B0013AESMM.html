<meta name="summary" content="Jodi Foster at her very best"></head><body><p>It seems to me that Jodi Foster does not age.  Which, of course, is a beautiful thing.  Her eyes are piercing blue and translucent that give her particularly dreamy look in this movie.  She plays a woman who is attacked, along with her fiancee, in the NYC's Central Park as they walk the dog.  It is sensless and brutal beating and the scenes about the attack are disturbing.  While Erica Bain (Foster's character) survives the attack, her boyfriend is killed.  Considering how much in love they both were with each other, this outcome is devastating for Erica.  before long, she is cruising streets of New York at night taking vengeance on the bad guys in the grocery stores, subway and even her attackers.  During this she becomes friends withthe police detective who connects wih Erica's feelings onthe emotional level.  Being recently divirced, he suferred "a little death" compared to the real death of her boyfrined.  Both people are devastated by their lost companions and the lonely, cruel world thay are left into.  They understand each other completely and that is what saves this film at the end.  The strongest point of the movie is Foster's voice (she is a radio person) and her quiet narration of her New York stories is riveting.  Her voice is mesmerizing and her "stories" true beauty of this film.  If there is a book on tape with Jodi Foster narrating it, I want to know - because I want HER to tell me the story.</p></body></html>

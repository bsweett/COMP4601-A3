<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining vehicle for Damon"></head><body><p>Based on the popular series by author Robert Ludlum, The Bourne Identity finds amnesiac CIA Agent Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) on the lam from assassins sent by his superior (Chris Cooper) while he recruits a down on her luck German woman (Franka Potente) to help him piece together his identity.  Entertaining from start to finish, the Bourne Identity is solid crowd pleasing entertainment and a more than solid vehicle for Matt Damon who gives an excellent performance.  The action can lag at some points, and it's nowhere as good as Ludlum's book, but this is still a solid mainstream action pic worth checking out.  Also featuring Brian &quot;the original Hannibal Lecter&quot; Cox and Julia Stiles.</p></body></html>

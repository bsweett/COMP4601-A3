In the Jan.-Feb. 2005 issue of 'Scholastic Instructor,' a bit of trivia about this movie is the amount paid ($7,827) to the Harrison School in L.A. just for using the exterior in this movie.  Seems to me that is public domain, if they did not go inside.  And to beat all, it was filmed at night.  What was there to see to earn this type of money?  Perhaps the director or producer had been a student there at one time or another.  You can see why there were no 'extras' and Tom had only one outfit. I did like Tom Cruise's white hair and spiffy gray suit. Nice for a change.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx was funny as the unwilling accomplice/cab driver.  A taxi driver needs only one uniform, no changes for him either.  Now I understand why so many 'American' movies are filmed in Canada!</p></body></html>

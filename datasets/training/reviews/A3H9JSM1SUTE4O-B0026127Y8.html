<meta name="summary" content="LEAN AND MEAN ACTION FLICK DELIVERS"></head><body><p>Liam Neeson is terrific as a divorced dad with special skills who does not flinch when it comes to rescuing his daughter half a world away.  So called "white slavery" is very real and Leeson pulls no punches in the single-minded pursuit of dealing the first deadly blow to those who profit from the human trade.<br /><br />This very fast-paced actioner does not rely on gimmicky technology or special effects.  One-to-one human combat (Isreali style?) prevails in tightly choreographed fights that are believable.<br /><br />I saw the Euro version -- probably a few minutes of added intensity.<br /><br />Neeson ought to consider this character as a franchise.  Kinda made me think of a slightly older Bourne.<br /><br /> Recommended.</p></body></html>

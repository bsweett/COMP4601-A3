<meta name="summary" content="The British establishment in crisis"></head><body><p>As an American, I have never quite "gotten" the role that the British Monarchy plays in the government and life of Great Britain. This film went far towards explaining this, as the British establishment reeled after the death of Princess Diana. Tony Blair had just taken up his duties as Prime Minister when this tragedy struck. The nexus of this film is the struggle between Blair and the Queen concerning how the Monarchy should react to Diana's death. The British public demanded that the House of Windsor address the issue publicly, while the Queen implacably sought to keep out of the public eye during this turmoil. The Queen, at least according to this film, initially treated Blair with contempt, but eventually is forced to see that Blair correctly understood what the public demanded of the Monarchy. One interesting line in the film is where the Queen reflects that "when a Queen loses touch with her subjects, maybe it is time for her to step aside in favor of a new generation..." Now there is food for thought...<br /><br />This film depicts the Queen as a dignified lady, steeped in tradition, who is nevertheless hopelessly out of touch with public opinion and suffering from not a little over-arrogance. Tony Blair forces her to see that the Monarchy, in the end, must serve the people and meet their expectations. In one scene she sits in depression, staring at a newspaper headline "Queen Bends the Knee to Blair." Yes, that about summed it up.<br /><br />Helen Mirren absolutely nails the role of the Queen in this film, and Michael Sheen does very well as Tony Blair. All of the supporting actors do well. This is a quality film that successfully captures the turmoil that Diana's death caused for the British Establishment. It is also excellent entertainment.</p></body></html>

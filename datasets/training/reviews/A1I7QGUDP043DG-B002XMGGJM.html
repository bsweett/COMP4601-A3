Helping the viewer empathize with a killer is extremely difficult, but this story does just that. Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler are complicated characters with many layers and realistic depth. We can't help but feel torn as we go on the emotional journey with a loving father who is pulled into a horrible crime and has a different perspective about how we obtain punishment than Foxx's character. The story has interesting peaks and twists in the action scenes to shake up the genre. A very thought provoking action/thriller that is sure to spark some dinner debates over who the real 'bad guy' is between the two characters.</p></body></html>

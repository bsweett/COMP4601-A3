<meta name="summary" content="Really Wanted to Like This Movie"></head><body><p>I skipped seeing this movie at the theatre because it just didn't seem good enough for me to spend $20 on tickets and concessions, and I'm glad I did.  I really did want to like this movie.  I enjoyed the story idea, the technological "wow" factor, the homage to 1940s serials; but the wooden acting and hackneyed plot just brought the movie down.  Yeah, the whole technological razzle dazzle was a sight to behold, but too many times you could tell that the actors were standing in front of fake scenery and each time I saw Gwyneth Paltrow attempt to run around in those heels, I just had to chuckle; I mean, she looked more like she was running in place!  There are certainly some great moments in the film:  the arial battles, the 1940s look, and the inclusion of an actor who's been dead for more than 15 years.  Overall, it just wasn't enough to rate higher than three starts.  There is definately potential here and I hope the fact that the movie was a major flop in the theatres won't deter Conran or others like him from trying this again.  Just get a better story and work out some of the kinks.</p></body></html>

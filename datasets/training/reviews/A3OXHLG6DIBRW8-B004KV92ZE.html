Po (nicely voiced by Jack Black) is an affable but somewhat overweight Panda that dreams of becoming a Kung Fu Master. Sadly, his lot in life seems to be making and selling noodles for his father (he was adopted) and all of the Kung Fu glory reserved for the "Furious Five" (who even have a line of action figures). All of that changes when chance lands him in the roll of the "Dragon Warrior" and his Kung Fu training begins in earnest... just in time to face the powerful escaped villainous snow leopard, Tai Lung (Ian McShane).<br /><br />Like most martial arts movies, there is significant violence but it is mostly of the slapstick cartoon variety. There is a very positive message for kids that comes through loud and clear, don't judge people based on looks and preconceptions.<br /><br />The animation is good and the voice acting is enjoyable with Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogan, David Cross, Lucy Liu and.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Machete"></head><body><p>The fake trailer comes to life thanks to Robert Rodriguez. Danny Trejo stars as Machete, a bad ass who rarely speaks during the movie. The story is about him being set up to take the fall against a senator who is against illgeal immagrants. Why explain the story? The movie is full of non-stop action but does follow a story. Some people may hate it though but I really didnt care. The movie looks censored, so it could get an r-rating, but im sure this dvd will be released uncensored. A very good, action packed film with the usual laughs. A must for action lovers. I love how the 80's action films seem to be creeping back, although critics call them failures because they dont make money. Movies like Machete, Preadators, and The Expendables made a great summer. Go out of your way to see this.</p></body></html>

Five reasons offhand: No James Cameron. No Linda Hamilton. No Brad Fiedel score. No Edward Furlong. And (as of T2) no future for the Terminators to come back from.<br /><br />But Jonathan Mostow has done a pretty good job with this one. Not perfect -- for example, I don't find Kristanna Loken's T-X anywhere near as menacing as Robert Patrick's T-1000 -- but it's not bad at all. And his non-sappy ending returns the Terminator series to its pessimistic tech-noir roots.<br /><br />Nick Stahl's okay as John Connor; I miss Furlong, but Stahl looks as though he could actually _be_ the love child of Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn. And Claire Danes is surprisingly effective as Kate Brewster, John's future second-in-command and spouse. Marco Beltrami's score is good too, although I still miss the main theme from the old one. (We hear Beltrami's arrangement of it over the closing credits, but that's it.)<br /><br />Arnold, of course, is Arnold, and he's still why we watch. The stunts and special effects are very good.<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending for you, but the outcome of this one may surprise you. In fact, it restores quite a bit of what T2 undid.<br /><br />The omitted 'Sgt. Candy scene' is delightful, but it's by far the best item in the bonus materials. Generally, on the Terminator DVDs, the deleted scenes are helpful in understanding certain plot points; this one's no exception.<br /><br />All in all, a nice addition to the Terminator series. Will there be more?</p></body></html>

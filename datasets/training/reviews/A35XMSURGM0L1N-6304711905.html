<meta name="summary" content="Just like ony old western, except..."></head><body><p>Tombstone is about the Immortal Wyatt Earp and his brothers in a town called Tombstone where they came to make a new living but took up the side of the law again to fight evil cowboys. There are running horses, saloonfights and a lot of gunbattles, so nothing new there. And a little romance of course. Even the titles in the end scene are western like<p>What makes this movie stand out a little about the others is the acting performance of Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. His accent is perfect and he plays a dying man very convincingly. This is the only reason you should really see it.</p></body></html>

They already had a previous movie to get all the introductions and explanations out of the way. This was a team movie and there was a lot of background information to cover before any actual story could begin. This movie was every bit as good as X-Men 1 and Spider-Man 1. If there is a sequel made of Fantastic Four, I'm sure it will be just as good as those movies. So be kind to Fantastic Four. Sure, Mr. Fantastic is lame but I mean Human Torch is cool! And Jessica Alba is hot! What more do you really need?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Magical romantic-mystery thriller set in turn-of-the-century Vienna"></head><body><p>Set against the backdrop of turn-of-the-century Vienna "The Illusionist" uses slight-of-hand story telling and is a visually stunning treat. Magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton)returns to Vienna after wandering the world learning the tricks of his trade. His magic dazzles people but a former romance with the crown prince of Vienna's (Rufus Sewell)fianc&eacute;e  Sophie (Jessica Biel)threatens to derail his career when Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti in a stunning performance)is charged with arresting him or running him out of the city.<br /><br />Director Neil Burger has created a marvelous period piece with an intriguing romantic thriller at the heart of this film. The beautiful cinematography and Phillip Glass' marvelous score are wonderfully recreated on this sharp looking DVD.<br /><br />Fans expecting a lot of special features will be disappointed by the paltry ones included here. I suspect that there will probably be a special edition down the road, because considering the magic the film produces, there's a lot more tha could be discussed/shown. We get a 9 minute featurette with the cast and crew discussing how enticed they were with the material. There's also an interview with Jessica Biel discussing the film (which is an extension of the interview featured in the making of featurette on the film). The best special feature is the running commentary by director Neil Burger (sadly Giamatti, Norton and Biel are missing from the commentary track). Burger discusses his opinions of the actors (he was surprised and impressed with what Biel brought to her performance and points out the little touches that Norton & Giamatti introduced to their characters to bring added depth)to the magic tricks seen in the film whether they be "real" magic or CGI magic. It's an interesting commentary track but I'd watch the film first all the way through as there are spoilers in the commentary track.<br /><br />"The Illusionist" was a pleasant surprise with its strong performances and deft direction by Neil Burger. I should warn fans of fast paced action thrillers that this film takes its time in unspooling the story but the pacing works for the film.<br /><br />While there are many who insist on comparing "The Illusionist" and "The Prestige" (the other movie set against the background of magic)the only thing they share in common is a mystery and the magic. In "The Illusionist" the magic background is used for a romantic mystery-thriller while "The Prestige" uses the same backdrop for a tale of obsession, rivalry and revenge. Beyond that the films have little in common (including the way the stories are told). Comparing the two is like comparing the flavor of an orange and a tangerine--they're both fruit, both citrus but both have their own unique flavor. Sure some people will prefer one to the other but that doesn't mean one is inherently superior to the other--it depends on one's preference.</p></body></html>

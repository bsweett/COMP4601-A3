The SX are great, but the story seems forced and artificial.  I'm not a comic book fan at all, and do not know the comic iron man story, so i'm likely at a disadvantage.  however, the antagonist seems to just be there and be a formidable foe, no real development to that plot evolution.  at the same time, this is an action movie first and foremost, so perhaps i'm asking too much.  it just wasn't climactic - the final battle happens, and its not satisfying. otherwise, downey is awesome, the dialog is fun, etc.</p></body></html>

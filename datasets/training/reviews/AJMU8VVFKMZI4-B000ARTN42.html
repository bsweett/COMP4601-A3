<meta name="summary" content="Nothing new in Hollywood"></head><body><p>3.5 Stars. I agree with another reviewer... I have been here before.  I like Ron Howard's movies, I do. (my favorite Apollo 13)  And though this movie is about a real person (just like A beautiful Mind and Seabiscuit) this film offers nothing new.  Yes, it's well acted--but it feels like a movie made for the sole purpose of an Academy Award vehicle.  See Russell Crowe act.  See Renee Z. act.  The one who stood out above the rest was Paul Giamatti who, IMHO, has blindsided the world in the past two years with his acting chops and range.<br /><br />Back to the film.  Jimmy is perfect.  He doesn't abide by stealing no matter how hungry the family is, he works everyday, and comes to the rescue of damsels in distress.  He doesn't curse, never raises his voice...I mean, c'mon.  I think there is a danger in creating perfect characters.  I can't relate to them..and I doubt this is the truth.  Hollywood uses their artistic freedom card frequently.<br /><br />It's a descent film but I wasn't wowed.</p></body></html>

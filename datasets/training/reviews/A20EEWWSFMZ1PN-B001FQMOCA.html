<meta name="summary" content="This is a story about redemption."></head><body><p>I have always enjoyed both Johnny and June. But I was not too interested in their lives. And I have to admit that this film was a bit depressing at first. It reminded me too much of Steinbeck. I started to question my purchase when before I could finish the thought, I was sucked into their life and this movie. This adds a new perspective on the classic songs. We see that they were just people and subject to personalities and environments as we all are.<br /><br />You will find these songs going through your head days after viewing this movie. Note at the ending credits the real thing as the real duo sings "Long Legged Guitar Pickin' Man"</p></body></html>

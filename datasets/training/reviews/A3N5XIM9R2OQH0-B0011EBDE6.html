<meta name="summary" content="Well, I liked it..."></head><body><p>In the five years or so following the heaps of acclaim bestowed upon Bottle Rocket and Rushmore, and the commercial success of The Royal Tenenbaums, those who consider Wes Anderson a genius and an innovator seem to have lost some ground to those who consider him the worst thing to happen to cinema since someone decided it would be a good idea to start making movies out of video games.  Still, there's no denying that Anderson remains a premier visual stylist, and over the course of his last two movies the ambition of his storytelling has started to catch up with his artistic vision and his well-documented influences.  His most recent work, the Darjeeling Limited, continues in the globetrotting vein of its classic predecessor The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, while indulging pretty much all of the fetishes (alienated characters, meticulous wardrobe and set design, British Invasion and world music, Owen Wilson) that make Anderson's movies so quickly recognizable.  Like all of his movies, it at least looks good, which makes it a step up from the sitcom-style direction that marks a lot of Hollywood comedies these days, and as usual Anderson avoids the overreliance on contrived quirks that indie movies so often give in to.<br /><br />If you belong to the faction who say (not without reason) that Anderson's movies dwell excessively on familial dysfunction and father issues, The Darjeeling Limited definitely won't do much to answer your criticisms.  Following three estranged American brothers (Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, and Jason Schwartzman) who reunite a year after their father's death for a train trip across India, the movie explores the lingering divide between its relationship-impaired characters with Anderson's usual sympathy even as he pokes fun at their failings.  In a device only Anderson could get away with, Wilson's alpha-brother Francis lays out the parameters early on--a spiritual journey open to anything, no matter how shocking or painful--complete with an itinerary provided by Francis's alapecea-stricken assistant.  Of course, this being an Anderson movie, the trip quickly descends into a morass of resentment, backbiting, and fractured relationships, all conveyed with his usual deadpan humor and a bit of slapstick thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />While I have to admit I was a little bummed about the near-total absence of Bill Murray this time around, if nothing else The Darjeeling Limited does mark another chapter in the fruitful collaboration of Anderson and Owen Wilson.  While their long-time connection hasn't quite reached the level of Scorsese-DeNiro or Kurosawa-Mifune,  the quality of their directing/acting/sometimes writing partnership does at least put them in the company of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg.  Of late Wilson seems to have been in a contest with Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn to see who can appear in the most mediocre Hollywood comedies, but he's always done good work with Anderson whether he co-wrote or not, and his performance here is a nice variation on the wide-eyed optimist persona that he first developed in Bottle Rocket.  As Francis's brothers and travel partners, Brody manages to at least add a layer of reflectiveness to his usual bland competence, while Schwartzman (sporting a classic adult-film mustache) skillfully projects the same mix of innocence and smarm that he brought to his Rushmore breakthrough.<br /><br />While Anderson's movies have never precisely taken place in the real world, The Darjeeling Limited does see him bringing his whimsical style to an exploration of cultural convergence as its wealthy, entitled protagonists find themselves adrift in a more traditional (and, the movie shows, in some ways backward) society.  Fittingly, it's not until the brothers are forced to deviate from their pre-planned itinerary that the trip really gets going, with their reconciliation mirroring their engagement with India and its more out-of-the-way locales.  Much like on The Life Aquatic, Anderson clearly made a playground of his exotic locations, and it all shows up in the film.  From some great, Scorsese-esque tracking shots inside the train to claustrophobic cityscapes to expansive cinematography of the Indian countryside, the setting figures as extensively in this movie as Anderson's old high school in Rushmore or the high seas in The Life Aquatic, adding another layer of the personality that's always set Anderson movies apart.<br /><br />Overall, aside from Anderson's usual visual flair, The Darjeeling Limited contains more than enough characterization and humor to be another sytlish and entertaining entry in the Wes Anderson filmography.  Not quite as essential as some of his other films, but if you like his prior work you should find a lot to enjoy in this one.</p></body></html>

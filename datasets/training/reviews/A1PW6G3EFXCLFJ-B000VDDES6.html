How else to explain my negative reaction to this hilarious (NOT!) movie. On the other hand, if I was in a bad mood, shouldn't a good comedy have cheered me up? The answer to this seeming contraction is, of course, that ANCHORMAN may be a stupid, inane, badly-written film. On the other hand, maybe I'm just not the type of guy who enjoys farce that much. That would quite possibly put me in the category of an up-tight someone who needs to chill out. Or, again, it could be that ANCHORMAN is simply a stinker of a movie. Maybe these things come down to taste. However, for me, the bottom line is I just didn't think ANCHORMAN or Will Ferrell was funny. Your call.</p></body></html>

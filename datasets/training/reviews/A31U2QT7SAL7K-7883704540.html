<meta name="summary" content="The kind of film that Uncle Walt would've made!"></head><body><p>When the trailers for this film first started their television run, I had some reservations about it.  Here we have a movie about a rat, the most disgusting of creatures, with culinary ambitions in France!!!<br /><br />Heaven forbid!<br /><br />However, after having seen the film, I had to change my tune.  "Ratatouille" is a thoroughly entertaining movie that is perfect family fare for the summer.<br /><br />Of course, some of the storyline is bit above the heads of the real small fry (They need a little more appreciation of the restaurant biz).  However, that aside, the movie carries on the tradition of wholesome entertainment, started by the late Mr. Disney.<br /><br />In fact, "Ratatouille" probably comes closest to being in the Disney mold than any of the previous Disney/Pixar collaborations in terms of story, attention to detail, scoring, and inspired casting.<br /><br />Peter O'Toole and Brad Garrett are fantastic in their small but significant roles.<br /><br />And the scenes of Paris: "Tres magnifique!"</p></body></html>

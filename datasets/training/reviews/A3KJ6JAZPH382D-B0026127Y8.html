<meta name="summary" content="Get Taken"></head><body><p>If this was 1987 or 88, this would have been a star-vehicle for the likes of Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger. But they have moved past their heyday, and in Arnold's case, even past acting. But would anyone ever have pictured a mild mannered characther actor to deliver as stunning a performance as Liam Neeson does in Luc Besson's "Taken?" Step back and be prepared..."Taken" gets almost everything an actioner could get perfect.<br /><br />Neeson steps up to the plate as a retired special operations soldier/spy who feels like he needs to be a better dad. What could be a better way to prove your worth than to rescue your daughter when she gets kidnapped by a sex-slave ring? While Neeson tends to deliver deep character studies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007PALGG">Kinsey,</a> this time he goes all "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L5SRJE">24</a>" on us and starts busting up the baddies. At the same time, he shows his anguish under all the bravado, elevating "Taken" from the generic.<br /><br />Writer/Producer Besson is no stranger to this turf; he all but perfected it when he introduced America to Jean Reno and Natalie Portman in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GVJEE">Leon - The Professional (Deluxe Edition)</a>. What he does with "Taken" is make you remember that even Jack Bauer types are family men, even as they manage to dodge the bullets of Middle Eastern gangs with an arsenal of M-16's. If it weren't for Neeson's take on Spy-Dad Bryan Mills, "Taken" could have easily devolved into a random revenge flick. Economical, tight and loaded with whupazz, "Taken" shows that an action film can dish up both brains and brawn.</p></body></html>

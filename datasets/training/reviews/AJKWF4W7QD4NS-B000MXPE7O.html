<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing"></head><body><p>Given everything that the Good Shepherd has going for it on paper alone, saying the overall result is disappointing is saying it a bit lightly.  Robert De Niro's "pet project" and first directorial effort since A Bronx Tale, the Good Shepherd follows the life of the brilliant Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) and the beginnings and origins of the CIA.  Throughout the film, we witness the career triumps of Wilson as well as his personal failures that haunt him throughout the years.  The multi-layered, fact based script justifies the nearly three hour running time, but the overall effect of the Good Shepherd just doesn't perform nearly as well as it should.  Damon is wooden to say the least, while Angelina Jolie's talent is wasted as Wilson's long suffering wife.  There are notable supporting actors as well, including De Niro himself, Alec Baldwin, John Turturro, William Hurt, Timothy Hutton, Billy Crudup, Michael Gambon, 2001's Keir Dullea, and the great Joe Pesci (making his first screen appearance in almost a decade), but none of them are around long enough to make much impact.  Not to mention that the deliberately slow pacing of the film can really be difficult to sit through, and while the Good Shepherd isn't a bad film one bit, it is a disappointment nonetheless.  All in all, fans of fact based spy films or De Niro should definitely give the Good Shepherd a look, but be well forewarned before entering.</p></body></html>

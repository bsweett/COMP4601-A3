<meta name="summary" content="Why does everyone hate this film?"></head><body><p>Having not been too impressed by the comic book series on which this was based, I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but this adventure-fantasy filled with 19th century literary characters turned out to be an entertaining couple of hours. Bring together Allan Quartermain (Sean Connery), the Invisible Man, Captain Nemo, Nina Harker (a vampire), Dorian Gray, Dr. Jekyll (and, of course, Mr. Hyde), and an American referred to only as "Agent Sawyer," and put them under the direction of a government figure called "M," and you have a formidable force for saving the world. And the world certainly needs saving, or at least Venice and parts of Africa. There are numerous sly references to other books and films, from Moby-Dick to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Okay, the acting wasn't top-notch (not even Connery, who didn't seem to be enjoying himself much), but the visuals were great (especially the Nautilus) and the plot was pall-mall. Not Shakespeare, but not bad.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A TALE OF TWO ARTHURS!"></head><body><p>THE FILM:<br />"King Arthur" is a superbly-crafted historical epic. Mixing the Athurian legends with historical fact, the film, for the most part, succeeds at presenting a plausible "truth" behind the origins of King Arthur (mixing the acts of Ambrosius the Roman from the fifth century, the name of Artorius Castus and his Sarmatian Knights from the third century, and the battle of Badon Hill from the sixth century). The battle scenes are exciting, the acting top notch. Any fan of historical epics, and for those who want to see the possible origins of the Arthurian legend, then you won't want to miss "King Arthur!"<br />THE DVD'S:<br />"King Arthur" is available as either the theatrical version (fullframe format), and as the "Unrated Director's Cut" (2.35 Widescreen format). The extended version features some great new footage (A conversation between young Arthur and Palagius, a conversation between Lancelot and Guenivere) that should have been left in to begin with. It is also more graphic than the theatrical version, which makes the film feel more realistic.<br />Both DVD's come with some great extras, and are presented with fantastic picture and sound. Whether you are getting the theatrical version or the director's cut, prepare for a great movie experience! Movie/DVD Grade: A+</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The formula remains the same; but it&#65533;s still impressive"></head><body><p>Huge amounts of dramatic situations, of which we all know the outcome; a foe that is much stronger than humankind; impossible scientific considerations; separated groups of people stranded, and trying to reach each other. We have seen this before, haven't we? Yes, but who cares? I don't. <p>Before heading for the theater, the viewer HAS to know what "The day after tomorrow" is about: a movie based on a completely absurd premise, with stunning, thrilling scenes (jaws hanging) portraying the fury of the nature - something we all, morbidly, enjoy watching, as long as it doesn't happen in our own backyards. Hurricanes, floods, the sea like a wall, heading towards New York, people freezing instantly. That's what you'll see in this movie. If you are the kind of people who keeps saying "But that is impossible!", do yourself a favor and don't go watch it. Stay at home, tuned to the Discovery Channel, or National Geographic Channel, where you are presented actual facts. "The day after tomorrow" is an exercise in fantasy, where Roland Emmerich imagines what would happen if the world would suddenly turns colder. <p>In fact, the horrific parts of the movie are presented when Dennis Quaid is on screen. Unfortunately, completely lame acting from my childhood hero from "Inner space". On the other hand, Jake Gyllehaal and Emmy Rossum (the pretty girl from "Mystic river") both do a good job. And it's good to see Sela Ward is still beautiful and a competent actress. <p>But the best part of the movie (at least to me) is that my country will be only a little bit chiller, and its external debt will be pardoned by the IMF. I can't wait for the new Ice Age to come.<p>Grade 8.0/10</p></body></html>

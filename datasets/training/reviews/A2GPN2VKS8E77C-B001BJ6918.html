<meta name="summary" content="This Movie Kicks A---!! Plenty Of Action and Snappy Dialogue"></head><body><p>I won't bother reviewing "Kill Bill Voume 1" because Quentin Tarentino ("Reservoir Dogs," "Pulp Fiction" and "Jackie Brown") originally intended this to be one big movie. Therefore, I will rate it as a whole. The action scenes were well-choreographed and the dialogue, said to be Tarentino's strongest point, is snappy. Lucy Liu ("Charlie's Angels," "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle", etc), Vivica A. Fox ("Independence Day," "Two Can Play That Game), Daryl Hannah ("A Walk To Remember," "Silver City", etc), Michael Madsen and David Carradine play the DiVAS (Deadly Viper Assassination Squad) of whom The Bride (aka Black Mamba) (Uma Thurman, in a knockout role) was once queen bee and whom Bill (Carradine, scary as hell) has ordered to be executed at her wedding...really. She wakes up four years later, plotting bloody revenge...and she gets it: "A roaring rampage of revenge. I roared, I rampaged and I got bloody satisfaction." This movie is one of the best films that feature chicks kicking a-- and a whole lot of action. Special features include a performance by the 5, 6, 7, 8's (who appear in the film), a deleted scene (without Tarantino's commentary, for some reason) and more. The DTS 5.1 Surround Sound lets you get the full impact of this martial-arts homage. The mix of blaxploitation tracks (which includes a track from "Zamfir: Master Of The Pan Flute") and Robert Rodriguez' (the "SPY KIDS" movies) own score is awesome. Rated PG-13 for bloody violence, language and brief drug use.</p></body></html>

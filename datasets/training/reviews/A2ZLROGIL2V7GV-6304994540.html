If you're looking for a movie with a meaning or a solid and concrete plot, this may be something to skip.  If you're looking for an out-of-control and outrageous comedy with memorable characters and some of the funniest lines ever to be spoken in film, &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is something that is definitely worth checking out.<p>The story revolves around a man by the name of Lebowski; actually, he prefers to be called &quot;The Dude.&quot;  A couple of thugs mistake him for a different Lebowski and ruin his most prized rug that really tied the room together.  Well, The Dude isn't going to stand for that kind of &quot;unchecked aggression&quot; (even if he is one of the laziest human beings on the planet).  When he tries to get the other Lebowski to compensate him for his ruined rug, well... let's just say things get very complicated.  And his psychopathic bowling buddy, Walter (who is also a Viet Nam Veteran), doesn't make things any better when he tries to help The Dude with his problems.  But hey, everything's gotta work out in the end, right?  He's The Dude!  He is the man... or at least he better hope so, for his sake.<p>This is one of my favorite comedies.  Although it is almost impossible for me to do the film justice by reviewing it, I have to because it is a movie that I love and watch on a daily basis.  The dialogue and characters are so entertaining and fun to watch that it is almost impossible not to become captivated by the film.  Jeff Bridges is amazing as The Dude and takes his role to the limit.  John Goodman gives his best performance ever and really steals the show for the majority of the film.  Even though he's only in the movie for a short amount of time, John Turturro is HILARIOUS in his two scenes.  The movie is brilliantly written and directed.  The Coen Brothers have made another gem; that much is for sure.<p>Be warned, this is no kiddy movie.  If you get easily offended by movies with foul language, STAY CLEAR FROM THIS MOVIE!!  Every other word in the movie is the f-word, and in fact, according to the IMDb, the f-word appears in the movie 267 times.  So please, take that under consideration.  As foul as this movie is, I think it's necessary and works perfectly for the movie.  It makes the characters what they are.  If you've ever seen the watered-down &quot;TV version&quot; of the movie, you'll know that it quickly loses its spark and appeal that was so well-established in the regular version.  The language is a necessity in this kind of environment, so it's better to avoid the movie if that's going to upset or offend you.<p>The DVD doesn't have a lot to offer, so I'm hoping that one of these days a fully-loaded special edition will come out.  Until then, this is what we're stuck with.  The picture and sound quality really shines in this movie.  You can watch the movie in widescreen or standard format.  Special features included are cast/crew information, a teaser trailer, and a 30 minute interview with the Coen Brothers.<p>&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is a comedy to remember, although it's not a movie for everyone.  It's not a movie to watch if you're looking for something solid or with a standard formula to it.  The film is a wildly unpredictable journey into the unknown.  The film really does a great job of standing out from the other &quot;predictable&quot; and &quot;flat&quot; comedies that we are plagued with.  A five-star movie all the way.</p></body></html>

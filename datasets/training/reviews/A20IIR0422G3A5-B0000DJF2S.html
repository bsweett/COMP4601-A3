<meta name="summary" content="A High tech 19th century waste of time."></head><body><p>`The Society of Extraordinary Gentlemen' is quite simply a comic book movie done almost exclusively to revel in special effects excesses. Virtually the only useful thing I got from this DVD is the fact that Sean Connery was offered and turned down parts in both `The Matrix' and `The Lord of the Rings'. I hope Sir Sean is regretting the fact that he gave up the chance to play Gandalf in the hands down most successful fantasy movie series of all time!<br /><br />Since I am recommending you not bother buying this clunker, I will review the premise.<br /><br />The story gathers together seven major fictional character from 19th century novels. Specifically, there is:<br /><br />Alan Quatermain (Connery's character) from H. Rider Haggert's novels.<br /><br />Captain Nemo from Jules Verne's novels, especially '20 Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'.<br /><br />Dorian Gray from Oscar Wilde's `The Picture of Dorian Gray'<br /><br />Dr. Jekyl / Mr. Hyde from Robert Lewis Stevenson's `Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde'.<br /><br />The Invisible Man from H. G. Wells `The Invisible Man'.<br /><br />Tom Sawyer from Mark Twain's `Tom Sawyer' and `Huckleberry Finn'<br /><br />Minna Harker from Bram Stoker's `Dracula'<br /><br />The cast is made even more improbable by casting Dr. Hyde as the perp of Edgar Allen Poe's `Murders in the Rue Morgue'.<br /><br />The immediate and most obvious anomoly here is the absence of the singularly most useful character, Sherlock Holmes, or at least his even more shadowy brother, Mycroft Holmes. The value of Quatermain, Nemo, and the invisible man are fairly easy to take in a CIA wet work type of operation, but the appropriateness of the other characters are a real stretch. Except for the displacement of about 100 years, this story is basicly something straight out of `The Fantastic Four' or the `X-Men', except that the X-men movies were much, much better than this clunker. Like a similar movie, `Van Helsing', the whole affair is nothing more than to execute a special effects tour de force, with practically no other good coming from the exercize.<br /><br />This fantasy may have been just a bit easier to take, if it were not for the truly great fantasies done recently such as `The Lord of the Rings', `The Narnia Chronicles', and the Matrix trilogy.<br /><br />Save your money!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Fine But Not Perfect Version"></head><body><p>This movie marks the first time I've seen a Harry Potter film after reading the book.  As a result, I was curious how I'd like it.  I found the book long and repetitive, but I still couldn't see how they'd cut 850 pages down to a decent film.  While there were some cuts I didn't like, for the most part they pulled it off.<br /><br />Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is back.  Or at least that's what Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) claim.  But the Ministry of Magic is denying these claims and the "Daily Prophet" is backing them up.<br /><br />As if that weren't bad enough, the Ministry has appointed the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) is going to teach the subject by textbook only.  There will be no practical part of the course.<br /><br />Harry and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are kept out of much of what is happening in the fight against Voldemort.  They know that Dumbledore has resurrected the Order of the Phoenix to fight the dark lord again, but they aren't allowed to join.  Yet Voldemort seems to be trying to communicate something to Harry.  What does he want?  Is Harry in danger?<br /><br />One thing that helped this movie was the art of the montage.  They used that several times to cut out the repetition from the book.  They also cut out a couple sub-plots, one I really loved, and some of the funny scenes from the book.  It was disappointing, but I could see the need to make room for important things.<br /><br />Still with all those cuts, they also cut out most of the Order of the Phoenix scenes.  What is there is great, and fans of the character Tonks especially won't be disappointed with what they see during her too short screen time.  And the ending was rushed, taking away the emotional impact while still covering all the important details.<br /><br />The only change that really bothered me was one near the middle that changed a character.  I know they had to cut out some characters, but the resulting damage to this remaining charater one really bothered me.<br /><br />If all this talk concerns you because you haven't read the books, don't let it.  I saw it with a friend who hasn't read any of the books, and he followed everything perfectly.<br /><br />But enough of my picking apart the plot.  What about the rest of the film?  As we've come to expect, the visuals are stunning.  And the cast does a great job as always.  Special praise goes to Evanna Lynch as new student Luna Lovegood and Imelda Staunton as Umbridge.  They both captured their characters from the book perfectly.<br /><br />As with the last film, this one is rather dark and scary, especially at the end.  Be sure to consider that when deciding whether to let your kids watch.<br /><br />No, it's not the book.  But until we get a long miniseries version, this is certainly a fine way to enjoy the story.</p></body></html>

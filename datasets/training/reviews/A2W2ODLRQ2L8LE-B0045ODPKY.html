<meta name="summary" content="Salt is a Sweet Movie"></head><body><p>When a story is written about a double agent, a mole or a sleeper agent, any number of cards can play. As a result, the suspence and tension levels immediately go up qute a few notches.<br /><br />This movie is about Evelyn Salt (Jolie); and to a much lesser extent her husband, who is German and studies spiders.<br /><br />The story starts 2 years ago in Korea where Salt is being tortured, from there it is fast forwarded to where she meets a soviet agent, who is trying to activate her.<br /><br />Apparently, Salt's father was a powerful wrestler and her mother a chessmaster. Hence she has inherited her fighting skills and strategic capabilities from them.<br /><br />In this film, Salt is more resourceful than MacGyver, can escape lockdowns better than David Copperfield and can jump moving vehicles better than Morpheus (in Matrix 2). That being said, you can expect to be treated to a lot of high speed chases, gut wrenching escapes, and several tight plot twists.<br /><br />This film is guaranteed to have you riveted to your seat from start to finish. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very good..........BUT...."></head><body><p>A well thought out little horror story with a great look for the budget and timeframe in which it was shot.......... the only negative drawback ?<br /><br />The 2 actors.<br /><br />Whenever the movie reaches a point where the terror/tension is reaching a peak, the 2 actors come across as comical and humorous instead of scared and terrified.<br />One gets the impression the 2 main actors kept laughing while doing the most horrifying scenes and the director/editor had to finally give up and splice together the scenes where they seemed to be cracking up the least.<br /><br />My wife for example kept asking me.... "Do you think they wanted this to be dark humor or something ?"<br />I replied "No.. the actors are trying to act extremely terrified, they just can't pull it off and come across like they are doing a spoof"<br /><br />If you overlook those acting ability limitations...the whole film as a package is well done.<br /><br />At least I stayed awake thru this film unlike the horribly boring and overated "GRUDGE", which I have no idea how anybody finds interesting.</p></body></html>

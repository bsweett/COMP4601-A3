Any deviations he made from his book must be okay because he allowed it to happen.<br /><br />In the original, Gene Wilder, captured the eccentricity of Willy Wonka with a bit of warmth and whimsy.  Johnny Depp captured Wonka's eccentricity in typical cooky Tim Burton fashion.  While Wilder's Wonka was no big fan of the four naughty brats, he was never mean to them, even when they learned their lessons the hard way.  The worthy child left standing would make himself known.  Depp's Wonka seemed as if he designed to elminate the ones he didn't like. That just bugged me. A man wanting to keep his vision alive with the right child shouldn't seem so hasty to produce a winner.<br /><br />Another flaw of the new version are the kids that were cast.  One exception is the role of Charlie.  I actually prefer Freddie Highmore.  The brats in the new movie were weaker versions of their original counterparts.  Varuca Salt is my favorite.  She truly was a loud, impatient and indignant spoiled brat.  The newer Varuca Salt didn't seem that bratty at all.  I mean, a band named themselves after her.  They wouldn't do so if she wasn't so memorable.  Even worse were the parents's reactions to their naughty children's mischeviousness.  In the original, the parents actually freaked out as concerned parents would.  In the newer version, the parents just idly watched, mouth agape, barely uttering a word as if they were just going with the flow.<br /><br />Boat scene in the new version:  LAME!  The original was far more memorable. It's the scene we all think of when we you mention "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory".<br /><br />Oompa Loompas in the original and their songs...better.  Enough said.<br /><br />Finally, what was the point of the flashbacks to Wonka's childhood?  Completely unncessary.<br /><br />Despite all that, the film exhibited true Tim Burton style and aesthetics. If it was only for those reasons, then the new version would have been a great film.  Otherwise, if you want the dreamy tale of a kid, a chocolatier and his factory, stick to the original.</p></body></html>

This is a little bit better than "The Curse Of The Black Pearl" (2003). Johnny Depp is back and excellent as Captain Jack Sparrow, the role that garnered him an Oscar nomination! Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley as back as well as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. Gore Verbinski's (he also directed "Curse Of The Black Pearl") directing is excellent! The story & screenplay by Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio (both who wrote "Curse Of The Black Pearl"), and also based on characters created by Elliott, Rossio, Stuart Beattie & Jay Wolpert, is excellent! The music by Hans Zimmer (who also did the music to "The Da Vinci Code" (2006) & was a music programmer, score & soundtrack producer to "Curse Of The Black Pearl") is excellent! The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski (who also did the cinematography to "Curse Of The Black Pearl" (2003) is excellent. The film editing by Stephen E. Rivkin & Craig Wood (both who did the film editing to "Curse Of The Black Pearl" (2003) is excellent. The casting by Denise Chamian & Priscilla John is excellent. The production design by Rick Heinrichs (who won the Oscar for his work on "Sleepy Hollow" (1999) & and was also a set designer on "Edward Scissorhands" (1990), both which were directed by Tim Burton and starred Depp) is excellent! The art direction by John Dexter is excellent! The set decoration by Cheryl Carasik is excellent! The costume design by Liz Dann & Penny Rose (both who did the costume design to "Curse Of The Black Pearl" (2003) is excellent! Everyone that worked on this film will return to do the third film, "At World's End" (2007) which is slated for released May 25, 2007, on a Friday, just like this one. This is an excellent film that keeps you entertained and intrigued.</p></body></html>

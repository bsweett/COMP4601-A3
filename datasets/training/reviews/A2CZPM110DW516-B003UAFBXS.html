<meta name="summary" content="The King and JFK VS The Mummy"></head><body><p>Watching "Bubba Ho Tep" only days before the anniversary of Elvis Presley's death proved to be a better way to honor the King than viewing one of his own mostly mediocre movies.<br /><br />Written and directed by Don Coscarelli, "Bubba Ho Tep" takes place at the Shady Rest retirement home in Mud Creek, Texas where a 3,000 year old mummy is sucking the souls out of the aged residents. Where does the King of Rock and Roll fit in to that scenario?<br /><br />It seems those tabloid headlines are true: Elvis didn't die on that muggy summer day in 1977. Weary of fame, he traded places with one of his better impersonators. It was the impersonator who died, and since the contract the real Elvis signed with his replacement was destroyed in a fire during a barbecue at the trailer park where the King was residing, there was no way back into his old life. After his hip goes out during a performance ("I was gyratin', takin' care of business"), he ends up at the Shady Rest where no one believes him when he says he's Elvis, certainly not Ella Joyce's condescending nurse.<br /><br />But one resident does believe him. Why wouldn't he? "John F. Kennedy" is the victim of equally bizarre circumstances. He is also presumed dead, but it turns out his 1963 assassination was staged, and the president's skin dyed black to keep the truth from coming to the surface.<br /><br />Elvis is skeptical, but, hey, why not accept what "Jack" says, especially since "JFK" is the only one hip to what's happenin' at the rest home? Together these two now aged and slow moving icons battle the mummy.<br /><br />"Bubba Ho Tep" is frequently hilarious, yet it never mocks Elvis or JFK. It treats both of these giants with reverence, and when it comes to the King, Coscarelli and star Bruce Campbell show real insight into Presley's life and career. As Elvis flips through channels on the TV set, he stumbles upon a marathon of his own movies and laments that none of them were any good. "Colonel Parker was a shark and a fool," he says, "and I was a bigger fool for following him." The need to compensate for the mistakes he made in his career gives Elvis the push he needs to risk all and take on the mummy.<br /><br />Coscarelli and his cast beat all the odds by making this deranged nonsense work. Campbell is exceptional as Elvis, and Ossie Davis makes for a very dignified JFK.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks</p></body></html>

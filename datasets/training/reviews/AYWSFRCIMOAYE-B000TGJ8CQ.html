I kept asking myself "What's happening next?". I could not guess it. It might also because I have never read the story that this picture was based on. That turned out to be a good thing. I enjoyed it.<br /><br />The ending is the biggest surprise. I've never seen any thing like that. The most illogical thing about this script is Nicolas was able to see things only 2 minutes before they happenned. Some people said that's not enough time to act on them in reality. But I can ignore that.<br /><br />I wish the film had explored the relationship between Nicolas and Jessica more. That way, it would have became a suspense and love story.<br /><br />Anyway, it's still one of the best films I've seen so far this year.</p></body></html>

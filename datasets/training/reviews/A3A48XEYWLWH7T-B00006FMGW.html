<meta name="summary" content="Light hearted Ripley"></head><body><p>Sunday, February 13, 2005 / 3 of 5 / Light hearted Ripley<br /><br />Tom Hanks chases after Leo DiCaprio in the late 60's as `teen' Leo impersonates an airline pilot, doctor, lawyer, etc.  I never felt deeply involved with the characters or the story, it was pretty superficial and not particularly compelling.  It was an effective time waster though, Hanks gives an understated and tired performance as the chaser.  Plays a bit like the Talented Mr. Ripley without the psychopathic baggage.</p></body></html>

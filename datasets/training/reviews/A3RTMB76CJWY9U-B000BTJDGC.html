Now, ask yourself: were there *any* scenes out of a courtroom from the film's trailer? Any shots of the defense attorney (who is the main character)? Why didn't they want to be upfront about the film? Why did they want it to seem like it was a supernatural thriller a la Stigmata?<br /><br />I don't know, because it's a pretty good courtroom drama, and made more interesting by having an element of horror about it, an element of the supernatural. However, at heart, this is a movie about whether or not those things *could* exist, and respecting those people who believe it, and not primarily a movie about demons trying to kill people. It's a movie about the role that faith plays in our lives.<br /><br />All that said, the horror-elements are well-done. My fiancee jumped five or six times during the film. :) Its horror is mainly found in suspense; not a lot actually *happens* other than Emily Rose looking evil and twisted at the camera, but it's still effective and the exorcism scene is excellent and powerful.<br /><br />It claims to be based on a true story. I don't know the details of that true story, or how close this movie gets to it, but I can believe that something like this could happen. This is more of a philosophical piece than a modern horror flick (it has nothing in common with, say, Saw or Scream), but I'm here to tell you--that's not necessarily a bad thing. There's room for Saws and Screams, and room for this movie, too. It's only unfortunate that the film's creators didn't think it would sell as well, if they were straight-forward as to what it's actually about.<br /><br />Bottom line: this movie is thought-provoking, interesting and entertaining. Four stars.</p></body></html>

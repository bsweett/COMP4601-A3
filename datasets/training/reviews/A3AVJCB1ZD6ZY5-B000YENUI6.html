<meta name="summary" content="Strong film--character study features contrast between compassion and dispassion"></head><body><p>Just five days short of Christmas, a girl child is born.  As she takes her first breath, midwife Anne (Watts) is calling the time of death of her teenage mother, Tatiana, who bears injection bruises on her slender arms.<br /><br />Perhaps it's the recent loss of her own child from a former lover, the time of year, or just her character in general, but Anne is deeply touched by the situation and vows to find the baby, who she's named Christina, a family and a decent life instead of institutionalized foster care. So she steps over the line and takes the mother's personal effects--a diary which is written in Russian.<br /><br />Despite being warned not to dig any deeper by her Uncle Stepan, a recent Russian emigre and former KGB agent (Skolimowski) and her English mother (Sinead Cusack), she goes to the one place where she has a clue in English--a Russian restaurant called the Trans Siberian.<br /><br />There she meets three men:  Semyon (Mueller-Stahl), an older Russian who appears at first as a strong but benevolent father figure whose Borscht is almost identical to what Anne's own father used to make. Kirill (Cassel) a drunken and somewhat overdramatic heir to the throne and Nikolai (Mortenson) the very dispassionate driver for Kirill, who he's sworn a brotherly allegiance to.<br /><br />At first, Semyon denies knowing anything about the mother of the deceased young woman, but his interest piques when Anne tells him there's a diary.  He offers to translate the diary and find the child's family for her.  Anne at first demurs, suspecting Semyon is Vory v Zakone (Russian mob) but he's very persuasive and she agrees to return the next night.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Kirill, the family enforcer and Semyon's only son, has declared war on a rival Chechin gang by killing one of the members who has disparaged his character. The man is dispatched and disposed of with machinelike precision that's almost more frightening than any violence the film  depicts.<br /><br />Anne's and Kirill's actions set into play a chain of events where we witness violence and betrayal at every turn. Throughout the current action, Tatiana's voice (Sarah Labrosse) quietly relates the contents her diary to us, detailing first hope, then rape and prostitution while being forced to take drugs every day.<br /><br />Director David Cronenberg definitely upped the ante as far as violence and that violence is depicted with a clarity and realism that few films today can match.<br /><br />While many focus on the violence, what's most interesting about this film is the character study. Mueller-Stahl's depiction of Semyon is the best 'Godfather' I have seen to date and is in my opinion well worth a supporting actor  Oscar. His switch from a loving family man to someone who'd betray a member for another will keep you riveted in your seat.<br /><br />Both Anne and Nikolai cross the line in different ways and seeing how the two individually act and interact with each other is one of the best parts of the film.  Anne doesn't hold back what she feels while Nikolai plays his cards very close to the vest, but can surprise you too.<br /><br />Viggo Mortenson, who I will always reign as Aragorn in my mind, was also amazing.  According to the press on "Promises", he spent weeks in Russia traveling without a translator so he could perfect his Russian and his knowledge of the culture that made Nikolai. The man will always have 'stars' as far as I am concerned.</p></body></html>

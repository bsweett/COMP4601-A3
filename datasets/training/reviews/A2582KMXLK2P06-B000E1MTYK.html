<meta name="summary" content="oh poor Harry"></head><body><p>For the first time ever, I was NOT entertained by a Harry Potter movie.  Something was seriously wrong with the entire thing.  I remember the happy look on my face when I found out that HBO would be airing Goblet of Fire in late November.  I waited patiently for the new Harry Potter film like a snake in the grass.  Just the magical atmosphere of the previous three Potter movies made me want to crave another one, and crave it BADLY.  Turns out I was surprisingly disappointed with it.<br /><br />I hated that the first 45 minutes really didn't do much in the way of keeping my interest.  I thought that whole portion of the film was pointless.  It was like they were trying to recapture the mysterious atmosphere from Chamber of Secrets, but not so interesting the second time because we've already seen it before, and done MUCH better then.<br /><br />Another crappy part of the plotline- Harry Potter goes to dancing class with his friends.  I'm not kidding.  Why would anyone find this interesting?  It was a waste of time.  To make matters worse, a fairly lengthy amount of time was devoted to it.  Just silly.<br /><br />Look, I LOVED the previous three Harry Potter movies, but this one just didn't do anything for me.  It was like the writers have finally run out of ideas, and the feeling I got was that the only reason this movie exists is to either make more money, or, probably more realistically, the writers wanted to give hardcore Potter fans more storyline and top-notch production to cheer about.  Hey, I can't blame them for that.<br /><br />Harry Potter fans love the books and the movies.  We know this from experience by the way people stand outside at midnight waiting for either the new book to be released or the new movie to be shown. So if the fans are happy with this film, good for them.  I sure wasn't.  To me, Goblet of Fire had a "been there, done that" vibe, and I simply can't look at it any other way, unfortunately.<br /><br />To sum up this disappointing film- a few interesting action scenes (one exciting memorable scene in particular was Harry challenging a giant flying bird thing- sorry, I don't know what you're supposed to call the darn creature) in between a LOT of unnecessary dialogue that apparently is only interesting if you happen to be a REALLY big Harry Potter fan.  For the people out there reading who just *enjoy* the Potter films but aren't obsessed- stick with the previous three.<br /><br />(updated thoughts- January 2, 2007)-<br /><br />Okay, watching the movie a second time (which seems to be necessary, I apologize) I actually really like the movie after all.  I give it a rating of 4 out of 5.  The segments I originally thought dragged, were actually pretty good.  They WERE telling a good story here after all, it just wasn't obvious I guess.  The action scenes were pretty spectacular as well.  Harry Potter is just getting older and becoming an adult, that's probably why I hated it at first.  I didn't really care for the whole dancing plot in the middle of the movie (which was about 15 boring minutes long) but that's the only serious complaint.</p></body></html>

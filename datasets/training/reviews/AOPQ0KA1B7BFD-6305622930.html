<meta name="summary" content="Blu-ray review for the non-purist"></head><body><p>I have probably watched the movie Patton at least twenty times, if not more.  I've seen theatrical, VHS, DVD, and now Blu-ray versions.<br /><br />The original film presentation in the theater, on VHS, DVD, and my old CRT TV was muted, grainy, and diffuse.  It is the image quality I distinctly picture in my mind for the movie.  The Blu-ray transfer though was anything BUT muted, grainy, and diffuse.  Regardless how the images have been scrubbed, the movie looks as if it was shot yesterday.  The images are sharp, clear, and bright.  At times the colors on the closeups are a bit too saturated, but not so much to be distracting unless you are a film purist.  When I popped the BD in the player to show my non-purist friends the Blu-ray version, without exceptions their only word was "wow," quickly followed by "how'd they do that?"  I thoroughly enjoyed the Blu-ray version of the film and count it as one of the showpieces of my HD library.<br /><br />The DTS surround sound is acceptable, a nice rendition from a time when surround sound was not the standard.  If you are a film purist, don't buy the Blu-ray.  If you merely enjoy clear, sharp images that give a familiar favorite a newly painted look, like a restored antique, buy the Blu-ray version.  You'll feel like you're watching the movie again for the first time.</p></body></html>

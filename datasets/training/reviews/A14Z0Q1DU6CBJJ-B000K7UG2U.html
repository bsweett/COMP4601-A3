The original Manchurian Candidate that starred Frank Sinatra, Angela Landsbury (who won an oscar) and Laurence Harvey was a superior film and DIDN'T REALLY NEED A REMAKE.<br /><br />Yet, somehow, they managed to get me there. Strangely enough, when the movie started, I found myself there. Enjoying it. Into it. Wondering what was going on.<br /><br />There are some quality moments of UNEASINESS. Frightening scenes. Meryl Streep did an outstanding job filling Angela Landsbury's shoes. A terrible person. Not to mention, the movie did a fantastic job of portraying the realism in cutthroat, no mercy, do anything to win election poltics.<br /><br />But then, the movie dropped right off the planet for me.<br /><br />Everything was fine until, in order to get to the finishing point of the movie, two characters made decisions, based on conscious thought while under a hypnosis that couldn't be previously broken.<br /><br />A worthy attempt at a remake of a immortalized classic, dropped right into the trash can with a very very very convenient and poorly thought out finale.</p></body></html>

As it was, I really savoured this wonderful comic drama.<br /><br />The story concerns a would-be-novelist and wine connoisseur, divorced and depressed, dissatisfied as a high-school English teacher, and struggling financially. It's his best friend's wedding, and the two of them take off into Californian wine country for a last bit of fun together.<br /><br />This central relationship is beautifully portrayed. The two are poles apart on every level, having in common only the fact they shared a room together in college, and yet they share a strong bond that goes deep.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti's performance as Miles is the backbone of the film. You're always wondering what he's thinking, and even though for a long time you're unsure whether you even really *like* him, he immediately garners our sympathy, because his pain shows through in so many ways. He invests the character with all kinds of nuances.<br /><br />Having praised Giammati's performance, let's not underrate his support. His scenes with Virginia Madsen are particularly poignant. The porch scene, in which the script gets heavily into wine-as-metaphor-for-life territory, could have been disastrously pretentious, but it works because of two perfect performances and because it is obvious the characters are aware of what's going on - she's trying to communicate with something deep inside Miles, while he's trying to fasten his seatbelt and avoid getting close. Their deep connection, her warm heart and his hurt are so evident.<br /><br />Other delights in the film are the Californian landscape and Guy Rolfe's quirky, jazzy score. Payne is a great storyteller, and throws in lots of neat devices to tell us more about the characters and the story without having to hit us in the face with the script all the time.</p></body></html>

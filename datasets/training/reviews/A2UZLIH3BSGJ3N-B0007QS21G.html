<meta name="summary" content="Predictable,Pathetic disaster flic"></head><body><p>All I can say about this movie is if you want to test out how good your home theater system is and show off for you friends and neighbors,this film will do it.However,if you looking for a film with just the slightest bit of substance, it falls far short.<br /><br /> This one goes up amongst the worst of the 2004 summer films,and with the many other horribly made "BIG BUDGET" Hollywood films.The plot was your basic formula-one Hollywood disaster film.The were so many CGI effects in this movie,nothing seemed or looked real.The only time I was at least excited about this movie was when multiple tornados were ripping though Los Angeles destroying it.<br /><br /> The storyline was beyond pathetic.Weather scientist/super genius work-A-holic dad who neglecs genius like teenage son who in turn goes through cliche-like growing pains.Pararents are cluesless to family problems,horible catastrophic events are predicted by genius father,and he gets a big,"I told ya so" throughout the rest of the film.<br /><br /> Then there is the world wide spread panic&everyone running around like their heads got chopped.The storyline has to throw in the teenage love interest,he nearly dies,and girl of his dreams saves him,then she nearly dies&teenage boys risk life&limb to save her.Father risks himself&puts himself in harms way to save son&find would be surviors.The cliches are endless,and the badly written script,not only makes what good actors there were in this film look bad,you are guaranteed to drop a few I.Q points just watching this movie.<br /><br /> Ebert&Roeper plastered their "Thumbs Up" approval on the front cover of this film.My question is,where where they cramming their thumbs?I swear Ebert's review skills have depleted next to zero since the untimely departure of Gene Siskle.Roger Ebert,its time to retire,and Roeper...you need your head examined,and you need a different job,because you suck at the one have now.If you have any brains,you will not buy this dvd,or vhs...renting it is a big enough insult.If you paid money to see this film in the theater this summer,I can only take pitty&feel sorrry for you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="My favorite Tarantino...and one of my favorite films"></head><body><p>All you have to do is watch Quentin Tarantino talk in an interview to know that, besides he is &quot;a fanboy of his own movies&quot; (as a friend of mine once said), his knowledge of film surpasses any video guide on the bookshelf. And through his first movie he shows his interest has been put to good use - we have not only a good script and great acting, but basically a great movie!<br /><br /> Tarantino's narrative owes much to Stanley Kubrick's &quot;The Killing.&quot; (As well as Akira Kurosawa's &quot;Rashamon&quot; and D.W. Griffith's &quot;Intolerance&quot;) Like &quot;The Killing,&quot; the story is of a group of men committing a great caper, and the different parts mix-matched to heighten a sense of mystery and suspense. The story is told in different &quot;segments&quot; highlighting the principle characters. Tarantino did the same thing with his later films &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; &quot;Jackie Brown,&quot; and even &quot;Kill Bill,&quot; so here we see him working his technique into a professional method. It works quite well - yes, I agree, the characters are all scumbags and save for Mr. Orange probably have no real redeeming qualities about them, but it is because they are so fascinating as personalities that we enjoy watching their stories.<br /><br /> The characters and dialogue are extremely memorable, and you will never forget them. (whether you want to or not) The most popular one is of course Mr. Blonde quipping, &quot;Are you gonna bark all day little doggie, or are you gonna bite?&quot; but there is a plethora of others - to quote them, I would have to break Amazon's 1,000 words or less rule. As I said the characters are all fascinating in their own right (even Mr. Blue has a great line regarding what waitresses have to do for a tip!) and upon more than one viewing you start to see them in different lights. Sure, maybe Mr. Pink really is a sissy (and I use that word to avoid trouble with Amazon censors) but when you look at the film closely...he IS the only one that acts like a professional!<br /><br /> The DVD itself is great. Besides some select-scene commentaries, it has a DVD with the film in a formatted version (for all you anti-widescreen people) and another DVD with the film in letterbox. It also has the three different scenes of the infamous ear cutting sequence. Although the opening credits warn you that the cut-scene is graphically violent, I thought the close-up of the ear cutting was more corny than violent - you can tell it's a fake ear. The other cut-scenes include a long sequence that details more of Mr. White's backstory, as well as more minutes of Eddie arguing with Mr. White and Mr. Pink. The picture quality and sound on the video is outstanding - overall, it's a worthy DVD for this movie.<br /><br /> Admittingly, this movie is not for all tastes. It has an R rating for a reason, but if you can stand violence and the f-bomb and just appreciate it as a movie I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed.</p></body></html>

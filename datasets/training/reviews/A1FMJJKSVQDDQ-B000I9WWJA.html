<meta name="summary" content="Incredible director and actors; the rest of the film . . . meh"></head><body><p>The really good thing about Spike Lee's "Inside Man" is the ensemble of brilliant actors. Denzel Washington is a detective who has an odd choice of fashion and an issue with marriage. Clive Owen is the head of a team of robbers who has something else in mind other than money. Jodie Foster is an antagonistic broker who can easily talk down her victims. Christopher Plummer is the Chairman of the Board of Directors who is willing to keep a secret that's hidden in his own bank. Chiwetel Ejiofor is Denzel's partner in crime who is always willing to be a part of the action. These and many other actors give spectacular performances.<br /><br />But as the film features a great ensemble of actors, the film itself fails to impress. Aside from the shockingly powerful conflicts involving racism and corruption, the plot involving the heist and the overthrow of a government official is something that's already been seen before. If you've seen "Dog Day Afternoon" or have read Nelson DeMille's "Cathedral," then you'll notice that the story in "Inside Man" is nothing really special. Another problem with this film is the uneven third act. With all the hell that's been going on in the last two acts, this final segment contains a much slower pace, which really becomes very tiresome when the last few minutes of the film finally approaches. And speaking of the ending, the last fifteen minutes features two twist endings. But somehow they weren't very shocking. I said to myself, "that was unexpected," but at the same time I said, "but why don't I feel as shocked as I'm supposed to be?" I guess I've seen too many twist endings in recent movies that are kind of like these two, and maybe that's why I'm not surprised at all. But I do believe that the biggest problem with this film is that the jumpy timeline. Once we're in the middle of the bank heist, we start to see some brief scenes that are set in an interrogation room (I won't spoil it for you by telling you exactly which people are inside it). This really spoils the tension and the atmosphere as we already seem to know how this will all end.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. Spike Lee is an intelligent director, and all of the actors give great performances that no doubt stick out in this movie. However, the script and the overall climax and resolution don't really work. I still prefer the film "Dog Day Afternoon" (bank heist) and the novel "Cathedral" (political corruption and hostage situation).</p></body></html>

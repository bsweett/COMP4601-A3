<meta name="summary" content="Things get even more serious for Harry"></head><body><p>Harry Potter has known for years that Lord Voldemort wants to destroy him, but in this episode the knowledge comes home in a very personal way.  When Hogwarts is chosen as the site of the Triwizard Tournament and hosts teams from two other wizard schools, students under the age of 17 are specifically forbidden from entering their names in the competition--but somehow Harry's name ends up in the running, and what's more he's accepted.  This causes considerable tension and partisanship among Hogwarts students and leads to a serious break between Harry and his buddy Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), which is only worsened by their realization that Hermione (Emma Thompson) isn't just a grindy girl any longer.  That, in turn, leads to trouble with fellow competitor and Qudditch star Viktor Krum (Stanilav Ianevski), and to a triangle involving Harry, Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and competitor Fleur Delacour (Clemence Poesy).  In the end Harry learns just how--and by whom--the draw was rigged and must face Voldemort on a more dangerous footing than ever before.<br /><br />Given the length of the original book, a good deal unfortunately gets left out of the movie.  One of the high points, for example, is the Quiddith World Cup sequence, which is far too short (the impression I got is that the games are never even finished before Voldemort's Death Eaters put in an appearance).  Meanwhile a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, the former Auror "Mad-Eye" Moody (brendan Gleeson), arrives at Hogwarts, and two former prisoners at Azkaban, Igor Karkaroff (Pedja Bjelac) and Barty Crouch, Jr. (David Tennant), play vital parts.  Harry also discovers how unpleasant publicity can be when Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson), the aptly-named (she's both pestiferous and persistent) Daily Prophet reporter who has come to Hogwarts to cover the "human-interest" aspect of the games, turns out to be a gossipmonger and a distorter of everything that's said to her.  This is also the literal midpoint of the series and the place where it begins to turn much darker and scarier, foreshadowing the tests and trials still to come.  As has been pointed out before, kids who started reading the Potter books or watching the films when they first appeared should be old enough to handle everything, but the youngest ones, who don't have the advantage of growing into Harry's adventures along with him, may need a year or two before they can do as well.</p></body></html>

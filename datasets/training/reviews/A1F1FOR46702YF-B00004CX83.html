In the dark streets of Gotham City, an urban myth known as "the Batman" (Michael Keaton) uses the night to strike fear in the hearts of criminals. When the city is threatened by the psychotic criminal known as the Joker (Jack Nicholson), the mysterious Batman becomes the city's only hope. "Batman" is an outstanding action-packed spectacle that honors Bob Kane's popular creation. Director Tim Burton's unique style gives the story much emotion and depth. Michael Keaton gives a fine performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne and Jack Nicholson is terrific as the Joker. The movie also contains some nice visuals, impressive action, great humor, cool gadgets and a rich music score. The cast also includes Kim Basinger, Robert Wuhl, Michael Gough, Billy Dee Williams and Jack Palance. This comic book film became the runaway smash hit in 1989 and launched a multimillion dollar franchise.<br /><br />For fans whom been waiting years for a special edition release, "Batman" Special Edition really delivers.

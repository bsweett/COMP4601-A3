<meta name="summary" content="Spectacle and excitement in powerhouse sequel"></head><body><p>X2<br /><br />(USA - 2003)<br /><br />Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)<br />Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS<br /><br />Following an attempt on the US President's life by what appears to be a rogue mutant (Alan Cumming), the school for 'gifted youngsters' established by Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is raided by military factions opposed to the integration of mutants into American society. The X-Men are subsequently forced into a collaboration with their mortal enemy Magneto (Ian McKellen) to clear their names and destroy an all-powerful threat from humankind...<br /><br />Opening with a scene-setting quote from Abraham Lincoln, followed by one of the most astonishing action set-pieces of recent years (underscored by the 'Dies Irae' from Mozart's 'Requiem'), and closing with an extended confrontation between Good and Evil that tops anything in the original X-MEN (2000), Bryan Singer's powerhouse sequel ups the ante in terms of spectacle and excitement, whilst simultaneously expanding and developing the radical subtext (a minority group forced to take a stand against prejudice) inherent in the original Marvel comic strip.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed, and performed with gusto by a dedicated cast (including Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen and Brian Cox, relegating Patrick Stewart, James Marsden and Anna Paquin to secondary roles this time out), the narrative unfolds with bold precision, constantly surprising the audience with inventive visuals and heartfelt emotional drama (the mutant 'coming out' scene - played with knowing irony by young Shawn Ashmore - will resonate especially with gay viewers). Also, this is one of the few movies in recent years to use the Super 35 format in a defiantly cinematic manner, with none of the concessions to television which usually characterizes this 'fake' widescreen process.<br /><br />Followed by X-MEN: THE LAST STAND (2006).</p></body></html>

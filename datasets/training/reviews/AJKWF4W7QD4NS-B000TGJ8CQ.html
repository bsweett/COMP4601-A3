Now and then, you'll get genre classics like Blade Runner, A Scanner Darkly, and to a lesser extent Total Recall.  Other times, you'll get Paycheck.  Next falls somewhere in between, with Nicolas Cage starring as Cris Johnson: a two-bit Vegas magician who can see two minutes into the future.  Using this ability to get by via gambling, Cris soon learns that a government agent (Julianne Moore) is after him to use him to track down terrorists and a stolen weapon, but all Cris has on his mind is a mysterious woman (Jessica Biel) whom he keeps seeing visions of.  Next does get off to a great start with some inventive storytelling that actually manages to echo Dick's "The Golden Man" story of which the film is based, but it sadly veers into a pretty predictable, glossy action yarn that doesn't suit the talents of the otherwise solid director Lee Tamahori (Die Another Day).  The villains (featuring the talented Thomas Kretschmann) get no depth at all, nor do many of the other characters besides Cris, and the film's ending will just leave you infuriated.  Still, Cage is actually pretty good, and Biel is surprisingly good as well, but neither can manage to save this flick.  All in all, Next is a disappointment in terms of being a fan of Philip K. Dick tales, and as a stand-alone sci-fi/actioner, just doesn't offer enough to keep you interested.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Freaky"></head><body><p>I have come to rather enjoy Johnny Depp movies, for both their overall sense of weirdness, but also their originality. "Secret Window" is quite a good addition to Depp's range of films.<br /><br />As the blocked up writer, Mort Rainey, Depp portrays the semi-wasted, bad-hair-day, couch potato well. I would say that Depp has made an artform out of looking like the cat dragged him through the hedge backwards. His acting, in contrast, is very good, and he carries the intensity well.<br /><br />John Turturro, whom I always associated mostly with Adam Sandler comedies, comes across as a very freaky John Shooter, who accuses Rainey of stealing his story. Turturro really surprised me with the way that his posture, facial expressions and drawling accent carried a sense of forboding across. And that hat was just a nice touch.<br /><br />Without throwing in spoilers to the plot, I found this film to be excellent in most aspects. Some of the production was a little bit sloppy, (I noticed two mistakes in continuity, one which was with that hat that I loved so much). It did not detract from the movie that much, and the movie had a good level of nerves in it.<br /><br />After hearing some negative comments on it, I found "Secret Window" to be a great movie, with a good story. I enjoyed it....a lot.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="For Better or Worse, It's All About Marshall"></head><body><p>As publicity-focused biopics go, 8 Mile is one of the better-executed examples. Although it's self-serving at times, this is also an impressively open and honest take on Eminem's roots and the self-imposed blockade of excuses he laid out for himself before catching so much as a whiff of stardom. The plot outside of Mr. Marshall Mathers is fairly simplistic and limited, though, with most of the cast simply orbiting the star and reacting to his angry, frustrated outbursts. I found the battle raps to be as intense and exciting as a good action scene, and the choice to limit them to a few key moments was a smart move that doubled their importance. Eminem himself is startlingly good in the lead role; it may not too much of a stretch to play yourself in the cinematic story of your own rise to fame, but I've certainly seen plenty try and fail. Authentic, street-smart inspiration that offers a fresh take on a tired old tale.</p></body></html>

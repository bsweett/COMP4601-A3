<meta name="summary" content="awesome.ive seen the first one about 100 times."></head><body><p>the story is about michael j fox who hangs out with a mad scientist named doc brown.doc brown has ivnvented a time machine from a delorian.thats a really bad ass car.whenever it goes 90,it travels time to its programmed destination in time.it runs on plutonium.the terrorists doc stole it from come back and waste him.marty runs in the car.yep you guessed it.he goes over 90 and gets zapped back to his hometown only 30 years earlier in 1955.i know what youre thinking.no future?no ancient china?or what about.............this isnt bill and ted.its based in science.when marty pushes his future father out of the way of a speeding car,his mom falls for him instead of his dad like she was supposed to.if he cant hook those two up,hell never exist in the future!well,they figure it out and the doc goes to the future.thats part 1.in part 2,the doc comes back and takes marty to the future about 30 years.he must stop himself from making a decision that totaly screws up his entire families future.on the way he gets a hold of a sports almanac with every sports result since god only knows when in it.biff-his dads long time rival,steals it and goes back in time to the 50s and gives himself the book.by 1985 he rules the area and is rich beyond belief.so now they must travel back to the 50s and steal the book back.they figure it out.in part 3,the doc goes to the old west.he leaves the car in a cave and sends a letter to marty in his time.marty uses the car to visit the doc in the cowboy days.the doc screws with the space time continuim again.they end up sending marty back alone.the car is destroyed by a train.kids love it.there is however some smoking,drinking,making out in cars,"parking" and mild language.so maybe teen kids.this is the trilogy.the first part is a classic.#2 is also great.#3 leaves a little to be desired but is good too.part one is in the 50s.part 2 is in the future.part 3 is in the old west.its much better than a lot of time travel movies because it uses the space time continuim theory in which even the smallest  and seemingly minute of details could cause really crazy things to happen.this movie is crazy obsessive over patterns.the same things happen over and over in many different ways.its weird to have explained to you,but is very funny and entertaining to watch.they didnt get to be in the top selling movies ever by not being loved by the masses.hes got an ok girlfriend you dont see so much and his mom looks way better.especialy in part 2 after biff forces her too undergo a massive boob job.biff and all his buddies are very annoying.the doc and michael j fox both give great performances.the message here is:think about the future!this is the 2 stars' 2nd,3rd and 4th best films.doc plays in a better movie called one flew over the cuckoos nest ten years earlier.michael j fox had a better movie with mars attacks!the special effects are pretty cool.there wont be anymore in the trilogy.its in the top 10 best movie sets with at least 3 ever!</p></body></html>

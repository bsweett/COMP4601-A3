<meta name="summary" content="Powerful acting...but NOT a horror film.  Don't be misled!!!"></head><body><p>Ashley Judd gives the most fearless performance of her career, and Michael Shannon (a solid character actor) gives an equally powerful performance.  Right there, the movie is worth seeing.<br /><br />BUT...I must admit the previews for the movie were all pretty misleading.  They make you think you'll be seeing a grimy little horror story, dealing with a bug infestation of some sort.  THIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE...at least not in the traditional sense.<br /><br />It is a story about one lonely woman's descent into utter madness...led there by a man who is already quite insane himself.  It is a psychological horror story of the first-order...but it does not deal at all with anything supernatural, sci-fi, alien invasion, killer viruses, etc. etc.  If that's what you're expecting...then you'll be a one-star reviewer just like half the reviews on this site.<br /><br />The movie is based on a stage play, and it is talky.  Most of it takes place in Judd's cheap little hotel room that she has been living in for months or years.  This makes the movie feel a little "stage bound" but it also helps make Judd's world seem sad, lonely and pathetic.  Hopeless, even.  She has escaped a bad marriage...but one day, her ex-con ex-husband comes "home" and assumes he will just take up residence in her life again.  The hubby (Harry Connick Jr....devoid of any charm) also is clearly ready to start up his abusive ways again.<br /><br />We learn that this couple has also experienced a major personal tragedy...which explains the utter despair that has clearly helped hold Judd back from moving on with her life.<br /><br />Suddenly, into her life comes a strange, and strangely compelling, young man (Shannon) who despite his oddity and somewhat anti-social behavior, takes a shine to Judd and also helps to fend off the unwanted husband.  The two embark on a tentative affair that grows into a clingy relationship that grows into a madness that both share...one that grows ever larger because the two feed off and encourage each other.<br /><br />I don't want to say much about the nature of the madness...but suffice it to say that what the movie shows is that Judd is in a perfect psychological state to turn herself over completely to the delusions of another...to forget her real life and absorb the probably imaginary life of a person who actually has brought her some tiny measure of safety, comfort and intimacy.<br /><br />The acting feels a little "stagey" at times...almost over the top.  In fact, Shannon played his role on stage, and I suspect had a hard time turning his intensity down a notch.  So, Judd simply stepped up to the plate and matched his intensity.  She is tough, yet extremely vulnerable.  Closed off yet willing to give her heart and soul in exchange for very little.  Also, Judd brings pretty much no ego to the film...she looks haggard.  True, she is one of the more natural beauties in film (and yes, she even does a nude scene)...but her allure is more carnal, more base, more driven by need.<br /><br />The ending of the movie is quite shocking, a bit sad, and in many ways disappointing.  It happens abruptly, and when we realize that it's over, we might want to throw something at the TV.  But part of that stems from the fact that while these characters are far removed from anyone we know (hopefully!)...they have been built carefully and convincingly...and we eagerly hope for a different fate for them.<br /><br />This is not a film for everyone.  It isn't exactly an "art film" and it isn't a "genre film."  I think it can suit a viewer whose tastes are wide ranging and who appreciates good performances, even in a script that is a bit stagey and a bit contrived.  It has something to say about the power of loneliness to make us do unattractive things.  It is NOT designed to scare you, creep you out or even make you feel you've had a good time.  It wants to rattle you a bit...and it succeeds.  It is just hugely unfortunate that the films marketing was so misleading.</p></body></html>

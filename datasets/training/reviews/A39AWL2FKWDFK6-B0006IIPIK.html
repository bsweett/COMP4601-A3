<meta name="summary" content="Computer graphic wizardry"></head><body><p>"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is essentially a comic book in a movie format with a stupendous array of computer graphics but a somewhat thin plot.<br /><br />The movie begins with an awesome graphic of the dirigible Hindenburg docking atop the Empire State Building in a snowstorm in the 1930's.  A German scientist and sole survivor of a group of scientists involved in secret experiment after WW I in Berlin is a passenger.  He has some information to divulge and calls to meet with New York Chronicle reporter Polly Perkins, played nicely by the deco garbed Gwyneth Paltrow.  Soon after they meet the city is attacked by gigantic flying robots apparently searching for some generators located there.  Sky Captain Joe Sullivan played dashingly by Jude Law is summoned to save the day and damsel in distress Paltrow.<br /><br />Law is the leader of a mercenary air force and is aided by his second in command, mechanical genius Dex Dearborn played by the talented, entertaining and flaky Giovanni Ribisi.  Soon Law and Paltrow collaborate to solve the plot which involves the usual goal of world destruction.  They had learned that a brilliant German scientist Dr. Totenkopf, played by a computer generated Laurence Olivier, the creator of the secret experiment is behind the annihilation of the Earth with his army of robots.  Their investigation leads them to far reaching exotic worldwide locations.<br /><br />"Sky Captain" is an entertaining romp but it's never fully explained as to the motivation of Totenkopf to destroy the world.  The acting was decent with Paltrow and Ribisi leading the way.  Angelina Jolie playing Captain Franky Cook was ridiculous with her phony English accent and eye patch and added little to the plot.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ugh"></head><body><p>Am I the only one who was really bored with this film.  It had a wonderful cast, and a really interesting time travel/dual reality story.  I just thought the execution was terrible.  They tried to market it as a horror, but it certainly was not.  I'm not sure what I would classify this as.  I didn't feel scared, or wonder, or even a great interest in the characters overall.</p></body></html>

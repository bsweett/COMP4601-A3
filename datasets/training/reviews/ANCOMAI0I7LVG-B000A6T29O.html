Sadly, the film cannot capture the tension and unexpected excitement that spills over your game controller every time you play the video game.  Thankfully, this film is not as thankless as the sequel, but it rarely makes a real impact.  I didn't expect that at all.  Seeing Angelina Jolie all reared and ready to go as this classic video game vixen, I really expected more out of the whole thing, but instead I got a marginally entertaining action flick with an uninhabited lead actress who didn't seem to connect with this character at all.  She seemed disengaged, which is a shame because on paper this works gloriously.  The plot is a shamble, but that is to be expected (I mean, it's not like the video game was too concerned about being plausible) but the tense engagement a person feels while sifting through clues on their own to `solve the puzzles' is lost in this unimaginative rendering of the prose.  Instead, we get a film that feels generic in texture and certainly less inspired than the cultural phenomenon that the video game became.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The director of The Exorcist William Friedkin in top form.  Nitey Nite don't let the bed bugs bite."></head><body><p>Bug is a paranoid and tense story of a couples dissension into madness.  I would say it is similar to Roman Polanski's Repulsion where we experience what the person is seeing and going through.  Ashley Judd gives her most vulnerable and powerful performance to date as Agnes White, a down on her luck bar waitress living in a Oklahoma Motel located off a highway.  She is tormented by phone calls from her abusive ex husband Jerry who just got paroled played effectively by Harry Connick Jr. Connick Jr plays Jerry as both witty, charismatic, and almost likable and also an intimidating abusive bully.  So, you can see where Judd's character would fall for him and also why she would hate and be afraid of him.<br /><br />One night after work a friend and co worker stops by to visit her and party a bit, she brings a guy she met recently by the name of Peter Evans played by Michael Shannon and yet again another great performance.  Peter takes a friendly liking to Judd's character and she to him, they are both very lonely and in need of companionship and are able to become very open and close in a short period of time.  Peter is an ex military vet that apparently went a.w.o.l because of experiments being done to him using his body as a guinea pig and infecting him with a contagion.  Peter believes they have infected him with some sort of bug and after an intimate night together between him and Judd they find bugs in the bed and so begins Peter's downward spiral into this horrific delusion of madness as he takes her with him.<br /><br />I found this to be a unique, interesting, and different story of madness with great performances all around.</p></body></html>

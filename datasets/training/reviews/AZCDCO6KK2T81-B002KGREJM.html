<meta name="summary" content="The Last King of Scotland Rules!"></head><body><p>I was overjoyed to see one of my favorite and underappreciated actors, Forest Whitaker, win Best Actor for this film as it rare for African-American actors to get juicy complex roles like this one.  This film is nothing less than riveting from beginning to end.  ALL actors absolutely shine in this film, including a wonderfully and surprisingly understated performance by the nearly unrecognizable Gillian Anderson (Scully on X-Files) as a Britsh missionary.  The writing is tight with no scenes or dialogue as "filler."  In addtion, the direction is crisp and confident.<br /><br />While the historical background is fairly accurate, the story itself is fiction and was done to provide a means for the audience to get a supposedly "inside" look to this horrific, yet charming dictator and on that level and with those intentions this film succeeds.  Some of the specific brutality we see in this film (hanging people by hooks and dismemberment) committed by Gen. Amin is fictionalized so that we get an impression of the real crimes he committed against his own people.  This is admittedly exercising artistic license, but it's handled well and, I think, appropriately.<br /><br />This is a haunting film that you soon won't forget experiencing and I do mean it's an experience.</p></body></html>

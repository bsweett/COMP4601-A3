Thrill to his sidekick's simian exploits!! Witness Chris Carter calling his lawyer!!<br /><br />Trying to be fair. Trying to be fair. But I guess I'm sipping a bit from a bottle of hater-ade right now. Firstly, by no means is this a terrible film, not with Spielberg at the helm. Any other picture, and I may even think it a four star film. But the Indiana Jones franchise should be held to a much higher standard. Only, I guess George Lucas wasn't satisfied with mucking up the Star Wars universe. Dude looked around, gazed at his belly button, and then arrived at the big epiphany: "Hey! Indiana Jones and space aliens!!" Spielberg and Ford should've flung him off a cliffhanger. INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL just goes to prove that it's better to strike when the iron's hot. Did it really take this long to come up with a working storyline? And then this is the best that could be worked out? I am hugely bumming right now. This fourth entry effectively takes away from the luster of the Indiana Jones franchise. STAR WARS EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE and STAR TREK V: THE FINAL FRONTIER are snickering at THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL. They might even be pointing fingers.<br /><br />It's been 19 years since INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE. With Harrison Ford now in his mid-60s, it's unrealistic that the film would have him still gallivanting in the World War II era, fighting Nazis. Truth is, I was actually looking forward to seeing our favorite archaeologist in a 1950s backdrop, which is more age-appropriate to him. The film touches on that decade's nervous tropes - the McCarthy paranoia, the fear of the atom bomb, the Cold War... And for villains, Indy gets the KGB, which is a fine institution for nefariousness, except that these guys aren't as classic or as contemptible as the Nazis; so, right there, something is diminished. On the other hand, the film does capture that vintage 1950s look. There's a fun scene in which Indy instigates a rumble at a vintage diner (to the tune of "Shake, Rattle and Roll") and then motors thru the college campus.<br /><br />It was George Lucas who came up with introducing a 1950s sci-fi B-movie element into the storyline, even though you can tell in the bonus features that Spielberg wasn't too enthused about it. But, moving on, there's always a fun pulp adventure element in the Find-the-Relic game in which Indy so often finds himself playing. The McGuffin here happens to be an ancient crystal skull, the return of which artifact to the fabled city of Akator (a.k.a. El Dorado) will, if the legends are true, grant unimaginable power to its bearer. So it's another race against time around the globe, with Indy this time going up against the psychic female KGB agent, Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett, who is having fun).<br /><br />It sucks that Sean Connery insisted on staying retired, rather than reprising his role as Indy's dad. But at least Karen Black returns as the always feisty Marion Ravenwood, so there's still something of the familiar in this new continuity. Decades later, Marion and Indy still have unresolved issues. Shia Labeouf enters the franchise as the scowling, leather jacket sporting, hair-greased-back biker Mutt Williams -and I didn't like him much. There's a revelation about him later on which fails to stun anyone. Ray Winstone is here, as well, as Indy's untrustworthy ally, and John Hurt also, as a demented professor.<br /><br />Harrison Ford, despite the creakiness, only lets up a little with the action sequences, and reportedly, he performed a fair bit of his own stunts. Even in his dotage, Indy can still take infinite amounts of punishment. There's still very much a sense of those 1930s cliffhanger serials in this film. The movie starts out with a nifty set piece in a musty, gigantic military warehouse in Nevada, with Indy held at gunpoint and instructed to seek out a stowed-away relic. Longtime fans will recognize this warehouse, of course, and there's even a fond nod to the Ark. It's pretty cool, also, the clever manner in which Indy tracks down that relic. And when the guns start blazing, Indy demonstrates that he's still pretty spry for a sexagenarian, knocking heads and swinging thru the air with his trusty bullwhip. This extended sequence culminates with Indy silhoutted against a nuclear mushroom cloud. A pretty cool image.<br /><br />I used to think that THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL was a dumb title, until I heard the other ones being passed around (INDIANA JONES AND THE SAUCER MEN and INDIANA JONES AND THE ATTACK OF THE GIANT ANTS). One writer for the film, joking around, actually came out with my favorite, INDIANA JONES AND THE SON OF INDIANA JONES. Ah, well. There's bits of humor scattered throughout, including a very funny revisiting of Indy's ophiophobia. The action sequences are predictably dynamite stuff, with plenty of cliffhanger moments, that is, until they're undermined by a dose of silly buggers. One such is introduced in the elaborate Jungle Chase Which Takes Forever, which features Mutt precariously dueling with the KGB villainess on speeding vehicles and then swinging vine to vine with CG-created monkeys, at which point I threw up my own imaginary fedora in disgust. Also offputting is the tonal shift from occult in past films to sci-fi in this one. So, just when I thought I was done nitpicking, not only is the climax somewhat reminiscent of NATIONAL TREASURE 2, but its trite X-Files overtones has the film officially jumping the shark for me. George Lucas tried to hedge it, stating that, nuh-uh, these creatures weren't at all extraterrestrials, but, rather, interdimensional beings... who just happened to look like aliens. Ooookay.<br /><br />Two discs in this package. Disc one has the feature film, as well as two special features: "The Return of A Legend" (17 minutes long) and a pre-production segment (12 minutes). On Disc 2: an in-depth six-chaptered Production Diary (around 79 minutes, and you get your money's worth); "Warrior Makeup" - a segment about the extensive makeup process for the keloid-decorated jungle warriors and the mud warriors (5 minutes); the legend of "The Crystal Skulls" is explored and also how the production crew manufactures their likeness (10 minutes); "Iconic Props" - concerning the props used in the film (10 minutes); "The Effects of Indy" covers the CG f/x and the model work done, including the desert test town that gets blown up (22 minutes); "Adventures in Post-Production" covers Ben Burtt's sound design and John William's scoring of the film (12 minutes); "Closing: Team Indy" is a shout-out to the film crew's principals (3 minutes); Pre-Visualization Sequences - pre-vis is a rough animated storytelling device which, in this case, preps the crew for 3 action sequences (the Area 51 get-away, the jungle chase, and the ant attack; totalling 14 minutes); 5 galleries and 2 trailers; and a game demo of LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures, XBOX 360.<br /><br />There's a sense of trying too hard in this picture. I got the sense also that it was trying really hard to sell Mutt Williams to the audience, to the point where I felt threatened for the Indy character. So, while I'm so glad to see Indy still very much doing his thing, this movie leaves me feeling robbed. It's good that John Williams' theme song is along to make things feel more canon. I, for one, wouldn't mind another Indiana Jones film, if only so that Indy could bow out on a higher note. Harrison Ford may be past his prime as an action hero but, for his age, he still carries himself well, so another adventure is still do-able. But if Ford wants to retire Indy, then I hope the movie studio isn't contemplating plonking a fedora on Shia LaBoeuf's noggin and handing him a bullwhip. Because there will be an uprising.</p></body></html>

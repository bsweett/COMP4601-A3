Just as there's a reason there are different races born out of one blood we may one day experience mutations to our DNA that we can yet even begin to fathom.  <p>O.K. Forget about all that a let's just talk about the film which to me started out like gang busters and then lost some of it's intensity as the film progressed.  The premise of the story laid a great foundation but I felt there could have been both greater character development or additional plot twists that would have made the movie more interesting.  In short it seemed a little bit too predictable.<p>The film is very enjoyable anyway.  The effects are great and the acting is noteworthy.  Particularly Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart.<p>So check it out just don't expect too much from the story.  I hope that if they do a sequel that it'll be better than the original.</p></body></html>

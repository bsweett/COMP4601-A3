When they crash land on a strange planet, however, they find out that the evolutionary system is backwards...with apes evolving from men!<br /><br />The hallmark of this movie is that it can be so serious within its ridiculous parameters.  I mean, I think that even most die-hard "Apes" fans will admit that the presentation of the different types of simians in this film is utterly hilarious (from the walks all the way down to the facial expressions).  If you are a person with no imagination, you would be rolling in the aisles, so to speak.<br /><br />As such, the fact that this movie contains such pertinent political/social satiric themes with such a crazy "Apes" backdrop is truly the epitome of science fiction.  Some people like their film drama in real-life, some like the Old West, and others like fantasy or cartoon worlds (along with countless other genres).  If you prefer your drama to be of the thinking variety and with shades of science built in, than this is the movie for you.<br /><br />I also won't ruin the ending for the one guy living under a rock who hasn't already heard (!), but suffice it to say that the ending provides the perfect explanation on such a social-satire type of film.<br /><br />Thus, I consider "Planet of the Apes" to be one of my favorite films of all-time.  It takes some imagination to enjoy, for sure, but if you can open your mind to a little craziness you'll be prone to understanding the film's simple, yet bitingly accurate, social themes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="SURPRISINGLY GOOD FILM  ...from a great game!"></head><body><p>RESIDENT EVIL was a great Capcom videogame (with many successful versions) with a very simple plot: someone must do something in order to solve a mystery. In this basic outline, the character must cross many different spaces (each has its obstacles) and accomplish smaller missions, that help him to gather objects that lead to peaces of information leading to a final confrontation. Period.<p>The good thing is that the adaptation for Cinema of that basic game structure is reasonably well made. The result is this: a group of top-soldiers is sent inside a secret corporate lab complex where a lethal virus has been spread. They have a few hours to a) discover what happened, b) disable and neutralize the virus and c) get out.<p>Like the game, the complications rearrange the order of priorities and the journey is constantly being redesigned according to the new obstacles found. Like the game, some characters have secret agendas and everything leads to the high-powered action confrontation scene.<p>Put like this, it all seems cerebral, but don't missunderstand me: the film is very entertaining! If the story/screenplay design is (in this case) simple, it is because film is not for the cinemateque. It is pure (and good!) fun. It has a lot of rhythm, the cast is appealing, the characters are fine (in their game-like dimension) and the action makes you jump.<p>Even if you do not play the game (or even know nothing about it) you will understand it perfectly for the screenplay was designed for a wider audience. In this sense, the film is constructed so you'll get early on all the information that you need for the rest of the film. <p>I liked it very much and I believe this to be the best game-to-film adaptation ever made. It works even for those who did not play the game and it delivers a simple plot with lots of interesting twists and great action scenes.<p>The ending is begging for a sequel (but you know that already) and - I have to admit - it is a great ending (and it alone worths the whole film!). Great art direction (doesn't have much to do with the game). Good soundtrack.<p>The extras are fine and they're mostly on the technical side (why wouldn't they be?). Milla Jovovich is absolutely beautiful. Despite the fact that we are dealing here with game characters, I do think that Milla gives a great performance. Furthermore, I do think she is capable of taking higher flights in the future. Aside of that, she is someone the camera trully loves.<p>See it and have fun!</p></body></html>

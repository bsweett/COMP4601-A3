<meta name="summary" content="Sexual politics under the drab clouds of London"></head><body><p>Half way through watching Mike Nichol's new film, Closer, I wondered why the straights were getting so hysterical about sexual infidelity; after all, what's the big deal about? Couldn't they have all worked out some sort of arrangement that kept all parties happy? Surely the four of them would have been a lot happier if they'd just accept that none of them were particularly happy with monogamy and moved on from there.  But of course, if this were the case, we probably wouldn't have a movie, and the four actors - who do a fine job - also wouldn't have had the opportunity to stretch their acting chops.  Closer portrays characters that are so embittered, and that have become so mired in sexual politics that their hurt is intense, and their life pain interminable.  Ultimately, the strength of the film lies not so much in the story - which at times borders on the farcical - but in the four excellent performances of the four leads - Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Clive Owen, and Julia Roberts.<br /><br />With the objective eye of a camera, the film focuses on the chance meeting of four disparate people as they meet by chance and swiftly proceed to launch into a series of unstable relationships, where the atmosphere becomes steadily toxic. Alice (a ravishing Natalie Portman) is a transplanted American and a stripper, who at the opening of the movie, is ambling along a crowded sidewalk. Walking toward her is Dan (Jude Law), a newspaper obituary writer with literary aspirations. Their eyes lock across an intersection, into which Alice steps. But she accidentally looks in the wrong direction and a taxicab knocks her down. Dan saves her and they soon become physically involved. The story then jumps to Dan's friendship with Anna (Julia Roberts), a rather cynical photographer. Anna is attracted to Dan but she has a chance meeting with Larry (a dynamic, sex obsessed Clive Owen) that leads to a deep emotional involvement.  But Anna loves Dan, and Dan loves Anna - Dan is also ambivalent about his relationship with Alice. The four who have collided by accident, are continually subverted by one another, and by their own feelings.<br /><br />The movie leaps across the months, and even years to bring the chronological study of their lives to the viewer, and often it is only a single line of dialogue which gives any indication of how much time has passed. Individual scenes are indeed thrilling in their unfettered, bracing, and constant venom. There's a wonderfully tense scene where Larry, full of pent-up hurt and sexual frustration, discovers Alice at his local strip club, and proceeds to verbally seduce her, and another scene involving a nasty spat when Larry finds out that Anna has been unfaithful - the scene is full of vitriolic and verbal raunchiness. This verbal intercourse is vigorous, compulsive, sometimes painful and occasionally funny.<br /><br />The actors are all terrific but the standout is Clive Owen's magnificent Neanderthal physicality, combined with his unadulteratingly and unrelenting hidden seediness. Natalie Portman shines, as a sexy, abused victim, who uses her feminine attributes to her advantage. Filmed against the grey, rain socked urban London winter; the movie is gorgeous to look at - the bleak weather being a metaphor for the isolation of the characters souls. The human animal is nothing but a craven, sex-obsessed, selfish creature, which unadulteratingly seeks to satisfy his own sexual, emotional, and spiritual desires, without regard for anyone else. There's no doubt that Closer is smart, adult, and sophisticated, but it lacks a lasting reverberation, and most viewers will probably be left wondering what the fuss was all about in the first place.

<meta name="summary" content="Bad Taste"></head><body><p>This is an uneven movie. It almost works. The atmosphere and music are intriguing and adequate, some moments are visually stunning and a few thrills truly engage and surprise. However, the rythm of the narrative is too slow and the plot is basically just another cat-and-mouse game with an anticlimatic ending that`s way too out there and doesn`t connect with the rest of the movie. Anthony Hopkins is again a convincing Hannibal Lecter but Julliane Moore plays an uninteresting, bland Clarice Starling that shows little sparkle. There are some genuine moments of tension and suspense to find here, though as a whole it`s too flawed and not very captivating. The baroque feel is an edgy and well-accomplished idea, creating some tension, darkness and weirdness that unfortunately don`t work very well in the end. This movie wants to be a rich banquet, yet ultimately is just another happy meal. Tasty enough, but leaves you wantig more.</p></body></html>

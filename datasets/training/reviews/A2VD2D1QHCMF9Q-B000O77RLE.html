<meta name="summary" content="It would have been better without attempts at political correctness."></head><body><p>This is the first movie that I have ever seen about WWII from the Japanese point of view.  The severe discipline, crossing the line to arbitrary cruelty, was apparent in the leaders.  The humanity of the ordinary Japanese soldier was contrasted to their superiors.<br /><br />Not all peoples act the same, although this movie tried to show ambivalence on the part of some American soldiers.  American cruelty in WWII was not comparable to that of any other soldiers and any attempt to show the contrary is just wrong.  Our fighters were no angels, but they did not display anything like the inhumanity shown by one patrolman on the streets of his home town, nor would our soldiers demand wholesale suicide when things take a turn south.<br /><br />A good movie but it would have been better without attempts at political correctness.</p></body></html>

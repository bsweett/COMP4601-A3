<meta name="summary" content="Eli Roth made a Holocaust film."></head><body><p>I bought the Hostel 2 dvd after watching Hostel 1 several times on cable.  Despite his youthfulness, Eli Roth really delivered, he put the audience in the shoes of the Nazi targets. He's making Holocaust movies which is why Germany deleted the scene with the gypsy kids in Hostel 2.  Eli Roth is WHY Michael Haneke made Funny Games!!! Ho, ho, ho, Green Giant. I really do HEART Eli Roth.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Solid Action Thriller"></head><body><p>Bruce Willis is Jeff Talley, a former LA cop who specialized in hostage negotiation.  As the film opens Talley refuses to set the sharpshooter take out a man who is holding his own family hostage.  Talley tries to talk him out but the man kills his wife and young son and then kills himself.  So immediately the viewer is manipulated into felling sorry for Talley.  A year later, the stress has evidently got to him and he has moved his own family to the small California town oif Bristo Camino, to become the town Sheriff.<br /><br />Trying to escape the big city problems, Talley soon finds heimself caught up in a a dual hostage situation, including his own wife and daughter.  When three local hoods follow a SUV back to a lavish home in the hills, the trio break into the home to steal the car.  The home is owned Walter Smith (Kevin Pollack) who seems to be a bit of a shady business man.  Smith is home with his teenage daughter Jennifer, and young son Tommy.<br /><br />Now Smith has the most elaborate security system complete with alarms, surveillance cameras, front gate...the whole nine yards and yet the three hoods, brothers Dennis and Kevin Kelly and their sinister partner Mars, just hop the fence and get into the house.  I had a little problem with their so easily bypassying the security systems.  little Tommy manages to trip a silent alarm and soon a local female cop resonds to the alarm and is shot by Mars.  This of course brings out all the local cops and nearby county sheriffs to help.<br /><br />Now comes the sub-plot.  Seems Smith has a DVD that some very nasty men want to get their hands on.  They kidnap Talley's wife and daughter and order him to take charge of the situation and get them the DVD or his family will be killed.  Talley now has to contend with not only these organized pros, but the jumpy young hoodlums in the house.<br /><br />Willis is his usual enjoyable self.  He doesn't play quite the super-heroic type he did in the Die Hard films.  The best performance, hands down goes to Ben Foster who played the menacing, violent, and self-destructive Mars, who had an almost child-like fascination with death.  Jimmy Bennett as Tommy is yet another young kid who seems to have a touch of kevin McCallister in him as he continually manages to outsmart the bad guys by using a series of air ducts and secret ceiling doors to move about the house and even make phone calls out to the police.  He's probably just a little too smart.<br /><br />In the end, not enough is explained about the mysterious men who are after the DVD and what exactly is on it.  I was waiting for a payoff that never really materialized.  Still there was enough good stuff in the movie to make it worth a look.</p></body></html>

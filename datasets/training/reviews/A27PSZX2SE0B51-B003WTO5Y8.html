<meta name="summary" content="Killer Flick"></head><body><p>The same declaration I made in my review of David Fincher's &quot;Seven&quot; applies here: I am a sucker for serial killer movies.  And what we've got here is the alpha and omega of serial killer movies, for it features not one but two distinctly drawn killers.  Each is terrifying in his own way, and the film's fascinating narrative device calls for one to help the FBI track down the other.  Also, like &quot;Seven&quot;, most of the violence occurs off camera, allowing the audience to conceive of a far greater image of terror than any camera can capture.<p>We all know Hannibal Lecter, don't we?  Anthony Hopkins does a masterful job of creating one of my all-time favourite movie characters.  He is a curious mixture of charisma, grace, style, fierce intelligence, and wickedness, brought together with a series of fascinating and terrifying mannerisms.  Given all the hoopla surrounding Hopkins' performance, you'd think Hannibal was in every scene.  He is actually in relatively few.  Still, he easily manages to dominate the film.<p>Jodie Foster, on the other hand, is in almost every scene.  At one time I thought her performance as FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling was much less successful.  Sure, she managed to hold her own in the scenes with Hopkins, but I always thought her stilted and inconsistent.  With each viewing, though, I realize that that is precisely the point.  Throw yourself into a similar situation and see how controlled and composed you are.  Foster suggests the right amount of macho bravura and timidness (a tough chore for sure).  And her wandering accent, I now realize, subtly conveys much information about the character's personal history.<p>These two actors shine most in their scenes together.  Lecter, training his laser-like psychiatrist's eye on Starling's every weakness from behind the glass in his maximum-security prison cell.  She does her best to defend against his probing, while trying to extract some information for herself.  When one interview ended, I couldn't wait for the next one to begin.  The supporting actors, who would normally blend into the background when confronted by two titanic leads, all acquit themselves well.  The standouts are Scott Glenn as Clarice's FBI superior, and Ted Levine as the aforementioned &quot;other&quot; serial killer. <p>The rest of the movie has a lot to live up to in those Lecter-Starling scenes.  Thankfully, it does.  Thomas Harris' novel and Ted Tally's script deliver a story full of suspense and interest.  'Buffalo Bill' has kidnapped the Governor's daughter, and the authorities realize they only have a few days to rescue her.  What should amount to a cliched premise is heightened by Bill's unique obsessive fetish.  It is revealed slowly, and thus manages the rare feat of rewarding subsequent viewings.  Jonathan Demme's controlled and stylish directing never lets things get out of hand or too over the top, as is the danger in movies of this genre.  And he allows himself to set up several spectacular set pieces; visual delights that at once thrill and frighten you (I'm thinking specifically of one aftermath tableaux that utilizes melodramatic lighting, music, and Christ-like imagery to great effect).  All these elements combine to create a magnum opus that all the participants will be hard-pressed to equal.</p></body></html>

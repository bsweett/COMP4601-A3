It's more of an amusement park ride than a movie, and a lot like those modern roller coasters that are fast, comfortable, and amusing -- never dangerous or shocking.<br /><br />So, enjoy the Thing stopping an 18-wheeler, the Human Torch taking a guided missile on a race across the city, Jessica Alba in modest underwear, and a geeky Reed Richards slipping his hand under a door.  It's a summer diversion like a fat marshmallow squished between two grahams and slathered in melted Hershey's chocolate.</p></body></html>

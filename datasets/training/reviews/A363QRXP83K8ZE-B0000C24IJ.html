<meta name="summary" content="Greetings from West Virginia--Wish You Were Here!"></head><body><p>Once again, I find myself liking the fact that straightforward horror films are being produced with a nod to fans, and lamenting the fact that all they can offer is countless references to better films of yore.  On the one hand, Wrong Turn is touted as a "70s style horror film" (according to the director in the featurettes and commentary) so it's to the point, introducing the cast and then killing them.  On the other hand, this isn't the 70s, movie audiences are savvier and more jaded, and you need some kind of original element and/or post reflexive sense to pull this off in the post-Scream era.  <p>Wrong Turn resembles one large part Texas Chainsaw Massacre, one part Deliverance, and one part Predator, baked in a Friday the 13th 'Dead Teenagers in the Woods' pie crust.  The cast looks smart, but their fate is sealed in an extended sequence detailing a tour through the 'Terrible Place', you know, that place in horror movies where bad things happen and would-be victims linger for a long, long time.<p>On his way to a job interview in Raleigh, our hero Chris rams his Mustang into an SUV that has been taken out by barbed wire purposely strung across a backwoods road in the mountains of West Virginia.  Enter victims: two couples and a single girl who is trying to...gasp...sob...get over a recent breakup by going on a fun camping trip.  Trying to find a phone (the cell phone device of modern times rendered useless by being in, well, the backwoods) they get rocketed back a few hundred years when they come across a cabin that, it becomes obvious in a few seconds, is inhabited by some truly scary creatures.  This sets up a long, long sequence of finding all sorts of neat things in this house of horrors like teeth in a jar, stolen merchandise from past victims, and a fridge full of organs and meat.  Infuriatingly, one girl insists on using the bathroom in this disgusting hovel, even after it's painfully obvious that INSANE KILLERS LIVE IN THIS HOUSE.  Even for a slasher flick, you have to wonder...<p>The killers in question are a group of mutants who, through generations of inbreeding, have turned into a truly vile cast of deformed, homicidal, cannibalistic savages.  They can't speak any known language, they have three fingers, humpbacks, and generally look like characters from The Dark Crystal on crack, yet they can drive, fire guns, and somehow not get discovered despite the regularity with which people disappear in the area.  Just in case you were thinking that this is a deeply cynical, ridiculous job of stereotyping by the filmmakers, the DVD featurettes inform us that ALL THE DEFORMITIES ARE BASED ON REAL MEDICAL CASES!  Whew!  And there I thought they were taking artistic license.<p>The film borrows heavily from the aforementioned films.  The Predator bits are the extended hiding and moving in the tall tree tops, bathed in shadow to mask sets.  And what a surprise, the film was even made in Canada, to shave yet a few more dollars off the clearly low budget.  The cast is mostly game, and in particular Jeremy Sisto stands out as better than the material (before he inevitably checks out after uttering the line "We are never going into the woods again!")  The approach the filmmakers seem to be taking is that this genre and setting is "new", and there is hardly a wink from the players to the audience to lighten it all up.<p>At least the DVD is heavy on features, though quantity does not equal quality.  The commentary is awful.  There are long stretches of utter silence as it's obvious that director and two stars just have nothing to say about this movie.  Unless you want to hear the gorgeous Eliza Dushku give a shoutout to her "Albanian peoples" you'll want to skip it.  And the deleted scenes?  Think about it, if they weren't good enough to make an 84-minute movie...<p>Actually, only scene is really cut, but it's just an alternate take of Dushku's big acting moment.  'Acting' here means some fake tears, and a...lot...of...pausing...between...sighs...and...gasps...when...she...talks...about...her...dead...friends...&lt;Pattract tourists.  <p>This was decent fare for a slow day.  Knock off a star if you don't like slasher flicks.  Recommended for die-hard genre addicts, else this is strictly rental fare.</p></body></html>

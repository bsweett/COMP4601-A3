<meta name="summary" content="Another Stephen King flick"></head><body><p>There is nothing in this horror movie that we have not seen before.  Film is based on King's short story about haunted room in NYC hotel.  It seems anyone who checks into this room does not check out alive.  For two hours we watch John Cusack's character get taunted by ghosts who talk to him on the phone and put his thru ordeal of steaming hot room, freezing room, flooded room...  It is almost as if writer and film director are trying to find every possible way known to mankind to kill this character.  The big premise of the film is actually play of our human psyche.  So if you are a parent, loosing a child would be one of the most fearful thought you could have.  Therefore, out ghosts in room 1408 play on main character's grief and guilt of not being able to protect his own child Katie of dying.  That emotion is the driving force of this film.  Adult viewing only.  Themes of suicide (i.e. jumping thru the window from the hotel's 14th floor) could be too disturbing for young audiences.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I will never understand why this movie is so well-regarded"></head><body><p>SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />Except for the critical knee-jerk reaction to label anything Pixar produces as brilliant, I will never understand the rationale for calling this movie anything other than a disgusting, boring waste of time.<br /><br />While on the whole Pixar does create brilliant animated work(the "Toy Story" films and the more recent "Up" numbering among those), this film was a colossal bomb which they hid behind admittedly impressive animated views of Paris and an appeal to snobbery under the guise of satirizing French cuisine.  Additionally, the audience is treated to several views of thousands of digitized rats swarming together.  It was massive, foolish hubris to think that it was possible to marry rats with cooking, and make it work.  Human nature itself rebels against the notion.<br /><br />Appearing vocally are Patton Oswalt and Jeaneane Garafalo, amongst others.  I suppose they are here to collect the inevitable large check, and say they've been in a Pixar movie.  It's just a shame that they could not have picked a better one.</p></body></html>

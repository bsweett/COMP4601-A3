<meta name="summary" content="An off-beat, thoughtful, and ultimately sad film"></head><body><p>Tom Hanks has to carry this film pretty much on his own and he does an admirable job. A FedEx employee used to an insanely, fast-paced life, he has to adjust to the danger and abject isolation of life alone on a desert island when his plane goes down in bad weather (an excellent sequence). Meanwhile his family have given him up for dead and moved on with their lives.<br /><br />"Cast Away" turns many of the romantic notions - of being stranded on a desert island and then being rescued and reunited with his family - on their head.<br /><br />It is ultimately a sad film that offers no easy resolution.<br /><br />The film-makers should be commended for making such an off-beat and thoughtful film.</p></body></html>

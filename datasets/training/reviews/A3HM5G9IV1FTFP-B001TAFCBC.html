<meta name="summary" content="Touching"></head><body><p>Written by Charlie Kaufman (writer of the wonderfully bizarre "Being John Malkovich") and directed by Michel Gondry (director of many of Bjork's amazingly inventive videos), I knew I would like "Eternal Sunshine". I expected it to be clever, interesting and fun. What I didn't expect was that it would turn out to be such a touching and poignant love story as well. I'm not a big fan of Jim Carrey, but he does very well here, going against type to play a subdued character who constantly refers to himself as "not that interesting". It's actually the luminous Kate Winslet (still radiantly gorgeous, even with blue hair) who plays the zany, unpredictable one, who Jim Carrey's character is drawn to, like a moth to a flame. The story has a slight sci-fi premise to it, with the two main characters trying to erase their memories of one another and their tumultuous relationship, but this film is really about love, relationships, fate and forgiveness. Aside from the love story involving the lead characters, there's also an interesting subplot involving the employees of the "memory erasing" agency, with Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood all giving terrific supporting performances. All in all, a terrific film.</p></body></html>

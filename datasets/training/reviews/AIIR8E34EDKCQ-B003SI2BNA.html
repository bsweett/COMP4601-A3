Sitting there in an almost empty Thursday movie viewing with a friend, I felt what the movie wanted to portray.<br /><br />I loved the emphasis on the wet, dark, cold, goose bump chilling visuals.<br /><br />Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) was a wonderfully convincing, loving and beautiful to look on film mother to her little daughter.<br /><br />She moved to Roosevelt Island, because it's what she can afford and takes up an apartment in a cold, unsavory and plain gloomy building. From the beginning every scene in the building had this knot in your throat feeling that something is not right, you almost feel an approaching colossos of doom spreading it's dark wings over their entire life.<br /><br />The water theme is constantly running through the movie, from dripping coming from her bedroom ceiling, to the mystery of the apartment upstairs, to the weird super who might be hiding something, to her ex husband who is giving her a hard time and back to her daughter who takes up talking to an imaginary Friend.<br /><br />This was a long, but visually rich movie. Every time I drive on the bridge ( i live in NYC) and see Roosevelt Island, I always remember this movie, and I get goosebumps.<br /><br />This is a great movie to put on a cold, rain night, with a cup of hot cocoa, a blanket and someone to hold your hand while you watch.<br /><br />I love the ending; how everything unraveled and then came together, altho I think I let a tear fall down my cheek, hey I'm sensitive, I can cry easily. So go see it before you judge it, its great.</p></body></html>

It's a wonderful story of just how far a man will go to get back to the love of his life.  Norton portrays Eisenheim, an illusionist who has a penchant for bizarre, almost supernatural magic tricks that captivate his audience.  As a teen, he falls for a young duchess (Biel).  However, he being the poor son of commoners and she being royalty, their love is forbidden and the two are separated for what seems like forever.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, we learn that Eisenheim has found his lovely duchess, but she is to wed Crown Prince Leopold (Sewell), a hateful, cocky man who is intent on scientifically and logically explaining all of Norton's magical acts.  Naturally, the Eisenheim and Duchess Sophie begin to meet secretly, only to have Leopold dispatch Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti) and his goons to find out what's really happening.  From there, the story begins to twist and turn.  It's full of deceit, rage, romance, and even a little bit of humor.  I can't speak much more about it or I'll give away too much.<br /><br />Norton is superb.  His lovelorn character becomes progressively sicker as the story unfolds, and he exerts all of his energy to reclaim the love of his life.  Biel does a wonderful job even though her accent isn't the most believable.  She carries off the role of royalty very well.  Giamatti is perfect as Uhl, who not only investigates the matter at hand, but narrates the story as well.  You don't know if you should root for him or pray that he gets his just desserts.  Sewell delivers, in my opinion, the top performance in this story.  He's arrogant, vengeful, and a baldfaced liar to boot.  His actions keep this story moving along at an acceptable pace.<br /><br />Overall, this film is well deserving of four-and-one-half stars.  It's a great flick that combines forbidden love, deceit, violence, and a little bit of magic all into one.  It's a definite keeper, and I give it my "must buy" seal of approval.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="sex and blood galore!"></head><body><p>i just finished watching this movie and let me tell you it was something else!theres near naked chicks the whole way through which wouldve kept me going right there,but then theres lots of blood and guts too!talk about double prizes!it is black and white mostly which im sure a lot of people will whine about,but a lot of good movies are black and white so dont be so stupid!there is color in certain parts,which is neat.one thing i did not like was how the characters are shot repeatedly or lethaly[at least debilitatingly] and are up and fighting in like 30 seconds.did i miss something?do they regenerate?bulletts only hurt a little bit?its very grapgicly violent and not for you hippie bleeding heart liberalistsw out there,so go watch dazed and confused for the millionth time and leave your protest groups to something worth fighting over.the movie is masterfully directed by quenten tarantino.so you know theres a lot of blood and guts in it!theres more than one creepy part so i suggest only those with a good tolerance for violence and lifetime type drama go see it.its a cool movie.</p></body></html>

Tom Cruise gets his chance to play a bad guy, and he puts in one of his better performances.  He plays a hitman who needs a ride.  As I suppose most hitmen would be, he's tempermental and invokes his own brand of ethics in order to justify his actions.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx portrays a run-of-the-mill Joe Nobody cab driver who gets caught picking up the "wrong" passenger.  Kind of wrong place / wrong time - squared.  As viewers, we end up putting ourselves in his place, and the result is quite a psychological thriller.<br /><br />I've always enjoyed Michael Mann movies & would not mind his making more films.  His works always bring an "intensity" to the table not normally found too often in most other films.  If you feel like being taken for a ride tonight, you can do a lot worse than COLLATERAL!!</p></body></html>

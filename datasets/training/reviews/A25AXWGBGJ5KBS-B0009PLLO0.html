<meta name="summary" content="A deeply flawed attempt at epic filmmaking."></head><body><p>Based on the several iterations that this film has evolved through, Oliver Stone tried to re-create the tone of those old-fashioned epic films (those old movies that were long, historical or religious in nature, and had intermissions...) but fails admirably.<br />He fails, in my opinion, in a most watchable catastrophic fashion, and because of that, I found myself admiring his chutzpah.<br /><br />The story has been well described in these various reviews. It's a dizzying attempt to cover the life of Alexander The Great.<br /><br />Many terrific actors (Kilmer, Jolie, etc.) give it their all. You can see them trying...even Colin Farrell. You can't say he doesn't commit to the role.<br /><br />Much has been written about the emphasis on homosexuality in this cut, and it is pervasive. I mean that the relationship with Hephaestion (Jared Leto) is arguably the central plot of the film.  This apparently accurately reflects historical data...but Stone almost makes it into a political statement. I just found it a little weird that it was emphasized SO much. I heard someone say that this film made "Rent" look like "Dirty Harry." I don't know if I'd go THAT far, but I see their point.<br /><br />It is beautifully shot; the war scenes are done well...technically it is what you would expect.<br /><br />From a storytelling perspective, this is an unqualified disaster. The timeshifting back and forth is so disorienting, even the titling doesn't help. ("Eight years earlier", "Four years later"...back and forth...back and forth...)<br /><br />The lines alternate between literate and cheesy, but all good epics have some of that...<br /><br />Anyways...I guess what I'm trying to say is that you kinda have to see this to believe it.<br /><br />But that's not a huge recommendation...</p></body></html>

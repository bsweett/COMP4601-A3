If you didn't catch the movie in theaters, surely you were aware that the movie was out. The branding campaign for this movie was unprecedented it seems with available merchandise ranging from breakfast cereals to children's gym shoes, books, video games, apparel, posters and more.<br /><br />Well if you didn't catch the movie in theaters the good thing is that now you can pick up the DVD. If you did check out the movie this past summer, chances are this is one that you may want to add to your DVD collection.<br /><br />Cars is the story about a red race car named Lightning McQueen. It appears that he is rather new to the championship aspect of racing as he doesn't have the biggest endorsements and he is still chasing the coveted Piston Cup. On his way to the Piston Cup Championship Race, the big rig truck that is carrying him dozes off and McQueen is accidentally ejected from the rig. This leaves McQueen lost in the middle of nowhere. He rips into a really old town named Radiator Springs where he is stranded. The town needs a new road and they enlist McQueen's help. McQueen isn't quite willing to help in the beginning but he soon grows close to the people he meets in town like the rusty pick-up truck Toe-Mater and a pretty blue Porsche named Sally.<br /><br />Cars is a really endearing story and the critics who hail the film as an instant classic are right on the money. It's a story you won't forget after watching it. However, the film is very long clocking in at 116 minutes, just four minutes under 2 hours. Some kids may get bored during parts of the film. The film has such a fast paced beginning and slows down drastically while McQueen is in Radiator Springs. The pace picks up again toward the end of the film after McQueen is rescued from Radiator Springs, but younger kids may have tuned out long ago.<br /><br />The film is rated G, but I will note there is one scene where McQueen shouts out that he is stuck in "Hillbilly Hell."</p></body></html>

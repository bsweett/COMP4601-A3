Written and directed by Kurt Wimmer, the premise is deceptively simple: after World War Four, society has had enough.  Human emotions are blamed for all violence, and the name of this new totalitarian society is Libria, run by the faceless Tetragrammaton.  Citizens dutifully inject themselves twice a day with a drug that supresses all feelings, even senses of touch and taste.  The movie is a fantastic futuristic action thriller that also touched my heart and provoked endless thought.  The reasoning behind eliminating human feelings makes some sense.  The other side of love is hate, and passion is often responsible for murder.  Why do people numb themselves with alcohol and drugs, even committ suicide?  Because feeling is sometimes too painful to bear.  We have all been let down, hurt by someone we love.  But that is a sacrifice we make, to feel love and friendship.<br /><br />Christian Bale is the center of the story.  A magnetic and mesmerizing actor who moves with the athletic grace of a tiger, he plays Cleric John Preston.  As a top enforcer against "sense offenders," Preston even executes another cleric (Sean Bean - Boromir in the Lord of the Rings) who has succumbed to Yeat's poetry.  "Tread lightly on my dreams."  Bean gives quite a touching performance.  Preston has two young children, but his wife was incinerated for sense offenses.  Of course, Preston feels nothing.  There is a resistance, of course, underground people who are not injecting and "feeling."  They cling to cheesy knick-knacks and tacky art, anything to evoke emotion.  These scenes of confiscated snow-globes and faded paintings are very sad.  Even sadder is a scene where companion animals are exterminated because they serve no purpose except love.  I cried at this scene.<br /><br />The sets and acting are very good.  Taye Diggs plays a villian here - how odd to see that engaging, bright smile become sinister!  He is also very good in combat scenes.  Angus MacFayden (Robert the Bruce in Braveheart) plays Preston's supervisor. Emily Watson (Punch-Drunk Love) plays Mary O'Brien, a woman arrested for sense offense and sentenced to incineration. The movie is very violent, with lots of bloody executions and tons of gunfire.  But the hand-to-hand martial arts combat scenes are breathtaking.  The DVD contains a nice featurette entitled "Finding Equilibrium."  The featurette contains interviews with Bale, Diggs, Wimmer, and Watson, although Watson is so soft-spoken you really can't hear what she is saying!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="How can a train be lost?"></head><body><p>Probably one of the better questions asked on this journey.  Wes Anderson takes the audience on yet another humorous voyage of discovery aboard the Darjeeling Limited, but not without a little misdirection first.  Just when you think this is going to be another movie with Bill Murray, Adrien Brody overtakes the "businessman" on the railway platform and leaps aboard the departing train, joining his brothers in a first class cabin where they are treated to sweet limes by the lovely Rita.<br /><br />Anderson returns to an early format, Bottle Rocket, in setting up this spiritual journey led by the intrepid Owen Wilson.  Jason Schwartzman, who gets writing credits this time around, fills out the trio.  The movie drifts along at the pace you would expect from Anderson, less a travelogue of India than it is a clever study on fraternal relations.  We do get a spicy taste of India, replete with a splendid array of colors and a very touching sequence of events in an Indian village, not to mention another fun soundtrack drawing on the Kinks, Stones and even Joe Dassin.  The brothers finally do seem to reforge their bond, with an ironic wink.<br /><br />The DVD includes the all important "Hotel Chevalier," cast in warm yellow tones, that is referred to throughout the film, underscored by Peter Sarstedt's wonderful "Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)".  It provides important clues to Schwartzman's character and features a fetching Natalie Portman as Jack's girlfriend.  See it first.</p></body></html>

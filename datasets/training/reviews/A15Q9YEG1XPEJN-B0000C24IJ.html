<meta name="summary" content="Good acting, fair script and direction - but a rip off"></head><body><p>Wrong Turn is a surprisingly well crafted film that delivers chills and suspense in several places.  It isn't bad when compared to other slasher/gore films, but it isn't a mature horror film.<p>I have two majorissues I have to take with the film: the script and the motive.  Since the motive comes out of the scripting, I guess we're looking at a point and a subpoint.<p>The opening credits treats us to a series of photos and newspaper articles flashing by (ala Se7en).  It is these photos and articles, I assume, that is supposed to suffice for the motive that I state is missing.<p>Before I go further, if you haven't seen the movie, skip to the end of my review, because I'll be giving away a few plot points.<p>The killers in this film are supposed to be deranged "mountain men" who murder unsuspecting victims in the woods of West Virginia.  That is what the newspaper tout in the credits and that is what happens.  That is not a motive!  That is just a statement.  Why do these guys kill?  The fact that they are "inbred" is not excuse enough.  Do the filmmakers intend to state that the people living in the mountains of West Virginia are all inbred?  Other than the policeman who answers a rescue call, we are not shown a single person from the area who is not obviously from inbred blood.  So ARE the filmmakers trying to make such a radical statement?  If this is the intent, then the people of West Virginia  - particularly those living in the mountainous areas - have quite a case for bigotry on the part of the filmmakers.  I don't think that was what was ultimately intended, but it does need some answering.<p>Now, here's my subpoint problem with the film:  Wrong Turn owes its existence in large part to the "Home" episode of the television series The X-Files.  In that episode we have a family of inbred people living in Pennsylvania who have kept to themselves for over a century, never bothering anyone.  It is only once the FBI is called in to investigate the burial of a deformed child that the inbred family resorts to murder - and only then to protect themselves from the outside world.  The people in this episode are severely deformed and very good at survival.<p>Wrong Turn takes several liberties with the television show premise:  there are three men, but no woman as in the TV show.  The three men apparently kill for the sheer pleasure of doing so, whereas in the TV show the men kill to protect themselves from the outside world.  <p>Yes, this film is shot very well - in fact, brilliantly at times.  Yes, the acting is superior - none of the old "drag anyone off the streets to star in the film" stuff that Friday the 13th had.  Eliza Dushku and Jeremy Sisto are particularly good.  The mood is right and the scare factor is there.  And, compared to early horror films of this type (Friday 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc.), it's just as gory, but in a more purile way.  There's no need for most of it.<p>It's just that I wish there was an answer to the "why".  Why did these guys kill people?<p>In the grand scheme of things, this isn't a terrible film.  I think it is a well made, well acted film that satisfies quite nicely for a night of gore, if that's your cup of tea (or blood, as it were).</p></body></html>

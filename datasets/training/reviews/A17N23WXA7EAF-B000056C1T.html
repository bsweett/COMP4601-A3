<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining but Ridiculously Inaccurate"></head><body><p>"The Patriot" is an immensely entertaining, action packed film with some of the best battlefield and hand-to-hand combat scenes in modern cinema. Mel Gibson plays a retired British soldier and master of a tobacco plantation, named Captain Martin, in South Carolina at the start of the Revolutionary War. As the colonists get fired up and prepare for the eight-year struggle that will ultimately make them Americans the Captain is reluctant to join in the action. Having earned a bloodthirsty reputation in a controversial incident during the preceding French and Indian War, Martin wants no part of the horrors to come. But Martin is unable to prevent his son, Gabriel from enlisting with the rebels and when the tide of the war turns against them, a wounded Gabriel finds himself back on the plantation pursued by British dragoons. When the evil leader of the dragoons captures Gabriel and leads him off to be executed, Martin is suddenly forced to dust off his old war trunk, retrieve his tomahawks and pistols from it, and to fulfill our cinematic hopes by blasting back from his retirement. What follows are some amazing, rifle ambushes, swash buckling, realistically choreographed tomahawk fighting and a whole lot of absurd historical propaganda.<p>Historical propaganda? Yes, I'm afraid so. While the battle scenes in this film are immensely realistic, the historical picture it portrays is specious to the point of idiocy. I don't mind that a whole lot of rhetoric floats around about "the cause" and "the country" and any other allusions to the magnificent nation to come when in fact the primary cause of the Revolution was the desire to eliminate excessive British taxation. It doesn't even bother me that the film makers go overboard in vilifying the British by having them massacre civilians in a scene more reminiscent of Nazi occupied Europe or a Central American village that had fallen into the hands of CIA trained death squads. <p>What really irritates me is how in a scene that screams of revisionism, a black slave joins the colonists in their final battle and says he's doing it "for the cause". Doesn't he realize, as the audience surely must, that when this war is over his people still have one hundred years of official slavery ahead of them, and another hundred years of brutal oppression to follow? Or do the filmmakers hope to persuade us that the Revolutionary War was a beautiful, egalitarian, multi-cultural event? Somehow I doubt audience members will go home and pick up Charles A. Beard's "An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States" which clearly spells out that the sacred parchment that ultimately resulted from the Revolutionary War represented a very narrow class of white property owners and excluded the poor, blacks, and women. Having enjoyed Mel Gibson's visceral tomahawk handling, our kids will go home and think that slavery played no part in the building of this country because the black guy in the movie got to fight alongside the white guys "for the cause". It's funny how we have to rate our films for healthy things such as nudity and sexuality but not for something as destructive as a flagrant historical lie.</p></body></html>

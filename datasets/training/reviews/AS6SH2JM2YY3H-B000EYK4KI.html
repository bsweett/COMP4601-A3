<meta name="summary" content="Could be a lot better, but great chemistry between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie"></head><body><p>Mr. and Mrs. Smith (the  "Mrs." clearly is intentional as opposed to "Ms.") is a fun spoof of the "What?  You mean we are both secret assassins and we've been married for 6 years (or 5, as Mr. Smith thinks), and we never even had a clue?" genre.<br /><br />Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are great in their roles as assassins in their day jobs, and dull domestic partners in the evening.  The highlight off this movie is the fight scene in their home, when they've come to the somewhat misguided conclusion that the only way out of the mess of working for two opposing agencies is to take out the other.  Lots of firepower and broken glass here.  The neighbors even notice!<br /><br />The worse part is toward the end (not telling you how it will end, of course).  Mr. and Mrs. Smith's bullets miraculously hit every time; miraculously since their opponents are wearing total body armor.  In the meantime, their opponents always, always miss.  The grim expressions on Brad and Angelina's faces, along with lots of paint cans exploding and two fisted shooting, don't cover up this glaring inconsistency.  They weren't this accurate when they were shooting at each other!  Perhaps that is because they really didn't want to cause violence to the other... except for the head butts, kicking, and punching.<br /><br />You know, there was a lot of violence in this movie!<br /><br />See it once to observe the chemistry that got Brad and Angelina together (their first child together was announced this week).  Then you can move on to other entertainment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good addition to the Anti Hero Genre"></head><body><p>The anti here genre of movies was always a favorite of mine.  Main reason being, is that if you look in the average movie or story, the good guys tend to be dull, and the bad guys are the most interesting characters in the movie.  Examples of anti heroes are Snake Plisken(Escape from New York), Jack Carter(Get Carter), or Porter(Payback).  These weren't heroes with lofty ideals or alturistic goals, these were villians that happened to have similar goals to the protagonists or were coherced in to helping a good cause.  Riddick is now added to this line of anti heroes.<p>The plot is relatively simplistic, and would probably fail under scrutiny, but it isn't the point of the movie.  The idea is that this is some sort of interstellar bus/plane travelling through an unpopulated part of the galaxy.  They get hit by a rain of small meteors and the ship starts to go down.  The co pilot attempts to jettison the passenger section to save ship, but the system jams and the ship crashes on a seemingly unihabited planet.<p>The planet is a surreal landscape, there is more than one sun, and it creates a strange surreal lighting, nothing seems quite real.  The planet is a desert and desolate, nothing but rocks and sand for as long as they can see.  When they make stock of who survived they find that they have two passengers that were unexpected, a marshal of some sort, and an escaped convict named Riddick.  An almost inhuman predator that had been recently recaptured and was being brought back into incarceration.  <p>Upon some exploration of the planet they find that it wasn't completely deserted.  They find a large collection of bones, like an elepahnt graveyard for some giant creatures.  As well as what appears to be a science station, seemingly deserted for years.  This seems like a boon since they can use some of the lefteover equipment to reapair a ship.  But three things happen that radically change their plans.  One is Riddick escapes and is on the prowl.  Two, is that the previous lifeforms on the planet were wiped out by a vicious flying creature that inhabits the planet in swarms.  Three, the creatures are highly photosensitive, but the planet is shifting, and the sun is going down.  With this planet, that could mean weeks.<p>This was a suprisingly good movie.  Not one that you worry on the plot or dialogue, but to sit back and enjoy the ride.  Diesel is great as the predator diesel.  Seemingly more like a jungle cat on the prowl than an escaped convict.  He really looks like he is toying with the survivors.  Not trying to kill or hurt them, but playing strange games that serve no purpose aside from enjoyment.<p>the rest of the cast is a bit cliche, but they are just vehicles for the main character and the story.  Which is similar to a James Cameron film, they land in a dark place, and things keep getting darker.  Some faces arer recognizable from the sci fi genre, noticably Claudia Black from Farscape fame.  They aren't bad, but they are obviously just backdrops and victims.  The alien species is interesting and vicious, and the situation created by them gives the movie a desperate feel.<p>I wouldn't rate this movie as perfect, but fun.  It is a good action flick and, so far, Vin Diesel's best work yet.</p></body></html>

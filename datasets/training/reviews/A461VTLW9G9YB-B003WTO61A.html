<meta name="summary" content="carrie"></head><body><p>This movie is a horror film yes. But it's not as scary as films now a days. This film is about a girl named Carrie White. She is picked on everyday and has no friends. Soon she figures out she has telekenetic powers. She reseaches it and learns that other people have it. Her mother sees that she has that power and is upset. Her mother thinks that everything is a sin. If you ask me the mother is the scariest thing about this movie. Then  the classic prom scene. Almost everyone is dead. Carrie goes home and kills her mother and the house collapses. No more Carrie.</p></body></html>

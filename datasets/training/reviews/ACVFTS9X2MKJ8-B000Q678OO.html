<meta name="summary" content="The third times a charm, and well worth the re-purchase just one more time"></head><body><p>This was my favorite movie for more than 30 years.  It was also one of my first purchases on DVD many years ago.  A few years later, they released yet another newly mastered version.<br /><br />But now, this third mastering takes the cake!  The picture quality is fabulous, and so is the sound of the remastered soundtrack.  The music sounds cleaner than my soundtrack CD of "A Clockwork Orange."  And all these special features make this film all well worth having to buy it again, one last time.<br /><br />But the point I want to make the most about this release IS about the newly remastered video transfer.  This film looks excellent!  This proves to me, once again, that there is no need to waste my money upgrading to Blu-Ray DVD's because it is possible to have High Definition standard DVD's.<br /><br />I won't let myself fall into that trap of replacing all my favorite DVD's with Blu-Ray DVD's.  If YOU do then you're looking at an expensive future of buying all your favorite movies all over again.<br /><br />And you know what?  I'll bet, within 5 years or so from now, they'll say they've come out with something better than Blu-Ray DVD's, and you'll be suckered into replacing all your favorite DVD's once again.<br /><br />Blu-Ray is another example of the never-ending cycle of making sure that you keep buying your favorite movies, over and over again.<br /><br />And then over and over again, and over and over again, and then something new will come out and you'll buy all your favorite movies over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and then something new will come out and you buy all your favorite movies over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and then something new will come out and you'll buy your favorite movies over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and then something new will come out and then you'll buy your favorite movies over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and so on and so on....<br /><br />If you start to invest in Blu-Ray now, the movie industry obviously has you wrapped around their finger.<br /><br />I'm sure the standard DVD will never go away.  We've all invested so much in our video library that most of us are going to continue to cherish what we already have, and maybe only replace some particular favorite films when a newly remastered version is released.  That just makes more sense.  Don't you think?</p></body></html>

Never have we seen anything like this fantastic film before. First off, with a great and seemingly plausible story by Michael Crichton, good casting and performances, and absolutely wonderful cutting edge CGI by ILM and the full scale creature effects of Stan Winston this movie will be very hard to ever top. The work that went into paleontology research, animal motion and design studies for the full scale dino work of Stan Winston made me feel like I now know what actual prehistoric animals look like in action.<br /><br />Most important was the basic story which was one of the best science fiction novels I have ever read. The author is reported to have discussed his cloning ideas with friends at MIT who were in agreement that the described approach seemed most plausible. I would expect the actual cloning of a mammoth to occur in our lifetime. Of course, only a Steven Spielberg and his great eye for composition, editing and direction could have pulled all the necessary talent together!  Hats off to Sam Neill and the entire cast for their great performances.  A movie experience this great only happens a couple of times in a movie goers lifetime.<br /><br />The documentary on the making of the film was also excellent and very informative, as well as the other extras provided on the DVD. Although many later new movies have incorporated credible dino CGI, the excellent detailmovies. This movie sets the new gold standard for state of the art CGI and full scale creature effects.</p></body></html>

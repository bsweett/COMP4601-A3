<meta name="summary" content="Creepy and Moving"></head><body><p>I was very surpised by this film.  Actually, I had heard various things - pro and con- and was somewhat led astray by the trailers.  This is a thriller and a very creepy one at that, but it never devolves into a violent gore-fest or a typical action thriller - that is a good thing.  Instead Robin Williams (in an amazing performance) leads us through the creepy and moving downfall of a lonely and disturbed man.  It is very effectively directed and scored.  This is the kind of film that will send the shivers down your spine while also filling you up with a good dose of empathy.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

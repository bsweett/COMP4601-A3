YES, IT IS THE TRILOGIES CONCLUSION.. BUT WILL WE SEE ANTHONY HOPKINS REPRISE HIS ROLE AGAIN. I'M ALL FOR IT. HOWEVER, I WILL BE CONTENT WITH "RED DRAGON" BEING THE LAST HANNIBAL LECTOR FILM. ANTHONY HOPKINS (SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, HANNIBAL, BRAM STOKERS DRACULA), EDWARD NORTON (FIGHT CLUB, PRIMAL FEAR, PEOPLE vs. LARRY FLYNT), HARVEY KEITEL (THE PIANO, RESERVOIR DOGS, PULP FICTION), RALPH FIENNES (SHINE, SCHINDLER'S LIST, THE ENGLISH PATIENT), MARY LOUSIE PARKER (FRIED GREEN TOMOTOES, LONGTIME COMPANION, BOYS ON THE SIDE) ARE ALL GREAT WITH A CAPITOL GEE!! MOST NOTED EDWARD NORTON WHO HAS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS EVER SINCE  "PRIMAL FEAR". AS FOR THE MOVIE.. RIGHT WHEN I THOUGHT IT WAS OVER, A CHILLING CLIMAX CAME OUT OF NOWHERE. WHICH LEFT ME TWICE AS SATISFIED. CLOSER TO "SILENCE OF THE LAMBS" THAN "HANNIBAL". A MUST FOR FANS OF ANTHONY HOPKINS AS HANNIBAL THE CANNIBAL. NOTE: THIS FILM IS A PREQUEL. IT TAKES PLACE BEFORE "THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS".</p></body></html>

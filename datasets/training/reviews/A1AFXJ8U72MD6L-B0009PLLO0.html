<meta name="summary" content="GOOD EPIC PIECE WITH HEART BUT SLOW IN SOME CASES"></head><body><p>Compared to most epics it was historically accurate although some liberties were taken (i.e the horse didn't die in that battle but from old age, etc).<br /><br />However, the battle of Gaugemala, the snakes of his mother, the winning over of the horse tied to its shadow, his father missing an eye . . . wow, I could go on for pages but there's a lot that's on the money.<br /><br />Focus was more on philosophical and academic teachings to the audience which I could see having a negative impact.  You need to watch this film closely to get it or you will get lost.  Trying to do something else, as I found, will make you miss important moments.<br /><br />Accents were mostly Celtic/Irish and most Historians feel the Macedonians were Celts anyway.<br /><br />Negative aspects?  Lots of stories going on and flashbacks hopping back and forth. Some people may not get or be turned off by the massive symbolism.<br /><br />I can see American audiences having problems w/ the film as Alexander as portrayed as pan sexual and in touch with his feminine side.  American heroes are super masculine right now.<br /><br />Additionally, his parents did a good job of messing him up emotionally, so, some people might see him as weak even though, at his height, he controlled more square miles than the Roman Empire at its height.<br /><br />Would have liked to have seen the razing of Thebes but they took that out.  Not sure if they did the Gordian Knot routine.<br /><br />Again, extremely accurate in History compared to most epic films . . . they even used Mary Renault's old books on Alexander for the digging up of ideas.<br /><br />MY GRADE: B.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Great Remake that Stands on Its Own!"></head><body><p>I just got back from seeing this one with my Dad mainly because we both liked the original and we read some good reviews on this remake. If critics like an action remake, it usually means that it's one worth checking out. The acting is better than it should be in this kind of film, with Ethan Hawke and Laurence Fishburne being the obvious best of the bunch. I loved the intense prologue scene with Ethan undercover and Fishburne displays some of his best acting to date throughout the movie in a way that his character never gets tiresome or cliched. Maria Bello and Drea de Matteo are eye candy and not much more, but I'm not complaining. If you want to see a movie with tons of action, a tight tension filled pace, and more violence and gore than usually seen in a movie like this, check out "Assault on Precinct 13." This is easily the best action film to come out in quite some time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Frank Miller's Sin City is a masterpiece......A knockout!!"></head><body><p>Opens up with a rooftop scene with a man and a woman...Josh Hartnett (Wicker Park) who plays a assassin and Marley Shelton (Valentine) who he kills. Then we get into more and more gritty, bloody, brutal and knockout hardcore stuff with 3 intermingling stories. Goes to Hartigan,played by a always rock solid Bruce Willis (Hostage), who rescues an 11 year old girl from the hands of a rapist, played by Nick Stahl (Bully) but Hartigan ends up on the recieveing end of a bunch of bullets landing him in the hospital. The first has Mickey Rourke(Once Upon A Time In Mexico) in a very very good comeback peformance as Marv who's love Goldie, played by Jaime King (Pearl Harbor) was killed by a silent assassin/cannibalistic psycho named Kevin, played with silent creepiness by Elijah Wood (Lord Of The Rings Trilogy). Marv finds out that Goldie has a twin sister named Wendy, also played by Jaime King. So, Marv goes on a brutal killing spree in which he slices and dices everyone who gets in his path and ends up in a showdown with Kevin Boy. The electric chair scene was crazy!! Next up we follow shiny red converse wearing Dwight, played by a dynamic Clive Owen (Closer) who gets involved with a waitress named Shelly, played by Brittany Murphy (Little Black Book) and the corrupy cop named Jackie Boy, played by a insanely terrific Benicio Del Toro (The Way Of The Gun). Jackie Boy and his goons all get killed by some vicious hookers, led by Gail, a juicy Rosario Dawson (Alexander). They figure out that they killed a corrupt cop. My favorite scene in this whole movie would have to be when Dwight (Owen) is driving with a dead Jackie Boy (Del Toro)in the passenger seat and suddenly Jackie Boy starts to talk to him. The scene flips from different colors and that's the scene in which Quentin Tarantino special guest directed. Michael Clarke Duncan (Armageddon) and gang kidnap Gail (Dawson) for the head of Jackie Boy and it ends up in a major bloodbath. The last one is the rest of Hartigan's (Willis') story where he goes to jail for something he didnt do and when he is let go he goes in search of a fully grown up Nancy Callahan, played by the delicious Jessica Alba (Honey) and he has to save her from the treacherous clutches of The Yellow Bastard who was the rapist (Nick Stahl) in which he saved little Nancy from before and Willis "litterally" punches The Yellow Bastard's brains in and rips off his other head as well. Josh Hartnett is also at the end, like in the beginning, playing the same man/assassin as he appears in an elevator with hooker Becky, played by Alexis Bleidel (Gilmore Girls). Also starring Michael Madsen (Kill Bill 1 and 2), Devon Aoki (D.E.B.S.), Nicky Katt (Suburbia), Powers Boothe (Frailty), Rutger Hauer (Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Carla Gugino (Spy Kids Trilogy) and Frank Miller himself is in this...he's the preist whom Marv (Rourke) kills. Fast, ferocious and better then the crap that's been coming out for the past couple of months...although I liked Constantine. Frank Miller fans...trust me, you wont be disappointed...a knockout masterpiece.</p></body></html>

Oh, let me assure anyone who might stumble across this humbly submitted review that Letters from Iwo Jima is a good movie, but it doesn't merit the term "great" in the way that recent World War Two productions such as Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, and HBO's Band of Brothers all do, and this revelation caught me off guard. Even amid the orgies of death and wasted self-sacrifice in Clint Eastwood's tale from the Japanese side of the front, we have a sort of cinematic version of World War Two-lite which has much in common with 2001's Enemies At The Gate, another genre film that aimed for something outside its grasp. To single out Letters' worst flaw I would say it felt rushed, and it lacked those on-screen qualities I can only term heart and soul.<br /><br />The fact is Letters from Iwo Jima felt incomplete. It also seemed hollow. Whereas the real life battle of Iwo Jima involved many thousands of combatants on both sides, never when seeing this film did I ever witness more than a perhaps a score of Japanese soldiers grouped together, and even what could have been the immensity of the American landing on the shores of this mortally-contested protrusion of earth was underwhelming and hurried through. I felt I was seeing less an epic than an intimate project involving a miniscule company of players in an almost theatrical setting. I also felt let-down that the director ended the motion picture as he did, rapidly, abruptly, without meaningful closure. One more scene, even, of the featured Japanese survivor returning home to his wife and child would have added much depth to the climax of what was often simultaneously deep and shallow storytelling. Pacing was problematic all during this story, and nevermore than at its conclusion. Having anticipated much, I felt disappointed.<br /><br />There were strong performances in Letters and there were a few memorable moments, but as I've twice pointed out, despite a long running time everything felt forced and impelled toward brevity. The scenes of General Tadamichi Kuribayashi's time spent among Americans in happier pre-war days were frustratingly brief and inexplicably under-explored. There were more things wrong with Letters from Iwo Jima than there were right, and that's not how it was supposed to be: not in a movie this acclaimed and with this much inter-continental talent involved.<br /><br />I'll rate this much-discussed movie as four stars, but I almost felt it was closer to three.</p></body></html>

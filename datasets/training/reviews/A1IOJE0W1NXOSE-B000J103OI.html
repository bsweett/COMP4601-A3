<meta name="summary" content="Meryl Streep is amazing!"></head><body><p>This movie revolves around Meryl Streep (Miranda), the editor of a prestigious fashion magazine who is, to all intents and purposes, the worst boss ever.  She is cold, cruel, demanding, rude, and altogether wonderful in this part.  Her counterpart is Andy, played by Anne Hathaway, who is hired as Miranda's second assistant despite the fact that she is a size 6 (gasp!) who has no fashion sense and very little interest in the fashion industry.  Her goal is to become a journalist and this job is just a stepping stone along the way.  Andy's honesty and earnest attitude gain Miranda's respect and soon she is transformed into a fashionable, workaholic who sacrifices her friends and social life in order to be at Miranda's beck and call.  She goes along with Miranda's plan to reduce the influence of the first assistant, and thus becomes a full-fledged Junior Miranda.  This is an entertaining movie, slickly produced and wonderfully acted.  Meryl Streep plays Miranda with an understated elegance and feline grace, her humanity lying deep within her cold exterior, only allowed to show through in one brief scene.  As always, Meryl Streep makes this character into someone truly memorable, and the movie well worth seeing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable"></head><body><p>Having read the book a couple of years ago, I have to admit I enjoyed this movie. Amazon will only let me give 3 stars, but really, I want to give this 3.5. I just couldn't bring myself to give a 4 because this movie was flawed in some parts, but it IS a step above 3 stars. If you haven't read the book, then you might not enjoy this movie as much, because it is very scattered in some parts.<br /><br />Having read the book, I had no problem with seeing what was going on, but my roomate, not having read the book, needed me to explain a few parts in the movie for better understanding. If a producer/writer can't make a book adaptation clear, then there is a clear problem.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't the best, but there were some great parts, although I am disappointed at the way that some of the parts of the book were changed or just cut out. I realize you can't put the whole book in a movie, but it would be nice if the writers had put together a more coherent and tighter script for the movie, it felt more attention was paid to visuals and special effects than the story itself. Obviously, this movie is not for everyone, so you need to judge for yourself.</p></body></html>

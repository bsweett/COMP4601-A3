<meta name="summary" content="The fog versus the giant mantis"></head><body><p>Sorry but this is one of those run-of-the-mill monsters in the dark or creeps in the fog movies. The monsters are not scarier. The victims are standard group.  Some are heroes, some are rats, and some are just fillers.  If nobody gets out alive, we will be better off.<br /><br />The miracle is how they can think of new deadly fog things for two hours and seven minutes without getting bored.  It's a wonder that somebody can watch for two hours and seven minutes without using the fast-forward button.  I suggest that you keep the fast-forward button handy right after the beginning credits.  You can push it until the ending credits, and you will have saved two hours and nearly 7 minutes.<br /><br />Basic story Mist finds town, people hide in store, some people stick nose out, nose does not return.<br /><br />Both "The blob" and the "Deadly Mantis." Have more structure, suspense, and social redeeming value.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6302763916">Deadly Mantis (1957)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W3HE">The Blob - Criterion Collection</a></p></body></html>

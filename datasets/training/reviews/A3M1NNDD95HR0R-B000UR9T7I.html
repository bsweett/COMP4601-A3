<meta name="summary" content="Spider-Man 3 Does Not Disappoint"></head><body><p>This movie is a "must see" for all superhero fans, action movie fans, and especially Spider-Man fans.  There were many negative reviews floating around about this movie, but also many reviews claiming it was excellent as well.  The range of different opinions was really surprising.<br /><br />Modern special effects really do Spider-Man justice, and it is clear that a lot of thought went into this movie, as well as a lot of hard work with the computer animation effects.  They are very high quality and truly seem real.  There was so much going on, really a lot to sink your teeth into.  It's complicated but still manages to be understandable throughout.  It's around 2 1/2 hours long, but time flies because you are having fun.  Some complained that there was not enough time with Venom, which is a valid point, but I'm sure that the movie in it's entirety will make up for that.  All I can say is if you fit into one of the said categories, give this movie a chance.  You will not regret it.</p></body></html>

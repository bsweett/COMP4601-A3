This movie is the perfect combination of action and comedy without being too cheesy. I enjoyed the special effects and storyline as well. I felt the acting was great by all cast members as well! My hubby was a huge fan of the "Get Smart" television series and he felt that the movie was the modern version of "Get Smart".</p></body></html>

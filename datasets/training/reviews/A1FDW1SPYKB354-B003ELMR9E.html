<meta name="summary" content="Vintage Pacino; A Fine DVD!"></head><body><p>I'm actually reviewing the "Widescreen" version of Insomnia. But had to use the Full Screen link (none available on the Widescreen page at the time of review).<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film, which features excellent performances (IMO) by the three leads (Al Pacino, Hilary Swank, and Robin Williams, in a rare evil role).<br /><br />Pacino really gives you the impression he has insomnia here, looking pretty ragged around the edges for much of the picture. It's almost impossible (for me) to not like a Pacino picture.  He's great in just about everything. And this is no exception.<br /><br />The DVD's commentary tracks are rather unique. Director Nolan takes us through the film chronologically, in the order in which it was filmed, starting with Day 1 (which is Scene #111!).<br /><br />The other commentaries are scene specific, which I like much better than having to watch the entire movie a second time just for the commentaries, which are oft times filled with silence.  I wish every DVD had commentaries like the ones on "Insomnia".  Excellent!<br /><br />And how about that Easter Egg?!  Outstanding!  Clicking on that pencil next to Hilary in the "Production Diaries" area of the DVD will enable you to witness an avalanche that occurred during the film's production. The quick-thinking Wally Pfister (Insomnia's Director of Photography) was able to record the moment on video tape. We even get a glimpse of Hilary Swank at the end of this short clip, who comments on witnessing this unforseen event: "It was so awesome!"<br />This has got to be one of the coolest Eggs I've yet to encounter on a disc!<br /><br />All-in-all, a Grade-A film and DVD presentation.</p></body></html>

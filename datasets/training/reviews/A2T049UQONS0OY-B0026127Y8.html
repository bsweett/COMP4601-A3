<meta name="summary" content="Some fun but almost as ridiculous as Death Wish Part 5"></head><body><p>One recent moment of great humor for me was watching 72-year-old Charles Bronson destroy bad guys and outrun automatic weapon fire during the fifth installment of his ever popular "Death Wish" series. That movie, made in 1994, was the end of the line for fans of that particular series. While Charles Bronson apparently wasn't available to play the lead here, "Taken" seems to have, ahem, taken up the mantle from "Death Wish 5" with ridiculous levels of action and heroism.<br /><br />If you've been living in a cave somewhere, the plot of "Taken" is Liam Neeson's 17-year-old daughter goes to France with her teenage friend -- over dad's objections -- and is almost immediately kidnapped. This happens while she's on the phone with dad, a former security expert, who ends up talking to her kidnapper and vowing revenge.<br /><br />Having apparently no financial worries, Neeson flies to Paris, almost immediately finds out who did the kidnapping, finds the guy and chases him to his death on a freeway ramp. This begins a lengthy discourse in ultra-violence and bloodletting rare even for this genre of film. You probably can figure out for yourself without seeing the movie the sequence of events and ending, so I won't bother with them. Suffice it to say the body count is high and the action plentiful.<br /><br />I found myself both involved in this movie and laughing through much of it. There is no indication the filmmakers were trying to create a parody and the leading man certainly does nothing to generate laughs. He is completely serious throughout in the same way the steely-eyed and thoughtless James Bond of Daniel Craig contrasts to the cool, tongue in cheek and sophisticated superagent portrayl of Sean Connery.<br /><br />If you like action, revenge and/or violence, you should watch this film at your earliest opportunity. It's pretty good as these films go with fine production qualities. Neeson's characterization, while not credible because of a flawed script and lack of vision, is compelling nonetheless. You'll probably root for him whether you like the movie or not.</p></body></html>

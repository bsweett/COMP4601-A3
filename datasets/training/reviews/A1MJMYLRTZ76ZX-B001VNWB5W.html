<meta name="summary" content="The best super hero movie ever"></head><body><p>Not being familiar with the original graphic novel as I was with The Dark Knight I didn't have any expectations for this movie, but it far surpassed any I might have had. This is just a tremendously entertaining, hard-hitting, and dynamic movie, and at about 2 hours and 40 minutes, of truly epic proportions.<br /><br />It's also very gritty, violent, and with a number of adult scenes, so it might not be appropriate for the whole family.<br /><br />I'm sure the fans will have their bones to pick, but I couldn't find any serious shortcomings in the entire movie. Everything is just solid--the story, the script, the acting, and special effects. Not being able to speak with any authority about faithfulness to the original, I'll stick to a few comments about the movie itself.<br /><br />The series of lead-in scenes with the alternative history of a number of famous and iconic events is possibly the greatest movie lead-in I've seen. It's a brilliant start to a brilliant movie. And they go on for seemingly ten or fifteen minutes. And whoever the cinematographer was, he's truly an artist with the camera, creating many stunning shots and sequences. So the movie has tremendous visual appeal in addition to its other many strengths and attractions.<br /><br />All the actors were great in their roles, and not knowing the original characters I can't fault anything there. But overall the quality of the acting seemed excellent.<br /><br />As far as the quality of the video transfer goes, again I'm no expert, but I can say that on my 48-inch Samsung HD TV the quality seemed just fine. This DVD isn't a high-def transfer but it looked quite good on my TV, but it has internal upscaling and also I have an audio-visual processor, which, while not super-high end, is supposed to be decent, so that might account for video quality.<br /><br />The movie builds up to a dramatic climax, which is certainly a bittersweet one, but so as not to mention any spoilers I'll leave it at that. Overall, I think this is the best super hero movie of all time and one of the best movies of the year.</p></body></html>

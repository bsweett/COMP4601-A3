<meta name="summary" content="Finding and flirting with that fetish"></head><body><p>Amsterdam, one of the funnest places in the world.  Where better to begin our trip?  Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) are two horny young men vacationing through Europe with new friend, Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson).  Staying in a hostel in Amsterdam and accidentally locked out after curfew, they are invited in through the window of a neighboring house by an oddball named Alex (Lubomir Bukovy).<br /><br />Alex tells the young men of a hostel in Slovakia where the girls will do anything for Americans, so instead of traveling to Barcelona they leave for Bratislava.  When they arrive, they discover they are sharing living quarters with Natalya (Barbara Nedeljakova) and Svetlana (Jana Kaderabkova) who show the boys a good time.  The next morning, Oli is missing.  Paxton and Josh wind out partying again with Natalya and Svetlana while searching for Oli, and they too are separated after becoming extremely drunk ... or drugged.<br /><br />It is here that this movie takes off, and dips us into the horrors of what the girls call an "Art Show" but turns out to be a horrifying nightmare for those whose admittance is free.  It is here in this exclusive "resort" that the very wealthy pay enormous sums of money to commit torture and murder on real humans.  (5K RUS, 10K EUR, 25K AMR -- I found it a bit ironic that killing an American cost the most, probably because most of the world hates Americans)<br /><br />I really loved the way the film corresponded the sleazier sites of Amsterdam (peep-rooms and streets of prostitutes) and utilized it for the titillating grotesqueries inside the warehouse.  Drill bits, hammers, scissors, metal claws, shackles, chainsaws, guns, and hooks.  Chains with hooks are cool.  It doesn't matter if its fishhooks ala Hellraiser or heavy-duty cargo hooks like Ghost Ship; chains and hooks are a meaty favorite of the true horror fan.<br /><br />Our antiseptic society also craves some nice filth to go with our gore.  There is plenty sludge and muck in 'Hostel'; dirty walls and backed up drains and grimy, stinky goo.  There are rubber gloves, rubber aprons, rubber boots, filthy tools, and cart full of bloody bodies.<br /><br />Some additional niceties worth mentioning are the street urchins, a bit of automotive revenge, a toilet swirly, the chainsaw finger removal (finger chopping with a chainsaw is much tastier than with a knife) and a very satisfactory ending for the revenge bug in all of us.<br /><br />I also got a kick out of the janitorial service.  How would you like to clean up that place ... daily?  Of course, methinks the janitors were slackers, it was still messy when they were finished.<br /><br />For those who like their horror slippery with blood and touched with insanity, 'Hostel' is a must have.  Definitely worth a purchase.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

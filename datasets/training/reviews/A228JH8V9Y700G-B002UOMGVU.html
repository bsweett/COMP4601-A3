How could you not respect a masterpiece of this calaber?<br /><br />Good Fellas is the story of Henry Hill, the most famous turncoat in Mafia history.  At the tender age of 13 as a smartass kid in New York, he becomes an errand boy for his local mob club, to climb the ladder to spend 30 years on the inside.  His jealousy is obvious, as he, like Jimmy "The Gent" cannot be officially made because they have Irish blood.  But he copes and learns to never rat on his friends and keep his mouth shut.  Henry becomes greedy, as he delves deeper into cocaine addiction, lying to and cheating the very people who taught him everything he knew.  When he has hit rock bottem and realizes that his colleges are going to turn him in, Henry turns state's evidence and turns them all in.  He would spend the next few years in the Witness Protection Program, but emerged after seven years to become a pseudo celebrity.  He even has his own website now.<br /><br />What appeals to us so much about a movie about the Mafia is that there is no struggle against good and evil, it's all evil.  None of these people (save for the police) are the "good guys", and none of them are really "good fellas".  They spend their lives skirting the law, contributing to America's drug problem, and profiting off of otherwise honest people.  And yet they live like kings.  Snap your fingers and you have everything: money, women, power, prestige, material things, etc.  And at the end, Henry says the worst part is having to live like an ordinary shnook.  He shows no remorse for what he's done.  But then again, if we had that kind of life, would we?</p></body></html>

Jennifer is great in her role as Jenna.  It was also nice to see Mark Ruffalo (I've never seen him in any movie other than this..I like him now, he's great) This has a lesson to it: If you wish for something, you might get it..and then you may come to the realization that it's not what you really want.  I've seen the comparisons to other movies, but I do think this has some unique qualities this time around.  See this, it's a nice, light story to fill the heart.</p></body></html>

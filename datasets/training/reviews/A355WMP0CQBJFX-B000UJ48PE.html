<meta name="summary" content="THIS IS WHY THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME."></head><body><p>whoo, talk about taking gore to the next level. hostel II is right up there with the first hostel. this one was horribly good. i mean this one took you beyond the torture. it took you to meet the creator, you were introduced to the home of all this, and made you watch a live human auction take place. all that was missing in the first they gave it to you in the second. now instead of the boys, they brought in the girls. shows you that no one is safe. women being more vunerable, are placed in the same situation, but they too can kick azz as well as anybody else when the time arises. hostel II made you look even when you wanted to turn away. some of the killin scenes were very intense. you knew what was coming, but with every passing second the fear grew and grew. it makes you think which is worse...the torture of waiting for the unknown or the torture itself. we all know what's going to happen, but we don't know to who, or when. who will escape, will any of them, and will they bring down this whole horrific ring of torture. three american girls are targeted as the next victims for the infamous torture factory. unknown to them, they have already reserved a seat for death. all they want to do is explore, have fun, be girls. then they meet a model from around the area, she's the bait, and lures them in. one by one they disappear. what fate awaits them? you get a better look at how things work, a more in depth look at the torture, and you are left in awe at the way these people are treated like cattle. no feelings are involved on behalf of the people that are hustling these victims. very cold hearted. the end is a good one. unexpected really, but just shows when on the line of life and death you fight and you do what you have to. kind of makes you think and ask does money really make the world go round. the actors all did very well. the chics were pretty good. one shy, heather matarazzo, good actress. one party girl, bijou phillips, played it well, and the star lauren german, plays beth, the stable one, brings out her character and really tries to fight back. she should really be on the rise. this is why you don't go to places where you don't know what the deal is. nothing better than what you know. pure success in this film.</p></body></html>

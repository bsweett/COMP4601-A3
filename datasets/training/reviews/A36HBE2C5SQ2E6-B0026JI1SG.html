<meta name="summary" content="One of the best of Clint Eastwood's direction."></head><body><p>Joe(Eastwood)is a cut man, he has been old school even when the new school was in, He owns a boxing gym, and he has lost his best fighter. Maggie(Swank)is a 31 year old woman boxer that is considered too old to box, put down by her family that she won't make it, she works out at Joe's gym every day for 6 months to prove to Joe that she can work, and work hard. She is full of determination and she works hard for Joe. He gets her a title fight, and then a tragic accident occurs, and Joe has to do something that is not what he wants to do.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is a master director. He can be compared to Martin Scorsase, Stanley Kurbrick, and whoever else, and hold his own with them. I loved Morgan Freeman in this, I felt this was his best work since The Shawnshank Redemption and Unforgiven. The newcomer to the bunch, Hilary Swank, pulls off a stunningly powerful performance and deserves a oscar for it. The film itself, is a beautiful, and astonishing masterwork. Clint Eastwood's direction is brillant, He can really get the best out of his actors.<br /><br />I really liked this film, and I hope to enjoy it in the future. It was one of the best of last year, and it deserves any oscars or awards that it gets because it rightfully deserves them.</p></body></html>

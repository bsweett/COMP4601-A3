<meta name="summary" content="Not the worst however Not the best movie  I have seen..."></head><body><p>This movie was a movie I had seen limited previews for so I was going into blindly which tends to work well for most movies.  However, this movie was lacking passion and power.  The effects were cool but the plot was just blah.  Personally, I would hold off on watching this movie until video or find it when it hits your cheap theater as it is not worth $7.  Two much was going on that was taking away from the movie that could have been.  Go to one of the other movies out right now such as 40 Year Old Virgin or Must Love Dogs.</p></body></html>

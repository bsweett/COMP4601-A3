Walk The Line is without a doubt one of the best films of the year, not just because it brings the tempestuous life of one of country music's greats to the screen, but also because it serves as an outstanding star vehicle for Joachim Phoenix as Cash and Reece Witherspoon as June Carter. Both are absolutely astounding in their respective roles - expect Oscar nominations for both.<br /><br />Director James Mangold has made a rousing movie about Cash and also about Carter, the woman destined to be his wife and his soul mate. It's a movie that resounds with emotions, from heartache, to pain, and to love, with the themes of family dysfunction, the battle for survival, drug abuse, and the triumph of the underdog magically reverberating throughout. There's neither a misstep nor a moment wasted in this enormously entertaining film, which magically combines the elements of foot-stomping musical, powerful backstage drama, and touching human love story.<br /><br />Walk The Line begins as Cash is about to give his famous concert to the inmates of Folsom Prison. As he's getting ready to walk on stage, the story flashes back to Arkansas  in 1944, where the younger Johnny (Ridge Canipe) is  living in the shadow of his smart, generous older brother, a preacher-to-be and the focus of his sharecropping family's hopes. When the golden boy is killed in a freak accident, their father (Robert Patrick) blames Johnny, screaming at him "The Devil did this! He took the wrong one!"<br /><br />Mangold's subtle and intelligent screenplay argues that it was perhaps his dysfunctional relationship with his father, that led Cash to have many of the emotional problems that plagued his later life, and that his search for fame and a career, was perhaps the result of trying to redeem some of the love that he so desperately needed from his family, especially from his drunken and abusive father.<br /><br />Desperate to get away, Johnny joins the airforce and his stationed in Germany. It is here that he buys his first guitar and starts to compose his songs. He returns home to Memphis and marries Vivian (a terrific Ginnifer Goodwin), who has big dreams of a prosperous and happy family life in the suburbs with their children. But Johnny is bored and frustrated; he'd rather be writing music - and he can't wait to ditch his life as a door-to door salesman.<br /><br />He cobbles together a band with a few friends and they audition for Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts) of Sun Records who is not too impressed with their badly sung gospel tunes. After he challenges Johnny to make him believe what he is saying in his lyrics, Cash delivers a heartfelt song he wrote about being down and out. Phillips signs the band as Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two.<br /><br />But it is the meeting with June Carter (Witherspoon) backstage at a concert that really changes Cash's life.  The daughter of the legendary Mother Maybelle Carter, she has grown up as a member of country music royalty. Not equipped with the vocal talent of her sisters, she has become a stage comedian known for her spunk and ability to reach the hearts of an audience with her charm and wit. Johnny is immediately attracted to her, but there's a snag: he's married, and soon she is too.<br /><br />As Cash fame grows, he quickly develops a dependence upon amphetamines, using them to help him get through the pressures of touring, sleeping with the girls who so obviously adore him, creating new songs and albums, and assuaging his guilt over not spending enough time with his wife and daughters. June, is obviously enamored of him, and loves him dearly, but all she can really do is watch on as the country singer grows ever more self-destructive. Call it a type of tough love.<br /><br />But it is only through ten years of friendship with June, that Cash is finally able to see the light, and come to terms with his past, his Catholicism, and the emotional demons that have haunted him for so many years. The film is so exquisitely crafted, and full of such powerful moments that viewers will not help but fully appreciate the tender love that blossoms between Johnny and June. She helps him see his true worth, and he draws out her songwriting talent, which culminates in the classic Ring of Fire.<br /><br />Much has been made of the fact that both Reece and Joaquin do their own singing, and this certainly adds an element of immediacy and authenticity to the proceedings, which would not have otherwise been captured. Phoenix is utterly compelling as Cash, his performance digs deep, burrowing utterly into his character's wounded soul; he doesn't just mimic Cash he is Cash! Phoenix is both frightening and pathetic, especially in the periods where he's high on drugs; he gives a totally brave and terrifyingly real performance.<br /><br />Witherspoon shows us how Carter used her perky stage presence to disguise her repeated romantic disappointments. Girlish one moment and steely-smart the next, she offers exactly the sort of mixture of tough love and bruising tenderness that Cash so desperately needed.<br /><br />When both Witherspoon and Phoenix sing together, the screen lights up with a vibrancy and energy that is totally awe-inspring and also heartbraking. Walk The Line is not only a crowning achievement for both of these talented actors, but it's also a marvelous celebration of two soulmates who eventually find one another in a hard-won and richly deserved happy ending.

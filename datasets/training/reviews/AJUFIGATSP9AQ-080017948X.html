<meta name="summary" content="Available Without a Prescription"></head><body><p>Irritable? Frustrated? Bored or depressed? Here's the cure; in an unassuming comedy about Murray's Phil Conners, the Weatherman, who solves those problems when he relives the same day over and over. Seminal film transcends comedy, romance, fantasy and  spirituality; working as an attitude adjuster filled with healthy belly laughs. Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliot and twice Murrays are shining with every extra.<br />If you had a day to live ; would you be very good or very bad? Phil tries it all; for worse and better. This is a Sci-fi Horror, Comedy Drama with a boogaloo beat and it will aid in all moods.<br /><br />Recommended dose: 1-2 a year.<br />BD is full strength. All versions are OK. BD better, clear and powerful. Best taken with a meal.</p></body></html>

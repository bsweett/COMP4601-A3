<meta name="summary" content="Real Horror"></head><body><p>If you are looking for an interesting, original horror movie this is the one for you.  This is not your typical movie at all.<br /><br />There are no stars and Duane Jones (Ben) is the only substantial character (other than catatonic Barbara played by Judith O'Dea).  It was shot on a shoestring budget (estimated at a little over $100,000) around Pittsburgh, PA.<br /><br />The movie starts swiftly and emerges the audience without any warning into a nightmarish world.  The quick pace of the film makes it easy to watch, and the intensity of it all--gripping the edge of your seat to see what happens next--totally captivates.<br /><br />This movie is truly enjoyable.  In the original black and white, it is an eerie film, not gory or gruesome.  It is terrifying.<br /><br />This edition also comes with the colorized version, which is not bad, but just strange (some colors are so vibrant and intense it shifts the mood of the scene, meanwhile other colors are paled or grayed and actually enhance the feeling of the scene).  Watch it in black and white first, and then try it in color.<br /><br />Either way, this film is a must see for horror fans.<br /><br />One of my personal favorites!</p></body></html>

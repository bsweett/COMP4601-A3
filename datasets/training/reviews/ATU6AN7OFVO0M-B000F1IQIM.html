<meta name="summary" content="Why Can't They Just create a realistic hero?"></head><body><p>Let's not say that this movie is a sequel to the mighty "Desperado" and face it as an Individual, new movie. well, it's better that way cause this movie can not be in any way compared with the original! As only an action movie, It wasn't that bad but...<br /><br />1. They've shown mexico as an extremely primitive country, just like one of central or south american tiny republics. everyone knows Mexico although is not a modern country, but it's not that primitive too. they always show Desolated primitive northern states as entire mexico. it's an insult to mexican people! Is U.s. Arizona, New Mexico or parts of Texas better than mexican northern provinces? I guess not! Mexico City is a city with more than 10 million population! and It's a modern city! It's not right to show our neighbours primitive on purpose!<br /><br />2. What's this Mariachi? Superman? Spiderman? Batman? I guess he soppose to be more real than a comic hero. most of his efforts could be end up unright! a person can be lucky and survive one time, possitively, two times! but not each time. I don't know why can't they just get rid of that "Comicism (I made this term myself!)" in their mind and create a realistic hero that children and youth can try to be like him with some effort and doing some sports! the mariachi I saw here, was a Superhuman!<br /><br />Anyway, this is a good action movie for one night. at least it makes you less nervous than some similar movies! it has a good and reasonable story, great visuals and great actings. oh, buy the way, let's have a word about blind Jhonny Depp in this movie too! He sopposed to be blind. a Sudden Untrained blind. so how could he accomodate himself with new condition and became a "Laegendary like" warrior in less than an hour? and what was he looking at with no eyes? If he tried to act like a real blind man, it was a fair try!</p></body></html>

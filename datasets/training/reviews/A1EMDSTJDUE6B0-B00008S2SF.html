<meta name="summary" content="Typical, But Good Enough"></head><body><p>This was typical of many summer blockbusters, but it fell below par for most James Bond films. Like other summer films, there were too many scenes of unnecessary explosions (too obviously contrived), pedantic sensuality and loudness. I enjoy those things when they are done well -- they just were not done very well here. However, the movie gets back on track to the plot just in time to keep you watching it. Not the best Bond flick nor the best Brosnan one, but not the worst either.</p></body></html>

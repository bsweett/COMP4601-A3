<meta name="summary" content="Blows WTC Out of the Water"></head><body><p>`World Trade Center' was, unfortunately, the first of the two 9/11 based films I was able to see this year.  I was so unimpressed with WTC (aside from Maggie Gyllenhaal's wonderful performance) that I almost (and I stress almost) forfeited watching this film.  I'm so glad I rethought that idea.  This has to be one of the most touching and emotionally nerve racking movies I've seen in recent years and is such a triumph for movie making in general.  A lot of people were distressed since it has only been five years since the horrible events that circle this film, but when done as tastefully and as honestly as `United 93' we should be able to look passed our bias and embrace it for the tribute it truly is.<br /><br />Approaching the attack without bias was the one thing that truly impressed me about this film, for it showed both sides of the coin.  While yes, what was done was one of the most horrific acts our country has had to endure this film also gave us a look at the attackers who, while committing a horrible crime were not doing anything wrong in their own eyes.  There were many scenes that showed these men as they came close to their attack, the concern and the worry in their eyes, the panic.  They were scared, very scared.<br /><br />I don't want that to sound as if I condone what they've done because I don't, I just appreciate the way this film honestly portrayed the `villains' sort-of-speak instead of making them appear heartless and confident they appeared scared and panic-ridden.  It's a very commendable thing on the part of Greengrass.  Another smart move was having the film star almost no recognizable faces, so when we are watching this film we feel as though we are watching life, not a movie.  We can't say "oh Brad Pitt won't die" or "I just saw Kate Winslet talking to Oprah about how hard it was to film that scene"...all we can do is watch in horror as these unrecognizable faces deal with the unbelievable.  It's one of those movies, where even though you know the outcome your frustrated with everyone on board hoping they'll do something else, anything else to deliver a happy ending.<br /><br />No, this is far from a feel good film.  It will make you cry, it will make you proud (proud that we have people around us who are selfless enough to try and save others) and it will make you pray that nothing like this ever happens again.  One of the greatest achievements in cinema this year, `United 93' is a must see film!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="the break up..."></head><body><p>I found myself relating to this movie.  It was funny to me. The ending was great.<br /><br />One couple, one condo, and one break up equals fighting without end.  Boyfriend takes girl for granted, girlfriend says things she doesn't mean equals break up.<br /><br />This is not a family movie because of language and some content.</p></body></html>

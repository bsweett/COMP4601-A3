<meta name="summary" content="Weird, unsettling and magnificent!"></head><body><p>This is, hands down, without a doubt, one of the strangest damn movies I have ever seen. Unsettling and weird and wonderful and fantastic.<br /><br />The plot is simple: a man, Daniel Plainview, steamrollers over everyone and everything in his path in order to get oil, and thereby, money and power. There's a great many comparisons that can be made between this character and Charles Foster Kane (and if you haven't seen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9E">Citizen Kane (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, do so), the primary difference being that Kane at least was somewhat likable. The best you can say for Plainview is that he is, at times, pitiable.<br /><br />Mostly the movie is a character study, pitting Plainview against a young preacher, Eli Sunday. His church is called The Church of the Third Revelation, which if you're a smart-a$$ like me tells you everything you need to know about who he is and what he does. Suffice to say that in modern times he'd have big hair, a bad suit and the ability to cry/plead for money on cue whenever a TV camera is on him.<br /><br />It's very hard to describe this movie beyond what I've said, at least as far as the plot goes. The cinematography is mind-blowing and the music is... well, effective. There's a weird sound that plays over the soundtrack from time to time. It sounds rather like an air-raide siren if you only played out the first note of it and then didn't stop.<br /><br />It is one of the most memorable and effective films I've ever seen. It's very hard to watch at times, but entirely worth it, if for no other reason than Daniel Day-Lewis' performance.<br /><br />One last note: whomever thought this was a good idea for DVD packaging needs to be smacked, cause it totally isn't. Green, yes, but very stupid. Some sort of plastic to at least hold the discs in place would've been nice, but, oh, well.</p></body></html>

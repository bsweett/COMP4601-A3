It was one of the most thrilling movies of all time, sure, but it showed a true mastery of the medium: the pace of the movie, by and large, is slow, but it creates such an unforgettable atmosphere of dread and paranoia that you had your eyes glued to the screen for every second. The original Manchurian Candidate was excellently written and acted, and really funny--it really holds up after 40 years. When I heard it was going to be remade, I was a tad concerned, but finding out that it was going to be helmed by Demme and have a cast headlined by Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep, etc., I was understandably excited by the possibility. The themes of political treachery and paranoia could be well applied to the terrorist age, and I was anxious to see a different director's vision of this story. I had high expectations, but the end result turned out to be, well, average.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the acting is superb. Denzel is in top form, cast against type, playing the Sinatra role in a considerably more haunted manner than the Chairman did. Liev Schreiber channels Lawrence Harvey and proves capable of taking over Harvey's classic performance. Meryl Streep, it goes without saying, is great. Jon Voight, though, gives probably the most balanced performance of the film, as a Senator who has to juggle idealism with pragmatism learned by hard experience--it's quite an accomplishment, and rings true in this age of the 'axis of evil'. Although this film didn't get any acting nods come Oscar time, it did have fierce competition, and in another year it just might have. The problem is the screenplay. If you haven't seen the original, you might imagine that this is a smart, satirical political thriller. However, if you look up the definition of those words in the dictionary, you will find the movie poster for the original incarnation of this movie. It's a tall order to remake one of the best American--heck, Earth--films of all time, and it might be unfair to criticize the movie by comparing it to the immortal source, but it is inevitable upon an undertaking like this, so here goes.<br /><br />Little of what made the original film special is present here. The comic unreality of the brainwashing scenes is replaced with standard-level atrocities, the humor is replaced with such grimness that the movie draws you in easily, but it is hard to enjoy. I saw it with two rather smart people (I'm no dunce myself), and none of us could completely figure out the contradictory motivations of some of the characters, or the message of the movie. It's obviously an indictment of corporate power politics, but that is so obvious that I just imagined there had to be something more to it. The original was an indictment of McCarthy-era politics, but it also did so much more: for example, people are likely to stick with a President if something horrible happened during their term, regardless of whose fault it was. This isn't a Bush metaphor, although it applies, but the same thing happened to FDR. The message of political assassination for promotion is still provocative, since many people still believe that LBJ was in on the JFK assassination. To paraphrase Pauline Kael, that movie has some of the most sophisticated political satire ever committed to the screen. The new movie has some of the most obvious political satire ever committed to the screen: Corporations want more power? There are power-crazy people in Washington? More breaking news: there's a military-industrial compex that doesn't want peace so that they can keep their jobs, and the media is obsessed with ratings instead of being our check against power. I take a more optimistic picture of our government than the movie does, so its dripping cynicism doesn't quite hit home for me. Ultimately, Demme deserves credit for not doing a shot-to-shot remake of the original, but this movie shows how hard it is to recreate a classic movie that's just as memorable. Now, before they remake Casablanca with Ben Affleck, Owen Wilson and Natalie Portman, we should probably let the studios know that remakes are ten times harder to pull off than an original film, especially if the original is a classic, and that if they're hell-bent on remaking films, they should use bad ones so that the new ones look good by comparison. I'm thinking Ed Wood here, how about Glen or Glenda with Joaquin Phoenix and one of the Desperate Housewives? I'd sure go to see that one, and I do trust film executives to come up with a movie that's better than one of the worst of all time, but not much more.</p></body></html>

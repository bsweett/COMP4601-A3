<meta name="summary" content="Lest we forget...."></head><body><p>The premise of this story is quite fresh & original, I think.  Have you ever had a love affair with someone that went bad?  Have you ever wished that you could simply forget about it, so that you would no longer have to endure the pain?  Have you thought that life would be simpler & easier if you could move on without ever having to "look back"?<br /><br />The present film takes that concept & runs with it.  The title is an allusion to Alexander Pope and it refers to the "spotless mind" of someone who has been "wiped clean" of painful memories of love.  Thanx to a new technology, it is at last possible to kiss goodbye your recall of the proverbial "one that got away."<br /><br />Of course, the $60,000 question is:  is this a good thing?  After all, our memories are part of our personality makeup;  they make us who we are.  This is true of both good & bad memories.  Is it not dangerous to try & be selective about what we remember?<br /><br />Such is the outline of the story that this movie addresses.  It ends up being a cross between a Drama and Romantic Comedy (it has some VERY funny scenes).<br /><br />Jim Carrey continues on his quest that he can do more than slapstick comedy, and he does a credible job.  This is a very different role for Kate Winslett.  Normally she portrays characters who are subdued & rational.  In this film, her character is flakey, impulsive and (somehow?) endearing.<br /><br />If you are in the market for a great date movie, this one is worth a look. It is also cathartic for people who have ever entertained the notion that it's better to forget than to remember.</p></body></html>

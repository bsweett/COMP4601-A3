<meta name="summary" content="Asperger's Syndrome, or just genius?"></head><body><p>This is the story of John Forbes Nash, Jr. (Russell Crowe), a brilliant mathematician and economist who did amazing original work. My own diagnosis of him during the early part of the movie was Asperger's Syndrome, but eventually the diagnosis of schizophrenia is fully justified. Until we get pretty far into the story, the audience doesn't know any more than Dr. Nash does about what is real and what is hallucination. So having given that tiny clue, amuse yourself by trying to guess. Chances are you will be at least partly wrong.<br /><br />But as the movie also makes clear, a brilliant mind is not proof against mental illness, and indeed may be at least part of the cause. It might be interesting to look up some statistics on that, but not right now. Right now the important thing is one woman (Jennifer Connolly) loved him, and stood by him when his illness caused them both a great deal of trouble. She earned the right to be dressed to the nines and sit in an auditorium in Stockholm, applauding and glowing with pride as he was awarded the Nobel Prize for economics. It was for the work he had done long ago, which turned out to have practical implications beyond what even he had considered.<br /><br />It's a very real, very compassionate look at what can go wrong in even a beautiful mind. Maybe even, as I said, more often in a beautiful mind than an ordinary one. Five stars, although at least one of them is for my sense of kinship with Dr. Nash.</p></body></html>

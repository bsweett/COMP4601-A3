While in New York, he  sees "Baywatch" on TV and vows to go to California and marry Pamela Anderson.  Off he goes across the country, meeting (and insulting) various groups along the way, including Jews, Christians, animal lovers, rodeo fans, fine diners, a doctor, and just about anyone else you can imagine.  The vignettes were shot with real people, a la <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIWHEI">Candid Camera</a>, who react to the outrageous words and actions of the guileless and amazingly coarse Borat.<br /><br />I'd heard that this movie was outrageous and vulgar and insulting and it certainly is - and also the funniest movie I can remember seeing.  I laughed non-stop (while shaking my head in wonder at Borat's "victims":  Why would they sign releases to let their footage appear in the movie?).<br /><br />Borat never breaks character and keeps the joke up right to the end.  His pride in his run-down country is sweet and his innocence is what makes the movie work.  In the Extras, Borat appears on "The Tonight Show"...<br /><br />Jay Leno: "What do you say to people who say your movie is homophobic and anti-Semitic?"<br /><br />Borat:  "Thank you!"<br /><br />You'll either love it or think it's the most vulgar and offensive movie ever made.  I loved it.</p></body></html>

This film, based on the Stephen King bestseller, is  Frank Darabont's best film along with THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. Tom Hanks,  Michael Clarke Duncan, Barry Pepper, James Cromwell, Bonnie Hunt, Gary  Sinise, and many other fine and talented stars headline this masterpiece.  At first, I thought this film would be a flop. But, thanks to word of  mouth, the film grossed $136 Million domestically. I personally think it  should have done better than that. This, along with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, is  Tom Hanks'  best performance. The visual effects, although there aren't  many, are dazzling. The relationships between the the actors is at times  sad, and at times funny. The mix of comedy, drama, fantasy, and mouse  hunting make it a film that certainly deserves to be on every movie fan's  top ten list of all time best movies. For a three hour movie with no very  exciting moments, it is really fast paced. The ending, although quite sad,  is still a happy one. Everybody who loves GREAT movies should see this.  Trust me, it will make your day. Bravo, Tom Hanks!</p></body></html>

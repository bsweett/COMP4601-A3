<meta name="summary" content="A magical partnership"></head><body><p>In this wonderfully inventive film, director Martin Scorsese incorporates two different genres into one great story.  The first half of the film deals with a young boy who is orphaned and adopted by his drunken Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone).  Claude is responsible for keeping all of the clocks wound and in proper working order at a huge Paris train station.  Young Hugo (Asa Butterfield) learns how to do this and after his uncle disappears, manages to keep the clocks working.  He lives where he works deep in the belly of the station.  The only thing Hugo has from his father (Jude Law in flashbacks) is a robotic like machine called an automatron.  Since the inner workings of the machine function much like a windup clock, Hugo is constantly trying to get it to function again.  This requires guile, skill and stealing parts.  One of Hugo's victims is the owner of a trinket shop.  This grouchy old man named George is played by Ben Kingsley.  George and his wife however are the Godparents of another young orphan named Isabelle (Chloe Moretz).  She and Hugo create a bond and get into mischief and eventually detective work.  Both are enamored by magic and George was once a great magician as it turns out.  This set up segues to another creative style in which we discover that George is actually famed movie pioneer George Melies.<br /><br />Scorsese is one of the great film historians in addition to being an iconic director and puts in much time and effort into presenting Melies contribution to film.  He was instrumental in giving the new medium a sense of illusion.  Magic and trickery?  Of course.  Movies and magic.  Melies grumpiness is mostly attributed to his departure from the industry after WW I.  The reason is unclear, although the public's lack of interest as suggested seems overstated.  Hugo sets out to bring George the attention he deserves, if many years later.  He enlists the help of a film expert who knows Melies' work but believed he had died years earlier.  The ending is sweet and predictable but also a perfect conclusion to a magical film.  I saw this film in 3-D which was some of the best work this "trickery" has to offer.  A perfect partnership.<br /><br />The Blu ray version of this film is equal to the quality or the original.  The 1080p transfer is shown with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio and frankly leaves nothing to be desired.  The film is enjoyable and full of visual treats.  This is reference quality as it the remarkable DTS-HD MA 7.1 soundstage.  This entire disc is demo quality, so keep it handy to show your friends.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great potential..."></head><body><p>This unusual feature film seems to have come directly from the offices of Chris Carter. (Millennium, The X Files) When first seeing the previews, I thought, considering the talent, Julianne Moore and Gary Sinese, that this would be a disturbing though sophisticated psychological thriller, a woman haunted from repressed memories, revealing, in the end, a traumatic and evil event. Remembering this past event would be terribly dangerous for her, culminating in a white-knuckle climax. What I didn't expect was this kind of film - a quasi science fictional tale, which, for the most part, leaves the viewer unsatisfied.<br /><br />The performances were all first rate. Julianne Moore is an excellent actress and Gary Sinese as the concerned therapist, although a small role, delivered his usual high standard work. However these fine actors are wasted on a script that was not thought through... perhaps this sounded like a great idea in fifty words or less, pitched to the movie executives over a long, liquid lunch, but the final product misses something, and that is a movie which had the potential to be great and ended up being mediocre.<br /><br />It is impossible to write about this film without giving too much away, though to be fair, a few scenes that used special effects, particularly those characters literally being whisked away into the sky, was quite impressive.<br /><br />There is so much one can do with the notion of memory, false memory and lost memory, in a fictional tale. A great film that comes to mind is the 90's thriller, Memento, directed and written by Christopher Nolen, starring Guy Pearce as the amnesiac and avenger of his wife's killer. This was a clever film that had the audience guessing from beginning to end.<br /><br />The Forgotten starts compellingly, with Telly Parada (Julianne Moore) struggling to cope with the loss of her 9-year old son. In the first ten minutes of the story, mementos such as photos and videos of the boy start to go missing, until every remnant of his existence vanishes. Is Telly delusional? Did she ever have a son? Her psychiatrist seems to think she's loosing her mind and her husband does as well. Telly won't give up, however, looking up another parent who has also lost a child in the same alleged plane crash. As the film progresses we are informed of the secret, and the story slowly becomes a silly moral tale about the indestructible bonds between mother and child.<br /><br />This is one of those films that has a great director, extraordinary talent, a suspenseful soundtrack and great special effects, unfortunately set against a script that would have been rejected by Chris Carter of the X Files as too silly to be even considered.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Arguably the best Sci-fi film since BLADE RUNNER"></head><body><p>This is the most satisfying blockbuster film that I have seen in a long, long time. In my opinion, this is not just the best major release of the year so far, but the best film Steven Spielberg has made in a long time, and maybe ever. <p>In my opininon, this is also the best Sci-fi film since BLADE RUNNER. It could have been even better, but the last twenty or so minutes of the film just aren't as outstanding as the rest of the film. It isn't that the ending is bad; it just doesn't stay at the exhilarating level of the rest of the film.<p>There are just so many great things about this movie it is hard to focus on even a few. I'll try.<p>First, the film is visually stunning. I don't know if the cinematographer used a filter to give the film a grainy texture or if they did something to the film in developing it (it was filmed in Technicolor using Panavision Lenses, so it was not filmed using digital), but the film has a washed out, grainy look that is just perfect. There is a lot of computer animation, and tons of special effects, but they never detract from the film, and always seem to enhance the story. The sets are great, and it provides the best vision of what the future might look like since BLADE RUNNER. <p>Second, the imagined technological changes in the future are really compelling. The film shows everyone getting frequent eye scans, say by cameras over advertisements, which enable the ads to pitch their products directly to the person in question. Eye scanning plays a major role in the film, and leads to several of its best moments, both tense, scary scenes, and in funny, tension-breaking moments. There are some great shots with mechanical spiders that run through a building (one of the best sets I have seen in quite a while, with a lot of sky lights that allow you to view much of the action from overhead). One of the best moments in the film occurs when Tom Cruise is trying to avoid these spiders by immersing himself in a tub of ice.<p>Third, while I know Tom Cruise is not popular with most guys (including me), he is very good in this one. I have to say, this has to be my favorite Tom Cruise flick, by far. Most of the actors were quite good. Spielberg has sometimes had problems in the past casting the best people for key roles, but that wasn't a problem at all in this film. Colin Farrell was very good as an operative for the US Attorney General, and most of the actors in the Pre-Crime division were very compelling. But the best person besides Cruise was, by far, Samantha Morton as Agatha, the most talented and important of the three Pre-Cognitives who anticipate the murders that will be committed in the future. She provides a very large number of the most intense moments in the film, and some chase scenes that take place with her are just incredible. There is one moment in particular when she stops what she is saying in a subdued voice suddently to scream "Run!" that is one of the best moments in the film (don't worry, you won't be able to anticipate when she yells it). The Swedish actor Peter Stomare (who played the insane murderer in FARGO, one of the "nihilists" in THE BIG LEBOWKSI, and the abusive husband in CHOLOLAT, among other roles) has an especially nice if small role as a shady surgeon.<p>This film is so different from Spielberg's other films that if you didn't already know he was the director, you wouldn't be able to tell from watching it. It is bleak, metaphysical, inventive, exciting, provocative, philosophical, and entertaining. A good deal of this derives from the story by the always brilliant though consistently unpolished work of Philip K. Dick, who provides a moral and metaphysical complexity usually missing from Spielberg's universe. The only weak link in the film is when the film transitions from a metaphysical conundrum to a whodunit. Like I hinted above, it doesn't become a bad film; it just ceases to be one of the best films ever made. Had the ending been as strong as the rest of it, it might have laid claim to be the best Sci-fi film of all time.</p></body></html>

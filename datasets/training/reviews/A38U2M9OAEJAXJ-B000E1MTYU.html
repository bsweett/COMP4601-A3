All things considered, I had every right to expect this movie to be a bust.  Not only did James Cameron (who directed the first two "Terminator" movies) bow out, but his ex-wife and star Linda Hamilton also said "hasta la vista, baby" to "T3."  Linda Hamilton's role as Sarah Connor was a crucial element to the first two "Terminator" films, and without her, my faith headed south.  But thanks to director Jonathan Mostow, he makes "Terminator 3" a worthy sequel that doesn't come across as a desperate attempt to give Arnold Schwarzenegger a hit.  Like "T2," Arnold plays a "good" terminator on a mission to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl) against the relentlessly evil terminatrix TX (a wonderfully icy Kristianna Loken).  "T3" lacks the groundbreaking punch of its last two films, and Stahl comes off as a bit bland as John Connor, but the film overall succeeds as an above-average action flick.  Special effects-wise, there's nothing to write home about, but there are a few scenes that will have you hooked to the screen, including an extended car chase that's downright ugly.  It's also not afraid to make fun of itself by recycling one-liners like "she'll be back," "I'll be back," and "talk to the hand."  I can't say that "T3" will go down as one of the great action movies and I'm also not sure I would want to see a "T4," but it definitely exceeded my expectations.</p></body></html>

Hopefully I'll be around a long, long time, but you just never know. This is an enjoyable movie with a more than capable cast especially in the two leads. I can watch these guys in just about anything, and Freeman could recite the phone book and I would listen.<br /><br />The movie is kept on a comedic level through most of the story, probably because we would be crying all the way through this film if it weren't! Believe me you will shed a tear before it ends, but through the middle of the film, I found a lot of the "Bucket List" "high jinks" to be rather artificial at times. The second half of the film is much better and it is also where it redeems itself. It's a good film with great actors that will hold your interest, but it's far from perfect. The DVD transfer is very good, the extra material is very sparse.</p></body></html>

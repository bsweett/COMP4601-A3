<meta name="summary" content="Cameron Diaz steals the show"></head><body><p>James Reid (Tom Wilkinson), newspaper owner and snot, gets a timely and deadly bee sting. This leaves his playboy son Britt (Seth Rogen) to run the show.  Seth in turn is looking for a good cup of coffee which introduces him to an inventor and martial arts coffy maker Kato (Jay Chou). Out of boredom Britt and Kato come up with the Green Hornet thing. Lacking direction they pilfer ideas from criminology student Lenore Case (Cameron Diaz). Will their plans be foiled by a real criminal Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz)? Or will they be able to accomplish their goal? And does anyone get the girl?<br /><br />Great Green Hornet movie. Seldom do we get a movie with a beginning and an ending to match. There is emotion, action and depth of character.  With the exception of some rap music, the background and filler music matched the scene and did not overwhelm the dialog. There are plenty of car chases and structural destruction; yet in all of the mayhem there we do not see gratuitous blood and guts (maybe a few suggestive bullet holes.) Cameron may have been a distraction at first; however when she got down to acting you enjoyed watching her character.<br /><br />On the DVD media (that I watched) itself there are the standard coming attractions before the film and plenty of fairly new Blu-ray gimmicks that are not relevant to the film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the best movies that I've ever seen!"></head><body><p>Beware for those of you wanting to watch an action/ sci-fi movie as this isn't like that. There isn't a lot of action whatsoever or not even that much suspense, but the movie is very interesting, exciting and unlike anything else that you've ever seen before.<br /><br />This movie is visually stunning and has a very powerful score that goes along with everything that's happening in the movie.<br /><br />This movie is definitely one of the best that I have ever seen.<br /><br />The movie is about a man waking up with a body next to him and not remembering anything from his past (complete memory loss) From then on, he's wanted for murder and hunted down by mysterious beings called strangers who can stop/control time. The title of the movie is clearly illustrated throughout the movie as there is basically no sun.<br /><br />I don't want to give away anything else about the movie so that you can discover this amazing movie on your own! Believe me, this is one movie that everyone should see. The plot and story of this movie is so remarquable and is probably the best and most interesting plot ever in a movie. This is a movie that you don't want to miss out on and is a treat to the audience thanks to its stunning visuals, remarquable plot, excellent music/score and great acting!</p></body></html>

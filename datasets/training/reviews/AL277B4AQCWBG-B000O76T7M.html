Call me crazy, but I kind of thought that was the whole point of this concept - bring together the two most vicious, sophisticated and entertaining monsters in cinema history and lock them in a room.  Anderson does give us that, kind of.  The "room" is a suitably creepy pyramid deep beneath Antarctica, and of course it contains the requisite clutch of human prey to be sequentially disemboweled and decapitated at a steadily increasing rate.  So why is it so boring?  Mainly because there's too much focus on the humans, and not enough on the bad guys we've all come out to see.  It doesn't help that the unifying story - the flimsy excuse for bringing everyone together - involves a once-in-a-hundred-years showdown and ritual human sacrifices.  Hose off the decorative archaeology and what it comes down to is this: once a century, the Aliens and Predators get together for the equivalent of a round of paintball in a purpose built fun park.  It gets worse: one of the humans - a tough-as-nails tomboy, of course - starts earning a Predator's respect.  You can guess how it goes from there: soaring music and big explosions as they reach out across the inter-species divide.  Whatever.  It's mildly diverting, but nothing you haven't seen before: a shame, when something striking and new - the realization of an irresistible "what if..." scenario - was precisely what this movie promised.  Ten years in development, you would've thought they could do better than this.  I would have settled for a 90-minute fight-fest in deep space pitting Aliens against Predators in situations where they needed all their disparate skills to survive.  No humans.  No dialogue.  We work it all out from the action itself.  A $65 million Hollywood digital movie told in the narrative grammar of silent film: now that's a once-in-a-hundred-years event I'd REALLY want to see.</p></body></html>

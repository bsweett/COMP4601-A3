<meta name="summary" content="Wow"></head><body><p>Take a classic action hero years removed from his action days, a cast of people who have never acted in a movie before, an experienced director and a cleverly plotted and written picture and you get a classic.<br /><br />Gran Torino works on every level.  Eastwood absolutely shines as a old vet and autoworker who has two great pleasures in his life, his wife whose funeral begins the movie and his Gran Torino.  As Detroit changes and falls apart and the neighbors are increasingly Hmong he refuses to move despite all the prompts from his family.<br /><br />Even better than Eastwood's performance is Ahney Her playing Sue Lor the girl next door whose brother becomes both the foe, then the friend of old man Kowalski.  Christopher Carley in his supporting role as the young parish priest also shines.<br /><br />Unlike <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002G1K82Q">Across the Universe</a> you get an actual sense of the cost of violence and war and what it can do to an individual and a community.  It's a movie that actually has meaning.<br /><br />Eastwood's direction isn't pretentious, it doesn't overshadow the message of the film or the purpose of the characters.  It works with the audience instead of preaching to them.  That's why one of the reasons why with a budget 12 million less than Across the Universe it managed to make 300 million more.<br /><br />It's certainly worth $20 more.</p></body></html>

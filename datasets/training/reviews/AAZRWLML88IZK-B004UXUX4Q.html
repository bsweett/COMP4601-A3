<meta name="summary" content="The Descendants"></head><body><p>We kick off this week with an Oscar-winner, made by and starring previous Oscar-winners, and though The Descendants only took home one of the five trophies for which it was nominated, most still agree it's a thoughtful drama worth watching. Best Actor nominee George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer in Hawaii about to complete a significant family real estate deal when his wife suffers a boating accident that leaves her in a coma with no hope of waking. With his wife now hospitalized and on the verge of passing, Matt must reconnect with their two daughters, come to terms with the fact that his wife was unfaithful to him, and decide whether or not to go through with the land sale. Based on the novel of the same name by Kaui Hart Hemmings and directed by Academy Award-winner Alexander Payne, The Descendants is funny, moving, and beautifully acted. Shailene Woodley, playing Matt's older daughter, also deserves kudos and the supporting cast is solid all-around.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better than the TV Series"></head><body><p>When I was a kid I liked to watch "The Fugitive" episodes on TV.  It offered a unique scenario; an (innocent) escaped convict running from a persistent lawman goes from town to town meeting different people with different problems, challenges, asperations, etc.  By the time things are resolved in each episode, Inspector Girard is just close enough for Richard Kimble to flee to a new locale for a new episode.  The possibilities were endless because there were only two characters that were repeaters from one episode to the next.<br /><br />In the movie, this aspect was lost but, in its' place, a more exciting set of circumstances were explored.  The TV version of Richard Kimble was always looking for "the one-armed man" (OK, I guess there were THREE characters that appeared in some or all of the episodes).  However, he never got close enough until the end.  In the movie version, Dr. Richard Kimble is a man possessed and the innocent bystanders were incidental to the pursuit of finding the real killer.  Jettison the human interest stories and focus on the chasee being the chaser and we've got a real action movie.<br /><br />There is nary a dull moment throughout "The Fugitive" all of which is aided by a superb cast.  Tommy Lee Jones deservingly won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in his role as the Marshall in pursuit.  Harrison Ford produces his customary above average performance and a number of other characters add a lot as well.  The aura of suspense coupled with the search to solve a mystery leads to a great climax.<br /><br />This is one of those movies you stick with when channel surfing.  As good as the TV version was, I recall that I listened to a Twins game the night of the final episode.  Fortunately the scoreboard announced the outcome of the final episode (as well as the game) and the sportcasters relayed it to us listeners.  I think I would opt for the movie over the baseball game if the choice ever comes up.</p></body></html>

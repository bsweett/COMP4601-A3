<meta name="summary" content="All the mistakes of the book and some new ones"></head><body><p>This is the popular movie version of the second Harry Potter book.  Once again, popularity and quality are not related.  This movie has all of the flaws of the book (almost too many to count).  The major ones are:<br />Ron Weasly breaks his wand.  It is a hand-me-down.  But we know that wands choose their owners and a wizard should never use someone else's wand.<br />Magic users are completely ignorant of the muggle world.  One student cannot conceive of a poster where the pictures don't move.  Students have never heard of basketball.  Ron's dad works for the Ministry of Magic and yet is clueless as to how a bus stop works (and he works in London). (etc. etc.).<br />Muggles are not to learn that magic exists.  Hermione's parents visit Diaganon alley and they are both muggles.  How do they know their daughter is a witch?  How does any mixed parentage work if letting muggles know about magic is a horrible crime?<br />Apparently it is illegal to enchant anything that is of muggle origin.  I would love to know the &quot;magical origins&quot; of all of the objects populating the book.<br />The defense for the dark arts teacher is a complete buffoon and yet the wise heads of Hogwarts are completely fooled.<br />Hagrid has been wronged for many years (is he really 62?) and yet when his name is cleared there are no reparations or apologies.<br />Hogwarts is a center of magic but not the only place magic is done and yet they don't seem to be able to get a hold of any mandrake (there is no evidence that they even tried).<br />I still have been unable to figure out money in this world.  There is magical money, of which Harry has hordes, but it doesn't really seem to be good for anything (although the Weaslys don't have enough).  Harry stays with the Weaslys but never offers any help.  Muggle money is for muggles and Harry has none.  What is the magic money for (other than school supplies?).  We'll have to see how Rowling settles that (although I doubt she will).<p>Some changes were made to the plot in the first movie and I was curious how they would get resolved in this one.  they weren't.  Bad boy Malfoy has bought his way onto his house's Quiddich team by getting everyone new brooms.  Since a seeker is the most important player (the only one who can win a game) it seems unlikely that one can buy into that particular spot.  but wait!  Malfoy is already on the team and already a seeker (see the first movie).  It was a big deal that first year Potter was on the team and a seeker, but no big deal was made that first year Malfoy was on a team and a seeker.  Now we are just confused.  Did Malfoy buy his way onto the team as the new seeker in year two or was he already a seeker in year one?<br />I know special effects artists can get carried away with their craft but the sheer number of spiders in the woods is completely implausible.  There would be nothing but spiders.  They would have eaten all of the other inhabitants is there were as many as the movie shows.<br />But, mistakes aside, people like this film, or at least spent a lot of money on it.  No long novel can be fully made into a single movie, but it seemed like the choice of scenes to include was almost random.  One should really not waste one's time on this.</p></body></html>

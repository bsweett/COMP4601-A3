Here, in Apocalypto, we have an amazing story of human misery, love, loyalty, and valor. This movie is not for children as it would horrify and depress the living heck out of them, but it definitely is for adults; particularly those adults who wish to categorize and analyze our collective human experience. Our ancestors' lives brimmed with tragedy-plagued days such as these and many of these scenes are unforgettable.<br /><br />Most importantly, Apocalypto illustrates how foolish we are to be as obsessed over comparatively insignificant matters such as race, ethnicity, and culture. The hero here, Jaguar Paw, is a member of a different race, time, and culture than my own, yet this reviewer--and practically every other person who sees this film--cheered for his survival with dramatic intensity. This is due to our ability to relate to him at a level far deeper than that of race, sex, and class. All of us intrinsically feel a need to defeat forces of unscrupulous evil, and that is bigger than the superficial conditions placed upon us by our birth. What these small Mayan clans faced at that time was an apocalypse, and Jaguar Paw is a man we should all admire. I could not turn this one off and disagree with the other reviewers who criticized its ending. The final frames were fulfilling.</p></body></html>

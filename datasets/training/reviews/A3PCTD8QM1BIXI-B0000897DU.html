<meta name="summary" content="One of my favorite movies of 2002"></head><body><p>Even though 8 Mile can't touch Purple Rain or Krush Groove when it comes to music it was one of my favorite movies from last year. Like I said 8 Mile was clearly without a doubt one of the best movies of the previous year when it came to crowd pleasing. Director Curtis Hanson and screenwriter Scott Silver have tailor made a great first movie for Eminem. In his portrayl of Jimmy Smith Jr.,Eminem gives the charcter depth and while watching the film I didn't see Eminem, I saw Jimmy. Some of the film's best scenes invole no dialogue, scenes such as Jimmy writing and anazlying his surroundings are deep and give you a feel of what a rapper goes through trying to write hye lyrics. The supporting cast all give excellent performances Mehki Phifer who serves as Jimmy's main supporter contiunes to make star making movies. Omar Benson Miller as Sol and Evan Jones as Cheddar Bob provide a lot of comic relief. With the little screen time they are given Kim Basinger and Brittany Murphy do good as the female leads. The highlight of the film is truly the battle scenes though. I give the movie ***** stars.</p></body></html>

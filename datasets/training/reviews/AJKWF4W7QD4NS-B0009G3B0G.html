<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly good"></head><body><p>Despite it's somewhat flawed visual style, the Jacket is for the most part a surprisingly good atmospheric thriller in the vein of Jacob's Ladder.  Adrien Brody stars as mentally scarred Gulf War veteran Jack Starks, who finds himself being experimented on by a mysterious doctor (Kris Kristofferson) who binds him in a strait jacket and locks him up.  During his time inside, Jack realizes he's traveling back and forth through time, and while he's doing this he has a chance encounter with a self-destructive, chain smoking waitress (Keira Knightley) and tries to figure out just how it is he will die.  The film goes along more smoothly than the summary you've just read, with Brody and Knightley in particular giving memorable turns.  The rest of the cast, including Jennifer Jason Leigh, Brad Renfro, Kelly Lynch, and new James Bond Daniel Craig, are solid as well.  All in all, the Jacket doesn't have the smarts that it aspires to be, but for the most part, you won't do much better in terms of mainstream mind bending cinema.</p></body></html>

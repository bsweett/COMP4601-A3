<meta name="summary" content="STUNNING"></head><body><p>In 1992, Zhang Yimou's HERO (Buena Vista), China's most expensive production (also it's biggest hit) won an Oscar? as Best Foreign Language Film.  It was purchased by Miramax and sat on the shelf for two years and then became a surprise hit in the U.S. when it was released theatrically.<br /><br />Jet Li is charismatic as the nameless man who confronts the emperor with three weapons from three assassins who had sworn to kill the emperor.  As he tells the story of each man, we see these episodes exquisitely filmed with dazzling action and in a dominant color.<br /><br />Words fail to convey the scope and beauty of this stunning film that, when all is said and done, is a sweeping philosophical metaphor for totalitarianism.  (Isn't there always a political agenda for such grand enterprises approved by the Chinese government.)<br /><br />Limited extras include a short, lively conversation between a distracted, plump Quentin Tarantino and a polite, almost shy Jet Li with film clips showing Li's extraordinary martial arts fighting skills from other films.  (Li was a top martial arts champion for five years starting when he was only 13!)</p></body></html>

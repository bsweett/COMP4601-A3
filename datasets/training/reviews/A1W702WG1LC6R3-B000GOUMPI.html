<meta name="summary" content=""One Of Jack's Best!""></head><body><p>Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall star in Stanley Kubrick's 1980<br />horror film based on Stephen King's novel. A man tries to kill<br />his family when he becomes caretaker of an old hotel. This is<br />one of Jack's best and I'm glad I got this special edition that<br />has nice picture and sound plus neat extras. Definitely add<br />this to your horror collection.</p></body></html>

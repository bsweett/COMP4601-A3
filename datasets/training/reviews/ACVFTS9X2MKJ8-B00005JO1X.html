<meta name="summary" content="Why is everyone in this movie so darn ugly?"></head><body><p>I guess good looking Britain's don't become actors.  This is just another movie that gets tons of "hype" put out about it and then it just becomes another kiddy fantasy with talking animals and hairy half-humans.<br /><br />Even the "white queen", the adult actor of this film is so butt ugly!  Isn't she the same ugly wench that played the angel in "Constantine?"  If they have gotten Elizabeth Hurley to play the role, that might have enhanced the appeal of this movie a tad.<br /><br />Disney seems to like to get British children for their films.  It's really beginning to get old.  Or maybe I'm just getting too old, and I'm just getting tired of the same old predictable casting happenstance.</p></body></html>

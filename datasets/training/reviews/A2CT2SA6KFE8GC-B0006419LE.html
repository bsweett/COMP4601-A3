Most become trekkies and Star Wars fanatics, and all those schmucks can have their Jean-Luc Picard cheesewheels, coz I'm a proud member of the Planet Of The Apes camp.  And I'm not monkeying around!  I absolutely love these films and have almost all my life.  Sure, as the sequels go on it tends to get a bit corny(especially when J. Lee Thompson takes over), but never becomes a joke.  The first one just can't be surpassed, but the second is a great followup and pretty damn dark.  Who as a kid wasn't creeped out by the telepathic humans even before they removed their masks?  Escape's concept seems like a bit of a stretch( like the apes could have salvaged Heston's ship from 300 feet of water and repaired it.  How the hell did they even know where it was?).  It also starts changing the rules that were established in the first film(the whole existence and downfall of intelligent man was kept a secret from the ape society, yet in this film it's common knowledge.  There's even an ape holiday like the 4th of July celebrating the apes' independence from humans.  This contradicts the first film and takes away from the corruption, paranoia and mystery of Zaius' charcater.  It's still a cool film that flipflops good guys and bad guys and has one hell of a downer ending.  By Conquest  it becomes a little easier to chuckle at the films, though it's still cool as hell.  Same goes for Battle.  The dates tend to get mixed up a bit too after the first film.  The rescue mission sent to find Heston lands about thirty years before Heston's landing in the first film!  I'm getting all nitpicky, but the fact is that these things are quite easy to overlook and are rather forgettable.  The documentary is a great two hour film that covers almost everything you wanted to know.  It's bizarre to think that up until Conquest they were trying to make "family" pictures and they all received G ratings(Conquest received a PG coz of some bloodless gun battles that were considered nonstop gore).  It's cool to think that in those days, seeing a guy killed by machine gun spray, talk of mating and castration, swear words, bare buttocks and skinless mutants were acceptable family entertainment.  This is a good set with a great treatment given to the films.  If you've got your eye on the big ape head set, let me offer some advice.  It's actually cheaper to buy all three sets individually if you find them for a decent price.  That way each disc is in it's own keepcase(which I prefer personally), and you don't have to feel like a schmuck with that rotten Tim Burton film sitting in your home.  I guess it's all a question of if you want the big head or not, which does look cool.  Go Ape!!</p></body></html>

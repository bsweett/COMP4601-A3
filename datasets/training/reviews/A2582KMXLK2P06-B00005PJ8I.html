The fact that the film starts off with so much human activity and communication which leads into Tom Hanks on an island by himself with hardly any voices being heard at all makes this a really great story.<br /><br />On an island by yourself having to do whatever it takes to survive can be a serious struggle, and that's what the film is about- trying to find ways to survive.  I love everything about this movie.  I would love to see it again.  I recommend this film to just about everyone.  Even if you're a fan of horror movies, take a break from that and watch this great movie.  It's not a horror flick obviously, but it's worth your time.</p></body></html>

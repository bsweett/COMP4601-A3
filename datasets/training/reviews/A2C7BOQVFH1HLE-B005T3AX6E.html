<meta name="summary" content="Tarantino's Best Has Just Gotten Even Better!"></head><body><p>From the very well-designed cardboard packaging to the Jack Rabbit Slim's Menu to the 16-page colour booklet to the excellent second disc filled with great extras such as documentaries and interviews to the wonderful main course coming in DTS 5.1 Surround sound options resulting in excellent sound quality as well as very good picture quality with only a couple of frames with imperfections this is truly a version of this seminal movie meant for collectors.  As far as standard version dvds go this is as good as it gets although it'll be very interesting to see how the Blu-ray version will eventually look like.<br /><br />No one tells a story as entertainingly and as uniquely in-your-face as Tarantino and this blackest of comedies is for me his very best work.  In lesser hands a tale told as disjointedly and with little care for chronology as this one does would fall flat on its face but fortunately for us the hands are Tarantino's.  There are many great performances here but surely Jackson's and Travolta's stand out.  I also thought Walken's brief contribution was extremely humorous and worthy of honourable mention as well.<br /><br />Shocking audiences upon its initial release I did find it interesting that the overall moral is still about hope for even the worst of the worst as they either find redemption after a life-changing experience e.g. Jackson or death/trauma (Travolta/Rhames)for their crimes and even the underdog has his day (Willis).  Despite the graphic violence and in-your-face vice the ending still seems to suggest good triumphs over evil in the end in true Hollywood fashion.<br /><br />Very unique, enjoyable and certainly a classic that should continue to age very well.<br /><br />Recommended!</p></body></html>

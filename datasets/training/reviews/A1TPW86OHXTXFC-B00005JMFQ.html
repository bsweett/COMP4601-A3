<meta name="summary" content="Love Naturally"></head><body><p>"Love Actually" is one of those movies that catches you with its originality.  Richard Curtis wrote and directed this movie as he did with "Four Weddings and A Funeral". He placed England's best known actors in it. This is a movie of love, actually, all kinds of love. The theme and the situations are funny, sad and illuminating.<br /><br />Hugh Grant is a newly elected prime Minister and falls in love at first sight, may I add, with his caterer. His character is quite humorous, and Hugh plays it to the max. Billy Bob Thornton plays the POTUS and is rightly put in his place, when he comes to visit the Prime Minister .Colin Firth plays a man who falls for his maid who can't speak English -and this is quite a stretch, but we believe it. Martin Freeman and Joanna Page play actors who film pornography, and while they are uuhmm filming they talk and fall in love.  Emma Thompson plays a very busy English mom who is married to Alan Rickman. They are going through the motions of a marriage until something happens that takes them up short.  Bill Nighy plays, Billy Mack, the most interesting and wonderful of all characters. He is an English musician and is going for one last effort with a pop song. He sings one of his old songs with new Christmas lyrics, and it becomes a hit. He begins to realize who he really loves. Liam Neeson is a recent widower with a very precocious son who is in love with a fellow student. Liam takes his son's infatuation seriously, and he aids his son in declaring his love. Laura Linney plays an American with unrequited love for a fellow worker, but her mentally disturbed brother takes first place.  Several very famous people dart in and out of this movie. I'll leave that as a surprise for you.<br /><br />The cinematography is glorious. The music uplifting and supreme. The characters are many, but it is not too difficult for characters to flit in and out of each story. We are able to keep up. Sometimes I wish there were more time to develop a few of the characters.<br />This is a light film to be enjoyed and relished- time to laugh and time to sigh. Highly recommended. prisrob</p></body></html>

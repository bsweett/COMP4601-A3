<meta name="summary" content="The Ultimate Revenge Pic for Fathers!"></head><body><p>If there were EVER a film for dads, this is it! Especially for dads with daughters! The action is continuous without being overbearing and it's got some great dialogue ... for an action movie.<br /><br />For those who don't know, "Taken" is about a ex-CIA agent who has retired to spend more time with his teenage daughter. When his ex-wife and daughter convince him to let her go to Paris, he's wary of it, still the usual overprotective dad, but agrees to let her go. Of course, she gets kidnapped and he has to go find her and save her. Simple plot, lots of action, lots of cool, revenge-driven dialogue, and one of my favorite actors Liam Neeson.<br /><br />THIS is the Father's Day gift that any dad (especially for ones with daughters as I can speak from experience) would appreciate. My only problem with the story is the very ending. I can't really say too much without giving it away, but all this stuff happens and then at the very end, SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT: Neeson and his daughter carry on almost as if the trauma never happened. It just seemed a little rushed and unrealistic to me, but, then again, it is a movie. And a damn good entertaining one at that!</p></body></html>

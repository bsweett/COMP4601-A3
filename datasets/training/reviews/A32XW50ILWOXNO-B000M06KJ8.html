<meta name="summary" content="History meets MTV's Laguna Beach"></head><body><p>Imagine a movie about JFK that ignores the Cuban Missile Crisis, his assassination, every important speech he ever made and every decisive action he ever took, and instead focuses on backyard football games, quickie affairs and all the pills he chewed for his ailing back.<br /><br />That's writer-director Sofia Coppola's take on the famously executed French queen  in "Marie Antoinette." Daring and defiant, it's gorgeous and entirely superficial. It'll bore and offend casual filmgoers as a monotonous, two-hour rock video void of spiritual and historical integrity.<br /><br />But it's deliberately repetitive. It's deliberately vapid. Does that make it more essential art?<br /><br />Some critics have argued just that, as Coppola's aim is to dissect the modern consumptive culture through the eyes of a queen who ruled France before she was 18, spent lavishly at her Versailles palace, and became the best-known victim of the French Revolution. She's a girl who wanted to have fun. Off with her head for it!<br /><br />This Marie, played friskily by Kirsten Dunst, is more or less a clothes and jewelry hound who knows nothing of that impending doom. She's a party kid with a teenage husband who won`t touch her in bed. She's trapped in a royal court until she breaks away and strips off the corset for a certain Swedish count at her hideaway bungalow in the country.<br /><br />Is that the real Marie? I don't think so, and neither did many of the French who lustily booed the movie at Cannes upon its premiere. Coppola is aiming for a "Portrait of a Pop Culture Artist as a Young Queen." What she produces is a lot closer to "My Super Sweet Sixteen at Versailles."<br /><br />Coppola shoots montages of shoes, and cakes and fantastic wigs to the song "I Want Candy." She crafts a purposely unsophisticated screenplay that renders Marie California articulate. Her husband, king Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) barely speaks at all. The drama is never underlined, peripheral characters emerge and disappear, and key events are MIA.<br /><br />Is it crucial to depict the fallen queen's beheading? No. But The Affair of the Necklace, as it was called, represented a crucial shift in Marie's popularity with her people. It goes unmentioned. And the tragic part of Marie's story - her imprisonment after the fall of Versailles - is entirely absent.<br /><br />In its place? Parties, drinking, sex, shopping, wide shots of the Versailles grounds, a segment in the country where Marie writhes around in the grass, more parties, drinking and gambling.<br /><br />Director of photography Lance Acord, does a terrific job creating lush, moody visuals. And Dunst does her best to act the icon her director wishes her to be.<br /><br />It's Coppola, coming off the terrific "Lost In Translation," who's not up to it. Where is her ambition? "Marie Antoinette" unfolds as if she's afraid to take the woman head on in the epic her life deserves.  Instead of grandeur and scope, Coppola bangs around the halls of Versailles, puts on a shiny dress and calls it cute.<br /><br />It smacks of fear. A modern art critic might argue "Marie Antoinette" is subverting the rules or channeling a fresh perspective. But historical rules and perspective are occasionally useful because they generally point toward the truth. This movie points to "Laguna Beach."</p></body></html>

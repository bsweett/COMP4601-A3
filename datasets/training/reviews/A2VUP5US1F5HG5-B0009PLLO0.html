<meta name="summary" content="OLIVER STONE'S ALEXANDER"></head><body><p>Don't let all the four and five-star reviews cropping up here fool you:  there's nothing great about Oliver Stone's long-winded but empty and misguided interpretation of the mighty conqueror's life.  Colin Farrell is a fine actor, but perhaps miscast as the eponymous Alexander, and for whatever reason his performance never carries conviction.  Another pair of excellent actors, Val Kilmer and Anthony Hopkins, are totally misused, leaving Angelina Jolie's perfomance as Alexander's mother Olympias the only one that really works.  Much of the most important moments from Alexander's life are quickly (and sometimes confusingly) glossed over, and the story relies far too much on talky narration to carry the plot awkwardly forward.  Even the battle scenes are handled poorly, disintegrating into indecipherable chaos.  Typically, the homoerotic subtext of Alexander's life is exaggerated, betraying a badly-conceived ideological bent that miscarries completely.  Should have been edited to a more manageable length, but even that would have only resulted in a more tolerable viewing experience, not a truly edifying one.  This is one time the box office and most national critics got it right:  ALEXANDER is a poor investment in time and money that neither entertains nor educates.  Watch the History Channel special and let this unfortunate failure fade away.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This is twice now that Sony has disappointed me like no other Japanese company in my life."></head><body><p>First of all, I will say that I gave this movie four stars for the movie.  But, this review was written on the complaint of the release of the unsuspecting un-playability of the Blu-Ray release.<br /><br />I have a Sony Blu-Ray Player, and this Blu-Ray disc of "Starship Troopers" is released by Sony.  But, guess what?  This Sony Blu-Ray player will not play this Sony Blu-ray disc.  I understand that I'm suppose to go out a buy a flash drive for my Sony Blu-Ray Player to play this movie.<br /><br />I gotta buy a flash drive just to play one movie?  How stupid is that?!  The movie doesn't even say on the box that I will be required to buy a flash drive if I want to watch this movie.  No wonder there were so many of these copies of "Starship Troopers" in the used BD bin at the used CD store.<br /><br />First Sony creates a wonderful CD burning program called ATRAC and SonicStage.  When I get nearly my whole CD library condensed to just a boxful of 33 hour CDR's, they discontinue the program so that I will not be able to burn anymore ATRAC CDR's, or buy another ATRAC CDR player in the future.<br /><br />Now, they release movies on Blu-Ray that you will not be allowed to play unless you buy a flash drive.  So, I guess this BD version of "Starship Troopers" returns to the used BD rack at the record store with the rest of them.<br /><br />Well that's it!  I will never buy another Sony product again.  They are just too inconsistent with what people will embrace with their product, and will then discontinue it without a damn that people have added their unique technology to their lifestyle, as that of their SonicStage program.  And I will not waste money on a flash drive since my DVD of "Starship Troopers" looks just fine anyway.<br /><br />Live and learn!</p></body></html>

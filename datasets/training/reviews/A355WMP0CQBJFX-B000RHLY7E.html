A BUNCH OF PSYCHOS!!"></head><body><p>this movie was a trip, a bunch of crazy, no good killers, who fortunatley get theres in the end. rob zombie, like they say practice makes perfect. better the second time around. if you don't like the sadistic crazy maniac killers who don't give a crap, well this isn't for you. cause these guys and girl are just to freakin evil, no remorse, no mercy. they make everyone pay, in the worst way possible. in general the whole storyline and craziness, i liked it and i give it a thumbs up.</p></body></html>

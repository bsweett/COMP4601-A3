Spiderman 3 is a simple movie with quite a bit of action.  Actually for anyone with a lack of attention this movie is great.  Yeah I would be included in that grouping.<br /><br />I guess what makes Spiderman so likable is that he isn't like so many other super heros.  He isn't a muscle man and his powers are pretty simple.  His enemies almost always seem stronger than him.  The enemies even seem to have a human side.<br /><br />I didn't really feel any letdowns.  The action was there from the get go and it seemed like every villain was after Spiderman.  The real villain was Spidermans alter-ego.  Coming from a black goo and transforming Spidermans suit.  This goo actually caused Spidey to be a little more evil and a lot less forgiving.  Of course there were several good battles that made everything worthwhile even when everything else was lacking.<br /><br />This movie won't have you yelling for more but it sure will give you a fun ride.  The action is intense and never seems to end.  The acting was so-so and seemed like the same story-line from other Spiderman movies.  Although with the negative this is still a good movie.  A great movie for families or anyone who has enjoyed the series.</p></body></html>

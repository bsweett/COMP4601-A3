From the story to the special effects to the actors. I really loved Liv Tyler as Betty Ross. I thought she was a major improvement over Jennifer Connelly. This actually felt like a Hulk movie. The other one was crap. And the ending to this movie is priceless. Can't wait to see what is to come.</p></body></html>

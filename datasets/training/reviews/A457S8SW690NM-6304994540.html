<meta name="summary" content="This ain't no Fargo (2 and 1/2 stars)"></head><body><p>After watching Fargo, I read about this movie and thought that I should see it because I just loved Fargo. But, this movie was very strange. Very strange and weird. The cast in this movie is simply amazing with Jeff Bridges, the brilliant John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Jullianne Moore and John Turturro. But, the movie just didn't do it for me. It certainly had some good jokes and great acting but it had WAY TOO MANY CURSE WORDS and was just so weird. I mean, it's weird when you see a topless lady on a trampoline going up and down on the screen. And that happened a couple of times. Weird. Also, if you decide to watch this, make sure that you aern't sensitive towards the F word because it's used A LOT. I mean, there rarely is a sentence that John Goodman or Jeff Bridges doesn't use it. When they didn't, I was like: "Dude! It's a miracle!"<br /><br />So be prepared to hear a lot of naughty words. I mean hundreds and hundreds of them, every 10 seconds, you'll probably hear one. So, that kind of frustrated me. Also, the weirdness was like over the top. I mean it was so weird. When Jeff Bridges would be high and have those weird visions or when the topless lady would jump up and down. I mean there was some pointless and weird stuff. I guess when the dude thinks that he's flying is pretty funny.<br /><br />Anyway, now to the plot. The plot was about a guy named Jeffrey "the dude" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) who is mistaken with another Lebowski guy who is really rich. The dude gets really peeved when some guys mistake him for the rich Lebowski and pee on his rug. So, the due is mad. The dude is into doing drugs, drinking white russians, and bowling with his pals, Donny (Steve Buscemi) and Walter (John Goddman). Donny is really funny and says really random stuff. Walter is a hot temepered Vietnam vet. When the rich Lebowski's wife is kidnapped, they ask the dude to deliver the ransom. But, Walter, Donny and the dude get into a lot of a mess with the kidnappers, the cops, a porn ring and some german wackos who threathen to remove the dude's "johnson". The plot is great and there are some good funny moments. Believe me, there are some good laughs. Walter's great as is the dude. But, Jesus (John Turturro) is really weird and pointless in the movie. John Goodman, Jeff Bridges and Steve Busemi are all excellent in the movie. As is Jullianne Moore. But a lot of F words and a lot of random weird stuff make this one dissapointing. Personally, I feel that the Coen Brothers must have been on drugs while making this because it's very weird.<br /><br />"No, I'm the dude. Or his dudness o el duderino." That was hilarious as was Walter's hot temper and Donny's stupidity.<br /><br />But, the weirdness of this movie was just too overwhelming, the conclusion was gruesome and disgusting and could have been done differently (no biting needed) and I don't know about everyone else, but I don't like hearing the F word said SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH!!!!<br /><br />As the 2nd Coen Brothers movie that I have seen, I strongly recommend the masterpiece that is Fargo, but not this one. Well, I'm still going to give Barton Fink and Raising Arizona a chance.</p></body></html>

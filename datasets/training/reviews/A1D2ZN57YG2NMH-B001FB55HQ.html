<meta name="summary" content="The Terminator? No Way. Good Flick? Totally"></head><body><p>Ok, so the "Terminator" films are legend. Arnold, Hamilton and a slew of goofy one liners, chilling murders and mind bending temporal paradox theories really defined a generation for sci-fi. With all of that in my head, I waited with baited breath to see how Christian Bale would handle the Terminator legacy... I was disappointed. I'm not saying I didn't really like the film, but there is more "Transformers" than "Terminator" about it. So, my bottom line: If you like Christian Bale, great action, amazing acting and heart pounding music... you're going to love this movie. I really did like it, but it was definitely NOT "The Terminator."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Alot is Left Out, But the Essentials Are Handled Beautifully"></head><body><p>As other reviewers have noted, by necessity a lot of book 5 is left out of this movie, in order to keep the length manageable, but I think that is OK. Just watch it as a movie in a movie series, not as a play-by-play of the book, and you will be able to appreciate it. The focus is on the most essential aspects of the story - the growing threat of Voldemort, the denial of the ministry and media to accept this, including their smearing of Potter and Dumbledore, the evolution of the Order of the Phoenix, the growing authoritarian repression at Hogwarts under Professor Umbridge, and Harry's struggles with Voldemort's increasing presence in his mind. That's  A LOT to cover, and the movie does it well.<br /><br />This is a dark movie - the death of Cedric at the end of book and movie 4 marks the turning point in this series. From this point forward it is an out-and-out battle between good and evil, and the darker mood - and look - of this film reflects that. There is a lot of tension, and a lot of repressed (and expressed) anger, in the form of Umbridge, and, of course, Harry. Everyone is struggling to come to terms with what is happening, and many are denying it. Harry's status as an outsider is cemented, and yet, he rediscovers the importance of love and friendship in the form of Dumbledore's Army. This is a lot of psychoological complexity, coupled with adolescent angst, and everyone manages to pull it off.<br /><br />The final climactic scene, in which Dumbledore helps Harry 'expel' Voldemort from his mind, is critical to understanding the themes of this entire series, and I think it is done justice here. That in and of itself is enough to make me love this movie. So my advice is to forgive what is not covered, and assess it according to what is really most important to the series - if everything had been put in, some of the subtler scenes that drive the psychological drama would have been more rushed. Choices were made, and it's all to the good in my view.</p></body></html>

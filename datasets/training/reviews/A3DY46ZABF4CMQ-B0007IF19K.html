<meta name="summary" content="Hit the road, Foxx, and don't you come back no more"></head><body><p>I saw this movie when it was first released back in September, and something gave me the feeling that this was the year that the critics and hollywood were going to blow up Jamie Foxx out of proportion. Well, they did and now Foxx has won the Golden Globe award for best actor in a musical/comedy for his performance as the late musician Ray Charles.<br /><br />First of all, if you are not a fan of Charles or simply do not know who he is or was, then I presume that this film is not for you. The movie was made for Ray's fans in particular and those who appreciated his music. In modern terms for the younger generation, Ray is a long version of a Behind The Music episode on VH1, but instead of interviews, we get dramatic re-enactments of the events surrounding Charles' life from his younger years, how he became blind, rose to fame, and destroyed himself with a heroin addiction. The film successfully details these events, and does it with an eager enthusiasm. The major drive behind of the movie, however, and the true highlight of the entire story is the music. Remember, this is a movie about Ray Charles, the man who sang such classics as You Don't Know Me, Hit The Road Jack, Georgia On My Mind, and Unchain My Heart; all these songs appear in the movie.<br /><br />Finally, there's the acting. To be honest, I didn't get the whole Jamie Foxx buzz (he was in Held Up for crying out loud, one of the worst films ever made). It will take Foxx the next couple of films to really prove himself, which in my opinion he won't be able to due to the fact that he really isn't the best thing I have seen on the big screen in a long time. I mean he doesn't come close to Denzel Wasington or Will Smith (who's been making some really dumb movies recently) I can't deny, however, that Foxx does an excellent impression of Ray Charles, but I don't think impressions are worthy of any best acting awards, unless of course if the actor added his own into it. If Foxx is getting all this praise, then I guess Jim Carrey should have won about 3 Oscars already, and Dave Coulier should make a comeback very soon!<br /><br />Average<br /><br />***1/2 out of *****<br /><br />C+</p></body></html>

This time, Arnold Schwarzenegger is not a good guy, but the movie is still pretty awesome. I think this probably had to do in part with John Connor not being in this film, and instead focused on Sarah Connor and John's father as they try to escape Sarah's would-be assassin.<br /><br />Overall this is a pretty good movie which helps to kick off the Terminator saga, and in my personal opinion, the best installment in the series.</p></body></html>

It was just about one place in the US which was New York. Ironically, the statue of Liberty is there which reads:<br /><br />"Give me your tired, your poor,<br />Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,<br />The wretched refuse of your teeming shore,<br />Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,<br />I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"<br /><br />What the movie was trying to say is that if the immigrants didn't benefit or agree with the "political party in power" they were not really welcome. With this distrust of others and the greed of money, gangs were formed within each group. The plot then thickened because of one leader was killed by another with the survivor being the dead leader's son seeking revenge against his killers. The plot was excellent with excellent cast roles in the story. I highly recommend this movie that wants to see what it was/is really like for "immigrants" coming to the US.</p></body></html>

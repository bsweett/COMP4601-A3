For audience, we were compelled to think of the "what" and "why" that motivated them to do so and so.  Suffice to say that this movie touched upon the issues of life, death, guilt, redemption and guilt.  What made this movie so intriguing was three people from three very different backgrounds, due to some inexplicable circumstances put them together.  Their universe basically collided and with that came fireworks of unimaginable kind.  The "behind the scene" was useful to allow us to understand in-depth of the Director's various decisions.  All actors interviewed talked about the movie and the roles that they played candidly.  On the screen, those magnificent actors and actress in the form of Benicio, Sean and Naomi were superb.  We really couldn't take our eyes off them.  Their performances were compelling and that's probably what made 21 Gram so watchable.  A slow movie that best suited art movie lover or even audience that sought intelligent story-line.  Definitely not for the faint-hearted and the cover DVD said it well that this movie does stay with you after watching it.  Highly recommended</p></body></html>

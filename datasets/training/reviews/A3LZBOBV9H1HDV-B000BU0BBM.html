<meta name="summary" content=""The Brothers Grimm" is great!"></head><body><p>"The Brothers Grimm" is great! Matt Damon (Wilhelm Grimm) and Heath Ledger (Jacob Grimm) are great. Peter Stormare adds some comic relief as Cavaldi. Terry Gilliam's directing is excellent. The story & screenplay by Ehren Kruger (who recently wrote the screenplays for "The Ring Two" (2005) & "The Skeleton Key" (2005) is great. The music by Dario Marianelli is great. The cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel (who also did the cinematography to "X2" (2003) is excellent. The film editing by Lesley Walker (who also film edited some of Gilliam's films, like "The Fisher King" (1991) & "Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas" (1998) is great. The production design by Guy Dyas (who also did the production design to "X2" (2003) and the upcoming "Superman Returns" (2006) is excellent. The art direction by Andy Thomson & Frank Walsh (who both also did the art direction, recently, to "The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy" (2005) is excellent. The set decoration by Guy Dyas & Judy Farr is excellent. The costume design by Gabriella Pescucci (who most recently did the costume design to "Charlie And The Chocolate Factory" (2005) & "Van Helsing" (2004) & Carlo Poggioli (who also did the costume design with Pescucci to "Van Helsing" (2004) and also "Cold Mountain" (2003) is excellent. This is a dark, funny, and twisted satire on the fairy tales that inspired the Grimm brothers.</p></body></html>

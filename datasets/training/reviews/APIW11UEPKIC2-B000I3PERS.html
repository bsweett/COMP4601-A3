<meta name="summary" content="I didn't notice the bad picture quality like a last reviewer did"></head><body><p>I thought the picture was fine.  Sound quality is very good and I was able to see all of the fights with blood and guts flying everywhere just fine.  I would like see a special edition though but making of's and a documentary on how a film was made, those types of special features are just getting boring.  Maybe you are looking for a blu-ray version of it but I have seen too many problems with these hi-def dvd's.  This DVD is cheap and is more than worth it.  I also found the behind the scene's and commentary from Mel Gibson very enjoyable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Vastly overrated; undeserved Oscars."></head><body><p>This is nothing but another Western. Anyone expecting some brilliance or originality to be in sync with its Oscar win as Best Pic of 1992 will be sorely disappointed. Starts out with a gratuitously violent slashing of a prostitute and goes downhill in unpleasantness from there. I think I can guess why the Hollywood left-libs loved this enough to make it best pic: it portrays the West (read "America") as unheroic and simply violent and evil. That's the sort of garbage that the creeps in Hollywood lap up like cats to a saucer of milk. Hey, celebrities!! If America sucks, kindly return all of that money you get from us for working a few weeks a year, will ya? My feelings won't be hurt.</p></body></html>

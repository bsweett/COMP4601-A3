<meta name="summary" content="Comedy fun for the family"></head><body><p>It's not typical nowadays to see a movie that can remain somewhat appropriate and be a good comedy.  This movie may be blasphomous to diehard Nascar fans but was a non stop joyride for me.  The fun is all in watching these chracters play into the roles of redneck racers.  Although the movie pressed a slight message of teamwork the true fun came from watching Will Ferrell interact with Sacha Baron Cohen.  I can see these actors coming together on many comedies in the near future.  With all the sex driven and action packed lackluster movies out now it's good to have a few good comedies to stir the pot.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Still one of the Best Movies Ever Made"></head><body><p>For all the baggage that Citizen Kane is bagged with, it's pretty remarkable that underneath, the hype (Citizen Kane tops the list of AFI's greatest films of all time, on both editions), the hate, and opposing view points about it, Citizen Kane is really a good movie.  Make no mistake, in my opinion, Citizen Kane is not the best movie of all time, but that's not it's fault some people scrutnize it because of those biased film geeks at the American Film Institure (though it certainly has more of it's virtues than a magazine like Rolling Stone does) It is one of the most innovative films, however, and I won't deny the importance of the movie.  The good thing about all this is that the movie is still a great movie, and has a good story, and the filmmaking and artistic quality is still very good.  Here's why I think so.<br /><br />Personally, I don't think the film making in this movie is a product of it's time. While it's not as fresh as it must have been when it was first released, it's still has artistic quality and has some of the coolest shots still worth looking at years later.  The Rosebud shot, the opener, the noirish look, the scene with the mirrors, even the art direction in this movie is great.  Cinematographer Gregg Toland deserved an Oscar for his work (of course he didn't), as it's as incredible to hear about the details from the commentary from Roger Ebert (this man is a film critic, he knows a ton about film that idiots like Ben Lyons and Gene Shalit only wish they did).  The acting is great, and it's hard to believe that Welles was able to pull off both young and old Kane (the make up was responsible for the old, and that was even influential), convincing no less.  It always feels like a meticolously crafted film, and it pretty much is.  The only potential thing that could be considered dated in some eyes is the black and white and 1941 production standards, which to me don't even matter much.  Everything else looks as fresh as it did in 1941.<br /><br />Citizen Kane is basically a pastiche of William Randolph Hearst, a newspaper king who apparently did not like this movie because it portrayed him in a negative light.  Regarding it's meaning, the message may be obvious for a lot of people.  And no, it doesn't rely on the symbolism.  I sort of agree with Ray Carney on the symbolism part, which is nice, but not really a profound statement.  Symbolism to me is more like a cool footnote, and if it's done tastefully, it works merely well. (that can't be said for the millions of mediocre student films that say nothing, except they are slathered with pretentious symbolism).  Citizen Kane is both of the previously mentioned.  However, I do not find the scene where he finds the globe to be symbolism.  I've seen objects before that totally transfix me and take me back to my younger days, I don't know, but it does.  The object isn't the focus, the way he reacts to the object is the focus.<br /><br />Rather, I think Citizen Kane is loss of pureness, or idealism.  Kane wanted to help other people because he's truly believed it in the beginning, but gradually became selfish, empty.  Kane is just a representation of just how many things can be reduced from their good intentions to emptiness.  Look at the concepts of free will, individualism, love, and personal fullfillment.  All of these things are pure when taken in the right mind, but all of these have been robbed and dumbed down into general fakeness (the government, marketing, music, movies, even people themselves) and used to push buttons, sell products, and trick people into believing the fakeness is actually genuine.  At a most basic level though, it shows that money indeed doesn't buy happiness, and you have to be internally motivated, and for good reasons.  There's nothing more enriching than good relationships (with the right people) and genuine care,  and if we give in to greed and fakeness, we could end up just like Kane.  That's my take on the meaning of Citizen Kane.<br /><br />Is Citizen Kane, in my opinion, the best film of all time?  It's definitely the most influential, and maybe it deserves the greatest title as a monument kind of stature, but it will never be among my favorite films of all time.  And that' mostly the difference here. It will never be a personal favorite to me, but Citizen Kane, for the right camp (I am in that camp), will satisfy mightily.  Please ignore everyone else and whatever anybody tells you and like it for how you like it.  There is no other way in life in figuring out what you like.</p></body></html>

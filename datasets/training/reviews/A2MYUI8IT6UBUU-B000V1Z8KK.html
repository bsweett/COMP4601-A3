<meta name="summary" content="Shooter Movie Review from MoviePulse.net"></head><body><p>There is tremendous pressure placed on a filmmaker after he delivers an Oscar winning picture early in his career, and ever since Training Day received its award for best acting all eyes have been on Antoine Fuqua to do it again. Trying to rekindle the "Academy" caliber magic, the filmmaker has attempted two epically scaled war films to little success. Even with an Oscar to your picture's credit, in Hollywood, three strikes can usually mean you're out. Luckily for Fuqua, the director had one last trick up his sleeve that will hit audiences from a mile away.<br /><br />While the trailer made the film appear as if it was a less entertaining version of In the Line of Fire, Fuqua's new film, Shooter, is a surprisingly fresh take on a hard-R action film. Starring Mark Whalberg, Shooter boldly exhibits a true anti-hero vigilante that is not afraid to dole out justice even if it means sacrificing customary role-model morals.<br /><br />Framed by a powerful, unnamed rogue corporation for an assassination attempt on the President of the United States, ex-marine and expert sniper Bob Lee Swagger not only has to outrun federal agents in order to prove his innocence, but the world's best "shooter" must extract revenge in places where the law is incapable of going.<br /><br />Fuqua, a director who has a history of working with strong male leads, certainly picked perhaps the hottest up and coming male property Hollywood has to offer these days to fill in this role of a modern day Rambo. Coming off his Academy Award nominated performance in The Departed, Mark Whalberg certainly carries the mantle of a John Wayne-like cowboy, dealing justice from the end of a smoking barrel, quite well.<br /><br />Though the marketing campaign makes the picture appear to be a political thriller, at its heart Shooter is a revenge film that works on a simple premise: for every injustice vengeance must be taken. Granted there are some points where the film gets bogged down with over-the-top government conspiracy mumbo jumbo, these holdovers from the novel upon which Shooter was based can easily be forgiven thanks to a simple remedy provided by Fuqua: he knows how to blow stuff up.<br /><br />Offering refreshing action based on exhilarating practical effects, Shooter fires up impressive blood sprays, napalm explosions, crashing helicopters and great hand to hand combat sure to satiate the appetite of action lovers. At some point during the narrative the film tries to justify Whalberg's raw justice by insinuating that the film's villains, headed by Warren Beatty and Danny Glover, were involved in the destruction and killing of an entire African village for monetary gain. However, Shooter so clearly draws a line between the good and the bad that this subplot is moot; we already want to see Bob Lee Swagger exact his revenge, and each kill along his quest is even more satisfying than the last.<br /><br />Predictably audiences will know where Shooter will ultimately go, but that is the nature of the genre. The simple storytelling and intensity of the picture's action should be enough for this substantially memorable spring blockbuster to captivate audiences. Though it may not be Oscar material, Fuqua has proved that not only does he have big budget hits left in him, but that Shooter is an unadulterated shot to the head.<br /><br />-Joe Russo, MoviePulse.net</p></body></html>

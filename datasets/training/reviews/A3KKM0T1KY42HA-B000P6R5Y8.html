<meta name="summary" content="My Girl Crosses the Bridge to Terabithia to Meet Old Yeller in Oz"></head><body><p>I'm surprised that the MPAA gave Bridge to Terabithia a PG rating....Not because I think that it should have been given a more restrictive rating, but because the MPAA is so conservative these days with movies for kids that might be "too deep" or might "make a child sad".<br /><br />Bridge to Terabithia is indeed a kid's movie, with a couple of kids (Josh Hutcherson & AnnaSophia Robb) turning in a couple of moving performances. My oldest was captivated. My middle-guy thought that it as "awesome". When I asked my youngest if it was a good movie...well...I got a "no". But my youngest was definitely as captivated as my oldest. In fact, this was originally a rental for us, but we picked up the Blu-ray edition after my youngest was so upset when I returned the rental.<br /><br />Here's the thing: They just don't make movies like Bridge to Terabithia for kids anymore; or, if they do, it usually gets smacked with a PG-13. But Bridge to Terabithia is no more frightening or deep than The Wizard of Oz <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ADS63K">The Wizard of Oz (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> , My Girl <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800177991">My Girl</a> or Old Yeller <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005RRG4">Old Yeller (Vault Disney Collection)</a> .<br /><br />Bridge to Terabithia is much more about childhood issues and dealing with them than fantasy and folklore. It's also a tale of what tweens might do to have fun--use their imagination--in their spare time....They dream of a magic place where they are The King and Queen of Terabithia. (The movie is based on the 1977 children's novel of the same name by Katherine Paterson, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0064401847">Bridge to Terabithia</a> .) This movie will also present that life is not always so rosy at times, so if you're the type that wants to hide that fact from your kids then you might be disappointed with Bridge to Terabithia.<br /><br />In the film, one of the kids is even invited by his teacher (Zooey Deschanel) on what ultimately ends up being a private excursion to a museum; and I must say that during the scene my wife and I looked at each other and we were like, "Oh no, what's going on here?" Well...nothing....The female teacher took the young male student (who indeed clearly had a crush on the teacher) to a museum. Nothing else. It just goes to show what a different world we live in today where you (sadly) can't trust a situation like that from the days of Old Yeller where Barney Fife might show up and not arrest the teacher, but instead suggest that they all stop by the local ice cream parlor on the way home.<br /><br />Bridge to Terabithia is a very good movie...a family movie...that might frighten at times; it might make a kid think at times; and it might make a kid cry here and there.</p></body></html>

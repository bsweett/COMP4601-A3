<meta name="summary" content="A Serious, Suspenseful Thriller. The Special FX still Dazzle"></head><body><p>Being a Huge John Carpenter fan and an Even Bigger Kurt Russel fan, I didn't need much prodding to purchase "The Thing - Collectors Edition" on DVD, (even though I had Never seen it) and even though it was a Gamble, it was a Gamble that paid off.<p>Kurt Russel plays part of an American Research team in Antarctica, who seem to be Infested with some kind of Alien Species, as The Thing infiltrates members of the group, (using their bodies like pods) the members left alive begin to fight amongst themselves. It's becomes a "Nobody trust Nobody" scenario that Descends into an Orgy of Violence and Carnage. (if that doesn't excite you, nothing will) <p>Kurt's makes his Character the Strong Silent type, like "Snake Plissken", his character in John Carpenters "Escape from New York". The Entire Cast takes it all Very, Very Seriously, which helps make the film Genuinely Scary. John Carpenter help by getting Maximum Thrills out of the Scenario, the Sets and the Special Effects. Rob Bottin's Alien Effects are some of the most Ingenious Creations in Cinema History.  <p>These days, Scary, Serious Monster movies are quite rare. Films like "Deep Rising" and "The Mummy" are played more for laughs, "Anaconda" and "Lake Placid" are about as Scary as "Attack of the Teletubies", "The Thing" is Different. It is a Deadly Serious, Genuinely Scary Thriller that works Just as well Today as it did in the 80's.</p></body></html>

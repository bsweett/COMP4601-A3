The most recent comparison would of course have to be Michelle Pfeiffer as the leather clad feline fighter in Tim Burtons Batman Returns, and whereas I understand characters must evolve with the times, they should not be changed altogether. Pfeiffer and Burton came close to encapsulating the multi faceted role, whereas this time around the production team and director seem to have missed by a mile. Ms Berry plays Patience Phillips, a Plain Jane artist, seeking her inner self, and trapped working for a large cosmetic conglomerate as a designer. She overhears something bad about the companies latest product and is dispatched forthwith, by the villainous Sharon Stone, as wife to the head of the company. Reborn with the aid of a mystical Egyptian Mau cat, and a seemingly all wise "little old lady" she emerges as Catwoman, and sets about bringing her erstwhile foes to justice, and in so doing discover her true self. The visual distraction of her in a costume that would have fried the censors back in the 60's may be enough for adolescents, or the less demanding viewer, but this is a pretty poor attempt really. The darkness and depth of the Marvel creation is never seen, as Ms Berry plays out a little girl lost turned Vigilante with a muddled ambivalence. Staying well inside the Politically Correct (PC) line, she is almost shown as a goody two shoes, reluctantly playing a part and keeping everyone happy, rather than getting inside the storybook character. Another BIG complaint for me is the CGI fusion with live action. Much like the "Blade" movies, seeing a cartoon computer overlay scramble up walls, flip, turn, jump and perform inhuman stunts doesn't work I'm afraid, even if you do seemlessly match it with the actor in places. Even impressive SfX should compliment a films story,  NOT try and carry it altogether. There are some nice extra's on the DVD however, and the story is not too ridiculous. The supporting cast are sound, and the visuals OK, but you keep feeling that the script writer and director should have taken the plunge a little more, rather than just dipping their toes into an Iconic character such as they have here. OK for a wet afternoon, and a PG audience, but that's about it. Disappointing.</p></body></html>

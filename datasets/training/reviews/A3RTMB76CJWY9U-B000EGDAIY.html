It stars Sarah Michelle Gellar (of BtVS fame) as an American nurse who is charged to watch over a woman in Tokyo. Hijinks ensue, as the house of that woman is home to angry spirits, who track down and kill all those who enter the house. The acting's fine, the direction's fine, etc. Really, the big question that must be asked of a horror film is:<br /><br />Is it scary?<br /><br />Maybe yes and maybe no, depending on what you think of when you think of the word "scary."<br /><br />The Grudge is not scary in the sense that Rosemary's Baby or Whatever Happened to Baby Jane were scary. It's not scary in the same way that Psycho, Alien, Halloween or Scream were scary. It's not even scary the same way the Final Destination movies were scary. It's nothing psychological. It's not the ambience. You won't walk away from the movie looking around corners or afraid to turn out the lights. Instead, the movie is scary because the visuals are disturbing and they jump out at you from out of nowhere, with a crash of music.<br /><br />You see, the special effects/make-up team do a great job at creating scary-looking ghosts to terrify Sarah Michelle Gellar, and when they leap out at you with little warning, you'll get a jolt. It's reflexive, kind of like how you'll flinch if something's thrown at your face. But it's hardly the same kind of terror as the true classics of the genre.<br /><br />Real horror isn't *just* things jumping at you, but it's a sense of how and why they're jumping out; the context. In The Grudge, apparently you're a target because you step foot in the wrong home (where bad things, of course, have happened). After that, you're hunted down by the spirits until they... well... we don't actually know *what* they do. We only know that they look scary, and their victims die in some unspecified way. Why are the spirits able to dispatch some victims quite easily while others resist for some period of time? Don't know. Is there any way of fighting back against the spirits? Don't know. Why did the spirits materialize here, specifically, as opposed to all of the other scenes of violent crimes that pepper our lands? Don't know.<br /><br />Basically, the plot has so many holes, because the plot is unimportant to the film, which holds itself as nothing more than a delivery system for those "jump out at you" moments. Without a real context, you're only scared when the freaky-looking ghosts are on screen; the terror fades as soon as they're gone. While it's scary in a dark theater, it doesn't hold up once you're back out in the sunshine. A fun flick to see once, perhaps, but not something you'll be discussing in 5 years, or really even 5 weeks.<br /><br />Three stars, because it does what it wants to do and is executed well in terms of production values, acting, etc. It wants the last two stars, however, because it's lightweight and horror of the most fleeting kind.</p></body></html>

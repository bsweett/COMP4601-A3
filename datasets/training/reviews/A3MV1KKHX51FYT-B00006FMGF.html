Harry wants to run around with his friends (who are driving without a license). This film panders to teenagers by portraying parents as stupid, when in fact it is teenagers who are ignorant of the dangers that can occur in the real world. The computer generated images are better than in the previous film; full of sound and fury to accompany meaningless action. Special effects are not a substitute for a good story. The British class system is alive and well in Warthogs; the "mudbloods" are kept in their place. (Or is the gender discrimination experienced by the author?)<br /><br />The interpersonal conflicts between Harry and Malfoy lead to a duel before the school. Then Harry finds a petrified student ("stone drunk"?) There is a trick where they change shapes and acquire information not meant for them. Someone vandalizes Harry's room and steals a diary. Then Hermione becomes another petrified student (from boredom?). Haggrid becomes a suspect, Harry visits the monster spider deep in the woods. The magic car allows them to escape. The teacher expected to act against the danger tries to run away. [This teaches children to not believe the stories they are told.]<br /><br />The Secret Chamber is found by magic, and boys leap to discover the secrets. The secret of the villain is revealed. Harry fights and kills a giant snake! There is a final confrontation with Lord Voldemort, who dies by magic. This story seems weak and confuse. Those who enjoyed it can have their viewpoint. [This film seems to have more British expressions than in the earlier film.]</p></body></html>

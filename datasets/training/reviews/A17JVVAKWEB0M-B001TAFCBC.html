The brain is the equivalent of a large filing cabinet, and the removal of painful memories is as simple as isolating the files associated with the person or event and taking them out. Described as a form of brain damage, the procedure is quick and efficient, as troubled patients are promised a future free of those troubling episodes that haunt us all.<br /><br />But that only establishes the world of the film. The plot involves the question of what happens when two former lovers both choose to erase each other from their memories and then meet again without any knowledge of their previous relationship. The film goes on to explore questions about true love and how much a person's identity depends on his/her memory.<br /><br />The two lovers in the film as played by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, and neither have been better. Carrey is reserved and introverted, a reminder of other Charlie Kaufman-created leads in Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. He is witty, educated, but painfully inept in social settings. As opposites attract, his love interest is all the things he is not. She is spontaneous and lively, but lacks much mystery and depth.<br /><br />The film begins in the middle, before they meet again "for the first time". We see their previous relationship in flashbacks, most of the film taking place in Carrey's mind as he goes through his memory erasing procedure. While in the middle of the process, conflict arises in his mind. A heartbreaking realization ensues, as he must give up the tender moments of their affair (along with the painful ones). The horror of the procedure is exposed; it is the equivalent of the death of a loved one.<br /><br />While watching them build their relationship a second time, many viewers will be torn. Some will say it is the power of true love, thrusting them back together as if they are destined for each other. Others will believe they are making the same mistake again and will not want them to suffer through another courtship that ended as badly as the first.<br /><br />At the heart of the film is a relationship between two people presented with all the cruel truths of reality. While we do see the wonderful moments shared by two people in love, we also see how painful love can be when those involve really know what how to hurt their partner. The film offers ambiguous answers to the matters of the heart, but succeeds in presenting a story and world that should stimulate imaginations and spark debate.</p></body></html>

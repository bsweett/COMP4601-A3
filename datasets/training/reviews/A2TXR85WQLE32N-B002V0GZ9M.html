<meta name="summary" content="Romance is Timeless..."></head><body><p>"The Lake House" pairs up Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves for the first time since "Speed" in what turns out to be a very watchable but unconventional romance.<br /><br />Bullock plays Doctor Kay Forster, who is departing a unique glass cottage on a lake to return to Chicago.  She leaves a note for the next tenant, architect and builder Alex Wyler, played by Reeves.  The two fall into an exchange of letters and it soon becomes apparent, with several humorous touches, that Alex is in the cottage in 2004, while somehow Kay is living in 2006.  The singularity of a time-traveling mailbox outside the cottage is never explained; viewers are advised to accept it as a necessary plot contrivance.  Alex and Kay discover the time difference in an hilarious scene in which the two stand in the same place two years apart, reading and writing a series of notes that are essentially being passed back and forth through the mailbox.<br /><br />The correspondence across time brings two lonely but compatible people together.  Their slowly blossoming romance is complicated in a interesting way by the time difference.  Alex actually has a couple of contacts with the 2004 Kay, who knows nothing yet of Alex or the Lake House and is involved with an obnoxious and disposable boyfriend.  A scene in which the 2006 Kay asks Alex to retrieve a book she lost in 2004 is nicely done; Alex's ultimately successful effort to return the book helps cement their relationship.<br /><br />The desire of the 2004 Alex and the 2006 Kay to meet face to face begins to drive the story.  A date with Kay arranged two years in advance by Alex fails, heartbreakingly, when Alex fails to appear.  At this point, a fatal accident that Kay witnessed at the start of her medical residency in 2004 begins to overshadow the story.  Kay must use her knowledge of the future to somehow change the past.  The dramatic ending of the movie makes it all worthwhile.<br /><br />The Glass House on the lake is a fascinating structure in and of itself; unfortunately, we never get a really good look at it.  Christopher Plummer has an outstanding cameo as Alex's father, a famous architect who built the Glass House before essentially abandoning his family.  Shohreh Aghdashloo is outstanding as Kay's medical mentor, who in one of several loop-backs in the movie also treats Alex's dying father.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended to viewers looking for a romantic movie featuring two leads with real onscreen chemistry; those who obsess over the time-traveling wrinkles of the plot are likely to miss the best of the story.</p></body></html>

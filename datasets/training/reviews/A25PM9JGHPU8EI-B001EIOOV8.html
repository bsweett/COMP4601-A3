<meta name="summary" content="Finally gets the deluxe edition it richly deserves"></head><body><p>Definitely one of my favorite Scorsese films, Casino FINALLY gets it's due. Filmed in Super 35, it's never looked better than here. It's been a long wait from the days of laserdisc and even the original dvd release, but it's been worth it. A film like this has dialogue so crisp you want to read along, but unfortunately it is NOT closed-captioned, only subtitled and SPARSELY at that, not detailed; a minor complaint, but if you want to savor every word spoken, it's a little disappointing. Would love to have had a full-length commentary featuring De Niro, Pesci, and Scorsese sitting down to talk through this but the track that is included is still very good. Excellent disc; would have been worth picking up again for the improved film transfer.</p></body></html>

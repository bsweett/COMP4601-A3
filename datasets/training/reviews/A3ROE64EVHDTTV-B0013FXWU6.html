Stylistically similar to a Sergio Leone film.<br />*Some fascinating ideas; in particular, a lot of paralell cases where people are using or abusing each other for gain.  Makes for subtle but complex story.<br />*Also provides some fascinating insight on the oil drilling business.<br />*Excellent acting; interesting group of characters.<br />*Good writing.<br />*Excellent music; John Williams can eat his heart out.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Very very long.<br /><br />The Ugly (or Questionable) Things<br />*Pretty weak story; focus is more on internal conflicts and rivalries than on any physical conflict.<br />*Despite the movie's title, there are only a few violent scenes, and they are not too graphic.  If you're looking for a bloody action film, this would not be it.<br />*Abrupt, crazy ending.<br /><br />This is basically like "Citizen Kane" in the west; a broad story about relentless ambition and corruption.  It's a very long, slow-moving film, with an epic scope and scale.  The story can be seen as tedious or boring, and perhaps even pointless, but the main attraction are the characters, all of whom are well-developed and well-acted.  With patience, it is worthwhile watching at least once.<br /><br />Image and sound quality is excellent (especailly in blu-ray).  The single-disc DVD has no special features.  The two-disc and blu-ray versions have a 1923 silent film depicting the oil business, a fifteen-minute montage of behind-the-scenes stuff, a few deleted scenes, and a couple of the trailers.</p></body></html>

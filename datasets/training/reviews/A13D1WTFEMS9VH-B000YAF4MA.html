However, this is not a comedy -- unless you find terminal cancer a knee-slapper. I don't want to pay money to see someone who is undergoing chemotherapy racing to the toilet to vomit. But I dunno, maybe it's just me. I had to watch a few 'Three Stooges' episodes to get undepressed. For funny, I'll take a good poke in the eyes any ol' day.</p></body></html>

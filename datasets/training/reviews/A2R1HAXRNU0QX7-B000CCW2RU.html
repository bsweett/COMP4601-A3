<meta name="summary" content="As escapist fare, it does better than most.  3 1/2 stars."></head><body><p>While this is certainly no masterpiece, THE ISLAND did provide two hours of entertaining, preposterous noise...it was fun.  If someone was hoping for or expecting more from it, I guess you've never seen the previews or any other movies by Michael Bay...cuz his movies are either fast moving, overblown, ridiculous and boring (PEARL HARBOR) or fast moving, overblown, ridiculous and kinda amusing (BAD BOYS).  None are art...none will be remembered for long.<br /><br />But on its own terms, there are many things to recommend this film.  The premise is the best part:  clones are raised as replacement parts for the rich people who can afford to have them manufactured.  For reasons the movie only barely explains, the clones have to live full, sentient lives or they are no good as doners...so the fabulously wealthy and very villainous company that owns the clones invents a complex "futuristic" society where everyone dresses the same, does mundane work and is pretty much forbidden to ask questions.  Their only reason for living is to win the lottery and a free trip to live on "The Island," the only uncontaminated outside environment left in the world.  Naturally, the winner of a trip to the island is actually winning a one way ticket to euthanasia, so their organs can be harvested.  This is not a new idea, exactly, but the life in this society is actually portrayed in a fun, original and enjoyable manner.  We know...because we've seen similar stories before...that there is no Island.  But we enjoy seeing these na?ve humans running around with no real purpose.  It's a "Brave New World" kinda place.<br /><br />The movie also has an appealing cast going for it.  Ewan MacGregor plays Lincoln, the clone who discovers the secret.  He's just really a likeable, personable actor and he's good a being squeaky-clean and na?ve.  He's good at playing an "innocent" and his outrage when the innocence is lost is fun too.  If a more "hard-boiled" performer had been cast...more of a typical action star...we would not have enjoyed his discoveries nearly as much.<br /><br />I admit I was worried about the idea of Scarlett Johanssen in this film.  Sometimes she is just SO still and quiet and introverted that she can be a bit dull.  But she puts on a little bit of "perky" personality, and her placid face works well for the type of character she's supposed to be...something of a blank.  When she gets to "escape" and toughen up a bit, she makes it credible enough that I never thought "she was the wrong choice."<br /><br />Sean Bean is the main villain, and he could do this character in his sleep...but that doesn't mean he isn't good at it.  Djomon Honsou (from AMISTAD and IN AMERICA) plays a bounty-hunter type character.  It's a nothing role...I mean really nothing...but he has a great screen presence.  Michael Clark Duncan (THE GREEN MILE) has a small but very effective part.<br /><br />There are bad things too.  There is one spectacular highway car chase where Lincoln starts throwing heavy old train tires off a truck onto the highway, where they bounce and spin and crash spectacularly into the chasing cars.  But the scene is VERY much like Bay's scene in BAD BOYS II when boats are thrown off the back of a truck into the chasing cars behind.  For so much time and expense, you'd think he could have done something more original.<br /><br />The movie has no real surprises either.  It's fun for awhile to know more than the clones do...but towards the end we realize that we have no surprises in store...it's just a lot of noise and explosions.  There is no real emotional payoff in the movie...and no Michael Bay film ever has any.  They are so fraught with explosions, over-edited and so poorly written that we never CARE about anyone.  Thank goodness MacGregor is likeable enough on his own to carry his part without the help of a good script.<br /><br />But overall, I still recommend the movie if you go into it with appropriate expectations.  It is escapist fun.  Nothing else.  As such, you should enjoy it.</p></body></html>

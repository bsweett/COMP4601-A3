<meta name="summary" content="Alien: The Best of the Bunch"></head><body><p>The thing that amazes me  most about &quot;Alien&quot; is there are no signs of it being made in 1978!  I first saw this when I was 8 years old, and to this day, it remains one of my all time favourite movies.  The sets  are outrageous and literally out of this world.  True art!  Dark and  dreary, spooky and altogher ookey, The Alien Family! (couldn't  resist!).<p>And am i the only one who thinks this is really, the only  &quot;good&quot; Alien movie?  What is the deal with &quot;Aliens&quot;?  I  thought the sequel was totally lame.  &quot;Alien&quot; was more thought  provocking and deep.  It was also more artistic and meaningful, on an  intellectual standpoint.  It drew you more inward. It raised questions  about space and beyond, the uncertainity of darkness, our future.  The  acting was also top notch, totally believable.  The fear was so real, you  felt it, you saw it.  Perspiration drenched fear.  The psychology of  &quot;Alien&quot; and the mystery of outer space give this film a haunting  edge over the other sequels. The mystery and intruigue, the quietness,  except for the humming of the spacecraft cast an eerie gloom, delving you  further into the realm of space, drawing you nearer to the Alien!  Suspenseful and glorious.</p></body></html>

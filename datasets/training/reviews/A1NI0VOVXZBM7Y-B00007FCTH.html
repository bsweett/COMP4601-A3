<meta name="summary" content="Citizen Kane"></head><body><p>I watched this film with someone who had to do this for a film class and it is a acquired taste like licorice,It is boring,Predictable and worst of all made by A Has been and Sympathizer at best and at worst an Actual "Red".The fact euroPeons would tell you it was the best of all the time should make anybody run and laugh at such an elitist smug assertion.All it is a hit piece on Hearst of course it was going to be controversial and in the end cater only to bleeding heart Fascistliberals,Like The Wizard of Oz and Gone with The Wind it has been labeled a Masterpiece when in fact it is nothing but Long, Boring and Anemic.</p></body></html>

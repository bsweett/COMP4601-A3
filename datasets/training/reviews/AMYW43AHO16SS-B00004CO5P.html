<meta name="summary" content="A Great American Movie!"></head><body><p>This is one of the most historically acurate films about the Civil War.  Not only that, it's one of the best acted and best shot movie in many years.  Denzel Washington's performance is worth the Oscar he recieved.  Matthew Broderick and Morgan Freeman are also exceptional.  It's an unforgetable film about an event that changed the course of history.</p></body></html>

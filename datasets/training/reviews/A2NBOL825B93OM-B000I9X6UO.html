After all, he was responsible for the transformation of  the dark and gothic Batman stories into colorful little adventures (with nipples). In fact, after "Falling down (1993)", Schumacher's career seemed to be falling apart, even if he had opportunity to work with good scripts ("Time to kill" and "8mm") and good actors (Nicholas Cage, Robert deNiro, Anthony Hopkins).<p>The thing is, "Phone booth" worked very well with me. Up-coming superstar Colin Farrell, once again being comprehensible as an american character, is Stu Shepard, a busy PR in New York City. He's married, and has a girlfriend. So that his wife doesn't find out he's calling the girlfriend on the cell phone, he makes those "low profile calls" on a phone booth. The story of "Phone booth" develops as Stu is leaving the phone booth after calling the girlfriend; then the phone rings, and he's compelled to pick it up. After that, he's drawn into a nightmare appearently without any reason to be happening. <p>Simply made, filmed in only 12 days, "Phone booth" makes you seat on the edge of the seat the whole 90 minutes. Almost the entire story revolves around the booth. Schumacher uses a resourse you've seen plenty in Brian dePalma's movies: dividing the screen in aas many as four sections, so you can see different angles of what is happening at the same time. This works very well. Also, Kiefer Sutherland's voice as the sniper, the good performance by Farrell, together with good but smaller performances by Forrest Whitaker (as the negotiation cop) and pretty Katie Holmes (as Stu's girlfriend) make the movie go in a crescendo of thrilling sensations and exquisite feelings that are a pre-requisite for a good movie with the purpose of "Phone booth". <p>You will only be able to think after the movie. While you are watching, pay attention, so you won't loose anything. Schumacher got it right this time. <p>Grade 9.0/10</p></body></html>

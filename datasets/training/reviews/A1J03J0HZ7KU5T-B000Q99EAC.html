<meta name="summary" content="The Comeback Kid"></head><body><p>One of the biggest surprises in recent cinema, "Rocky Balboa" recaptures the heart and spirit of the 1976 Oscar winner. The 16-year hiatus adds graceful poignancy to the aging Philly underdog - a quality lacking in the previous sequels. Sylvester Stallone delivers an affecting performance as the iconic boxer who defies skepticism by taking on the current heavyweight champion (Antonio Tarver) in a Vegas exhibition match. As writer-director, Stallone bounces back from the pitfalls of sequelitis by making a detailed character study that gives his famous creation a stirring finale. Against all odds, "Rocky Balboa" emerges as a minor triumph.</p></body></html>

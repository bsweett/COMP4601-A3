<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing Digital Transfer Ruins An American Classic"></head><body><p>Lawrence of Arabia is the thinking man's epic, a brilliant adaptation of the life of an English patriot and the Arab revolt captured brilliantly by director David Lean. Peter O'Toole is marvelous.  Alec Guinness superb.  Omar Shariff, enigmatic and compelling.  This film really represents a high point in 60's American cinema and film in general.<br />That Columbia Home Video chose to restore the film to its original length and Technicolor glory back in the 1980's is commendable.  That they mucked up the DVD transfer is irreprehensive.<br />Although color fidelity is stunning, edge enhancement, aliasing and shimmering fine details plague this transfer throughout.  It's frustrating to try and indulge in a story when the whole background surrounding the characters is in a constant state of motion.  There are many scenes free from these annoying problems but just as many ravaged by them.<br />Extras, a documentary, featurette, trailers and more are ample but presented with a considerable degree of edge enhancement as well. Also, the collector's keep case has trouble closing.  Overall, this two disc set could have been a much more stirring visual experience.  What a shame!</p></body></html>

I guarantee that anyone who sees this film will not in the least be interested in the plot, nor will they invest in any of the characters. They will see this film only to watch Bruce Willis engage in combat, dodge explosions, and perform daredevil stunts. This film accomplishes exactly what it set out to accomplish, and for that, I suppose a four-star rating is appropriate. But keep in mind that not everyone will appreciate this kind of filmmaking; it may be an escapist movie, but goodness gracious, how many action sequences can an audience handle in one sitting?<br /><br />In all fairness, I appreciated that this film wasn't bogged down with details from the first three "Die Hard" films. Anyone who hasn't seen them will have nothing to worry about; the character development in this new film remains exactly the same, and there are no continuing plotlines. In other words, anyone new to this series doesn't have to bother with renting the first three films. What a relief; you pretty much get three films worth of action in this one, anyway. I can't recall a recent film that was so aggressive, so overloaded with eye candy that it overwhelms everything else. Maybe that's why, on some strange level, it works; it never stops to take a breath, and thus doesn't allow the audience to move back from the seat's edge.<br /><br />But there's absolutely nothing to get out of the story, something so implausible and ambiguous it begs the question of why the filmmakers even bothered with a screenplay. The plot can basically be described in one sentence: NYPD officer John McClane (Willis) and computer hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) go after cyber-terrorist Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), a man systematically gaining control of the country's power supplies. There's really nothing more about the story that needs to be explained. For that matter, there's nothing about the story to understand; Gabriel's motives are a complete mystery throughout most of the film, and by the time they are revealed, we really don't care anymore. It all boils down to the fact that he's the bad guy, and the good guy is trying to stop him. It doesn't get any more basic than that.<br /><br />The progression of scenes is essentially guided by the potential for action; most scenes featuring McClane begin normally before turning into frenetic battles. In one scene, he's assigned to find Farrell and bring him in for questioning. As soon as Farrell is found, the scene becomes engulfed in gunfire; someone has sent assassins to kill Ferrell. Later on, they drive on a road in Washington, D.C. The traffic lights are eventually taken over by Gabriel, resulting in numerous car accidents, ugly pileups, and more shooting. And then they find themselves in a long tunnel. Gabriel attempts to kill them by allowing cars to enter from both ends. For extra fun, the tunnel lights are shut down. I can't begin to explain the significance of any of this. Then again, I suppose an explanation isn't necessary.<br /><br />Thrown into the mix is McClane's daughter, Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a character who adds nothing to the film other than an excuse to create extra conflict. She only uses about twenty minutes of screen time, the first five of which establishes that she and her father aren't getting along (she hates using his last name). The other fifteen minutes sees her in Gabriel's evil clutches, and of course, McClane has to save her. When compared to the film's entire length of 130 minutes, I think it's easy to understand why her character is insignificant. This isn't to say that her character hurts the film; the action is far too abundant for any of the characters to be troublesome. Quite simply, this is not a character-driven film. Even the inclusion of Kevin Smith as a caricature hacker doesn't change things too much.<br /><br />So then what is this film driven by? That's easy. It's driven by cars that fly upwards and ram operating helicopters. By semi trucks that zoom across collapsing freeway overpasses. By shootouts, explosions, fighting, and characters hanging from perilous heights. By Willis having yet another opportunity to say, "Yippie ki yay [expletive deleted]." Everything is quick, loud, and in your face. Whether or not it's actually entertaining is open for debate; some will be thoroughly entertained while others will be begging for aspirin when the end credits start to roll. I don't dare reveal which category I fall into; believe me, it's enough that I'm actually giving this film four stars.<br /><br />But I'd be lying if I said that I took this film seriously. There's nothing about it that indicates seriousness, which I'm sure is exactly what the filmmakers wanted. "Live Free or Die Hard" is definitely a mindless film, but at the very least, it's a mindless film that knows what it's doing. Therefore, it delivers exactly as it promises. No attention was given to anything other than the entertainment factor; audiences sure like to see things blowing up and people flying through the air. If this is what you crave from a movie going experience, then by all means, go see this movie.</p></body></html>

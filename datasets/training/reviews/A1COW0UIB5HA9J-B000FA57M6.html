An elite military team from Earth led by Sarge ( Dwayne Johnson a.k.a. The Rock)with Reaper ( Karl Urban) and the crew go to Mars to investigate these strange murders done by the creatures and must outwit then terminate these hellish creature whom can also make people into zombies.<br /><br />Inspired by the popular game series, this is a very entertaining and action packed Sci-fi horror action thriller with decent acting and cool monster effects by the legendary Stan Winston ("Jurassic Park", "Predator" and "Aliens"). The movie may not have much brains but plenty of brawn to please the action lover anywhere and the unrated cut is even better with more gore than before, the special effects are very good and there's a very cool "First Person shooter" sequence which makes you feel like your in the game, this is one of the better game adaptations with "Resident Evil" and "Mortal Kombat" unlike Uwe Boll's films, "Street Fighter" or "Super Mario Brothers".<br /><br />The Unrated DVD has footage not shown in the original theatrical cut and has some good extras like a look at the "First Person Shooter" sequence in the movie, a look on the creation of the monsters, a featurette on how Sarge's monster make-up was made, a look on the phenomeneon that started it all, and behind the scenes.<br /><br />Leave your brain at the door and have a good time with "Doom", recommended if you like no-brainer action flicks, Sci-fi with horror in it, "Total Recall", "Starship Troopers", "Aliens" and "Predator".</p></body></html>

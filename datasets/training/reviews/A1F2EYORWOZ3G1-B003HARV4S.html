The music fits perfectly. The story is weak... at least that part which we are privy to. And that is the problem here.<br /><br />We, the audience, are not privy to anything. We are entertained by the illusionist throughout the story... not even a crumb of something is thrown at us with which to relish. We know less than half the characters in the story.<br /><br />Only until the final 5 minutes are we given any sort of explanation. And I feel we are cheated by that. What is never explained are the ghost-like figures that The Illusionist summons up in his performances and which he uses to escape by. Not a nice thing to do guys... after all... you are playing to us.<br /><br />What I did like was the costumes and sets.... brilliant and very eloquent. It was reminiscent of Doctor Zhivago in that the period was displayed very well.<br /><br />The acting was very very good also. Norton and the rest played well off each other in a very convincing manner.<br /><br />But... the story lacks. And to have a quick, flashback style explanation was insulting, hence the low points. If you're going to have a mystery, Agatha Christie is the only one privy to behind the scenes development. And even she fully explained things in the end. This one didn't.</p></body></html>

All I knew about it that it was unique, due to all the hype. I have to admit that it was pretty good no lie. Whether you like Roberto Rodriguez, Frank Miller, and Quentin Tarantino or whether you don't, this film raises the bar for comic book and comic book concept movies for the future. This trio made a gritty masterpiece of this underground comic book hit! They have perfected stylist zed violence; they have sniggered and winked and done the secret handshake about guns, and knives, and beating each other to a pulp, and rape, and how all of this adds up to some masculine heroic ideal.<br /><br /> I mean if you've seen the trailers in the past you knew that something new and excitingly was coming. And once you've seen the movie, it is amazingly hard to get the film noir images out of your head. The cast list is incredible: from Josh Hartnett in the opening sequence to Bruce Willis's exposition of the back story, to Mickey Rourke as "Marv", then to the smoking hot Clive Owen as "Dwight", this is a man's movie. Testosterone and adolescent male fantasies drive this convoluted tale of urban corruption. In fact, experiencing this movie is a bit like being inside the adolescent male mind in a dream-like state.<br /><br />I'm naturally bothered by the obvious male fantasy that all women (in the movie, of course) are hookers or strippers, all at least half-naked or wearing thongs and fishnet stockings. "All women", except for an eleven-year old girl-- almost a rape victim--, who grows up to be Jessica Alba the stripper. Most are victims, and even Rosario Dawson, playing strong-- even dominatrix, has to wait for Clive Owen to show up to rescue her. This is one movie that makes me almost thankful for "political correctness" outside the theater. Beside that visually and cinematographically the movie is genius you must own this DVD.</p></body></html>

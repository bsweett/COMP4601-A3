<meta name="summary" content="Strictly a Movie Review"></head><body><p>This opinion is based strictly on viewing the movie, not the bonus features of the DVD.  It's one of the few Johnny Depp DVDs I don't plan on adding to my collection as, in spite of his frighteningly good performance, it's really mediocre fare.  I kept waiting for a golden toned alto voice to inform me that I was watching, "Lifetime: Television for Women."<br /><br />Depp is so consistently good, it would be easy to take him for granted...but that's what makes him great.  He even rises above this mundane "Night Gallery" episode to make it a fun 97 minutes.  The talented supporting cast is largely wasted and most of the way you wonder if you're not watching a sequel to "Misery."<br /><br />I can't imagine the bonus features are special enough to make this one to own.  It's strictly for Depp and/or Stephen King fans and those rainy Saturday afternoons when you're curled up wanting some minor goosebumps.</p></body></html>

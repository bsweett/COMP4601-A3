For those of you who follow my reviews, you know that I like most things that have to do with Batman. As a child, I really liked the Adam West episodes. Sadly, Adam West's wonderful series was cancelled after only 3 seasons. Well, 20 years later, Tim Burton would ressurect Batman. Obvioulsy, it wasn't the 60s anymore. It was the 80s. And Tim Burton did a really great job of bringing back some of the original foundation, but at the same time bringing enough of his own dark and gothic signatures into the picture to allow Batman to transcend into the 80s. Well, all of that said, Michael Keaton did a great job of respecting Adam West's patterns, but at the same time not copying him. Keaton does in fact capture the essence of the loose and easy going Bruce Wayne and the dark, serious, and very sad Batman. Gough is excellent as the ever loyal Alfred. While Gough does remain faithful to the role, he does add a side of Alfred where he says things now and then that Bruce Wayne//Batman may not want to hear. Jack Nicholson did a very good job of taking the baton from Cesar Romero and bringing the Joker into the 80s. And I certainly did not mind the new element that the Joker was a loyal second in command to a crime boss, who was double crossed, but somehow came out of it alive and flipped the tables. Nicholson also made sure we realized that while the elements of psychosis were brewing before the double cross, they did not come into play until AFTER the double cross. Bassinger is fine as the lady in Bruce Wayne // Batman's life who carries some intelligence, purpose, and dignity. Alexander Knox is fine as the character who in doing his job crosses the path of Bruce Wayne // Batman. Finally, the scenery, musical tracks, suspense, and acting are all top notch. My only real complaint (and why I am deducting a half star) is that the final fight between Batman and Joker lacks a climactic edge. (I would like to say look at the fight between Patrick Swayzee and Jimmy in "RoadHouse"), but I'll keep it closer to home. Look at the confrontation in the episode "Joker Is Wild." Cesar Romero's Joker made his own utility belt, and there was a brutal nearly even fight between him and Batman in the end. In an animated episode, Kevin Conroy's Batman, and Mark Hamil's Joker had a brutal fight on a roller coaster, and after some wrestling,the Joker had Batman pinned down. Batman got in a lucky kick, and the Joker fell screaming. But that said, we must thank Tim Burton not only for bringing the character of Batman back from the 60s, but paving the way for the excellent animated series that were to follow. If you like this movie, be sure to see Part 2 "Batman Returns."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="pretty good way to spend a couple of hours"></head><body><p>As round four in the Die Hard Series Live Free or Die Hard has the same general mix of bad guys with their evil plot never quite what it seems (and it's really always about money), the outlandish action scenes and super cop (McClane) who never seems to stop going no matter how much he gets hurt. I actually think the plots are fairly plausible, however unlikely, and pretty well thought out- the movies have all been fun to watch, this one is no different.<br /><br />I watched the unrated version and had no complaints except to say that I never found the music video and commentary that are listed as being on the DVD, where are they? One commentary that I didn't try out- no other extras at all, not even a chapter list or behind the scenes mini feature. Just a little more stuff would have helped make the movie an even better value.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="MACHETE Kills"></head><body><p>** Couple of SPOILERS (shouldn't matter, but I warned ya) ahead **<br /><br />The fake trailer to MACHETE was probably the highlight for me of GRINDHOUSE (2007) the intermittently entertaining Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino homage to 1970s exploitation cinema. Heck, all the trailers were cool and I'm glad to have HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN (best title of all time) to look forward to as well. Kind of weird though that anything more came out of that film, which received mixed critical response and generally poor box office. Well, I'm glad that Rodriguez said damn the critics and the public and went ahead with this, because MACHETE - though not exactly a masterpiece - easily beats out either of the two original GRINDHOUSE features, and helps to show, if there were any real doubt, that though QT may talk the exploitation talk (and talk, and talk...), it's his Texan buddy who walks the walk.<br /><br />The opening could not be any better: a splatter and nudity-filled prologue to the film proper, as federale Machete (Danny Trejo channelling DEATH WISH 3-era Charles Bronson with pretty near total success) wipes out a dozen henchmen of drug kingpin Torrez (Steven Seagal), mostly with his weapon of choice but also with anything that comes in handy including an automatic with chopped-off hand still attached - but doesn't manage, at the end to save his wife from the same kind of fate that befalls most of his adversaries. Somehow he manages to escape a serious-looking cut to his groin area and the burning of the house; like a Bronson character, he doesn't need to vow revenge, we know he'll get it somehow.<br /><br />Cut to several years later, as ex-cop Machete is now earning a living as a day laborer in Texas. A far right-wing state Senator (Robert DeNiro) is in collusion with a group of Minutemen-type vigilantes led by Don Johnson, and greasy Jeff Fahey hires Machete to kill him for loads of cash, which the taciturn tough guy instead gives to Luz (Michelle Rodriguez), owner of a taco stand and....<br /><br />oh the heck with it. What's the point of going on about the plot?  A complex, involving story is not why you are watching this movie!  Suffice it to say that rough-looking, heavily tattooed and deep-voiced Machete spends most of the time cutting people up and blowing them away; we get to see him cut a guy open, pull out the intestine (a couple of minutes after a helpful lecture by a doctor) and then swing out a window with the unfortunate dude's organ as a rope; we get to see weedwhackers in action, a motorcycle-mounted gatling gun, a double-machete vs double-katana duel, a long soliloquy by a dying villain before he deliberately twists the blade imbedded in him all around his insides - you get the picture. And we get plenty of nudity and just-about, in the eye-candy form of Ms. Rodriguez, Jessica Alba, and Lindsay Lohan - among others. And a plot with some pretense of seriousness (the corruption of immigration/border issues) that is essentially jettisoned for action 75% of the time - in the best exploitation style.<br /><br />MACHETE does run out of steam a bit, though it's mostly because Rodriguez and codirector Ethan Maniquis just want to pack too much in I think - a couple too many characters (we've also got Cheech Marin as Machete's shotgun-toting priest brother, Tom Savini as a hitman hired to stop Machete, lots of comic bits involving Fahey's henchmen and a few of Machete's allies, etc) and a last act that's just too drawn out and inevitable, even if we do get some excellent death scenes out of it. The acting isn't really "good", but should you expect it to be? No, not really. Fahey really seems to get his role and seems like he could fit right in as a slimeball in a 1973 blaxploitation film with Pam Grier or Jim Kelly; Cheech is good as well though he's not onscreen enough. And Seagal plays his villainous overlord exactly the same way he plays half the cop characters he's done - with arrogance and disdain - but it seems to work better in this kind of role I think. I wish more had been made of the 60something, not exactly handsome Machete getting to make it with every hot babe in the film - but maybe it's just as funny that it's not overdone; after all, we're used to stuff like this in every other action movie, Trejo happens to be just a bit more obviously outside of the male model category than Sean Connery or Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />All in all, it's pretty damn fun. The tilt here is more towards action than satire, as opposed to last year's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BWP3W0">Black Dynamite</a> which is drawing some comparisons. That film was one of my favorites of 2009, and though this might not make my top 10 for 2010, I'm glad there are a few people around who still know how to do something like old-school action - even if they do have to resort to parody to get it done.  Now I just need to get ahold of some Mexploitation flicks.<br /><br />Long live Danny Trejo!</p></body></html>

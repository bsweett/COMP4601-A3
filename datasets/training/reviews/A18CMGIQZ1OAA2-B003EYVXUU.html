<meta name="summary" content="i love this movie"></head><body><p>what can i say. i didnt know what to expect with let me in.  i love vampire movies of all kinds.  im even a twilight geek (this movie is not like that just incase your anti twilight or pro twilight, its a horror movie. gory and not the least bit funny or magical).  when abby and her "father" come in town like a gusty breeze in the night, they have "laying it low" written all over them.  the neighbor boy in their aparment complex sees them though. hes being brutalized at school by a band of bullies. way past the point of a shove in a hallway. though she fights it abby forms a friendship with the boy and later go steady.  but see abbys not really a girl. shes a blood thirsty vampire who frankly looks like the little girl from the exorcist and turns into a primal blood lusting animal if she doesnt get fed. when shes ok shes a kid tho frankly wants to be a kid.  she knows she cant be. to my that was a hard sadness in the movie.  though your seeing innocent people getting murdered throughout the movie at the same time your constantly reminded that she doesnt like it and that she is very much "cursed".  another hard part is that most of the people who are killed are teenagers and most of them arent bad people.  just a nother movie to remind me you gotta look in the backseat before you get in the car.  just like the old urban legend. there may be someone back there.</p></body></html>

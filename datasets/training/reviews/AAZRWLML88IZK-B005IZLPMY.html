<meta name="summary" content="Captain America: The First Avenger"></head><body><p>Captain America put the finishing touches on a triumphant summer for Marvel that included hits Thor and X-Men: First Class and successfully bridged the gap to next summer's much anticipated Avengers movie. Directed by Joe Johnston and starring a surprisingly heroic Chris Evans in the title role, Captain America plays out the origin story of Steve Rogers, a scrawny but determined military recruit who signs up for a secret super-soldier program, only to be faced by the threat of the evil HYDRA organization and its leader Red Skull, another recipient of the super-soldier treatment. Though I was initially a bit unsure what exactly to expect from the film, I enjoyed it. It's solidly old-fashioned blockbuster entertainment with pulpy action, a retro vibe, and some fine acting performances. Even if Captain America wasn't your favorite comic hero, chances are you'll have a pretty good time with this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Message of Profound Importance Delivered by a Brilliant Ensemble"></head><body><p>DOUBT succeeds on every level - from the fine transference of Patrick Shanley's play to the screen (Shanley wrote the play, the screenplay, and directs) to the atmospheric cinematography excursion through the Bronx of the mid 1960s to the detailed delineation of the characters by Meryl Streep, Viola Davis, Amy Adams, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and even young Joseph Foster, to the careful editing.  It would be difficult to imagine a finer cast, here cast in roles counter to their usual types, bringing such power to the poetry of Shanley's lines.<br /><br />The story is well known by now (the dismissal of a progressive priest by a crotchety old Catholic school principal over a false rumor and all the 'doubt ' that brings into play in every character), but multiple viewings of this film intensify the humanity of each of the characters and demonstrate just how fine a writer Shanley is. The subject matter is difficult at first but the manner in which each of these superb actors (under the guidance of Shanley's direction) explore the effects of spite and loathing and forgiveness shares some of the finest ensemble acting in years.

Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise) works for pre-crime, a new agency designed to prevent all killings and murder in the District of Columbia. John believes in the system, it is perfect. But just a few days before the spreading of Pre-Crime all over the States, something unexpected happens. The three pre-cogs of Pre-Crime foresee the murder of a certain Leo Crowe by none other than John Anderton! Not even knowing who the victims is, John flees to try to unravel the mystery. Little does he know that as he begins to dig up the past, he discovers the unthinkable, that the system is not as perfect as he believes...<p>I went to see "Minority Report" just recently with high expectations for it. From all I've heard from the reviews, I was all up and ready to finally see it. I was at first VERY discouraged at the opening sequence which was to me undeniable scary, but as the film progressed I found myself very intrigued by the interesting and well-thought out plot, the exciting and breathtaking action, and body tensing suspense.<p>Steven Spielberg again does a marvelous job as the director of the film. But the film was all Tom Cruise's as each and every scene he gives such a strong role as John Anderton. He acts exceptionally well and gives a great performance with lots of character development. Also knowing that he did most of his stunts also earned a bit more respect from me. Another performance which cannot be passed by without mentioning was Colin Farrell as Witwer. Though he is somewhat like the bad guy at first, I really loved his role. Also starring is Max von Sydow as the Director of Pre-Crime, Lamar Burgess, and Samantha Morton as the pre-cog, Agatha.<p>The plot is what really makes the movie so mesmerizing. I thought the whole story was well-thought out and the whole idea about Pre-Crime is interesting. At some points the story seemed a bit like it was dragging but was soon picked up with lots of action and suspense. When the movie finally tells why John Anderton was supposed to kill Leo Crowe, I was shocked! The conclusion for me was very satisfying though some have said it was a bit disappointing. Not your usual happy ending but was in a way still satisfying. <p>The effects and action sequences were very well done. I loved all of the futuristic gadgets and new technology, especially the cars, advertisements, using the eyes for identification, and more. The action scenes were also very exciting. I especially liked the part where Tom Cruise was being chased down by his fellow agents in the alley. <p>But the movie for me did have its disappointments. For a PG-13 movie I thought that the people stretched the limitations to the very edge, making me wonder if the movie was really rated R. Like I said, the opening sequence was undeniable scary and a bit grotesque. And though it does get a bit better, the movie has its scary moments and some parts were very violent. In addition, some scenes were unnecessary and should have been cut out. Hence my reason for taking off one star, but only one star since the acting, directing, and story give a five star movie.<p>So my recommendation is to try renting the movie before buying it. And if you can't handle scary or violent movies, I suggest you stay away from "Minority Report". But if you're looking for excitement where you can actually think through the movie, check this movie out!</p></body></html>

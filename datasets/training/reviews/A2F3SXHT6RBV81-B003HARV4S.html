<meta name="summary" content="THE ILLUSIONIST (not no title available--  why do  they do that"></head><body><p>Edward Norton was really quite something as the illusionist in Vienna at the turn of the century (200 years ago).  Along the vein of today's David Copperfield, he was master at making things and people appear and disappear.  He looked the part of Eisenheim and had attracted a devoted following as he developed seemingly supernatural powers.  He'd acquired an eloquent old theatre in which to entertain his fans and, by the way, he looked the part in every way -- at first.<br /><br />It was all a trick, an illusion, as he delved into the dark arts whereby fate could just be chance.  Jessica Biel made a good Hungarian princess, a bit dumb.  After his childhood love re-enters his life, he seems to fall apart.  She's been claimed by the crown prince of Austria who is planning to overthrow his father.  Telling everything was out of this question at this point, but Sophie knew his secret.  She had dreamed about E. for fifteen years and hoped to see him again (now, you have, he'd said).  "Why should you care what happens to me now -- why?"  His sincere reply: "my heart couldn't let go of you."  He was sure that he had charmed her again.<br /><br />Then, we are led on a road of treachery, murder, abuse, coverup -- or is it all an illusion.  You must see the ending and figure it out for yourself.  He was believeable as he expanded his repertorie to manifestations and spiritualism in his attempts to contact the dead with the use of mirrors.  He was surrounded by fools; I think I am going to enjoy this.  He loses his looks of professionalism and appeared to disappear, or did he?  As an ordinary passenger on the night train, he looked very ordinary, not dapper at all in his disguise.  The crown prince could not face the music and was trapped because of his mean temperament.  He got what he asked for.  Who was betrayed?  What does it mean to die?  It's not that easy; he couldn't let her go -- neither of them could or would.  My apologies, of course,  You never did understand what exactly had happened.  I couldn't figure out why.  How did he manifest those blue butterflies, what was their significance.  The costumes and the expert acting made this movie a classic.  You've got to see it to believe it.</p></body></html>

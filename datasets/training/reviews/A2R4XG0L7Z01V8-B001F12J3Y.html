<meta name="summary" content="Can you still hear the bell ringing?"></head><body><p>For a 21-year-old, it's been a long time since I believed in Santa. It was getting a bit stupid when I got told Santa didn't come down the chimney in our house (as we didn't have a chimney), he came in through the front door, which my parents left unlocked for him. OK then. And my mum always left out sherry for Santa, which she would then drink. And I get freaked out by these people who dress up as Santa to entertain the kids. He's not real. Does that mean I'm not going to get any presents this year? No. Cos they're sitting upstairs that's why.<br /><br />But for me, this film made me feel like I should still believe in the big Mr C, simply because of the magical, sweet ending. It meant so much, and showed how much you have grown up when you watch it. Just a simple thing like a bell ringing means you believe in Santa or you don't.<br /><br />I'm always a bit iffy around animated movies, simply because now I'm older, I notice the lip synch doesn't match etc. But I didn't notice it here. And in fact it was so well done, that I actually felt like I was watching a real movie with real actors. Also, it had all the classic 'moments' from cartoons in there. You never saw adults' faces and no one is given really proper names.<br /><br />Tom Hanks does a lot of the voices, and is the characters in this, and it's absolutely amazing how they managed to pick up his facial expressions. The animated character(s) even look like Tom Hanks. He voices these characters: Hero Boy, Father, Conductor, Hobo, Scrooge, and Santa Claus. I didn't really get the character of the Hobo, I thought he was originally going to be Santa, but he appears & disappears. That was really the only character I wasn't sure about. And Eddie Deezen also voices the know-it-all kid, who appeared in Grease, as wait for it, a geek!!! Even the kid looks pretty similar to how he did in Grease, just with lighter hair.<br /><br />There's a lot of bits relating to Robert Zemeckis' other big film Back To The Future. In a news photo of Santas on strike, their placards say they're picketing Lone Pine Mall. Hero Boy says, "I've wanted to do that my whole life," after tugging on the trains whistle. This is the same thing Doc Brown says.<br /><br />The score is also magical, and has one of those memorable cues, that sounds so much like Edward Scissorhands, you'll actually think it was. It's a brilliant score by Alan Silvestri.<br /><br />It's a shame it's a Christmas movie, as it's so magical, it could be watched at anytime, but the obvious references to Santa etc, kinda means it can only be watched once a year. I can't wait for next year to watch it again. This will definitely be a film you'll watch year after year.</p></body></html>

I am a big fan of ALL of Ridley Scott's projects and even his weakest films (1942, Kingdom of Heaven) have had something of value in them in regards either their characters or story - but Prometheus - wow...I was a severe disappointment.<br /><br />Let me tell you what's good about it - It does have two really great performances by the creepy and mysterious Android David played amazingly and hauntingly by Michael Fassbinder (300, X-Men First Class) - and - the spaceships main scientist (Elizabeth Shaw) played by intensely and passionately by Noomi Rapace (Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo). These were some of the most dramatic highlights/scenes of the film.<br /><br />The story written by first time writer John Spaihts and Damon Lindeloff -(Cowboys & Aliens, Lost) - takes a giant leap from the original Alien four films and is trying to be a prequel to the entire franchise. The story is full of holes, the logistics of some of the action had the audience rolling their eyes in `you gotta be kidding' style. The theatrical trailer made me excited and eager to see this film - coupled with the fact it was directed by the `former' master of modern-day suspense Ridley Scott.  I was so disappointed. Yes it has Aliens - different in style, face-huggers that now look like octopuses and the incubation process is completely different - involving worms in the eyeballs! Need I say more?<br /><br />The Prometheus crew is assigned on a two-year long term mission to investigate a serious of pictographs found in various Earth cultures over centuries of time which leads them to the race of super tall beings (great CG effects here) that actually `seeded' Earth millennium's ago. Turns out - they - made a mistake - we don't know why - but apparently they create a biological weapon (i.e. the Aliens) to destroy their mistakes all over the universe - apparently.<br /><br />The special effects, the score by Marc Steitenfeld  (Gladiator, Black Hawk Down) and the cinematography by Dariusz Wolski (Pirates of the Caribbean, Sweeny Todd) are state-of-the-art, extremely realistic, very enchanting and incredibly imaginative. Using the production design that reminded my of the first two Alien films in a more cleaner and sleeker design. But this film lacked the story, realistic actions and the heart that the first two Alien films had and it was extremely unbelievable to me.<br /><br />Charlize Theron as the daughter of the mission financier (Snow White and the Huntsmen, Monster), Idris Elba as the Captain of the Prometheus (Thor, 28 Weeks Later) and a mission specialist Logan Marshal-Green (Across the Universe, Devil) all gave some not-so-impressive performances that made me appreciate the Android David (Fassbinder) and the Chief Scientist Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace) that much more.<br /><br />I wish it was better. I was hoping it would have been better. But this is a direct to video/DVD or Netflix film. Not worth $12 to $16! Not a lot of substance. Just a lot of special effects!</p></body></html>

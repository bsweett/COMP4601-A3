<meta name="summary" content="Bizzare Yet Hilarious"></head><body><p>I really wish that I could give half-star ratings, because I think this movie deserves 3 and a half stars instead of 4, but since I can't, I'll be generous and round up.<br /><br />This movie is (I think) Guy Ritchie's follow-up to Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels; it involves some of the same cast members and themes.  The movie follows the intersecting storylines of three main groups of people.  Criminals and boxing "promoters" Turkish (Jason Statham), his partner Tommy (Stephen Graham), and their prospects Gorgeous George (Adam Fogerty) and Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), who is a Pikey or a gypsy.  Then there are the jewel thieves Sol (Lennie James), Vinny (Robbie Gee), and their getaway driver Tyrone (Ade).  Also, there are the Denovitz cousins Avi (Dennis Farina) and Doug "The Head" (Mike Reid), their courrier "Four-Finger" Frankie (Benicio Del Toro), and their muscle "Bullet Tooth" Tony (Vinnie Jones).  Also, there are two characters who transcend the groups.  There is "Brick Top" Polford (Alan Ford) and Boris "The Blade" or Boris "The Bullet-Dodger" (Rade Serbedzija).  It would be very hard to condense the intertwining stories to fit into this review, so basically, there's this 86 carat diamond that the Denovitz brothers and Boris are both hunting down.  It falls into various characters hands throughout the film, as each character finds a need for it (besides the astronomical value of it).  For example, the jewel thieves need it to pay of Brick Top because they stole from him.<br /><br />The writing and acting for this movie were pretty good.  I mean, the story wasn't anything totally original, but Ritchie kept things interesting.  On the acting, yes, the actors did a good job, but due to thick British accents, I could barely hear a word they were saying.  As for Brad Pitt's character, the joke was that we nor the characters in the film were supposed to understand him.<br /><br />This film is definitely not for everyone.  While I don't see it as pure British humor, in order to enjoy it, one does need to at least be able to tolerate some British humor.  Also, not everyone will be able to follow the intersecting storylines.  But don't let me discourage you, this is a very funny movie.  I think it's one of those films where you either like it or you hate it.  So, enjoy.</p></body></html>

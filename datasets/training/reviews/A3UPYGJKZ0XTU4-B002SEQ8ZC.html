Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is an 11-year-old girl whose family has just moved into an apartment in a slightly dilapidated Victorian house. While her parents are busy finishing up work on a deadline, and it pours rain outside, Coraline is bored. Then she discovers a small door in the living room that has been papered over. At night the door leads to another house like hers, only better, with more attentive versions of her parents and perfected versions of her eccentric neighbors. Her Other Mother (Terry Hatcher) invites Coraline to stay in the other world, but there is high price to pay, and Coraline begins to suspect something sinister.<br /><br />Stop-motion animation was the choice for this film because it ages well. I couldn't agree more. "Coraline" looks fantastic and distinctive. It leaves a strong visual impression. I was reminded of "The Mascot" (1934), an early example of stop-motion that is as strong today as it was 75 years ago. I have not read the novel "Coraline", but I understand that the film has made significant changes, including that addition of a prologue in which we see mechanical hands creating a doll of Coraline. I'm grateful for that sequence, as it contains some of the film's most memorable animation. Like so many children's stories, there is a lesson imbedded in the tale. The film's tagline is "Be careful what you wish for". In the Other World, everything is exactly how Coraline would like it, for herself and for others. But it makes her value her real family all the more.<br /><br />There has been a lot of discussion about whether "Coraline" is actually a children's film. It is not graphic; there is no blood or guts. There are disturbing ideas which are enhanced by creepy imagery. I would caution that it is probably too scary for children under six. For 6-10-year-olds, it is an entirely individual matter. The book on which it is based is fantasy/horror intended for 9-12-year-olds. Some children like to be scared, and if your 8-year-old is one of those kids, "Coraline" might be just the thing. If your child is sensitive, you may not want to cope with the nightmares. It's a nice film for older children, because it encourages children to be bright and independent and never condescends to them. It doesn't have the thematic sophistication that makes many Pixar films equally suitable for adults. But "Coraline" is visually interesting enough that it won't bore adults either.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2009 single disc edition): The single disc edition has the 2-D film on one side of the disc and a 3-D version on the other. It comes with 4 pairs of glasses for viewing the 3-D. This isn't the same 3-D as was in movie theaters. That technology is not available for home viewing, so this version is the old blue-red 3-D. There is an audio commentary by director Henry Selick and composer Bruno Coulais on the 2-D side of the disc. This is a constant, information-packed commentary. Selick talks about the changes he made to the book, the look of the real world versus the other world, and a lot of technical information about filming and working with the puppets. Coulais joins the commentary near the end. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish, French. Dubbing available in Spanish, French.</p></body></html>

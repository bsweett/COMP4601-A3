<meta name="summary" content="In Ten Years Who Will Remember "The Forgotten"? I Won't"></head><body><p>Juliane Moore stars in this steaming celluloid melting pile of retardedness that takes everything bad about "The X Files" & stretches into an hour & forty five minute embarassment on how to properly screw up one's movie career.<br /><br />The film starts with Moore's character losing her young son. No, he didn't die he just "disappeared". She's told to believe he died in a plane crash. Thinking its all a cruel practical joke she confronts her husband portrayed by Anthony Edwards (its "Goose" from "Top Gun"!). Her husband doesn't know what she's ranting about because he knows they don't have children. She, of course, thinks otherwise and finds the father of one her sons friends who was also on "the plane".<br /><br />After some investigating both the mother & the friends father find out that the truth is out there & find out that both of their kids were abducted by aliens. In order to save her son, the mother must confront the aliens.<br /><br />My God did this movie suck major league ass. I couldn't believe it. If you took any episode from "The X Files" that dealt with Scully & her baby, twist some plot threads around here & there you would have "The Forgotten". Even the scene in the film where Woodard (there's a great cop. Not!) shoots the human alien in the back seven to ten times is taken directly from "The X Files"!<br /><br />Whats wrong with this film? Its a bit weird to see Moore and Edwards in the same movie as husband & wife. Why? They both worked together on "ER" years ago!<br /><br />The film wasn't scary or chilling at all.<br /><br />Where are the damn aliens?! The human equivalent doesn't count.<br /><br />I busted a gut laughing when the guy gets sucked up in the air after he says "They are listening." I was waiting for the Wicked Witch Of The West to show up!<br /><br />I could go on all day, but you get the drift.<br /><br />This movie lives up to its name. Whats the name of this film? Don't ask me, I've learned to forgive & forget.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A rare instance when a movie adaptation surpasses the book"></head><body><p>I remember reading Andre Dubus' "House Of Sand And Fog" a couple of years ago. While not among the best books I've ever read, I did find it to be an interesting and worthwhile read that stuck with me long after I finished the last page. And when I heard that it was becoming a movie adaptation my interest in the story was immediately renewed. Today I went to see it and can say without reservation that this is one of the very rare instances when a film version surpasses the novel. <p>Ben Kingsley gives yet another superb performance in his role as Colonel Behrani. Equally as convincing is Jennifer Connelly who plays Kathy Nicolo, the desperate and determined woman who will stop at nothing to claim her house back which Behrani has purchased at auction price because she neglected to pay her taxes on it. Both Kingsley and Connelly are simply excellent in their roles. Ron Eldard plays Sheriff Lester Burdon, a cop who is unhappily married and starts an affair with Kathy, taking her under his wing and promising to get her house back. I found Eldard's performance to be a little wooden at times but for the most part he pulled it off well.<p>The same amount of praise also goes to director Vadim Perelman and the rest of the crew who worked behind the scenes to give "House Of Sand And Fog" the perfect atmosphere and setting. The house used in the movie was EXACTLY how I had envisioned it as I read the book. <p>It should also be noted that this movie adaptation remains very faithful to the book with the exception of the ending which was a little different. For example, those of you who have read the book will notice that Behrani doesn't try to strangle Kathy in this movie version. There are other minor differences, especially during the final minutes, but to reveal them would give away the ending for those not familiar with the story.<p>To sum up, "House Of Sand And Fog" is definitely one of the better movies to come out this year that offers both a good story and great acting. Don't expect a happy ending because there is none; this story is about tragic people making tragic decisions. But it's an engaging plot nonetheless. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Well worth the wait, "Hero" finally plays in our land"></head><body><p>I feel like I have been waiting a long time to see this movie and that the trailer for "Hero" ("Ying xiong") has been teasing us for at least a year.  I have to admit that I fully expected to see an epic full of battle scenes and massed armies of men.  My mistake.  This film from China is a pointed fable, distilled from legend that may well be myth, and with a point that may well be lost on Western audiences.  This is clear from those viewers who are unwilling to accept the conventions of wire work in Chinese martial art pictures and whose standard of realism refuses to allow for the poetic ballet of combat.<br /><br />The prologue makes it clear that this story takes place in China before it was China, when the land was made up of seven warring provinces and the King of Qin (Chen Dao Ming) dreamt of conquering the other six provinces and uniting the land.  For years the king has been unable to have a peaceful night of sleep because there are three assassins who are out to kill him.  Now comes a nameless warrior (Jet Li), who has come to the imperial court to be rewarded for killing the three unbeatable assassins.  He is warned that he may not approach within 100 paces of the king or he will be killed.  But because he has bested the assassin Sky (Donnie Yen) in combat, he is allowed with 20 paces to tell his story.<br /><br />Most of the story of "Hero" is told in flashback as Nameless tells his stories and the king questions him.  We also learn of the fates of Broken Sword (Tony Leung) and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung), two assassins who were also a pair of lovers.  But there is more than one truth and more than one tale to be told in this film.  Director Zhang Yimou, improving on the artistry we first enjoyed in "Raise the Red Lantern," color codes the stories that we see.  First the story is told in lush shades of red, then in cool blue, again in white, and finally in green.  Drops of water and swirling yellow leaves all become parts of the dances of death during the fight sequences, captured by cinematographer Christopher Doyle.  "Hero" is a gorgeous film that uses its saturated colors better than any film of recent memory.  There is a code to the colors, but that is something you need to come to terms with on your own.<br /><br />Another strength of this film is that the fighting (choreographed by Wei Tung) and special effects do not overwhelm the actors who are required to play what is on some level the same scene as slightly different characters.  I know there are computer generated effects in this film, especially since there are more arrows shot in "Hero" than any film in history, but for once I did not get the feel that what I was seeing was not real.  That is become this film keeps coming back to questions of aesthetics, from the breathtaking use of color to the eloquent idea that swordsmanship and calligraphy are intrinsically awaited.<br /><br />Special mention has to be made of the music, composed by Dun Tan and featuring violin solos and fiddling by Itzhak Perlman along with drumming by the Japanese group Kodo.  I have never really seen one of those Hong Kong kung fu movies where everyone screams while they fight and I might never get around to it given the silent eloquence of the fights in movies like "Hero" (not to mention "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"), where the moments are underscored by the sound of clashing swords, pounding drums, and a violin.  "Hero" is an art film, albeit one made on a larger and more colorful canvas.<br /><br />"Hero" may be sold as being a big film but it is really about something relatively plain and simple.  I disagree with the idea that either the style or substance of the film is beyond our Western sensibilities.  Apparently the reason the film has the "Quentin Tarantino Presents" tag at the start was so that Miramax would not cut 20 minutes of the film out on the pretext that it too Asian/confusing for Western audiences.  Indeed, I have seen some critics who professes to be confused about the complex plot and I can only wonder if they were equally confused by "Rashomon," an obvious reference point to this one (in many ways Yimou owes more to Akira Kurosawa's classic film than to Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon").  Certainly after a century of cinema we are capable to looking at the same thing from multiple perspectives and enjoying this gem of a film that has finally made its way to our shores.</p></body></html>

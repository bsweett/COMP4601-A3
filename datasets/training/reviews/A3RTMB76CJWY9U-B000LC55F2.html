<meta name="summary" content="Dark, Well-Made Mystery Riddled with Twists"></head><body><p>Fans of Christopher Nolan's other classic--Memento--will know going in not to expect a straight-forward, cut-and-dried story.<br /><br />The Prestige, a film about two up-and-coming stage magicians locked in a violent feud, has more twists than Chubby Checker on speed. The narrative, jumping around in time and from character to character, might be slightly confusing at first but eventually you get a handle on it. The morality is murky through-out, fitting a shadow-filled and dark cinematography; this is a film of ambience and feeling, powerfully suspenseful.<br /><br />An all-star cast does a great job with the material, including a surprise performance by David Bowie as famous Edison-rival Nikola Tesla (!).<br /><br />Obviously, I cannot say too much here without giving away things that should be revealed over the course of viewing, so I'll leave it here. However what you're getting with The Prestige is: a fine-acted, well-directed, dark, twisty/turny suspense-filled mystery populated by characters with secrets and highly-questionable ethics. If that's your sort of thing (see: Memento), then you'll like this too.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Allen and Costner were great but....."></head><body><p>I am a fan of Joan Allen and Kevin Costner. Their acting was great in this movie, however, the plot and and the material they had to work with was lacking. Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen) has four daughters and when her husband disappears, evidentally running off with his young secretary, she becomes bitter, angry, and unbearably controlling of her daughters. Her husband's friend, Denny Davies (Kevin Costner) is a former baseball player and current radio personality. What just does not make sense is how Denny so easily works his way into Terry's life when Terry is so shattered by her husband's evident betrayal. It doesn't ring true. They start off as drinking buddies and quickly move into a romance. Denny makes some moves on Terry, such as sneaking into the bathroom while Terry is in the shower, which would never further a possible relationship. In real life, some of Denny's audatious behavior would lead to a restraining order against a character such as Denny. In the script, such behavior (albeit well acted by Costner) is not believable.<br /><br />To make this movie even more incomprehensible, Terry, her daughters, Denny and everyone else involved have misconceptions about Terry's husband. We have no clue as to how these misconceptions arose. It just isn't explained in any way. Each of Terry's four daughters is involved in her own subplot, giving Terry the opportunity to try to manipulate each one's life. Allen does a great job in playing the role of this angry, maniplative mother but, these subplots don't congeal due to a mediocre screen play. The writer & director, Mike Binder has a supporting role as Denny's low life producer and he does a fine acting job but his screen play and direction are lacking. Despite very good acting jobs, this movie receives only a lukewarm 3 star recommendation.</p></body></html>

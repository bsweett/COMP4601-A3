Tom Hanks gives an amazing performance and the movie consistently provides something to chew on.  You would never think that a person like Forrest Gump could be involved with so many things in his life, but he is, perhaps oblivious to the significance of it all, but you love him nonetheless.  There is hardship, but Forrest conquers all, and it ends nicely.  You are probably going to want to see this movie again at some point, so buying it may be a good idea.</p></body></html>

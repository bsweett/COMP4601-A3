It is on this premise that nice woman, Andrea "Andie" Sacks (Anne Hathaway) comes to the Big Apple from the greater Chicago Area in order to make it as a columnist at a major periodical.  After an awkward interview, she lands a big job at fashion magazine 'Runway,'. She has to settle as a receptionist, but really is more of a personal assistant to the leading lady, Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), whose every move makes or breaks the fashion industry.  Known as a "notorious sadist", Priestly lives to belittle and berate her subordinates.  "By all means, move at a glacial pace.  That always thrills me," Miranda chortles.  She creates great tension, and Andie must act like "Radar O' Reilly" with a clairvoyance to forecast every whim of her starchy employer.  We get the point ad nauseam, but there's enough variety in the film to transcend its problems and misery.  Sometimes they beat the idea to death, but the movie takes enough free time to ponder on the estate of things.  There's her boyfriend, Nate (Adrian Granier) and their friends who offer a relaxed atmosphere with a comraderie that rises above her fray.  On the other hand, there's the pressure to succeed and temptation from a vain competitor, Christian Thompson (Simon Baker).  The allure of success and a cosmopolitan man have her pondering between two roads.  (One road is the glory of high fashion; the other is down to earth.)  Less compelling is her competitive near superior, Emily (Emily Blunt) who seems to have worked so long for the franchise, she's acquired their bosses' accumen.  Almost implausibly, Andie comes to the defense of despicable people at her own expense.  (Is anyone that nice?)  Another supervisor high on the food chain is Nigel (played with proper bluster by Stanley Tucci), a blunt and fastidious figure who is the only one with enough humanity to eventually warm up to her.  Andie's smart and has a good work ethic, but the movie does a wonderful job presenting and sorting out her priorities.  Like the rest of us, many are tied to their cell phones like an ambilical chord.  Should she sever the ties or not?<br /><br />'The Devil Wears Prada' is a surprisingly fun movie with a presentation that rises above ordinary sit-com fare.  It also refuses to entirely demonize the enemy.  Andie, to their credit, gains some self-confidence as she succumbs to a fashion make-over.  The villains are also presented with frailties and decency behind their thick skin.  Meryl Streep gives a relaxed prima dona performance; one that also makes us see her believable vulnerability behind her fashion facade.  She seems to walk through the role (although this is only testimony to her brilliance).  Everyone else delivers good, solid performances throughout.  Not giving a fig about fashion, 'The Devil Wears Prada' is an enjoyable and thoughtful release from what I thought would have been an overly labored effort.</p></body></html>

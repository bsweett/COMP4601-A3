<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick's eye opening final film"></head><body><p>"Bill, suppose I told you that everything that happened to you there...suppose I said that all of that was staged, that it was a kind of charade? That it was fake?"<br /><br />Victor Ziegler's words explaining away the bizarre orgy that his friend, Dr. Bill Harford, crashed the night before might be a more accurate description of Warner Bros' marketing campaign for Stanley Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut."<br /><br />After Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, then a real-life couple, were cast in the lead roles, the media hype was that Kubrick's final film was about sex, jealousy, infidelity, and the pitfalls of temptation, all of which certainly seemed to be the theme judging by the trailer over which Chris Isaak was heard singing "Baby Did A Bad, Bad Thing." Most critics and the public swallowed the bait and saw the film with their own eyes wide shut.<br /><br />"Eyes Wide Shut" is not really about sex at all, nor is it about "the elusive ambiguity of dream and reality," as the back cover of the published screenplay claims.<br /><br />LIke most of Kubrick's films, "Eyes Wide Shut" is so rich and multi-layered that it requires multiple viewings before its meaning becomes clear. Even then, much of it remains mystifying. But this much can be understood: "Eyes Wide Shut" is an expose of the world's elite and the occultic rituals they engage in on a regular basis. The bizarre ritual that Tom Cruise's character witnesses is more than mere hedonism, hence the cloaks, the masks, and the bizarre, almost churchly music. It is a Satanic ritual, and Ziegler is right when he tells Harford he wouldn't sleep so well if he knew the names of those participating.<br /><br />Just as Ziegler tried to white-wash the events, the media deliberately tried to control the public's perception of Kubrick's film. Ziegler is a little more honest. He prefaces his remarks with the word "suppose," a hint to Harford and the audience that he's telling Harford a bit of fiction in the hope of dissuading him from pursuing the matter further.<br /><br />And what are we to make of Alice Harford's "dreams"? And what about the daugher of Milich, the costume shop proprietor, whose father doubles as her pimp?<br /><br />Alice's dreams are more likely flashbacks to real incidents when she was victimized by the government's MK-Ultra mind control program that was exposed in Congressional hearings and which Kubrick touched on in his 1971 film of Anthony Burgess' novel, "Clockwork Orange."<br /><br />One question is how did Kubrick ever manage to make "Eyes Wide Shut" for a studio which is believed to be controlled by the very kind of people he was exposing?<br /><br />Following the success of "2001: A Space Odyssey," Kubrick was in an enviable position. Warner Bros. lured the world's most innovative filmmaker to their stable by offering him carte blanche. Kubrick's clout was such that he could even convince the studio to withdraw the very profitable and critically acclaimed "Clockwork Orange" from UK cinemas when he feared his family would be targets of violence from those who misunderstood the film. Kubrick was free to make the films of his choosing without interference from the studio, and always worked under strict security, keeping the nature of his work a secret even from those who were providing the budget. It's doubtful Warner Bros. realized what Kubrick had achieved with "Eyes Wide Shut" until they saw the finished film four months before its release. But like Cruise's Dr. Harford, Kubrick may have wandered out of his depth. On March 7, 1999, only four days after Warner Bros. got its first glimpse at the much ballyhooed production, Kubrick unexpectedly died, exactly 666 days before the dawn of 2001, the year he made famous with his landmark 1968 film.<br /><br />Yes, 666 as in the mark of the beast.<br /><br />Coincidence? Conspiracy?<br /><br />Aside from its themes, "Eyes Wide Shut" is as impressive as all of Kubrick's films. The production design, cinematography, and music are as flawless as they are unforgettable. The performances are also top notch. Tom Cruise, whose acting skills are often dismissed, is at his best here, playing a man whose jealousy leads him down a path where he learns much more than he suspected about the circles in which he socializes. Kidman is good, too, though she has some early moments when she unconvincingly overacts. Pollock as Ziegler shows he's still a better actor than a director (though he's not too shabby behind the camera either), and there's Leon Vitali, who played Lord Bullingdon in "Barry Lyndon" before working behind-the-scenes on Kubrick's last three films, as the sinister Red Cloak.<br /><br />"Eyes Wide Shut" may be Kubrick's most daring work. It is certainly one of his finest. If your own eyes remain shut to the truths of this film, it's recommended you see it again, this time as a double feature with Alex Jones' "Inside Bohemian Grove," available on DVD with the equally informative "Order of Death."<br /><br />Brian W.

Denziel Washington provides his usual superior performance as gangster / drug lord Frank Lucas. It's his storyline that makes the film worth watching. The role of honest cop Ritchie Roberts portrayed by Russell Crowe is the weaker of the two merging storylines but when the two finally come face to face late in the film everything comes together in grand fashion.<br /><br />My Rating: Worth a watch if you're a Washington or Crowe fan, into gangster films, or just curious about the socio-political climate in the `60's; -4 Stars-.</p></body></html>

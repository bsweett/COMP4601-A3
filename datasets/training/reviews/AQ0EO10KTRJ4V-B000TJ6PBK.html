<meta name="summary" content="Stephen King films still cursed"></head><body><p>The first 30 minutes of this film set a good dark creepy atmosphere, then just turned silly.<br />The attempts at Scary simply were overdone to the point of becoming comical.<br />My wife was laughing.<br />Cusak's acting was good considering what he had to work with.<br /><br />Stephen King is one of the top horror writers of our generation and deservedly so, but he seems to have his own curse.......... meaning almost every attempt to translate his stories to the big screen fail.<br /><br />The premise of the film was good but it seems they tried too hard to use special effects and eye candy to create terror and thus it lost it's edge and became ho-hum.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ratatouille"></head><body><p>Remy (Oswalt) is a rat who wants to be a chef.  He has refined senses and refuses to eat the garbage that other rats eat.  They use him as a "poison detector", a job which he despises.  One day, he meets Linguini (Romono), a janitor at Gusteau's, a famous Paris restaurant.  Hiding under his hat, Remi can manipulate Linguini into creating amazing dishes.  Soon, everyone is talking about this new chef, but the chef whose position he has usurped (Holm) wants revenge.  Renowned food critic Anton Ego (O'Toole) is also reviewing the restaurant, and Remi and Linguini may be in over their heads.<br /><br />"Ratatouille" is the latest in the string of great movies from Pixar.  It's a notch below last year's "Cars", but still better than the majority of animated movies that have come out in the last decade.  The humor works on two levels as has become Pixar's standard.  Kids and adults alike will enjoy this film.  The voice talents are mostly lesser names, and that works fine; they all suit their characters.  "Ratatouille" is a great film that young and old can enjoy together.</p></body></html>

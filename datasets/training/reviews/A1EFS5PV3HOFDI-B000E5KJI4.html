And am equally sorry to say that this movie did not live up to them. The only reason it is even remotely recieving four stars, is the fight scenes between Brad Pitt and Eric Bana. Also, Brad Pitt did his his role pretty well. Now for the complaints on this movie.<br /><br />First of all the movie seemed to forced. The dialogue was harsh and abrupt. Orlando Bloom doing better as a blonde arrow slinging elf than a hot sexy stud trying to win over Helen. Talking of Helen, I thought she was supposed to be the most beautiful woman in the world!!!!!!?<br /><br />Now to talk about Orlando Bloom, er... complain. Paris, contrary to the movie where he was son to King Priam ruler of Troy, Paris was supposed to be nothing more than a humble goat herder!!! Big difference people. He went to Troy to escape the wrath of Helen's husband. Again, big difference.<br /><br />Ok, this brings us now to the dialogue. Whats up with Brad Pitt insulting the King by calling him a "cask of wine?" When was that ever an insult? Not just that, but the writing of the dialogue was definetly too American, it left me feeling more like  I was watching a cheap shot at something being Mythological.<br /><br />The only good thing  about this movie was the scene where Wolfang Peterson showed the wide camera view of the army outside of Troy. Now that was impressive. But then he went and ruined it by stealing from Peter Jackson's  shot in his last LOTR movie where Viggo Mortenson and his small army are surrounded by Suron's. Just before Frodo throws the ring into the fire. Hmmm, back to Troy.<br /><br />Brad Pitt did a wonderful job, he at least deserved an academy award, being the sexy, brooding Achilles. But again, Wolfgang ruined it by killing him off in the end. He already twisted facts around, so why not just smudge over history and let poor Achilles run off with his lover?<br /><br />Last question. What ever happened to Cassandra? The crazed priestess who warned them not to bring in the trojan horse!<br /><br />That, and where did every body keep getting the wood if they where on a beach?</p></body></html>

Michael Douglas plays a devoted Secret agent who protects the president while secretly having an affair with the first lady. Then add to the spice he being framed while there's a plot to kill the president. While who called to lead the investigation but Michael Douglas protege played by Keifer Sutherland who is bitter and resentful towards Douglas character. Who part by the way I enjoyed. Then Eva Longoria who is Sutherland partner who more like the eye candy of the movie. But You will love the Sentinel because half the fun is trying to guess who the mole is.</p></body></html>

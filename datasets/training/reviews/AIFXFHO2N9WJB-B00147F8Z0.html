<meta name="summary" content="This War May Be Over Much Too Soon..."></head><body><p>After six individual films (four `Alien' films and two `Predator' films) showcased two of Hollywood's scariest monster movie icons, the Aliens and Predators, and then the initial pairing of the two species in 2003's "AVP: Alien Vs Predator", a concept that was years in the making after an Alien skull was spotted on the Predator's ship at the closing of "Predator 2", it appears that these enduring icons of sci-fi/horror films may have lost a step or two along the way. With all the success that these two franchises have enjoyed over the years since their introductions, it's a shame that such an ill-conceived sequel like the lackluster "Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem" (or AVP: R as it is often abbreviated), could possibly prove to be the final blow that puts both monsters down for the count.<br /><br />"Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem" picks up directly after the events of the original film, as we find a hybrid of a Predator and an Alien crash landing on Earth. Upon arrival the PredAlien quickly begins producing Alien offspring and once they are full grown, they begin to eliminate any humans they come into contact with. When the Predator ship that spawned the PredAlien fails to return to the Predator homeworld, one lone Predator comes to Earth to "clean up" the Alien infestation and destroy the hybrid at all costs.<br /><br />I have enjoyed all of the `Alien' and `Predator' movies (some more than others), and I thought that the initial pairing of the two monsters, "AVP: Alien Vs Predator", was a great way of linking the two franchises together, much the same way that the comic books had done many years before. So, when it was announced that another `Versus' movie was coming to theaters in 2007, I was instantly excited by the prospect to get to see these two beings fight it out once again. The first film was action packed and featured a decent amount of Alien and Predator fighting, but it seemed to focus more on the two species' attacking the humans caught in the crossfire. So, I was hoping that with this sequel there would be much more creature fighting creature instead of fighting humans, and I can honestly say that is the one thing this film got right. With "AVP: R" anyone that watched the first movie and was somewhat disappointed by the lack of creature fighting will definitely get their fill and then some. The fights are very fast and brutal; taking full advantage of the `R' rating it was given, so kudos for that aspect of the movie.<br /><br />Even though "AVP: R" included more creature versus creature fighting into the story, which was a major concern for the directors of this movie, The Brothers Strause (as they prefer to be called). Apparently, the thought never occurred to the directors or their writer, Shane Salerno (2000's "Shaft"), to include any semblance of an actual story that would hold any interest with the audience. The story for the first movie was solid, featured plenty of interesting characters, and provided numerous references to the two franchises, along with a nice beginning of a bridge between the two series'. With "AVP: R" the story that was started in the previous movie gets a very slight nudge forward near the end of the film, but for the most part the story pretty much just stands still. A decision which led me to believe that the creative minds behind this movie didn't really have any intention of extending the bridge that was started in "AVP", but merely wanted to cram as much fighting, gore, and incredibly lame characters and dialogue as they possibly could into a movie, leaving me incredibly disappointed in the process.<br /><br />The actors in "Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem" were adequate given what little they had to work with from such a paper-thin story. The main star of this ensemble cast comprised of B or even C-List actors was Steven Pasquale (TV's "Rescue Me"), who gave a fairly by-the-book portrayal as the token reformed tough guy with a good heart but always finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Next we have Reiko Aylesworth (TV's "24") as a mother just returning home from a tour of duty, and appears to be filling the role of an Ellen Ripley type of character. She does an adequate job of filling the role, and would have most likely been a much more intriguing character had the movie featured a more substantial story; instead, she's just another run-of-the-mill character that you can find in any bargain bin action movie. Rounding out the primary cast for "AVP:R" is John Ortiz ("Miami Vice") as the local sheriff who is in way over his head and is having to prove to himself and those around him that he deserves the job and the respect that comes with it. The rest of the supporting cast are a bunch of unknown, primarily teenage to early twenties, up-and-coming actors who are as forgettable as the rest of this dreadful movie.<br /><br />My last complaint for this movie is in regards to how it was filmed. I don't know who had the not-so bright idea to shroud the majority of this film in such extreme darkness, but someone should have spoken up to point out how stupid of an idea it was. The majority of this movie, and especially the numerous action sequences, are so incredibly dark or dimly lit that you can't see what's going on for the most part, and for this type of movie where the word "versus" is in the title, I think the action sequences are quite crucial and it should have been easier to see what was happening. However, you really can't see any details of the two creatures fighting to speak of, which caused me to begin losing interest in the movie's numerous fight scenes, and since "AVP: R" featured an abundance of fights I therefore quickly lost interest in the movie in general because the flimsy plot that was being used as the story sure wasn't going to keep my attention from waning. The biggest disappointment with how dark the film was is the fact that you hardly get to see the PredAlien hybrid, except for through the Predator's various vision settings, which only gave partial details of the creature's appearance. There were a couple of scenes that you could see more of the hybrid, and it looked cool from what I could tell, but when this new creature was essentially the driving force behind the movie, I just expected to see more of it, which was not the case at all and added even more to my frustration with the inferior nature of this sequel.<br /><br />"Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem" is an extremely weak attempt at a follow-up to the very entertaining "AVP: Alien Vs Predator" that first joined these two monstrous icons of Hollywood. For those that haven't noticed, the creative "geniuses" behind this movie were so lazy that aside from adding the subtitle "Requiem" to the title the only other change was adding the letter `s' to the end of `Alien'. At least by adding the subtitle the title became somewhat more interesting, prior to that addition the film was originally going to be called "Aliens Vs Predator", using only the `s' to note that it was a sequel and not a re-release of the original movie, how creative these directors', The Brothers Strause, have proven themselves to be. The story is surprisingly thin given that it was written by a decent writer with solid credentials, featuring stock characters that come off as fodder for the two creatures and not anyone to really care about; however, it does provide fans plenty of fighting between the two creatures although you'll be hard-pressed to really see any details in the scenes given how dark the color palette is for this movie. As a fan of both franchises separately, and of their initial versus match, I for one am hoping that this horrible excuse for a sequel will not be the end of what looked to have been a promising link between the two series'.<br /><br />"Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem" is available in rated R and unrated editions both contain violence and language.</p></body></html>

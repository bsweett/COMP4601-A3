<meta name="summary" content="Teen horror flick..."></head><body><p>This is a teen scream film about a group of teenagers saved from death due to the precognitive talents of one of their number, only to have Death call in his chips. To my surprise I actually kind of liked it. It has an interesting premise: what would happen if death itself wanted you dead? Overall I was amused. It's not rocket science but it was fun.<br /><br />Negatives: I could've done without the t&a scene at the tanning parlor, but I'm sure the men loved it. The DVD also has a feature which allows you to 'choose the fate' of the characters at certain points. I tried it, but was 'meh' about it. I thought there would be actual film footage- instead, there is sort of an epilog which tells you 'what happened next...' to the characters. After the first one I didn't bother to try the others.<br /><br />I particularly liked the ending. Three stars. Average, but gory horror fun.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Terrible"></head><body><p>This movie, along with part 2, is truly pathetic. One of my friends somehow convinced me to watch it, saying it was so much better than part 2, which I saw first. It is no better. It is just gore for the sake of gore. To people who say it has great storyline: no, it doesn't. The storyline is just an excuse to show innocent people be mindlessly tortured. I guess this film is loved by so many people because of all the sick freaks in this world, because seriously, who gets a kick out of this crap? Besides the sickos in today's society. I swear, mental therapists could make an entire living off of one Hostel fan. If you like this kind of thing, you are sick.</p></body></html>

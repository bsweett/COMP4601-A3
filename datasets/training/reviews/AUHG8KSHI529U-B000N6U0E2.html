<meta name="summary" content="One of my favorite movies of 2006"></head><body><p>I enjoyed this movie a great deal.  So did a great many others.  It took in more than $160 million in the U. S. and over $300 million worldwide.  Why?  Because everyone knows more about hard times than they care to admit.  We know what its like to be up against it financially, have a period in our lives when it is hard to pay the rent or make the mortgage payment.  While most of us haven't had to use a men's room as sleeping accommodations, we know what it is like to want to care for our children and have times when we can't provide for them as we would like. Most people know what it is like to have more meals of macaroni and cheese or ramen noodles than they would choose to have if they had more green in their wallets. Many more people know what a shutoff warning from the utility company looks like than would tell you about it.<br /><br />We know what it is like to have dreams and to pursue them under pressure and against tough odds.  We know what it is like to want to teach our kids about life and then later regret giving them our own disappointments rather than the truth and how that might sap their own dreams and vitality - the gifts of youth - and to want to take those words back.<br /><br />Almost all marriages have tough times.  Not every marriage collapses, but the pressures of life have killed marriages that could have made it under different circumstances.  We know what it is like to make a mistake in choosing a bad job and having to work our way out of it.<br /><br />For these reasons, and many more, we relate to this movie.  It is terrific.  And the performances by Will and Jaden Smith are something quite special.  Will Smith is always charismatic on the screen, but this time he wisely lets Jaden have that dramatic space and Will plays Chris Gardner, a real man under real pressure.  Chris is a brilliant man who didn't have the opportunities to develop his intellectual talents as he should have had.  He and his hard working wife made a tough business decision in trying to sell bone density scanners, but it was a product wasn't as accepted in the marketplace as they had hoped.  Now Linda (played with the right notes by Thandie Newton) has to work two shifts while their money gets spread thinner and thinner - to the point of evaporation.  A nice touch is when Linda pours the left over iced tea in their dinner glasses back into the pitcher.  Only people really hurting do that kind of thing.<br /><br />However, despite the hardship, this is a positive and heartwarming movie.  We root for everyone in the film.  We realize that a lot of the pain in the film is caused by mis-communication or a total lack of willingness or ability to simply go and explain the situation to another.  Maybe that was impossible and things would not have worked out as well if they had.  Still, we wish people would just say this or that to that person there.<br /><br />A terrific movie.  Enjoy it again.</p></body></html>

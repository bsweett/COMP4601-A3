<meta name="summary" content="Can emotions be taken away?"></head><body><p>Can you imagine having your emotions banned from society? Well, if you can't, then you'll have to watch Equilibrium to see for yourself. Here, we see a Fascist regime that has banned all forms of human emotions. Christian Bale is John Preston, a man of the highest rank for this notorious empire. At first, he sees human emotions as a plague upon humanity, but after he doesn't take his medicine due to an accident, he beings to experience emotions. Here, we get to see the good things in life, like music and color. But that's not the only thing that makes this film so recognizable.  We also have some tense action sequences. They may not be very realistic, but they're still so spectacular to look at. The cast is a great ensemble, though I did find Emily Watson to be a bit wooden at times (for a person who actually HAS emotion in this movie). Overall, I tried hard to love this movie, but I ended but only liking it. It is a very good film, but it's not one of my favorites (mostly due to the slow pace in the middle of the film, and some unnecessary choral music).</p></body></html>

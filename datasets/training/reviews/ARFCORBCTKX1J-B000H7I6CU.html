Pixar's success has been the result of paying more attention to the journey than the destination -- it's the unexpected ways the plots are worked out, and clever surprises along the way that make the telling of the story fresh (or at least seem fresh).<br /><br />"Cars" is the tale of Lightning McQueen, an arrogant, self-centered race car who has to learn that winning isn't everything, and that one's path through life is more important than the destination. We've seen all this before, but Lasseter & friends handle it with some degree of subtlety, with the story driven by character, not plot. (See my review of "Spirited Away", which is basically the same story, but developed very, very badly.) And there are some grin-inducing surprises, such as the cow-tipping sequence. The ending is also pleasing -- Lightning decides that winning the big race is not the most-important thing, and is amply rewarded in other ways.<br /><br />"Cars" is a good film, but not quite up to the standards of most of the preceding Pixars. Why, I can't say. All the parts are present, but the pistons just don't seem to be firing at full power. Perhaps not enough time is spent with the secondary characters. I intend to watch "Cars" again, but mostly to catch all the little details, gags, and asides I missed the first time. Unlike the "Toy Story"s, "A Bug's Life", or "The Incredibles", it's not a film I'm likely to watch because I feel like some mood-lifting fun. It's all a bit too mechanical. (Your mileage may vary.)<br /><br />The extras are of the generally high quality one expects from Pixar. The "making of" is, if anything, too short -- one would like to know more about the people Lasseter met along Route 66. "Mater and the Ghostlight" is amusing but ultimately pointless (it was apparently a deleted sequence -- Mater suggests that he and Lightning stay up to look for the ghostlight, but they don't -- and was animated as a DVD bonus), while "One-Man Band" is witty and a beautiful piece of CGI animation. (No one has yet matched Pixar, aesthetically or technically.)<br /><br />I'm surprised Disney's 1951 cartoon "Susie, the Little Blue Coupe", an obvious influence, isn't included. Regardless of how one might feel about the typically cute/sentimental story, it's a pleasure to watch a cartoon short subject made with as much attention to detail and quality as a feature film.<br /><br />PS: Disney HD showed "Cars" last night, and I watched because I had nothing better to do that I felt like doing. My feelings haven't changed. "Cars" lacks the surprises and twists of most other Pixar films, chugging its way to a predetermined finish. It just isn't much fun.</p></body></html>

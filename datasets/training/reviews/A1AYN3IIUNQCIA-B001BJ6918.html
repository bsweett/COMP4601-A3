<meta name="summary" content="tarintinos best work"></head><body><p>when i saw it in theators i thought i was going to see a sloppy part two but i was wrong. this part of the movie is so much better then vol 1, i mean it shows more dialague, smart humor, and a good handfull of action. this is really tarintinos holywood worthy oscar winning film that will give him a well deserved credit. the first was a japaneas type movie but this is like a weastern type of film. i saw its a smart swicth. after being gunned down at her wedding, killing evry one in it. the bride wakes up and goes after the poeple who killed her. already crossing of two people on her death list, the bride heads west for her final victoms. bills younger brother budd and her one eyed counter part elle and of course bill. the other reason that this film is so good is that it answers some questions from the first film that brings the entire story together. it shows how the bride becomes so deadly (under the teachings of pei mai) who is one funny old dude. why the bride quit. how elle lost her one eye. why bill shot her down at her wedding. it also shows use the cliffhanger left on vol 1. to make it say it the best it is just one great oscar winning, popcorn munching, instant classic, sewing back together movie that just gives you the main slice of the turkey. just see what is one truly great movie</p></body></html>

Much like filmmakers David Lynch, Terry Gilliam, and Vincent Ward, Darren Aronofsky explores the realm of dark drama, where dreams and fantasies flow into everyday reality. His film The Fountain is an ambitious science fiction/fantasy film with a strong metaphysical undercurrent. As always, Aronofsky utilizes his keen visual sense of storytelling while focusing on characterization and maintaining an emotional momentum. What really brings the film together is the unique narrative structure that combines three different timeframes. This storytelling device can partly be accredited to Aronofsky, though most of the praise should go to the film's under appreciated editor, Jay Rabinowitz.<br />Another crucial element of the film is the haunting music by Clint Mantell, which will stay with the viewer long after the film is over.<br />The film stars Hugh Jackman as Tomas Seville / Tom Creo and Rachel Weisz as Queen Isabel / Izzi Creo. The talented supporting cast features Ellen Burstyn, Mark Margolis, Stephen McHattie, and Cliff Curtis. Still, there's no doubt that it's the performances of Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz that propel the story forward.<br /><br />In the year 1,500 A.D. Queen Isabel of Spain suffers under the reign of terror that was the Grand Inquisition. She turns to her most valiant warrior, Tomas Seville, to save Spain from bondage and in return she will give him her hand in marriage. The queen believes that the Tree of Life grows in New Spain (or South America), and that whoever drinks the sap from this tree shall be given immortality. This, she believes, is her only hope of saving herself and her country from the wrath of the sanctimonious grand inquisitor, Silecio. So Tomas gathers together the bravest of the conquistadors and travels to New Spain in search of the fabled Tree of Life... but the dangers that await him may prove too great even for this noble warrior who faithfully serves his queen.<br />In the year 2,000 A.D. a doctor named Tom Creo searches for a way to save his dying wife Izzi, who has an inoperable brain tumor. But as Izzi's health declines she finds a spiritual awakening in the legends of the ancient Mayan culture. These legends revive memories of a past life and inspire Izzi to write a novel that will help Tom cope with her inevitable death. All the while, Tom is consumed with grief and obsessively continues his research with an enzyme found in a rare South American tree.<br />In the year 2,500 A.D. Tom travels through space with the tree he planted over Izzi's grave. Haunted by images from their past, he meditates on loss and what it means to live and die. As Tom drifts ever closer to Xibalba, a dying star that is enshrouded in a nebula, he learns the truth about immortality. Most importantly Tom learns to let go and understand the importance of physical death.<br /><br />In the end (if there really can be one), The Fountain is about a love shared between two soul mates, a love that transcends life and death, time and space.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W46I">Somewhere in Time</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G8NXZK">Brazil</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007PALZ2">12 Monkeys</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007GZR5">What Dreams May Come</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GAOBI">Donnie Darko</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKJA">Mulholland Drive</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002Y4TWE">Riverworld</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LC55F2">The Prestige</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPA6">Pan's Labyrinth</a></p></body></html>

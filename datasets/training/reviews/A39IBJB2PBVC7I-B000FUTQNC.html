<meta name="summary" content="Firefly"></head><body><p>Mark Twain once said that the difference between the right word and the word that's almost right is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug.  Firewall, starring Harrison Ford, and the still exquisite Virginia Madsen, is a firefly.  It has all the elements of a taut thriller, highly pressurized situations, loathsome baddy, sympathetic good guys, excellent production value, acting, and cinematography. The only thing missing is the thrill.<br /><br />This is such familiar country for Harrison Ford that one wonders if he even needs to look at the scripts anymore.  He's in a jam, his family is in danger, and he must single-handedly battle insane odds and triumph.  Most familiar of all is his pained look, reflecting deep interior anguish.  We are so accustomed to seeing Harrison Ford looking haunted, stoically suffering in silence, that we must wonder if he gets a royalty every time somebody else looks like this.  His acting is fine, indeed the acting is fine throughout, but there's nothing unfamiliar or unexpected happening.<br /><br />Alan Arkin and Robert Forster - both excellent actors - aren't on-screen long enough to help the cause.  The plot offers no "aha" twists, which are a staple of films like this.  Worst of all, the evil mastermind - always the fulcrum of a thriller - played by Paul Bettany, gets less interesting and convincing as the film advances.  He begins well, a dispassionate, cerebral Brit that has done his homework very carefully.  But instead of controlled, implied violence - far more powerful in a thriller - he vents his anger impulsively, ironically at his own henchmen.  (Poor leadership skills.)  In the plus column, how he meets his well-deserved fate is totally satisfying.<br /><br />"High-tech" computer world drama is hard to present on screen; that said, the film fails on this level as well.  It is actually quite low-tech.  The movie "Inside Man," starring Clive Owen, is flawed, but at least it's a bank robbery movie fueled by a very interesting, unexpected idea.  The same could not be said of Firewall.</p></body></html>

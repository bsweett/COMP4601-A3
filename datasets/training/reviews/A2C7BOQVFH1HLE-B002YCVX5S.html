<meta name="summary" content="Tarantino's Best Film Since "Pulp Fiction" Looks Excellent On Blu!"></head><body><p>Just when I feared that Tarantino may be heading towards the same fate as M. Night S i.e. one brilliant film followed by several average ones we get what has to be his next best work since the masterpiece of "Pulp Fiction".  This bluray version is also excellent coming in reference disc quality with impeccable picture and wonderful DTS-HD MA 5.1 sound quality as well.  The extra disc containing the digital copy is useless to me and although the special feature documentaries aren't anything really to shout about, the quality of the main disc alone makes this a worthy addition to your blu-ray video library.  Historical and yet far from being historically accurate, this film is very enjoyable and while not quite in the same league as "Pulp Fiction" this film still ranks highly among the more recent studio releases.<br /><br />Great Tarantino script, excellent reference quality picture and sound makes this blu ray a highly recommended addition to your video library.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Even if you hate Christmas films you will like this one"></head><body><p>I would generally rather have my teeth pulled than sit through the generally loathsome Christmas movie fare that is available these days.  Only a few movies are exceptions to this, and "A Christmas Story" is near the top of that list.<br /><br />It doesn't matter that the story is set in late 1945 --- if you remember your own childhood (or have kids in the right age) you will be able to relate to the trials & tribulations of Ralphie and his peers.  This movie is remarkably free of sappy nostalgia --- thank fortune --- and instead focuses on the ordeals of childhood with all of Shepard's mordant wit wonderfully intact.  The narrative & dialogue is exquisite and always has me laughing, even after repeated viewings.<br /><br />From a historical perspective, I enjoy the fact that this is one of very very few films available today that deals with post-war 1940's USA.  I cannot think of many films ("Best Years of Our Lives" --- any others?) that cover that particular time period, which seems to have disappeared from our collective memory for some reason.<br /><br />Really, this is as good as it gets; a reminiscence of childhood without sentiment or nostalgia, and gobs of humor.  It happens to be centered around the Christmas season, so I suppose it has to be classified as a Christmas film, but it really is entertaining to watch at any time of the year.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Stallone matures, broods, blows heads up and gets the job done"></head><body><p>To anyone laughing at a 61-year old Stallone's decision to star as John Rambo in a fourth film, Stallone himself says 'Take that'.  Rambo (just plain Rambo), not only completely gets the job done as an ultraviolent action movie, but it even has a thought or two on the world, and an eye on a real-life hellhole (Burma).<br /><br />Re-visiting the character who came to define 80s Reagan macho guy with guns, Stallone does not opine on the state of the world, or even philosophize on mankind.  Instead, Rambo is a man of very few words, a quiet, wounded shell living in the jungles of southeast Asia, catching poisonous snakes for a living, and basically being tortured by his past and his true nature.  When the action across the border invites a group of well-wishing missionaries, Rambo reluctantly agrees to shephard them along the river so they can deliver medicine to the terrorized Burmese peasants.  When missionaries get kidnapped by the insano Burmese military, led locally by a nameless guy with evil mirrored shades, Rambo escorts a group of mercenaries up the river on a privately funded rescue mission.<br /><br />What follows is nothing short of an orgy of violence, outdoing all of the previous Rambo films in its intensity and graphic nature.  Heads explode, fly off, arrows penetrate skulls, people get blown up by grenades, people get shot to pieces (literally), body parts are yanked out or off with bare hands, and when the smokes clears, yes, Rambo is still standing.  Game over.<br /><br />If one doubts that Stallone honestly did have something sincere to bring to the table, consider that he did film this in Burma, right before the top blew off and the real slaughter began.  Consider that he's that obsessed, that he'll depict the Burmese generals as the worst people on earth, then outdo even them as he blows heads up in the brain-soaked finale.<br /><br />Highly recommended for genre fans, Stallone is a quiet, brooding death machine with little hype and less to say.  This film deals violence and oppression in the world, the use of violence, and the perservering nature of the best and worst of mankind, and also the perservering nature of Stallone himself.  The world is a cold, ugly, violent place that clearly has many uses for violent men, but it also stages their necessity for the preservation of hope and good amidst machine-gunned torsos and decapitated noggins.<br /><br />And a note on the DVD itself: excellent job.  Of special note are the missing/deleted scenes, since none of them are missed at all.  The decision to scrap the sappy, extended, philosophical exchanges between Rambo and the main female character (who somehow is able to get through and convince him to help out) are totally unnecessary and would have (unacceptably) delayed the ultraviolence that all paid to see.  This is a trim, efficient film, and even though he claims that there is no 'Director's Cut' (since this is it), I wouldn't be surprised if someone decides to mess with a good thing and does, in fact, release a 'Director's Special Directorial Producer's Cut'.  Till then, this will do.</p></body></html>

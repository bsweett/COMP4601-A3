With its intense visual style, gracefully choreographed fight scenes and a storyline that you are really able to get into, Hero proves to be the only movie I've seen recently that is really worth a damn. I've heard people say it's the Chinese 'Braveheart' and I really think that sums this picture up. This definitely feels like epic filmmaking. I would absolutely recommend this one to not only people that are fans of martial arts movies, but also to people who are enraptured by awesome storytelling. Plus the visual style in this film is just phenomenal.</p></body></html>

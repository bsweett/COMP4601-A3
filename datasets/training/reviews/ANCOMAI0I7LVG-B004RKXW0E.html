<meta name="summary" content="The best for last!!!"></head><body><p>So, I probably know this movie better than the people there at Pixar (the curse of having a `Toy Story' obsessed 3-Year-Old) and I still think it's one of the best films of the year, easy (the BEST next to `The Social Network').  Why?  Well, for one it is beautifully constructed to excite and entertain.  It is a lovable piece of animated heaven.  On top of the obvious though, there is warmth presented within the films surprisingly deep themes that make this stand out as heartfelt and honest.  When you watch this beautiful movie you cannot help but become a part of the story.<br /><br />It's hard to come off of the success of films as wildly lauded as the first two installments in the pitch perfect trilogy, but somehow the folks there at Pixar made good on their promise and saved the best for last.<br /><br />Seriously, it's THAT good.<br /><br />The film follows the adventures of your favorite toys, Woody the Cowboy, Buzz Lightyear, Jessie the Cowgirl, Bullseye, Slinky-Dog, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Rex and the rest of their friends (which has been dwindled down to a select few over the years.  Years have passed since we last saw them and Andy, their owner, is now full grown and on his way to college.  The toys are devastated at the prospect of being thrown away, never to be played with again.  When an unfortunate accident lands the toys on the curb they take immediate action and donate themselves to Sunnyside Daycare, a seemingly magical place where toys can enjoy love and affection from kids forever and ever.<br /><br />Nothing is as it seems though.<br /><br />Yes, this film is funny, but it doesn't end there.  This film is also devastatingly sincere.  While no one watching this film is a `toy' the feelings and emotions presented by the toys themselves is so earnest and believable that one cannot help but find a piece of themselves within these lost souls.  The foreknowledge that you have been outgrown is a powerful message about growing up and moving on, about losing the ones we love whether it is by our own hands or by events out of our control.  Relationships in general are outgrown, and this film tackles that understanding with a depth not often attributed to animated films (I love Pixar for making SMART animated films).  What is even more powerful is the loss of innocence that is broached in the final frames, with Andy and his toys and their eventuality.  It is a beautiful and moving statement about leaving childish things behind but never forgetting the beauty that abounds within them.<br /><br />Yes, I was bawling at the end of this film.<br /><br />I will throw a mild disclaimer out there in regards to your kids and this movie.  The film is a tad scarier than the other two in the trilogy.  In fact, my daughter was petrified of Lotso-Huggin'-Bear the first time she saw this film.  He is VERY mean hearted and the way that the film is shot and his sequences done (with dramatic lighting and music) can be overwhelming for some children (there were multiple screams in the theaters).  That said, when all was said and done my daughter loved the film and actually saw it three times in the theater and we have it on pre-order, so you be the judge.  I just thought I should put that out there.<br /><br />In the end, this was one of the more rewarding experiences I had in the theater this year, maybe even this decade.  It was everything I wanted it to be and more; much, much more!</p></body></html>

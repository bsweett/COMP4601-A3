<meta name="summary" content="i hate myself for enjoying this movie this much"></head><body><p>yep, its obvious 20 minutes into the movie what the denouement will be, but i found this so skillfully done i give it a top rating. just wildly fun to watch as a heist movie, a genre i always tend to enjoy. the entire cast, led of course by kevin spacey, seems to have enjoyed itself. a guilty pleasure.</p></body></html>

These ramshackle tin roof warrens are home to hundreds of thousands of people, each with their own stories, tragedies, and triumphs.  Like "City of God," which ripped aside the veil to show the horrific slums just outside of the paradise of Rio, "Slumdog" shows the squalor that can be found side-by-side with such romantic icons as the Taj Mahal.<br /><br />I saw "Slumdog" after all the awards and accolades, and I was worried.  Could it possibly live up to the hype?  I knew that one of the characters, Jamal (played in teen version by Dev Patel, in youth by other actors) would end up on the Indian version of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," and that he had the hots for a gorgeous gal, Latika (teen version, Freida Pinto).  Would this movie strike me as flat as "Juno," another movie I didn't see until dozens of people had told me that "you have to see this" (turns out, no I didn't).  Or would this be like "Sideways," a movie that charmed me out of my socks even though everyone seemingly had raved about it?<br /><br />The great news is that "Slumdog" is another "Sideways" in that regard.<br /><br />Using the structure of the increasing dollar amounts of "Millionaire," "Slumdog" tells the story of three kids as they try to make their way in a harsh, bleak world that chews up and spits out kids like so many cherry pits.  No spoilers here - just prepare to be shocked at the horrors these kids face with so much aplomb as well as the snatches of beauty and humanity these kids find along the way.  Not as harsh as "City of God" by any means, "Slumdog" nevertheless contains more than its share of powerful scenes that will haunt you.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's a Wonderful Film!  Too Bad the DVD's Not So Wonderful!"></head><body><p>Although it didn't impress much at the time of it's release, this film probably more than most others, goes to show that eventually the cream always rises to the top.  It's just a charming, heart-warming film with a nice mix of comedy, drama, sadness, despair and joy which makes it difficult for any human being to not be touched emotionally in some way by this film.  The screenplay is very good, the casting excellent and James Stewart shows why he is considered to be among the greatest screen actors of all time.<br /><br />The DVD though isn't all that much to shout about.  The Special Features are pretty decent with a very good documentary about the film hosted by Tom Bosley of "Happy Days" fame being the standout but it's placed on the the "B" side of this single disc.  Fortunately with the advent of Blu-ray and the much greater capacity such a format affords, we don't have to put up with this inconvenience any longer.  The sound quality is in the original mono format which has been THX mastered which makes it the best possible mono quality that you can find.  However, it would have been nice if they were to provided Dolby or otherwise 5.1 Surround Sound Options as well.  The picture quality has been restored but not very well as visual imperfections exist throughout the film suggesting either a poorly preserved master or that the restoration job wasn't the best.<br /><br />I note at the time of writing that a Blu-Ray version is out there and I wonder if they made any more audio and visual restorations and if so, I will certainly put it on my list of Blu-Ray titles to get in the future.  If you are not too picky about the "dirtiness" of the picture quality, this DVD is certainly one for your collection that bears the test of repeated viewing and enjoyment.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

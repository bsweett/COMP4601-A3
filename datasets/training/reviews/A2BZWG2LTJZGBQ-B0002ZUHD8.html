I know how historically inaccurate this attempt was, and if you have read any of the reviews here, so do you.  What makes this so mediocre is the fact that no one in the cast distinguishes themselves until well into the film.  I got Arthur and Lancelot confused the first few times I saw them.  Neither of the main actors for Arthur and Lancelot are household names.  Sometimes this tactic of using unknown actors works and feels fresh, like the young kids who were so great in That Thing You Do!, Tom Hanks' directorial debut.  Here, however, it would have been a good decision to have a bigger name than Keira Knightley as the main star.  The story is okay, but nothing you haven't seen before.  The battle scenes are well done, but pretty much all war movies these days have great effects.  This is the age of great computer effects.  So the war scenes won't blow anyone away.  In short, this is a moderately entertaining two hours plus that had it never been made, would never have been missed.</p></body></html>

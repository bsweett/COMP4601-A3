<meta name="summary" content="A "Father" to a Group of Boys on an Arduous Cattle Drive"></head><body><p>All the men have gone after the gold, and the rancher, Wil Anderson (John Wayne), is desperate for cowhands. The boys selected are first required to prove their skills. Gradually, they do. Indeed, if you like horsemanship, this movie is for you! There are numerous scenes of skillful horse riding, lassoing of cattle, branding of cattle, breaking-in of recalcitrant horses, the crossing of treacherous rivers on horseback, and much more. Much of this occurs on the cattle drive, where the toughness of the boys is pushed to the limit.<br /><br />There are some boyish episodes shown. The boys scare girls in their classroom with frogs. They have their fistfights. They talk about unclad females.  During the cattle drive, they steal some hard liquor from the adults just to see what it is like to get drunk. They find out!<br /><br />Some viewers may feel uncomfortable about the fact that the African-American cook is habitually called the N-word in this movie. But that is a concession to the usage at the time.<br /><br />The cattle drive turns deadly. A bunch of rustlers are out to steal the cattle.  Wil Anderson is ambushed. What will the boys do? Will they revert to childhood helplessness, or will they behave like men and take charge?</p></body></html>

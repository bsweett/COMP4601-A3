<meta name="summary" content="It'll Give You The Crave"></head><body><p>Since before the written word, some of the most powerful, lasting stories have been tales of long and perilous journeys.  Odysseus <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140268863">The Odyssey</a> fought monsters and suitors alike, just trying to get home.  A group of Englishmen and women, seeking the grave of a Holy Martyr that helped them when they were sick, take a pilgrimage to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140424385">Canterbury</a>.  A young hobbit bites off more than he can chew when he takes the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618517650">One Ring</a> to Mount Doom.  And now... Harold and Kumar go to white castle.<br /><br />Okay, now that I got the dramatic intro out of my system, here goes the review.  "Harold and Kumar" is very much THAT movie that you can watch with your friends over and over.  There are a bunch of laughs, a fairly simple yet effective story, and constant "I can't believe they took it so far" moments.  This is one of those movies where it's pretty much exactly what you expect it to be.  The higher you are when you watch it, the higher your enjoyment will be.  It's light enough to be rewatchable.  And, most obviously, it'll give you The Crave.<br /><br />So it is what it is.  It's a funny movie that requires zero audience involvement and offers a lot of laughs.  Although the silly moments are a bit too silly and the sweet moments are a bit too sweet, there are a lot of good bits that make this a movie that's probably worth owning on DVD.  If you're looking for something to watch with your friends on a lazy night, this is a good choice.<br /><br />7/10</p></body></html>

An idyllic Mid-west small town seems just like any other idyllic Mid-west small town until the town drunk stalks into the middle of a youth league baseball game with his shotgun.  David (Tim Olyphant, "Deadwood," "Justified"), the town lawman, tries his best but when you're confronted with a shotgun toting drunk, odds are you're going to need to use your gun.<br /><br />This tragedy might go unnoticed as a once-in-a-generation tall tale that you so often hear of small towns ("Remember the time when the cops gunned down that guy at the ballgame?") if it weren't for the fact that across town a farmer burns his family home to the ground after locking his wife and son inside.<br /><br />Something is wrong in Pleasantville.<br /><br />Eventually David and his wife Judy (Radha Mitchell, "Man on Fire"), who just happens to be the town doctor, begin the fight to save their town, only to have that fight circumvented by the arrival of The Government.  Unfortunately for David, Judy, and their neighbors, The Government appears much more interested in making this problem go away - by any means necessary - than with saving the town.  As far as The Government is concerned, the only thing worse than destroying a small American town with a Government-engineered biological weapon is to have the story break on the national news.<br /><br />David, Judy, and their friends must not only survive the Crazies - who are only too happy to kill you in the most violent manner possible - they must avoid falling into the helpful, welcoming arms of Big Brother.  This poses an interesting question - where do you turn for help when the people who are in charge of helping you want you to disappear?<br /><br />Olyphant has become one of our most reliable actors.  With a glare or a quick one-liner, Olyphant conveys a depth of character - and often menace - that draws you in.  When David makes an unimaginable offer to Judy, you believe him, just because Olyphant is that good.<br /><br />"The Crazies" is a violent movie, although not nearly as bloody as the plethora of other zombie films we've seen in recent years.  Tension rather than terror rules the day here, and that's a good thing.</p></body></html>

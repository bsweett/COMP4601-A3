<meta name="summary" content="Shymalan's Second Chances are Running Out"></head><body><p>The Happening is an indefensible unintentional laugh-fest.  I'm not a fan of M. Night Shyamalan.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BRZ5J2">The Sixth Sense</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00121QGV8">Unbreakable</a> are very good movies but after that his films are hugely flawed and contain only brief moments of effective suspense.  Shyamalan really had a unique knack for directing fear in his actors at his most inspired moments, and in addition to that the writing of his first two films was also a plus.  He was a very good filmmaker for a spell.  The Happening is so much more tragic than some people have warned, but here at Amazon it seems I finally find myself agreeing with many other reviewers who I'd normally suggest are exaggerating.  One says "so bad it's shocking" and another calls the film "the crappening".  Both are spot on.<br /><br />Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) is a high school science teacher whose marriage to his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) is seemingly in some jeopardy.  His friend Julian (John Leguizamo) is aware that Alma may have been unfaithful.  Along with Julian's daughter, this group searches for safety in a world that has just been hit by a massive suicide epidemic that is never convincingly explained and never turns out to be an engaging occurrence to begin with.  I actually like all three actors in some roles but they are either left with so little direction that they don't know what to do or how to react to Shyamalan's apocalypse, or they are smiling behind thin performances because they realize they are in a bombastic failure of a film.  I lean toward the latter because by the film's conclusion Deschanel and Wahlberg really seem like they are in a comedy.<br /><br />The Happening is bad because it wants to be taken so seriously.  It has moments that should be horrifying but instead elicited several moments of laughter from this viewer.  For those who have seen the film I will just say that the scene that really sticks out for me involves a suicide at the zoo.  There are also moments of incredibly unlikely behavior; to the point where I slapped my own forehead.  I mean come on, if a lady is talking to her daughter who is vulnerable to this unknown suicide causing agent, I hardly think she would put the girl on speaker so a dozen other people can hear her die.  It's a shame because The Happening should've been good.  On the surface it is a decent story with a good cast.  Not to mention all of the pieces theoretically enhance Shyamalan's talents.  I was hoping this would take films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JU7KAE">Lady in the Water</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00064LJVE">The Village</a> and promptly decrease their significance in the mainstream eye, but instead The Happening only serves to support Shyamalan's very obvious decline.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Classic!"></head><body><p>Although Terminator 2 is definitely the best Terminator film, as many people would agree, Terminator was still a classic, defining sci-fi film that deserves worthy credit without a shadow of a doubt.  The original Terminator helped in definining the sci-fi action movie industry and is, in my opinion and many other people's opinion, one of the all time best sci-fi movies of all time.  I had previously already upgraded Terminator 2 to Blu-Ray, but I figured it was time to also do the same with the original Terminator, because it's no less deserving of that in my opinion.  Just like Alien 1 & 2, so is Terminator 1 and 2 as far as classic awesomeness.  I recently encountered this addition of Terminator on Blu-Ray and decided that I simply had to have this edition of it, and now I do.  Many of the younger generation of nerds/geeks out there I've ever talked to are not familiar with these films, and I made sure to let them know that they needed to look into them.  Sure, they're a bit older and the special effects are decidedly not the most amazing, but they're still awesome films that every sci-fi & action lover should watch, so if you're reading this and you have never seen the Terminator films, or even the Alien films for that matter, get on it!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better than &quot;schindlers list&quot;"></head><body><p>I did not like &quot;Schindlers List&quot;. That movie was too Hollywood driven. &quot;The Pianist&quot;, on the other hand was detailed, richly engaging and incredibly sad.<br />Adrien Brodie was the perfect choice as a Holocaust survivor in this true story of the horrific nature of WW2. Only Roman Polanski could make such a film. Over 3 hours in duration, but you will not notice because the film is so engaging, if not difficult to watch at times.<p>The DVD itself is a must-own, along with &quot;Sophie's Choice&quot;.</p></body></html>

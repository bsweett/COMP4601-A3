<meta name="summary" content="One hell of an upscale picture"></head><body><p>It's Working Girl all over again with an overbearing boss this time in the world of fashion design. Anne Hathaway is sufficient in role of aspiring writer who is convinced being a secretary in a high scale fashion magazine will open many doors.<br />The nemeses is her cranky and inner boiling high tempered boss played by Meryl Streep.<br />Anne gives a suitable portrayal as clunky type freshman to a world of high design, but picks up tips with a fellow coworker who has been in the business, and even gets hit on by another high profile celebrity in the business, thus leaving her decision to relish in her new upscale life while ignoring her real friends, and boyfriend.<br />The challenge of being a number one secretary to one of the most notorious fashion model magazines with hardcore nails in the journalistic business almost makes her go for it, until Miranda, the boss, confides an observation of similarity. It is this revelation which makes the successful secretary drop everything, when accused of doing or walking over anybody to simply get ahead. Well made moral, and makes you wonder who the real lucky ones are in the scheme of things. The Miranda's, or the typical everyman.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a masterpiece!!"></head><body><p>like most of the films I see there are some that grab my attention and this is one of them. it's number 3 on my top 10 list. Se7en is a well made thriller with gut churning twists and turns that catapoltes you into the mind blowing end. Freeman is superb and Pitt's performance is key here with his character wanting to take this killer down. Paltrow is also good as Pitt's wife. the end with her head in the box is really a stomach twister. and who better to fit the shoes of the killer then the ever so talented Kevin Spacey who delivers again another brillant but short performance. the killings are gruesome and the knots in your stomach will stay. David Fincher creates a masterwork</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jennifer Hudson deserved that Oscar!!!"></head><body><p>I finally watched "Dreamgirls" last weekend.  Mostly I wanted to see it because it had won an Oscar, or should I say Jennifer Hudson won the Oscar for Supporting Actress. What a performance!  To think she came from American Idol(and not the winner) and is such an amazing performer and actress.  The movie seemed like the perfect vehicle for her rev up her movie career.<br />"Dreamgirls" reminded me a bit of the story of The Supremes.  It is the 50's when it starts.  Three back up singers for Eddie Murphy's Jimmy "Thunder" Early, dance and sing their way up to the front of the stage.  Eventually they have their own girl group, The Dreams.  Curtis Taylor, Jr. played by Jamie Foxx, is the manager of the group.<br />Beyonce Knowles plays the main singer, Deena Jones, who gets all the attention that I felt Effie White, Jennifer Hudson's character, deserved.  I felt she got the shaft because she wasn't the imagine that they wanted for the group.  She was the most talented.  She knows it too, and eventually takes a bad turn away from the group.<br />"Dreamgirls" was a musical/play before it was a film and it transitioned well to onto the big screen.  It had some great songs and was set from the 50's to the 60's.  It's worth watching just to see Jennifer Hudson perform her Oscar winning performance.</p></body></html>

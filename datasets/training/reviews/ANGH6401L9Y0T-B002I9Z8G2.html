<meta name="summary" content="Patrick Stewart is Brilliant Once Again"></head><body><p>OK, at least one of those five stars is just for Patrick Stewart, for whom I have considerable lust. I understand this is the second of the Next Gen series. I really must get the rest.<br /><br />As hard-core fans know, Zefram Cochrane made his historical first warp flight on April 5, 2063.  Anyway, it turns out that the Borg took a time warp back to the day before in order to destroy Cochrane and his ship, thereby preventing first contact and making the population of earth easy to assimilate. Since this would destroy the time line on which the Enterprise exists, it has to be stopped.<br /><br />So the Enterprise goes back in time (the method is a clever one; I won't reveal it), following the Borg to try to stop them and protect Cochrane and his warp ship. Try? Why do I say try? Captain Picard does not merely try things; he succeeds. How he succeeds is one very good adventure story. Complicated, as all time travel stories are, but it is possible to follow it.<br /><br />Zefram Cochrane is a fascinating character; he even manages to get Deanna Troi drunk! The Borg Queen shows up, trying to seduce Data and then the Captain. Data even gets some real skin! But of course our intrepid heroes win in the end; otherwise they wouldn't exist in the 24th century, and we know they do</p></body></html>

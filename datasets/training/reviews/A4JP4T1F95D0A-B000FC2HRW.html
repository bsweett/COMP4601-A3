This time, it is all the people who got off a roller coaster that crashed shortly after.  The story moves nicely, and most of the characters are interesting.  The deaths are certainly unique and pretty gorey.  This dvd is full of extras, including choosing an alternate path for characters to take which may lead them to safety.  The extras alone make this a worthy buy.  I will probably wait until the inevitable 3 movie box comes out and grab them all.</p></body></html>

Enjoyable on a range of levels, the movie is one of the most memorable I have seen. Brilliantly shot and acted, this is one of the greats, in my opinion.<br /><br />Michael Sullivan (Hanks) is an enforcer for an Irish mafia boss, (Newman), with a simple ethic in life. He also has an abiding fear that his sons will grow up just like him and follow him into the business. Soon enough, however, the internal politics of the Rooney family overtake the Sullivans as Connor Rooney (Craig) makes a move and ends up wiping out Sullivan's family. Michael Sullivan Jr and Michael Sullivan Sr take to the road and try to level things out. Throw in a profession assassin with a proclivity to maccabre art (Law) and you have a complex plot that keeps one in the zone.<br /><br />As mentioned, the cinematography is excellent, with some amazing scenes that are truly artistic. The filming was excellent, and matched by the great acting from Newman, Hanks, Law and many others. Portraying hard men in a hard lifestyle is something they all did very well.<br /><br />Overall, this film is without doubt a very memorable one and one that is worth sitting through a number of times. Something new will be gleaned from each viewing, adding to one's appreciation. I loved it and still watch it when I have the chance. Recommended, for sure!</p></body></html>

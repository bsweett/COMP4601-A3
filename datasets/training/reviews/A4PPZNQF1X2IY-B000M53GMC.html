The movie started out pretty well, with modest intrigue and pacing as it presented the Bond gadgets and women.  However, the second half really drags and is just one non-sequiter after another.  I mean, there's supposed to be a litte suspense and cleverness, right? Of course, the movie is not about plot, but after awhile the bone head script is really annoying.  Also, the movie feels dated, the action is slow and cheesy, and it's shot in a very clunky and dull style. Just like the duck on Sean's head in the opening sequence, this one is for the birds!</p></body></html>

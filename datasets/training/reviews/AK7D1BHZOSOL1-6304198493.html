You never know where the action is going to turn and there is never a dull moment.  The action is told from the point of view of the sole survivor of gang.  He and the story he reveals will have you guessing about the ending and your answer will always be wrong.  The movie is fun but scary in a freaky kind of way at the same time Great performances all around, this kinda reminds me of "The Long Kiss Goodnight" <p>Overall-If you are looking for a good movie get this</p></body></html>

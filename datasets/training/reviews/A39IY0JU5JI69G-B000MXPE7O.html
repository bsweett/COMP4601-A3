A little more objectivity and a much better film might have emerged.<br /><br />The spy game and its corroding effects on the human psyche are much better told by LeCarre.  Still it's a good theme and worth exploring.  There's just too much crammed in here and as much as I cared to follow the intricacies of the plot after while I lost interest.  I think DeNiro had to chose which of the two plots to focus on - the spy plot or the human drama; he tried for too much and as a result people just get tired of watching and lose interest.<br /><br />The cast is stellar and they all do heroic jobs.  I usually love Matt Damon and I don't fault him for the less-than-fascinating performance.  He was undoubtably told to play "cold" and "emotionally detached" and he gave us that for two hours and forty some minutes.  I think that the development, or devolution of his character would have been much more interesting if we had seen more of the younger, livelier man, who gradually hardened into stone.  The most interesting parts of the film were his brief love scenes with the two hearing impaired women.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie did a wonderful job but I think she was miscast.  She was far too exotically beautiful to play a girl whom Damon would so easily ignore.<br /><br />As other reviewers here have mentioned, there are certainly some cliches indulged in...There's no guessing what DeNiro thinks about WASP culture...gee, are they all as bad as that?!!<br /><br />The film isn't awful, as Hollywood films go, but I suggest that anyone really interested in the genre to skip this and re-watch the LeCarre films.</p></body></html>

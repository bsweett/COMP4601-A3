Rich shipyard owner, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), presses the retiree to undertake a detective job following his wife Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) who Gavin believes may be under some kind of supernatural possession and who seems to be a reincarnated version of her grandmother. Following a near death drowning Scotty becomes embroiled in an affair with Mrs. Elster, using several attempts at psychoanalysis to try and find what is at the root of her mysterious illness.<br /><br />Hitchcock's hypnotic tale of suspense and intrigue builds itself around the premise of obsession and compulsive disorders. The director even conjured up a pre-sixties trippy montage sequence. Vertigo is shot rich in color with lots of moving lighting effects even simulating cloud clover over the sun. The choice of filming at a number of popular American landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge gives Vertigo its grandeur along with geographical attraction.<br /><br />The deconstruction of Scotty who goes mad towards the end of the film has a sense of urgency about it as he quickly becomes the `control freak' of all movies. It is an interesting note to see shop models wearing the clothes that people want to buy. The last scene invokes a sense of history repeating itself for those who try to free themselves of the past. Vertigo is classic Hitchcock.</p></body></html>

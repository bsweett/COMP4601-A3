<meta name="summary" content="BIG BLOATED DISAPPOINTMENT:  Indiana Jones and the Raiders of Your Wallet"></head><body><p>What a disappointment!<br /><br />The first movie, "Raiders of the Lost Ark" is just about perfect.  A terrific tale culled from Judeo-Christian mythology subverted by the core obsession of Hitler's occultic desperation.  Talk about good versus evil!  That was 27 years ago!<br /><br />But after a 19 year wait from the last Indiana  Jones movie and numerous official screenplays commissioned and then rejected by George Lucas, it is hard to believe that this is the absurd, overblown story that was finally agreed on by Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford. What happened to Frank Darabont's version?<br /><br />What "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is really about is three old men looting their fans' wallets with a highly anticipated and  decidedly empty parody of the original entry.  Did anyone have his heart in this enterprise?  A better title would be "Indiana Jones and the Raiders of Your Wallet."<br /><br />Shame.<br /><br />Nice atom bomb effect, though.</p></body></html>

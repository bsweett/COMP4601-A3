Lewis classic, the second in a series of seven novels. Here's the basic situation. Four siblings are relocated from their London home to a country estate to be with an eccentric uncle, Professor Kirke,  during the "Blitz." While playing a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy hides in a wardrobe and -- like Alice and Dorothy -- unexpectedly finds herself in a magical world. Later joined by her two brothers and sister, Lucy and they become involved in a conflict between what my grandson Cameron calls "the good guys" (led by a lion king named Aslan) and "the bad guys" (led by a witch named Jadis) at a time when a  curse (Jadis') has confined Narnia to perpetual winter but without Christmas. There is one way to break her curse -- best revealed within the narrative -- and eventually that happens but not until after a series of adventures which are always entertaining but never threatening to young sensibilities.<br /><br />As did Alice and Dorothy, Lucy and her companions encounter all manner of strange creatures (both allies and foes) which include hags, soldiers, a German pilot, Rumblebuffin the Giant, red and black dwarves, centaurs, satyrs, wolves, Philip the Horse, fauns, centaur archers, and gryphons. Eventually, after a spectacular battle, Jadis is defeated and the curse is ended. The special effects are stunning and I especially appreciate anthropomorphism which is never "cute." The actors who portray the four Pevensie children, especially Georgie Henley as Lucy, are exceptionally talented.  Cloying I can always do without.<br /><br />I think it would be a mistake to force comparisons and contrasts between this film and any of the Potter and Ring films. There are similarities and differences, to be sure, but none which seems to me to be especially significant. I thoroughly enjoyed this film because plot, acting, imagery, and musical score are so brilliantly integrated in the service of effective storytelling. Others may find -- and either admire or object to -- what they perceive to be the film's presentation of Lewis' Christian beliefs. What seems much more relevant to me is the emphasis on values common to all of the world's great religions and, indeed, to codes of ethics which are wholly secular. Faith, for example, as well as love, courage, devotion, loyalty, self-sacrifice, and trust. These values are affirmed but only by implication. Hence young Cameron's immediate grasp of what is "good" and "bad" in character and behavior.<br /><br />The production values are superb, the conflicts and their resolution are plausible, and the film's running of time of 134 minutes seems just right. This is a film which offers a great deal to viewers of all ages. As  my rating correctly indicates, I highly recommend it.<br /><br />The additional features provided in the two-disc Collector's Edition really are "special" and include a commentary in which Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, and director Andrew Adamson participate; a production commentary by director Andrew Adamson, production designer Roger Ford and producer Mark Johnson; "bloopers"; Narnia "fun facts"; several featurettes such as an in-depth look at cinematic storytellers, director's diary and the children's magical journey; also "Chronicle of a Director," "The Children's Magical Journey," and "Anatomy of a Scene: the Melting River." It takes about ten hours to view the two discs to completion. My guess (only a guess) is that most people will also view only those special features of greatest interest to them. My grandchildren (ranging in age from five to fourteen) seem to prefer watching only the film and do so again and again.</p></body></html>

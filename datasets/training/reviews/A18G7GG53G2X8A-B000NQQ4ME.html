I completely understood this statement as I left the theater; no matter where you live, no matter what your circumstances in life, no matter how "civilized" or "primitive" a culture, a society is still vulnerable to decline. What makes all the difference is whether or not it comes from within. This is the very idea the film is founded on, focusing on two different tribes of the Mayan civilization engaged in conflict. It raises some questions: would the Ancient Mayans have continued to prosper had they not been in turmoil? Would they have been able to resist the Spanish invasion if they were united instead of divided? These underlying themes of change made this one of the most unique experiences I've had at the movies.<br /><br />The word "apocalypto" is derived from Greek, translating as "I reveal." Many things are appropriately revealed is this film, most notably the fact that the basic human instincts of survival, love, fear, and hatred are universal; despite the exotic locals and the intense action, I felt a connection with the main characters that transcended such details. The story primarily focuses on Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), a young Mayan hunter living peacefully in a village with his pregnant wife, Seven (Dalia Hernandaz), and his little boy, Turtles Run (Carlos Emilio Baez). One morning, the village is brutally invaded by a warrior tribe. It's a nasty sight to behold: women are beaten and raped; children are forcefully dragged away; more than a couple of throats are slit. The physically capable adults are bound together, ready to be taken back to the opposing tribe's village.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw is one such captive. Luckily, he manages to save his wife and child by lowering them into a cave, one with many nooks and crannies for hiding. While the audience has no way of knowing how the situation will unfold, they still get the feeling that he knows he'll return for them. We certainly hope that that will be the case, especially when the opposing city is finally revealed. In this bustling metropolis: we see powder-coated slaves building massive structures; we see women being sold at auction; we see the men being painted blue; we see severed heads rolling down the steps of a looming pyramid serving as a sacrificial alter. Jaguar Paw is one of many captives scheduled for this fate, supposedly in the belief that their deaths will appease the gods and bring an end to a widespread famine. As he watches his companions' hearts being ripped out and heads being chopped off, he realizes something: he's not yet ready to go.<br /><br />Almost as soon as he comes to this realization, the solar eclipse darkens the sky, meaning that the gods' thirst for blood has been quenched (or so they would like to believe). Already, the more suspicious tribe members consider it the first sign of a prophecy, one described earlier by a little girl stricken with smallpox. This was the one scene in the entire film I had trouble understanding, despite the fact that it was a very effective scene; we first see her as a lonely soul who only wants some comfort. But after she's shunned for being ill, she starts spouting warnings as if she were a fortuneteller. She says that doom will follow the darkness of the sun, and that the man who runs with the jaguar will meet with a dark fate. I wondered whether or not this character was intended to be the creepy predictor of bad events; that seems a little too convenient for the plot.<br /><br />Still, she adds a nice touch of mystery to the story, and her warnings serve as perfect counterpoints to the inevitable chase sequence between Jaguar Paw and members of the rival tribe. At that point, the film becomes a full-blown action picture, full of heart pounding stunts and dangerous encounters (namely with a mother jaguar attempting to protect her cub). It's actually quite exciting to watch, considering Seven and Turtles Run are still waiting at the bottom of a cave. In order to reach his family, Jaguar Paw has to be quick, cunning, and merciless, pretty much to the point of becoming the enemy. Here's an interesting parallel: in order to return to the peaceful life he once knew, he has behave in ways that are anything but peaceful.<br /><br />Again, the theme of change is alluded to, and it's made implicitly clear by the arrival of the conquistador ships. Whether or not Jaguar Paw survives his ordeal, whether or not his family will pull through, it's obvious that nothing will ever be the same; it's a new beginning. Subtler images reinforce this idea, such as the birth of Jaguar Paw's second son in the midst of a flood (brought on by a torrential rainstorm). It seemed to me that "Apocalypto" was intentionally meant to be symbolic, with less attention devoted to story. But don't get the wrong idea; a definite story is being told. However, it's so basic that it's easily overshadowed by the thematic elements. At its core, it's a Daring Escape fable. But it's surrounded by a wealth of more complex ideas, specifically humanistic ones. This was a wise move on Mel Gibson's part; he's crafted a genuinely intriguing film, rich in detail and integrity.</p></body></html>

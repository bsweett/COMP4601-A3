<meta name="summary" content="THIRD TIMES A CHARM!"></head><body><p>this one was just another good addition to the resident evil series. these movies are explosive, all of them. my kind of movies. nothing beats the first one, no doubt, but they just keep getting better and better. i was not disappointed, and i honestly didn't expect to be. everything was good, the acting, the story, and all of the undead. the action was tops, and alice is sweet kicking all kinds of azz all over the place. man, milla jovovich was born for this role. can't nobody do it like her for real. she gots that hard core in your face appeal that you can't forget. the rest of her crew goes a long way as well. okay, if you don't know what it's about it's a continuation of the virus. it spread all over the world now, and there doesn't seem to be any stopping it. alice, as always is the key, and she's on the run. with only few survivors, who must fight and keep on the move to stay alive. while all the while the umbrella corporation needs alice to see if there is a way to reverse the infection. the battle continues, and there are to many undead and undead birds as well. nice part. new fighters are introduced, old friends reunite, and above all love is finally revealed. an action ride, with a little blood, some intense moments, and casualties that you just wish wouldn't have happened. blend it all together and you got an emotional flick on all these different levels. everybodies fighting one way or another. some of the scenes on here are pretty sweet. her main squeeze and action man, oded fehr, is once again dazzling. very nice. he does action like second nature. great actor. ali larter she kicked it here too. she gets down. ashanti, brief but good, and let's not forget mike epps. always nice to see a funny face. and milla jovovich was in her own world. all in all, i could see it over and over again.</p></body></html>

Dr. Loomis shot Michael Myers six times, he fell from the second level of the house, and managed to walk away before Dr. Loomis could notice.  This continued fight for Laurie Strode's life and the struggle to capture Michael Myers has many gripping scenes that make this sequel better than most other movie sequels.  The multiple unexpected twists and turns give the horror genre a great name.  Such action keeps audiences interested the whole time.  In the meantime, secrets are revealed about Myers's motives, and the most surprising one is in this &quot;Halloween&quot; edition.  All events blend wonderfully, leading to a powerful conclusion.  Jamie Lee Curtis beautifully plays Strode, maintaining her character throughout the movie.  All of her actions, namely her injury, are convincing.  Donald Pleasence plays Dr. Loomis wonderfully, adding his own sense of struggle into the movie's theme.  All other actors also perform their roles wonderfully.  &quot;Halloween 2&quot; is a great movie to watch on Halloween or any other day that feels right.  This is sure to please many horror movie fans.  Anyone interested in watching this movie should watch part one first.  Otherwise, everything will be confusing.</p></body></html>

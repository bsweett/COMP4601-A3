While it is part of his Spaghetti Western Trilogy( all three films have different characters and plots), the film stands on its own and really shows you how good a movie can really be.  This movie has it all.  It has action, drama and even some comic relief in it.  It is a timeless classic that is unforgettable.  When I first saw it, I was a little kid and couldn't truly appreciate it as I can now at age 22.<br /><br />Blondie (The Man with No Name) isn't your typical good guy.  He mainly does things that suits his own agenda.  However, when compared to the murderous Angel Eyes and the greedy Tuco, Blondie is a saint.  This tale involves bloodshed, shoot-outs, search for treasure, and double-crossing.  And it all takes place while the Civil War is going on, which makes things a lot more "interesting" for the notorious three.  The West has never been wilder or more unpredictable than it is now.  With an incredible score, excellent acting, and superb story-telling, this is one memorable film that you will never forget.<br /><br />As I said in the beginning, the first time I saw this was when I was a little kid.  When I just recently purchased this new edition of the movie, it truly was like I was watching it for the first time.  Coming from a guy who isn't a big fan of Westerns (I don't mind them, but I don't watch too many of them), I absolutely LOVED this film.  In fact, I wanted to give it a standing ovation when it was all said and done due to how moved I was by it.  This really is filmmaking at its finest.  I wasn't terribly impressed with Leone's "Once Upon a Time in America," but he is absolutely flawless with this amazing and timeless Western.  It is slower than the second film ("For a Few Dollars More"), but I think that makes this all the better.  The build up of tension is much more present in this film, and you really get the sense that these characters are real people.  Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach are brilliant in their roles, and a lot of props need to go to Lee Van Cleef as he is absolutely chilling in his role.<br /><br />This new edition really does the film the justice it deserves.  The film has been restored to the director's original vision as much as possible, giving you an extra 18 minutes.  You will notice the added scenes as the voices have been re-dubbed (the first time you will notice this will throw you, as I think that specific part has the worst re-dubbing, but the other added scenes are done a lot better, even if you still notice it).  The picture looks incredible and the sound is great.  Extras included are commentary from Richard Schickel, a couple of documentaries and featurettes, poster gallery, deleted scenes and the original theatrical trailer.  Along with the nice packaging, you get an 8-page booklet that includes pictures from the film along with Roger Ebert's most recent review of the film.  And, you get some mini-posters included inside the packaging as well.  A superior edition of the movie, without question.<br /><br />"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is a pure triumph in filmmaking and should be seen by everybody at least once.  Don't let the fact that this is a Western throw you.  I think this can be enjoyed by everybody, and even by those who are not big fans of Westerns.  A film filled with authentic emotion and action, this is one that shouldn't be missed by anyone.  I LOVE this movie, and I cannot express that enough. -Michael Crane</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Drama about a Class-Action Suit"></head><body><p>The film begins with scenes of New York city. A man is talking in an emotional voice. He works for a big law firm. A reporter calls for information but gets nothing. Men are playing poker, one gets a phone call. Michael Clayton will handle this problem, and drove to Westchester to see a man who is a difficult client. [Some lawyers make house calls to rich clients.] Clayton stops to view some horses; then his car blows up! The story shifts to four days earlier. Michael sells things to raise money, he is in deep debt. He knows people and can arrange things, a "fixer". Will this big law firm be bought up by another law firm? [The sequence of scenes is a little confusing.]<br /><br />One lawyer has a problem. Arthur is in jail after he went off his medication. [Is this another industrial disease?] "I guess that's it." We learn more about Michael Clayton. The background facts slowly seep out. [The story drags here.] Michael is told to pay up what he owes in one week. Do law firms hire private detectives to check on their employees? "Then who are you?" Arthur found out that a farm product can cause cancer in northern climates! "There's the other way." They make it look like a suicide. Why was there no note? Michael calls Anna and gets a surprise. Will he investigate on his own? Will somebody call 9-11? There are complications.<br /><br />"We have a situation." Michael should know how his law firm pays the rent. The story continues, and we see what was done. The story repeats from the beginning [as if to pad out the film]. The suspense picks up. [Is there symbolism in the car brands?] We see what happens next. One lawyer explains the reasons for a settlement this year. Michael talks to Karen and makes a deal. Will there be a surprise and a happy ending?<br /><br />This would be a better film without the confusing sequence of events. Some scenes go nowhere. Overall it's a good story in spite of the many scenes that serve as distractions, or aren't believable. Unneeded scenes drive up costs. One problem is the `suicide' of Arthur. He seemed to die from an overdose of his medication but there would be no pills in his stomach when they did the required autopsy for a violent death. Using Karen as the villain suggests an unusual point of view, or an agenda. Was there a real reason to blow up Michael's car?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great battle sequences, but fails utterly as history..."></head><body><p>&quot;The Patriot&quot; has stunning battle sequences that show war in its full horrific reality, but displays a stunning lack of historical accuracy and moral courage. This is a film that shows people giving their lives by the thousands for freedom, but at its end, cozies up to the idea that some Americans (read: slaves) weren't all that unhappy not to be free.<p>It's this hypocritical glossing over of historical fact that ultimately sinks &quot;The Patriot&quot;, and that's a shame, because the film has many strengths, including its depiction of the brutality of combat, marvelous period feel and set design, and a very strong performance by Mel Gibson.<p>If you've forgotten why war is a nightmare that must be avoided at all costs - all to easy to do in today's world, where war looks like Nintendo - consider &quot;The Patriot&quot; your wake up call. <p>The Revolutionary War wasn't fought with smart bombs, Stealth fighters and TV footage...it was fought with vast armies of men that showed up together on a battlefield and proceeded to brutally kill each other with cannons, rifles, bayonets, knives, rocks, or anything else. More than any other film in history, &quot;The Patriot&quot; shows this old-style warfare in its utter brutality and scale. It's remarkable.<p>Unfortunately for &quot;The Patriot&quot;, the accuracy of its battle scenes doesn't make up for its utter ignorance of history or glossing over the greatest human rights issue in our nation's history.  <p>Gibson stars as Benjamin Martin, a widower and veteran of the French and Indian Wars. As revolutionary talk spreads, Martin would rather stay home and tend his plantation (yep, it comes complete with all-too-helpful and all-too-happy slaves). But Martin is drawn into the conflict when British officer Tavington decides to go on a Nazi-style mission of destruction against Martin, killing one of his kids, imprisoning another for the heck of it, and burning his house down. And wouldn't you just know it...Martin ends up being a one-man army of destruction against the Brits.<p>Anyone who has even opened up a history book about the revolution knows that even in their worst moments, the Brits NEVER even approached the consistent level of indiscriminate, Nazi-style brutality portrayed in &quot;The Patriot&quot;. Unfortunately, that's the impression that this movie gives, and in an age where kids can't remember when the Civil War was fought, such blatant historical inaccuracy is downright irresponsible.<p>Then there's the depiction of slavery, which is utterly ridiculous and borderline insulting. First off, I have very little sympathy for someone who fights for freedom but owns slaves, and Martin is a slaveowner. For this viewer, that fact drained the Martin character of every bit of nobility, despite Gibson's excellent performance.<p>One of Martin's slaves joins the revolution because George Washington has promised freedom for any slave who fights. So what's the first thing this newly-freed slave wants to do after the war's over? He wants to rebuild Martin's house. <p>Huh? This guy is free and the first thing he wants to do is hang out with 'Massuh' and rebuild his house? Man, how much did they have to pay a black actor to buy into this racist apologist drivel?<p>That's what I found most disturbing about this film: after showing us brutal battle after brutal battle, all fought in the name of freedom, &quot;The Patriot&quot; glosses over the fact that after the battles were done, millions of Americans weren't free at all.<p>Talk about an opportunity lost...wouldn't it have been better to confront Martin with his hypocrisy after sacrificing so much in the name of freedom? Why couldn't he realize that when some Americans weren't free, NO Americans were really free? Now that would have been a ending with teeth...as it is, we get feel-good namby pamby.<p>So there you have it, folks: &quot;The Patriot&quot; is a historical drama that honors history in its depiction of violence but ignores it in its depiction of the British, and glosses over the reality that freedom wasn't really freedom for many Americans.</p></body></html>

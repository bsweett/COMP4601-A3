A very simplistic science fiction plot, but I guess good for middle schoolers, who may find it easier to suspend reason.  Will Smith is a good actor, no doubt, but the plot was a little far fetched for me, the evil machine against the good heart of man.  This will be very popular with the U.S. masses.</p></body></html>

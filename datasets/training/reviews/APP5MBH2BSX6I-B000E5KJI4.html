<meta name="summary" content="Good date movie"></head><body><p>Many milennia ago, so far back that even historians can't pin it down, a man named Homer apparently wrote an epic Greek tragedy entitled "The Iliad."  Even that isn't entirely sure.  The existence of Troy, even longer ago, is a bit more sure, as is the belief that said Troy was involved in a war like the one depicted in this film.  Other than those generally accepted facts, it isn't known how much of "The Iliad" is myth or reality, although some of the characters are Greek gods and goddesses, which makes it easier to figure which parts of Homer's story might be myth.  So, let's not get all worked up about how historically accurate this film is, OK?<br /><br />Those who know something about "The Iliad" will at least be interested to see how director Wolfgang Petersen and the staff of this production demythologize the story of Achilles, his heel, the Trojan horse, the man for whom Paris is named, and Helen of Troy whose face launched a thousand ships.  Many have had little good to say about the adaptation.  I'll say some good things, however.<br /><br />For one, I bought Brad Pitt in the role of Achilles, although his character has been overwhelmingly modernized, like almost everything else in this version of the ancient tale.  A loner, the world's greatest warrior, iconoclast, apathetic in the extreme where politics is concerned, Achilles is presented as the kind of character who might say the modern line, "The men want to be me and the women want to be with me."  Along the lines of eye candy for the guys, there's Diane Kruger, the lovely young lady who portrays Helen of Troy, her face truly worthy of seamanship on a mass scale.  Also excellent in supporting roles are Sean Bean as Achilles' adviser, Odysseus, and Brian Cox as the boastful Greek warlord Agamemnon.<br /><br />It's a story on a vast scale, a tale of love, war, and tragedy.  So, expect romantic moments, huge battle scenes, and an unhappy yet appropriate ending.<br /><br />There, however, the good news ends, for the most part.<br /><br />The memorable and gripping moments of "Troy" are also unfortunately interspersed with some truly embarrassing scenes.  One that comes to mind is when Achilles hews off the head of a golden statue with his sword.  This would be fine if he had been presented as a supernatural figure, as he was in "The Iliad," but remember, we have no gods in this film other than when their names are referenced by the all too human characters on screen.  No sword would truly hold up to a massive slab of gold, and the scene is ridiculous as a result.  Even worse are some incredibly melodramatic moments early in the film where a character's closeup is actually held for a couple of seconds while the film is switched to slo-mo until fadeout.  Nothing could possibly be more cornball, except perhaps the dialogue.  Julie Christie, in a cameo as Achilles' mother, is forced to spew some of the most horrid dialogue heard in recent years.  Scenes like hers set the motion picture industry back 50 years to the days of the hamminess of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.  Yeech.<br /><br />And then there's the late great Peter O'Toole.  Oh, sorry, he's not dead?  Well, he looks it.  Aside from a touching scene in private with Pitt's Achilles, O'Toole, as the king of Troy, is seemingly one step away from the nursing home, both in looks and actions.  He's barely recognizable, the poor old sot.  Yet another parable about the destructive powers of strong drink, that man.<br /><br />And the battle scenes are so "Lord Of the Rings"-like as to be blatantly obvious even to those who haven't seen any of the LOtR films.  It was once clever to computerize a few hundred extras and replicate them to become many thousands, but now it just looks cheesy.  Or maybe that's just "Troy" working its questionable magic again.<br /><br />By the end of the film I was really unsure whether to be glad it was over, savor the occasional satisfying scene, or be sickened at the way the memorable fable of Achilles' heel is turned into almost nothing.  Upon further review, it's a bit of both.  "Troy" really has some fine moments and also some that are laughably bad.  Please don't take the film seriously, and you just might enjoy it as a rental.  I would not recommend a purchase.  "Das Boot," Petersen's first film to make an international splash, remains his best work by far, "The Perfect Storm" notwithstanding.</p></body></html>

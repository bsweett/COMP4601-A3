<meta name="summary" content="Once Again ---- Entertainment"></head><body><p>Could have done with out the nude doll [wether she be alive or dead] and still can't tumble to the vulgar language [a guy thing? must be they can't articulate themselves].<br />Enjoyed the plot [game?? never saw it] great acting by Urban, the Rock and the rest - I can take the blood and guts - thoroughly enjoyed the features with the make of the monsters and Rock's make-up explanation - and their training in weapons.<br />Have great admiration for any man in the Special Forces and their abilities.<br /><br />Never did figure out #24 - it's use - super people??<br />Did so enjoy the plot - the pace - the inhumans [or whatever] - the dark side of it all.<br /><br />All right for most? adults? sure not even a teenage movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Smooth Operator Moves Into the Music Industry..."></head><body><p>Be Cool opens with ex-mobster Chili Palmer (John Travolta) scorning sequels, as he says "But sometimes you have to do it the studio way."  The irony in this scene reflects on the notion that this is the sequel to Get Shorty (1995) where Chili travels to Hollywood in order to collect money and to his amazement discovers that the film industry has close resemblance with the workings of the underworld.  This time the audience quickly learns that Chili has grown tired of the movie industry and wants to revamp his career.  Through an incident where his friend Tommy Athens (James Woods) is shot in broad daylight by the ruthless Russian mafia and an altercation at a nightclub he decides to enter the music industry.  This is a business that unfortunately has claimed several artists' lives such as Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG, but in this version the audience will experience a highly amusing gangster tale in the music world.<br /><br />Chili is the epitome of coolness as he always says and does the right things at the right time.  He never fails for a second, as he continues to stay two steps ahead of those who move in on his turf.  Calmness surrounds his persona that never budges to pressure or threats, as he pursues his new career as a producer in the music industry.  Several characters comment on Chili's aspirations as a new up and coming music producer, and they all say his ideas are too lofty and will never work.  Yet, Chili gains peoples trust and interest through his cool existence, which always remains polite and helpful even at gunpoint.<br /><br />Through careful management of people, Chili quickly climbs the ranks as a music producer, as he signs his first talent Linda Moon (Christina Milian) who he simply frees from another record company.  This however draws bad blood between him and those who wants to keep Linda under contract.  In particular, there is a minor co-producer with an inferiority complex called Raji (Vince Vaughn) who pulls his self-denying gay bodyguard Elliot Wilhelm (The Rock) into a messy situation where he attempts to find a way to get Chili out of his way through any means possible.  To further complicate things Chili also finds himself inheriting Tommy's debt of $300,000 to Sin LaSalle (Cedric the Entertainer), a money hungry music mogul, and the Russian mafia wants nothing else than removing Chili from the face of the planet.<br /><br />In this intriguing jumble of comical side plots, music, and guns it will bring the audience through a guilty pleasure of laughter and amusement that keeps the wink in the eye.  Ultimately, Chili ties it all together with his cool presence, as he continues as if it was business as usual.  Much of the enjoyment rests with in F. Gary Gray's direction that makes another funny and intriguing tale.  Another element that elevates the film's quality is the wide range of music in the film as it uses country, rap, rock, and much more.  The film also offers several interesting cameos that will elevate the film's cool feeling that film tries to induce.  Be Cool might not measure up with his debut film Friday (1995), or The Italian Job (2003) when it comes to action, but he will definitely offer something to laugh about while leave the audience entertained.</p></body></html>

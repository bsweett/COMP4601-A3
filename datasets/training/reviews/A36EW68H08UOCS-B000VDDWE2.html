<meta name="summary" content="How willing are you to overlook a ridiculous plot?"></head><body><p>Although my rating for this is 2 stars - one of my lowest ratings ever for a DVD - I'm going to be up front with you, be honest and say:  This movie MAY be right up your alley.  It really depends on how willing you are to overlook a story that could have been written by a high school prom committee that suddenly found themselves in possession of several cameras and 50 million dollars worth of special effects.<br /><br />You've HEARD (or read) the plot outline, right?  New Ice Age comes and covers most of the Northern Hemisphere and a handful of smart/brave Americans save..... well, they don't save all of the Northern Hemisphere, but they at least save themselves.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid is a good and reliable actor, and in some roles I can readily accept him.  As an almost-washed-up Texas High School Baseball coach I buy it.  As one of the "Cutters" in "Breaking Away", he was powerful and brooding.  In "Day" he plays basically the genius scientist who predicts disaster but those dummies in the government don't believe him.  Not only was it hard for me to believe him in this role - I kept telling myself that it is a pretty weak "save the world" movie that essentially uses a weatherman as it's hero.<br /><br />Ian Holm is absolutely fantastic and totally believable as an ally weatherman over in Britain, but Sir Ian's screen time is minimal and his character disappears before the 2nd act, never to be heard from again.<br /><br />The "star" of the movie, of course, are the special effects, and they LOOK good.  But while I'm watching a guilty-pleasure extended sequence where a whole herd of tornadoes waltz through Los Angeles I was thinking...."just HOW was it that global warming causing disturbances in the polar ice cap and North Atlantic caused tornadoes in Southern California?"<br /><br />I'd buy "El Nino" or the recent string of Hurricanes through Florida first.<br /><br />The "fun" parts of this movie could have been condensed into a 15 minute special effects extravaganza and left out the absolutely ludicrous and impossible stories about our heroes and their impossible survival through a cold front so cold that earlier in the movie 3 British Helicopters are frozen in mid-air and crash - just from the cold.  To emphasize how cold it is one of the crewmen starts clawing his way out of the downed chopper, before freezing solid beginning at the tip of his nose.<br /><br />Our little band of characters, the ones we KNOW are going to "make it" not only live through that wave of cold air - but there are scenes where we see them running ahead of the freeze.... in sort of the same way teenagers flee from Jason in the Friday 13th movies.<br /><br />So.... if you want to see a lot of North America wiped out by bad weather - you've come to the RIGHT movie.  If you insist that your movies make logical sense.... keep on moving folks, there's nothing to see here.</p></body></html>

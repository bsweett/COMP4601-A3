<meta name="summary" content="An ambitious undertaking that succeeds in many ways."></head><body><p>I have to give the director, producers, actors, and screen writers credit for taking on an ambitious project that is destined not to please everyone. There are both strengths and weaknesses to the film.<br /><br />First, the strengths, of which there are many. The film does a relatively admirable job of portraying historic events, while maintaining the pace of an action thriller, while integrating thoughtful dialogue regarding the cyclic nature of revenge. The events at the 1972 Olympic games in Munich were shocking and stunned the world. The Black Sunday group, associated with the Palestinian Liberation Organization, conduct a kidnapping and mass murder in front of the entire world. The film does an exceptional job of capturing this horrific series of events. The film also does an admirable job of capturing the political dialogue between Golda Meir and her cabinet after the events. The cast is exceptional with Eric Bana playing Avner, the assassin, with considerable depth and skill. Bana's performance was superb. Avner is joined by a team of collegues who help him track down 9 of the 11 terrorists or those who planned the event. Geoffrey Rush is excellent as Ephraim, the team's only contact with the Israelis. Daniel Craig as Steve and Ciaran Hinds as Carl are outstanding. The French informant, Louis, played by the French actor Mathieu Amalric, is great. The dialogue is excellent, much of it written by the very talented Tony Kushner. It is the dialogue that is interwoven with the action sequences that pushes the film to a higher motive. The scene where Eric Bana, acting as if he is a German, dialogues with a young Palestinian about the claiming of Israel by both the Jews and the Palestinians. Of course this is no James Bond thriller where everything goes as planned. In fact, nothing really goes as planned  and it is the unexpected that gives the film tension. However the most outstanding change in plot occurs when the team realizes that they may be the hunters but someone is hunting them!<br /><br />There were two issues that kept me from giving the film 5 stars. First, the writers decided not to get into a messy group of hundreds of informers and contacts and instead decided to write the story as if some French underground family supplied the team the names, addresses, and iteneraries of all the major PLO terrorist leadership. Whereas this certainly simplified the story, it certainly seems beyond belief. It appeared to be a literary license the screen writers took to cover up hundreds of persons who were involved in this series of revenge killings across Europe. My second criticism is the flashbacks that Avner has throughout the film of the actual events in Munich. Whereas this worked well to continually remind the viewer of the reasons this team is hunting down the PLO planners, leaders, and soldiers; it reached the point of overkill when Avner flashes back to the final minutes where the athletes were killed in the two  helicopters. Avner has this flashback while having intercourse with his wife so that the moment of death for the Israeli athletes corresponds with Avner's orgasm. What is the point here? I interpreted this that despite the murder of Jews, they will continue to thrive, defend themselves, and will successfully survive on this earth despite the hatred and prejudice.<br /><br />At 2 hours and 44 minutes, it is a long film, but will keep you engaged every second!</p></body></html>

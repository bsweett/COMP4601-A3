I recall that Kutcher has never made a film like this, and his first thriller was somewhat peculiar. Not just any old thriller, this one would keep you on the edge of your seat from the start to the finish. A weird title however, but the tag line explains all. Change one thing, change everything. I think this automatically gets you thinking, and as the film proceeds, it gets harder.<br /><br />As you may all already be aware, there are two versions of the film (well the Ending) and they both have completely different appeal, for me the directors ending is superior, it is more unexpected and far more shocking, but it does end the film on a slight downer, which is why the original release was happier (even though it didn't really fit the film).</p></body></html>

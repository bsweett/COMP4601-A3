<meta name="summary" content="Awful... useless... one of the worst movies ever!"></head><body><p>I could not believe it. This os simply one of the worst movies ever. IT's cheap, sickening, useless. IT does not serve even as mindless fun. evn if your turn off your brain, your senses will alert you how the intentions of the producers are fake, from the absurd lack of lightning (where you can't see the fights), to fast editing, through horrible "acting" and obnoxious directing (by two guys!)<br /><br />It's onet of the worst movies ever, where producers thought: "This is trash, but some people will enjoy it". It's the worst that Hollywwod can offer.<br /><br />Yes, I'm a sucker, because I've watched it. I did not even rent it, or downloaded it, I BOUGHT the DVD! (because, believe it or not, I thought the fist movies, although completely unecessary and forgettable twenty minutes after leaving the theater, an enjoyable one).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Caught it and Loved It"></head><body><p>Steven Spielberg has shown once again why he's the best director in hollywood.<p>Catch Me If You Can tells the story of a conman named Frank Abagnale Jr.(DiCaprio) Frank fakes being a pilot and starts writing fraud checks and all before the age of 18.<p>He is pursued by a federal agent Carl Hanratty(Tom Hanks). Hanks figures out that he's doing it and the chase is on.<p>You see Frank impersonate so many different people in the movie. Leo plays perfectly. I liked him a lot in this and it's his best performance since Titanic.<p>Tom Hanks is awesome. What else would you expect from him. The only problem is that they don't develop his character as much as I'd like.<p>Overall it's a great movie. I own it and I love it. It shows an interesting story and I'd recommend it to anybody.</p></body></html>

It had great actors (Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart), a halfway decent plot and good special effects. So what's my problem? I didn't actually CARE about any of the characters...It fails on the gut level. Part of the problem is that the movie is very short, so there is no room for real character development.<p>I'm comparing this movie to the Michael Keaton Batman flicks. Now THAT's how you turn a comic book into a movie! This is closer to Batman Returns (which I give 2 stars) than to Batman (5 stars).<p>Rent, don't buy. (I unfortunately bought the DVD without having seen the flick. Wanna buy mine?)</p></body></html>

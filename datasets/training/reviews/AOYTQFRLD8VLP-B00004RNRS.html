<meta name="summary" content="The Triumph of Virtue"></head><body><p>This beloved 1965 classic--one of the world's favorite things-- has all the elements of an Academy Award winner: Exquisite scenery, a compelling story, children, religion, romance, characters serving as comic relief,a memorable musical score, and one family's ultimate triumph over evil.<br />  Based on the true story of former Naval Captain Georg Von Trapp and his second wife, Maria Augusta Kutschera, the film greets us with a serene and panoramic view of the Austrian landscape on a lovely spring day.<br />  High on a green hilltop, momentarily escaping from her convent, is the bobbed haired, pinner-clad novice, Maria( the formidable Julie Andrews) initiating the Rodgers and Hammerstein score by singing the title song, which could not express the communion of music and escaping to nature to find  joy and solace more perfectly.<br /> As urgent as the call of the natural world feels to Maria, the urgent call of the  chapel bell soon  compels her return to the spiritual world of Nonnberg Abbey, where the are nuns gathering for Mass to which Maria will be quite characteristically late.<br />  Peggy Wood's Mother Abbess is a patient woman regarding Maria's shenanigans, but this is not the case with her assistant, Sister Berthe( Portia Nelson). Along with Sisters Margaretta, Sophia, and Bernice,( Anna Lee, Marni Nixon,and Evandne Baker),she ponders her dilemma regarding the renegade novice.<br />  For the Mother Abbess, the answer seems to be to send Maria out into the world as a governess to the seven children of a retired and widowered sea captain.<br /> Little does Maria realize she is being called to bring a somber household back to life.<br />  Reluctantly, she begins her journey, filled with trepidation. Slowly building herself up with her "pep song", "I Have Confidence", her feelings of assertiveness wane as she approaches the estate. Greeted rather coldly by the family's butler, Franz(Gil Stuart)upon her arrival, she wanders into the sealed-off ballroom, genuflecting and wondering how she should present herself to the nobleman who is her new boss.<br /> But the gruff captain( a cooly elegant Christopher Plummer) encounters her at the ballroom's entrance. Once they meet, their relationship is a bit antagonistic. But soon, the captain blows his whistle and six of Maria's new charges march downstairs clad in sailor suits to greet her. These include the eldest, 16-year-old Liesl(Charmain Carr), 14-year-old Frederich(Nicholas Hammond), 13-year-old Louisa(Heather Menzies),11-year-old Kurt(Duane Chase), 7-year-old Marta(Debbie Turner), and pug tressed,5-year-old Gretl(Kym Karath). Displaying the same penchant Maria has for tardiness, 10-year-old Brigitta(Angela Cartwright), distracted by another matter, arrives on the scene later.<br /> Maria withstands the pranks of the children to psyche them out at the dinnertable, from which Liesl excuses herself upon learning that her young swain Rolfe(Daniel Truhitte) is close at hand.<br /> The budding romance of the teenagers gives an enchanting moment as the two get caught in the rain.<br /> Housekeeper Frau Schmidt( Norma Varden) helps Maria settle in. Soon, despite Captain Von Trapp's rules about the strict observance of bedtime,  Maria finds herself consoling the youngsters by making them think of their favorite things during the thunderstorm,and proving her worth to the initially skeptical Liesl as well.The captain arrives to express his displeasure. But Maria has plans of her own.<br /> While enduring one of the Captain's many absences, Maria makes the children some play clothes from old bedroom drapes, takes them on outings, and teaches them to sing in multipart harmony as an alternative to playing pranks to get their father's attention.<br /> As the musical education of the Von Trapp children gets underway amid the fabulous urban and rural scenes of Salzburg, their father returns with a couple of very interesting and influential guests, namely, Baroness Ilsa Schroeder(Eleanor Parker), and a chaperoning concert promoter, Max Detweiler(Richard Haydn). As the three gather on the terrace, Rolfe, hoping to contact Liesl, and deliver another relevant message, proves to be a nuisance, hiding behind membership in the HitlerJugend when confronted by the captain.<br /> Soon the captain and his guests are greeted by the joyous band of Maria and the children as they fall from a boat and into the lake at the edge of the terrace.When reprimanded by the captain, Maria defends herself, and openly criticizes his inattentiveness to his children almost at the expense of her job.But the childrens' song for the Baroness and the Captain's joining them in song at the last moment breaks down a long-standing barrier between a grief-stricken man and his children. Maria is allowed to stay.<br /> The second half of the story finds the family in sunnier circumstances, expressing their love of music (as is typically Austrian) through a colorful puppet show, and by the childrens' urging their father to recite a song he hasn't sung in years, accompanied by Liesl.<br /> But Baroness Schroeder begins to see Maria as a rival for the Captain's affections, and her plotting to marry him begins in earnest. Convincing Georg to host a ball to introduce her to his friends, Ilsa acts as a gracious hostess, accompanied by Max and Georg.<br /> Georg's intercessions of Maria's teaching Kurt the Landler causes the Baroness to step up her scheming against Maria, and Max steps up his scheming to have the children in the Salzburg Music Festival after the children charm guests with their good-night song.<br /> A meeting between the two women results in Maria's sudden return to Nonnberg Abbey, leaving behind the heartbroken children, who may end up with an uncaring stepmother.There is evidence during Ilsa's unenthusiastic ball game with the children that Liesl suspects the truth.<br /> A visit to the Abbey, during which the children are turned away from seeing Maria sets the course of more favorable events in motion. The young novice soon has a glad reunion with her charges when ordered to return to the family. The Baroness concedes defeat, acknowledging her incompatability with Georg's family, clearing the way for a beautiful and stately wedding between the captain and Maria in what are truly the Last Golden Days of the Thirties.<br /> The couple return from their honeymoon amid the Anschluss, during which Herr Zeller(Ben Wright) once a guest in the Von Trapp Home, has been named the Gauleiter of Salzburg and shadowy events that were only peripheral during much of the story become central. Rolfe's relationship with Liesl changes.<br /> Georg is soon ordered to fill a postion in the German Navy, and in an act of true moral courage, this truly noble family leave their beloved Austria behind amid moments of poignancy and solidarity with fellow Austrians, the distress of pursuit by those who would compromise them, and the benediction of the Benedictine nuns(two of whom tip the balance in their favor). We leave them en route to a new life elsewhere in one of the most triumphant moments in cinematic history.<br /> The film takes liberties with some aspects of the story while remaining true to others. But in writing this tribute on the 45th anniversary of this film's release, it is considered opinion that the film's message of the triumph of virtue, and the soaring spirit of this enduring classic will continue through the ages.</p></body></html>

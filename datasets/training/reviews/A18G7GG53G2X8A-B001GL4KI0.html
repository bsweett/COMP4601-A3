This is due to more than just CGI; there's also a surreal quality to the characters, their skin a little too smooth and their complexions a little too vibrant to pass off as realistic. No question about it; it was fascinating to look at. And let's not forget the high tech shots of firearms and swords materializing from tiny devices worn on the assailants' wrists. That was fascinating to look at, as well. But as with a lot of big budget action flicks, this is a visually stunning piece that lags behind on story and dialogue, and for the general movie going population, it would only come off as a headache inducing music video.<br /><br />But for the comic book buffs and action film junkies, these are qualities that just might make their day. Made in the tradition of adrenaline pumping sci-fi films like the "Matrix" Trilogy (and even more so like the "Underworld" films), "Ultraviolet" is a perfect example of a film adapted from original comic book material: it's overwhelmingly frenetic, filled to the brim with highly choreographed fight sequences and completely saturated with futuristic details (including architecture, weapons, and costumes; one building is shaped like the biohazard symbol). Its energetic pace is enhanced by means of Klaus Badelt's throbbing score, an opus inspired by the hypnotic beats of techno clubs. At times I wondered why they even bothered trying to come up with a story; the battle scenes were entertaining enough, as was seeing Milla Jovovich in yet another superhero-type role. (And we all know she's not too bad looking; why else would a few seconds be reserved to show her exposed behind?).<br /><br />But if you're hoping to experience a meaningful story with a cleverly disguised hidden message, then this is the wrong movie for you. Set in some distant yet unspecified future year, the movie begins with the voiceover narration of Violet (Milla Jovovich), saying, "I was born into a world you probably wouldn't understand." She goes on to say that, in an attempt to eradicate a deadly viral infection, the government's scientists only managed to make it stronger. It then spread quickly, mutating countless numbers of civilians into a race of modernized vampires called Hemophanges, humanoids with superior skill and intelligence. Many of them are then taken away and exterminated (and this parallels history with disturbing accuracy). But a few survived, and they are the ones who fight back.<br /><br />And it's a good thing, too. A militant government corporation led by the organized and seemingly germophobic Daxus (Nick Chinlund) has apparently developed a secret weapon meant to exterminate Hemophanges once and for all. Violet is sent to retrieve this weapon, and she painstakingly does so, going through scores of guards and security personnel with her lightening fast reflexes and razor sharp senses (along with a few well places slices of her machete-type blade).<br /><br />The initially straightforward plan unravels when she takes a peek inside the weapon case and discovers a human child. His name is Six (Cameron Bright), a quiet, somewhat melodramatic character that has been genetically modified. How and for what purpose is one of the mysteries of the story, which wouldn't have been so bad had a fewer number of twists and revelations been used. Everything we suspect about him is disregarded at one point or another, and after a while, it becomes exhausting trying to invest in an unknowable character. (And has Bright ever played a normal child? All he seems to be able to play are brooding, disturbed children, like in "Godsend," and "Birth.") The only way to determine anything at all about him is to analyze his relationship with Violet. At first, she only sees him as a means to save her own life. But as the story progresses, she grows more and more attached to him. There is a specific reason for this, but telling you what it is would be giving too much away. Let's just say that her life experiences have left lasting impressions.<br /><br />I think the biggest problem this film has is that certain things are just too unbelievable, even for a comic book. For one thing, Violet has the ability to defeat dozens of artillery and self-defense trained guards with minimal effort. You'd think this could be excused; remember that Hemophanges are physically superior to humans, and because of this, they should be able to take on any form of attack. Yet Daxus and his men are able to gun down Violet's comrades as easily as if they were swatting flies. Does this mean that somehow she's an even more superior being? I would have liked it if the film had answered this question, but since they didn't, all I can do is guess that it was for the sake of plot advancement.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the plot has so many holes in it that any form of advancement would be incoherent. Such a large chunk of necessary information is left in the dark, most of which is detail regarding Violet and the government (in other words; all the main characters). None of this is helped much by the amateurish dialogue: a blending of first-draft-quality one liners and fragmented attempts at voiceover summations. Granted, a lot of comic books are written like that, and if you enjoy reading them, then you'll probably find that "Ultraviolet" succeeds in every way. I'm sure the violence will keep many people cheering and hollering (even though this is a virtually gore free film). And the special effects are top notch; who cares whether or not they harm an already weak story instead of help it? Some don't care, and for them, this film will be waiting. For everyone else, it's best to just avoid it altogether.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Too Much Cussing and Nudity"></head><body><p>Would have enjoyed this movie much more if the porn scenes and profanity had been taken out (or reduced substantially).  It was funny, romantic, touching, etc., with some really memorable scenes (proposal in the Portuguese restaurant and scene in the airport involving young boy and his first love).<br /><br />The nudity and curse words (including cussing by a young child) was just completely unnecessary.  I'm not usually a Hugh Grant fan, but I must say he did an excellent job as the smitten British Prime Minister.  There are too many star actors and actresses to name, but all made this film exceptional.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Marred by Cliche"></head><body><p>This is a fairly good film, full of brooding and stalking. However my enthusiasm for the film was tempered a little by the clich&eacute; of its central theme - which is the obsession that one police detective develops with the case.<br /><br />The worst part of the clich&eacute; is the way the detective's wife is relegated to the shadows while he pursues his obsession. Actually, women play virtually no role in this film at all, except as victims. The whole film is the importance of men's concentrations. The detective's wife really has only one notable line in the movie, and that's to fadingly worry whether the carrots or some other dishes she's prepared for dinner - are warm enough. Eventually, as always happens in these cases, the marriage dissolves altogether and the detective is left to ponder the evidence in a state of increasing isolation and disintegration.<br /><br />How refreshing it would be to just once see a spouse plunge into an investigation with equal interest, the way Daphne does on an episode of "Frasier," the TV sitcom. When health care provider Daphne sees Martin, the retired policeman, pouring over some old photos of a cold case murdered prostitute, she doesn't cringe, whine, and worry. She commands, "Here, don't be a greedy guts! Let me have a look!"<br /><br />Of course, the Zodiac murders were no joke. But the spectacle of yet one more detective degenerating into the puzzle detracts from the unique seriousness of the case. There are also some splotches of illogic that detract from the film. For example, at one point the vulnerable detective accompanies a supremely creepy suspect down, alone, into an unlit basement. There was no good reason for the detective to expose himself to such danger, other than to establish this movie firmly in the category of "thriller."<br /><br />I was also disappointed that there was no commentary on this DVD version. It would have been interesting to know some more of the facts about the actual investigation, so I suggest you obtain a full Director's copy of this film.<br /><br />But the film's score largely makes up for any lapses. Its haunting, taunting theme song, "Hurdy-Gurdy Man," truly captures the likely psychological state of the serial killer.</p></body></html>

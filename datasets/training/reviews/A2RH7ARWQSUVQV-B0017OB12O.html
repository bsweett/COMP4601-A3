<meta name="summary" content="" I Hate the British!!!""></head><body><p>Col. Saito, commandant of the work camp in the Burmese jungle, doesn't particularly like the English.  According to him, they have dishonored themselves by surrendering,  "I hate the British!" he screams.<br /><br />Saito hates them but finds himself in the difficult and humiliating position of needing the stiff-necked Colonel Nicholson's assistance to build his train track and his bridge.  He threatens and tries to break Nicholson, all to no available.  Nicholson would literally prefer death to compromising on his principles.  His principles?  That officers not work along with enlisted personnel.  Officers are for leadership and command not menial labor.<br /><br />Without Nicholson's cooperation, Saito will fail, his bridge will not be built and he will be obliged to commit suicide.  Saito blinks and gives Nicholson what he demands.  Nicholson and many of his officers and men--in an effort to maintain discipline and purpose--throw themselves fully into the project and build a bridge far better than the Japanese ever would have.  Nicholson has, in fact, become an unwitting collaborator with the Japanese.  Nicholson is a heroic figure but his courage doesn't mitigate the fact that he is helping the enemy.<br /><br />'Bridge on the River Kwai' is a terrific film.  It was adapted from the book by Pierre Boulle...a man who, himself, wasn't in love with the British...as a matter of fact, he may have detested the Brits as much as his character, Saito.  To Boulle, Nicholson is the archetypal British colonial officer, brave, stubborn and arrogant in equal measure.  His attitudes are those of colonialism...the White Man's Burden and all that.  This is not the way Lean formats this film but, nevertheless, both the book and movie are terrific.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, author of novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico</p></body></html>

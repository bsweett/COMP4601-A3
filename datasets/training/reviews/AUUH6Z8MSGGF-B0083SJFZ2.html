<meta name="summary" content="Clash of the Titans looks amazing but story trimmed too far"></head><body><p><span class="tiny"> Length:: 8:16 Mins<br /><br /></span>The remake of the 1981 classic, "Clash of the Titans" was directed by Louis Leterrier, director of "Transporter 2" and "The Incredible Hulk" (the Edward Norton one). It stars Sam Worthington as Perseus, son of Zeus (Liam Neeson) whose entire human family has been killed by Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and with the help of Io (Gemma Arterton) he is seeking his revenge and attempting to save Argos and the Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalvos).<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Special Features:<br /><br />The Blu-Ray edition is the best way to experience this epic movie heavily based in green screen CGI technology. The most amazing aspect is a feature I've never seen before but think should be in ALL Blu-Ray movies is the Maximum Movie Mode which is a complex picture-in-picture way of watching the film where it will zoom out from the movie itself and put it aside where you can still see it while bringing up another box with scene breakdowns, effects breakdowns, and on-the-spot vignettes all the while you are watching the movie! For example, in one of the beginning scenes you are watching Perseus and his father talking on the fishing boat and at the same time you can see how the boat was built, complications the crew faced in getting it to work, and other behind the scenes moments.<br /><br />Many of my main complaints about the film are recognized in deleted scenes and the alternate ending. For example, I disliked how after all the set-up for Perseus not wanting the gods help that he just got this easy going peace with Zeus at the end. The alternate ending was preferable for me because Perseus goes all the way up to Mount Olympus on his Pegasus to face Zeus in a manly way shrugging him off once and for all. My biggest problem with the movie was that we only focused on two of the gods: Zeus and Hades while all the others stood around and never got to talk. In the deleted scenes, you will find much more character development and dialogue from all the other gods getting involved, having opinions on Zeus's actions, and even one going down to Earth to talk to Perseus and give him the gold coin. At some point in the process, a decision was made to go in the other direction but I think the original idea of having all the others involved was a stronger choice. Another nice thing about getting to see these deleted scenes that aren't completely up to par with the special effects is that you get a chance to admire the shiny, metallic costumes the gods wear that you can barely see with all the glowy effects bling added post production during the film.<br /><br />Another feature praises Sam Worthington as being an "action hero for the ages" mainly highlighting his willingness to do his own stunt work as much as possible. There are many small featurettes on individual aspects of production, but the best way to get that full experience I think is to watch that Maximum Movie Mode which is very thorough and if there's a boring moment, you have the option of going back to watching the movie and ignoring it. Choices are great!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Trying so hard to be noir that it forgot to be a good movie"></head><body><p>In the interest of full disclosure, I have never been a Brian DePalma fan.  I have always considered DePalma to be very much a "style over substance" director.  I have also not read Ellroy's novel, so I cannot speak to the faithfulness of the adaptation.  With all of this in mind, this is not a movie which I normally would have seen, but the impassioned advocacy of a few fervent Amazon reviewers persuaded me to ignore the multitudes of people who bashed this movie, and give it a try.<br /><br />To be fair, it isn't as bad a movie as some have said, but it can see bad from where it's standing.  Also, the point that this is a roughly 3-hour movie edited down to 2 hours is a point well taken, but I would point out that DePalma surely must have known that there was no way he could get the studio's blessing for a 3-hour movie & should have proceeded accordingly.<br /><br />Nonetheless, one has to take the movie as it is, not for what it could have been.  As it is, there seem to be a nearly infinite number of plot lines, which meander around in search of a sustained narrative for 100 minutes, only to be frantically resolved by a series of monologues in the last 20 minutes...ie, "This is what I did, this is how I did it, and this is why I did it," repeated several times during the race to the finish.  The monologues are only slightly less goofy than most of the dialogue that is found throughout the movie.  Many of these characters seem to have a penchant for repeating themselves.  "How could this happen?  How could this happen?"<br /><br />Some of this might have been improved with better casting.  Aaron Eckhart's twitchy antics grow tiresome quickly and almost seem to border on caricature.  Josh Hartnett seems so impossibly bland that one has to wonder how he could possibly have made his character even remotely compelling.  As it is, he makes Bucky Bleichert dull & uninteresting, to the point that I really didn't care what happened to him towards the end.  Scarlett Johansson & Hilary Swank are adequate, but Johansson (whom I normally like) seemed uncomfortable in this role.  Other performances (in particular that of Fiona Shaw's) simply seemed cartoonish.<br /><br />Looming over all of this is Brian DePalma's determination to show us how great he is with the use of shadows, camera angles and the like, but he simply beats the viewer over the head with it.  Some people may not get the comparison, but it reminds me of how Leonard Bernstein used to conduct Mahler...it always seemed to be more about Lennie than about the music, and he was always trying to make the point of what a great Mahler interpreter he was rather than letting the music simply speak for itself.  So it is with this movie, where it almost seems as though DePalma is leaning over your shoulder, saying "OK, look at how I use the lighting and the backdrop here," and "Look at how I rotate the camera 180 degrees to create this transitional moment."  He is so preoccupied with making this movie as "noirish" as can be, that he forgot to make it sure that it was at least coherent.<br /><br />As I said earlier, not as bad as some might describe, but definitely not good at all.  I should have listened to the nay-saying multitudes after all.</p></body></html>

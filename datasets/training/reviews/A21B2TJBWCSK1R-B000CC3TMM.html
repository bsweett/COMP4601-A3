This is a question that is always asked of sequels because most movies don't need one. However, studios hungry for profits are always on the look out for a film franchise that they can exploit. The Transporter has such potential with each film being its own self-contained adventure complete with beautiful women, cool car chases and exciting fight sequences set in exotic locales.<br /><br />If you liked the original then it is pretty much guaranteed that you'll dig this one as it serves up more of the same only cranked up another notch: the car chases are more fantastical (thanks to CGI) and the bad guys more colourful (fellow Guy Ritchie alumni Jason Flemyng plays one of the baddies).<br /><br />The martial arts sequences were better in the first one (although, the fight scene where Frank takes on a bunch of thugs with a long metal pipe is very impressive) but the car chases in this movie are more impressive and greater in number. Even though Transporter 2 is slightly inferior to the original, it is still a very entertaining, highly enjoyable effort.<br /><br />There are 14 (?!) deleted and extended scenes that flesh out certain scenes including one where Frank and the boy's mother actually kiss. However, the real treat for fans are the extended versions of most of the fight scenes (which include added gore cut for the PG-13 rating) and car chases.<br /><br />Also included is a blooper reel, a making of featurette and one that focuses on the music.</p></body></html>

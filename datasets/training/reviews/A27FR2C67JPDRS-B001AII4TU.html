<meta name="summary" content="Third time, not quite the charm...but still fun!"></head><body><p>In a summer of threequels (Spidey 3, Shrek 3, and Pirates 3), everyone's favorite green orge returns, complete with his true love, Fiona, and his sidekicks, Donkey and Puss in Boots.  The Shrek franchise is a popular series of films (and a definite money maker) and this film should continue that trend.  However, this film is not quite up to par with its predecessors.<br /><br />The story begins in Far Far Away Land where Fiona's father dies, but not before asking Shrek to step into his royal shoes and rule the kingdom.  Shrek is none-to-happy to fulfill the dying wishes of his dead father-in-law and decides to seek out another heir to the throne who the dying monarch mentions before he croaks...pun intended!<br /><br />With Shrek off on an adventure to find the heir, who turns out to be Arthur or "Artie" (King Arthur and played rather dimly by Justin Timberlake), the scheming Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) returns with an army of fairy tale villains determined to steal the throne and banish his green rival once and for all.<br /><br />The story this time around seems to take a little longer to get rolling and doesn't quite have the charm of the first two films.  The film does have its moments and I did love the fact that this movie empowers the fairy tale heroines (played by the wickedly talented, Mya Rudolph, Amy Sedaris, Cheri Oteri and Amy Pohler) who are normally relegated to being saved by a handsome and heroic prince.  This time the girls including Cinderella, Snow White, Sleepy Beauty and Fiona rush to the rescue of the men and give the twisted fairy tale a "girl power" makeover!  Another charming aspect of the film is that we get to see Shrek as a daddy, which provides an upbeat and endearing ending to the film.  One thing that did bother me a little is Donkey and Puss switching bodies after a magic spell goes wrong.  It was a funny bit but after a while it was a little disconcerting to hear the voice of Antonio Banderas coming out of donkey's mouth and Eddie Murphy's coming out of Puss' mouth.  And, as far as Timberlake voicing Arthur, I wasn't all that impressed.  If he were replaced in the fourth film, it really wouldn't bother me at all.<br /><br />But if you are a Shrek fan, I think you will enjoy the film.  It does have some funny moments and the animation, as usual, is beautiful.  A good addition to the Shrek franchise.</p></body></html>

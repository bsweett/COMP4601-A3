I only rented it out really because I thought it actually was the female version of Rocky, and for awhile it seemed to be that way. Poor fighter, crusty old manager, the works you know. And I loved Rocky so I thought, why not give it a shot, see how well it is. It looked interesting and I assumed maybe the critics actually picked out a good movie this time.<br /><br />Critics and I have always been on different wavelengths though on what is good and what is mediocre or trash. I hardly ever agree with other critics, but I always give them a shot with the movies they praise. Sometimes they're right, sometimes I think they are wrong. On this film I think it was too highly praised. Everyone was saying it was amazing and just so heart- jerking. I disagree. It was not amazing, matter of fact, if it wasn't for two major actors playing in the film (Clint, Morgan) then I doubt this film would have been as praised as it has. To me, if I looked to the actors as just actors I just saw normal acting, nothing amazing. And the plot itself held good ground, being somewhat like Rocky but putting in its own difference, like when Clint hints at problems with his daughter- although you never figure out unfortunately why his daughter and him are not speaking with each other. But especially when Maggie falls and falls hard is the major difference.<br /><br />The major disappoinment though in this film was not the highly applauded acting being just nothing special to me, but the ending itself. Maggie came in this film strong and determined to fight anything and anyone to be a great boxer. I believed in her strength, I believed she believed she could do anything, that's when I liked the movie a lot was seeing the determination of Maggie around Clint's gym, punching that bag all that time. Then something happens in the end, and it was terrible I can tell you that much, and suddenly Maggie just didn't have the fight in her anymore. That was the greatest disappointment of the film. I don't know, maybe others thought that was the most powerful point, when Maggie loses her will that she had so strongly in the beginning, but I thought it was just down right miserable and a bleak ending. I know that they were really trying to make it a tear jerker and the ending was supposed to be miserable but I just did not like that ending at all. I expected from all of Maggie's will in the beginning that she wouldn't have fallen all the way down, but she did, and it was just greatly disappointing that's all.<br /><br />Others, many others, will say this movie was great, but I would say in my personal opinion that this movie was not great, but just average. It was a good plot, with average acting, and a disappointing and miserable ending where the lead character named Maggie totally lets you down in the end. You can sympathize with her definitely, but the point was after you see her in the beginning, you expected her to be so much more stronger. Maggie said something in the beginning of the movie that I totally ignored, but now, I know was the most strongest quote in the whole film. Listen to her carefully in the beginning, and hear her hint at the ending of the film in one single sentence.</p></body></html>

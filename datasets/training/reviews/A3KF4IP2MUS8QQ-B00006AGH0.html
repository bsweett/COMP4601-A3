I should point out that I came into this film with no preconceptions; I have not read any of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan novels, nor have I seen any of the earlier movies starring Harrison Ford in the central role.  I can certainly see how major and strange a transition it must be for fans to go from the older Ford to the young Affleck, and the obvious disparity between the film and the book that inspired it would also probably bother me had I previously read Clancy's 1991 novel.  I was attracted to this movie for two reasons: one is the plot.  Delaying the release of this film in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attack was the right thing to do, given the subject matter dealt with here, but it also served to pique my interests in the film.  As an old and unrepentant Cold Warrior now viewing the world through eyes permanently rimmed red by the reprehensible actions of cowardly terrorists, the idea of an American-Russian nuclear war brought about by the maneuvering of terrorists definitely spoke to me.  The other aspect of the film that appealed to me was the prominent role played by Morgan Freeman.  I've said it before, and I'm sure I'll say it again: in my opinion, Morgan Freeman is the greatest actor working today.<p>The complex yet tightly-wound plot of this film is impressive.  The sudden death of a Soviet (now Russian) leader still carries with it a significant amount of trepidation in the West, but this film takes such fears to an unprecedented level.  The characterization of Russian President Nemerov is, I think, the most crucial element of this entire plot, and it comes off magnificently.  Talk about being boxed in against a wall.  Try being a new Russian leader already regarded as a hard-liner by basically everyone in the West (except for CIA analyst Jack Ryan) and then have forces that should be under your control but are not attack Grozny, Chechnya, with horrible chemical weapons.  No Russian President can admit less than total control of his military.  Then have a nuclear bomb go off in a major American city, a tragedy made to look rather convincingly as an act of Russian aggression.  Americans are going to respond to such an attack with extreme prejudice.  Thus, before you have your new Presidential chair adequately adjusted for your comfort, you're on the brink of nuclear war.  Ciaran Hinds deserves all the credit I can give him for his convincing performance as President Nemerov; he (not Affleck, and not even Freeman) makes this motion picture the overwhelming success I think it is.  <p>The entire cast of this film is excellent (even Affleck), and so is the production value of everything you see.  The special effects are impressive (and it was a treat to see just how they were brought to life in the DVD special features dealing with the visual effects), but these are just the trimmings on the real feast.  The meat of The Sum of All Fears is a plot which is compelling, believable, disquieting, and, in the end, rather moving.  This movie drew me in completely to its world of intelligence, espionage, deception, politics, and diplomacy, and I could not possibly give it less than five stars.</p></body></html>

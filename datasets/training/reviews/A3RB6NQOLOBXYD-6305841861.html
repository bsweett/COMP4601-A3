<meta name="summary" content="I know double dips make people angry...but there is an exception to this one!"></head><body><p>Honestly I don't seem why most people are upset about this double dip. Anchor Bay only released this dvd once, Twice if you count the Limited Tin edition but thats pretty much the same exact dvd. I could understand if Anchor Bay was releasing another army of darkness or the first evil dead because they have close to 7 different releases of each. Besides the cool art work... for the evil dead 2 book of the dead were getting a DiviMax transfer which it really needed anyway. The Current Evil dead 2 dvd is pretty grainy and needs some work. on top of that we are getting more current and better special features as well. So honestly i don't mind shelling out another 30 bucks to see a cult classic in a new transfer. I bought the original evil dead twice on dvd and it was worth the upgrade, this book of the dead should be eveb better!!!!!!!</p></body></html>

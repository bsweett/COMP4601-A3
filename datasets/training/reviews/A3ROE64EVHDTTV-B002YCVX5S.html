<meta name="summary" content=""We in the killin' Nazi business. And cousin, business is a-boomin'!""></head><body><p>Blu-Ray Review<br />Movie:  4.5/5  Video Quality:  5/5  Audio Quality:  5/5  Extras:  4/5  Overall:  4.6/5 (rounded up in total star ranking)<br /><br />Anybody remember that Italian war movie from the 70s with Bo Svenson and Fred Williamson? They had ridiculously over-the-top shoot-outs and naked Nazi women firing machine guns! Anyone? No?<br /><br />Well, Quentin Tarantino has taken the theme and topic of that silly film and turned it into something of his own. "Inglourious Basterds" doesn't quite have as much Nazi-killing as I expected, but it excels brilliantly with its plot, story, characters, dialogue, acting, cameramanship, and music selection. It is a bit strange perhaps, with some absurdity, but it is all earnest, original, and of decent quality. There are a couple of bloody brutal parts, but it's never over-done. There are some funny parts too, but it's also never over-done. Additionally, the movie has some interesting cultural/historical references and homages. Most of it even serves as a film about film and filmmaking, as the plot has a lot to do with a cinema. If you liked Tarantino's other work (especially "Pulp Fiction," which has a plot structure similar to "Inglourious Basterds") or it you want to see a war drama of a different nature, check this one out by all means.<br /><br />The disc has superb quality. The video looks incredibly sharp, clean, clear, and vivid; I saw no problems worth mentioning. Sound quality is excellent (DTS-HD MA 5.1). It includes numerous extras, and a digital copy. Comes with a slipcover.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Other reasons to watch than 'Che Becoming Che'"></head><body><p>'Motorcycles Diaries' depicts the now-legendary pan-suramericana trip of Ernesto Guevera and Alberto Granado as the turning point of young Che's life...sort of the "how Che became Che."  I'll let others debate whether or not the legend of Che is worthy of burnishment.  For me, the best things about the film - and what makes it a must-see - are (in order):<br /><br />1. Eric Gautier's amazing cinematography.  It truly captures the beauty of South America.  A Colombian friend of my wife's exclaimed "NOW, you see why I miss my country!"<br /><br />2. The closing credits - it's stunning to see the real life Alberto Granado suddenly standing in front of you; and it's equally spine-tingling - indeed, jaw-dropping - to see the real Santiago newspaper article about the Guevara/Granado trip as well as the photo of the two travelers paddling down the Amazon on their 'Mambo-Tango' raft.<br /><br />3. Rodrigo de la Serna - Gael Garcia Bernal is the 'name' actor here, but the Porte&ntilde;o de la Serna (as Granado) steals the movie out from under his nose.  I was shouting "Fuser!" for days.<br /><br />4. The Leper Colony scenes - the height of the 'Che becoming Che' metamorphosis happens here.  It's a brilliant stretch of movie-making by Walter Salles.</p></body></html>

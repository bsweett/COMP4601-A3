<meta name="summary" content=""Pretty Good Comic Book Film!""></head><body><p>Chris Evans, Hugo Weaving, Tommy Lee Jones and Hayley<br />Atwell star in this 2011 action film based on the marvel<br />comics. A young soldier becomes a symbol for freedom<br />and faces an evil German leader. Chris is great in this,<br />it's nice to see him as another superhero and Hugo is<br />always a good villain. This dvd has nice picture and<br />sound plus some neat extras. This is a pretty good<br />comic book film I recommend.</p></body></html>

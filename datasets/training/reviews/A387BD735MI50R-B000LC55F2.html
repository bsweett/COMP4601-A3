It's now here - now there - now somewhere else.<br /><br />Some of this technique may have been a purposeful attempt to present the viewer with a parallel to the magician's trick of now-you-see-it, now-you-don't - no, the coin isn't in my hand, it's behind your ear! But this movie goes too far with that sort of disjunction. It ends up like a jigsaw puzzle spilled out of the box onto the floor. There's no process or coherent character development here. So it's hard to get emotionally involved with the lives of the competing magicians.<br /><br />Admittedly, "The Prestige" has a lot of ground to cover. There are a lot of tricks and counter-tricks to present, a lot of deals and deles. To get all this material in and to retain some sense of the journey as well as the destination, the movie would have to have been much longer, something that many directors/producers presume current audiences won't tolerate.<br /><br />I had at least looked forward to seeing how the famous real-life wizard, Nikola Tesla, was portrayed here. However, I was somewhat disappointed on this score too. As fantastic as many of Tesla's experiments with electricity actually were, his results are carried to absurd extremes for the purposes of this plot. The movie veers off into sheer implausible science fiction when it comes to Tesla.<br /><br />Also, there is something a little jarring about Christian Bale in the role of one of the competing magicians. One expects a magician of that sort to be gaunt, angular, satanically shadowed - and Bale appears a little plump for this stereotype. Or maybe it is just that Bale had taken himself down to such extreme emaciation for his haunting portrayal in "The Machinist," that his fleshed-out appearance here clashed with expectation.<br /><br />But the movie does have an intricate plot with some challenging twists and turns.<br /><br />"The Illusionist," was a movie that came out at roughly the same time as this "Prestige" and had a similar theme of pre-modern magicians. "The Illusionist" had what was perhaps a slightly more predictable denouement. But it was more satisfying in that it took its time with texture and unfolding. If these two movies could have been combined somehow, with the cagey plot of "The Prestige," and the sipping amber loveliness of "The Illusionist," we would have had one magical movie.</p></body></html>

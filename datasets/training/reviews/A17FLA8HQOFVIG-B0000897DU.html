<meta name="summary" content="Now I understand what rap music is all about.  Great film!"></head><body><p>I didn't expect to like this 2002 film.  After all, I'm a 64-year-old woman and I don't know or care about rap music.  I am so unacquainted with the star, &quot;Eminem&quot; that I've just learned he doesn't spell his name &quot;M&amp;M&quot;.  But because this film has gotten so much attention, I  thought it would be good for me to check out what for me is a culture stranger than that depicted in the foreign films that I watch all the time.<p>The story is supposedly a fictionalized version of Eminem's own roots.  It's set in Detroit, where &quot;8 Mile&quot; is the area that separates the black and white neighborhoods.  The character Eminem plays is named &quot;Rabbit&quot; and he grows up in a trailer park with his mother, played by Kim Bassinger, who is excellent in the role.  His little sister is exposed to his mother's numerous boyfriends and it is with this little girl that Rabbit shows the most tenderness.  Rabbit works in a car plant but his whole life is about rap music and he hangs out with a group of both African American and white friends who feel the same way.<p>There are scenes in the film which show what rap is all about.  It's not about the big money and the trashy lyrics.  Instead, it's about disadvantaged people who communicate the frustrations of their lives.  Much of it is spontaneous.  And much of it is competitive, where insults fly and there's always a battle to see who will win over the audience.  And an audience can be bystanders by a lunch wagon as well as in a club.<p>I liked the part that Eminem played.  He comes across as real.  He wears a wool cap through much of the film, making his skin look very pale and his light eyes defiant. He shows vulnerability as well as strength and I rooted for him throughout.  This was not surprising because the film has a good script and is well paced with plenty of confrontations and tension.  What surprised me is how much I enjoyed the rap music.  It's all about words and being creative.  And doing it to a rhythm.  At first it was a little hard to understand.  But by the end of the film I was completely won over to rap as an art form.<p>I loved &quot;8 Mile&quot; and highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A moody knockout of a crime drama"></head><body><p>The exquisite Bay Area newspaper publicity ad for David Fincher's ZODIAC is in full color and shows the Golden Gate Bridge enshrouded in fog late at night and a figure standing where the "I" should be.  It is taken from an unusual angle, the northeast corner of Marin County from a low angle, not the northwest headlands.  And there is an existential caption:  "There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer."  The movie is an intelligent and suspenseful--and surprisingly bloodless, given the material and the director of "SE7EN"--crime drama about the hunt for the serial killer known as "The Zodiac".  He terrorized the Bay Area from the late 1960's to the early 1980's, my college years, so this is a subject I know and feel passionate about.<br /><br />Instead of a routine police investigation without a satisfying ending, our three protagonists--brilliantly played by Robert Downey, Jr., Jake Gyllenhaal, and Mark Ruffalo--are an ace SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE reporter named Paul Avery (Downey), CHRONICLE political cartoonist and cryptogram expert Robert Graysmith (Gyllenhaal), and homicide inspector Dave Toschi (Ruffalo).  The movie has been magnificently adapted by James Vanderbilt from two non-fiction books by Graysmith.  They play off each other perfectly.  Avery is an alcoholic chain-smoker, ideal for Downey.  Graysmith is literary, a non-smoker, and insistent on following up every last lead in the still-unsolved case.  And Toschi fights with his police superiors on crime county jurisdiction matters.  Like Graysmith, he is determined to find the killer.  Vanderbilt even finds a way to turn a minus into a plus with the still-unsolved crimes, by creating a movie about obsessed characters who are finally unable to wrap up their obsession neatly; the movie is spellbinding and haunting.<br /><br />I was afraid to see ZODIAC until I saw the beautiful publicity ad--I've seen movies for much worse reasons!--and the rave reviews from East Coast reviewers and national magazine critics.  But I still feared a bloodbath.  Fincher (FIGHT GAME, PANIC ROOM) surprised me as the director.  He shows a couple in a 1969 lover's lane being shot to death repeatedly (the guy in the car survived somehow) and a savage knife attack with another couple by a lake (Berryessa?).  And a cab driver in nighttime San Francisco is killed with just gun shots heard on the sound track.  Those are still the only five crimes actually pinned on the Zodiac Killer and the only ones depicted in the movie.  Everything else is talked and argued about in the CHRONICLE newsroom and police stations all over the Bay Area.  The last scene of BONNIE AND CLYDE (1967) has more blood than all of ZODIAC.<br /><br />Everyone really did their homework here.  There must be one hundred technical consultants and advisors on the end credits, representing seemingly every single county in the Bay Area, plus a few in Southern California as leads are followed up there.  Avery is now dead from his endless cigarettes and alcohol, but Graysmark was a technical advisor who, I believe, still lives in San Francisco.  (The final credit narrative crawl went by way too quickly for me.)  The editing is so tight and suspenseful, even at a long 158 minutes, that I could not find a single place to go out to the bathroom in the middle; so do that and get refreshments before you go into the theatre.  The production design captures my college years in both the Bay Area and Southern California to perfection, and David Shire's music score is appropriately brooding and mysterious.<br /><br />But more than anything else, ZODIAC is a powerful and flawless crime drama because of director David Fincher's artistry.  I have only seen his serial killer drama, SE7EN, which was a dark and powerful bloodbath; I should rent his PANIC ROOM and FIGHT CLUB.  ZODIAC seems like his crowning achievement, a work of art with a lingering impact long after you leave the theater.  It is in CinemaScope--my blasted CineMark  projection was wide enough for 2.35, but repeatedly cropped out  the extensive date and place captions at the bottom of the screen on a $7.00 matinee. The movie should play unnervingly well in a night bedroom on home video.  Perhaps even better.  Maybe you should wait--and get informative Zodiac Killer bonuses on DVD?--unless you have a theatre complex you know to be professional.  Century Plaza 10 in South San Francisco is a disgrace.  For the price of a couple going at night for $10 each, you could buy the movie on DVD in six months, a most sobering thought.</p></body></html>

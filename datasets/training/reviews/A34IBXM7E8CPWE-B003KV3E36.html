I wanted a knife with a compass so bad after seeing "First Blood" I could hardly see straight!! But I have to admit when I first heard that Stallone was going to milk the Rambo teet for another film, I had serious reservations. But I guess having Rambo help create the Taliban in Part III isn't the best way for one of America's heroes to go down in cinematic history.<br /><br />I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed "Rambo", it's a violent gore-fest which tries to cram in message about fighting for "something" in it's 80 minute run time. The basic story is you get some bible-thumpers who want to spread medecine and "the word" to the poor folks in war-torn Burma, and they want Rambo to guide them upriver into this stinking hell-hole. Well you know whats going to happen from the first moment Rambo leaves these do-gooders alone, but how it happens is a whole other matter. When the bad guys make an entrance.....they make an entrance. People getting blown up left and right, ripped to pieces by machine gun fire..and it's not like the old "Rambo" flicks where somebody would get shot and fall down, when someone gets shot here you see limbs come flying off, guts come pouring out, heads explode...it's some of the greatest gore effects this side of the "Saw" films. Seriously it's like "Rambo" meets "Cannibal Holocaust".<br /><br />Of course the main reason to see a Rambo film is to watch Rambo get his revenge. And this he does, and in true gruesome fashion. More limbs go flying and more noggins erupt in blood spouts, and of course Rambo puts his hunting knife and bow to great use.<br /><br />So, is "Rambo" a good film? I enjoyed it. But then, I love horror films so splatter doesn't really bother me too much. (If anything I kept thinking that whoever did these special effects really needs to be hired for the next "Friday the 13th" flick!). If you are squeamish, then this probably isn't the flick for you. If you are looking for the rah-rah go America Rambo of the 80's, you'll probably be disappointed as well, as Rambo himself makes it clear he isn't fighting for country or god..he's just fighting for himself. Also, if you are looking for Rambo to be a one-man extermination squad, you'll probably be disappointed as well. This film is more like "Team Rambo" with several mercenaries thrown in to help Rambo out. But if you don't mind the blood, and just want to watch Rambo kick some butt, then you will enjoy this flick.</p></body></html>

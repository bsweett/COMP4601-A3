<meta name="summary" content="An Epic Film with a Heart"></head><body><p>KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is not just another Hollywood epic with a cast of thousands laying pillage to the earth and fellow man.  Yes, it is a mammoth production with enough spectacular sets, battle scenes, violence and atmosphere to satisfy even the most ravenous Big Picture appetite. But is also has a fine script (written by William Monahan) that elects to focus on a rather intimate series of stories that have sensitivity and tenderness and, perhaps more importantly, offers some historical background for understanding the ongoing battles over the city of Jerusalem.<br /><br />Balian (Orlando Bloom) is a recently widowed blacksmith in France in the 12th century whose long absent nobleman father Godfrey surprisingly informs him that Balian is his son and pleads with him to accompany him to Jerusalem for the Crusades, a challenge Balian slowly accepts.  Godfrey is killed in battle but manages to bestow his knighthood on Balian before he dies, leaving Balian to assume the important role of humanist in the multifaceted struggle for power that exists in Jerusalem.  King Baldwin of Jerusalem (Edward Norton) lives a holy life hiding his leprosy behind a mask and bids Balian to protect the people of the city of Jerusalem against not only the evil undermining of the Knights Templar led by Reynald (Brendan Gleeson) and the incipient King of Jerusalem Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas), but also against the Saracens led by Saladin (Ghassan Massoud). Balian  is assisted by mentor Tiberias (Jeremy Irons) and by his innocent love for Sybilla (Eva Green) who unfortunately is the wife of Guy! Balian remains true to his ideals of knighthood.<br /><br />The military logistics of the various battles are a bit confusing to follow as the variation in uniforms is minimal.  But it is Balian's ever-present protection of the people of Jerusalem that leads to the historical moment that ends the siege of the city well described in history books.  The film ends in a manner that emphasizes the importance of humanity over greed, lust, war, and destruction and opens the path for compassion for the centuries long schism that still afflicts the holy city.<br /><br />The cast is excellent with small roles made large by such fine actors as Michael Sheen, David Thwelis, Velibor Topic, among others. The musical score is a magnificent blend of Western ecclesiastic themes (including Bach!) with  Eastern ones under the writing direction of Harry Gregson-Williams. John Mathieson is responsible for the vivid cinematography.  But major kudos go to Ridley Scott for making what could have been a loud blood and guts period piece into a film with a quiet heart and soul. KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is an inspiring  film to see.

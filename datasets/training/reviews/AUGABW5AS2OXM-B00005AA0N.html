George C Scott did an outstanding job of portraying the legendary general George Patton. This movie does an excellent job of showing World War II. This movie also shows General George Patton and his ups and downs during World War II. This movie was an outstanding historical depiction of the war as well. This was a well done movie that won several Oscars because of it's quality. George C. Scott never played a better role in his whole career. Watch this movie and you will keep on watching it. I have seen it for the 75th time and it is still good. This is a must buy.</p></body></html>

Like the late Stanley Kubrick, he moves away from standard Hollywood material, and creates a style of his own. What we see in his films are brief narratives by different characters, beautiful shots of natural scenery, and some moments that place no insight on sound (we just see the beauty of the surroundings, and the only sound we hear is either the breeze or distant animals). If you've seen The Thin Red Line (one of my favorite films), then you know what I'm talking about. Like his other films, this one delves into the meaning of life, love, war, hate, violence, etc. But now, in the new millennium, we have seen something different from Malick. The New World is yet another beautiful film by the master filmmaker, and like his other films, it relies on history when telling the story. Here we have the creation of Jamestown, Virginia, and the bond between John Smith and Pocahontas. While it isn't entirely historically accurate, it does borrow certain elements from popular American folklore respectively.<br /><br />It's 1607, and the English set out to found the land of North America. After setting foot on the land, Captain John Smith is captured by a tribe of Native Americans, and is about to be executed. However, one of the young women wants him alive, and he is now considered a prisoner. The woman turns out to be Pocahontas, and she and Smith fall in love. This rather complicates matters between the English and the Native Americans, and what follows is a breathtaking movement of beauty, mysticism, and new discoveries about life.<br /><br />Almost everything is what you would expect in a Malick film. Nature shots, voice-overs, philosophical implications, the works. From beginning to end, it is more of a spiritual experience rather than an entertaining one. But this probably wouldn't have fully succeeded if it weren't for the outstanding cast. Colin Farrell, Q'Orianka Kilcher, Christopher Plummer, Christian Bale, and Wes Studi make an interesting combination. Their performances are absolutely stunning (there is no melodrama in the way they interact with each other). Cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki is really a sight to see: the dark colors really add to the mystical atmosphere that is conveyed through this film. I wish I would say something special about James Horner's music, but most of it had been cut out and replaced by classical music. I guess I could say that Mozart's Piano Concerto and Wagner's Das Rheingold were unexpected but nonetheless pleasurable additions to the soundtrack.<br /><br />It's pretty obvious that this movie is not for everyone. Anyone who is looking for an exciting film might want to look elsewhere. This is a slow-moving, yet hauntingly effective motion picture which lacks nonstop action, witty dialogue, and softcore sex. I personally have come to admire it, despite the last thirty minutes of the film being a bit plodding at times. It's as great as The Thin Red Line, and I would happily recommend it to those who love to see some fine cinematic art.<br /><br />Grade: A-<br /><br />P.S.<br />People say that the extended cut is much better than the original 135-minute cut. If that's the case, then I might as well watch it and see for myself. Stay tuned.</p></body></html>

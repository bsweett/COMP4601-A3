<meta name="summary" content="Something went very wrong here."></head><body><p>Fascinating scenario, wonderful screenplay, some marvelous performances and beautiful to look at. So, why didn't I love this movie? I'm not certain. There was a sense of something &quot;false&quot; throughout every frame which I remain unable to put my finger on. This bothers me.<br /><br /> I hate to call something a turkey, but this movie - which seemingly has most of the elements of a great picture - fails to pull them together into a cohesive whole. Here, we must blame the director. There are, to be sure, some wonderfully riveting performances by an almost uniformly excellent cast, but these performances feel like they belong in another, more deserving, and ultimately better movie.</p></body></html>

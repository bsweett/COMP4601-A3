<meta name="summary" content="The Hangover Will Sober You Up To Laugh Over and Over"></head><body><p>In this reviewer's mind, had THE HANGOVER been cast with well established actors, it would not have worked out or have been as funny. We hadn't really seen these actors before, so the characters seemed 'real' at the time. Funny set-up, great dialogue line-per-line,  every situation hilarious,  and to reiterate, great characters all around right down to even the wedding singer near the end of the film. An instant classic. One would beg the question, "Hasn't this been done before?" Yes, (i.e. the terrible VERY BAD THINGS) but [they] perfected it on this one.  Great support work all around from Mike Tyson (?) to veteran character actor Jeffrey Tambor as the understanding soon to be father-in-law. Hilarious!</p></body></html>

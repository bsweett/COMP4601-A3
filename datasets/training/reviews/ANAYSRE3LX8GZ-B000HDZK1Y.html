<meta name="summary" content="A comedy? Well, wheres the funny bits?"></head><body><p>When I first heard of it the plot of a fryer wrestler sounded different to the other things being released lately, but I'm glad I waited till it was available to rent rather then have gone to see it at the theaters.<br /><br />Jack Black stars as a Fryer who is pretty much useless to the other priests of a small village somewhere in Mexico. He yearns to hear people chant his name in vanity and learns about a wrestling tournament where the winners receive 200 bucks. He finds himself a sidekick and enters the tournament and loses, but receives enough money top help support the orfens he takes care of at the monastery. Any way a plot develops, he can't let his brothers know he's a wrestler cause its a sin blah blah blah<br /><br />he starts a battle with some golden masked guy that wasn't done right, I just did not care less if he beat him or not. The poor attempt at a love story between a fryer and a nun was pathetic. The wrestling itself is pretty poor, the opening match is not bad, but the rest of it is CGI and wire work, pretty sad when comparing it to what luchiodooirs really can do... only about two decent scene's of wrestling in the start, and then next to nothing later on. It's pretty obvious Jack Black didn't do any of the wrestling stunts, hence the use of a mask.<br /><br />In the end, i thought, "man that was s###" you didn't believe in the character, you didn't care if he won, the love story was not needed or needed to be extended more, the whole "do it for them" thing didn't make you feel a thing. And worst of all... where is the comedy? I saw a few pathetic attempts, but come on, what can you remember that was funny in this? There was no comedy and they tried to add fart sounds in here and there to make it funnier, but, they failed, a fart can be hilarious if done right, but this movie failed at it, it was just sounds thrown in for the hell of it.</p></body></html>

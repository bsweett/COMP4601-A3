<meta name="summary" content="Beat The "Devil""></head><body><p>At age 83, Sidney Lumet proves all the nay-sayers wrong who argue with age comes a loss of talent. "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is one of Lumet's best films.<br /><br /> Two brothers, Hank (Ethan Hawke) and Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) decide to rob a jewelry store. Their motives are admittedly cliche. Hank is divorced and behind on his child support. Andy has to maintain a certain lifestyle for his wife (Marisa Tomei). Both of whom claim to only be happy and at peace when on vacation in Brazil.<br /><br /> Still despite this cliche idea; one last heist will set us free, Lumet makes sure nothing else is predictable, from whose jewelry store is robbed to the film's climax. In fact that's what hurts the film a little. It has some moments which seem unreal, not believeable. But because the film is directed by Lumet I trust his instincts and feel he won't let the film get carried away with itself. He'll somehow make it all believeable. And to a very large extent, he does!<br /><br /> The relationship between the brothers and their relationship with their father feels true. I almost wish the film had spent more time on the relationship between Andy and his father, Charles (Albert Finney). Andy is the older brother, the leader. He is the emotionally strong one whereas Hank is a baby, both in birth order and maturity. Hank is weak and dependent on his brother. Yet Andy has his weak moments as well. He has an emotionally distant relationship with his father. There is one powerful scene where each man apologizes for not being what the other wanted.<br /><br /> Hoffman has had a strong year, appearing in three heavily favored films; "The Savages" and "Charlie Wilson's War" but it is his work here which truly touched me. I felt for his character. It is an emotionally complex, roller-coaster character and in my opinion a disgrace he didn't receive an Oscar nomination for his performance here. I know everyone and their brother agrees Daniel Day-Lewis will win for "There Will Be Blood (and his performance does make that film) but Hoffman's performance got to me more. Personally it is my favorite performance of the year because I can relate to this character.<br /><br /> But it is not just Hoffman who I feel was wrongly snubbed . Hawke is convincing in his role as is Finney. And where's Lumet's nomination for directing? He orchestrates the film wonderfully. There are certain editing choices I didn't like, the film is told out of sequence, but, he brings out some great performances from his actors. You have to give him credit for that.<br /><br /> "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" was the most draining experience I had at the movies. To call the film a downer is to understate the film. It is unrelenting in its intensity. It just brings you down. But that is not a fault because Lumet remains consistent with the tone. And because of that it is fittingly paced. We slowly become more and more absorbed.<br /><br /> I mentioned the film becomes unbelieveable, but, I didn't reveal why I felt the climax is and who they rob. I did that on purpose. I don't think you should know. And if you do know in advance, don't blame me, it's not my fault. The movie works best when you know as little as possible about where the plot will take you. Like a good heist, it's the element of surprise that counts. *** 1\2 out of *****<br /><br /> Bottom-line: One of Sidney Lumet's best films despite some minor flaws. Effectively paced. Lumet gets some strong performances out of his actors.</p></body></html>

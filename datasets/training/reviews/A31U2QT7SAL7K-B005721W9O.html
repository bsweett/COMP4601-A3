With a witty script and a marvelous blend of adequate special effects and action, this film is a comedy with its tongue-in-cheek humor affectionately administered. Tim Allen is good as the parody of James T. Kirk while Siguorney Weaver provides "ample" support as a communications officer with limited skills. Allan Rickman does a fine job in the "Leonard Nimoy/Mr. Spock-role as the actor forever typecast as a result of his character's popularity. Darryl Mitchell as the "token" minority "speaks" for the underused talents of Star Trek vets Nichele Nichols and George Takai. Most of all, it is Sam Rockwell who really steals the show as a "bit player" who accidentally gets taken on an adventure of a lifetime. One does not have to be Trekker to appreciate this film and the outstanding effort on the part of the moviemakers to produce a comic gem. Beam me up for the sequel!</p></body></html>

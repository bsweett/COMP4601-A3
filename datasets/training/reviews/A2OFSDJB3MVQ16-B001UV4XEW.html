<meta name="summary" content="The best R-rated comedy since "Wedding Crashers""></head><body><p>I was reluctant to see this movie since I was indifferent to Todd Phillips previous comedy, "Old School", but I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself laughing at the antics and mishaps of these middle aged men who discover utter chaos when they find their Las Vegas hotel room ravaged and with wild animals. All the actors are fine but special mention should be made of Bradley Cooper formerly the swinest suitor of Rachel McAdams in "Wedding Crashers", who's superb here as the confused bachelor who's trying to make sense of the chaos. If you're depressed in these tough financial times--this comedy will bring you out of it.</p></body></html>

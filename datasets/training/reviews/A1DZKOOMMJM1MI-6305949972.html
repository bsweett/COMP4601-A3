<meta name="summary" content="Amazing DVD!"></head><body><p>... Tim Burton is now a favorite of mine. There is also a great making of and the deleted footages are so fun. Many more extra's also such as an art gallery with over 400 stills, and of course the commentary which I never bother to listen to on any DVD. Now the movie itself is brillaint. The animation is superb and the plot is just amazing. My only complaint being that at many points the film is lacking and just moves so slow, hence the missing star. Dont get me wrong, it is an enjoyable film and definitely one I watch over and over, but many scenes have some drab and boring music, that Im not sure of kids will enjoy. But the film is amazing and that is just one flaw. Its a must. This DVD is a MUST...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Enter the creepy-crawly world of the paranoid delusional! 4+1/2 stars****"></head><body><p>I saw Tracy Letts' play BUG on Broadway in 2004 and now the movie, and I must say that the film does an excellent job at conveying the extreme paranoid delusional episodes that the mentally ill experience.<br /><br />What starts off as a seemingly sweet off-kilter story about a struggling waitress names Agnes (Ashley Judd) and her love interest Peter (Michael Shannon, who played the same role in the Broadway play), veers rapidly down a winding road into the land of "what is real and what is not!"  Do they have bugs in their bloodstream? Agnes and Peter spiral downward into a dark and most bizarre world that borders between the comedic and the horrifically gruesome.Where the play could only allude to such things, director William Friedkin allows us to see and experience what Agnes and Peter honestly believe they see and feel! Just like the play, this film deliberatly places us between the world of paranoid delusion and what reality is (or at least you think it is) and never allows you to settle into either world comfortably! The film is an excellent brain-teaser and definitely geared to make the viewer think. It did so on Broadway and it still successfully does so here!<br /><br />The trailer for this film tends to make you believe that you will be seeing is a horror flick.You will and you won't!....such is the creepy-crawly world of the paranoid delusional!!!</p></body></html>

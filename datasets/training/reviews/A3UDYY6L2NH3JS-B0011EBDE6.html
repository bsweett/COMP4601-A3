<meta name="summary" content="Three brothers for a lot of fooling around"></head><body><p>A film that could have been a real discovery of India and Hinduism. Alas we are very far from that because of the absolutely egocentric and self-centered psychologically claustrophobic closing up of each one of the three brothers onto each one of themselves. They hate themselves and one another with the greatest amount of love and yet they can't stand one another. They are looking for their mother who disappeared before their father's funeral they had to bury alone. She took refuge in some kind of Christian nunnery in India and she just does not hear the voices from her sons or from the world or from even herself. She is entirely locked up in an supposedly altruistic dedication to the poor of India and does not see she is selfishly rejecting her own responsibilities towards her own children and family. The spiritual pilgrimage of these three brothers becomes a nightmare when they have to travel together in a deluxe first class sleeper compartment on an Indian train and can't stand their mutual guts. They will eventually get themselves kicked off the train. But we miss all the spirituality of this country, this subcontinent, not to speak of the Hindu religion that is reduced to a poor series of worn-out clich&eacute;s. So what's left when the Darjeeling tea has been brewed, poured and drunk except some water to be passed in a few hours? It does not even appeal us to go there and experience such situations. They definitely have it too easy, climbing to the top of some sacred rock. It should be hard and there should be several stages to be respected. The path to enlightenment is in eight stages, at least in my Buddhist line. Here we have one single race and some foolish clown faces and antics on the top. Could have been a lot better with a little bit of an effort.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></body></html>

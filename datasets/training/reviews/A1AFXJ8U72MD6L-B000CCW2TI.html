Eventually she gets on a red eye flight back to Miami, Florida.<br /><br />She meets a guy (played by Cillian Murphy) who seems all right at first but turns out to be a lot more than she bargained for and as you can imagine things go bad.<br /><br />I'm used to seeing McAdams in other genres but she does a good enough job here as the female heroine. There are some interesting and memorable sub characters in this film.<br />In fact, one could argue the characters are much more interesting than the actual plot.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy, who I remember mostly as "Scarecrow" in "Batman Begins", plays his usual nice mix of Mr. Nice Guy and "he seems creepy or off but you can't quite figure out why".<br /><br />The budget was $26M and it made over $95M at the Box Office. Directed by Wes Craven. Fanbois get in line. Teen Choice Awards awarded this particular picture as "Choice Thriller".<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C plus to B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus;<br />TENSION/THRILLER LEVEL: B minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B; WHEN WATCHED: early September 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B.</p></body></html>

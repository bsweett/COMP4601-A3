Yeah! Grab some popcorn and get ready for the Saturday night fights! This film wastes no time getting to the action and there is plenty of it. I'm a fan of both movie series and I must admit this is a guilty pleasure for me. The film is actually pretty good although it can be frustrating at times because a lot of the film is in very dark places, making it a chore to figure out what monster did what to whom! I understand that most Alien Predator films have this style, but this one is particularly dark. It's still a fun movie and worth seeing for fans. I watched the Unrated version which wasn't too hard core, but plenty of impalements to keep gore hounds happy. The single disc version doesn't have all that much in the way of extras. Some commentaries etc. No making of creature design...which would have been nice since you don't get any really good looks at these awesome monsters. I would have given this film a little better rating, if the film wasn't so dark and the extras were better. Too bad. :-(</p></body></html>

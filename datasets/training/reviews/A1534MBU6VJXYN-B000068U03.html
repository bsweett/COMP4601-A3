<meta name="summary" content="A Little Overrated, But Still Good"></head><body><p>When "Reservoir Dogs" was released 13 years ago, it was almost instantly hailed as a masterpiece and its director, an ex-video store clerk named Quentin Tarrentino, a genius. Well, to be honest. I think that's pushing it a little. I think "Reservoir Dogs" is truly a great film, but there are a few minor flaws that prevent it from being a masterpiece.<br /><br />For starters, you have to be very patient to sit through the whole film. In actuality, the film is only a little over an hour and a half, which really isn't that song (I've sat through "Scarface"), but the film is very slow moving, thus making it seem a lot longer. I think this is because the film was lacking the famous dialogue Tarrentino's films are known for, which helps the movies pick up the pace. Another thing is the violence. Granted, "Scarface" and "The Godfather" both had more violence, but this film, thought not as violent, takes it to extremes those films didn't dare reach. I myself don't mind the violence, and I think the infamous "EAR" scene is brilliant, but a lot of people may not be able to handle the violence.<br /><br />But looking pas these minor flaws you will find a great movie. A great cast was assembled for this film. Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi are the standout performers, but the rest of the cast is excellent. Michael Madsen is awesome in his role. His character pesrsonifies the term bad***. The late Lawrence Tierney is fatastic as Joe Cabot, and Chris Penn is wonderful as Nice Guy Eddie. Even Quentin joins in on the fun as Mr. Brown.<br /><br />The extras are fantastic. They alone are worth the dvd. Overall, "Reservior Dogs" isn't exactly the masterpiece everyone thinks it is, but it is still a darn good film. I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

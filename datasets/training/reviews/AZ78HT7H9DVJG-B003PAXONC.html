<meta name="summary" content="legendary...not"></head><body><p>Robert Neville (Smith) is a scientist who has trapped himself the quarantined city of New York, along with his dog.  He feels responsible for the outbreak of this particular virus that somewhat turns people into zombies.  (Think *28 Days (Weeks) Later* or *Resident Evil*)<br /><br />From time to time, Neville will trap himself a zombie and put the subject through a series of tests.  However, his tests are not successful.<br /><br />Well, that's pretty much it...until like the last half hour of the film.  That is a big disappointment for me.  I thought it was gonna be big like his other films, *Independence Day*, *Wild Wild West* and the like.  Not even close.<br /><br />If you wanna see it, don't expect much from it.  Do expect a lot of talking to oneself and mimicking of Shrek.</p></body></html>

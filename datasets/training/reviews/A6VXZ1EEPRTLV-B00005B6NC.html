<meta name="summary" content="We can't leave without saying goodnight..."></head><body><p>Pitch Black, director David Twohy's visually stimulating film, is a solid science fiction adventure, with an interesting cast, nasty aliens, and a pretty intelligent plot that holds together well for the most part.  <p>A crisis in space, as a meteor shower damages the hull of the merchant vessel "Hunter Gratzner".  Awakening from a sleep state, the occupants of the spacecraft find themselves sliding down into the atmosphere of a planet.  Quick actions by the Docking Pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell), saves the ship from burning up, but much of the ship's hull is torn away in a thrilling and violent crash landing on the planet's sandy surface.<p>A handful of survivors are left on the desertlike planet, which bathed by the light of three suns, shows few signs of active life.  Among the group are Johns (Cole Hauser), a bounty hunter, and his prisoner Riddick (Vin Diesel).  The group explores the planet, which shows traces of past habitation, but no human life is found.  Finding an abandoned camp, the survivors encounter a hoard of strange flying creatures hiding in one of the buildings.  After the creatures kill a young boy, a further search reveals a cavern full of old human bones.  <p>The survivors discover that an eclipse will soon plunge the planet into "pitch black" darkness.  The darkness will trigger the appearance of the flying aliens, who repelled by the light of the planetary system's three suns, remain hidden underground.  Thus begins a race for survival, as the group must salvage supplies, repair an existing ship, and escape from the planet.<p>The special effects are very good.  The scene where a multitude of flying creatures fill the sky is impressive, as is the scene where one of the survivors is dismembered and ripped to pieces.  The aliens themselves are unusual looking and quite fierce.  Unlike "Aliens", Pitch Black is not a straightforward shoot em up battle between the creatures and man.  Instead other subplots are explored.  The basic conflict between Riddick and Johns finally reaches a head during the desert trek.  There are issues of blame and responsibility, concerning Fry.  And also with Riddick, who balks at helping his fellow man.<p>Pitch Black is recommended to science fiction and action film audiences.  Riddick is a mysterious anti-hero, and Vin Diesel is absolutely riveting on screen.  His voice slow and errie.  A sequel based on the character Riddick, is in pre-production phase.  Radha Mitchell is outstanding as Fry, a woman attempting to rise to the situation, seeking redemption.  A talented and busy actress, who will hopefully be seen more in mainstream films.  Pitch Black's two commentary tracks with director David Twohy are interesting and informative.  Shot in Australia, the creative techniques used to simulate a desert planet with three suns is just one of the topics discussed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Who's Her Daddy?"></head><body><p>Sophie has been raised on a remote Greek island by her mother Donna (Meryl Streep).  Donna has never told Sophie who her father is, and that has left a hole in Sophie's heart.<br /><br />But as her wedding to Sky (Dominic Cooper) nears, Sophie finds a journal her mother kept 21 years ago.  In it, she finds three potential candidate for her father, Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth), and Bill (Stellan Skarsgard).  Convinced that she will know her father on sight, she invites all three men without telling her mother.  But when all three men arrive, Sophie finds herself just as confused as she was before.  And their presence just complicates the wedding plans even further.  Will Donna recover from the surprise?  Will Sophie figure out who her father is?  Will the men discover why they are there?  And just how many great songs can be used to capture the feelings of the characters?<br /><br />I was not familiar with ABBA before I saw the movie, so pretty much had no clue what to expect.  And I loved these songs.  Honestly, if I didn't know where the music originated, I would have told you all the songs were written for the musical.  Not bad for a concept I dismissed as silly a few years back.  But these pop/rock sounds fit the story perfectly.<br /><br />And this cast can sing!  Meryl Streep is especially impressive as Donna, and gets the most songs.  The emotion she gets into so many of the songs is outstanding but hardly surprising considering how great an actress she is.  The only weak link in the singing department was Pierce Brosnan.  He is adequate while the others are outstanding.  But that's a minor point.<br /><br />With the number of songs in the movie, there is no way that they can develop all the characters well, especially since the film is under two hours.  Donna and her two friends are the best developed, followed by Sophie.  Honestly, I was disappointed with how little development Sky got.  I thought he'd play a bigger role.  And I had a hard time keeping the back story on the three potential dads straight.<br /><br />But I was certainly pulled into the story, wanting to know how things would end.  I felt the climax was rushed to make way for one more song, the only time I felt that way about the story.<br /><br />This movie will leave you humming a tune with a smile on your face.  That's all I ask from a musical.</p></body></html>

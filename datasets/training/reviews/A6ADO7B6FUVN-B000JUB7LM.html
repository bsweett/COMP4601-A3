Eastwood's precision never changed as he continued to act and began shooting his own films, which includes mysterious Westerns such as the High Plains Drifter (1974) to geriatric cowboys in Unforgiven (1992).  Unforgiven is regarded by many critics as one of the best films of the 90s.  This politically active actor and director has also made films about Charlie Parker, proud Marines, stealthy thieves, and childhood tragedies.  Several of Eastwood's films have received Oscar nominations in many categories as did Mystic River (2003), which was considered one of the best films of 2003.  Nonetheless, it seems as if Eastwood has searched within himself through decades of experience and wisdom, as he has found something special that can be seen most recently in Million Dollar Baby.<br /><br />Ding, the bell sounds, as the first round commences where two fighters stare down each other's eyes while instinctively attempting to dance the boxers tap to sweet victory.  Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) knows everything there is about the boxers tap, as he routinely utters, "You have to protect yourself" with his hoarse voice.  It is in the ring where Frankie is most comfortable, which has always been regarded as a mans world to him.  In addition, Frankie has acquired this knowledge of boxing through years of training and observing a mass of fighters loosing and winning, but also seeing many of them get seriously hurt.<br /><br />When Frankie does not coach his boxers, he studies Gaelic, reads Yates, and dwells on the many mysteries of life.  Through attending daily masses, Frankie questions his faith, but also harasses the Priest with annoying questions.  However, it seems as if Frankie is stuck in his own-trained mentality as he instinctively does what he teaches, defending oneself, as some say it is hard to teach an old dog new tricks.  Yet, this old dog, Frankie that is, seeks continuously new knowledge, but never seems to progress with wisdom as his defensive instincts prevent him from reaching greater wisdom.<br /><br />Frankie's defensive instincts seem to prevent him from taking on female fighters and training them as he trains males.  It also seems as if Frankie perceives women, or as he refers to the women, girls, as too weak and not fit to fight.  This male chauvinistic approach that Frankie has could have caused him difficulty in his past, as he has a daughter with whom he cannot communicate.  When someone asks Frankie about his daughter it appears as if he tries to avoid it, yet being truthful, as he gives quick responses and smiles.  Frankie's behavior in regards to his daughter gives an impression that he tries to protect himself.<br /><br />Despite what Frankie's instincts say, he meets a girl, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), that is particularly hardheaded about having him as her coach, and he ends up training her.  Initially, Maggie asks Frankie whether he is interested in training her to which he responds, "I don't train girls".  Maggie does not seem to be discouraged as she joins Frankie's gym, pursuing her dream, as Frankie continuously reminds her that he does not coach girls.  This bickering  between Maggie and Frankie continues until Scrap (Morgan Freeman), a retired boxer and friend of Frankie, recognizes Maggie's tremendous intrinsic drive and determination.  Despite Frankie's directions not to help Maggie, Scrap, who lives and works in the gym, offers her some small tips on how to box, which results in improvement.  When Maggie displays her progress it leads to a small discussion between her and Frankie in which he offers to help her until she can get a manager of her own.<br /><br />Million Dollar Baby could in many aspects be compared to other boxing films such as Rocky (1976), Girlfight (2000), Raging Bull (1980), and Champ (1979). However, it does not focus on boxing, but rather the characters and their decisions in life.  The training of Maggie brings both Frankie and her on a soul searching journey as they travel to visit her family, across Europe, and to a shot for the world title.  However, the fight scenes do not become an overburden of desire to win glory, money, or a title.  Instead Maggie boxes to display her respect and loyalty to Frankie, which guides them into a long and painful exploration as they get closer to one another.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood lays down the six shooter from his past as his marksmanship aims for empathy and poignant solution.  The empathetic feeling in Million Dollar Baby could be tough on the audience as it could be emotionally and physically draining, in some aspects, and it could feel as if the audience fought a 15 round match and lost.  Under the direction of Eastwood the cast performs exceptionally as they supported each other and stand out by themselves.  The cinematography interestingly uses plenty of shadows in order to enhance the drama within each scene, which is something that Eastwood is known to do on occasion.  Ultimately, the audience will have experienced brilliant cinema, which offers much to ponder while recovering from the punches of Eastwood's brilliant direction.</p></body></html>

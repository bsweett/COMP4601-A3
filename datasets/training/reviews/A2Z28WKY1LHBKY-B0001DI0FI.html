A lot of information was gained from the communication between the characters, and it was easy to understand that they were chasing that ship because of the captain's sense of purpose and duty. It was full of incident, and every scene added to the movie's depth. It was interesting all the way, and there was plenty of excitement. In the end the captain was fooled by the enemy captain faking his identity, so it was decided to escort the French prize back to Valparaiso. There weren't any useless scenes to delete, and the ending was good. A very entertaining and instructive movie, and definitely worth watching, even if you're not a Russell Crowe fan.</p></body></html>

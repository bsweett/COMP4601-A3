<meta name="summary" content="A romantic comedy for those who don't like romantic comedies."></head><body><p>I'm not a fan of the romantic comedy genre, and I winced a bit when my wife suggested this movie, but I'd be lying if I said anything other than I very much enjoyed it.<br /><br />I figured Jack Nicholson would draw me into the story.  I can't say I'm a big Jack Nicholson fan, but I always seem to become quickly interested in movies that he stars in.  Perhaps I'm just a Jack Nicholson fan in denial.<br /><br />Helen Hunt to me is the driving force behind this movie.  I do think I became a Helen Hunt fan.  No denial there.<br /><br />However, what makes the whole thing work is the supporting cast.  Everyone is good.  We've even got Yeardley Smith, the voice of Lisa Simpson!  Then there's the dog; perhaps the cutest ugly dog ever.<br /><br />Anyway, unlike others I doubt I'll watch this movie again, but I'm sure glad I saw it once.  Not quite "as good as it gets" for me in terms of movies, but way way better than I thought it would be.</p></body></html>

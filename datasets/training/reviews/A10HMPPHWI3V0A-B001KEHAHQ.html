Steve Martin"></head><body><p>After reading the screenplay of this movie there would be no way in He*l that I would believe if I told myself I was going to give this film a 3 out of 5. It is pitiful. Whoever wrote this screenplay should go back to learning they're ABC's. This movie was saved only by Steve Martin's performance as Inspector Clouseau. Steve Martin's Witty accent and dumb behavior is absolutly hilarious, the screenplay works around the humor but the storyline and everything else are so completely clishe it makes me sick to my stomache. Usually I have alot more to say about a movie but this time I am at a loss of words.<br /><br />Final thought: The movie was bad but saved, somewhat by Steve Martins Witty humor. Your smaller kids will like it and you will find yourself laughing on quite a few occastions. You might as well just buy a stand up comedy film because you wont give a rats a*s about what is happening and what will happen<br /><br />Grade: C-<br /><br />Then again what do I know I am only 16 ...</p></body></html>

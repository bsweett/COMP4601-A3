No, it was not a movie you can enjoy- it was a movie you can watch, and get a feeling of American history.  It's an important movie that anyone who was around in 2001 can understand.  It was such a horrible day, and this movie did a really good job at showing us *probably* what happened on that flight.<br /><br />No one knows exactly what happened on that flight, but I'm guessing the creators used the phone calls from the people on the flight to gather information in order to make this movie.  For example, as someone was calling home to a relative or a friend, I'm guessing they used the sounds they heard in the background and put the pieces together to make up what probably happened, without being entirely sure.  No one knows for sure that the passengers used a giant tray to block the terrorists inside the cockpit, but maybe sounds were heard in the background that led to that being a possibility, since we have tapes of the phone calls being made.  Hey, I may be wrong, and I apologize if I am.<br /><br />Well, I felt I needed to watch this movie and see what happened that horrible day, and maybe get a better idea of what may have happened on that flight.  The only thing I can say is that this is a movie that needs to be watched.</p></body></html>

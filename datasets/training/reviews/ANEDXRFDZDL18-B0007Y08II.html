<meta name="summary" content="Funny, Irreverant Humor!"></head><body><p>I honestly didn't know what to expect when I saw Team America. For some reason, I thought it would be a serious `kids style' action movie with a few funny grown up lines thrown in for the adults.  Well, you can imagine my surprise at seeing a parody of a parody. With puppets... Parodying puppets, actors, and serious real life events! And I LOVED it! Seriously, there wasn't anyone in the theater who wasn't laughing themselves silly with the gross, irreverent, and at times shocking humor and wacky and outrageously wicked events.<br /><br />This film is NOT  for the kiddies. I repeat. NOT for the kiddies. Or for those who are overly sensitive. There were a few scenes that embarrassed even me (such as the lisping dictator character), and the scene where one of the puppets shared a past traumatic event that happened in the backstage of Cats. Eww....The odd thing was...Even though these characters were mere puppets...I ended up caring about them. I wanted the farm boy puppet to get together with the Lucy Liu look-alike, and I cared whether they lived and died towards the end.<br /><br />This was a shockingly wicked film, with some amazing puppeteering that I quite honestly didn't expect to like! 5 stars! I laughed throughout the film.</p></body></html>

Part horror, time travel, romance, medical and war drama, with a thriller narrative at its core, there's no doubt that The Jacket is  imminently watchable, but it's hampered by its slick, stylish, and psuedo art-house self-importance.<br /><br />Borrowing heavily from a number of different genres, The Jacket tells the story of Jack Starks (Adrien Brody). Jack has just taken a bullet to the brain in the Persian Gulf War and he is pronounced dead. But he somehow survives and is shipped home to Vermont suffering from amnesia. The last thing he remembers is walking up a snowy road and stopping to help an alcoholic mom, Jean (Kelly Lynch) and her little daughter when their truck stalls.<br /><br />He then hitches a ride with a stranger (Brad Renfro), who is pulled over by a highway patrolman. The stranger kills the cop, and Jack blacks out, only to wake up to accusations he killed the officer. Deemed mentally ineffectual, Jack is shipped off to a psychiatric hospital where he is tortured, mistreated, and filled with psychoactive drugs courtesy of the malevolent Dr. Becker (Kris Kristofferson).<br /><br />Becker is convinced that only through such radical treatments will Jack be cured of his propensity towards violence. He even puts Jack through a curative cycle that has him intermittently strapped in a straitjacket, placed on a gurney and wheeled into a morgue-like slot for solitary confinement in the dark. These treatments stir up Jack's sporadic visions and he begins to trip back and forth in time, from 1992 to 2007.<br /><br />In 2007 Jack connects with Jackie (Kira Knightley). Jackie is living an aimless, and sad life, working as a waitress in a local coffee shop. She's lonely and unhappy, her mother having recently died; she's also taken to drinking heavily. At first, she is wary of Jack and his time traveling story, but she agrees to help him unravel the mystery of his past, eventually becoming his supportive love interest.<br /><br />The secure and principled Dr. Lorenson (Jennifer Jason Leigh) perhaps holds the key to unlocking Jack's enigmatic dilemma. Did he really die, or is he a ghost, inexplicably traveling through time? Can fellow prisoner Mackenzie (Daniel Craig), a fellow patient who has tried several times to murder his wife, also help Jack unlock the mysteries of the jacket?<br /><br />The initial premise is interesting, but the story is too elaborate and complicated, and most viewers will probably walk away scratching their heads at the rather inadequate resolution to the story. The Jacket is also not really sure what it wants to be - it starts out as an icy, hard-hitting, and uncompromising thriller about medical abuse, but soon morphs into an otherworldly and ghostly love story.<br /><br />Plus director, John Maybury lays it all on a bit thick. There's the usual relentless and loud electronic sound design and an unremitting, choppily edited (and strangely unimaginative) visual format that projects Jack's memories and terrors onto his shaking eyeball. It's all rightfully unsettling at first, but soon leaves one feeling exhausted and somewhat worn-out after the first hour.<br /><br />On the plus side, the performances are pretty solid, with Brody gaining the lion's share of the acting kudos. He imbues Jack with a jumpy and nervy paranoia and manages to bring a strong conviction to even the most silliest moments in the story.<br /><br />The Jacket is an average slice of gothic horror that "twists genres as intentionally as it bends time." But don't let the exemplary cast full you; it's really just a movie with a slick production design masquerading as mediocrity.  Mike Leonard June 05</p></body></html>

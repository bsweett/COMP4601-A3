<meta name="summary" content="Theron demonstrates World Class Acting chops"></head><body><p>I was actually hesitant to see this, simply because, while I had followed the case of Wuornos, I had never been a full out Charlize Theron fan, judging her work based on 'Sweet November' and 'Devil's Advocate,' essentially I perceived her as attractive set dressing.<br /><br />Man, did Monster ever make me eat my words!  Theron delivers a true, jaw-droppingly good, transformative performance.  Having seen many documentaries on Wuornos, I was familliar with her, and Theron absolutely channels this woman.  Her physical transformation alone is brilliant, but the way she adds a depth of humanity and pathos to a very unsympathetic person is astounding.  It's not just a question of good 'mimickry,' but you actually do learn about how Aileen viewed the world, and can see it from her point of view, based solely on Theron's heartbreaking performance.  It truly is well worth purchasing this DVD, because work this good is rare.<br /><br />The story, however, leaves alot to be desired.  While not a bad retelling, certain facts are smudged, and the character Selby never existed, and is not as fully developed.  But the flaws are minor in light of Theron's no-jolds-barred attempt to humanize a serial killer who seemingly had no soul.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Revolution Without Dancing Is A Revolution Not Worth Having"></head><body><p>"V: Good evening, London. Allow me first to apologize for this interruption. I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of the every day routine- the security of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition. I enjoy them as much as any bloke. But in the spirit of commemoration, whereby those important events of the past, usually associated with someone's death or the end of some awful, bloody struggle, are celebrated with a nice holiday, I thought we could mark this November the 5th, a day that is sadly no longer remembered, by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a little chat. There are of course those who do not want us to speak. I suspect even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will soon be on their way. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those who are more responsible than others and they will be held accountable but again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent. Last night I sought to end that silence. Last night I destroyed the Old Bailey to remind this country of what it has forgotten. More than four hundred years ago a great citizen wished to embed the fifth of November forever in our memory. His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words, they are perspectives. So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you then I would suggest that you allow the fifth of November to pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me one year from tonight, outside the gates of Parliament, and together we shall give them a fifth of November that shall never, ever be forgot. "<br /><br />"V" is the symbol that everyone is waiting for. The man who makes right all the wrongs that have been done. He accomplishes this by violence as his vendetta, and that theme is where all goes wrong. Certainly, he accomplishes what he set out to do, but murder, violence are not what out country wants. We want peaceful solutions, although we have not found in our history that peace derives change. War and violence are usually needed to forgo change. The country cannot and will not accept that our Democratic principles will not allow it. "V" is our hero and is played brilliantly by Hugo Weaving. The heroine, Evey played by Natalie Portman is the victim and the unwanted heroine. She knows not what she is doing, but she understands it s a necessity.  The confusion that ensues in this movie is not hard to understand. A little bit of our history is needed to fully understand that HOPE is what is needed.<br /><br />"The two conflicting political viewpoints of anarchism and fascism permeate the story. The Norsefire regime shares every facet of fascist ideology: it rules by fear and authority and worships strong leadership (i.e. the f&uuml;hrerprinzip). However, the regime was put in place by democratic means, just like the regime in Nazi Germany. As in most fascist regimes, there are several different types of police and military police who engage in power struggles with each other yet obey the same leader." Wikipedia.<br /><br />Of note: "V for Vendetta deals with issues of race, sexuality, religion, totalitarianism, and terrorism. Its controversial storyline and themes have, inevitably, made it the target of both criticism and praise from different sociopolitical groups. Many libertarians, especially at the Mises Institute's LewRockwell.com see the film as a positive depiction in favor of a free society with limited government and free enterprise, citing the state's terrorism as being of greater evil and rationalized by its political machinery, while V's acts are seen as 'terrorist' because they are done by a single individual."<br /><br />The cast was well selected and superb.<br /><br />Stephen Rea ....  Inspector Eric Finch<br /><br /> Stephen Fry ....  Gordon Deitrich<br /><br /> John Hurt ....  Chancellor Adam Sutler<br /><br /> Tim Pigott-Smith ....  Creedy<br /><br />This is a totally different movie that grabs you and draws us in. I have heard only praise. Good family film.<br /><br />Highly recommended. prisrob 9-04-06</p></body></html>

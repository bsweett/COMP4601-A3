<meta name="summary" content="[3.5] NOT the box-office flop some would have you think!"></head><body><p>I know most have criticized this film for a wide variety of reasons that I completely understand, but for some odd reasons I still enjoyed this film although I know I should not have.<br /><br />The plot of this film has been reviewed to death, so I will go the route I've been going lately and simply discuss what elements I liked and disliked about this somewhat controversial film for which most were disappointed.<br /><br />The Misses:<br /><br />(1) Shoddy, dark cinematography used to disguise a low-budget film for a film that really should have had a massive budget considering the great success of both franchises and the concept of the film.<br />(2) Slow pacing for a film that should have been a non-stop action flick on par with Cameron's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000ILDE">Aliens (Special Edition)</a> -as if that were really possible.<br />(3) Some run-of-the-mill stereotypes of forgettable characters (yeah, I know, the aliens are supposed to be the stars).<br />(4) Lazy approach to great concept.<br />(5) Lack of research (respect) to the original franchises.<br />(6) The PG-13 rating is both a hit and miss with me.  ALL of the prior Alien films, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VCZK2">Alien Quadrilogy (Alien/ Aliens /Alien 3 /Alien Resurrection)</a>, and the only two Predator films, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GUJYQ0">Predator / Predator 2 - 2-Movie Gift Set</a>, where ALL R rated films for violence and language.  To some purist for these films and genre, that should have required an R rating for this film and anything less implies a departure from these films' roots and I agree (to a point . . . see #6 below).<br /><br />The Hits:<br /><br />(1) Great concept for a film (but rather lackadaisical implementation).<br />(2) Some spot on casting with Lance Henrikson returning as the human Bishop, the familiar face of Raoul Bova, and the stunningly beautiful and solid acting talents of Sanaa Lathan to whom this film owes an awful lot as the one character who is developed well-enough that we are rooting for her to survive in a situation where we expect all to die.<br />(3) Decent special effects and set designs when not shrouded in darkness.<br />(4) Occasionally humorous moments to ease up the tension.<br />(5) A terrific ending that clearly opens the door for what can be a sequel that may be better than the original AVP.<br />(6) The PG-13 rating has caused much fuss by fans of these franchises and I generally agree with them that these aliens thrive on violence and to downplay that here in a match up between the two is most annoying; however, I never cared for violence and gore for violence and gore's sake alone.  I think this film succeeds well enough under its more family friendly PG-13 rating and I, personally, prefer to watch movies with my whole family than with just my wife (which R would require).  This is just a matter of opinion here and personal preference, so keep your light sabers holstered if you disagree (just funning here).<br /><br />I generally enjoyed this film even though it is a considerable letdown from what it could have been.  I think sometimes we have to put that notion aside and just look at what we have and not all the "could have been's."  In addition, just because we disliked a film doesn't mean we should exaggerate the lack of success a film had (or vice versa).  This medium budget film, since $45 million isn't really "low budget" the film comes across as, went on to gross over $172 million world-wide, I think one is hard-pressed to call this film a flop and before one can say most of that was earned outside of the U.S. the U.S. take was slightly over $80 million.<br /><br />A hit in Hollywood is generally looked upon as film that rakes in about double what it cost to make, and that is especially true if the cast has no A-list stars like this film.  There are bigger expectation when a film has one or more A-listed stars like Will Smith, Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts or Jodie Foster.  AVP had no A-list stars and ended up grossing nearly 4x what it cost to make after world-wide distribution.  For all the criticisms of this film, I think its box-office receipts means somebody liked it and that I'm not alone even though I will admit that this film has many flaws.<br /><br />With the recent entry of AVP2 you might want to take a second look at this film.  It is better than most think it is (in my view).  And with that I will exit my 200th review.  Peace.</p></body></html>

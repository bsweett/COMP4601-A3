When I first saw it I could not remember the last time a movie had me glued to the tv so strong that I could not wait to see what was going to happen next.  It does remind me a little of "The Edge", with anthony hopkins but more interesting.  A film that should keep your attention well from the start to end and then some.  It's not a sci-fiction, war or animated type picture but a tense drama that keeps you in suspense.  For sure a Tom Hanks classic.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></body></html>

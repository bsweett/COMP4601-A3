<meta name="summary" content="Truly mesmerizing from start to finish, a film one won't soon forget..."></head><body><p>Despite the fact that `Ray' was just released the year prior to critical acclaim, even winning an Oscar or two, and the fact that the life story of Johnny Cash is in a way very similar the film `Walk the Line' does a brilliant job of making this life story all that much more compelling and entertaining than last years submission.  This is due in large part to the fantastic performances of the entire cast, most notably Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon and the Oscar snubbed Ginnifer Goodwin who brilliantly balances support, frustration and sympathy as Cash's ex wife Vivian.  James Mangold has that same eye for detail as Hackford possessed in `Ray' but he ups the ante by fleshing out not only the demons that corrupted Cash's soul but also the angel that saved him in the end, notably June Carter.<br /><br />Right off the bat we are introduced to the Cash household and immediately the lines are drawn as in who the supportive parent and who the dominating overbearing parent is, and when the tragic death of Johnny's older brother shakes things up within that household no one is ever truly the same afterward.  Racked with guilt for not being there when he was hurt and or being the surviving sibling Johnny lived the majority of his life with suppressed grief and constant dissatisfaction with any of his many accomplishments.  The film beautifully flows through his adolescent life in the army, his early life married sweetheart Vivian and then the early points in his career until fame and fortune drove Johnny to drugs and, you guessed it, women.<br /><br />But it was one woman who stole his heart and cured his soul, and that was June Carter, played brilliantly by Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon.  Her charisma, charm and sincerity helped tame a tortured man and gave him reason to believe in himself and in the prospect of living a happy and fulfilling life once and for all.  The film chronicles their love affair from its rocky start, shaky middle and everlasting end and it does so with such elegance and patience that the viewer becomes so invested in these characters as people and we begin to sympathize, rationalize and relate to their very souls.  Phoenix is a force to be reckoned with as he attacks Cash's very being with such reverence and determination that I felt I witnessed the birth of a true star, and Witherspoon earned her Oscar with the same fiery determination evident in her co-star.<br /><br />The supporting players all pull their weight as well, from Ginnifer Goodwin's Oscar worthy performance to Robert Patrick's sinister father, the man we loathe in entirety yet learn isn't without saving, as well as the entire cast of young actors and musicians all help create a feeling and a mood that perfectly compliments the films purpose.  Not a single performance is forced, out of place or unworthy of mention.<br /><br />Another highlight is the music, all of which was sung by the actual actors themselves, which is another step-up from last years `Ray'.  Both Joaquin and Reese devour each sung line with enthusiasm and pure talent and it also helps cement them into their characters, fleshing out both Johnny and June and making them more real.  These are in no way shape or form mere imitations.  Both Phoenix and Witherspoon created these characters brilliantly and beautifully.  From the accurate sets to the costumes and stage performances `Walk the Line' is a fantastic biopic complete with acting bravado and a script that truly brings these legends to life.</p></body></html>

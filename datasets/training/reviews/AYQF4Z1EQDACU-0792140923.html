<meta name="summary" content="Tom Hanks' Masterpiece"></head><body><p>History is one thing when it's told in a book, it's something amazing when it's told by "Forrest Gump" The incredible story of the good hearted low IQ man from Alabama and his the highlights of his life that made him famous. He's a war hero who recieves the medal of honor, a football star, a shrimp boat captain, a ping pong player and a national celebrity, he's met 3 presidents- Johnson,Kennedy and Nixon, Elvis Presley, John Lennon, Dick Cavett. The Story also follows his personal life with his mother, his friends Dan Taylor and Bubba Blue and the love of his life since childhood, Jenny. One of the most extrodonary, inspiring movies of all time, terrific entertainment, a top notch classic, brilliant, Hanks is the greatest actor of this age. Winner of 6 Academy including Best Picture, Best Actor Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis- the man behind the Back to the Future Trilogy and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. This is one of my favorite films of all time.</p></body></html>

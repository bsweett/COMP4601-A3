<meta name="summary" content="One of the best"></head><body><p>This is one of the best sci-fi movies, one of the best comedies and all round one of the most enjoyable films as far as I am concerned. The idea behind the film is clever, the dialog is crisp and witty, there is great use of film techniques, the acting is first-class and the movie doesn't waste a second. It's got more action packed into 98 minutes than you'll find in most 2 1/2 hour movies AND their sequels combined.<br /><br />Worth watching over and over again to see all the throw-away pieces of business, funny asides and topical references layered into the main body of the film. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are wonderfully well cast and Linda Fiorentino delivers her lines with such great timing and conviction that it takes a couple of viewings to realise how good at comedy she is.<br /><br />Not to be missed.</p></body></html>

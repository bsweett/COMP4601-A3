<meta name="summary" content="Which is Best?"></head><body><p>Firstly, an admission; I have not read the eponymous book on which this film is based.  However, I have recently watched the more recent film starring Daniel Craig and produced with American money.  As a result, it is inevitable that comparisons will be made between the two films.<br /><br />As much as it may pain some people, I found myself enjoying the Craig film much more.  In terms of plot, they are near identical although I cannot comment on how closely they both following the original book.  Indeed, the only difference I noted was that the surviving niece was located in Australia rather than London.  This is just a minor detail and makes no impact upon the overall plot.<br /><br />"The Girl with Dragon Tattoo" is certainly a dark and menacing film. I was thoroughly taken in by the plot which, although full of various twists and turns, was not difficult to follow.  The screenwriter has done an admirable job.  Too often films can be let down by plot complexities where the viewer is perplexed as to what happened.<br /><br />So, overall this is a good production.  But, as I stated at the outset, the second film is superior to this original.  I might add that this conclusion of mine has nothing to do with sub-titles or dubbing.  It is simply an honest opinion and comparison of the two efforts.  Regardless, I encourage people to see both.  Come to your own conclusions.  You will be rewarded either way.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A decent movie that takes pause to think"></head><body><p>All of our main characters survive that in reality most if not would have died had these events really happened.  They built a pretty good story around a worst case scenario and the acting wasn't bad, not great but 3 stars.  I've watched this movie a couple of times and I think that's all the life I will get out of it, worth watching, but not worthy of library space.</p></body></html>

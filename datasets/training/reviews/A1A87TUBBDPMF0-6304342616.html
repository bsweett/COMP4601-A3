The plot is essentially the same as most "alien invasion" movies of those Red-scare 1950s: flying saucers appear literally out of the blue, we try to make contact, they invade, we resist.  Chaos ensues, there are big battles with the Bug Eyed Monsters (BEMs), cities are destroyed, and the war goes the BEMs' way until some scientist or brave military hero comes up with either a wonder weapon or last-minute desperation tactic and saves the day.  (And often in these movies the male lead ended up smooching with the female lead....)<p>And it is exactly this back-to-the-future "retro" feel that is the heart of Independence Day's appeal.  It takes all these clich&eacute;s and makes them work in such a way that audiences familiar with "invaders from space" can recognize the tongue-in-cheek tone of Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's screenplay and smile, and there are lots of visual and dialogue tips of the hats to films such as Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and other science fiction series.  Still, the strongest influence is War of the Worlds, not only thematically but structurally as well.<p>For instance, in both the original 1890s novel and the modernized George Pal version of War of the Worlds, a trio of emissaries waving a white flag approach the Martians' landing cylinder, only to be vaporized by the invaders' heat ray.  In Independence Day there is a similar scene, when a trio of especially fitted helicopters attempts to communicate with the aliens' ship over Washington.  The aliens respond to this Close Encounters-style light show with a violent show of force.<p>In another echo of Pal's 1950s movie, President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman) reluctantly orders a B-2 Spirit to attack one of the alien vessels with nuclear weapons.  Not only does the attack fail miserably as in War of the Worlds, but the B-2A itself is based on the Northrop "flying wing" which appeared in the older film (making use of stock film of test flight footage, since the flying wing was never in U.S. Air Force service).<p>Even the ending is derived from H.G. Wells' novel, though the twist that Devlin and Emmerich used was not only clever but very 1990s.  Instead of being infected by Earth germs as the Martians were in War of the Worlds, in this film the creepy BEMs are done in by....a computer virus created by David Levinson (Goldblum).  (And if you have not seen the sequence when Levinson and Marine pilot Steven Hiller [Smith] plant the virus aboard the alien ship, keep your eyes open for a reference to another classic science fiction film!)<p>Independence Day comes in two versions of the DVD: a barebones one-disc edition which has both the theatrical and Special Editions of the movie, commentary by Emmerich and Devlin, commentary by the visual effects supervisors, plus the usual language and subtitles options.  20th Century Fox Home Entertainment also released a pricier 2-disc Five Star Collection edition which has this disc plus another extra features disc.  I have the one-disc edition, and though I miss the theatrical trailers and other goodies, I am satisfied with the DVD I own.</p></body></html>

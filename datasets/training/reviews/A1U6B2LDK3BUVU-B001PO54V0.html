<meta name="summary" content="One great dance number stands out"></head><body><p>I have to start off by agreeing with John Grabowski, who reviewed this movie only two days ago.  Singing In The Rain is a three star movie, not anywhere near being one of the greatest movies of all time, and for those of you who call it the greatest, I have to wonder why you are saying that.  This is a good movie with strong music and dance performances but be real, it is what it is, period, a three star movie.<br /><br />The one "five star" thing about it is the famous dance number by Gene Kelly to the title song.  Kelly is so happy, so graceful, it's a pleasure to watch.  Perhaps that is all that the other reviewers are thinking about when they give the entire movie five stars.  But the rest of the movie is a bit dopy.</p></body></html>

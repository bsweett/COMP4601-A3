The MacGyver explosives and overcoming trained CIA/secret service/Russian agents were unbelievable and poorly executed even for a movie.<br />(2.) The running acrobatics and shooting scenes were also poorly executed and really old.<br />(3.) Really wooden/robotic acting and the Russian stereotypes showcase the lack of imagination in writing and directing.<br />(4.) Script was typical movie spy banter from writers who's experience in such a domain must consist of watching old spy movies.<br />(5.) Angelina needs to spend a bit of time on her fitness as hers kicks and even the task of holding a gun were all weak and shaky.<br />(6.) Elevator shafts and helicopters over water and unlimited firepower and the other gimmicks are just OLD!<br />(7.) Angelina, you should be embarrassed! I suggest donating your check to a worthy cause such as helping educate girls and women in Afghanistan.</p></body></html>

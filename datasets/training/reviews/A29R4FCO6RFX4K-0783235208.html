<meta name="summary" content="The Mummy"></head><body><p>Stephen Sommer's remake of the Boris Karlof original is a fun, if sometimes silly take on the story of the Mummy. A huge box-office success in the summer that gave us The Matrix and The Phantom Menace in 1999, this action- adventure is big on action, great SFX and witty laughs. Taking ideas from other films (Indiana Jones), it nonetheless is a cracking adventure tale that starts off great and builds up with a huge string of sequences and set pieces. <p>Sommers, who gave us The Jungle Book (1995) and Deep Rising (1998) gets a bigger budget, some great ideas and impressive SFX creations. Starring Brendan Fraser, Rachael Weiz, Arnold Vosloo and John Hannah, The Mummy is great pocorn- munching entertainment, with some amusing, well-timed humour and great action set pieces. Watching a CGI Mummy seek vengeance on the group who wake him up is so much fun. However, the story tends to get silly, and the script is rather wooden. And the film, inevitably, spawned the inferior The Mummy Returns. Sequels notwithstanding, it's a B movie with an A grade budget and a top cast, and the DVD is packed with tons of extras on the making of the film. Good fun.</p></body></html>

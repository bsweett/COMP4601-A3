<meta name="summary" content="DEATH IS HIS ART AND HE'S ABOUT TO PAINT HIS MASTERPIECE!"></head><body><p>Denzel Washington plays an alcoholic bodyguard who vows to take revenge on anyone who profited from the kidnapping of the little girl whom he was protecting.<br /><br /> Man on Fire was a great movie, it seems as though you pretty much know the story and you expect certain things to happen but the plot twists and turns in such a way that you will find yourself on the edge of your seat the throughout the entire movie asking yourself, what is going to happen next? and the way that the subtitling was done was also a nice touch.<br /><br /> This is definitely one of Denzel's best movies and a must see for anybody who is tired of all these wannabe action/dramas that have been coming out latley.<br /><br /> It's not often that a truly great movie comes around, but after seeing this movie I am convinced, and hopefully you will be too; Man on Fire is truly great!</p></body></html>

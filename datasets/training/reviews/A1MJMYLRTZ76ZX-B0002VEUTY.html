<meta name="summary" content="Exciting and entertaining flick"></head><body><p>I enjoyed this movie although I wasn't familiar with Riddick from my sci-fi reading--I assume it's an idea from the graphic novel genre. The story visually and thematically combines elements of Egyptian theology, Greek iconography, and good old Roman military theory and ideals, along with some tried and true elements derived from traditional fantasy and science fiction. Along with the stunning visual effects, the result is a visually appealing and action filled movie that held my interest for the full two hours.<br /><br />I don't know who designed all the sets or the visuals, but he did a spectacular job, and the whole the movie has a unified and consistent look that is very convincing. The prison world is also very well done. The escape scene on the prison world where they show the effects of the deadly solar terminator is just terrific. Vin Diesel is perfect in the role of Riddick and seemed made for the part. Overall, I thought this was an exciting and entertaining movie based on the Riddick story line that I'm sure won't disappoint the fans. I give it four stars here, but really, I think it rates four and a half.</p></body></html>

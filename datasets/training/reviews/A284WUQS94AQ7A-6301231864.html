<meta name="summary" content="How can I out do the Zombie Crunch?"></head><body><p>My buddy C. Blackshere, wrote a review on this classic horror movie in August and I certainly can't out do his wit!  But this is my version...<br /><br />This movie is about "freshly" dead people that come back to life (walking like freaky zombies) to eat flesh.  The cause for their awakening is due to a possible radition contamination.<br /><br />A group of sane people are hiding out in a house. One smart guy figures that he could board up the windows in this abandon house and wait it out.  He breaks nearly every piece of wood furniture in the place to board up the windows so the zombies couldn't enter.  I didn't know furniture could break that easily!  But then again, I underestimated my big poodle, Beau.  Anyway, the group struggles and eventually the zombies win and get them all, but one...<br /><br />While I respect this movie as a horror classic, the story and filming were good for its time (1968), the acting was pretty bad and detracted from the story a bit for me.  The group was having a power struggle on deciding whether to go to the basement or remain on the first floor.  I couldn't understand why they didn't go to the upper floor and throw Molotov cocktails out the windows and remain there.  The zombies were having trouble walking, much less climbing the stairs!<br /><br />All in all it is a good classic horror film to watch this time of month, just be blind to the acting.</p></body></html>

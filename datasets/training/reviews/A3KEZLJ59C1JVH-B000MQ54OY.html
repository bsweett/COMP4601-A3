<meta name="summary" content="A little more "Happy Feet," a little less depressing conservation issues"></head><body><p>I have to say, I was a bit disappointed by "Happy Feet." I was so excited when all the trailers for this film initially came out, but then it took me forever to see the movie, and when I finally did, I thought it didn't live up to the hype.<br /><br />The premise of the story is cute enough. The whole deal with this group of penguins is that they're all talented singers, except for poor Mumble (voiced by Elijah Wood), who can't carry a tune to save his life. Mumble is rejected by his fellow penguins, with the exception of his mother (voiced by Nicole Kidman) and Gloria (voiced by Brittany Murphy), the female penguin who captured Mumble's heart from day one. Even Mumble's dad (voiced by Hugh Jackman) is disappointed in his son. However, what Mumble lacks in vocal talent is made up by his incredible dance moves. Unfortunately, though, none of the other penguins in the colony are impressed by Mumble's "happy feet," so he instantly becomes an outcast.<br /><br />I wish this could be the basic plot of the movie, but it's not. I figured the film was all about how one penguin's special talent was eventually accepted by everyone else and the moral of the story would be that individuality should always be celebrated, blah blah blah. That's part of the story, but not all of it. I expected the whole film to be filled with dancing, singing penguins, but that only makes up about 20% of the movie, if that. The majority of "Happy Feet" stresses an environmental message about pollution and animal well-being, and obviously that's a very important message, but I thought it was major overkill in this case. There were times when I actually felt extremely depressed watching "Happy Feet," and that was so wrong! Also, in my opinion, the movie is way too long, and of course all the depressing parts of the film were dragged out to the extreme.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is an enjoyable film with fun songs and cute dancing penguins. However, the "happy feet" aspect of the film was much smaller than I expected, which is why I was kind of let down by this movie. If there's going to be a "Happy Feet 2," it needs to be at least 75% dancing penguins and 25% depressing environmental issues...and try to make it slightly less depressing! After all, this is supposed to be a fun movie for kids, not an Al Gore documentary. The word "happy" is in the title, for god's sake!</p></body></html>

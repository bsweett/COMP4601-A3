Most are familiar with the story: a Chicago-based vascular surgeon Dr. Richard Kincaid (Ford) returns home to find an intruder and his wife nearly dead from the attack. The CPD cannot substantiate the story and believe the good doctor murdered his wife instead.  Dr. Kincaid is sentenced to death by lethal injection due to the particularly heinous nature of the crime. He gets a lucky break when the inmates on his prisoner transport break out.  Instead of running for the border, Dr. Kincaid returns to Chicago to find the person who killed his wife.  U. S. Marshal Sam Girard is assigned to the case---Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal in this particular film was what spawned his role in "US Marshals" another case where he ends up proving the innocence of the person he is seeking.</p></body></html>

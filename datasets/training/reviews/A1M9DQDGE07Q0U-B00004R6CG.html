<meta name="summary" content="The Sublime Mr. Hitchcock"></head><body><p>A brooding, romantic, psychological thriller, Vertigo is considered by many critics today to be Hitchcock's most sublime cinematic masterpiece.  Upon its initial release the film was something of a misfit for audiences who had been weened on more narrative film fare.  But Hitch's highly personal exploration of phobias and obsession continues to enthrall.  James Stewart is a P.I. with a fear of heights who is contracted by an old friend to follow his wife (Kim Novak).  The catch, the whole plot is a sham designed to cover up a real murder.  Both Novak and Stewart give stellar performances.<br />In the 1990's a complete restoration was performed on Vertigo under the meticulous supervision of Robert A. Harris and James Katz. But the DVD doesn't take full advantage of those efforts.  Gone is the DTS stereo track, replaced with a 5.1 Dolby Digital mix instead.  Also, although presented in its original VistaVision aspect ratio (1:85:1) as reprinted onto 70mm film stock, the DVD has not been enhanced for 16X9 televisions - a real bore.  Over all, the picture quality is remarkable.  Colors are rich and textured and flesh tones are accurate.  There are a few minor occasions where shimmering details are noticed but nothing that terribly distracts. Still, Universal needs to go back and remaster this title again, this time with DTS and a new anamorphic transfer.  Since that doesn't seem to be a likely possibility in the near future this disc will have to do for the time being.  As a restoration effort, Vertigo definitely won't disappoint.  The DVD's just a bit of a disappointment, that's all.<p>Included: the AMC documentary, "Obsessed with Vertigo", theatrical trailers and an audio commentary track.  Nicely put together. A true legend deserves no less.</p></body></html>

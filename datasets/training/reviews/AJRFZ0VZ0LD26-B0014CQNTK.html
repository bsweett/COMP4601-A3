<meta name="summary" content="Modern day movie about teenage pregnancy"></head><body><p>This film was talk about town because it tackles the hot topic of teenage pregnancy. Juno is 16 year old girl, curious about sex, who after one time experiment with her schoolmate finds out she is pregnant.  Juno is pretty, smart and has sarcastic sense of humor.  Her mother and father are divorced and remarried to other people.  While Juno lives with her father (somewhere in Midwest), her Mom has started her new family in Arizona and it is obvious that their relationship is distant and strained.  Juno's family is a typical lower class family.  Her father repairs heating and air conditioning, her stepmom is working as a nail technician while juggling her new family.  But they are all detached from the fact that Juno is approaching age when talking about sex and educating her about it long past due.  It is cute to see how her parents take her pregnancy in stride, but to me it is not believable that they would be so galant about it.  The wisecracking of young Juno makes her somewhat less appealing becuase she can be crass.  One almost does not want a girl like that to be a mother at all.  Sarcasm like that is underlining major unhappiness and babies sure can benefit from happy moms.  Besides, I do not believe that small town America talks the way most people talk and behave in this movie.  While the script adds on the entertainment value it just isn't real.  For some reason, I found soundtrack on thsi movie annoying.  I know that many people have found it cute becuase it is so off beat, but I like music that sounds pleasing, not baby talk bluring sounds with a cute background noise.  Let's hope young girls learn something from this film (I am not trying to be a prude when I say this)- in that respect I think that film adds value to a new generation of young women whose parents are in denial about their sexual coming of age.</p></body></html>

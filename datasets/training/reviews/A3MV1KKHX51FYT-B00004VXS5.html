Shots are fired, and Tuco escapes. Then a bounty hunter visits an isolated house, searching for "Jackson". He learns the new name of "Bill Carson" (they were part of a gang of robbers). There is an exchange of opinions, shots are fired. The bounty hunter leaves to report to his boss, and perform another job. Next we see a wanted man captured by three men. Another man shows up to eliminate the competition, like a lion driving away hyenas. The wanted man is turned in for the reward. But his hanging is prevented, and he rides away to be recycled. [Can you believe this?]<br /><br />Tuco catches up to his former partner and captures him, the tables are turned. [This is like a cartoon.] Just like it looks like it is over for "Blondie" a runaway wagon appears to begin a new story! A dying man tells of a buried treasure of stolen payroll. Now Tuco must care for "Blondie" because he knows the name on the grave that contains the treasure. As they ride away, they see a gray troop of cavalry coming for them. The gray turns out to be dust on their blue uniforms. [Another joke.] Now they are prisoners and sent to a camp. [Was there really combat in the southwest?] This film is like a succession of short stories linked through the same characters.<br /><br />Tuco manages to escape from the train. Later "Blondie" escapes and they meet again. There is more gunplay in eliminating the competition for their business deal. They arrive at a huge cemetery, much too large for the small town shown in this film. [Obviously staged.] And so there is a showdown between the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Scratch one rival. The film ends with a sick joke about hanging. I wonder why some people rate this film highly?<br /><br />The vocalized song means there is no problem in translation to another language. [Isn't it funny?] The most interesting part is how a 1950s style Western was created by Europeans after they became obsolete in Hollywood. Not that they can't do better.</p></body></html>

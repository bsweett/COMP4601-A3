It was a perfect suspense-thriller, horror flick, character study, mood piece, and most effectively, psychological drama.  &quot;Hannibal&quot; doesn't bother to try its hand at all of these, and who's to blame it for that?  The ones it does try for (thriller, horror flick, mood piece) are pulled off with aplomb.  It's full of blood and gore, all in the name of some serious campy fun (&quot;fun&quot; being the key word here).  And on top of that it manages to be a pretty gripping love story, too.  Well... within the context of the serial killer genre, that is.<p>&quot;Hannibal&quot; doesn't shy away from references to its frequently decorated parent.  We are played tapes of past Lecter/Starling interviews, are reunited with Barney the nurse, and are shown that Hannibal still fits into that gruesome green mask.  Knowledge of &quot;Silence&quot;, then, is mandatory.  But &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a different animal, so to speak.  It doesn't take itself so seriously.  For example, any suggestion of the sexism that Clarice must overcome in the FBI is over-the-top and cartoonish.  And, like &quot;Silence&quot;, it revels in its showstopper set pieces.  But where in &quot;Silence&quot; we weren't shown the violence and the gore, &quot;Hannibal&quot; leaves no stone unturned.  Witness the splattering on the pavement after Lecter disembowels then hangs a pursuer, or the finale featuring Ray Liotta (if you haven't yet been tipped off about this scene, you soon will) that leaves little for the mind's eye to fill in.  Whereas some have found these scenes distasteful and unnecessary, I beg to differ.  They serve two purposes: a distancing from the style of &quot;Silence, and a celebration of the campy fun that dominates the film's tone.<p>That's not to say that everything in the film is over the top and outrageous.  There are several scenes in which information is conveyed with shrewd restraint.  I'm thinking mainly of a quick scene that reveals what happened to Lecter's predecessor at a University library, and the chilling epilogue that resolves any unanswered questions left after the denouement (I'm loathe to give too much away here; please discover these scenes for yourself).  Those in the audience expecting to have their hands held throughout the plot will miss much here, if they don't pay close attention.  Kudos to director Scott for trusting his audience's intellect.<p>Anthony Hopkins reprises his role as the good doctor, and does a superb job showing how the man has evolved over the last ten years.  He is still frightening as hell, but also more assured, jubilant, and especially playful.  Age has allowed Lecter to relax within his skin (would a &quot;Silence&quot;-era Hannibal have gotten away with giddily exclaiming &quot;Okey-Dokey&quot; when moving in for a kill?), while honing his ability to control his deviant instincts.  It has also made him restless, which sets the narrative moving. <p>Julianne Moore doesn't really get to do much here, except allude to and update the performance that Jodie Foster gave as Clarice Starling.  In that respect, she does a bang-up job, subtly recreating her erratic accent while giving her a touch of world-weariness.  But really, this is not her movie, and the underwritten part shows that.<p>The Lecter/Starling relationship, which did much to drive &quot;Silence&quot;, is somewhat of a disappointment.  Sure, an ocean separates the two for much of the film's first half, but much more could have been done to enhance the connection between the characters.  As it is, the audience is expected to do much of the work, by remembering what they had going in &quot;Silence&quot; and transplanting it into this film.  That's just lazy filmmaking.  Still, Hopkins has a familiar chemistry with Moore, as he had with Foster, so any blemish is easily forgotten.<p>The rest of the cast has very little to work with, mostly playing one-dimensional characters to various degrees of success.  Gary Oldman, under mounds of make-up, is at his scene-stealing best as the only victim of Dr. Lecter who survived.  Ray Liotta on the other hand, as Starling's sexist superior, is just too ridiculous.  He is a distraction from the campy fun.  The one standout in this one-dimensional dramatis personae is Giancarlo Giannini.  He plays Rinaldo Pazzi, an Italian police detective who unwittingly gets more mixed up in the Lecter affair than he originally intended.  Giannini infuses his Pazzi with dollops of sadness (witness his droopy eyes), bumbling cunning, and subtly concealed fright.<p>I have not read Thomas Harris' source novel, and don't intend to.  So I can't speak to how the film holds up in comparison.  I can say that in comparison with &quot;Silence&quot; it is not close in matching that film's classic status.  However, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a fun, campy ride that left me with a feeling of adrenalized exhilaration on par with what I felt the first time that I saw &quot;Silence&quot;.</p></body></html>

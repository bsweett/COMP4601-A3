He's a terrific actor but he just doesn't cut it as a opium smoking Inspector Frederick Abberline. He's too young and frankly, if Abberline was this weird he wouldn't have lasted on the force.  Heather Graham is completely out of her depth. She looks wrong for the part, (How many street walkers look this healthy and pretty?) can't do the accent and can't act. Compare this to the Michael Caine version and you'll see how weak the Hughes Brothers' effor was.</p></body></html>

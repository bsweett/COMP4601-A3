What a fantastic rags-to-riches story he was; he got his first big Hollywood job as a gaffer on the little movie that could, The Doom Generation, and worked his way up to director in five years, giving the world Crime and Punishment in Suburbia. Yeah, it was a first film, with all the hallmarks of same. But really, no limits, right? This guy could be the best.<p>And then came 2003, and he gave us Wrong Turn. There have been a rash of bad horror movies since the success of Jeepers Creepers, and not a one of them even has the fun factor of JC. Add Wrong Turn to the list. At least it tries to be slightly different, but it fails. Painfully. <p>Do you really need a plot summary? Take a passel of teens. Add in a creepy serial killer. Let the bodies hit the floor. In this case, the passel of teens is headed up by the delicious Eliza Dushku (Bring It On, This Boy's Life) and Desmond Harrington (Riding in Cars with Boys), along with other previously-rising Hollywood gen-y types like Jeremy Sisto (the title role in TNT's recent miniseries of Julius Caesar) and Emmanuelle Chiriqui (Snow Day), whose careers have likely been destroyed by their appearances in this movie. The Deliverance-style bad guys are played by three actors who are one step below character actors (you know, "I was in this film as `truck driver #3!'"), with the only one who might've been recognizable without the makeup being Julian Richings, the Trent Reznor-lookalike janitor from similarly silly late-nineties horror flick Urban Legend. (If you're a longtime fan of bad horror, though, Gary Robbins had bad-horror-flick child-star status in the early eighties. Remember Humungous? Eh, you're probably better off...)<p>Crossing your typical slasher film with Deliverance sounds like a good idea, doesn't it? Actually, it's a fantastic idea. And to be fair to the producers, they did line up a potential-wunderkind director, a cast of potentially above-average stars, and came up with some absolutely gorgeous rural-west-virginia scenery, even if it's the backwoods version of "we're trying to make Toronto look like New York again" ("West Virginia" actually resides in Dundee, Ontario, for the purposes of this movie). They went painfully wrong in not changing Alan McElroy's script nearly enough (when your first sold script is for the dreadful Halloween 4, and your newest script is for... Halloween 9, you're pretty well locked into clich&eacute; mode. Worse, he was also responsible for Left Behind and Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever). In fact, I doubt anyone changed a single word. So you have a director and actors who, if you remove the "potentially" part, are at least capable. Blame this turkey on the script. And hope someone make another Deliverance-style gen-y horror film that actually does it right, because this one ain't it. **</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Deluxe Edition: The definitive version to get on DVD and a great 10th Year Anniversary tribute release!"></head><body><p>In 1999, "Galaxy Quest" was a film that surprised many sci fi fans when it was released to theaters.  At first, many people were not sure if it would be a parody to "STAR TREK" but in the end, the film was actually paying homage to the popular television series.<br /><br />The film is directed by television director David Parisot (who directed shows such as "Curb Your Enthusiasm", "Monk", "ER" and many other series) and is based on a story by David Howard and a screenplay co-written with Ric McElvin ("Men in Black II" , "Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events" and "Addicted to Love", etc.).<br /><br />The film has received praise from Star Trek alumni such as George Takei, Jonathan Frakes, Patrick Stewart and Will Wheaton and has received nearly all positive reviews from film critics upon its release in theaters back in 1999.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"Galaxy Quest - Deluxe Edition" has been digitally remastered for this DELUXE EDITION/10th Year release.  I haven't done any comparisons to my original 2000 DVD version of the film but I could tell by watching it, scenes like the mission obtain Beryllium, this would shine on Blu-ray.  But for now, on DVD the colors look vibrant with the Earth tone colors and blue skies make things absolutely beautiful.  Video is presented in widescreen.  So, overall, for a DVD release, the picture quality and the new remastering looked great.<br /><br />As for the audio, audio is presented ala English 5.1 Surround (as well as Spanish 5.1 Surround) and comes with a Thermian 2.0 Surround track.  I will say that watching this film again, I heard a good number special effects from the various channels.  Audio sounds very good, I was noticing small details such as the damaged spaceship, the Protector trying to use its remaining engines to move the ship and hearing it trying to move in space on your front channel and rear channels speakers.  I don't recall hearing those small details back in 2000.  I felt the audio seemed cleaner and clearer in this deluxe edition.<br /><br />With a new digital remaster for the DVD coinciding with the 10th Anniversary of the film's release, I can only hope that we get a 1080p High Definition transfer with lossless audio.  Knock on wood, I hope there will be a Blu-ray release coming soon!<br /><br />But for now, compared to the original DVD release, this is the better DVD version to own for now in terms of picture and audio quality.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"Galaxy Quest - Deluxe Edition" comes with newer special features to celebrate the film's 10th Anniversary.  The original DVD released in 2000 had special DVD Easter Eggs (related to the Omega 13) and a "On Location in Space" featurette that are not included on this deluxe edition, so you may not want to throw out your original 2000 DVD.  But this Deluxe Edition comes with newer features recently created in 2009 and are very enjoyable.<br /><br />* Historical Documents: The Story of Galaxy Quest - (18:14) A new featurette with recent interviews with Dean Parisot (Director), Bob Gordon (Screenwriter) and David Howard (screenwriter).  Also, new interviews with the cast of "Galaxy Quest".  A fun and informative featurette of how the film came about, how the talent felt about being at a science fiction convention and being a bit weirded out by the experience and also certain segments that play homage to "Star Trek".<br />* Never Give Up. Never Surrender: The Intrepid Crew of the NSEA Protector - (23:25) This featurette goes into the casting of "Galaxy Quest".  The cast is interviewed and give their thoughts of their character and what they remember during the filming.  Interesting tidbits of Sigourney Weaver being in character once she had the blonde wig and attracting a lot of eyes.  How Alan Rickman was very cool and calm. Tim Allen and Daryl Mitchell always having fun on the set and really interesting situations that happened during the filming of "Galaxy Quest".<br />* By Grabthar's Hammer, What Amazing Effects - (7:03) How popular Stan Winston worked on special effects for the alien monsters and Industrial Light and Magic working on the CG effects.  How the camera work for "Galaxy Quest" was trying to recapture that Star Trek original series cinematography feel and much more!<br />* Alien School - Creating the Thermian Race - (5:23) How Enrico Colantoni (Mathesar) came up with the Thermian speech from vocal training they did at Yale.  How during "alien school", they would have to learn how to walk and move.<br />* Actors in Space - (6:11) In this segment, we learn how being in a popular series, an actor can get pigeonholed.  Tim Allen talks about people even today thinking he's Tim Taylor of "Home Improvement", Justin Long talking about despite his film work, he's still looked as "The Mac Guy", Daryl Mitchell known for his work on "House Party" and more.<br />* Sigourney Weaver Raps - (1:59) Sigourney Weaver's agent's birthday was coming up, so Sigourney asked Daryl Mitchell to help her create a rap for Sam Cohn and together with Sam Rockwell, Missi Pyle, Jed Rees, the five created a music video as a birthday present.<br />* Additional Scenes: Deleted Scenes (Used on 2000 release) - A total of eight deleted scenes.  Some of these features include commentary by the talent or Director Dean Parisot and David Howard.<br />* Thermian Audio Track - An audio track featured completely in Thermian.  Personally, even when this was on the original 2000 DVD, has anyone ever watched the film completely in Thermian?<br />* Theatrical Trailer (Used on 2000 release) - (1:54) Original theatrical trailer.<br /><br />The slip cover has a front cover that features Alan Rickman, Sigourney Weaver and Tim Allen in character, standing cool and collected (the image shown above on this review) and when you shift the front of the cover slightly, it shows the three firing their weapons.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />"Galaxy Quest - Deluxe Edition" is definitely a wonderful 10th Anniversary release.<br /><br />I have never grown tired of this film and for any Star Trek fan or science fiction fan, you can't help but enjoy and laugh and be thoroughly entertained by the various talent and the overall wackiness of the storyline.<br /><br />The new special features is what makes this film worth buying again on DVD.  To have everyone return for an interview and talk about their love for the film and how well it was received and how it has become a sci-fi classic was just fun to watch.  And the behind-the-scenes tidbits you learn about the shenanigans that went behind-the-scenes to the actual creation of the film, was also informative and entertaining.<br /><br />If there is one thing that I can hope for, that would be a high definition Blu-ray release of this film.  With its 10th Anniversary, I was a bit surprised that only a new DVD was announced at this time.  But with the film now receiving a new digital remastering, I can only hope for a HD 1080p transfer and lossless audio, to me, that would be the icing on the cake.<br /><br />But overall, this new deluxe edition was just fantastic and if you are a big fan of "Galaxy Quest", on DVD, this is the definitive version to own.  Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Matrix meets V for Vendetta"></head><body><p>Aeon Flux sheds light on the last human city following a virus that nearly killed off humankind 400 years earlier.  Having been in the hands of the Goodchild dynasty for centuries, the city of Bregna is slipping out of control as insurgents use assassins to kill off the settlement's leadership.  One lone assassin, however, will discover something that will shake the very foundations of society more than any mere assassination...<br /><br />There are strong hints of the Matrix and V for Vendetta so the movie falls into the sci-fi/action/adventure/mystery type of category.<br /><br />Charlize Theron (who is GORGEOUS!) and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the music, the battle sequences, and the special effects are all wonderful!<br /><br />Though not a masterpiece, Aeon Flux will surely provide for an evening's entertainment, as it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over!</p></body></html>

While channel surfing, you come across a movie on cable you haven't seen in years--often several years.  You are only surfing due to boredom, or you are fleeing from another show's commercial break; in any event, you are only going to surf for a few minutes, then go about the business of your day or evening.  You have no intention of altering your plans. . .until you come across that Good Flick.<br /><br />Yep.  DIE HARD is one of those.  Who hasn't seen this movie?  More than once?  We're all familiar with the story:  blue collar New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) suddenly finds himself in a strained long distance marriage, with his voluptuous wife (Bonnie Bedelia) now employed at a brand new LA high rise.  During a Yuletide visit to the tower (an office Christmas party) the building is suddenly seized by snarling Euro terrorists--while McClane is able to sneak, undetected, to the upper floors still under construction.  From there, he wreaks the havoc all DIE HARD fans have come to know and love, then utters an immortal "Yippee-kie-yay" epithet as the bad guys go down.  Yes, it's all silly and farfetched; yet Willis is as likeable as he is self-deprecating ("Come out to the west coast," he deadpans as he crawls through a ventilation shaft under machine gun fire, "have a few laughs. . ."), and there is not a better villain in all the cinematic land than Alan Rickman.  We even get to hate a  snotty, arrogant reporter (William Atherton).<br /><br />Forget the plethora of sequels; they're all nonsense supreme and merely take the McClane character to cartoon proportions.  Go with the original DIE HARD; it's darn fun to watch, and worth stopping what you're doing to take in on cable.  Yes, this flick passes the test.<br />--D.

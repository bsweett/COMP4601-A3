<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Adaptation of the 1941 Classic"></head><body><p>Horror buffs, you don't want to miss this excellent adaptation of the 1941 Universal Studios classic.  Stellar performances by Benicio Del Toro (Lawrence Talbot), Anthony Hopkins (his father) and Emily Blunt (his love interest), make this a millennium classic from the get-go.  Be sure to see it on the big screen.  I spilled my popcorn three times (thank goodness I bought the large refillable box).  And many kudos to the movie sets and costumes of 1891 England.  But, please don't bring the kids.  It's rated "R" for all the right reasons (horror fans that is).  There's lots of flesh-ripping gore and up-front out-of-the dark terror.  The tragic storyline will remind of you of another horror classic - "King Kong".  If you recall (without giving away the plot), the last line in the original Kong was:  "It wasn't the planes that got him, it was beauty that killed the beast."  All 5 stars.  We need more true horror films like this.</p></body></html>

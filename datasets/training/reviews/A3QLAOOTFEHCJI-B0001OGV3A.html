Sacrilege I know, but I was curious as to how they would do this.  Very well indeed.  In addition, I learned a few things that were always confusing.  For one thing, what's with the title?  In one scene we learn that the stunning Ziyi Zhang is Hidden Dragon, so I will presume that Michelle Yeoh is Crouching Tiger.  The movie ultimately is about the two women warriors and their great love affairs...no not with each other.  Set somewhere in the late Qing Dynasty (1880"s?), Yu Shu Lien (Yeoh) is part of the secretive underworld society of Jiang Hu.  The other major role is that of Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) a fabled Wudang swordsman.  They have a history of unrequited love due to the fact that Shu Lien had been engaged to Mu Bai's best friend who was murdered trying to protect him.  One of my favorite fight scenes ever occurs early in the film when Shu Lien chases down Jen Yu (Zhang) who had stolen a sword belonging to Mu Bai.  The scene is not brutal, but a poetic ballet done to the tom toms of Tan Dun.  It is quite hypnotic.  Some have snickered at the tree fights but I see these as elements of fantasy, no different than many movies.  In most cases the actors actually performed these wire stunts in the trees themselves.  While the primary love story is one of halting words and longing glances, the other gets a bit more physical with Jen Yu foregoing an arranged aristocratic marriage for a relationship with a macho desert bandit.  The many fight sequences are choreographed by famed Yuen Wo-Ping who did "The Matrix" among other films.  Yo Yo Ma adds his cello work to one of the greatest soundtracks ever.  This remains one of my favorite films of all time.  Its elegant, graceful love story has no faults.</p></body></html>

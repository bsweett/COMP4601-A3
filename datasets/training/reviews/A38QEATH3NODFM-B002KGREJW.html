<meta name="summary" content="An interesting comedy,  functioning dysfunction."></head><body><p>An interesting film that was not released on a large in theaters, little miss sunshine is a film that is likely to be seen big on the awards stages in the next few months.  Its path will be similar to that of the film "sideways" a couple of years ago.  An interesting view into a dysfunctional family that again proves that dysfunction can function if given the right ingredients.  Although the dysfunctional family has been played out on film many a time (eg. National lampoon Vacation series of film), this film took a little darker humor, not so overboard with outrageous stunts or even nudity. Yes, some aspect (bringing dead grandpa along) may be a bit off, at least they didn't do a weekend at bernies type script. They worked it in just the once (highway patrol stop), and they didn't do it till the end. I did think the ending was predictable (the routine produced by grandpa), but it was funny.  I would expect at least a few nominations at the golden globes and oscars, and hopefully it will take home a couple. Greg Kinnear does well, and Steve Carrell was great.  Check this one out.</p></body></html>

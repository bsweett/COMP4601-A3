<meta name="summary" content="Smith's DOGMA is a Hellva of Good Time"></head><body><p>Writer/director Kevin Smith's all star,religious socal commentary is a HOOT to watch, and draws on religion points. Its funny and full of satire. Smith and his cast pokes their collective fingers in your religious eyes and makes you laugh<br /><br />If you listen to the audio commenraries, this film was made on a shoestring-with the shortness of the budget, the  casting problems, location problems and the scheduling around things(Oscars, Revlon shoots, other movies)-The film might not have been made<br /><br />Smith pokes fun at religion without bad mouthing it. His premous is simple. The great great grand daughter (last known descendant) of Jesus, two unlikely prophets (Jay & Silent Bob), and the 13th Apostle  Rufus are  sent on a mission to save humanity  by stopping two wayward angels from entering a newly openned portal to heaven. Okay, Complex simple!<br /><br />The cast of this film is first rate... Ben Affleck and Matt Damon as the two wayward angels, Linda Fiorentino as the last known descendant of Jesus, Jason Mews  and Smith as Jay and Silent Bob, Chris Rock as Rufus, Alan (Die Hard, Harry Potter) Rickman as Metatron, Jason (My Name is Earl)Lee as Azreal, Salma Hayek as the Muse, George Carlin as Cardinal Glick and Alanis Morissette as GOD<br /><br />This special edition DVD includes many deleted scenes about 100 minutes worth, almost as long as  the film itself, outtakes, Cast film biographies like trading cards and the trailer to the film.<br /><br />So is this worth it? YUP and AMEN<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD</p></body></html>

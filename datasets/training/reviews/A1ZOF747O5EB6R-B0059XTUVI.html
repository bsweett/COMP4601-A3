She regarded it as a compliment.<br /><br />"The Iron Lady" provides a biography of Margaret Thatcher's adult life.  The highlight of this life, of course, was her more than a decade a Britain's first female prime minister.  The film covers this as a series of flash backs as seen the through the eyes of a very aged former prime minister.  The technique works.  Her life has certainly been quite extraordinary although there is little focus on her weaknesses.  In this sense, the film almost becomes hagiography.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the apparent lack of blemishes in the character of the former prime minister, Meryl Streep, in playing the older Margaret Thatcher, is spell binding.  Moreover, Streep is simply magnificent. Her performance is my early call for an Oscar. She really does become Margaret Thatcher.  There are no apparent flaws.  The accent, in particular, is right on the money.<br /><br />Streep is supported by Jim Broadbent as Dennis.  Unfortunately, his role tends to fall almost to caricature at times.  This is a shame as there are a number of other cameo roles and most of these are played excellently.  Michael Foot, Geoffrey Howe, Michael Heseltine, et al are played in absolutely convincing style by a great supporting cast.  The various sets and the manner in which the era of the 1980s is re-created is also first class.<br /><br />In sum, apart from the danger of hagiography, this is a great film led by an actress at the top of her form.

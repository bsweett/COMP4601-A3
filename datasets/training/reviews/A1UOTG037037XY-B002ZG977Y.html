<meta name="summary" content="misuse of closeups and mumbling by Liam Neeson and Voldemort really detract from the viewing experience"></head><body><p>This movie is totally different from the original Harry Hamlin movie so it's important to just separate from nostalgia and loyalty to give this film a fair shake.  But the mistakes in camera closeups and the mumbling of Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are irritating.  Also, wearing a beard while mumbling as both these actors do give the effect of chewing on dryer lint.  I need closed captioning to follow this film so I can't imagine this was a pleasant movie theater experience.  I found this movie unwatchable but I get the message that the Greeks used mythology as an evolutionary tool to inspire literacy, imagination and moral foundation.  Once society had reached an aspirational plateau, these myths/gods were no longer necessary for daily life and just became Beautiful Stories for Children (not just the Ugly ones as authored by Dan Sweetman.)</p></body></html>

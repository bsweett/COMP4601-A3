Anything that can cause emotion is to be exterminated or taken in for investigation such as art, books, music, and people with knowledge of feelings.  The people are controlled by Prozium, a mind-numbing medication that controls emotions.  However, when Cleric John Preston (Christian Bale) loses his partner and repressed memories begin to haunt his sleep, he decides to see what happens if he does not take the Prozium.  Equilibrium is a dark film about a possible future that promotes thoughts about our current freedoms in the western world; however, it also offers some action packed sequences that will keep the sleepy awake.  In the end, Equilibrium offers a solid cinematic experience.</p></body></html>

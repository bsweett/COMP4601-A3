It has been done in comic book form, but I really wanted the big movie story.  I was actually a bit disappointed by this movie.  I think Bale is a fine choice as leader of the resistance, though he didn't really do as much with the role as I would have liked.  I also thought that the world that had endured a nuclear war and the rising of machines should have looked much more desolate and grim.  The first two movies show a world that is shattered and dark.  The story is okay, though much of it feels like a set up for a sequel that may or may not come based on the low box office take.  Good action sequences make this interesting throughout despite many short comings.</p></body></html>

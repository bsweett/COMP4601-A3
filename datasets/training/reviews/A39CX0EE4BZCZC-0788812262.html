<meta name="summary" content="Overall, I Can See Why This Is So Beloved"></head><body><p>It took me 40 years before I finally saw this film, in December 2004 shortly after it had come out with a two-disc DVD. After the first half hour I thought, "Wow, I can see why this is such a beloved movie" but after that it started to lag in a number of areas and the songs were just too numerous. It seemed to go on way too long.<br /><br /> Yet, it's a good film worthy of anyone's collection and the DVD transfer is very good: nice rich colors and reasonably sharp for a now 45- year-old film. There are some nice extras in here, too.  Andrews is wholesomely pretty and Glynis Johns, even with her strange voice, also is appealing. The kids are kind of stupid-looking, as are their parents.<br /><br />The other major character, the chimney sweep played by Dick Van Dyke, is a likable chap, but hard to understand with this cockney impression. However, on the DVD, one can use the English subtitles when he speaks. Van Dyke surprised me with his singing and dancing talent. I didn't know he was that proficient.<br /><br />The movie was one of the first efforts at mixing real life with animation and they did it well. It still holds up today.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable, but too many mutants and some odd plot choices"></head><body><p>I enjoyed the X-men comic books since I was a kid.  Apparently, they became something else after I stopped reading comics in my mid-teens.  The first couple of these movies were pretty fun and this one provides the big battle Magneto has been aiming at for quite awhile.<br /><br />What I don't like about this movie is the sheer number of mutants.  I mean, there are so many of them by what definition could they be mutations?  And since all their powers seem more or less unique, what in the world could be happening genetically (which is more about conserving useful traits)?<br /><br />Anyway, the mutants go to war because the government has come up with a "cure" that suppresses the mutant's mutantness.  And while some mutants want to take this cure, others feel that it is wrong to cure any of them because it is tantamount to admitting that being a mutant means something is wrong with you.  We see this in real life with a movement working against the notion that it would be a blessing to provide them with hearing.  There are other aspects that the X-Men movies allude to none to subtly that I will not comment on except to note that we all know it is there.<br /><br />The big scenes are all quite spectacular and there are lots and lots and lots of mutants with some cool and some silly powers.  This whole cure thing has some odd effects and it isn't only the tangential characters that get whacked in this one.<br /><br />So, enjoy!  But don't expect to get too much in the way of character development.  And you might want to throw a rubber brick at the screen for some of the plot twists chosen.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another breakout role"></head><body><p>Most child actors make their big break starring in children's movies.  Chloe Moretz has done the exact opposite; though she has a string of children's movies on her resume already, she has made her name among the American movie-going public by starring in a bloody horror flick and a vulgar, bloody action flick; both of which are rated R.  And to her credit, both of these movies are probably among the best releases of 2010.  This one, a remake of a Swedish film of a similar name and plot, has Chloe portraying a 12-year old female vampire who develops a relationship with a bullied boy in a small town somewhere in America during the dead of winter.  Her acting is quite impressive, with scenes of romance, action, suspense and drama mixed together.  Her acting is accompanied by good acting by the rest of the cast, most of which, like her, are relative unknowns in Hollywood.  The movie itself is scary and entertaining to watch.  Overall, one of the better films of 2010.  One final comment about her breakout role; she is following a successful path; Jodie Foster, Drew Barrymore and Christian Bale made their names by starring in rated-R movies as children.</p></body></html>

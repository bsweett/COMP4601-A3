<meta name="summary" content="A hilarious, action-packed sci-fi thrill ride"></head><body><p>Campy yet clever, Men in Black is just a whale of an entertaining movie, sporting all kinds of great action, some surprisingly good dialogue, fine acting by Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, and a small galaxy full of laughs.  It is actually a little surprising to me that it took so long for Hollywood to make a movie spoofing the infamous Men in Black, mysterious entities who reportedly intervene on occasion in the lives of those having just made significant UFO or alien sightings.  The only thing that should stop anyone from enjoying this movie is a chronic inability to suspend one's disbelief and just sit back and enjoy something meant as pure entertainment and nothing else.<p>The plot isn't that complicated.  Aliens of all sorts have been around for ages on earth, and the public is kept ignorant of their existence because, as Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) says, a person may be smart but people are dumb and would panic if their self-absorbed fantasy reality were to be pulled out from under their feet.  One organization, the Men in Black, makes sure that earthlings are kept in the dark and that visiting aliens are kept in check.  Will Smith plays a New York City cop who unknowingly impresses a top MIB agent by chasing down a disguised cephalopod on foot.  The future Agent J (Smith) is not your typical MIB recruit, espousing some disregard for authority, making light of all kinds of situations, and generally just making everything he says and does hilarious.  He shows up for an "entrance test" even after having his memory of a most mind-expanding night's events "flashing-thingied" out of his head, but he doesn't really buy the whole concept of aliens until he sees some little extraterrestrial Cheech and Chong-type fellows inside MIB headquarters.  His first two days on the job are, to say the least, eventful.  A big bad alien bug has landed illegally in upstate New York with designs on stealing a galaxy belonging to a visiting royal family member from another planet, and the fate of Earth hangs in the balance as the offended alien race demands their galaxy be returned to them.  <p>One thing I really like about Men in Black is the fact that some of the funniest bits happen outside the main focus of the shot - nothing tops the scene in which, in the background, we watch Agent J attempt to help deliver a non-human baby.  I also got a kick out of seeing executive producer Steven Spielberg subtly identified as an alien.  A number of easy-to-miss references of this type are imbedded in the film, making multiple viewings interesting as well as entertaining. <p>There are plenty of special effects throughout the movie.  The aliens are all done quite nicely (and there is enough exploding bug goo to satisfy just about anyone), while a few of the Batman-type effects have a campy look and feel to them; I actually think campy was the way to go because this movie was not made to be taken too seriously.  The dialogue is actually quite good, I think, including some witty pop culture references, and Tommy Lee Jones' deadpan delivery is the perfect counterpoint to the infectious humor of Will Smith.  Smith has played this type of character before, and no one does it better.  The man is just funny, and it is his performance that made this summertime release such a successful, quintessential summer blockbuster.</p></body></html>

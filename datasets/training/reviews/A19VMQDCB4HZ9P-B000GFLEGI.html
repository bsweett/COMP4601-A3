<meta name="summary" content="A worthy installment to Romero's classic Dead Saga"></head><body><p>I've seen it twice now and the first time I saw it as a Romero-fanboy. The second time it was with a more critical eye. I have to say that overall the film succeeds in what Romero was trying to accomplish. This is especially true in the fact that the film was his very first studio-financed zombie film. That shows in the overall look and pace of the film. I can't fault Romero for that since it allowed him to make the film when no one else would dare touch him with a 100-foot pole. The uncut and unrated DVD will probably show the definitive Land of the Dead, but as a theatrical studio film this fourth entry in the Dead series succeeds more than it failed.<br /><br />First, the gore-factor in the film is more than I thought the MPAA would have allowed Romero, Nicotero and the boys at KNB FX would get away with. I think I can see where a few Romero-fans would have been disappointed in terms of what was showed after Romero's last two: Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead. Those two films raised the bar in terms of gore and splatter on the screen. This is especially true with Day of the Dead. But for an R-rated film Land of the Dead matches and surpasses what Saving Private Ryan showed in terms of on-screen carnage. The second time I saw the film I could tell where Romero had to pan or cut away before the gore became too over-the-top. Another trick I saw him do was (which I was prepared to look for after Greg Nicotero's AICN interview) was to have zombies walk across the scene in front of a feeding frenzy to minimize some of the effect. I am anxious to see what they cut-out to gain the R how it'll fit with the overall look and feel of the film when its put back for the DVD.<br /><br />Second, the story itself is typical Romero in that it was a reflection of what he sees going on in the world at this moment, but with zombies to complicate things. To say that Romero is not a huge fan of the current administration is an understatement. Right from the beginning Land of the Dead is a commentary on Bush and company's approach on the War on Terror. Romero also uses the film as a way to point out the widening gap between the class structure in the United States. He's pretty much sledgehammer-like in his commentary. There's Kaufmann and his elite caste (which seemed to be white and affluent) living their life as if the zombie apocalypse that forced them into Fiddler's Green never occurred. Then you have the other castes which includes not just the grunts who are doing the dirty and dangerous jobs to keep everyone at the Green provided and satisfied, but the people who are deemed not Green-type: people who do not have the wealth and correct racial make-up. Then to complicate things there's an even larger caste just waiting to come in just beyond the electrified and guarded fence and the riverbanks. Romero's a child of the 60's revolutionary movement and his past zombie films' message points this out. This time around it comes out with less subtlety but with more force as if Romero knows that his kind of filmmaker are a dying breed and that this may be one of the last times he can send his message across through his film.<br /><br />Finally, we come to the characters and most especially the zombies themselves. The zombie make-up effects done by Greg and KNB are to-notch and raises the bar on make-up effects overall. The zombies they've come up with look like what zombie would look if they've been moving around for years out in the elements. A few seem to have a much intact and less decayed look while some look to be more like walking, dried-out corpses. Either way Nicotero and team made great use of make-up and judicious use of CGI to give the zombies their best look to date. The human characters are pretty much sketched out according to who the good guys and bad guys would be. Riley as the main human hero is serviceable and Hopper as Kaufmann is less over-the-top than what most people would be used to when they think Dennis Hopper. In fact, Hopper portrays the ruthless Fiddler's Green executive with a certain Rumsfeld-esque and Cheney-esque approach. This is a person who thinks that people should be glad that he's in charge to make their lives easier and safer from not just the zombies but from each other. He's a poster-boy for the mindset that if the populace is entertained and placated with the trappings of the old life then they wouldn't complain of the problems that exist outside their borders. Sounds similar to a certain mindset a certain nation is in right now.<br /><br />I must point out a couple of standouts in the film in the supporting characters of Charlie and Pillsbury. They're the comedy relief but not in the rip-roaring laugh-my-ass off funny, but in the way veterans of a war will joke and act to keep themselves sane and on the straight and narrow. Charlie seems to be the Lenny to Riley's George and the chemistry between Simon baker and Robert Joy works. Pillsbury was just on time with what little dialogue he had but right from the beginning the audience liked this character and I'm sure joined me in hoping he didn't become zombie-chow.<br /><br />The zombie-hero characters are a little harder to describe. I know of people who were tuned off by their continuing evolution to something resembling human instead of the flesh-eating corpses that they were. Big Daddy's introduction as the de facto leader of the zombies in the film seemed abit rushed, but unlike some I thought his evolution was a continuation with what Romero began with Bub in Day of the Dead. One thing that I noticed that few missed was the fact that even though Big Daddy was still a zombie who was smarter than most he never partook in any of the flesh-eating from beginning to end. The same goes for the handful of zombies who really began learning from Big Daddy's example like The Butcher and Softball Player (number 9 as she is called in the credits). the rest of the zombies mimicked what Big Daddy was doing, but in the end their primal instinct to feed overrode whatever residual behavior they were learning. I thought this was something lost to most audiences and almost lost to me until I saw the film a second time and things began to click into place. There will always be zombies that gorehounds love for their ability to just feed-frenzy whenever they catch a living human, but interspersed among them will be the evolving "Bubs" who seem to want to be left alone. Does this mean that these "Bubs" will stop feeding on humans probably not, but they're not as mindless and emotionless as the majority of their brethren will remain as.<br /><br />Overall, the film is an entertaining one if seen as a stand-alone. It's not as scary as the previous three in the series, but the films have progressively been getting less scary since Night of the Living Dead. The film seen as part of the series succeeds in continuing Romero's vision of what the zombies are. That they're not the real monsters in his film but just a reminder that they really are just us and their ability to collectively work together has always been their secret to always succeeding in finding a way into whatever defense humans have put up to keep them out. It is this working together that the surviving humans cannot learn and thus leads to their downfall. The title fits in that the land really belongs to the zombies now and the surviving humans are just temporarily living in it. I am not too big of a fan at what one of the characters did in the end, but it does show that with an evolving enemy out there the old ways of dealign with them may have to end and a new one found if humanity is to truly survive. I would give this film an overall score of 9 out of 10.</p></body></html>

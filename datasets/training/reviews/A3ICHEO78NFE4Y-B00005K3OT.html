<meta name="summary" content="Just a GREAT movie."></head><body><p>Juliette Binoche,,,,now she is an actress. She's beautiful, sincere, very believable and most important she has talent!  Something american actors and hollywood knows nothing about.  But i digress,,,,,This movie has a great story, great music, great visuals, a few surprises, an actress from the past and the movie flys by because you get so involved in the story. The transfer to DVD is also very good.  The sound is strong and highlights the movie perfectly. Well done!  I was impressed.</p></body></html>

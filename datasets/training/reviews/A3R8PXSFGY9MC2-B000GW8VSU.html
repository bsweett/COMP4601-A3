<meta name="summary" content="The Manchurian Candidate"></head><body><p>I was aware of the basic premise of this film before watching it and not having seen the original I didn't come to this with any preconceptions. With that in mind, this is a fairly decent thriller movie, that although slow paced, still manages to keep you interested for the duration. The story has been updated for this remake to take into account modern conflicts and scientific developments, but the key idea remains the same. A US soldier is brainwashed to commit a political assassination when he returns home. The film is based around this basic idea and also how to uncover the plot and motivation behind it. Washington turns out a decent performance and Streep, whilst being a parody of the evil domineering mother, still manages to be fairly convincing. Liev Shrieber is the last part of the acting puzzle who manages to lift this film from mediocrity to something half decent. This has flaws aplenty and as I mentioned before it is slow paced and dragged in places, but it still a reasonable film and worth a watch at some point. It has made me want to see the original to see if it as good (and as superior to this version) as I have heard.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

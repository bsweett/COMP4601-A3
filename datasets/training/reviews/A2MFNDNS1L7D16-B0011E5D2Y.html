<meta name="summary" content="It  earned its R rating"></head><body><p>I went for rhe extra unrated 81/2 minutes on the dvd. It's a great adult if not always mature movie. In fact you might say it's charming. Owen Wilson as John & Vince Vaughn as Jeremy certainly are. Lots of cameos such as James Carville & John McCain seemingly together in the background of a wedding<br />scene. Jane Seymore has a small part as the horny mother of the bride. I've always liked her, especially topless.<br />  John & Jeremy crash weddings. Lots of them. They have it down to a science & take great pride in doing it well, that is without getting caught. They even have a book of rules that are scared & not to be violated. The object? To get laid. There are lots of unattached young ladies who are caught up in the strong romantic emotions that weddings evoke, waiting to be plucked.<br />Secretary of the Treasury William Cleary, played by Christopher Walken, is having a big wedding for one of his daughters & it promises to be the social event of the summer.  John & Jeremy have had a sucessful season & this would be the topper.<br />  You may guess what happens. They break the most important rule: Do not fall in love. Worse, they fall in love with secretary Cleary's daughters. It is fast paced, funny, sexy humor. Lots of profanity, which doesn't really detract. A universal theme most prople have thought of doing a one time or another. Enjoy.</p></body></html>

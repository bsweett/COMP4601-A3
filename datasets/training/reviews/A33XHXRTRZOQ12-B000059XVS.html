<meta name="summary" content="The Great O'Toole's first big movie...."></head><body><p>Peter O'Toole has spent the last 28 years wasting his talent in totally mediocre films not up to his gift as an actor. He's been in a total of maybe TWO films that had any kind of patina of class at ALL, ("My Favorite Year" and "The Last Emperor", the latter by the repugnant Bernardo Bertolucci,) the rest have been totally missable pieces of fluff or outright stinkers. But THIS film is what started it for him... a run of more than twenty years of some of the best movies ever made.<br /><br />I am a big fan of that O'Toole, the O'Toole that starred ONLY in exceptional films, like "The Lion In Winter", "What's New Pussycat", "The Ruling Class", "Great Catharine", etc., and revisiting this film makes it all obvious why. Like I've said before, O'Toole is one of the two "crown princes of intense", the other being Richard Burton, and he gives us a good preview of his style here.<br /><br />This is the story of Thomas Edward Lawrence, (who O'Toole resembles not one whit,) the British officer who helped the Arabs liberate themselves from Turkish rule. It shows the stoicness of spirit and the fiery resolve Lawrence had to bring  off his goal successfully. It shows the devotion the Arabs he befriended had for him. Lawrence BECAME an Arab to lead these men, who had become moribund, thinking that their cause was hopeless.<br /><br />Anthony Quinn, Alec Guinness, Jose Ferrer and Omar Sharif, (in what was also HIS first movie,) acquit themselves decently as Turkish and Arab chieftains and bigwigs, with Guinness portraying a rather unconvincing King Feisal, and Quinn sporting the most OBVIOUS prosthetic nose I've ever seen in the movies.<br /><br />This film wrote the book on grand scale and scope as it displays scene after scene of confrontations both mano a mano and battles with a cast of thousands, all of it brought off very realistically. The cinematography is excellent, the art direction realistic, (this was one of the first "dirt-under-the-fingernails" period movies to be shown, along with "Taras Bulba", both in the early sixties,) and the acting almost perfect! If you want to see one of the last of the great epic films, (for this surely WAS one of the last to actually MEAN anything,) rent or buy this great film, the first big film for O'Toole and the VERY first international film for Omar Sharif!<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

To some extent, if you've seen one of these (especially the ur-heist film "Rififi"), you've seen them all.  Hey, if you've ever watched a movie, you know that when a master thief makes "one last score" before retirement, things are going to go horribly wrong.  It's just like being a cop in a movie two weeks before retirement.  "The Italian Job" does not transcend any expectations, but it doesn't fail to meet any of them, either.  The performances are good, and the script makes as much sense as you would expect it to.  The action sequences are well-done, and there are enough car chases to remind you of the Golden Age of car chases in the 70s and early 80s.  In the end, while it is a decent movie, there is really nothing memorable about it, other than the cars.  "The Italian Job" is a decent rental; you will likely not be disappointed, and you may even have a good time with it.  But it's just not distinctive or memorable enough to add to your permanent collection.</p></body></html>

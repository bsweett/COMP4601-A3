Their life is one of discipline, relentless hard work, and sacrifice, all for the sake of a career that has, in most cases, a very short shelf life. What drives them?<br /><br />"Black Swan" attempts to get inside the mind of a ballerina, while also creating a trippy, often erotic thriller that even mainstream audiences (not just art movie snobs) can enjoy. It's a tightrope, but Darren Aronofsky pulls it all off brilliantly, making his best film since "Requiem for a Dream", with the help of lead actress Natalie Portman, who gives the most impressive performance in her young career (already full of some impressive performances).<br /><br />Portman plays Nina, a workaholic ballerina who seems finally ready to ascend to the lead role in "Swan Lake". Although, with her virginal demeanor, the slightly sadistic director thinks she'll make a perfect White Swan, he criticizes her for lacking the darkness and sexuality needed to play the role of the Black Swan. In order to give the perfect performance, tightly wound Nina needs to find the Black Swan in her, and she knows she won't find it through the hard work and discipline she usually employs.<br /><br />And so it begins. The stress of finally dancing the lead in a production, coupled with Nina's drive to find the darkness within herself that she's been repressing her entire life, send her on a mental downward spiral. The film plays it all ambiguously, and it's often not clear whether what is happening is real or all in Nina's head. Even the characters around her (her stage mother, the free-spirited rival ballerina, the enraged elder ballerina Nina is replacing) can often be interpreted not as real people but as personifications of parts of Nina's own fractured psyche.<br /><br />Part portrait of a tortured young artist, part erotic thriller, and part head trip, "Black Swan" is one of the best films of the year, and the best thriller I've seen in a long time. Bravo.</p></body></html>

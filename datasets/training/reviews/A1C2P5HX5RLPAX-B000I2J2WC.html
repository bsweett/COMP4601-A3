<meta name="summary" content="Watch Movie then Read Book"></head><body><p>Had I not read the book I'm sure I would have enjoyed the movie more (probably no surprise here). I kept trying to anticipate what they would do next and ended up disappointed when things were left out. This does not make it a bad movie. I'm confirming it is difficult to enjoy after reading the book.<br /><br />The movie attempts to be as faithful as it can in the three hours allotted. I didn't mind most of the character choices. I had read some complaints about Tom Hanks in the role but I found him believable and acceptable. Ian McKellan is always an excellent villain and his portrayal of Sir Leigh Teabing is no different. Audrey Tautou is quite the shapeshifter in her roles. As Sophie she is soft with an underlying strength required for her character. But I didn't feel the chemistry the book has between her and Langton. Paul Bettany (forever my Chaucer) who plays the albino Silas was a bit of a disappointment to me. Even his whitening makeup was obvious in some scenes and the trademark eyes were missing.<br /><br />A very important scene at the end where Sophie reunites with her brother was not included. I think this was a pivotal reunion for Sophie's character. Her reunion with her grandmother was also anticlimactic. Sophie played a very small role in the discovery of the grail other than providing a personal history. I remember her being a stronger character academically and more involved in the code cracking in the book.<br /><br />Overall, it was a good movie. Mystery, action, history, intrigue and the continual battle of good against evil. Entertaining.</p></body></html>

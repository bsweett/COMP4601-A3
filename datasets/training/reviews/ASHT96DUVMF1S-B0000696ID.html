This Limited Edition Collection is a must for Collectors.  They will stop producing it after the new year. An almost flawless transfer gives a bright picture and great colors.  Their is a lot of special features along with the Live performance of John Williams conducting at the 2002 premiere.  I liked the 1982 version better without the new computer animation of ET.  Overall this is one of the better DVD's to come out in the last several months.</p></body></html>

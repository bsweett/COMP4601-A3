<meta name="summary" content="Not a patch on the original"></head><body><p>SAW was both original, exciting and thrilling whereas SAW 2 was a tad boring and tried to cash in on the original.  The key players are still in the film, but it's just too far fetched for its own good.  Nor are the scenes as grahpic as the first. I also found the house where the victims were held not creepy enough, whereas in the first film, the old industrial toilet was intensely creepy.<br /><br />SAW 2 failed also because I did not care about the characters.  I just wanted the film to end.<br /><br />See the original and marvel at that.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Well thought drama."></head><body><p>Well, I just caught this on DVD recently and I liked it. It was more drama than horror, but that's a good thing cause then if you save your horror for last, then it's better.<br /><br />This movie is about a Father who has a creepy (but cute) daughter. After the mom commits suicide in a bathtub one night, they move to a nice house in New york state. then one night, The girl develops an imaginary friend named Charlie. But Charlie starts to complicate the place...<br /><br />I thought this movie was cool. It had a nice twist ending and plus, the acting was great. So I think you should see it.<br /><br />Any psychological movie fan (or person who likes the weird and the wonderful) should see it. You'll like it!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not pleased with the movie..."></head><body><p>I was so disappointed in this movie.  It was obvious who Charlie was and there was so many questions I still had at the end that made me mad.  Such as what was up with the neighbor and why did both of them seem creepy for no reason?  Why did everyone always tell her she was so beautiful?  It got real annoying after a while because nothing came from that story line either.  And it was obvious who Charlie was from the middle of the movie.  I didn't like that I knew who he was.  I just felt this movie was lacking in a story the actors and actresses were fine the story was weak.  It tried to throw people off so it started story lines but never ended them--which is quite annoying leaving a movie going okay but why was this person doing this, etc. I was hoping for a good creepy movie but this movie did nothing for me and was a disappointment.</p></body></html>

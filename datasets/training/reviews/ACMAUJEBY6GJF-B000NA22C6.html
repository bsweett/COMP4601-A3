<meta name="summary" content="Not very good, and my expectations weren't that high..."></head><body><p>Johnny Depp is a good actor, but he doesn't "save" this movie, and frankly - in my opinion anyway - he did not deserve an Academy nomination for Pirates of the Carribian neither. He hasn't quite "convinsed" me yet, though I thought he was superb in Sleepy Hollow, he did a great job there.<br /><br />Well, Secret Window. This movie doesn't tempt me to open the Stephen King-book which it is based on. The story is so ungripping, and the end comes so sudden on you (in the movie anyway), and when I realized "the plot" the only thing I could say was : Is that all?<br /><br />A movie doesn't have to be perfect to be watchable, 3 stars means watchable and entertainig, but this movie really is a waste of time. Because of the ending of the movie I'm not sure if it deserves two stars even, but perhaps this is just my disappointment in the twelve dollars I just wasted on this sad attempt of a thriller.<br /><br />If you are a Johnny Depp-fan, you might enjoy it. Nothing's different about him here, he acts in the same old style - but unless you are a BIG fan, he probably isn't worth it in this one.</p></body></html>

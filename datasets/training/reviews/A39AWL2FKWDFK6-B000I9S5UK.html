<meta name="summary" content="A bloody modern day siege"></head><body><p>Ethan Hawke leads a well rounded cast starring as booze and drug dependent yet ethical Detroit police Sergeant Roenick in the action thriller "Assault on Precinct 13".  Eight months after a bungled drug bust in which he was wounded and two partners were killed, he finds himself in decommissioned precinct 13.  He was assigned the regretable job of manning the nearly barren station on New Years Eve, with old police veteran Jasper played by an aging Brian Dennehy and precinct miniskirted secretary Iris Ferry played by the sexy Drea DeMatteo.<br /><br />Concurrently big shot gangster Marion Bishop played authoritatively by Laurence Fishburne had been apprehended for a cop killing.  He was being transported by bus to a secure lockup with three other perps during a driving winter snowstorm.  With driving extremely treacherous the bus was ordered to wait out the storm at the deserted precinct 13.<br /><br />Much to the chagrin of all involved, Fishburne was in cohoots with a legion of rogue and dirty cops led by Gabriel Byrne playing Lt. Duvall.  Byrne and his minions could not allow Fishburne to reveal the details of their arrangement.  They aimed to silence Fishburne, Hawke and the others trapped in the precinct house using an Alamo-like siege to kill all those that could implicate them.<br /><br />This action packed thriller necessitated the collaboration of Hawke and Fishburne and all the cops and prisoners if they were to survive the attack.<br /><br />The acting performances were good for the most part, also featuring Maria Bello as a conflicted police psychologist and the immensely talented John Leguizamo playing the brain fried junkie Beck.</p></body></html>

Love"></head><body><p>The story is a hodgepodge that resembles"Logan's Run," "Running Out of Time," "Anna to the Infinite Power," and a tad of "Coma." I am sure you can think of others.<br /><br />Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) leads a sterile life and hope to win the lottery and go to the only pathogen free island. Unfortunately he has a propensity for snooping as all Six Echo's do. This will lead him to find an insidious secret and must escape his environment with his girlfriend Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) if he wants her to live. In fast pursuit is the institution manager who has an interest in some of Jordan Two Delta's parts.<br /><br />This is a great adventure as we learn about the outer world and cringes at the chase scenes.  Go ahead and kibitz, I did.  It is just possible they will not escape their fate.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004VVNB">Logan's Run</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0689812361">Running Out of Time by Margaret Peterson Haddix [Paperback</a>]<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00347ZYT8">Anna to the Infinite Power</a></p></body></html>

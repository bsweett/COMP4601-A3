It would appear that way with the super-natural thriller genre getting a serious kick in the pants over the past couple of years based on the number of projects, some have worked (The Ring) but for the most part audiences have come away disappointed by the far from quality Shyamalan's films were known for. Now with the now famous director's latest work, The Village, far from meeting fan expectations, could the door be open for a new one to take over now that essentially Shyamalan wants to move on to different projects? Already The Forgotten has labeled itself this year's The Sixth Sense, whether it be the rumors of this being a knock-off of the 1999 hit or studio enthusiasm, so whatever way it goes shouldn't be shocking, just as its finale is.<br /><br />The story for The Forgotten follows a grieving mother as she attempts to track down the truth about her eight year old son who was believed to have died in an airplane tragedy but now appears to have been part of an orchestrated cover up. Telly Paretta, like any parent would be in this situation, has never felt the same way since two years ago when her son Sam was killed in a tragic plane accident the killed five other children on their way to summer camp. Every day, for at least an hour, she slips back into her son's room, looks at old scrapbooks and watches videos of him through his short-lived childhood, thus keeping a part of her son alive - his memory. When she discovers that the videos have been erased and the scrapbooks emptied, she becomes furious at her husband who she claims wants their son forgotten from their life so that they can move on. But her psychiatrist reveals to her that Telly and her husband never had a son, or at least a living one, as she miscarried and nearly died after giving birth to their still born son. He states that it is normal for a woman in this situation to create imaginary children and friends to fill the void that has been lost in their life. Telly refuses to belief this and runs off searching for a man whose daughter was friends with her son before the crash. When he comes to realization that he had a daughter, the two run off together in search of the truth while being constantly pursued by National Security attempting to cover up a conspiracy they don't want dug up. The story for The Forgotten is quite simply one of the most pathetic and miserable scripts created for a feature film, not sent direct to video, this year. To be fair, the first one-third of the film in which Telly is told by her psychiatrist that she may be psychotic, specifically making up a child in her mind to deal with the miscarriage, was an intriguing piece of work and may have kept the interest of audience had the screenwriters followed through with that premise. Unfortunately The Forgotten, much in the same way as another horror rip-off, Godsend, earlier this year, decides to veer so severely off course from reality that you are left with more questions by the end then when you started off.<br /><br />The film has a perfectly assembled cast, , unfortunately all that priceless talent is wasted in this hopeless tripe of a film. Julianne Moore, better known for her brilliant performances in more independent fare like The Shipping News and Far From Heaven, gives tremendous emotion to the character of Telly Paretta, a woman who will do anything just to have her son back in her life. Her specific actions and moods will connect instantly with parents while those not yet blessed with a child in their lives may struggle to accept some of the events occurring but will at least understand them. Dominic West, a rising up and comer in Hollywood, does an exceptional job with the role of man who's practically sent his life down a drunken spiral ever since he lost his daughter in what supposedly a tragic plane accident. Applause must be given to the screenwriters for getting at least one thing right in this script and that was for Moore and West's characters to have an intense relationship together but not have them collapse into yet another pathetic "romantic" escapade as in other films of this genre. Alfre Woodard and Anthony Edwards are two support characters that could have easily been down-sized based on their roles in the feature or completely eliminated altogether as they do little, if anything seriously, to the progression of the story. And Gary Sinise, now known as the star of the recently launched CSI: New York series on the C-BS television network, does the best he can with the material that is given to him but unfortunately for him the character is seriously flawed. Without giving too much away, though, to be honest, there's too much confusion to clearly give anything away in this film, Sinise's character knows of the "experiment" going on near the end of the film but states he isn't a government agent, just a guy who knows. Then why wasn't he abducted? Is he one of "them"? What is his specific role in this cover up? These are just a few of the absurdly large amount of unanswered questions poised at the end of this film that may never be answered.<br /><br />Overall, The Forgotten is by no means, in any shape or form, this year's The Sixth Sense, though it does share a trait with another Shymalan film, The Village, namely that the audience feels cheated in part to its cheap thrills but mainly for an ending that feels ripped an old episode of either The Twilight Zone or The X-Files. There will be those out there who want others to believe that this film is a wonderful send up to the classic B-movie science-fiction thrillers of the 1950s but, as illogical as those films were, they never contained plot holes as gigantic as the ones that occupy The Forgotten's premise. How is it that the Telly is the sole obsession of this "alien life form" conducting this experiment and not Ash as well? Though it did take a little coaching, he did remember his daughter nearly as well as Telly remembers Sam. Granted he was eventually abducted but still doesn't he get a little credit in all this? Though mothers do share a much closer relationship with their children then do the fathers, which can not be denied, the film's ending is a bit of an insult to fathers who care deeply for their children and would do just as much as the mothers would to protect them. If these "things" are able to instantly "abduct" human beings, like Alfre Woodard's character, simply for knowing about what is going on then wouldn't it be simpler for them to abduct everyone involved with these children in order to have them forgotten? What are these "things" that are supposedly monitoring the planet and conducting experiments on us? Why are they being conducted? For what specific purpose? Why Earth and not some other life-inhabited planet? Even if one ignores the mind-numbing amount of holes presented in the film's sense of logic, though they are pretty hard to ignore once you get down to the bare bones of it, it must be admitted the film's ending, whether it be clich&eacute;d or admirable, is wrapped up too neatly and without any sense of surprise what-so-ever. No matter how you dress it up, The Forgotten is yet another disaster in the area of science-fiction thrillers this year joining the ranks of Godsend and The Village on the trash-heap of the box office.</p></body></html>

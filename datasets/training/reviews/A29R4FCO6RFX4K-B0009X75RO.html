<meta name="summary" content="And all that jazz"></head><body><p>Rob Marshall's jazzy adaption of Bob Fosse's 1975 Broadway musical CHICAGO is a successful attempt at combining court-room drama and classy musical numbers. And while it may not win big at the Oscars (My bet is on GANGS OF NEW YORK), it still displays enough kinetic, energising spirit to make it a worthy contender for the awards. Marshall's knowing direction makes the whole film enjoyable and the musical numbers are as kitchy as they are catchy. Richard Gere's performance as greasy, smooth-talking laywer Billy Flynn is a nice departure from his usual New York city man shtick. The leading pair of Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones have never been better. An exhilarating film that keeps up its flashy sense of fun until the closing credits, CHICAGO does razzle and indeed, dazzle.</p></body></html>

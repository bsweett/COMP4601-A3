<meta name="summary" content="good, but degenerates from a nightmare of loneliness into a botched action film"></head><body><p>This film starts out with great promise, with WS as a lone man in a world of chaos.  He is hunting, through the streets of Manhattan, for food and uninfected humans, all the while working on a vaccine for the bio-engineered virus that has more of less destroyed humanity.  WS is convincing as an anguished, intelligent man, who is struggling with his isolation, though his dog is a vital companion.  With flashbacks and preserved video cuts, past history becomes clear:  WS was an army scientist who is the only person to understand the vaccine, which is what makes him immune to the disease of the savages who come out at night.  He has lost his family, understands what has happened to the world and what needs to be done, and has a charismatic strength of character.<br /><br />So far so good.  You see WS suffer and think as well as act with the decisiveness you would expect from a hero.  There are many excellent details, such as the relationship with his dog or his golfing off the wing of a grounded jet fighter.  It is vivid and beautiful, completely believable.<br /><br />However, once the night bad guys come to the fore, the film begins to falter.  First, the night baddies are simply not well executed technically:  they don't look real, so you can't believe in them; as one reviewer noted, they look too much like video game characters.  We expect better in computer animation, I'm sorry.  Second, from an introspective survivor film, you get grotesquely violent action.  Not only is the plot unrealistic - the baddies have not discovered him until the night he is rescued by an immune woman and then they come in force - but the action is kind of ridiculous:  the baddies seem invulnerable, though they have lost their human intelligence as they transformed into hairless half-dogs and behave as if they have rabies.  They are seeking human flesh and seem to have some kind of hive mind, like an insect society, but none of the promising threads are developed into plot and theme.  There is not even enough to enable the thoughtful viewer to connect the dots, which is another indispensable component to great scifi.<br /><br />That being said, I am quite a sucker for these end-of-humanity films.  This one got me to believe, at least for the first half.  It is a mistake to have made it into an action film in the end, though WS is a good action hero.  WS' role is more dramatic than his usual roles, more complex as a character and not at all happygolucky as we expect of the fresh prince.  He is a good actor and did well here, but the script and direction  take it over the top.<br /><br />Recommended, but not with much enthusiasm.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="MARITAL MAYHEM"></head><body><p>Face it--the only reason this film did so well is that people were gaga over the romantic coupling of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  And while the two stars use their charismatic presence to propel the film, it's a two hour mismash of incoherent plotting and lots of shoot em up action, car chases and etc., etc.  The story revolves around Mr. and Mrs. Smith, a bored suburban couple who have kept the important secret that they both are "hit people" for rival companies.  When they are set up to do the same hit, they find out their secret and have 48 hours to off each other.  While the premise is unique, its execution is marred by redundancy and no real sense of humor.  It might have worked better if they had gone for a more comical approach to their attempted assassination of each other, but played with a more serious edge, the viewer fails to find any reason to cheer either actor on.  The climax is incredibly incredible and the movie seems to outstay its welcome.  MR. AND MRS. SMITH may appeal to fans of the tabloid titans, but as a movie, it doesn't offer all that much originality.</p></body></html>

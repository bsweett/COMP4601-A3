<meta name="summary" content="Involving survivalist flick"></head><body><p>Although the next two Rambo movies get progressively sillier, this is a good movie that has a surprisingly moving finale.<br />Apart from the bull headed attitudes of the local cops, we see a veteran who is a genuine guy. And we see him hurting. The final scenes, after tremendous destruction and skills with violence, are thought provoking and emotional.<br />A surprisingly thoughtful movie.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Actors Seem Aloof"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed The Good Shepherd.  I went into the film expecting a slow paced historical restrospective of the movie.  Althought that is what I received, for the most part, the difficult aspect of the movie was the feeling that the fine actors were aloof.  I had trouble connecting with some of the characters, especially the main leads.  Matt Damon did an excellent job, and I imagine he was directed in such a way as to seem a bit ambiguous.  Jolie's character could have been much richer; however, I think the complicated plot took such a long time to tell, that character development took a backseat.  To put this movie in terms of a novel, this would be a LeCarre vs. a Ludlum.  Do not go into this movie expecting a thrill a minute ala a Ludlum novel, rather expect a meandering complicated story ala LeCarre's Absolute friends.<br /><br />I have noted some very well-written reviews regarding this movie.  I agree with several of the reviewers.  However, I would argue with anyone who lables this a bad or terrible movie.  It is certainly not in my opinion.  This is a solid four star movie that falls short of a higher rating due to the inaccessibility of the characters.</p></body></html>

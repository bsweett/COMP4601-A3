<meta name="summary" content="Michael Clayton"></head><body><p>Tony Gilroy's Michael Clayton explores the corruption and underhand tactics some thriving companies will turn to in order to preserve their image and prevent a detrimental court case against them. In an unusual take on the Hollywood thriller Michael Clayton doesn't feature a hero engaging in gun battles or car chases on the streets. Instead we have a man who finds himself an unwanted target for trying to do the right thing in ensuring justice prevails.<br /><br />The film begins with an introduction to Michael Clayton (George Clooney), a fixer for the law firm Kenner, Bach and Ledeen whose knowledge of legal systems and connections allows him to secure many benefits for the firm's clients. After meeting with one client involved in a hit and run, Michael is nearly killed when he exits his car to look at a group of horses and the vehicle explodes! The film takes us back four days where Michael's debts have accumulated due to persistent gambling problems before he is called by the law firm to deal with a very pressing issue. Leading attorney Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) has had something of a breakdown while defending U-North, an agricultural products company from a lawsuit targeting their damaging fertilisers. Michael is called in to sort Arthur out but he doesn't realise the attorney is heading down a righteous path of exposing the company he is supposed to be defending for their crimes which has Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton), an employee of U-North, feeling very nervous for her company's future.<br /><br />The first point about Michael Clayton is that there is much more dialogue than there is action. It requires a lot of focus and attention to detail for its duration as Michael meets with the troubled Arthur and tries to get him back on track for the court case in defence of U-North. Though displaying signs of mental illness, Arthur has seen the error of his ways in agreeing to support U-North and he becomes something of a crusader, much to the dismay of Karen Crowder. Arthur's recorded voice is prominent early in the film and in the recording he speaks directly to Michael though are the words those of a fragile mind or one that has found a sudden injection of clarity and perspective? In the early stages Michael's role is purely to help Arthur recover from his episode but this proves difficult when he is determined to contact one of the plaintiffs Anna (Merritt Wever). As Arthur's behaviour becomes more unpredictable U-North resort to some very desperate measures to decipher how safe they are from their troubled attorney.<br /><br />Arthur's phones are bugged, his belongings searched and Karen has no issue with silencing Arthur once she discovers some very incriminating evidence he possesses against U-North. Michael also becomes caught up in the pursuit of justice and in trying to assist Arthur he becomes a target of U-North. Once we know that Arthur, despite his mental illness, holds the keys to destroying his own client it becomes a race against time for Michael to stop U-North from blocking Arthur's mission to deliver justice. It all hinges on Michael in the end but does he succeed?<br /><br />Michael Clayton is an effective thriller but the lack of action may be something of a turn-off for some audiences. Clooney and Swinton are good in their roles but it is the reliable Wilkinson that steals the show as the deeply troubled Arthur. With Michael being a fixer for his law firm there is little in the way of courtroom drama which Hollywood specialises in so that makes for a refreshingly different experience to the standard formats. The sometimes difficult plot developments are the film's only real downside and although the ending is completely apt it feels a little abrupt despite being very satisfactory.<br /><br />Michael Clayton is a good thriller but one that demands a lot of the audience. This is worth watching for the three leads who are all excellent in their respective roles. You'll have to make do without a lot of action but if you fancy a change from such films then this will be a welcome variation from a typical Hollywood court drama.</p></body></html>

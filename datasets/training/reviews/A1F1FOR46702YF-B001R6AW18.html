Master showman Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) leads an expedition to a remote tropical island and discovers a 30 foot tall gorilla that falls for his new female star Ann Darrow (Fay Wray). The expedition manages to bring the colossal beast back to New York City for exhibition but it escapes to terrorize the city. After 70 years, "King Kong" still remains as one of the most entertaining movies in cinema history.

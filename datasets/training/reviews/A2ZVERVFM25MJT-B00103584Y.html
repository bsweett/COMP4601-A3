<meta name="summary" content="Heart-racing stuff"></head><body><p>This film from German director Twyker is a real treat.  In it we follow Lola try to raise 100,000 marks for her boyfriend Manni to pay back some gangsters, the only catch being that she has to do this in only twenty minutes!  And so the audience is treated to three different ways in which Lola gets the money.<p>This film has several things going for it - a pulse-pounding techno soundtrack (with Franka Potente who plays Lola on vocals), stunning visuals and a fast story that you really get caught up in.  All of this makes for a very flashy movie that will completely draw you in.  However, what gives it that extra twist is the way in which the movie shows that the slightest thing can set the course of our future, demonstrated by snapshots of people that Lola meets in her travels through their lives.  Plus there's some extraordinary acting from the two main characters that makes you really care for their plight.<p>What's also different is the fact that the movie manages to be sad, funny and gripping.  And film that can achieve that has to be recognised.  There are also some highly interesting scenes in between each story in which the young couple discuss love, the future and other such topics.  It's little wonder that this was so highly acclaimed, and is likely to become a cult classic in years to come.</p></body></html>

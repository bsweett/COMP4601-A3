<meta name="summary" content="The Russians are coming!"></head><body><p>Salt is not what you would call a masterpiece, or even on the same level as the similar Bourne films, but thanks to Angelina Jolie, it's just entertaining enough. She carries this movie on her skinny shoulders. What's up with her lack of weight? She looked great back in the Tomb Raider days, now she looks like a twig. I guess she's still a little sexy, but that's mainly due to her on-screen presence and butt kicking attitude. She and Milla Jovovich don't really look the part at first glance, but both have become the two main female action stars on the planet. The only difference being that Jolie has a much wider range with her acting talent.<br /><br />The plot and writing are decent, but the whole Russia vs. the U.S. thing has been old for decades. There are a couple of neat twists along the way and early on you're not quite sure if Jolie's character is good or bad, so that keeps things interesting. I thought the storyline with her husband needed to be expanded upon, especially since his character is vital in changing the mindset of an important individual. The action scenes are well shot and violent for PG-13, with Jolie taking out countless armed guards with ease. Her acting ability and body control makes it all the more believable. You also get a lot of real stunts and very little CGI, which is always welcomed.<br /><br />Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor (dude needs a harder name to pronounce) are the only other main characters. They are both okay, but only a certain one gets to shine a bit more towards the end.<br /><br />Salt leaves room for a sequel or two. I read that this movie was originally written for Tom Cruise, so with the writing geared toward Angelina Jolie in future installments, I think they can be even better.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></body></html>

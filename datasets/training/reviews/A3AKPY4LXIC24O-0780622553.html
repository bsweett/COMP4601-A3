I've seen a lot of movies and it takes a tremendous  achievement in film making for me to say that I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THIS  MOVIE!  It was impossible to guess what was going to happen, the cast was  fantastic (Jennifer Connely, mmmmmmm...), the effects were worthy of an  Academy Award.  Great direction by Proyas (same guy who brought us The  Crow) and a terrific script (which, by the way won a Bram Stoker Award).  It's hard to describe this movie, a little bit of noir, a little bit of  Blade Runner, and a striking resemblance to the Borg of Star Trek: The Next  Generation.  But it's not a Star Trek movie by a longshot.  Eyecatching,  Breathtaking, my only regret is that I missed it in theaters.  If you like  action, crime, sc-fi, or horror movies check this one out or just go ahead  and buy it.  You'll love yourself in the morning if you do.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Magical Surrealism"></head><body><p>Like the novels of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, in quintissential Burton style, Big Fish weaves together elaborate tales of witches, mystical towns, giants, a circus, conjoined twins and much more into a tale of magical realism.<br /><br />The film is based around William Bloom (Billy Crudup)- a frustrated young man who travels with his wife to visit his dying father Edward Bloom(Albert Finney) in order to try and patch up their troubled relationship. The cause of this is William's annoyance (and, one senses, jealousy) at his father's incredible gift for magical storytelling. The pair flashback to relieve fantastical, biographical elements of his father's life as a boy and young man. Ewan Mcgregor plays the young Edward Bloom with a kookiness and idealistic charm although at times he fails to come across with the necessary larger than life charisma that is required of the role.<br /><br />The central message of Big Fish is the posing of the question- is it important to tell the truth, or can beautifully told stories become part of a person's character and life as much as the actual events in their life? This exploration ultimately seems rather shallow in the end. The philosophical and psychological substance of the movie doesn't quite achieve the depths that one senses Burton aspires to.<br /><br />However the film is certainly worth watching- not least for the beautifully crafted cinematography, evocative backgrounds painting a magical, traditional small town American scenes and the subtle, bittersweet score.</p></body></html>

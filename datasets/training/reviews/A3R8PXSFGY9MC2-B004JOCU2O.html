<meta name="summary" content="Unstoppable"></head><body><p>`Unstoppable' is a film that is so gripping and exciting that it will have you on the edge of your seat for much of the duration.<br /><br />Inspired by true events this film follows Frank Barnes and Will Colson as they attempt to stop a runaway train in Pennsylvania.  When a set of unlucky circumstances come together and a train is left without an engineer, carrying a highly flammable, toxic load, into a highly populated area at great speed, it will take great bravery and forward thinking to stop it.  Fortunately you get exactly these attributes in Frank and Will.<br /><br />Washington (as Frank) is as good as we have come to expect and Chris Pine plays the roll of Will very well indeed.  There are other excellent performances, most notably from Rosario Dawson as a railway despatcher clearing the line and giving advice.<br /><br />This is a relatively short film at around 98 minutes, but it kept me hooked and jittery throughout.  There is something about a runaway train that makes you very nervous.  The extra elements of the flammable cargo and the fact this is based on true events make it all the more potent.<br /><br />This is well scripted, directed and acted and made for one exciting and compelling film and I recommend it highly indeed.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

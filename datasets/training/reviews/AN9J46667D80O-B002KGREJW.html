I didn't. Well, not until the pagent scene. The look on Greg Kinnear's face was priceless, and pretty well summed-up my view of such pagents.<br /><br />But I could tell there was something good in this movie, so about a month later I watched it again, and was much happier. The performances by the entire cast were wonderful, particularly Alan Arkin. I was also pleased by the directing. Dayton and Farris have come a long way since their days of music videos (of course, some of the ones they made were for the Smashing Pumpkins, my favorite band of all-time).<br /><br />I still find the film a bit twee at times. The characters are all Quirky in that indie film way. Which at least is better than being QUIRKY!, though not as good as simply being interesting.<br /><br />Still, though, at this point my only real complaint about the movie was that they missed a chance for a great inside joke. For those of you who are movie fans, imagine the fun in them driving into Scotsdale and someone saying to Greg Kinnear's character, "Isn't this where Bob Crane died?"</p></body></html>

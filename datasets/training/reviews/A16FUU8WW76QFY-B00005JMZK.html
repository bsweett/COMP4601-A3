<meta name="summary" content="Some Interesting Stuff, But HUGE Plot Holes"></head><body><p>Here we have the long awaited (by some, anyway) "Alien Vs.Predator" film.  Not as bad as I thought it would be, the movie still fails in some areas due to bigtime plot holes and worn-out dialogue cliches from past Alien and Predator films.<br /><br />Hey, the Predator species has apparently been visiting Earth for a long time before they got hold of Arnold and Danny Glover!  They've built a pyramid with three major Earth cultures on it-but the only one that is recognizable to any degree is Egyptian, and that is done pretty badly (some of us moviegoers ARE intelligent enough to recognize Khmer and Mayan/Aztec architecture, P.W.S. Anderson).  I do seem to remember that the Predator race likes hot places from the previous films, but for some inexplicable reason they decided to build their structure in the coldest place on the planet-Antarctica.  Unfortunately, this is but one of the many plot contradictions in the film-but enough of logic.<br /><br />Sanaa Lathan plays a paper-thin artic explorer/ice climber.  Lance Henriksen is a corporate mogul type; I guess this was before he got he got ripped in half by a Queen Alien.  The dialogue is rife with cliches lifted from the other films, like 'You are one ugly (fill in the blank)!"  It gets old pretty quick.  The real stars of the film are the Predator and the Aliens, complete with Queen, Facehuggers, Chestbursters, and adult 'workers'.  The fight scenes are pretty good, even up to the big finale.<br /><br />"AVP" is about 90 minutes of weak plot and some decent action, but not much more.  2 stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Halloween II (1981)"></head><body><p>Director:  Rick Rosenthal<br />Cast:  Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasance, Charles Cyphers, Lance Guest.<br />Running Time: 91 minutes.<br />Rated R for violence, language, and nudity.<p>Picking up moments after the original &quot;Halloween&quot; left off, Michael Myers is again in search of Lorie (Jamie Lee Curtis), this time while she is at the hospital recovering from her wounds inflicted earlier that Halloween night.  With Dr. Loomis hot on his trail, Myers breaks into the hospital and slays all individuals in search of his prized possession.<p>Without John Carpenter as director (he did serve as executive producer for the film), this second installment in the series does not possess the atmospheric or suspenseful qualities that the original thrived on.  &quot;Halloween II&quot; is a good horror movie, but certainly not an exceptional one.  The most intriguing aspect of the film is that the audience learns the motive behind Michael's captivation with Jamie Lee Curtis's character--and this connection is vital to the success of the rest of the series.  Both Pleasance and Curtis are average in their performances and Rosenthal is only adequate as Carpenter's replacement.  Should have been the conclusion of the series; however, six more installments were created after.</p></body></html>

His friend played by Christopher Walken helps him out by hooking him up as a body guard.  The film takes place in Mexico City where kidnaping has become a profession.  The first half of the movie is spent on the connection of the relationship between Creasy and Pita, a little girl.  I have to admit here that I thought this movie was gonna blow, but then I remembered that I was seeing a Scott film.  And even though Ridley and Tony differ in style they are very similar in some ways.  I wasn't expecting anything to analyze in this film, but there was plenty.  Once the kidnaping takes place and Pita is announced dead we see the once loving John Creasy take a transformation into what he was in his past.  Pita unlocked what was previously locked within him, and that was the John Creasy that isn't a ruthless killer.  As usual when you walk into a Tony Scott film you have some expectations, and they are all there.  His trademark "stop and go" (as I like to call it) camera shots that flitter in different shades of light and dark, and then Harry Gregson-Williams.  I tell you, Harry and Tony seem meant for each other.  Harry's music accompanies Tony's vision so perfectly, and you can see that similarly in Spy Game.  The only thing lacking here is the "believability".  For me I did see the connection that Creasy and Pita had but as I was watching I really didn't see how she was able to make that much of an impact on him that it caused him to kill everybody who took place in her death.  The ending for me was my favorite part, it connects to several other parts of the film, mostly lines said by Creasy, and I won't say anything else that may spoil It for you.  The movie also has some pretty graphic violence but it's done in a way where you don't see much and that allows for your mind to create the graphic image.  The movie is long but it needs to be that way, and for me it was not boring at all.  I never once detracted from the film and started criticizing the film in my head, I was with it all the way through.<p>ACTING: The acting, along with Tony's directing are what makes the movie so powerful.  Denzel Washington played this role perfectly and I really couldn't see anybody else in the role.  Christopher Walken was fantastic as well and finally we get to see him back in a serious role rather than comedic like Joe Dirt, The Rundown, and the recent Envy.  Mickey Rourke plays his typecast role, but he does it good.  Even Marc Anthony (yes, the singer) is good as Pita's father, and let's not forget Dakota Fanning as Pita.  The little child actress did a phenomenal job in my opinion and her acting did not feel forced or rehearsed like most child actors, it was truly genuine.<p>BOTTOM LINE: The overall structure of the plot lacks the emotional connection that's supposed to be there, but the superb acting seems to fill it in fictitiously rather than authentically that works out for the overall effect.  Tony Scott has a distinct style that differs tone wise from his brother but there are similarities.  Man on Fire while isn't a masterpiece, is an emotional evoking film that is both poignant and thrilling at the same time.  For some, that weak emotional connection may be the factor that kills the movie for you and will result in you not liking it, but if you put that aside and allow the well-crafted visuals of the movie to do their job then you'll find the experience well worthwhile.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="They left out "Adventure""></head><body><p>While some of the special effects are better, at least during the brief capsizing sequence, Poseidon is in no other way as good as Irwin Allen's Poseidon Adventure.  That earlier version was far more faithful to Paul Galico's novel, and part of the appeal was the all star cast giving Oscar-winning performances.  In this new exploitation, they've left out many important characters and updated the script with political "correctness," leaving out, for instance, all references to religion.  This would be tolerable if they'd improved the story in some way, but they've added nothing original or imaginative, the plot's predictable, characters stereotyped, and it just seems like an action movie knock-off rather than "adventure," so no wonder they dropped that word from the title.</p></body></html>

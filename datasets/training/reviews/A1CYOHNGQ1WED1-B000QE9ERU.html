Afterwards, Castle goes to Puerto Rico for a family reunion. The mob boss sends his men down to kill Castle and his entire family. But Castle survives and returns to murder the boss, all his men and his family.<br /><br />I didn't read the comic book so I don't care if the movie followed it. I wasn't expecting much from The Punisher but thoroughly enjoyed it. Thomas Jane does a nice job in the lead role as does John Travolta as the mob boss. When Castle comes back he takes an apartment in a run down building on the outskirts of town where his neighbors are two oddballs and a beautiful, but damaged woman. I was glad to see Castle did not get involved with the woman only because it would have been too much of a Hollywood cliche, and I liked the moments of humor the two oddballs added. In a movie, this dark and violent it helped to have some light moments every now and then.</p></body></html>

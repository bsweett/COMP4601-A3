THEY GIVE IT ALL THEY'VE GOT, TRULY. IT'S A FANTASTIC LOAD OF FUN, MY FRIENDS, AND FROM BEGINNING TO HILARIOUS END. AS USUAL, UNIVERSAL BRINGS ALL THE GREAT SOUND, THE GREAT AND COLORFUL CINEMATOGRAPHY REALLY TO LIFE! IT LITERALLY SPARKLES ON DVD! I COULD NOT SEE IT IN THE MOVIES, AS I AM HANDICAPPED, BUT MY DVD ARRIVED ONE DAY EARLY TO MY PLEASANT SURPRISE, AND I WATCHED IT BACK TO BACK. HOFFMAN, AND STREISAND REALLY GRAB THE BULL BY THE HORNS HERE AS WELL. GO ON, GET IT, HAVE A GREAT TIME LAUGHING, YOU'LL NOT BE LET DOWN-I SURE WASN'T.</p></body></html>

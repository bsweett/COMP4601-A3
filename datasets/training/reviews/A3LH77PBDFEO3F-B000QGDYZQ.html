The great thing about Premonition is the thoughtful sub-story, of why you love, how much you love, and how it affects you for good and ill, and though this seems like a movie you don't have to watch closely, if you want to get that part of it you will.<br /><br />If you are expecting an action oriented time travel movie, you will be disappointed, but if you want a thought provoking story about deeper emotional issues, then this is a film you should enjoy.</p></body></html>

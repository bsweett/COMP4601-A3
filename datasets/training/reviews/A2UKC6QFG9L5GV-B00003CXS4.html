<meta name="summary" content="HILARIOUS"></head><body><p>Some people write in their reviews the movie is braindead, stupid and not funny at all. Well, it depends on what kind of humor you prefer. If you like Tarantino, Coen brothers, Guy Ritchie's "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels", films like "Thursday", "Get Shorty" and "Way of the Gun", then this opus is just for you. If you can't stand all of the listed above - just skip this one.<br />To my opinion "Snatch" is much better then previous Ritchie's work, more than that - it's one of the best criminal comedies. It's more criminal than others, it's more funny than others. Guy Ritchie actually did his best here and created an atmosphere of absurd, chaotic fun. The acting is perfect, Brad Pitt is totally different from what we used to see, Dennis Farina is just soooo hilarious! Now I can't normally see him in other movies - I recall "Snatch" and begin to laugh hysterically.<br />The characters' lines are funny and the way they deliver them is even funnier. By the way it's one of the few films I had to watch with captions - I couldn't understand much of being said because of their cockney (if I'm not mistaken) accent.<br />Anyway if you like crazy criminal comedies - watch it without any question. If you don't - watch something else instead.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A decent remake but.."></head><body><p>This is a decent remake, no where near as good as carpenters Halloween movies but none the less a decent film.  Carpenter's Halloween is a 5 star film, this remake however is not even in that class.  I am a Huge Halloween fan, I just didn't feel like this wa a true Halloween Michael Myers film.  This remake is no where near as good as the TCM remake, but over all it's a decent popcorn movie at 3 stars.</p></body></html>

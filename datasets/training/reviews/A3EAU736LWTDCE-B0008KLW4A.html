<meta name="summary" content="comic book to movie screen movies stink"></head><body><p>My problem with the movie is she is made to be a hero and a woman with a guilty conscience. Catwoman is a VILLIAN (hello!) she would not write letters of apology or save another persons life. The irony of this movie was sharron stone played more of the roll of the real cat woman then Halle did. This is the dumbest conversion of comic to movie I've ever seen. Cat woman is evil you dorks!<br /><br />How to make this movie a success?<br /><br />Give it the R rating. Make her brutally rip people apart. Make her reign the city as the major leading for, then end the movie with batman ending her reign (not that I'm a batman fan)<br /><br />Oh and I gave it 2 stars instead of one because of the gothic aspects of it</p></body></html>

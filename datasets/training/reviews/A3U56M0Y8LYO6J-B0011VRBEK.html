But I've sinned too much.""></head><body><p>At the core of Chan-wook Park's "Oldboy" is a revenge plot that is unbelievably twisted.  Discovering what that revenge plot is and why it has been perpetrated will perturb even the most hardened viewers of disturbing films.<br /><br />Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) heads home to deliver a birthday present to his daughter after being bailed out of jail.  He is kidnapped on his way home and spends the next fifteen years of his life alone and imprisoned.  He has no idea where he is, who has kidnapped him, or why he is being held prisoner.  Then one day, Dae-su is freed for no apparent reason.  With vengeance burning within him, he immediately embarks on a quest to discover the identity of his former captor.<br /><br />"Oldboy" is not a film to watch with the family.  Rest assured that this is not a warm and fuzzy Disney production.  "Oldboy" is a film that takes no prisoners and refuses to adhere to any restrictions on the presentation of its content.  Park does a marvelous job of letting the story's revelations unfold slowly in order to keep the tension building.  He also infuses "Oldboy" with a visual flair and energy that distinctively sets his film apart from earlier entries in the revenge genre.  The performances are stunning with Choi's bravura performance being the stuff of nightmares.  Ji-tae Yu as the mysterious Woo-jin Lee and Hye-jeong Kang as the sympathetic Mi-do are also excellent.  Check your expectations at the door and fall under the spell of "Oldboy" if you are not the queasy type.  You will see things you have never seen before and likely will never want to see again.</p></body></html>

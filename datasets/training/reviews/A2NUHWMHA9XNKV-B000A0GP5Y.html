<meta name="summary" content="Worth Watching"></head><body><p>I have never been one to enjoy sports movies, so I hesitated to watch it when my friend rented it...but since I'm a HUGE (and I mean HUGE) Adam Sandler fan, I decided to watch it... man am I glad I decided to!!! It was so awesome and incredibly funny!!! Two thumbs way, way up! I can't wait to go buy it!<br /><br />Chris Rock definitely upped the comedy for this movie.<br /><br />Also Recommended: Anchorman, Bad Santa, Old School</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nicholsons' finest moment..."></head><body><p>...but what scares me most about this movie every time I see it (once a year at least) is that I find myself sitting with a grin on my face amusing myself as the Jack-character crosses the border, and becomes more and more and more insane. And I usually would never get thrilled when there are violent scenes (as when Jack here threatens the "light of his life" and their son), but one should be able to call Kubricks' version of "The Shining" a dark comedy as well as it is an epic horror movie. Jack Nicholson carrying the movie with his strong and amazing acting, while the actress behind "his" wife, Shelley Duvall, gives an impressive and intense performance as well. The same goes for Danny Lloyd, the son. Some scenes involving all the actors here are legendary. Just watch the cover of the dvd as an example.<br /><br />A strong experience! Fantastic movie and forever to be a classic!</p></body></html>

But now there's a 4th: it might not be that good. Ever since Mars Attacks! in 1996, he's been weirdly inconsistent from the great (Big Fish, Sleepy Hollow, Sweeney Todd) to the mediocre (Planet of the Apes, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). It's hard to tell whether it's studio manhandling or whether he's lost "the touch" or whatever it is but the one-after-another success of the late 80's/early 90's is kind of gone and whenever he makes a good movie now, it almost seems like a "finally!" reaction than anything. So when faced with the notion of adapting one of the king's of wild imagery which is very present in the Alice in Wonderland story, I'm thinking Tim Burton, one of the last few directors with an unmistakable style, will go completely hog-wild with it. So visually, yeah, it works. The rest?<br /><br />Rather than re-tell the old familiar story of young Alice encountering Wonderland for the first time, Burton and Co. instead do what Steven Spielberg did with "Hook": a returning hero who can't remember ever having been there but everyone knows they have. So this time we have 19 year old Alice journeying back to Underland (as "Wonderland" was what she thought it was) and revisiting the old characters from the pipe-smoking caterpillar Absolem, the dimwitted twins Twiddledee and Twiddledum, the time-obsessed White Rabbit and the Mad Hatter. But if everyone's back then that also means the Red Queen is as well and Alice returning isn't making anything easier on her still-present love of beheadings.<br /><br />Disney so far has had an excellent track record with stunning Blu-Ray image transfers and this allows the visuals of the film to shine and Burton still continues his knack for making some unique and at times, almost stunning visuals. But then you see the images created by computers (of which there is many) and it becomes a bit too obvious and certain scenes and characters almost look unfinished and just scream "we're green screen!" but the film on a visual standpoint does have a great look about it, unfinished or no. The score though by Danny Elfman is quite strong and while I wouldn't say it's one of his top works on a Burton movie, it's certainly one of the better ones in years.<br /><br />Now we come down to the casting which to be honest, is really all over the place. The lead role played by Mia Wasikowska is part of it as she indeed has that confidence and almost bravado about the role yet at the same time that wonder and "what's going on?" attitude is clearly missing. I mean, even though she can't remember the first time she's been there, having disappearing cats with huge smiles or walking playing cards would certainly bring a bigger reaction than she does. Johnny Depp seems to be echoing his eccentric role as Willy Wonka but it isn't quite as lovable as Captain Jack was, another unhinged character. But then we have Helena Bonham Carter nearly completely stealing the movie as the Red Queen with a bulbous head (which strangely enough seems unnecessary when you see how well she looks sans digital ballooning) and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen. The voice work of Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Michael Sheen and Stephen Fry are very much recommended as well.<br /><br />Another slight problem I have with the movie is that it just feels slow, not necessarily boring like others have said but on one hand I felt like I didn't want to turn the movie off as I was being entertained by what I was seeing but I felt like I needed some snap in its step if you will, just a quicker pace. But then the 3rd act comes in and it's almost like a watered-down Chronicles of Narnia ending complete with a fight against a fire-breathing dragon, Alice in a metal knight armor and that damn DANCE! It's here the 3rd act just becomes too noticeable as a problem and whether you're into the tone and pace and visuals of the film or not, the last parts feel really out of place.<br /><br />Is the film worth seeing? I would suggest a viewing but when you have people saying it was one of the worst films this year to other people saying they really loved it, well, kind makes a recommend hard but I will say that the film isn't a travesty nor is it a misunderstood masterpiece. It's good, sadly nothing more and luckily nothing less.</p></body></html>

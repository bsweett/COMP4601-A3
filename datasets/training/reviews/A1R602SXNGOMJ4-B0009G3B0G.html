It is all about interpretation and nothing about preconception.<br /><br />Wounded in 1991 during the first Gulf War, and then finding himself convicted of a murder he cannot remember a year later, Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) is committed to a prison hospital where he begins to slowly waste away. When an ambitious doctor (Kris Kristofferson) decides to use Jack as a guinea pig for his medical experiments, he shoots Jack up with toxins, straps him into a straight jacket, and locks him in a morgue drawer for hours at a time. In this confined space, Jack's mind begins to violently explore his memories, ultimately giving him the ability to travel forward to the year 2007, and attempt to change his present situation with his knowledge of the future, assisted by a young girl he once met in passing (Keira Knightley).  "The Jacket" is passionate about its premise, which goes a long way to creating a film of slight entertainment value. As long as you don't stop to think, which the movie seems to be asking that you do, it provides a decent enough tale of time travel, love, and revenge.<br /><br />Adrian Brody was incredible and I thought it was directed almost flawlessly. I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

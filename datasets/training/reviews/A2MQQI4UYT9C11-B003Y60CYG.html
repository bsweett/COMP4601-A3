<meta name="summary" content="Lake Woebegone be gone?"></head><body><p>My daughter must be growing up, as she sat with my wife and me, but without complaint (albeit with a friend) through this quirky and somewhat disappointing film adaptation of Garrison Keillor's popular public radio program.  The quirkiness resulted from screenwriter Keillor and director Robert Altman's decision to wrap a ghostly, pseudo-religious story around the happenings at the last broadcast of PHC, and to exclude the storytelling around Lake Woebegone that's the hallmark of the real radio show.  Some notable non-singing stars do fine jobs in singing roles--most notably Meryl Streep as aging folk singer Yolanda Johnson.  Lily Tomlin plays sister Rhonda Johnson (she mostly sings backup).  Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly have fun as The Trailhands, a couple of sometimes off-color cowboy singers.  Three big stars are wasted in the wraparound story---Kevin Kline as detective Guy Noir; the beautiful Virginia Madsen (Sideways) as the angel of death; and Tommy Lee Jones as The Axeman, representative of the Texas corporation that's bought the Fitzgerald Theatre and shut down PHC.  There are some good folksongs and funny mock-commercials (and a great radio sound effects scene).  Since Keillor wrote the story and stars in the film, you've got to believe he was happy with the outcome.  Still, I can't help feeling that it could have come out better.</p></body></html>

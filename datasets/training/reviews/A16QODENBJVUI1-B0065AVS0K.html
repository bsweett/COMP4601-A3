<meta name="summary" content="Arguably the most original, brilliant film of the year"></head><body><p>With the appearance of SIN CITY (I managed to see it at a preview the day before general release), we have what is easily the finest adaptation yet of any graphic novel.  Not merely that, this amazing film replicates the visual excitement, dynamic vitality, and dramatic stylization of the genre.  SIN CITY isn't merely based on Frank Miller's film noir graphic tales, but an astonishingly accurate translation into a new version.  For that reason alone the film would stand out as one of the more remarkable films of recent years.<br /><br />Thankfully, SIN CITY is much more than a mere screen equivalent of some superb graphic tales:  it is by any standard a film of the front rank.  The success can be traced primarily to two individuals:  director Robert Rodriguez and writer Frank Miller.  Most fans will know that Miller has long resisted having his works turned into film, until Rodriguez sent him a brief test piece that would have knocked the hesitation of even the most sceptical author.  Miller's stories pay homage to the entire film noir and hardboiled tradition that began with Dashiell Hammett and BLACK MASK magazine (and its imitators) and has continued all the way until today with contemporary masters like James Ellroy, but he also gives each story a remarkable twist, while embedding all in a mythological setting.  Rodriguez's genius is in finding effective means to reincarnate these stories digitally.  I have been a fan of Rodriguez ever since I saw EL MARIACHI when it first came out, a film that I still consider the best no-budget film ever made, and despite the cost of the film one that will stand comparison with most of the big budget films ever made.  I have followed his subsequent career with both delight and dismay, as he did a shockingly inferior Hollywood remake of EL MARIACHI in DESPERADO that was a pale imitation of the original, and then made a string of movies that were either good (the first two SPY KIDS films), interesting if uneven (FROM DUSK TIL DAWN), or perplexingly unsuccessful (DESPERADO and ONCE UPON A TIME N MEXICO).  None of these seemed to fulfill the enormous promise of EL MARIACHI.  This one does.  This is the kind of film that possibly signals the emergence of a very promising director to the level of a great one.  The movie truly is that good.<br /><br />The film features an impressive cast, but this is not an actor's movie and they add less than one might expect.  That is not to say that they are not used well.  Indeed, Rodriguez uses all of the superbly.  Some are almost unrecognizable under various prostheses, in particular Mickey Rourke and Benicio Del Toro, neither of whom you would know was in the film unless made aware of it.  This film, in fact, represents something of a comeback for Rourke, who started off in the early 1980s as a hardboiled performer who seemed to have stepped off the pages of a Jim Thompson novel.  We've seen Bruce Willis do good things before (in addition to a lot of bad things), so his excellent job as a used up cop almost manically dedicated to preventing a young girl from being raped and murdered is no surprise.  Clive Owen, on the other hand, has been better in the past and will be better in the future.  One brilliant bit of casting was putting Jessica Alba in a key role (I'll skip the name because it would involve a spoiler).  I've always argued with friends that although Alba is without question one of the most stunningly attractive women in movies today, she is oddly not very good at being sexy.  Sure, she is sexy in that she has a face and body that are improbably perfect, but instead of radiating sex, she always manages to radiate sweetness and innocence.  You see her at length and you inevitably end up thinking, "You know, she seems like she has to be a really sweet soul."  That quality comes out here as well, and it tremendously adds to the believability of the story line of which her character is a part.  One actor whose presence is memorable even though it involved little contribution on his part was Elijah Wood as Kevin, who looks like a blend between a nerd and a manikin, but fights like a super ninja while sharing some of Hannibal Lecter's less appealing dietary habits.<br /><br />Each of the three major stories that are intertwined in the film revolves around a primary character acting as knight-errants.  In his foundational series of detective novels and stories, Raymond Chandler conceived of Phillip Marlowe as the modern, cynical embodiment of the medieval knight dedicated to fighting for damsels in distress.  Miller embraces this ideal completely in the three stories found here.  In Bruce Willis's sequence, he sacrifices everything to protect the innocent young Nancy.  In Mickey Rourke's amazing Marv sequence, a thuggish, seemingly indestructible, hideous brute of a man expends everything in order to avenge the death of a woman who has shown him a tiny bit of affectionate attention.  Clive Owen plays a man who struggles not merely for one woman but for a whole group of women.  Who said that chivalry is dead?<br /><br />Notice that I have gotten this far without saying anything about the technical innovations of the film.  Most will know that SIN CITY was primarily filmed by actors in front of green screens, with all of the backgrounds added through CGI.  SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW did this, though Rodriguez went so far as even to use digital cameras for the actors.  Some reviewers without having seen the film (look at a couple of the earliest reviewers here on Amazon, reviewers who clearly haven't seen the film) are so bothered by this that they automatically dismiss the film.  In fact, Rodriguez uses the CGI with great virtuosity, always using it to enhance and devolve the story, never to call attention to itself.  The CGI does give the stories much of the feel that one gets reading a comic, such as when Marv attacks two would-be hit men, shoving one into a brick wall, causing an indentation in it.  Unlike SKY CAPTAIN, however, the focus was always on the story and the characters, and not on the CGI.  The distribution company (Rodriguez is essentially his own studio, he and his wife operating on their own in Austin, Texas) complained about the film being in black and white, but it was a perfect choice.  There is a considerable amount of colorization, most of it to great effect.  For instance, in the opening sequence, a man is talking to a woman and mentions her eyes, and at the word "eyes" they go from black and white to a subtle green.<br /><br />I honestly feel that this film represents a turning point in several ways.  First, it might represent the complete shift from Robert Rodriguez from promising director to a full-fledged master.  Second, it could be the film that provides the model for all that follow in the correct use of CGI.  Third, it could serve as the pattern for future adaptations for the filming of graphic novels.  But all that aside, people need to see this because it is one of the best and most original films of the past couple of years.</p></body></html>

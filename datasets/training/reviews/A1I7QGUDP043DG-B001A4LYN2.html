<meta name="summary" content="Very dark."></head><body><p>Very dark, but poignant story of a crazed oil man who has a passion for money and little use for people.  I kept hoping for an enlightening moment in this dark character, but his humanity just continues to seep out of his soul like the oil than runs from the ground, and he continues to make deep wounds in the earth...and himself. There appears to be no cure for the main character (played by Daniel Day Lewis), his heart just grows harder and more destructive.  Opportunities for redemption and love are right in front of him, but he turns a blind eye. The story is rich in emotion and the acting riveting, but there is no happy ending.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

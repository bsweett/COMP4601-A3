<meta name="summary" content="Russian Mafia"></head><body><p>An in depth intense look at the Russian Mafia. If you enjoy intense dramas like "The Departed" or "Donnie Brasco", you will probably enjoy this one. Several excellent performances. Viggo Mortensen is great as a driver for the mob that has a sketchy past. Although there is some bloody hardnosed intense moments it will still appeal to most members that enjoyed "The Godfather", which was not exactly truly family friendly either. The trailer gives a fairly accurate idea of what the movie is about. A mafia member rises in the ranks by killing people but may not be what he appears to be. Overall a great story, directing, acting, and music. Although I typically don't recommend buying dramas this intense, this is one of those that stand out like "Taxi Driver", and are a must have. Good DVD with good replayability.</p></body></html>

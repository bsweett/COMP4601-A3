<meta name="summary" content="Abysmal"></head><body><p>Weird screenplay fulfilment of the novel.<br /><br />Hokey noir effort.<br /><br />Acting: None of the actors were at their best. Aaron Eckhart was perhaps the best, followed closely by Fiona Shaw as Mrs. Lindscott. From there the movie disappointed.<br /><br />The dialogue was very difficult to hear, we kept having to put the volume all the way up.<br /><br />The plot was confusing, especially at the beginning and end (when it's most important).<br /><br />Scarlett Johansson was almost likeable, but looked horrible and almost unattractive. She looked as if she were ill and didn't fit the part at all. Swank tried her best, but did not fully pull off Madeline Lindscott. And Josh Hartness, whose performance I enjoyed in "LUCKY NUMBER SLEVEN" seemed to sleepwalk through this one. I think he was too young or lacked character of facial expressions for the boring slow plotline. Mia Kirschner was entertaining as the murder victim herself, in those screentests which were hilarious.</p></body></html>

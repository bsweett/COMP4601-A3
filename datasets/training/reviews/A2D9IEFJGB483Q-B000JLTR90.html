He has given us affair tale for grown ups, following the trend that was started by C. S. Lewis in "That Hideous Strength."<br /><br />So does the film work?  I am still wondering about that.  On a superficial level, the film strikes me not as a bomb, but more as a misfire.  The water-nymph seems too much like Disney's Little Mermaid, with red hair and an undersea cavern where she keeps her collection of man-objects.  The cruel death of the film-critic was a two edged sword--a comic-relief made funnier by his seriousness, and also fantasy projection of M. Night and his real-world critics.  And casting himself as the messiah seemed like autoerotic genuflection, and a window into his psyche and dreams.<br /><br />In fact, the film had the feel of the dream.  The lopsided bodybuilder is a classic example of a person one would see in a dream, symbolic of a half-complete and half-incomplete person.<br /><br />I have a paradoxical observation. First, the pacing was too slow, and second, the film needed to be longer.  The film was too compressed; I felt like I was watching several run-on chapters.  The film, like a symphony, had movements and vignettes, but it lacked a lynchpin.  The several subplots did not gel.<br /><br />So what would I change? First, remove the preachy introduction.  We are given enough clues in the film to piece it all together, which is a credit to M. Night's writing.<br /><br />Second, distance Story from The Little Mermaid--cast her as an Asian and remove the "Part of Your World" grotto.  The hair change was not commented on and I wonder if it was an obvious and sloppy continuity error.  And lose "narf"--too "Pinky and the Brain." Stick with nixie, naiad, or sea-nymph.  And then tell us why you are so fond of water--"Unbreakable" and "Signs." Or is this your version of Arthur's "Lady in the Lake."<br /><br />Third, round out the characters--there were too many, and what we saw were flat, dream-like images.  All of these secondary characters threw the film off-center and distracted from the relationship between Story and Cleveland.<br /><br />Fourth, get collaborators.  Being the writer, director, and producer feels good, but you are going to burn out--Rod Serling,  Brian Wilson, Bill Corgan, and Brian Wilson.  Paul McCartney had John Lennon; the Beatles had George Martin; Brian Wilson had Mike Love, Tony Asher, and Van Dyke Parks; and Lucas and Spielberg have each other.  It is no shame or disgrace, and collaborators can help round out ideas.<br /><br />In closing, I think M. night took a risk on this film.  His post-6th Sense films (i.e. all but the first) have not done well, thought they all artistic classics.  Maybe M. Night is not the next Spielberg, but the next Orson Welles.</p></body></html>

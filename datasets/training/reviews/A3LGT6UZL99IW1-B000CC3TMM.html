<meta name="summary" content="Plot? What plot? Action? Yes. Acting? no way."></head><body><p>We know things are going to be pretty silly when the opening driving sequence is in an automatic. Let's watch the Transporter power shift an automatic trans. What skill, what cunning, what a load.<br /><br />Car stunts? Plenty. They're so over the top that I expect to see "acme" stamped on the side of the car and hear a "beep beep" as the Road Runner escapes yet again.<br /><br />If you're looking for a no-talent, underfed waif with size negative a cup and Tammy-Fae taste in makeup, here she is. Sexy she is NOT.  Come on?! There was potential to make this chick a threat, nay, even an equal to our Transportation Dude. The director opted in for the "I have not eaten in six months, can't do makeup, don't know how to act, full-auto clips that don't run out" look.  Pathetic.<br /><br />Sure, it was mindless (mindnumbing) entertainment.  But when it was (finally) over, I expected the Loony Tunes "That's all folks" - it was that cartoonish.</p></body></html>

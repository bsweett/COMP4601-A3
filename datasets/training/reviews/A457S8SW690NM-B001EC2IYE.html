<meta name="summary" content="My favorite Clint Eastwood movie tied with Unforgiven"></head><body><p>Personally, I wasn't even that excited to see this movie but all of the rave reviews made me have to. The movie is a masterpiece, as good as Unforgiven, probably even better. These 2 movies are my favorite Clint Eastwood movies. Like Unforgiven, you should want to watch this movie let alone for the excellent reviews and 4 oscars!<br /><br />The movie is very unique in its own because it will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and boo. Now, that's something to see. Also, the acting in the movie is brilliant. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman, 2 of the best actors of all time shine in this one. Hilary Swank also gives a remarquable performance as does the rest of the cast.<br /><br />The movie is about Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), a woman boxer who finally convinces Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) to become her trainer. Frankie is a sad man who owns a gym and is a boxing trainer and manager. He goes to church very often as he misses his daughter. You pity him because his daughter won't talk to him and returns all of his letters unread. He is a sad man. All he has is his gym and his friend Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman). That's until he trains Maggie. Maggie becomes one hell of a fighter and knocks out most of her opponents in the first round (in a rather comical way). Maggie is to Frankie, his daughter that he never had. It helps him to forget about his daughter who is hurting him and now he has a good friend and a daughter figure. The movie develops at a great pace and is always exciting. But, the end is very sad and tragic and is unlike other PG-13 movies. If you would have to see one PG-13 movie out of all of them, definitely make it this one. This is now on my wish list to buy and is a beautiful masterpiece. It's a movie that everyone will cherish and love. Everything in the movie is perfect besides one thing. The F word is used once... Guess by who... A preacher/ pastor!!!!!!!!! Thats kind of strange.. But anyway, this is an excellent movie that EVERYONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD should see, and if you haven't seen it yet... well...you should IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!!</p></body></html>

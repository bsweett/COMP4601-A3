<meta name="summary" content="The importance of being earnest&#65533;I mean Spiderman"></head><body><p>Peter Parker nearly forgets that when due to several crises occurring in his already hectic life, he chucks the famed red suit and mask in a dumpster.  "I am Spiderman no more," he declares.  Indeed, his hectic life is divided going to college, working as a pizza delivery boy, trying to get enough money to pay his long overdue rent, and fighting crime as his alter-ego.  The trouble is, he doesn't have much of a life as a result.  He's so stressed, he even forgets it's his birthday, and hasn't been in contact with his friend Harry Osborn, still grieving over the death of his father in the first Spiderman and still seeking vengeance on Spiderman, and with Mary Jane, acting in The Importance Of Being Earnest.  Unfortunately, an act of crime fighting causes him to be late for the play, disappointing the already beleaguered MJ, who announces that she is seeing someone.  That someone turns out to be the son of The Daily Bugle's J. Jonah Jameson, the egomaniac tabloid editor who still treats Parker like dirt beneath his shoes and prides himself on wanting to drive Spidey out of business.<p>This installment has Spidey fighting Dr. Octopus, the former Otto Octavius, a scientist whose attempts to create a new kind of fusion technology that would yield cheap energy or make Manhattan toast with enough for a side of eggs result in an accident where the artificial nervous system with four shiny metallic tentacles become fused to his body.  Unfortunately, the chip that gives him control of his mind is destroyed, turning him into a villain who wants to restart the fusion experiment that failed.  And for that, he turns to crime, his appearance heralded by the same pounding footsteps reminiscent of a T-Rex in Jurassic Park or Godzilla in Godzilla (1998).  But Octavius isn't a clear cut villain, but a victim of circumstance, like Mr. Freeze in the fourth Batman.  Before his transformation, he's a genius, but also a loving husband to his wife.  He tells Peter Parker that knowledge is a privilege, but also not to suppress the love one feels for someone<p>It seems that Parker is happy to no longer be the webslinger.  His grades improve, he makes an effort to have a life, and his less-stressed look yields a smile on his face, evident in a series of shots with B.J. Thomas's "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head" playing.  But the question is this.  As his late Uncle Ben told him, he had a special gift, and with that gift, moral responsibility.  His wishes to have a normal quiet life, to win back MJ, are overshadowed by his moral responsibility because he is denying himself his potential, or the importance of being earnest, namely being Spiderman.  Loving MJ is impossible, because saving other people takes precedence, plus she would be his Achilles heel.  All his enemies have to do is take her hostage to gain an edge over him.  And more to the point, with Spidey out of the way, Dr. Octopus and other criminals have a free-for-all.<p>Tobey MacGuire fits snugly in the role of Parker as Parker does in the Spidey costume, someone's who quite appealing, sympathetic, and sensitive, a guy trying to juggle many priorities.  From Indiana Jones's treacherous assistant in Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Joe Orton's lover and murderer in Prick Up Your Ears, the religious mayor of the provincial town in Chocolat, and Diego Rivera in Frida, Dr. Octavius demonstrates another interesting role for the versatile Alfred Molina.  The real surprise here is Kirsten Dunst, who has never been more appealing than here instead of just being another pretty face.  And yes, there is another Stan Lee cameo, but you better look quick aboard a runaway train.<p>Spiderman 2 surprised me by being better than expected and the special effects, which I normally deem a secondary consideration, are superior.  There's a very human story beneath, and as a result, I deem it the best superhero movie I've seen since Superman.</p></body></html>

Treadwell spent 13 summers in the wilds filming Grizzlys and shot over 100 hours of wildlife film.<br /><br />The wildlife film itself is stunning. Grizzly bears are awesome creatures. At one point a large one stands up on two legs in front of Treadwell as he is filming. Minutes later when the Bear has gone Treadwell films himself standing in the same position and as he says the Bear on its two hind legs must have been 10 feet tall. From a wildlfe point of view this is a stunning film, but I would have preferred a<br /><br />little more film of wildlife and little less of Treadwell.<br /><br />The other side of the film revolves around the death of Treadwell and his girlfriend Amie by a Grizzly attack. There death was captured on audio (Treadwell had his camcorder running) and Werner Herzog wisely decided against putting the audio track into his film. We see him listening to it and this is disturbing enough.<br /><br />Herzog has made a film that leaves you to make up your own mind about Timothy Treadwell. Both critical and appreacitive words are spoken about him in the film but I suspect most people will view the film and be grateful for the footage he shot, and be sad that he and his girlfriend were killed. There probably isn't enough information in the film to pass judgement on the rights and wrongs or validity of what Treadwell was doing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Superman Returns only to disappoint"></head><body><p>I thought Singer's XMen movie was decent. I thought XMen 2 was awesome! I know first films are difficult. The director and the writers have to set the stage for the characters which have been living in comics for decades. There had never been an XMen movie until Singer directed the first one. There have been four Superman movies before this one.<br /><br />My filmgoing companion loved the film. I was sorely disappointed with Superman Returns. Actors aside, the script is just not enough different from the original Superman film. So what's the point of recreating it? There's all sorts of "big" action (he stops a plane from crashing - the best action in the film - and other "big" stuff) but it ends up being non action, because it's all just too big and outlandish. And isn't anyone else out there getting more than a little bored with Lex Luthor - a mere mortal, albeit a megalomaniacal one - being the be all, end all nemesis for the Man of Steel? For Pete's sake there are many other villains that they could bring to the forefront. Let's see Superman fight for crying out loud! I'm sick to death of seeing him (on the big screen) stop trains, planes, buildings, signs, etc. It's all too big, too predictable. He can't fight Lex Luthor because Luthor will drop dead with one punch. After all Superman is SUPER! Give Superman someone SUPER to fight! What about Brainiac? What about dozens of other villains he's fought over the years? Geezaloo, are the writers/producers that narrow minded?<br /><br />Now, to the CGI (special effects)...didn't anyone else find Superman's look to be more than a little "plastic" looking? I was jarred out of my suspension of disbelief repeatedly by the smooth appearance of Superman's face and tights etc. He looked like a computer generated character rather than a living breathing actor (the handsome but stiff Brandon Routh).<br /><br />All in all, the best Superman storyline and proper updating of Superman has been getting done in the television series "Smallville" which has breathed far more life into the character and the stale storylines than Singer's blockbuster budgeted film ever could. In the television series Clark Kent isn't a complete bumbling dolt and as such he is fresh and believable.<br /><br />Unless Superman (read: producers, director, and studio) can come up with some better storylines and fresh villains, I'm afraid any future outings will just be further dull, listless outings. Give me the XMen, Smallville, Spiderman, HellBoy, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and such as my super heros any day over the stiff and repetitive Superman Returns. The super heros in those films are hands on and the action is more "real". Sure, Superman is supposed to be "superior" and stand for truth, justice and the American way, but what's he's turned into is a big ol' dull goody two shoes with more muscles than sense.</p></body></html>

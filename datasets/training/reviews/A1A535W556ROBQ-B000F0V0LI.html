<meta name="summary" content="Great film, mediocre DVD"></head><body><p>Given the stature of this film, one would expect a better quality DVD.  I can only hope that one will soon be made available.  This is perhaps the greatest Western of all time.  Wayne turns in his most compelling performance as the lone wolf, Ethan, forced to confront an old Indian nemesis, Scar.  Ford sets Wayne against the backdrop of Monument Valley, as Ethan tracks down a teenage girl (Natalie Wood) who had been abducted by Scar.  The film can be a little uneven but it tells a very intriguing story.  Ford confronts racism and feelings of isolation, steering away for the most part from cliche images of the West.  Edward Buscombe has written a fine piece on &quot;The Searchers&quot; for BFI Film Classics which is well worth reading as it fills you in on the making of film, offering notes on Ford's epic vision.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A BIT DATED BUT STILL ARGUABLY A CLASSIC WORTH SEEING"></head><body><p>This picture was released after the Cuban Missile Crisis when the world held it's breathe at the threat of nuclear war and nobody laughed at you if you were building a bunker in your backyard.  The tale is a satire with over the top characters who justify their crazy behavior in, yes, over the top manners.  Peter Seller's recent success in playing multiple characters in LOLITA gets him three roles in this film (U.S. President, RAF second Mandrake and Dr. Strangelove) and arguably his most memorable is as the crippled, queer smiling borderline Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove.  Some of the humor is a bit dated but some of it is still pretty funny to watch.  The complexity of this picture might confuse some viewers.  This film won AFI recognition over several years.  I suspect the ending influenced later media projects like the Fallout video games.  STORY/PLOTTING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus  HUMOR: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday; OVERALL GRADE: B.</p></body></html>

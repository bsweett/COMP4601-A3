<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant, but pretty gross and bluntly brutal"></head><body><p>This is a crime story like no other. Most of these kind of, serial killer on the loose, movies don't get into such specific detail of the crimes like in SEVEN. When I saw Seven as a kid, I thought it was disgusting, but not necessarily scary, when everyone was told it was a horror before it came to theatre's. It is a horror in a way. But a different "kind" of horror. I was too young to understand everything that occured throughout the film. I had to ask mom some questions but she never gave me a blunt answer. She always sugar coated everything up. Now I'm 23, and I've seen SEVEN many times. The most disturbing scene in the movie is (I'm not sure if everyone understood) but I did.. it was when detective mills and sommerset go to that bondage shop to see a photograph of an object the store-owner made for joe doe (the killer) It doesn't really let you see the photo for that long. Only a quick glance but if you have it on DVD you can pause it and get a good look at it. First, it is a ribbed knife over 8 inches long that straps around the guys waiste like a strap on adult toy, but instead it's a knife, and in the photo a real person is not wearing it, only a dummy. Then, when he goes after his next victim, the killer goes to a whore-house, and barges in on a man who paid for the hooker. He pulls out a gun, and forces the married man to put on the weapon and told him to "F*ck her". If you can imagine how brutal that is. It is a bit crossing the line in a very disturbing way. They show the photo again, when they are questioning the tramatized man who was forced to kill the prostitute by stabbing her reproductive organs with an 8 inch knife. Once again, that's a very graphic thing to have in a movie. And the other murders were especially haneous. Over feeding the fat man to death, cutting off the beauty queen's face, forcing atrition on the lawyer to cut his own stomach open, cutting off gweneth's head, and torturing a drug dealer for a year. It ceratinly isnt a bed time story, or for the religious fanatics.</p></body></html>

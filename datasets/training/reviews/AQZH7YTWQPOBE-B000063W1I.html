<meta name="summary" content="Greatest film ever"></head><body><p>What can I say about this film? It captures the height of sci-fi/fantasy cinema during the late 1970s/early 1980s in all of its glory. The three kids all pull off their parts wonderfully (this movie was easily Drew Barrymore's best role). E.T. comes across as extremely convincing, largely due to the excellent puppet used.<br /><br />And about that puppet - in 2002, Spielberg made a few CG enhancements to the movie. I think most of the changes were for the better. Sometimes the CG E.T. looks a bit too C.G., but other times CG does enable him to exhibit a greater range of facial expressions. I think much of it still works because the actors used the original C.G. puppet, so they were able to give better performances than would have been possible otherwise.<br /><br />I also think replacing the guns with walkie-talkies was an acceptable move. While I don't care much for being politically correct, it always did seem a bit odd to me that NASA agents were chasing a bunch of kids while brandishing rifles. They obviously didn't plan to shoot the kids, otherwise they would have. Either way, Spielberg includes the 1982 original version - unlike Lucas - so you can enjoy the movie either way.<br /><br />During the Cold War, the U.S. showed Soviet defectors this movie to introduce them to the potential and imagination of the American way of life. Nowadays, I wish more producers would revisit this movie to try to recapture some of that movie magic we kids enjoyed during there 1980s.</p></body></html>

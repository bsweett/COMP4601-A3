Unfortunately, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is more like a mess you'd find in the closet of a guy who lives in a basement apartment in his mother's house; a guy who smokes too much weed, or dropped too much acid in high school.

Had the movie stuck to that kind of kinetic and campy fun, this film might have been a great entertainment.

<meta name="summary" content="Now this is what HD is for!"></head><body><p>HD definitely does wonders for these kind of action movies. It really brings them to life, and does them justice. I did originally see it at the cinema, but HD certainly comes second to seeing a film at the cinema. It's THAT good.<br /><br />The film is actually R-rated in America, but was only 12A here. The previous two were 15's, so I thought were gory/violent bits cut out of T3. I seriously didn't notice whether there was anything cut. On a second watching, maybe, but I really wasn't looking for cuts. You have to feel sorry for Arnie throughout this film, he really gets a rough ride.<br /><br />The film starts off like T2 - except it's John Conner talking about the future, rather than Sarah Conner, who doesn't appear in this film. I'm glad she refused to do it, especially after her appearance in T2 - she did NOT look right with those muscles. To explain her disappearance, she was killed off (charming). She simply appeared via a coffin. Nick Stahl, who does a great job of taking over from Edward Furlong, plays John Conner. I will always know Nick Stahl from `The Man Without A Face', where he played opposite Mel Gibson. He was a lot younger in that film, but he still looks the same, even with stubble, and looks a tiny bit older.<br /><br />When the TX appears, played by "model" (and boy, can you see it!) Kristianna Loken, I was glad that I wasn't in the cinema with a bunch of teenage guys, who would have probably started wolf whistling. She does appear naked for the first couple of minutes, and her hair is artfully brushed to cover her up, so nothing is seen. She scares the living daylights out of a woman, before taking over her car. She also manages to scrape her long hair back into a tight bun, which is very stereotypical for a female in this kind of film. She looks tough and hard-faced. I'd love to see the outtakes from this film, to see whether she does actually laugh during scenes, which then have to be cut out. She remains expressionless, and hardly speaks. Arnie speaks more in this film! And in any of the fight sequences, does a hair get harmed or get out of place on her blonde head? No way!<br /><br />Of course, Arnie appears naked too, and immediately walks into a strip club, full of screaming women. He tells the male stripper (who sounds obviously gay) to give him his clothes, and then dresses up in them. He pulls out the shades, which are star-shaped and look as though they've been borrowed from Elton John! Thankfully, he finds a cooler pair of shades. Arnie wouldn't be the Terminator without his shades. Not quite Matrix shades, but never mind.<br /><br />Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) plays an old schoolfriend of John Conner's, and it just so happens, that they "made out" in someone's basement. So there's a certain connection, although absolutely NO chemistry between them. She almost turns out to be a resurrection of Linda Hamilton's character, even John Conner comments on this! You need a tough female character (apart from stony-faced Kristianna), and Linda Hamilton filled that part very well, in the first two films. Now Claire Danes has taken over from her. She's a far cry from the only other role I've ever seen her in, that of Juliet in Baz Luhrmann's `Romeo & Juliet'.<br /><br />There are two, very obvious hints that there will be a T4, and personally, the format is getting a little tired now. You know the various Terminators are going to come back and try & kill off John Conner, and he's going to succeed each time. I don't think they can carry on with this story much longer, it will have been milked for all its worth by the end of the next film. And they should change the story - maybe set it in the future? (But would it still be called Terminator?) But what with the lovely Arnie being governor of California now, he obviously has lots more important things to do than star in another film.<br /><br />This is a great film, if you're a fan of the Terminator series. It's best if you have already seen T1 and T2 to get continuity of the film. It's easily my favourite, after watching them all a couple of times now.</p></body></html>

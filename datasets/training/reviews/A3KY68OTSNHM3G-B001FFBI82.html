<meta name="summary" content="Operation Desert Storm Through One Marine's Eyes"></head><body><p>Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx star in this movie about the life of a marine and his journey through boot camp and into the fighting of the first Gulf War.  Gyllenhaal stars as Anthony Swofford, a twenty year old raw recruit who joined the Marines because, in his words, he got lost on the way to college.  Upon arriving in boot camp, Swoff witnesses some other Marines with a homemade USMC brand.  Soon, Swoff is corralled by the other Marines, thrown to the ground, and the brand is brought to his leg.  However, Swoff ends up passing out.  Upon waking, he realizes that he wasn't branded.  Troy (Peter Sasarsgaard) informs Swoff that he must earn the brand.  The two soon become friends.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx stars as Staff Sergeant Sykes, a career soldier who is in command of an eight-man sniper team.  There are four spotters and four shooters.  Swoff is chosen as a shooter, while Troy becomes Swoff's spotter.  The group trains endlessly until all the members of the team are experts at their craft.  During their training, the Iraqis invade Kuwait, and Swoff's unit is sent to the Gulf as part of Operation Desert Shield.<br /><br />Upon arriving in the Gulf, the men find themselves with a little too much time on their hands.  Time is spent by writing letters or playing football.  In one instance, their football gets them into trouble, as Sgt. Sykes forces the men to put on their chemical warfare suits and play an entire game of football while members of the press look on.<br /><br />After being in the Gulf region for several months with no action besides their own training, the war finally began in January, 1991.  When the land campaign began, Swoff's unit was thrust into the fighting.  Swoff and Troy were chosen to take out two Iraqi soldiers who were in a control tower.  Making their way cautiously over the hot desert sand, they arrive at the perfect shooting site, 900 yards from their target.  Having been given clearance to shoot, Swoff prepares to pull the trigger on his sniper rifle.  However, just before he can shoot, another officer bursts through the door and informs Swoff and Troy that an airstrike is going to take out the tower.  Despite all of their training and time spent in the Gulf, Swoff never got to fire his rifle in anger.<br /><br />After the war, the group returned to the United States to many well-wishers who welcomed them home.  One poignant moment at the end of the movie shows a Vietnam vet jump into Swoff's company's bus and shake hands with the men while telling them that they did a great job.  One can sense that the Vietnam vet wished he would have received the same type of welcome twenty years earlier.  Swoff's war lasted 4 days and 4 hours.<br /><br />This is a very powerful movie.  It compares closely to Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket".  Both movies were told through the eyes of a single soldier.  The accuracy of life in the desert is apparent throughout the movie, especially the parts where the soldiers are forced to deal with their boredom.  The battle scenes are authentic as well, including the massive wreckage caused by the A-10 "Warthog" tank busters against Iraqi vehicles.<br /><br />I recommend this movie.  The acting, especially by Jamie Foxx and Jake Gyllenhaal, is very good, the combat sequences are realistic, and the story is compelling.  Watch this very good movie and experience life in the Marines during Operation Desert Storm through the eyes of a Marine sniper.</p></body></html>

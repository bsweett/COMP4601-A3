<meta name="summary" content="Classic Cult Hit that Spawned Unending Sequels"></head><body><p>Though nominated for its share of Razzies back in the day, Friday the 13th is unquestionably a significant film, for better or worse.  On the good side, Friday the 13th helped to bring horror to the forefront again.  On the bad side, Friday the 13th signaled the beginning of a shameless marketing effort based on exploitation.  It is the quintessential slasher film and I can't say whether that is a wholly bad or a wholly good thing to be.  It is an incredibly derivative film that borrows from many of the things that highlighted horror classics from the 1970s.  The obvious borrowing from Halloween and Black Christmas is there, but the way it reinforced previously established clich&eacute;s is absolutely groundbreaking due to the film's massive popularity.  Even the great scary ending with Jason leaping from the water was a formula borrowed from Brian De Palma's Carrie, and it was repeatedly used again and again thereafter...even in Friday the 13th's many sequels.<br /><br />In 1958, two sexed-up camp counselors (the standard victim in these films) are murdered.  The film forwards to 1980, the camp has a curse and we are given more than our fair share of foreshadowing.  A little boy drowned in Crystal Lake a year earlier.  That little boy is Jason and as we all know by now, the killer is his vengeful mother.  After the plot introduction phase we are introduced to a group of shallow camp counselor characters.  They are gradually murdered in many different gruesome ways by the then unknown assailant.  Kevin Bacon plays one of the counselors in an early role.  Eventually we find out that the killer is Pamela Voorhees (played by a less than enthusiastic but still professional Betsy Palmer) and the surviving counselor Alice cuts her head off.  As Alice waits in the lake in a canoe for help to arrive, the decaying body of a little boy Jason Voorhees jumps out of the lake to pull her into the water.  She is seen soon after in the hospital and asks the policeman "The boy...is he dead too?"  The policeman responds and indicates that they found no boy.<br /><br />As silly as this movie is, it certainly has a classic scary moment when Jason jumps out of the lake.  It is the scariest single moment in this long series of movies and one of the greatest jump scares of all time.  I'm too cynical to credit this movie for its success outside of its cultural impact.  It is a phenomenon and a standard setter, but it is also a very flawed movie that unfortunately set standards for many more flawed imitators that would follow.  It is hard to properly learn from a film that has nothing to teach.</p></body></html>

Tucker especially makes the movie which is filled with fun, wacky characters from the "far reaches of the galaxy." The plot was far-fetched, but it's a Science-Fiction picture for crying out loud!! I laughed and cried (not literally but you get the idea). A must see, but according to other reviews, not one you're likely too.</p></body></html>

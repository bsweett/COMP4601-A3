<meta name="summary" content="A real-world "legal thriller" with mesmerizing characters"></head><body><p>Michael Clayton is an ex-criminal lawyer who apparently burned himself out as a prosecutor a decade and a half ago and then went to work for a large Manhattan firm, where he has settled into an uncomfortable, frequently unpleasant niche as the firm's "fixer" -- what he refers to as a "janitor," cleaning up other people's messes. You want a congressman bought, a hit-and-run handled, a green card obtained, you go see him. The firm has been involved for years in a class action suit in which U-North, a huge agribusiness corporation, is accused of killing off a couple of hundred small farm operators with carcinogenic chemicals, and it's all coming down to the wire when the lead attorney, a manic depressive, goes off his meds and publicly off his nut, and then begins making the case for the other side. U-North can't have that, especially since there's a highly incriminating memo floating around. Karen Crowder, the new corporate counsel, anxious for a win to kick off her career, can only think of one way to handle the situation. What's a murder or two compared to a $3 billion lawsuit, right? The story starts in media res and it takes a little while to figure out just what's going on -- just like real life -- but it will suck you right in in very short order. The characterization is multidimensional, the numerous subplots and bits of business are beautifully woven into the main action, and the dialogue is extremely good. This dark and thoroughly gritty film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay, but the only winner was Tilda Swinton as the amoral Crowder. This is George Clooney's best serious work in a long time.</p></body></html>

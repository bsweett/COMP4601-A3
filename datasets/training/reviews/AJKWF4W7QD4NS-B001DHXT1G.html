<meta name="summary" content="Finally, the Hulk movie that we wanted and deserved"></head><body><p>Ang Lee's 2003 take on the Hulk was an ambitious, but ultimately flawed, adaptation of the classic Marvel character that managed to somewhat capture the tragedy of the character, but proved supremely underwhelming in delivering the action goods.  With this reboot directed by Louis Letterrier (Transporter 2, Unleashed), the Hulk gets a fresh start, and it's all the better for it.  The Incredible Hulk stars Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, who has managed to evade capture by living in Brazil for the past few years, and keeping his monstrous alter-ego at bay as well.  A search for a possible cure brings Bruce out of hiding, as his nemesis General Ross (William Hurt) employs spook agent Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to bring Banner in, by any means necessary, even if it means turning Blonsky into some sort of Abomination (I'm sorry, I just couldn't help myself).  With loads of odes to the comic and even more to the classic 70's series, The Incredible Hulk delivers in terms of action and excitement, and even manages to pull out some surprises as well.  The only real flaws of The Incredible Hulk are some plot-holes in the story and the mis-casting of a stale Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, but that aside, this film still makes up for the Ang Lee mis-fire.  Also starring Tim Blake Nelson and Ty Burrell as some important supporting players in Hulk lore, and featuring an ending that will send fanboys in an uproar, The Incredible Hulk truly is a smashing and entertaining good time.  All in all, it's nice to finally have the Hulk movie that we wanted and deserved, and longtime fans of comic should definitely enjoy it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The review after cinema"></head><body><p>Hurricanes...tornados...hail storms...sudden climate changes in the region...hmm, I don't see a big problem with the world right now, but the people at 20th Century Fox tries to shows off these CG weather conditions, in a much darker tone.<p>[REVIEW]<p>The Day After Tomorrow, yearly waited for its release, promised itself to be a disaster film with social commentary, enacting what would happen and what people should think if people keeps messing with Mother Earth, and its director Ronald Emmerich that will take the job showing the message.  People should know him for directing the addicting sci-fi action flick, "Independence Day"...and also directed the nuclear disaster that is "Godzilla."  Emmerich decided to put away the toys of big monster movies, and pick up the building blocks of disaster films.  The result of direction and idea is a movie that visually stunning and shocking from its brink of impending doom, and a little humorous.  It's beautiful and thrilling...but how beautiful and thrilling this movie is?<p>Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) and his group of 'paleoclimatologists' were in Antarctica studying the climate of the continent when a huge crack the size of Rhode Island happened in front of them.  We should all thank global warning for that, as Jack Hall mentions in a international conference, when he said that the new ice age might occur much sooner than they think, thanks to the information that gives early warning signs, but does anyone pay attention to these early warning signs?  NOOO!  Later on, his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), was on a plane trip to New York(which is basically Quebec in real life) for a Decathlathon, along with his buddy and love interest, fearing that danger might lure its ugly head.  And danger does lure itself in the world, and thanks to people who don't pay attention to the weather channel, heavy hail storms occur in Japan, hurricanes occur in India, and catastrophic tornados occur in the popular city of Los Angeles(at least the people there don't have to worry about smog).  Other weathering cataclysms occur in different places, and soon the NYC will experience disaster...yet again, thanks to a huge wave that will flood the whole city and the people in it.  At an even worse situation with the earth, Jack reported that the entire northern hemisphere will be covered up in ice, thanks to some holes in the atmosphere that will instantly solidify anything that surrounds these holes.  To put it short: the survivors up north were out of the frying pan, and into the freezer.  Jack and his paleocli-whatever buddies decide to go north, risking themselves to find his son struggling to survive uptown before the final stage of the new ice age commence.<p>The cinematics are hot.  Nevermind the story, the people are going to spend what they have to see some good, over-the-top special effects.  The special effects and CGI scenes were great, though, much improved over "ID4"...or any world-troubling film for that matter.  The director did a good spending most of the movie's budget on perfecting the simulation of the dangers of global warming.  The cast consist of Disney and Nickelodeon-fame, but their performances were decent to say the least.  This movie is solid when it comes to its whole production process, though people that were looking for a piece of cinema that's remarkable may want to look elsewhere.<p>I hate to be the bearer of negative criticism, even to a movie I loved from the previews, but The Day After Tomorrow is a pretty standard disaster flick.  People who've seen the past disaster flicks would come to familiarize the formulas that this movie follows from Disasterology 101.  Big authority ignoring early warning signs of doom: check!  Pessimists are psychic of upcoming danger: check!  Catastrophe strikes during rush hour: check!  People making good use out of a bad situation: chii-eck!  It all follows the rules to make a disaster flick, and the executing is very average.  The movie also dulls down by being too predictable.  For example: in one scene, if a guy is hanging to dear life by a single rope to avoid a deadly fall, and two other guys were trying to pull the rope up, and one of the other guys said, "We're not gonna make it," what's the guy holding the rope going to do to help them?  I probably knew what you're gonna say.  I'm also a little annoy by movie's intentional tone in emotion; it starts off easy, then thrilling, then slow, thrilling again, sadness, shocking, slow, depressing, intense, and by the film's ending, uplifting.  Any movie (disaster or not) that ends uplifting from everything that's sad and climatic in the beginning is just being cheesy and not believable.<p>The Day After Tomorrow promised me social commentary(it said so on its official website), but what it got me is nothing but linear.  For what it's worth, though, this is the most realistic and practical disaster film I seen.  There's no aliens, big lizards, or 'the Earth's core' to rid the earth in a fake manner, this is hardcore catastrophe based on scientific theory that might be an actual fact.  The message and referential concept made this movie my favorite disaster film, next to "Airplane", but it doesn't excuse the fact that the movie is banal and its plot structure that acts like a 10-piece puzzle: easily put in together without putting much thought.  As I end my review, one question remains: is this movie a high-budget blockbuster, or a warning?  That's the question you must think for yourself.</p></body></html>

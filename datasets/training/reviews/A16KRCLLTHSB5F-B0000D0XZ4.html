I had blocked out the movie on the inbound trip with music, but I settled back to watch this, thinking it would provide some solid, if cheap, entertainment.<p>It did, and it didn't.<p>The superhero drama has always been associated (in my mind, and I think in general) with an upbeat, wholesome sort of ethos; everything is reduced to a black-and-white struggle between good and evil, and good almost always triumphs. The 'Spiderman' movie is the perfect example of this. I guess I should have kept in mind that the Hulk has always deviated somewhat from the formula, and this director takes that deviation to the extreme.<p>The plot of the movie is governed by Bruce Banner's father, a psychotic and manipulative scientist who completely surpasses the bounds of 'acceptable' mad science (not the elegant, plot-to-destroy-the-world type, but a total nut job). Banner suffers from a repressed childhood memory involving his father and mother, and its nature, when revealed, is about as unpleasant as you would have imagined. I'm not one to fault a movie for being distrubing - generally, I would enjoy it - but it seems so out of place here, in a movie where the other main atraction is a series of mindless fight scenes in which a giant green CGI-generated man does battle with the US Army. Another fight scene, more on the disturbing side, involves three truly grotesque genetically modified dogs, and it takes the Hulk _forever_ to pummel and beat them into submission. I don't know why I found this so disturbing, but I did. Aside from that incongruity, which I would consider a weakness, there are no really solid performances, and bits of cinemetogrpahic flair like overly-elaborate scene transistions seem completley unnecesary. I can't reccomend it very highly, but it does at least deserve credit for its unexpected angle.</p></body></html>

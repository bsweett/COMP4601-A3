The crew at Average Joe's are tight-knit and decide to enter a dodgeball tournament in order to win the $50,000.00 grand prize that will enable Peter to keep the gym open. Patches O'Houlihan then comes along to train the group of hopeless misfits for the tournament.<br /><br />The best character, of course, is Stiller's White Goodman character. Stiller really nails the role of someone whose ineptitude and artificiality will crack you up. You will love to hate White Goodman.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn plays off Ben Stiller extremely well, as usual. These two make a hell of a comic duo and I hope to see more from them in the future.<br /><br />This movie is pretty hilarious and I would certainly recommend it to any Ben Stiller or Vince Vaughn fans. Comedy fans in general will enjoy this film.</p></body></html>

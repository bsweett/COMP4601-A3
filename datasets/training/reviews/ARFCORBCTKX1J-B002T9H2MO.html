Though I liked "Moon", it's unlikely I'll ever watch it again.<br /><br />For at least the last 20 years, I've noticed an increasing affectlessness (lack of genuine emotion) in movies. Movies increasingly seem to be made by people who only know movies, who don't have any deep connection with "life".<br /><br />Steven Spielberg is arguably the poster boy for this sort of filmmaking. It isn't simply that most of his films have been "lightweight", but rather that too many of his films seem to be more about the subject of the film, or even its genre, than the characters in the story. ("War of the Worlds" is a particularly egregious example. The Classics Illustrated comic book actually conveyed more of the story's emotion.) And he's hardly the worst filmmaker in this regard.<br /><br />Directors and writers are more and more guilty of holding the characters "at arm's length". Filmmakers no longer seem much concerned with "connecting" with the audience. It's unfortunate that we have to watch /animated/ films (such as "Up!" or "Toy Story 3") to be moved in any deep way.<br /><br />This is the basic problem with "Moon". It has a far-fetched but not-bad premise -- which is revealed about a third of the way in, rather than coming as a lame surprise at the end -- but the writer and director don't do much with it. There is little attempt to get the audience deeply involved with Sam Bell's predicament, which is an existentialist one of "Who am I? Why am I here?". Perhaps the filmmakers didn't want to churn out an "in your face" story -- but they're being /paid/ to come up with something original. The result is that "Moon" doesn't ultimately engage the viewer on more than a superficial level.<br /><br />A good example of this failure occurs when GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey) approaches Sam while he's trying to enter a password. Is GERTY going to help Sam, or block him -- perhaps even kill him? The director fails to build up any real ambiguity about the situation. This is particularly surprising, as Kevin Spacey was clearly chosen for this role for his ability to alternate between (apparently) sincere and unctuous/slimy.<br /><br />I might as well continue kicking this down dog by complaining about the lack of scientific accuracy. There is no radiant sound in a vacuum, and when Bell drops the coffee cup, it falls as if it were in a 1-g field, not the 1/6-g field of the Moon. (I don't know how much this would have cost to animate in CG, but I doubt it would have blown the budget.) The miniatures are, by modern standards, terrible, mostly because the people making them have no understanding of scale.<br /><br />The R rating is not for the brief shot of Sam's substantial and well-shaped gluteus maximus (which might be present for the obvious joke), but for a dozen unnecessary F bombs. There is no reason otherwise that your teenage kids shouldn't see this film.<br /><br />Your call. I would rent before buying.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Elegy: Good to see Rocky Balboa one Last Time"></head><body><p>ROCKY BALBOA is a bit of an endearing film. It was good to see Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa, Burt Young as Paulie and Tony Burton as Duke (Rocky and Apollo Creed's trainer). Rocky had to give it one last shot and get it out of his system. It was well worth the elegiac journey. Rocky's fight scene in this Blu-ray edition should look fantastic since that sequence was shot with digital cameras.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Daredevil *Movie DVD* Both Original And Director's Cut."></head><body><p>I have Both DD Dvd Movies, The Original Double disc and the Director's cut. Garner is very Beautiful and as Electra very good, While Michael Clarke Duncan did a great job as Kingpin, It would have been better had it been true to the comic book. Surprisingly Ben Affleck Did A Great Portrayal of Matt Murdoch/Daredevil. and Collin Farrell As "Bullseye" is really good too. The Director's cut is just Coolio Added as a Story which could explain alot. Both versions are good. Buy both.</p></body></html>

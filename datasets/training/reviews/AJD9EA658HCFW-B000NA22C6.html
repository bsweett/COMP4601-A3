This is what the movie Secret Window is based on. What makes Secret Window so good is that the casting was very good. Johnny Depp leads the way with an great performance. Without Depp this movie would not be as good.<br />Overall if you like suspense/thriller movies Secret Window is worth your time.</p></body></html>

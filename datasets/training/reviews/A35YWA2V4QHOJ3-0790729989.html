<meta name="summary" content="Dantesque"></head><body><p>In this movie, Morgan Freeman plays a police officer (William Somerset) who is well-read (whoa!!).  Let me repeat that:  Morgan Freeman's character can tell the difference between the writings of Hesiod and the plays of Racine.  That his character is erudite is reason enough to rent this movie, regardless of whether or not you like thriller-type flicks.<p>Brad Pitt is excellent as Freeman's ignoramous partner, David Mills.  The plot has the two of them attempting to apprehend a felon who is every bit as learned as  detective Somerset.  Due to this, the movie is able to do what few other movies have ever done;  it delves into the morose Dantesque overtones of sin and punishment.  For a brief introduction to the works of Dante, visit this website:<p>http://users.erols.com/antos/dante/<p>Besides Dante Alighieri, the film also contains allusions to John Milton and Earnest Hemingway, among others.<p>Besides the intellectual apparatus of the movie, it is also worth seeing plotwise as well.  A great film, especially for lovers of literature.</p></body></html>

You get the point from start to finish, I don't know anyone in their right mind who would watch this a second time or buy it and own it no less.  It's ok for superficial entertainment value, ONLY IF you are extremely bored.  The story is just cut and paste, interchagable conspriacy, government secrets and cover up espionage humdrum, recylcled garbage we've all seen in hundreds of other films.  The repeating of the same actions and expecting different results in the end.  We have the stereotypical Lucy Lui type asain karate spy champion attached to her white master.  A souless portrayal now that's entertainment.  Bruce Willis at least had some snappy dialogue, the only good part of the movie for me.  I wonder what kind of people find these type of movies enjoyable.  The masses seem to love this stuff.  One last footnote, I worked on this film as movie extra and they treated us like garbage, and that's not why I'm hating on it. I just think it's a crappy movie.</p></body></html>

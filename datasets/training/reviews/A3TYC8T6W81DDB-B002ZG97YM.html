<meta name="summary" content="A superb film with gorgeous animation and an impactful story"></head><body><p>I grew up in a household that fully embraced things like mythical creatures. That's not to say that it caused me to believe unicorns actually existed or anything like that, but just that the idea was something imaginative and fun to think about rather than being evil and stupid or some nonsense. But dragons were always something we came back to. They've always been considered cool in my family. You could say that they were a big part of my childhood. While a film featuring dragons doesn't automatically make it a good one, How to Train Your Dragon managed to speak to that inner kid in me and always had the potential to be something extraordinary. Thankfully first impressions can be right every so often.<br /><br />Most DreamWorks Animation films are fairly lackluster at best outside of the first Shrek film and the Kung Fu Panda films. That along with the incredible reputation How to Train Your Dragon has (8.2 on IMDb, 74/100 on MetaCritic, 98% on Rotten Tomatoes) were both fairly overwhelming. There was no way this film could possibly live up to the praise and hype people were giving this thing. Well junior, my subconscious told myself after viewing the film, it is. So get over yourself.<br /><br />A strong point for any animated film is its animation, obviously. How well it's animated can be a major factor in the film being enjoyable or not, but How to Train Your Dragon delivers in every way imaginable. Colors are rich and motions are fluid; the water in the film looks incredibly realistic. I honestly wasn't a big fan of the human character designs at first. They seemed kinda childish, goofy, and underwhelming, but it really doesn't take long for them to win you over as each one of them has their own eccentric traits to give them likeable personalities. You get absorbed into this world and the island of Berk so easily, which is all any film should aim for. The film must look amazing on Blu-ray and must've been a glorious ride in theaters in 3-D.<br /><br />Hiccup's story is really the backbone of the film. It brings emotion, meaning, and most of all heart to what is otherwise just Vikings versus dragons up until that point. Hiccup's relationship with Toothless is what makes the film special. Their interactions with each other make you laugh at times and break your heart at others in a way that none of the rest of the film can really measure up to. And if none of that is able to win you over the scenes where Hiccup rides Toothless will. Just about everyone has dreamt of flying at some point. This throws you directly into that sensation and pulls it off flawlessly.<br /><br />How to Train Your Dragon is a truly spectacular animated film featuring fantastic animation and an engrossing story. Along with its engaging characters and an emotionally thrilling relationship between a boy and his pet, it's easily one of the best animated films of the past few years.</p></body></html>

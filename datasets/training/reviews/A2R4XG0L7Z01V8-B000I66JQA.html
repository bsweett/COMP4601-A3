Some people disagree with this. Personally, I like doing it. Plus, I like watching the "coming soon" trailers too - it always gives me an idea as to what DVDs to add to my wishlist etc.<br /><br />I watched The Hours with my Dad, and actually had to WAKE him up at the end - now he never falls asleep at movies. I do. What is The Hours about? Three women, with very little lives, and feeling trapped at every turn. Yes, there are also women kissing in this movie, for the guys - and girls I guess.<br /><br />I didn't identify with any of the women, I found the film quite dull, and uninteresting. It had so much promise. And I couldn't handle watching Ed Harris in his role - normally I love him too!<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie - maybe it's because I haven't read the book, I don't know. I'd be interested in reading the book, perhaps, but I still have quite a few books on my "to read" list. (Stop buying books and DVDs!) I'll still keep the DVD - after all it was only cheap, and if I ever read the book, I might give it another try again.</p></body></html>

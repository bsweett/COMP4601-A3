<meta name="summary" content=""I used to be smart. Now, I'm just stupid."  (4.5 stars)"></head><body><p>"Magnolia" is a long, depressing, sad, and tragic movie that is done in a very beautiful and unique way.  Very rarely does a film like this come by.  The film is complex, but it doesn't try to follow a basic plot structure.  Characters talk like real people, instead of just talking about things that center around the plot or point.  I do admit that the first time I saw this movie, I didn't really like it that much.  I knew that I didn't hate it, but it was something that I didn't really care for at the time.<p>I decided to re-evaluate it after seeing P.T. Anderson's masterpiece, "Punch-Drunk Love."  I fell in love with it immediately.  You know how all the critics were saying that seeing that movie really makes you want to re-evaluate Adam Sandler?  Well, I decided to do the opposite.  I was already impressed with Sandler long before that movie, so I decided to re-evaluate P.T. Anderson.  So, I decided to give "Magnolia" another chance.  And I am really glad, because this time around, I really enjoyed it.<p>The movie focuses around several different characters, who seem to have a connection somehow with one another.  It all takes place in the time frame of one day, and with that day comes revelations, strange situations, confessions, and redemption.  It's like a bunch of different stories, but they're all happening at the same time.  We keep going back from character to character.  Each character is either being troubled, hiding a dark secret, looking for some kind of redemption, running away from the past, or dying.  This film is about coincidence and chance; secrets and confessions; blame and forgiveness; sorrow and pain; and most importantly, redemption and rebirth.<p>There are so many different stars that were in this non-commercial film.  It really reminds you of the power that took place in Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction."  The cast includes such stars as Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy, Jason Robards, Julianne Moore, Jeremy Blackman, and many more.  They all do a fantastic job in this very difficult movie.<p>P.T. (Paul Thomas) Anderson is quite the writer/director.  He was able to make a very complex film that doesn't have to revolve around plot.  There isn't just one idea going around in the movie; there's dozens of them!  Each person who watches the movie is bound to take something different from it.  The writing and directing was really amazing.<p>The DVD has a few extras to offer.  Those extras are the "Frank T.J. Mackey seminar," the Mackey infomercial, a teaser and theatrical trailer, TV spots, the "save me" music video, and a documentary of the making of "Magnolia" that is over 70 minutes long!  The picture quality was very crystal clear and the sound was very high quality.<p>Be warned, this is not a film that everyone is going to like.  If you do not have the time nor patience, then do not attempt this one.  The film is 3 HOURS LONG!  That's right: 3 HOURS LONG!  It's a very depressing and tragic movie, but it is done in such an impressive and unique way.  If you want a movie with a point that is very clear, a very identifiable plot, or a quickly paced story, skip it.  Don't even bother putting this in your DVD player, or VCR player.  This is a film that you will either love it, or you will hate it.  Just be warned.<p>I am glad that I took the time to revisit this film.  I really did enjoy it more the second time around.  I wasn't prepared for a 3 hour long and depressing tragedy when I watched it the first time awhile back.  Now, I was able to let it soak inside my mind and fully appreciate it for what it was.  This is not a commercial-friendly film; this is not a film that is going to be loved by the majority; but to those who do end up enjoying it will be rewarded big time.  Overall, "Magnolia" is about second chances.  I am glad that I did just that, and gave it a second chance.  Maybe this is a film that the more you see it, the more you appreciate it.  A very, VERY impressive film from Mr. Anderson, indeed.</p></body></html>

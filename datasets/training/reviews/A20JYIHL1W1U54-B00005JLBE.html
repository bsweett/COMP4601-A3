<meta name="summary" content="Twenty First Century Bond"></head><body><p>DIE ANOTHER DAY catapults James Bond into the Twenty First Century. This movie is fast paced and cram packed with action on the land, in the sea and in the air. Pierce Brosnan is James Bond and he does it everywhere. Brosnan's Bond is more relaxed, confident and deadlier than all his previous outings as 007. The new Aston Martin has some really great innovations and plays a major part in the movie as its predecessor DB5 did in GOLDFINGER. That being said this film combines both the reality base of the recent Bond films with the larger than life plots for world domination from the older Bond films but with enormous amounts of technological advances added. The result is a whole new frenetic and furious look. David Arnold's pivital score as a whole reflects this new direction as he updates his approach to the music with increased electronic mind blowing audiotronics that really pushes the envelope. The movie's only shortcoming is Halle Berry as Jinx. Jinx is a bit of an enigma. Is she there as Bond's friend or foe? They really don't work together but instead just happen to be around to pull each other out of a jam. Jinx works for the NSA. It is clearly seen that the NSA and MI6 aren't exactly on congenial terms. The movie never really addresses any relationship between Bond and Jinx. That's one fault. Also, the villain's plot was a little uninspired since it involved a virtual duplicate of Blofeld's diamond refracting satellite from DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. However, DIE ANOTHER DAY does not fail to entertain and it delivers far more action than any other Bond film to date. Besides, it's the first time we get to see Bond smoke since LICENCE TO KILL!</p></body></html>

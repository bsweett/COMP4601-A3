<meta name="summary" content="Mary Poppins Review from The Massie Twins"></head><body><p>One of Disney's very best musicals, Mary Poppins is an unforgettable children's classic. It combines memorable songs that get stuck in your head with the forward and sarcastic dialogue of the unsurpassable Poppins, and a psychedelic story that employs superbly integrated traditionally animated characters. Part fairy tale, part daydream, and all magic, the sights, songs and laughs propel this Academy Award-winning picture (Andrews took home the Oscar for Best Actress, and the film was nominated for a whopping 13 golden boys - the most of any Disney film) to the top of the lists for the greatest family films ever made.<br /><br />The story begins with Bert (Dick Van Dyke) playing the role of guide and narrator, ushering the viewer to the home at 17 Cherry Tree Lane (as if inexperienced in the technique, the camera cuts on several occasions during the trip, taking the viewer out of the notion of following Bert). The sixth nanny in four months is about to dash out the door, upset at the constantly preoccupied Winifred Banks and her two misbehaving children who have once again gone missing. When Mr. George Banks (David Tomlinson) comes home, he's furious at the disorder, blames the kids and his wife, and insists upon personally hiring the next nanny. The two children, Jane and Michael, create their own list of requirements for the prospective woman, but George scoffs and throws the paper into the fireplace.<br /><br />The following morning, dozens of elderly ladies line the front yard, waiting for an interview for the newly open position. But with a powerful gust of wind, the lot of them is replaced by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews), who descends from the clouds with her umbrella and carpetbag and, mysteriously, the children's list of preferences. Banks is all seriousness and professionalism, but he's no match for the tricky verbal wizardry of Poppins, who not only hires herself, but initially agrees only to a trial run. After dismissing the befuddled man of the house, she slides up the staircase (in a peculiarly reverse Exorcist-like manner) to meet the children, and unpack her empty carpetbag (pulling out a hat rack, mirror, lamp and more).<br /><br />Poppins uses magic and singing (starting off with the very famous "A Spoonful of Sugar" song) to tidy up their room (tables, toys and doors all flap about in another playful scene reminiscent of The Exorcist), and the trio departs for the park. There they meet Bert, who is creating chalk masterpieces on the sidewalk, and with a little more magical help from Mary Poppins, embark on a fun-filled adventure into his artwork - firstly on a jolly holiday in a picturesque English countryside (the kids are curiously absent for the first two lengthy sequences with dancing penguins and barnyard animals) which segues into a merry-go-round horse ride through the park that transforms into a fox hunt and then a derby.<br /><br />At first it seems that practically perfect (and rather vain) Mary Poppins is there to straighten out the wily kids; as the film progresses it's evident that Mr. and Mrs. Banks are the ones she's there to fix; George is a well-ordered man absorbed with his work, and rarely has time for his children and their unseemly hullabaloo (or the sugary female thinking of his wife), while Winifred is leading women's rights movements - an act contrary to her subservient attitude toward her husband.<br /><br />A cheerful creativity surrounds the whole film, from the laugh-filled tea party on the ceiling of Uncle Albert's home, to the senile but punctual admiral who commands a ship atop his house, to the tongue-twisting silliness of "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious." The songs are some of the best in any of Disney's films, the mixing of traditional animation with the live action characters is fantastic, and Andrews' performance is (spit) spot-on. Although the running time is noticeably lengthy for a family film (the following year's The Sound of Music was, of course, even longer) and the scripting of Poppins changed drastically from the original story by P.L. Travers (for the better), it is one of the most memorable and delightful musicals from Walt Disney - one that hasn't aged and remains universally entertaining.<br /><br />- Mike Massie</p></body></html>

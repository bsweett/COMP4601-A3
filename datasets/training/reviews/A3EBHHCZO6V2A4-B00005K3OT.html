<meta name="summary" content="Hot Chocolate for the Soul"></head><body><p>Lasse Hallstrom's "Chocolat" is a richly delicious movie. Set in post-WWII France, Juliette Binoche is luminous as Vianne,a gipsy who works magic with her chocolate. Alfred Molina stars as the melancholy, repressed Comte who initiates a crusade against her in the name of morality. With Rachel Portman's sensuous soundtrack,"Chocolat" is a delicious treat.<br /><br />In "Chocolat",Vianne befriends the abused Josephine (Lena Olin) as well as the suffering Countess (Judi Dench),who's estranged from her uptight daughter Caroline (Carrie-Ann Moss). Vianne defiantly opens her chocolaterie during Lent. One can argue the premise is offensive-what if Vianne opened a hamburger shop in India,or sold pork in a Muslim country? Isn't Vianne being insensitive,or just adolescent? Vianne's chocolate shop ends up being a refuge and place of healing. Her chocolate is an aphrodisiac, spicing up a passionless marriage and jumpstarting a romance between an old widow (Leslie Caron) and a man who's pined for her since WWI. Johnny Depp leads the river pirates to the small French town. His name is Roux--so he's named for the butter-flour mixture that thickens soups. The plot thickens. In the meantime, the Comte is bullying the young priest. Doesn't he have anything better to do? To his credit, the Comte tries to reform Josephine's abusive husband Serge. As for the Countess, she is secretly suffering from diabetes and desires Death by Chocolate.<br /><br />Vianne decides to have a Chocolate Festival to counter Easter. After kneeling before a crucifix, the Comte finds Vianne's chocolate goddess on an altar surrounded by Mayan and Aztec images. He succumbs to the temptation of the chocolate, and everyone gets a Happily Ever After.<br /><br />"Chocolat" works as a light-hearted fable. It's sensuous and magical. It's delightful,fast-paced,and the ensemble cast is first-rate. One may disagree with the unrepentant,ungrateful Vianne,who doesn't thank the Divine for her healing gifts,or the fact that she doesn't know who her child's father is. Still, Vianne is compassionate and charitable. Even the villainous Comte has nuance,a man depressed from his wife's death. "Chocolat" is delicious. Succumb to the tasty temptation!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Watch it anyway"></head><body><p>I know many people, mostly women, who refuse on principle to watch Pulp Fiction. "It's too violent," they say, without even having seen it. And in several cases, these are the same women who love Carl Hiaasen's books. You want wacko violence? Read Hiaasen. Soooo, what's with not watching Pulp Fiction?<br /><br />Get over it. Watch it anyway. You won't regret it.<br /><br />For about ? of the movie, you just have to take it on faith that the seemingly random bits of action are eventually going to merge and make some sense - and of course they do. The business of waiting, however, is NOT boring; a little confusing maybe, but definitely not boring. There are such spectacular, tongue-in-cheek bits of acting, violence, insanity, horror that you can't take your eyes off the screen. Right now, one particular one comes to mind (no, no, not the one with the brain matter splattered throughout the car's interior): Bruce Willis knows this bad dude is being tortured in a basement dungeon by some even badder guys, and sort of against his better judgment he decides he's gotta do something about it, even tho the guy being tortured has been determined to kill him (Willis). So he's in this store on the main floor, looking for a weapon - and meanwhile you hear the horrible sounds of the guy to whom terrible things are being done - and Willis is taking his sweet time, weighing a big gun against a mace against a pistol against a cudgel against a - - -  Aha! At last, just when you're ready to scream "THE GUN, TAKE THE GUN" at him, he finds what he's looking for: a samurai sword. And off he trots to save his would-be assassin.<br /><br />And what a cast. In addition to Willis, you've got Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Keitel, Amanda Plummer, etc.<br /><br />Unbelievably terrific quirky wacko wild and wooly violent (yeah, it is violent) nutso twisted corrupt wicked hilarious top dog of a movie.</p></body></html>

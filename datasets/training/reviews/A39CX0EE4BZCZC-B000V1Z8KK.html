It looks like, as advertised, that if you enjoyed the "Bourne" movies ("The Bourne Identity" and "The Bourne Supremacy") you should like this and that was the case with me.  Mark Walhber's "Bob Lee Swagger" is a likable hero, a good guy in every sense. The first half included an interesting study on what it takes to be a good "sniper." It also had good photography.<br /><br />The second half of this made me wonder, "Who wrote this script? Oliver Stone? Michael Moore? The DNC? I couldn't believe all the politics - all the Liberal conspiracies and the anti-Bush Administration comments - in the last hour of this movie. First, this extreme paranoid view that everyone in the government is corrupt is vastly overworked by Hollywood and this movie is the topper where they aren't even subtle about these theories.  They turn a decent action thriller into one big Left Wing propaganda piece. What a shame. And how about those action scenes? Fifty trained guys and an armed helicopter against "Rambo" in here and guess who wins?<br />Stupid......really stupid.<br /><br />How a film can be so entertaining and somewhat intelligent and go down the dumper so fast and be so stupid in the second half is staggering.</p></body></html>

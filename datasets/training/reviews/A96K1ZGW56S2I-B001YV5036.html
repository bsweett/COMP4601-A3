During an era where boxing was the NBA-glamour sport of its time, Braddock was a promising up and coming fighter.  Not long after suffering from a damaging hand injury, the stock market crashed and so did Braddock's career.  He was eventually driven out of the ring and considered to be a wash-up.  But miracles really do happen (and not just on ice) and at the last moment, Braddock is recruited for a "one-time" appearance to fill in as a punching bag for a leading contender.  Only, the unexpected happens and the washed-up Jim Braddock wins his match.  In doing so, he captures the love of a nation and inspires its citizens during the darkest hours of the Great Depression.<br /><br />The acting performances in CINDERELLA MAN are quite remarkable.  Despite his bad-boy behavior, Russell Crowe is one of the most talented actors of the current age.  From L.A. CONFIDENTIAL to GLADIATOR and A BEAUTIFUL MIND, Crowe has displayed an almost uncanny ability to not only believable portray great characters, but make those characters appeal to the average man.  James Braddock was the Depression era Average Joe's role model and Crowe was perfectly cast for the role.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti once again returns to his roots of a supporting actor, portraying Braddock's longtime friend and manager, Joe Gould.  However, now that Giamatti has let his star shine, the light refuses to dim and his supporting role in the film turns Gould from being a supporting character to an essential role. Other mentionable performances are Renee Zellweger as Mae Braddock and Bruce McGill as boxing moneyman, Jimmy Johnston.<br /><br />Despite these fine acting performances, the movie does have some flaws.  Ron Howard can be a very talented director. However, there are times in CINDERELLA MAN where Howard chooses to go the less talented route of emotional appeal, rather than attempt something more powerful and dramatic.  For instance, building the audience up to suspect that Braddock is on the verge of leaving his family after Mae sees a man in the street walking away from his screaming wife.  The movie also has some cinematography elements that seem out of place, e.g. and overuse of shadow and an extensive use of panning.<br /><br />Nevertheless, CINDERELLA MAN is a powerful film.  In fact, other than FIELD OF DREAMS, it is the only sports movie that has made me cry.  Not only that, but the "tire-cam" that was invented during the course of the filming allowed for some of the most realistic boxing shots to appear in a movie since RAGING BULL.<br /><br />As a piece of triva,  Braddock's opponents in the ring were played by professional boxers who on occasions, accidently knocked Crowe out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Much to my surprise, I very much enjoyed this -- a spoiler free review"></head><body><p>I have to confess to two things at the outset.  First, I am part of the legions of moviegoers who have had their fill of Tom Cruise.  While many have recently joined on the bandwagon, I have had trouble with Mr. Cruise for a very long time.  Part of my difficulty has been with his espousal of a set of beliefs that I honestly believe were made up as a hoax by their originator, but part of it has been that he essentially always plays the same character.  He plays that one character very well, but they all seem to have close to the same personality.  Second, I'm pretty much at the burn out point on action spectaculars.  I'm tired of films that try to top all previous films with the size of the action sequences, in originality of stunts, and the amount of sheer noise.<br /><br />Despite these two misgivings, I have to confess that I very much enjoyed this film.  While I'm burned out on action films, this one at least tries to balance the action with genuine character development.  And unlike the vast majority of action films, it attempts to tell a real story, instead of just throwing the hint of a story at us that serves to frame the succession of stunts and special effects.  And while most action and espionage films try to throw surprises at us, this one's surprises did genuinely surprise.  Because a lot of the joy of the film lies in the various surprises, I won't delve at all into the plot or story.  Let me just say that for the most part it is an intelligent and entertaining film.<br /><br />The film is well directed and J. J. Abrams has to be given kudos for that.  For some time now I have wondered if Abrams's talents weren't better suited for film.  Though celebrated for his work on TV, not many have noted that his first two series -- FELICITY (whose star Keri Russell appears in this film) and ALIAS -- started off great but ended up weakly.  It is like Abrams has a talent for developing a premise, but has difficulty in long-term execution.  Contrast this with Joss Whedon, whose shows stay strong until the end.  And after the first six episodes of Season Three of LOST, one wonders of this show is suffering the same fate as Abrams's other shows.  Kierkegaard said that the challenge was how to continue a good beginning, and while that is certainly true of living life, it also applies to TV.  But while Abrams seems to struggle with long format television, film has no long format.<br /><br />The cast is for the most part solid without being spectacular.  Ving Rhames, Keri Russell, Billy Crudup, Laurence Fishburne, and the others all do a solid turn in their respective parts.  The one performer who stands out, as he almost always does, is Philip Seymour Hoffman, who despite what would seem to be a limiting physique apparently has no limits as an actor.  If someone were unfamiliar with his work were shown this film alongside CAPOTE, BOOGIE NIGHTS, THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY, and FLAWLESS, they might have trouble grasping that it was the same actor in each film.<br /><br />I did like and do recommend this film, but again I must confess my weariness with the whole action genre.  It is nearly fifty years since Guy Debord coined the expression and published his manifesto THE SOCIETY OF THE SPECTACLE.  Nowhere does this seem more apt than in the action film.  While M.I. 3 actually had some story to go with the spectacle, this is becoming more and more rare.  Too many films have almost no story and character development at all, instead relying exclusively on spectacle, as if that were all a film need be.  Though perhaps not enough people would agree with me, I would prefer that all of today's espionage films try to emulate THE THIRD MAN.  It had little action, no real special effects, but utterly riveting dialogue, visuals, and character development.  But as much as I might wish that, I suspect that the future is going have more rather than less spectacle.</p></body></html>

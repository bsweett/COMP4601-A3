<meta name="summary" content="too bad the video transfer isn't as good as the movie"></head><body><p>Okay, we all know that this multiple Oscar-winning film is wonderful on all levels, but be forwarned:  the video transfer to DVD pales in comparison to the laser disc collector's edition from several years ago.  The sound is fine, and you certainly better have a good sound system to  take full advantage, but the picture isn't as great as it should be.  Granted, it is at LEAST as good as the best VHS copy you will ever watch,  but it lacks the THX treatment the $150.00 laser disc edition got, and boy  is THAT worth every cent! A great transfer, running commentary by Milos  Forman and Peter Shaffer, hour-long documentary, and several deleted  scenes.  Until such a time as that version is released on DVD (and I hope  it will be someday), your DVD copy of &quot;Amadeus&quot; will not be the  best copy available.  And the laser disc edition came with the soundtrack  CD's in 24 karat bit somethingorother, which I believe is the best version  commercially available.  A treasure!  So buy the DVD so you can have a  good copy of this film, but keep your eyes peeled for the THX version, with  bonus features, if it ever becomes available.  Then buy that.</p></body></html>

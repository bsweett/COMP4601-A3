<meta name="summary" content="I Can't Take My Eyes Off of You"></head><body><p>"And so it is<br />Just like you said it would be<br />Life goes easy on me<br />Most of the time<br />And so it is<br />The shorter story<br />No love, no glory<br />No hero in her sky<br /><br />I can't take my eyes off of you<br />I can't take my eyes off you<br />I can't take my eyes off of you<br />I can't take my eyes off you<br />I can't take my eyes off you<br />I can't take my eyes..."  song and lyrics by Damien Rice. It plays through-out the movie, and the voice and melody bring a surreal quality to a movie that is so stark and real that it leaves you breathless at times.<br /><br />Directed by Mike Nichols, "Closer" the movie, tells in bits and pieces the lives of four people during four years. We see flashbacks that interpose with present day and leave us a little surprised at how easily we adapt. Alice (Natalie Portman) and<br />Dan (Jude Law) become lovers following a chance meeting on a street in London. She is a stripper/waitress, and he is writer/obituary writer. They move on from day to day until Dan meets Anna (Julia Roberts), a photographer of strangers. He becomes obsessed with her and wants to have an affair.  Anna rebuffs him, and he pays her back with a funny internet porn site meeting. Anna meets Larry (Clive Owen) a dermatologist at The Aquarium, and they begin a love affair. At some point these two couples become intertwined while Anna and Dan fall in love,  This movie belies  passion, heartbreak, anger, sadness, vengeance, pleading, deception, and most importantly, brutal honesty. It's only when you're more than halfway through the movie that you realize this is a movie that wraps all of your worst nightmares into one story. Larry loves Anna, Anna loves Dan, Alice loves Dan, and Alice once loved Larry.  How does this all come around to make any sense? The betrayals of each of the four are so strong that you wonder how any can recover. The anger and loss so extreme that how can love ever enter their lives again?<br /><br />Julia Roberts is a marvel in this move, so serene, so lovely, and so stark. Jude Law plays the devil and the damned; bringing a bruised ego to the fore and such a cad! Clive Owen plays the man who is most intricate; so removed and so near, so full of deceit and anger. But it is, Natalie Portman who plays the woman most abused and most full of her self and her destiny and sure of whom she is and who will not settle for less. This is a movie to be remembered.<br /><br />If you believe in love at first sight, you never stop looking.<br /><br />If you believe in love at first sight... Take a closer look<br /><br />Those who love at first sight are traitors at every glance. (Italy)<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob</p></body></html>

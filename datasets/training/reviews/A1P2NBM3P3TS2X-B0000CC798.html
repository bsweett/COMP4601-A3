<meta name="summary" content="Decent, but somewhat uninvolving"></head><body><p>First off, it is nice to see the introduction of several new mutant characters in this film.  But motion pictures can never match comic books in scale, imagination, and narrative tightness and efficiency.  Thus is the underlying problem with the "X-Men" movies.<p>In "X2", we find our reluctant heroes under attack by a rogue General Stryker (Brian Cox, the ORIGINAL Dr. Hannibal Lecter on film) and the Xavier School/Institute/whatever forcibly attacked.  The Xavier school, if you remember from the first movie, is a prep school-cum-mutant training academy for good-looking, upper-middle-class mutant kids.<p>On the run, the X-men must keep themselves and the students safe yet find who is behind the attack and why.  Magneto and Mystique join forces with our heroes for a while, and that stretches credibility just a bit.  Did I just use the word "credibility" in a review of a movie about mutant superheroes?<p>The movie is mostly a series of action setpieces, some Wolverine history uncovered, and spiffy effects.  But the story never really gets you too involved or interested.<p>I'm not saying you should NOT see it, but be aware that any movie franchise that wants to be all things to all people is bound to disappoint on multiple levels.<p>On the positive side, Mystique is given much more to do (and the sequence where she plants the seeds for Magneto's eventual escape from his plastic prison is pleasingly clever), new movie character The Nightcrawler as played by Alan Cumming is a fun visual treat, and you get plenty of bang for your buck with the movie's 133 minute running time.<p>Oh, yeah.  One of the X-Men from the first movie dies.  You'll have to see it to see which one.  But that part of the film was also the weakest.  With all of these incredible superpowers these mutants have, and their proven ability to emerge unscathed from just about any situation, logic dictates that it would take quite an incredible life-or-death situation to kill one of them.  And the one in the movie that results in so-and-so's death doesn't quite live up to that.</p></body></html>

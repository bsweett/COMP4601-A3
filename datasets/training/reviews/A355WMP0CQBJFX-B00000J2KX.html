<meta name="summary" content="HELL'S HOTEL"></head><body><p>the shining is by far one of the best bone chilling movies. so good, so sinister, and jack nicholson is superb. stephen king does it again, what can i say the man is a genius. it doesn't hurt that jack is a great actor either. just goes to show what a little cabin fever, and an evil hotel, in an isolated mountain can do to a person, and a family. what is real what isn't. who can you trust, where do you go when you're all alone? just imagine yourself in a huge hotel, where no one can hear you scream, where no one can find you, where although you're alone, always feel that someone is just right behind you. where things far worse than even your worse nightmares are real. what does it take to make you lose your mind. it's everything about this movie that will make your skin crawl.</p></body></html>

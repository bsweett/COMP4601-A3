After hearing tags like "film of the year" I decided to give it a watch. I was not one bit disappointed but it truly is possibly the best film you will see in the three star category. It is somewhere along the lines of a new age fight club mixed with some tarantino aping direction. Despite the similarities, it somehow manages to remain original.<br /><br />I fell in love with Lucy Liu in this film. Josh Hartnett can definitely act. Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis have definitely done better films with better roles. This film has a certain grip value to it which makes it highly watchable and non sleep inducing. Another film I watched right after watching Slevin was "hostel" Kill me but I liked it more. Both are good films. I'd give that four stars though.<br /><br />Fans of Seven will like this film quite a bit. Fans of Taxi Driver should keep looking. Fans of Kill Bill give it a shot. Fans of Oldboy...geez! we need to wait :)</p></body></html>

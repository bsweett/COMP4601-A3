<meta name="summary" content="A True Horror Film"></head><body><p>The best movie monsters have always been ones that are the most human, and Brian DePalma's powerful adaptation of Stephen King's bestseller &quot;Carrie&quot; features some of the most vile to ever fill the screen.  Selfish, sadistic, arrogant, violent, and senseless, the teenagers that torment Carrie White (an outstanding Sissy Spacek) deserve their punishment--and more--and DePalma milks every drop of sympathy for Carrie and animosity for them possible.  Unlike so many DePalma films (&quot;The Untouchables&quot; being a notable exception), &quot;Carrie&quot; builds to its climax with a natural sense of inevitability, making the tragedy that ensues all the more devastating.  By now, the plot is well known; a misfit with budding telekinetic powers struggles with puberty, a cruel religious zealot of a mother (Piper Laurie), and a high school populated by representatives of everything that is despicable about humanity (or European-American culture, as none of the major players is an ethnic minority and the social commentary is rather obvious).  When the full extent of her powers are realized, Carrie cleans house, sparing neither the guilty nor the innocent.  (Even a well-meaning teacher ignorant of Carrie's true powers is not spared.)  DePalma gives the film a dreamy sensibility, and now that the music and fashion have returned somewhat, &quot;Carrie&quot; does not seem as dated as it was even a few years ago.  Special mention goes to John Travolta, Nancy Allen, and P.J. Soles for being so effectively rotten (their glee when slaughtering a pig is especially creepy); their villainy is far more chilling than the paint-by-numbers variety that most actors portray.  And what of Carrie, herself?  The film correctly leaves that up to us to decide.</p></body></html>

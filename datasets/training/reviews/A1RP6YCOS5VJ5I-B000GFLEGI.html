<meta name="summary" content="What plot?"></head><body><p>Land of the Dead has to be the worst out of all of Romero's "Dead" films. There is no plot hardly at all, and a lot of plot holes at that. Why are the zombies after Dennis Hopper? How do they know who he is? Those are just a couple of question out of the movie that are left unanswered. The only reason to watch the movie is to see zombies eat and destroy, but how many movies have we seen that are like that? This movie offers nothing new and is the same old thing that has been done a million times. We have even seen a zombie figure out how to use weapons on Day of the Dead, so zombies using weapons on here was nothing new either. Good special effects and a cameo by Tom Savini are the only thing that this movie worth watching. Everything else is very forgettable and not really worth watching again</p></body></html>

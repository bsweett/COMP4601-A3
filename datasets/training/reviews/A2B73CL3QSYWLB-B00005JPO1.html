<meta name="summary" content="Indy Returns With a Bang"></head><body><p>This flick is helped immensely by diminished expectations.  Going into it I felt this was going be a cynical effort seeing that the series promised to conclude twenty years ago with "The Last Crusade".  I was ready to tag the movie "Geritol Jones".  That said, messrs. Lucas, Spielberg, and Ford have revisited the series and have delivered a wholly satisfying entry.  While not as fast paced as "Raiders of the Lost Ark" it has slowed down rhythms probably in deference to Harrison Ford's age.  Though not as quick with the whip as he once was Ford floats by on his familiar charisma.  It was great to see Karen Allen back as Marion Ravenwood, the only femme fatale worthy of Indy.  Allen doesn't seem to have aged in thirty years.  Cate Blanchett is deliciously villainous as a Russian baddy recalling Beloque from "Raiders".  Great closing shot that suggests the direction the series may or may not go.  Only sin is it doesn't reach the heights of the original but in the spirit of the season I'm giving it the full five star treatment.</p></body></html>

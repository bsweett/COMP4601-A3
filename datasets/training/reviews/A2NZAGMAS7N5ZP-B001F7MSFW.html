<meta name="summary" content="Even More Reder Than Before...But Better?..hmm"></head><body><p>I for one liked the first Hellboy..but this sequel was a mixed bag for  me.On one hand it stands out as a very effective creepy horror/superhero movie;giving the audience a better look at the creatures this time..with out the use of CGI..which to me that was fantastic. So what exactly is the problem here..well the story  felt a bit forced at times. I didnt feel there was a need for a sequel in the first place..it was pretty much a sequel to get fans to watch.<br /><br />  the movie is not horrible,no that not what I said,its pretty descent..but its just theres nothing new to bring about Hellboy,sure he is back with that big gun and evrything, he is still with Liz from the first movie..so what? I wanted to see the Golden army..and all I got was 5 min..at the end. There are good moments like the fight with Prince Nuada and the gaurds..cool right?..but the rest is like..ugh, not the mention the silly love story between Abe Sapien and the Princess...very ludricous and unecessary. not the best movie this year<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 OUT OF 5</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Final Destination 3: 3 Times The Stupidity, 3 Times The Lameness"></head><body><p>James Wong comes back as the director in this movie, he directed the first one which was the only good one out of the series and this one doesnt even compare to the first one, neither does the awfully idiotic 2nd Final Destination with that laughable Ali Larter death sequence...here, there's a laughable sequence in which 2 prissy girls (played by Crystal Lowe and Chelan Simmons) who are in a tanning booth and a piece of wood gets stuck in between them.....which was reatarded at best. So, here goes the story, a girl named Wendy, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead (The Ring Two, Sky High) has a premonition about the roller coaster that she is about to ride which goes crazy and everyone dies. Her and some other people get off the roller coaster and it suddenly happens. Kevin, played by Ryan Merriman (The Ring Two, Halloween: Resurrection) tells Wendy about a kid who 6 years ago foresaw a plane blowing up and everyone started to die afterwards. Wendy doesnt believe him until she actually sees it. So, Wendy and Kevin go around trying to warn everyone who was on the roller coaster and eventually they all die one by one. Horrible to put it to you clear, will serve up something for the people who love to see teenagers kick the bucket in different ways. Best line in the movie: "FU Ben Franklin" but besides that, it's slightly better then the second one but it is still a bad movie. Also starring Kris Lemche (Knockaround Guys, Ginger Snaps), Alexz Johnson (Selling Innocence, Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical), Texas Battle (One Tree Hill, Coach Carter), Sam Easton (The Butterfly Effect, Underclassman) and Amanda Crew (Smallville, 15/Love). They played "Roller Coaster" and " Love Train".....wow! Leaves it open for another....if so, I aint seeing it.</p></body></html>

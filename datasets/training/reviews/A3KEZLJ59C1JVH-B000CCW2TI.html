<meta name="summary" content="Not half bad"></head><body><p>"Red Eye" is a fast-paced thriller directed by Wes Craven, who also directed the fabulous "Scream" trilogy. In "Red Eye," a young hotel manager named Lisa (Rachel McAdams) is kidnapped by a man (Cillian Murphy) she encounters on a late flight to Miami. The strange man is part of a plot to assassinate a Homeland Security official (Jack Scalia) at the hotel where Lisa works. Lisa is instructed to call the hotel and arrange to have the government official's room switched, making it easier for the assassination plot to be carried out. There's a hit man sitting outside the home of Lisa's father, and if Lisa refuses to comply with her hostage, her father will be killed.<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty decent movie. It clocks in at only 85 minutes long, which is brilliant: Craven constantly keeps the action moving, and there isn't a dull moment in the film. Both McAdams and Murphy deliver excellent performances in their roles and have great onscreen chemistry together. I was pretty turned off by almost every other actor in the film, though: all the other performances seemed very overdone, which must have been a deliberate choice on Craven's part, but I found it kind of annoying.<br /><br />This is an entertaining and suspenseful film. It's not up there with my favorite thrillers of all time and I doubt I'll ever watch it again, but "Red Eye" kept me thoroughly entertained for 85 minutes of my life.</p></body></html>

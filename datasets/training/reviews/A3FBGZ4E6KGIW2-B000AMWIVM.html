<meta name="summary" content="I went, I "Saw"..I hated."></head><body><p>I'm probably going to get my share of flack from others on this site after they read this review, but I'm going to voice my opinion anyway.  I'm being completely honest in everything I say here.  I just viewed this earlier today at my local theater and it has to be the biggest letdown for me out of all the movies that I have seen this year.  To me, Saw has a weak and uninteresting plotline with a bunch of horrific actors weaved into it.  Cary Elwes was completely unconvincing in this picture (I've never seen him in others, so I'm only going by his performance here) When the film first started, I wasn't getting into it then, but I decided to wait it out, hoping that things would pick up by mid picture, but sadly to report, it did not.  I wasn't scared at all, I was disinterested.  I was so bored, I couldn't wait to get out of the theater.  I wasn't the only one.  I was the only one left in the theater because everyone was walking out (I never walk out of films, but I REALLY wanted to).  I heard one comment as a dad and his son were exiting: "this is too long." I also agree, what was shown here could have been accomplished in less than an hour and forty minutes.  The concept of using Jigsaw to freak people out may work with young kids, but it didn't work with me.  I was completely unaffected by this picture, psychological thriller/horror or whatever genre would be the appropriate placing for this.  I did get the message out of this as some people are stating in their reviews, but did they really have to put it in such an overrated and dreadful film? I think this movie gives psychological thrillers a bad name.  I've seen some exceptionally wonderful films in that genre, including One Hour Photo.  I wouldn't recommend this picture to anyone, rental or otherwise.  I firmly believe it's a big waste of money and time.  It sure was for me, at least.  I had to chuckle to myself when "game over" was said-I was counting my lucky stars that I didn't have to sit through that "game" any longer. I've never seen any of the movies that this has been compared to (mostly speaking of Seven here) but I'm sure those movies are much better in storyline and acting than this (I honestly doubt it could be worse)</p></body></html>

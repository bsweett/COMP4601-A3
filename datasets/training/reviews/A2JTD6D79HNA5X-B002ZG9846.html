Kick-Ass is a great action film about people wanting to be superheros and the few who actually do. The action is wilded and the main nerdy guy who pretends to be gay so he can hang with the girl he wants who always wanted a gay friend was funny. Nicolas Cage is good as the "batman" hero and the dude from Superbad who played the evil guy was good too. It has a great opening and the film doesn't let up at all.</p></body></html>

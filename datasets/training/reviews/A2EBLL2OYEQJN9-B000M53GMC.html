<meta name="summary" content="Sets the gold standard for Bond flicks and the spy film genre"></head><body><p>Goldfinger is one of the most recognized and celebrated Bond films, starring the charming, confident, brilliant, and suave Connery as 007, a man every male viewer wants to be and every female viewer wants to be with.  We've got the over-the-top villians in the form of the filthy rich, despicable, and card-cheating Goldfinger and his bulky henchman Oddjob.  We've got the alluring female (not a pawn, but a powerful woman) played by Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore.  And, of course, the gadgetry, ranging from lasers to the tricked out Aston-Martin with an ejection seat (and more) to Goldfinger's plane to Oddjob's lethal black hat.<br /><br />Anyone who was introduced to Bond via the movies of the 1990's and 2000's should return to this classic (the third Bond movie in a list that will reach 21 with 2006's release of Casino Royale) to see where it all came from.  The later Bond movies skimp on plot and go for awe-inspiring death-defying tricks whenever possible.  Goldfinger has some great tricks, of course, but also excellent dialogue and a well-crafted plot.</p></body></html>

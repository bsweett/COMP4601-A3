Our grumpy old man has a name, Carl, and it turns out he's not so grumpy after all - but he has suffered a terrible and heart-wrenching loss. Pixar is to be congratulated for managing, again, to really flesh out a character in scenes that involve little-to-no actual dialogue, and in such a surprisingly short time - after the first 15 minutes of the film, I can almost guarantee you will care more about Carl than you have for the protagonists of the last dozen films you've watched. (OK, mileage will vary there, but seriously, Pixar does a wonderfully direct and succinct job of making you care for Carl as a person.)<br /><br />There's so much to like about "Up". There's such a strong theme here of journeying to capture what you "lost", even if what you're trying to capture is something you never actually had. His tag-along friend, Russell, is also searching for something he has lost-yet-never-had, as he hopes that by finishing his merit badges, he might somehow regain the love that he remembers having from his father. If that doesn't break your heart, then nothing will. And the comic relief, Dug the Dog, is actually funny and heart-warming as well.<br /><br />To my surprise, I really, really enjoyed "Up". I'm not quite sure how to rate it, though - I'm very glad that I've seen it, but...I strangely don't feel the need to re-watch it, which is unusual for me. Maybe it's just that "Up" burns itself into your memory so indelibly, or maybe it's just because it's a real tear-jerker, and I hate to cry, but for whatever reason, I'd recommend this as a rental first, and not necessarily a buy. Not because the movie isn't wonderful - it is! - but because "Up" might leave such a strong impression on you that you might not *need* to see it again... at least not without a box of tissues nearby.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></body></html>

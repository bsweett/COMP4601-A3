<meta name="summary" content="Bruce Willis stills has "it"!"></head><body><p>I must say that although there were some incredible stunts and unrealistic scenes in the movie, I still thrilled in the fact that this was a well thought out, action, adventure story with a hero that I could believe. I love Bruce Willis and that crooked smile (I definately see what would attract Demi Moore) and his sense of taking a beating and keep on coming. Although John McClane was older and grumpier, he can take a punch or kick with the best of them. This installment in the Die Hard series finds John struggling to maintain his relationship with his college aged daughter. He has moved from being his daughter's hero, to being a disappointment. As he attempts to mend their relationship, he is also thrust into a situation where he has to save the life of a hacker. This story is filled with situations, that some would say are unrealistic, but that I say should give us food for thought. What would happen if there is a cyberattack and every industry that means something is effected? Finance, transportation, communications, and utilities. What if there were a firesale? Are we as Americans really ready? When John unravels the mystery of who is behind this mess, we find a bad guy and a bad, but beautiful girl. I really enjoyed this story and found it to be extremely entertaining. I even bought it to watch over and over on lazy Sunday afternoons.</p></body></html>

The truth is, this film is good awful.<br /><br />Bill Murray takes his Lost in Translation, emotion dead character to further extremes.  It's almost like watching the Weekend with Bernie, dead guy, visiting his four ex's of a certain time to find out which one sent the letter telling about a son he has sired twenty years before.  Don Johnston is sort of a Don Juan, but we never see his talents as a Romeo, but rather, we see the results.<br /><br />Go ahead; suddenly show up at an ex-lover's door twenty years after the fact.  What's their reaction?  Sharon Stone jumps back into bed with him.  Her daughter is Lolita.  Then he visits the Real Estate woman.  Are the pearls she's wearing the one's he gave her?  Julie Deloy plays it deliciously restrained; yet, she is very attractive for a middle-age gal.  Her husband is a silver-fox fake. Then there's the pet whisperer.  She's a bitch. Then there's the biker girl with a real bad attitude, but watch out for her boyfriends.<br /><br />Yes, there's too many shots of Murray just sitting there, but there are also true shots of kitch Americana.  You must have an IQ over 120 to view this material.</p></body></html>

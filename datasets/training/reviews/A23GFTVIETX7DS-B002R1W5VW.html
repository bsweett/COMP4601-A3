<meta name="summary" content="Nicholas Cage at his best"></head><body><p>This cross between "The Sting" and "Paper Moon" pits master con artist Roy (Nicholas Cage) against himself.  He has the smooth moves, the grasp of the intricate game he must play, the equally smooth partner (Sam Rockwell), but he cannot master his own obsessive-compulsive urges which manifest themselves in agoraphobia, tics, and, at times, full paralysis.  When his partner Mark insists that he sees a shrink for his problems, Roy makes halting progress, leading to his discovery of his previously unknown teenage daughter Angela (Alison Lohman.)  What happens next is both hilarious and heartbreaking as Cage exposes his character's heart tic by tic during his biggest con scheme yet.  <p>I cannot fault a single performance in this film.  No one plays comedic pathos the way Cage does, and he is at his absolute best here - even non-fans might be converted.  Supporting actress Alison Lohman's performance is bubbly, nuanced, and adorable, making Roy's instant affection for Angela completely believable.  The direction, screenplay, and other supporting performances add yet another layer of perfection to the film.  This is the kind of movie you can watch several times before you get enough of it.</p></body></html>

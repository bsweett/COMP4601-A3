<meta name="summary" content="Excellent  film based on exceptional novel"></head><body><p>This film is based on one of the finest novels written in the last 20 years. Because of the beauty and power of the book, I was concerned that the film would not be able to capture the depth, romance, tragedy, and meaning of the book. I must say, the film does a great job. The acting is superb and Kira Knightly provides one of her most powerful performances to date. Three actresses play the role of her younger sister, Briony, each capturing the internal dynamics of this conflicted character at various stages of her life. I say `conflicted' because at each stage of her life in the film Briony is undergoing some internal and external turmoil.<br /><br />The elegant English country house with its Triton fountain; the sandy beaches of Dunkirk filled with the horrors and chaos of thousands of wounded English soldiers without leadership, water, food or hope; the tragic army hospital fully of the suffering, maimed and dying; and the chaos of London during the air war; all of these come vividly alive in the film.<br /><br />The actors engaged in character development of the highest level. The characters are seen in both romantic and tragic situations. The film's sense of history, especially warfare, and the effects of history on the individual's life trajectory is superb.  The film also captures all the signs of classism and its destructive forces. In some ways it is classism that has separated Cecelia and Robbie at college and it is classism that is one of the barriers to their romance. It is also classism that contributes to Robby's imprisonment since those persons in the film guilty of crimes would rather see a poor boy imprisoned rather than risk any loss of face. The depiction of the horrors of war was moving.  The dead and dying are seen in general during sweeping shots of battlefield and hospital, and in particular tragedy such as Robbie's discovery of the mass grave of French school girls or Briony's last conversation with a young French soldier who was missing half his skull.<br /><br />Rather than discuss the plot which you will see by watching the film, I would prefer to discuss the themes that the film explores with great insight.<br /><br />The first theme that I found engaging was that of maturity of emotion and development of personal character/courage, as exemplified in the character of Briony. What is it within us that matures? Briony finds that with time her emotions mature, allowing her to turn down college and to engage as a nurse probationer in an army hospital in the middle of war-torn London. Her sister Cecelia is also serving as a nurse in London. At night in the hospital attic Briony writes her first novel "Two Figures at a Fountain". The creative impulse must also undergo maturation. Movement toward the state of artistic control means curtailing and directing the imagination, rather than allowing it to run wild. Briony at first does not understand this lesson and many of the people she loves most are punished as a result. It is important, in regard to understanding this film, that imagination creates the tragedy.<br /><br />The second theme I found engaging was the effects of classism, a social structure that acts as a barrier but can be overcome by those with courage and compassion. Cecelia and Robbie's love was first impeded by class until a happy accident allows Cecelia to understand the level of passion that Robbie secretly holds for her. Passion can move us beyond social definitions and confinements and toward a more authentic life. When Robbie accidently sends the obscene note to Cecelia, its authenticity breaks every barrier and releases them to experience pent up and held back affections and passions. The note, with its direct crude language, hits Cecelia almost like Zen enlightenment, revealing to her all that she had felt but hidden under a veneer of social control.<br /><br />The third theme I found engaging was that of the nature of atonement itself. Atonement has both internal and external manifestations, depending on whether the transgression has damaged the self or others or both. Briony makes both an internal atonement as she pursues life as a nurse, treating the horribly wounded soldiers. But she also makes an external atonement as she attempts to rectify the damage she has done. She does this through fiction, through imaginative narrative.<br /><br />Maturity means foresight into the consequences of our decisions and actions and this force is hopefully paired with growing character which is the willingness to accept responsibility for those decisions and actions when they go astray. Thus experience that results in increased control of emotion, forethought, and assuming responsibility when wrong are those forces that bring about a healthy maturity with corresponding character development. The film develops this theme beautifully, even to the final scenes of the film, where the elderly Briony, played by Vanessa Redgrave, reflects on this process that she underwent so many years before and the way that she has constructed atonement for herself and those she loved and lost. I was imagination that created the tragedy and it is imagination that brings about the atonement.<br /><br />Very few works of literature are as profound, moving, and sublime as the original novel. The film captures this world with rare power, grace and beauty.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Da Vinci Code gets the royal Blu treatment w/ an extended cut of the film and great supplimental material!!!"></head><body><p>The Da Vinci Code is making it's debut on Blu Ray and I'm loving it,it has the extended cut of the film,making a long film even longer,the theatrical was 149 min.,this extended cut is 174 min.,so you'll need a nice block of time to see this one,being that the new extended cut is almost 3 hours long,that's not counting the nice supplimantal section(this is a 2 disc set mind you!)There more added to the storyline,now i'm ready to see Angels & Demons!!! My only quibble is they could have put BOTH Theatrical and Extended versions on the same Blu Ray disc,that's my only gripe,and a small one at that!!! This is one example that the extended version is actually better that the theatrical(just wish that LOTR was getting the extended treatment for it's debut on Blu!) Recommended!!! A+</p></body></html>

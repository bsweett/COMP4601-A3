<meta name="summary" content="Classic Animated Film Gets Classic DVD Treatment"></head><body><p>First of all, this comes in Widescreen or Fullscreen. You chose when you hit play.  This was the first animated film to be made in 2.35 aspect ratio.<br /><br />Aurora is the first child of the king and queen.  There is a royal baby shower and everyone is invited except the evil witch Maleficent.  The first two fairies give Aurora her gifts when Maleficent arrives and gives Aurora her gift, "She will prick her finger on a spindle and die."  As Maleficent has the strongest magic, the final fairy, Merryweather, cannot change it but modifies it to she will sleep until awaken by true love's kiss.<br /><br />To prevent this from coming true, the king burns all spinning wheels and sends Aurora to be raised by the fairies in the forest.  Aurora grows up as Briar Rose and just before her 16th birthday she meets a gallant stranger in the forest.  Thinking it is safe, Aurora goes home and there is a big party for her.  Maleficent fulfills her curse.  To spare the kingdom the loss, the fairies cast a spell across the entire land putting everyone to sleep until Aurora awakens.<br /><br />As it turns out, the man in forest is Prince Philip, Aurora's betrothed.  And it is his kiss will wake her up.<br /><br />This is a beautiful classical Disney animated film.  The colors are vibrant and the widescreen gives the film extra depth.  Add in another great song score including Once Upon a Dream, and you have a true classic.<br /><br />DVD EXTRAS:<br /><br />Disc One - Commentary by Mary Costa (Aurora) and various animators involved in making of the film.<br /><br />Disc Two -<br /><br />Games, Music & Fun:<br /><br />Disney Art Project - Tells you how to build a princess or dragon using ordinary household items like egg cartons and milk cartons<br /><br />Rescue Aurora Adventure Game - A simple but fun game where you are given three answers and a clue.

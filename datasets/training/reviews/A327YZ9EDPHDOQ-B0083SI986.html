<meta name="summary" content="Gran Torino...well worth the ride!"></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood did it again. Another fine effort from the man that has given excitement in many of his movies. This times he tackles life in a neighborhood that has changed with new immigrants.During the movie you find his relationship with his family is rocky and his wife's priest interesting at times. It also features moments that Eastwood is known for...his stand for what is right against being double crossed and for standing up for friends. One of his lines in "Gran Torino" is "I'm not a hero"...to me Eastwood is a hero of good cinema fare! I enjoyed G.T.!</p></body></html>

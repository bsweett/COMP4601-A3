Academy please take note of this virtuoso performance ....this actress is 'old star' quality and deserves more recognition!<br /><br />Don't want to spoil too much .... but it's 'thumbline' being trapped in someone's 'reality' then indulging that person ...then ...looking closely ........<br /><br />Highly recommended - if you liked Polanski's "The Tenant" and especially "Repulsion" - this one's for U.</p></body></html>

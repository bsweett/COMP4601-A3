<meta name="summary" content="Wrong Movie... TO BUY"></head><body><p>I bought this because i thought it was going to be good like texas chainsaw massacre due to the misleading reviews on here. It wasnt. It was nowhere near as good as tcm. The acting SUCKED, the plot predictable and the story has been done before. The only 2 decent actors were Jeremy sisto and the other guy who was going to the interview in the begining. I do not recomend this. I would rent this if you want to see it but definetly do not buy, especially for 25 bucks! Its not even worth the 7 bucks i paid used for it. I shoulda just stuck with the horror classics. I recomend you do the same.</p></body></html>

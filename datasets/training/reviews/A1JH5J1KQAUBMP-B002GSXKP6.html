<meta name="summary" content="Slick and fun"></head><body><p>Danny Ocean (George Clooney), recently paroled from prison, puts together a crew of A-list stars (Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, etc.) in order to pull of a complicated scheme to rip off three Las Vegas casinos simultaneously and take revenge on the slimy casino owner (Andy Garcia) who married his ex-wife (Julia Roberts).  This film features slick direction, mega-watt star power, a well-crafted script by Ted Griffin, and slick direction by Steven Soderbergh.  The result is lots of fun to watch.  There is a clever twist at the end, and the film closes with just the right note of quiet triumph.</p></body></html>

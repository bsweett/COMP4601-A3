<meta name="summary" content="I Personally Enjoyed It"></head><body><p>Reading over a few of the reviews of this film I noticed one major difference between those who enjoyed the movie and those who, well, hated it.  Folks who read the book this film is based on generally seemed to regard this film as an atrocity.  Those people who didn't read the book (such as myself) either really enjoyed the movie or thought it was a mediocre film at best.  I happened to really enjoy the film.  It isn't the greatest fantasy flick to ever grace the silver screen but, then again, most fantasy flicks aren't out to be the greatest.  The bulk of them simply tell a generic story of a "chosen" one who sets out to fulfill their destiny or sacrifice their livelihood for the good of others.  To say that the film is cliche is cliche in and of itself.  Even those films and books considered to be some of the best fantasies involve a singular hero (Frodo Baggins, Luke Skywalker, etc.) who, with a small band of friends, faces off against terrible odds and somehow manages to succeed.  Lesser fantasy films like "Krull," "Willow," "Dragonslayer," and others all reflect the exact same story as do the great ones.<br /><br />"Eragon" falls into this "lesser" fantasy category.  It's a very fun, fast-paced film that tells the story of a young boy who becomes the "last dragonrider."  He's expected to lead the war against the wicked King Galbatorix and his legion of evil.  Along the way he develops friendships with shady characters and honorable fellows.  It's a stock fantasy to say the least, but it's still fun to watch it unfold.<br /><br />I agree with others that say there are plenty of underdeveloped characters.  I also see where many would say that the film is too rushed.  However, with that said, I still found this film to be palatable.  The special effects are well done.  The dragon, Sephira (voiced by Rachel Weisz), is wonderful to look at.  The actors do a fine job with what they're given to work with although some, especially John Malkovich, lack sufficient screentime to really get a grasp on them.  The music fits the fantasy setting very well.  There's nothing that's overly terrible about the movie as a whole in my opinion.<br /><br />So, if you enjoy fantasy films along the same lines as "Krull" and "Willow," "Eragon" should be right up your alley.  If you've read and enjoyed the book, I'm pretty sure you won't enjoy this movie based on the opinion of others reviewing this film.  I had no problem with it and also have no problem with adding this film to my personal collection.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fantasy film fans.  Not recommended to fans of the book this is based on.</p></body></html>

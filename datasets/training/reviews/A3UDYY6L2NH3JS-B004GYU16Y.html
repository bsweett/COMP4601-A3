But it is a good action film and you can enjoy it a lot provided you accept the clich&eacute;s that come with the genre.<br /><br />Of course the first agent shown as the victim of the monstrous communist North Koreans has to be the good one, even if it is a double or triple agent. In the same way the first American agent shown as snow white and crystal clear has to be a traitor and a double agent.<br /><br />So what is the difference of this film as compared to Bourne, Stallone and Terminator?<br /><br />The first element is that there are so many levels of secret agents that ignore one another that the Russians will inevitably lose. They have yet an easy task infiltrating the USA to the top, except the President of course; But this system at one moment has to fail, especially when they start taking hostage the people who are close to their agents and then killing these hostages in cold blood when the effect has been reached, or they think it has. Then the double secret agent has nothing left to lose.<br /><br />Infiltrating the USA is as easy as easy can be because they are a technological sewage or wasteland as for security and screening people and events. Even the procedure to start a nuclear war is so flimsy with confrontation of simple digital signals or alphanumerical codes via machines and nothing else is of course a farce.<br /><br />But good is always the victor in these films. The most positive element is that the main character is a woman, which will satisfy the transfer desires of girls and women in the audience to be able to identify with that demoniac agent impersonated by Angelina Jolie. That's a good change in the genre.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I am a decent deal on blu ray (as I write this).  Take note Blu Ray Execs a blu ray film topped all sales charts (fair price)"></head><body><p>Blu ray prices for new blu ray movies run on avg about 27.95, hd dvd going out of business and having huge sales marked I am Legend upon release to 18.95, so Blu Ray adds some nails to the coffin and does the same.<br />Now the film, I'm some beers deep as I write this and there are some plot holes as said beer wears off, however it is a good time.  This graphic novel for a hollywood movie doesn't go 100% sappy or happy ending on us, it shows pain.  Also cash cow Will Smith isn't such a cliche character.  Speaking on Will Smith he is a good cryer, along the lines of Mel Gibson.  I knew this ever since Fresh Prince when Carlton accidently took pills from Will's locker and needed his stomach pumped, or when his dad didn't show up when he was supposed to, Will Smith crying can get to you, he is a good actor.  Besides being a good actor as I mentioned he is a cash cow every film he is makes around $100 mil, with I am Legend topping $200 mil, Adam Sandler is another safe bet at the box office, although I'm not loving his movies.<br />I expected amazing sound out of this blu ray, however the movie isn't trying to be transformers, it's the end of the world, how loud could it be?  And it isn't, if you saw this in the theaters and had a talker in your midst I feel for you.  The Film does take it's time and let's us feel the movie as opposed to attempting to be a cure for add for the entire time it is on the screen.<br />As for hollywood movies this one is a good time, and a worthy add to a collection, especially at this price when compared to other new releases.  And Amazon has a tendency to up prices here and there so I wouldn't gather it'll stay this way for long.  So I'm going to buy it, and I'll list the dvd features later.<br />Thanks for reading, I am out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nicholson's best acting job.....EVER!!!"></head><body><p>O Me Digas! This film has it all. Right when you think it's safe to laugh, you find yourself sitting on the sofa in complete shock. There are many elements to this film and they are all entwined perfectly.<p>Nicholson plays an eccentric who is forced to stay at a psych ward. It's there that he begins to make his co-nutties feel a little bit better about themselves. He ends up becoming the nemesis of the head nurse, and she counters by making his life a living hell. The end of the film will shock you and make you feel resentment towards the authorities in the hospital. <p>This film has a great message, humor, a high shock value, and Jack Nicholson at his very best. You cannot go wrong with this film, one of my personal all time favorites.</p></body></html>

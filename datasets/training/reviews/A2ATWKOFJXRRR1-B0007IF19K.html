<meta name="summary" content="Great Acting, Okay Film"></head><body><p>"Ray" is a bit tough to review, but only because I absolutely loved Jamie Foxx's performance. Like Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings, and Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, and Marlon Brando as The Godfather, you just can't picture anyone else playing Ray Charles other than Mr. Foxx. His acting was superlative, his knowledge of the material (Ray Charles himself), mind-boggling. It was worth the price of admission just to see how much he "owned" this role.<br /><br />But one great actor does not a great movie make. I will give credit to the filming, cinematography, and the other minor characters in the film. The problem I had, though, was that I felt the psychological impact of Ray's childhood was forced upon me as the viewer. I felt like the screenwriters were saying, "Okay, here we need to have the audience in tears", and "Here we need them to have empathy with Ray for his horrible childhood". Because of this, the emotional impact on me was negligible.<br /><br />I will say that I did learn a thing or two about Mr. Charles' life. For instance, I had no idea that he had such a horrible heroin addiction for so long. I remember reading about some of this in the papers years ago but I wasn't aware that it had started so early in his musical career, and how much it affected his life and music much later on.<br /><br />And here's an interesting thing to me: I actually BOUGHT this film on DVD. Even with the flaws in the script, I just couldn't take my eyes off of Jamie Foxx's portrayal whenever he came on screen. He deserves the Best Actor award at the Oscars, and I'll bet dollars to donuts that he gets it, too.</p></body></html>

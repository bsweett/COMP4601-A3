<meta name="summary" content=""The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed. It's you, David.""></head><body><p>The copy of this 1990 VIDEO TREASURES VHS that I received in Feb. 2010 has a cover photo of the two young Americans' nightime wandering of the moors in Wales. Recorded in LP speed, picture sharpness suffers slightly but is still acceptable. A linear mono audio track, not HiFi, is strong and clear. Of greatest importance:  this particular "used" tape tracks flawlessly.<br /><br />In AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON (1981), writer/director John Landis respectfully tips his hat to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001TZ6Q">Lon Chaney Jr. lycanthropic classic of 40 years earlier</a>, then deftly surpasses that picture both stylistically and cinematically. In special effects alone, this one is worlds beyond the clumsy film overlaps used to transform Chaney from an upright man to an upright hirsute. Under a full moon, Landis's misfortunate bite victim moans, screams, thrashes, emits guttural sounds and writhes in naked terror as hands and feet elongate into paws, face stretches to a snout, body hair thickens to sparse fur and the newly-born creature loses all bipedal abilities.<br /><br />We witness this chillingly detailed metamorphosis one time only, and that's more than adequate. Often the stalking monster is represented by a camera looking out  from its viewpoint; also effective as we close in on fleeing prey. There's gore, but it's not gratuitous and is used only when necessary. A new element is that those killed by a werewolf are doomed to wander Earth as undeads until the last of the creatures either commits suicide or is destroyed, which is best accomplished by someone who loves the man underneath the wolf.<br /><br />Simply put: despite a recent CGI-laden version, this well-done, by turns dramatic, humorous and frightening work just may be the werewolf to see. Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

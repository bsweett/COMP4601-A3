The movie begins in the mountains and deserts of Afghanistan, as a group of Army Hummers are transporting businessman Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) through the war zone. All of a sudden, explosions begin and shots are fired at the Hummers. US Soldiers are shot and killed.  Stark jumps out of the Hummer and starts running. As an idiot could guess, he doesn't get far before he gets shot and captured.<br /><br />Rewind 36 hours to an award ceremony at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, where Tony Stark is about to get an award for his achievements in the weapons' producing industry. His father began Stark Industries some time ago and Tony took over when Daddy died. Tony was a 6-year old product developer so, at probably 40-something, he is quite proficient now. He remains single and enjoys a romp with the ladies, now and then.  While the award is being handed out, Tony is gambling in Vegas and smoozing the women.  His military liaison (Terrence Howard) comes looking for him in the casino to remind him that he promised to be there for the award, so, you can see the carefree attitude of a stuck-on-himself, filty-rich genius.  Gwyneth Paltrow is his administrative assistant who takes care of everything for him. Stark has an awesome car, his own plane, and a computer system that would probably make Bill Gates drool, complete with holographic imaging. (You will likely recognize Terrance Howard when you see him.)<br /><br />Fast forward back to Afghanistan.  Stark was there to conduct a weapons missle presentation for the US army. Stark was seriously injured. He is hauled off to a terrorist camp.  As he looks around, he notices the camp is loaded with Stark weapons. He begins to realize that his lifetime labors of love have also been going to the "bad" guys to help them kill Americans.  The terrorists order Stark to build his new missile for them and they will set him free. He knows its a lie but it buys him time to appear to work on the missle. Instead he builds a very special iron man suit.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges, with a shaved head, plays an interesting role. I believe he is chairman of the board at Stark Industries, or something similar.  This is a super good action film. Great job by all the actors. Good guys vs. bad guys theme. The computer graphic imaging was great, too. Approximately 2 hrs. Not for young children. (Some people get shot in Afghanistan, and although these scenes were not belabored, I doubt that you want your young impressionable children to carry these images around in their heads.)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What Hurt THE HURT LOCKER"></head><body><p>I really wanted to like this movie. And I did.  The performances were strong, the direction was decent, the script had some kinks but overall it worked for me.<br /><br />Now there will be a lot of Vets who will destroy this movie over technical stuff or just unbelievable plot turns.  I could even add my own: you don't key a radio next to a bomb.  Never.  When the bomb tech holds his radio up to the unfortunate Iraqi forced to wear a suicide vest, I cringed.  You don't do that.  No cell phones or radios.  Ever.  "You're 10-2."  Ka Boom.<br /><br />But it wasn't enough to ruin the movie for me.  And any movie that tries to show what our soldiers are going through is always a good thing (unless, of course, it's JARHEAD, which I didn't see but read the blistering review in the New York Post by a furious Iraqi Veteran).<br /><br />It takes a while but the characters start to emerge and you like the three guys the film focuses on.  Especially the "wild man" who discovers the one thing in life he loves.  Excellent actors like Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce make appearances.  And some sequences are very well edited for maximum suspense.<br /><br />Another thing that hurt this film: Hollywood politics.  Kathryn Bigelow, the director, beat her ex-husband James Cameron (AVATAR) for Best Director. I knew that was going to happen.  In a business where powerful men (like Cameron) who dump wives for younger women (like Cameron) deserve to have their comeuppance, Hollywood-style.  That dynamic, I believe, diminishes Bigelow's win.  Sadly.  Yes, it was about time a woman was honored for Best Director, but Hollywood's zeal for drama and their taste for revenge sullied her win.  It will always be there.<br />I'm not saying she didn't deserve it...I just wish it had been under different circumstances.<br /><br />So I liked the cast, loved some sequences.  I will appreciate any film where our boys are heroes.  So check it out.</p></body></html>

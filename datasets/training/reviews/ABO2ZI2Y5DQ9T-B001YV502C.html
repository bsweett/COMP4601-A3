<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) Great Visual Techniques and Very Intense Battles"></head><body><p>Based on P. D. James' novel of the same title, Alfonso Cuaron made a futuristic action/thriller, which opens with a strange news report about a shocking death of 'the world's youngest man.' The film is set in England, now chaotic country in the year of 2027. No child has been born for 18 years in the world and the country witnessed the widening gap between those who have and those who do not. Humans are going to be extinct very slowly.<br /><br />[STORY] Clive Own plays a quiet businessman Theodore, a former activist whose ex-lover (and now the leader of anti-government group called FISH) Julian (Julianne Moore) suddenly shows up before him and asks him to do an impossible thing for her. She says her organization needs a government's pass to secretly transport a woman named Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) out of England, who is, she believes, the only hope to save the world from destruction.<br /><br />[ACTORS] Though Julianne Moore is second-billed, and her character plays an important role in the story, hers is actually an extended cameo. Michael Caine effectively plays an ex-hippie Jasper (with a long hair which might look a bit strange) who gives a help to Theo, and there are supporting actors like Chiwetel Ejiofor, Charlie Hunnam, Danny Huston and Peter Mullan, but the film basically belongs to two actors Clive Owen and Claire-Hope Ashitey.<br /><br />[VISUALLY STUNNING] You should not miss two long continuous shots, one of which goes on more than 10 minutes. Besides these technical things, Alfonso Cuaron, with Emmanuel Lubezki very realistic photography, succeeds in creating a bleak view of the world that reminds us of recent news footages from Iraq. The director refuses to use his trademark green color here. Instead he uses grey-colored images that captures the brooding atmosphere of the future with no hope. And don't forget this; the film is sometimes violent, showing spluttered blood on the lense.<br /><br />Clive Owen is very good as reluctant hero and so are other actors, whose acting almost makes up for the film's flawed script. Though I have not read the original book, Alfonso Cuaron clearly changed it to make the film's theme more immediate. That is fine, but still the plot suffers from some incredible coincidences (which I cannot reveal here) and some gaps in logics. To me Cuaron's vision about the strife-torn land of England, where refugees are treated in the places that look like concentration camps, are convincing only visually -- why do people rush to England when Theo and Kee must leave? Is there a better place outside there? These and other details remain hazy.<br /><br />Though the film is set in the near future, it is clearly about our time. The film is visually stunning, especially during the battles (don't miss the driving scene) and you also get the original music by John Tavener, but the more detailed logics in plot would have made it a better film. Still the film's intense and impressive images cannot be easily forgotten.</p></body></html>

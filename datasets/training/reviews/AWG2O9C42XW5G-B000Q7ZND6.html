Keeauna reeves does a pretty good job at his character. i saw the wide screen version and it sucked because it took half the picture away. if you want to see the real deal watch full screen if you can. You gotta see this film.<br /><br />Plot. John Constatine(Keeauna reeves) can see demons. The demons plan to take over the world by thier fowller The Devil's son, And John Constatine bounds to do something about it. John Teams Up with this hot Cop. And they try to put an end to the Devil's sons reign.<br /><br />If You Liked the movie Read The Book & Listen To The Soundtrack</p></body></html>

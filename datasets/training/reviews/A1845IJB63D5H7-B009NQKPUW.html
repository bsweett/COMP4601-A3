<meta name="summary" content="Impressive animation and art, meager plot"></head><body><p>The contrast between the very advanced animation art and the mediocre planning of the crew, in Prometheus, is an afterthought. The story for searching for the creator was compelling in the sense that the Earth explorers, via comparative studies of various Earth's civilizations were hinted that a specific planet in a nearby star-system might host the original creators of our Earth species. Up to this point, everything looks very realistic.<br /><br />Skip the funding alibis; get to the machine that will voyage to the remote planet and its crew. The spaceship was truly impressively depicted. With onsite surgical robot in case of medical emergency, plenty of dream automated technologies that captured the imagination and render the movie enjoyable.<br /><br />Things get annoying when the exploring crew move into the mysterious structure on the remote planet and start violating the protocol of exploration. Even a dialogue between a smoker explorer and a nonsmoker shows the improper embarking on incompetent people for such extremely complicated mission. All exposed individuals got infected with mysterious parasites or DNA altering agents.<br /><br />With few crew members, taking the risk of making stupid mistakes and ending up being exterminated, in order to spare the remaining crew the risk of spread of infection, rendered the science fiction less challenging. There was compelling sequence of events that certain human activities were in process in the parked spaceship on such remote planet. Such compelling logic could have be farther enhanced to advance a more intriguing conclusion than spoiling the scenario with some foolish errors by scientists uncaring about the basics of their craft.<br /><br />In comparison to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083SBJXS">Marvel's The Avengers</a>, which I enjoyed watching few times, Prometheus is not that kind of movie that would attract me to see it more than once. The few memorable scenes were silent, gray, and not very engaging.<br /><br />One would question the rationale of inserting into the movie a robot of the exact likeness of man, then let that robot conspire to transmit DNA stolen from the site of exploration into the drink of the principle investigator of the expedition crew, which led to the death of the crew member and the impregnation of his mate with alien fetus. In fact, David the robot was entirely a misfit. Likewise, the ship captain performed as if he was a cap driver, with very limited intellectual feel of his role in scientific expedition. It is truly fortunate that the moveimakers are not entrusted with selecting scientific crews of such eminent tasks.<br /><br />Mohamed F. El-Hewie</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I found this eco-horror flick to be much better than they said -- not a conventional Hollywood thriller, much closer to J-horror"></head><body><p>If you go into "The Happening" expecting an American style horror/disaster flick, you're bound to be disappointed.  What you want from that kind of film are massive explosions, car crashes, tornadoes, zombies or monsters or ghosts, and big budget special effects, all tied together into some kind of coherent narrative with escalating action, leading to a climax in which (usually) the hero saves the world (or at least the local community) and achieves some kind of much needed reconciliation with his/her family.<br /><br />While there are elements of all that in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DZOC6Y">The Happening</a>, what you really get here is something else, more subtle and strange, that alternates between the utterly mundane and the overblown melodramatic, between everyday moments and terrifying extremes.  There isn't really a sense of escalating action, but more inaction punctuated with crisis situations.  For the most part the feeling is sustained by a subtly creepy intensity mixed with moments of somewhat silly, interrupted by a few sudden and inexplicable and gory moments, inventive acts of self-destruction, all designed to shock and amuse.  If you go into this expecting something else, the style here can look like incompetence.  What struck me watching it the first time in theaters and even more on subsequent viewings in the home is that this is much more like a Japanese than American style horror film.  M. Night Shyamalan effectively made a "J-horror" flick.  Many of the very same features that some were bugged by in this film appear in spades in "J-Horror" films and are accepted as cultural oddities - I think there is a greater tolerance for unconventional stylings when they appear in a foreign language.  I suspect that if this had been an Asian film with subtitles, but otherwise identical, many critics who panned it would have proclaimed it brilliantly ironic and inventive.<br /><br />In J-horror (such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000088NQR">Ringu</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009KA2UO">Dark Water</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CC885">Suicide Club</a>, or, even better, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E0OE4O">Pulse</a>) the focus tends to be on ordinary people, caught up in an inexplicable and seemingly supernatural situation, usually where some kind of force is out to avenge itself for some offence and doesn't really care who suffers, only cares that they suffer.  Part of what generates dread in these films is that the audience is aware of a real and potent threat, that the protagonists only gradually come to accept as real.  Moreover, it quickly becomes apparent there is no escape, and the threat is uncaring and implacable.  These films usually aren't plotted in the so-called "Hollywood style," where a character must act to face up to an escalating challenge that is both broadly significant and deeply personal.  In J-horror, the ultimate outcome is just not up to the characters.  They can't rise to the challenge, and the escalating dread comes from the fact that their efforts eventually come to nothing.  If they end up escaping, that is as inexplicable as the initial danger; while they may resolve personal issues, the larger issue represented by the threat remains unresolved.  While the story itself often meanders and reactions often alternate between overblown and understated, what ties it together are a series of horrific images, that are not so much explicit as highly suggestive.  Anyone who's seen "The Happening" should recognize that it fits easily with this general pattern - Frank Darabont's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010X745K">The Mist</a> works along similar lines, but is closer to conventional horror film expectations.<br /><br />Where the film deviates from the general framework is in its fairly unambiguous (pseudoscientific) explanations of the ultimate grounds of the inexplicable happenings.  Still, if it is blunt in its environmental message, it is also bluntly ironic about the likelihood of any changes taking place as a result of the kind of massive ecological catastrophe depicted here.  I found it to be a lot of fun to watch, and when I saw it again with my wife, we were both entertained.  My sense is that much of the disappointment about Shyamalan comes from expecting him to make the usual kind of Hollywood blockbuster films, when what he really does best is something more akin to American independent and foreign horror films.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A fantastic and truly terrifying horror film."></head><body><p>When it comes to scary movies, monsters don't do it for me.  Vampires, werewolves, alien beings--they are all entertaining, but not scary.  People terrify me; human fraility scares the crap out of me.  Which is why "The Mist" has long been one of my favorite King novellas: sure, it's a monster tale, but the REAL monsters in the story aren't the ones out in the mist--they're the ones inside the store.  In some cases they are obvious; in others, not.<br /><br />When I first saw "The Mist," I thought it was a good B-movie, with a classic ending (truly one of the best in horror cinema).  I was disturbed more so than usual, but not absolutely floored.  But I thought about it.  And thought about it.  It's been almost a year since I first saw it; I recently watched it a second time (in black and white this time, btw).  And I was terrified.  The special effects are pretty good, though at times they get in the way of the actors.  Let me stress that--the actors, here, are the true stars, not the special effects.  Thomas Jane is phenomenal; Marcia Gay Harden is chilling.  Frank Darabont does a brilliant job of bringing King's tale to the screen (even King himself has stated he wished he'd thought of this ending).<br /><br />The story, for what it's worth, centers around a group of people trapped inside a convenience store.  Outside the plate-glass windows is...the mist.  The mist and the deadly, flesh-eating creatures that lurk in it.  The real story of the movie, the real meat (and the real scary stuff), is what happens to the people trapped inside the store--how they cope with it, to who and what they turn to for comfort.  This is a film that tackles the topic of what would happen when ordinary citizens encounter something truly alien--not something we're halfway familiar with, but something completely outside our capabilities for rationalization.  What WOULD happen if strange beings appeared from practically nowhere and began eating your loved ones?  How would that affect the human psyche?<br /><br />That's what King's tale tried to explain; Darabont's film follows suit.  It is a haunting, subtle film that will stay with you long after it's over, thanks in part to (what I consider to be, at least) one of the greatest horror movie endings ever.  You should also, if given the chance (which thank God you are, on the two-disc edition), watch the film in black & white.  The effects come off as a little cheesier...but that's half the fun.  Because, with a film this dark and disturbing, we'll take the fun wherever we can find it.</p></body></html>

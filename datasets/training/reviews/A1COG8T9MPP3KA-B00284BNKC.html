<meta name="summary" content="Good film ruined by trendiness"></head><body><p>The film was pretty good. A true depiction of addiction. Pretty edgy at times. The thing is, with the MTV style cinematography, this film will not date well. I am referring to the &quot;self cam&quot; that proceeds the characters as they walk around. The type of cam used for shows such as MTV's &quot;Fear&quot;, where you can view the expressions of the participant as they walk around. In 15 or 20 years this will be atrocious. It ruined the chances of this film becoming a classic.</p></body></html>

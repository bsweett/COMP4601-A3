<meta name="summary" content="The Matrix Reloads"></head><body><p>The Washowski bothers complex sequal to the 1999 masterpeice Sci Fi mindbender The Matrix , The Matrix Reloaded may not be a<br />perfect sequal, but it is impressive in the upgrades it has to<br />offer the entire cast is back Keanu Reeves , Cary Ann Moss ,Hugo<br />Weaving , Lawrence Fishburne.But this sequal is bigger faster<br />and much more complex then the first one , and for those who do<br />not like for those unfortunate people The Matrix Revolutions<br />will still be just as complex as it's sequal and The Matrix it<br />is the way these directors wan't it they don't wan't you to be<br />able to figure these films out in the first 10 minutes and at<br />times this is what hollywood is lacking the brain teasers of<br />old.<p>  Neo(Keanu Reeves) now copeing with his newfound power as The<br />One some people beleive in him , others do not and question what<br />his motives are , But Morpheus still beleives in him even more<br />now and so does his girlfriend and resistance warrior Trinity<br />(Cary Ann Moss).Neo,Morpheus and Trinity all head to the last remaning city that has remained untouched since The Matrix was<br />put online.Emotions run frequent and word of the machines are<br />amassing a huge army to invade Zion , these machines will do<br />this any way and every way to destroy it including the return of<br />Neo's arch nemisis Agent Smith who has some how found a way to<br />bend the rules of The Matrix as well but Agent Smith has become<br />much more then that he has found a way to enter the real world<br />by way of taking over a host , the many brutal battles that Neo<br />must face give him more unrest of weither he is right to be the<br />one,but when Zion is under invasion he must find a way to get to<br />the programmer of The Matrix at all costs even if Agent Smith is<br />at his every move and able to multiply himself at will.When he<br />gets to the programmer he tells Neo in a very complex way either<br />save the life of his lover Trinity or save the future existance of humanity in this complex sequel in one of the most complex<br />film trilogys hollywood has ever made.And has a cliffhanger that<br />will sure to please fans when the third and final film comes out.<p>  Several documetarys and a 30 minute documentary about the<br />explosive mind bending highway chase scene that took 12 minutes<br />in the movie and basically revolutionized the way car chases<br />are done, Trailers and drawings but no commentary here , all<br />said and done this may not be better then the matrix but it<br />passes in spades as a sequal and teaser for The Matrix Revolutions wich will be in theatres in the first week of november it's a worth addition and companion peice to the matrix.</p></body></html>

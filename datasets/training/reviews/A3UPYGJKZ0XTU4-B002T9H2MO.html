Sometime in the near future, Earth relies on Helium-3 fusion for much of its energy supply. The He-3 is collected by Lunar Industries from a mining base on the dark side of the moon. The Sarang Mining Base has a human staff of one, who is responsible for maintenance of the harvesters. That man is Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell). He is assisted by a creepily polite robot named GERTY (voice of Kevin Spacey). Sam's 3-year contract will be up in 2 weeks, and he can't wait to get back to his family on Earth. But Sam starts seeing things. He has an accident while tending to one of the harvesters. It begins to look like things at Sarang may not be what they seem.<br /><br />GERTY is reminiscent of HAL of "2001" fame. "Moon" isn't coy about alluding to other films, but the allusions are more often used to create an expectation in the viewer that will later be challenged than to simply imitate. "Moon" goes in a different direction. It was made on an impressive $5 million dollars, shot in only 33 days, and spent a year in post-production. A tiny budget for sci-fi, but it looks like a lot more. There are 400 effects shots, but most of the moon scenes are done with miniatures. Miniature models always look better than CGI, especially since they can now be cleaned up digitally. Sam Rockwell deserves praise for being able to carry the film with no one to talk to but himself. "Moon" has some lose ends that don't add up, but that doesn't distract from the unique environment and suspense that make it so appealing.<br /><br />The DVD (Sony 2010): Bonus features include a short film, 4 featurettes, 2 commentaries, and a theatrical trailer (2 min). "Whistle" (26 min) is a short film by Duncan Jones about an assassin who carries out his plans long-distance from his home with his family in the Alps. "The Making of Moon" (16 min) interviews Duncan Jones about sets, genesis of the film and Sam Rockwell about playing two roles. In "Creating the Visual Effects" (11 min), effects supervisor Simon Stanley-Clamp tells us how the clones, GERTY, lunarscapes, and lighting were achieved. "Science Center Q&A"* (20 min) was a Q&A session at NASA in Houston, where Duncan Jones takes questions. The NASA folk asked interesting questions but not technical. "Filmmaker's Q&A at Sundance" (11 min) was after the screening there.<br /><br />There are two feature commentaries. The commentary by director/storywriter Duncan Jones and producer Stuart Fenegan is the more informative and technical. They talk about why they made the choices they did, sets, which shots are on set vs miniatures or CGI, set details and technologies, the story and the Sams. The other feature commentary is with Duncan Jones, Director of Photography Gary Shaw, Concept Designer Gavin Rothery, and Production Designer Tony Noble. It is not very informative, as the participants are talking to each other rather than explaining anything to the audience. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and French, and English for the commentaries. Dubbing available for the film in French.</p></body></html>

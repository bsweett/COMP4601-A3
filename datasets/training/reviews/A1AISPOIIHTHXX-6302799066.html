<meta name="summary" content="Probably one of the few Kubricks I like"></head><body><p>It's funny, I've seen 3 previous Kubrick movies before this: A Clockwork Orange, the Shining and 2001. Only the Shining I liked as Clockwork seemed kind of boring and 2001 seemed really slow at times. Dr Strangelove is one of the few that I like and although I didn't find it a laugh riot all the way through, its satire and funny dialogue was perfect, and the performances were great as well.<br /><br />An Air Force commander goes nuts and convinces a fleet of planes that Russia is planning an attack so he calls for an action to nuke them. The film switches between 3 locales mainly: the War Room with the President and other government officials, the crazy commander and a soldier trying to get him to stop and inside the plane, on their way to bombing Russia.<br /><br />The performances are quite excellent with George C. Scott playing quite an animated Officer while Peter Sellers plays no less than 3 roles: the President, Mandrake, the officer trying to stop the rogue commander and Dr Strangelove, an ex-Nazi scientist in a wheelchair. Then of course there's Slim Pickens who replaced what was supposed to be Peter Sellers' 4th character as Major Kong. Also look for James Earl Jones, later being of course the voice of Darth Vader.<br /><br />One of the most well-known images of the film is Major King yahooing on the nuclear bomb all the way down to annihilation. Whether this was the first time that a big vertical tracking shot was shown but it sure seems familiar now. Pearl Harbor's infamous shot, the boulder in Return of the King and even the end to Temple of Doom had similar shots so either this was the start or it was another homage but it's certainly a famous shot.<br /><br />It's best if you go with the Anniversary Edition since the image is more cleaner. I watched the SE and there was print flaws all over the place. There's a couple new features which probably doesn't seem like much but for the best looking, get the Anniversary edition.<br /><br />It's certainly a funny movie and a well-made one and Kubrick, who is usually known for precision and coldness rather than emotional films, it's nice to see one that I actually like.</p></body></html>

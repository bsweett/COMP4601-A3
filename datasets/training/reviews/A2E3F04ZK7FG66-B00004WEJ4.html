Even though it was made as an obvious war-time morale booster at a time when America needed it, and these kinds of films were the most commonplace and most wanted kind of entertainment, this particular one turned out to be something very special. Bogart starred in several of these kinds of films, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIXLVQ">Humphrey Bogart - The Signature Collection, Vol. 2 (The Maltese Falcon Three-Disc Special Edition / Across the Pacific / Action in the North Atlantic / All Through the Night / Passage to Marseille)</a> is full of them, yet I enjoy these films over and over. They are not just some dated WWII epics as so many films of that era come across today. So part of the attraction just has to be Bogart himself, the knowledge that nobody is that tough - yet Bogart pulls it off, and at the same time you can believe him capable of feeling the most intense romantic love possible. Or he can just use women and cast them aside - Bogie always keeps you guessing. Also, Casablanca is just about the most romantic film ever made. Finally, there are those wonderful supporting players - Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, and the scene-stealing Claude Rains who claims to be shocked that there is gambling going on at Rick's Cafe Americain as he pockets his winnings.<br /><br />If you don't already own Casablanca, I feel it's an essential classic movie purchase, even if you're not really a classic movie fan. However, the only thing changing here versus the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W0WM">Casablanca (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> is the artwork and the documentary on Jack Warner. My personal opinion is that, for the value, that is the better buy. Thus I arrived at my rating as follows:<br /><br />The film = 5 stars<br />The value of this edition = 3 stars<br />This averages to four stars.<br /><br />Warner Home Video has slowed down its release of classic films new to DVD this year and retreated to the safer territory of reissuing some of its sure-sellers. I hope that this is just a temporary decision based on the bad economy and not the beginning of a trend.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="De Niro and Pacino shine!"></head><body><p>This is arguably one of my favorite action flicks. With a cast to die for, and a director who just keeps turning out fabulous films, Heat has it all for some serious testosterone. Al Pacino plays a world weary LA detective who takes down sophisticated robbers. He is pitted against the a-team of thieves led by Robert De Niro as an incredible group of actors-criminals including, Val Kilmer and Michael Masden and an all star cast of crooks looking for that big score. The sub plots are well developed, and the suspense is fabulous, as Pacino and De Niro establish a mutual respect that leads to a fantastic creshendo of conflict and action. I can't say a bad thing about this flick.</p></body></html>

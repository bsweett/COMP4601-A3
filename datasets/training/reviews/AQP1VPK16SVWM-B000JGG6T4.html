Creasy finds work guarding nine-year-old Pita (Dakota Fanning) of  rich Mexican industrialist Samuel (Marc Anthony) and his American-born wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell) at the recommendation of one of his old collegues (Christopher Walken). With so many family members "disappeared" south of the border and a major deal pending to manufacture cars, there's concern that Pita might be a target of kidnappers. Creasy expresses no interest in bonding with the girl because it reminds him to much of an incident from his past but Pita breaks through Creasy's hardened exterior reminding him of his humanity.  When Pita is taken, the wounded Creasy makes it his business to find her before she's killed.<br /><br />This is the second time "Man on Fire" has been adapted for the big screen. The first adaptation in 1987 featuring Scott Glenn, Jonathan Pryce, Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams and Jade Malle and directed by Elie Chouraqui disappeared without a trace when it was released. Since Tony Scott was originally on tap to direct the 1987 version, he looked to the past when looking for his next project after the well received "Spy Game". With Marlon Brando completely out of the picture for the role (he was considered for Scott's planned version in 1987), Bruce Willis, Will Smith and Robert De Niro all taking passes on the role, Denzel Washington stepped into the role after a chance meeting with director Scott. Washington plays the role to perfection. His Creasy although a burned out husk of a man, has just enough spark of humanity left so that he can be touched by Pita. Fanning once again gives an incandescent performance and the other members of the supporting cast including Radha Mitchell ("Pitch Black"), singer Marc Anthony, Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke all give marvelously detailed performances. Although Scott becomes a bit obsessed with technique over story once the abduction occurs, his showy directorial style doesn't overwhelm the strong emotional material at the core of the story. Although it runs about 20 minutes too long, "Man on Fire" is a perfect action thriller and compliments Scott's best work ("Crimson Tide", "The Hunger", "True Romance") avoiding the cliches of his hack work ("Beverly Hills Cop II", "Top Gun", "The Last Boy Scout").<br /><br /> Another top notch transfer from Fox, "Man on Fire" looks very good on DVD with most of its disc space devoted to the feature itself. The grainy look of the film, unusual textures and the muted colors that represent Creasy's emotional state are all captured remarkably well. The explosive 5.1 sound mix also grabs your attention. Scott and his sound mixer do a stellar job at reproducing the atmosphere of Mexico City in the detailed surround mix. There's a considerable amount of texture and detail that's well reproduced for the DVD.<br /><br />When it comes to extras "Man on Fire" runs cold. We only get a Fox advertisement "Inside Look" that gives us a glimpse at the trailer for the forthcoming thriller "Hide and Seek" and a brief behind-the-scenes promo for "Taxi".<br /><br />We get two wonderful commentary tracks. The first features director Tony Scott solo discussing what attracted him to the story in the first place both in 1986 and in 2002 when he chose to direct screenwriter Brian Helgeland's ("Mystic River", "L.A. Confidential", "The Order" and "A Knight's Tale"). Writer Helgeland, producer Foster ("Walking Tall", "Crimson Tide") and actress Fanning all vie for your attention on a second audio commentary track. All three discuss Scott's edgy direction, the performances and the changes the script when through from inception to production. Surprisingly, Fanning more than holds her own with these two seasoned veterans. Hearing these three discuss Scott's approach to the film and their candid assessment of what works and doesn't is also a highlight.<br /><br /> A taunt, well directed thriller "Man on Fire" provides Denzel Washington to investigate the haunted world of Creasy. Filled with a number of marvelous performances, edgy direction and a well written script, "Man on Fire" received an undeserved critical drubbing by many critics (probably because of Scott's association with the project). Seeing it on home video makes the over-the-top production and visual style less of an issue because the emotional aspect of the film becomes more powerful.</p></body></html>

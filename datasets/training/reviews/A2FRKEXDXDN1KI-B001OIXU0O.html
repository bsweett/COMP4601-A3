The Movie", the film adaptation from the jukebox musical by British playwright Catherine Johnson and featuring the songs of ABBA, composed by Benny Anderson and Bjorn Ulvaeus (both the male members of the group).  In 1999, the musical has brought in over $2.0 billion in earnings (becoming the highest grossing musical of all time)and what better than to have a film adaptation a decade later.<br /><br />With Tom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson producing the film, "Mamma Mia! The Movie" would be directed by British director Phyllida Lloyd and a screenplay by Catherine Johnson.  The film adaptation would feature an all-star cast starring Meryl Streep ("Kramer vs. Kramer", "Adaptation", "The Devil Wears Prada"), Pierce Brosnan (James Bond 007 films, "The Thomas Crown Affair"), Colin Firth ("The English Patient", "Pride and Prejudice", "Shakespeare in Love"), Stellan Skarsgard ("Pirates of the Carribean: At World's End", "Beowulf and Grendel", "Dogville), Julie Walters (Harry Potter films, "Becoming Jane", "Billy Elliot) and Christine Baranski ("Happy Family", "How the Grinch Stole Christmas", "Chicago") and a film that would jumpstart the careers of Amanda Seyfried ("Mean Girls", "Veronica Mars") and Dominic Cooper ("The Duchess").<br /><br />The film which cost $52 million would earn over $609 million worldwide in the box office making the film one of the top 50 highest grossing films of all time and the distinction of the highest grossing movie musical in the world.<br /><br />"Mamma Mia!

The Movie" is presented in 1080p High-Definition (Widescreen 2:40:1).  "Mama Mia! The Movie" is quite interesting presentation.  For one, the film is shot in Greece and the scenery is absolutely breathtaking.  But there is also an artistic element that cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos brought to the film (Director Phyllida Lloyd goes more into wanting a dramatical effect for the film through experimental shooting during day and night).  From scenes overlooking the ocean at night with the beautiful black and blues, to the shots of the wedding as lights are seen going up to the church area.  Absolute beautiful!<br /><br />But it's also important to note that Zambarloukos went with colors that are high in contrast at times and colors that may seem a bit oversaturated  at times but for the most part, it added to the vibrancy of the film  and looks incredible on Blu-ray.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />"Mamma Mia! The Movie" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio and Spanish and French Dolby Digital 5.1.  Dialogue is clear and understandable and comes clear from the front and center channels but the film is obviously going to be musically driven and one is not going to hear an aggressive soundtrack.  Music sounds good but not great as the lossless soundtrack is not as immersive as I would have wanted it to be.  I didn't notice the surround or rear channels being utilized throughout the film.  So, it would have been great if the mix would have incorporated those channels.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"Mamma Mia!

The Movie" since "Grease".  I absolutely felt that Amanda Seyfried shined throughout this film.  Seyfried is absolutely radiant in this fim and since the theatrical release of "Mamma Mia! The Movie", I have been quite impressed by her work.  She's an amazing actress with so much depth and she shows what she is capable of in "Mamma Mia!", definitely far from what we have seen of her in "Mean Girls" and "Veronica Mars".<br /><br />And Meryl Streep, what a brilliant performance.  It's one thing for Streep to be known as a wonderful award winning actress but somehow there was this synergy that went through the cast and but especially for Meryl Streep, she was electrifying and had so much energy, I was impressed.<br /><br />The cast was absolutely fun to watch and although some of the talent (specifically the male talent) are not known for singing, I suppose the film brought this naturalness to its characters.<br /><br />But it all comes down to the music of ABBA, especially if you enjoyed their music in the past.  For me, it was nostalgic as I grew up during the '70s and my parents were part of those disco years and part of my younger life was at home with plenty of people taking part in these disco parties.  So, the music of ABBA didn't bother me and in some ways, some songs really got me interested in how the original music sounds compared to the movie musical and songs such as "Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!" surprised me because I thought the music was first created for Madonna's 2005 song "Hung Up".<br /><br />But there is so many things that came together for this film that I absolutely enjoyed.  The location was absolutely beautiful, the editing that helped enhance the musical numbers were well-done and as mentioned, the talents were just enjoyable to watch.  This was an enjoyable film that didn't require any seriousness or surrealistic plot, this was a straight-forward fun, vibrant film with an enjoyable cast.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray, there are people who enjoy musicals and I know the music of ABBA and disco may be a bit much for some people expecting something along a similar path of movie musicals such as "Moulin Rouge", "Chicago" or "Nine" but "Mamma Mia! The Movie" is a film about having fun and being in love, and I suppose once can say that ABBA's music embodies that.  This is a gorgeous movie on Blu-ray and some may feel the film was too oversaturated for their taste but I felt that there was a sense of artistry in terms of cinematography.<br /><br />Overall, "Mamma Mia! The Movie" is a wonderful musical on Blu-ray and if you are into musicals, especially the music of ABBA and want something more lively and fun, definitely give this Blu-ray release a try!

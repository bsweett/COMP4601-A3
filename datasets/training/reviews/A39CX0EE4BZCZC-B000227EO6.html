<meta name="summary" content="Love The Dialogue & Blu-Ray Sharpness"></head><body><p>This is unique, a film unlike any I've seen before. It features either calm discussions (most of the film) or intense, insane action. Most of the film, surprisingly, is talk...and I found the conversations fascinating.  This movie also looks fantastic on Blu-Ray......a real treat for the eyes.<br /><br />After the ultra-violent Kill Bill Vol. 1, this movie was shock. There is no shouting in here, no yelling, just a few very sick killers with good vocabularies talking to one another. It sounds boring, but it wasn't to me. Even the trailer-trash lowlife played by Michael Madsen, had a good way with the words.<br /><br />The violence in here is not that prevalent, and it's not the brain- numbing kind that made up most of the Vol. 1 in this two-part story.<br /><br />Yeah, I liked this stylish film. It's good storytelling, and it's definitely one to get on Blu-Ray.</p></body></html>

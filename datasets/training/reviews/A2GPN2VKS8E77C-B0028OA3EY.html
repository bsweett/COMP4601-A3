<meta name="summary" content="The Man Of Steel Is Back...With A Vengeance."></head><body><p>After 20 years, The Man Of Steel is back...with a new face. From the director & writer of "The Usual Suspects" (an engrossing suspense thriller with a wicked twist of an ending) comes the "Sequel" to<br />"Superman II." Disregarding the abysmal "Superman III" & "Superman IV" (despite a terrific performance from Christopher Reeve; stupid script & horrible direction), this film is a sequel & homage to the films made in 1978 & 1980. Brandon Routh makes an interesting Clark Kent/Superman, but he fell flat when he said the lines spoken by Christopher Reeve in the original. I enjoyed the subplot with Lois Lane and her son. Really good. I'm looking forward to the sequel. Rated PG for action violence.</p></body></html>

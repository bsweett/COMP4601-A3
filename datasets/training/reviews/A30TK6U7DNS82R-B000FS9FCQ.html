<meta name="summary" content="A Film Heavy with Paradox"></head><body><p>We saw this movie on the IMAX screen here in San Francisco and it was fairly overpowering.  At the end of the movie we just sat there in our chairs while the Rolling Stones' "Street Fighting Man" blared out of the 108+ speakers hidden behind the screen, too drained to say anything but eager to agree.<br /><br />Natalie Portman is OK, her disturbing and irrelevant resemblance to Sinead O'Connor made us wonder why they just didn't go whole hog and put O'Connor in the movie.  She's not the world's most interesting actress but she seemed to be giving it her all, so we wound up liking her even at the same time as we were thinking how  tiny she is, like a little elf.  And the torture scenes seemed so unrealistic, like wouldn't a sneeze blow her against the prison cell wall and splat her like a flyswatter?  No way could she withstand the abuse she's dealt out in this movie.  I thought she had it bad in GARDEN STATE being forced into kookiness the whole time but here she has to represent the entire viewership of the movie as she (and by extension, ourselves) are argued and browbeaten into radical politics, possibly anarchy, by a well-written screenplay and a series of haunting, scary images on the screen.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving fares better, even with his painted on china (or is it bulletproof steel) mask and its great painted grin, like a merry-go-round horse grinning in a death rictus.  I thought it strange that he would choose as his theme song "Cry Me a River," but the other song he plays, by Antony and the Johnsons, really hit the note of the sexually "other."  When V falls in love with Evey, it really does change his plans as well as his perspective on the ultimate meaning of life and death.  As a love story, V FOR VENDETTA is a little bit similar to MY FAIR LADY.<br /><br />Is there some special pleading in the movie for gay and lesbian civil rights?  I don't see how you can read the subplots of Gordon Dietrich and of Valerie Page any other way.  My hat is off to a mainstream American movie that dares to raise these issues in the current climate of rightwing homophobia.<br /><br />Someone at the theater said the filmmakers had originally cast James Purefoy, whom I remember as the faun in NARNIA, to play V, then after a few scenes realized he wasn't working out, similarly to the way Viggo Mortensen wound up replacing Stuart Townsend as Aragorn in THE LORD OF THE RINGS.  I watched the movie and I concur with the filmmaker's decision.  I just can't imagine V played by anyone else but Weaving.  But this isn't really an actor's movie, is it?  (Although Stephen Rea does some magnificently simple yet enthralling work as Chief Inspector Finch, the policeman who gradually goes over to the "dark side.")  I was astounded by the way that, individual plots points and loose threads seem to disappear into outer space while leaving us with a modern fable of great power and communal beauty and fire.</p></body></html>

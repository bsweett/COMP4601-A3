<meta name="summary" content="See it for the performances alone"></head><body><p>From director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, the story of 21 Grams links three people who are united by very tragic circumstances.  Paul (Sean Penn) is terminally ill, but finds a new lease on life after receiving a heart transplant from the recently deceased husband of Cristina (Naomi Watts).  Her husband was killed in a freak accident by Jack (Benicio Del Toro), an ex-con looking for redemption.  As the film shifts back and forth through time, we see the events that lead these people to being united, and it doesn't end well for anyone involved.  The intricate screenplay isn't half as smart as it thinks it is, but the performances from Penn, Watts, and Del Toro are nothing short of brilliant.  Penn's subtle turn is one of his most masterful (he was the only one of the three who weren't nominated for an Oscar for this film, but he took home a Best Actor award for Mystic River the same year), while Watts gives a wonderful and emotional tour de force, and Del Toro is simply brilliant.  Still, 21 Grams attempts to weave an intricate web that isn't as multi-faceted as it thinks it is, but the film still manages to be something special based on the performances of the three leads alone, and they alone are worth seeing the film for.</p></body></html>

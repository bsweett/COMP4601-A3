<meta name="summary" content="A "RAT" ICAL NEW ANIMATED MOVIE! EXCELLENT!"></head><body><p>I went to the theater to see this animated tale of a cleaver rodent who dreams of being a chef. The story is well written and seemed geared more for adults,kids should enjoy it too. The animation is incredible and some great voice work by Oswalt and company. I wrote this review after seeing this film in theaters and I am adding some comments about the DVD release.<br />The DVD has an excellent transfer but, the extras are a little thin for such an interesting film. I smell a 2 disc in the future which is bound to "tick off" consumers. There are two very good shorts on the DVD release to save this release from being rather "bare boned".</p></body></html>

Not that I wouldn't or shouldn't expect that level of performance from Washington, but that this was a good role for him, and he performs well.  This certainly would not have been a role for  Sylvester Stallone or Vin Diesel! In Man on Fire, a related series of kidnappings in Mexico City leads everybody who can afford it to hire a bodyguard.  Washington plays John Creasy, a bodyguard to nine-year old Pita Ramos.  As you might expect, Pita is kidnapped, and there is the movie.<br /><br />The cinematography is excellent, the directing intentionally choppy at times for (great) effect, and the plot makes sense, from the quid pro quo relationship of the top cop with the top reporter to how Creasy is so comfortable about weapons.<br /><br />My two complaints?  I have no knowledge of the adventures of Creasy before he shows up on the scene.  The director teases the viewer with this!  Also, the actor playing industrialist Samuel Ramos seems miscast here... too young looking, too immature, and too much time hanging around at home.<br /><br />Rated R for violence.  The bad guys get what's coming to them.</p></body></html>

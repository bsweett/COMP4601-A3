<meta name="summary" content="Disturbingly Compelling"></head><body><p>This is a brutally told but compelling version of the Aileen Wuornos story.  She was a deranged psycho, sure, but Charlize Theron's "monster" performance also allowed us an insider's view into the woman and her troubled past.  While there can be no excusing her actions, this movie makes it possible at least to understand why she turned to prostitution, and then ultimately to murder.<br /><br />Christina Ricci is also excellent as the lonely lesbian who befriends Wuornos, and inadvertently, at least at first, sparks the violence that rages within Wuornos' troubled mind.  As the story unfolds however, the tough hooker becomes putty-like in the hands of the disatisfied, nagging girlfriend, falling deeper and deeper into trouble, in an effort to buy happiness for their most unlikely partnership.<br /><br />While certainly disturbing and at times depressing, you'll find yourself unable to turn away, even though you already know how this story ends.<br /><br />To assist the people who are watching this movie for the ...ummm.. "Cinematic experience", your chapters are six and fifteen on the DVD, and your new favorite song is "Crimson and Clover".<br /><br />Well performed and directed, and thoroughly deserving of all the awards that have been heaped on it.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, November 26, 2004</p></body></html>

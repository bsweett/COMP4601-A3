<meta name="summary" content="Worth seeing, but not the greatest comedy ever made..."></head><body><p>I have finally seen Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, and it was very funny.  It is not, as some people have said, one of the greatest comedies ever made, nor it is particularly good satire.  Many scenes are really just done to provoke people, and this they do very well.  It's not very difficult to offend southerners (or anyone else for that matter) when you bring a prostitute to their house, or when you take a dump and bring it down in a bag, or the scene where Borat and his producer run through a hotel naked.  Most of the targets here are quite easy, and there really isn't any wit here at work.  With that said, there are many hilarious scenes, like the opening segment, the driving instructor (who is very funny himself), the weather man (who manages to upstage Borat), Borat's insulting of the feminists, and the camraderie Borat has with some bruthas in the hood.  It may be interesting to note that Borat's encounters with black people in the film are the most congenial, as they are very nice to him and treat him well.  His meetings with white people are usually hostile and confrontational.  This is a film worth seeing, but it's not a revolutionary comedy or anything of the sort.  We probably won't see another Borat film (at least not like this one), because everyone's in on the joke now.  Just a note--for those wishing to see/hear Borat's legendary ditty "Throw the Jew Down the Well" and see his "Jew Hunting" segment with a Texas hunter, those are NOT in this film.  They are part of the Ali G. show, where this character originated.  The film is worth seeing, definitely, but probably just once, maybe twice...</p></body></html>

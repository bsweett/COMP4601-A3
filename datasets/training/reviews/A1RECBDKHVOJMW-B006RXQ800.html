<meta name="summary" content="A Riveting Film About A Remarkable Episode In NYC's History!"></head><body><p>Martin Scorsese has created a masterpiece with his long awaited "Gangs Of New York." Though the film is far from perfect, Scorsese has succeeded in fulfilling his desire to make a movie about New York City's gangs, and underworld elements, during the corrupt reign of "Boss Tweed" and Tammany Hall. He also portrays the plight of poor Irish immigrants, and the prejudice they face when arriving in New York. Scorsese's attention to detail, the sets, costumes and period language, provide a spectacular and realistic backdrop for this very energetic historical film. He effectively incorporates the personal lives of his characters with the film's political and historical elements - really superior work!<p>My primary issue with the film, is that while the Irish did cause a tremendous riot, and murdered African-Americans, the film didn't focus on the reasons for this historical event, or really clarify, even for a brief period of the movie's 168 minutes, the reason for the riots. Instead, the upheaval was portrayed as something that grew out of the gang wars. Scorsese's interpretation skews history a bit, and leaves the viewer wondering why African-Americans were being victimized. Or perhaps that part of the film was left on the cutting room floor.<p>By 1860, one of every four New York City residents was an Irish-born immigrant. They worked as unskilled laborers on the docks, as ditch diggers and street pavers, and as cartmen and coal heavers. They competed directly with the city's African-American workers for jobs. The racial tension ran high before the war, and peaked in 1863. The National Conscription Act was passed in March 1863. Many immigrants were drafted right off the boat, knowing little about the cause, or politics, of the War Between the States. In the spring of 1863, in the midst of a strike of Irish dock workers, strikers attacked and beat African-American strike-breakers before federal troops arrived to protect the black workers. It is during these "Draft Riots" that the film's extraordinary finale takes place.<p>The action begins in 1846. A group of Irish immigrants living in the Five Points slums of New York City are part of the "Dead Rabbits Gang." They are led by the noble priest Vallon, (Liam Neeson), in a turf war about control over the money they earn, and over the streets of the Five Points slums, on New York's lower East Side. The already well established "Natives Gang," Protestants whose ancestors fought in the War of Independence, are extremely prejudiced against the Irish Catholics. Bill "the Butcher" Cutting, (brilliantly played by Daniel Day- Lewis, who always turns in a superb performance), is the "Nativist" gang leader, who collects a portion of everyone's earnings, and runs the local gangs and underworld criminals. He conspires with "Boss Tweed" and the local police to make more money, lining the politicians pockets as he does so. During the gang fight, filmed using dramatic camera shots, unusual angles, occasional slow motion, and backed by an extraordinary musical score, Vallon is killed by "The Butcher." The priest has a young son, Amsterdam Vallon, who witnesses everything and swears revenge. "The Butcher" places the boy in an institution, where he lives for the next sixteen years. When he is released, Amsterdam (Leonardo Di Caprio), goes back to "Five Points" looking to settle his score with "The Butcher." Unexpectedly, Bill takes a liking to Amsterdam, who assumes an alias to protect his identity. The two form a bond, of sorts, which makes it difficult for the young Vallon to take his revenge.<p>What follows is an absolutely riveting movie, with an excellent cast. The actors certainly shine under Scorsese's direction. Daniel Day-Lewis' character, the charismatic, barbaric psychopath Bill, is the film's central figure. Day-Lewis is one of the most talented actors in the industry. Although I do not care for Leonardo DiCaprio, he puts in a decent performance as Amsterdam Vallon. Cameron Diaz's, as the quick fingered Jenny, lover of young Amsterdam, more than holds her own. The supporting cast is top-notch. I do think the editing could have been done better, to provide a smoother flow. However, with all its flaws, "Gangs of New York" is well worth watching and deserves a full five stars!<br />JANA</p></body></html>

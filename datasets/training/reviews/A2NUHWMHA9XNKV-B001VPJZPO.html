<meta name="summary" content="it was actually good ...who would have thought..."></head><body><p>Chilling and Suspenseful<br /><br />This movie was amazing and frightening. It's about a woman living in an old mansion where she faces ghosts and hoodoo, where she must discover the truth behind the house's past...and herself. It was amazing, scary and very good. It was scary and suspenseful, and Kate Hudson gave a superb performance, and also Peter Saarsgard, and Caroline's friend in the movie.<br /><br />The ending had me doing a 180 because it caught me off guard, just when you thought you figured it out its not what you thought was going to happen, i hope you got that (:D)</p></body></html>

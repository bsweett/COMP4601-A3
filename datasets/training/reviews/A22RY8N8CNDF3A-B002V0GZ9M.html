<meta name="summary" content="Mailbox Madness"></head><body><p>The Lake House is a science fiction romance of two people separated by two years in time, but communicate with letters.  The letters are left in a mailbox at the Lake House where they both reside at different times.  The mailbox is the worm hole to both the past and future.  The first letter is from Dr. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) to the new occupant Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) asking him to forward her mail if any is missed by the post office and the paw prints at the front door were there when she moved in.  She loved the house as she felt relief from stress there.  Alex also feels deeply about the house as his father (Christopher Plummer) designed and built it.<br /><br />Alex noted a stray dog left paw prints, but after the note from Dr. Forster.  He puts a letter in the mailbox asking how she could have known about this.  That is how the communication connects even though they are separated in time by two years.  Alex dates his letters 2004 and Kate dates hers 2006.<br /><br />The movie whipsaws you between time and also confusion on how the movie finally ends.  The threads of the premise do not make sense and this is obvious in the ending scenes.<br /><br />If the viewer can take the leap of faith on time travel and changing destiny you will have a good time watching.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="So much potential, so much left on the table..."></head><body><p>The cast, headed by Hugh Grant, was so promising that 5-10 minutes into the movie you figure the movie must have cost an arm and a leg to produce...<br /><br />Though funny at many points, the movie starts to get diluted very early in the game, with so many different plots, that you start "missing" characters until they come back much later into the movie. The biggest problem with this plethora of plots is that most of them are resolved quite poorly, or left unclear. Barely a couple of the stories kept me engaged all the way through, specially since so many of them had such a weird ending.<br /><br />As much expectation as we had for this chick flick, it turned out to be quite dissapointing. Save yourself the time and rent some other Hugh Grant movie. As for this one, definitely not his best or a good movie worth checking out.</p></body></html>

Borat is basically an outrageously funny and obscene take on the idea of the uncultured barbarian who goes to the "big city" to see how the other half lives, and has various outlandish adventures along the way. From the 5000 year old Sumerian story, The Epic of Gilgamesh to Midnight Cowboy and hundreds of other stories and films, this idea has provided an inexhaustible gold mine of funny and outrageous material for storytellers  for thousands of years. This movie is no different; it's just far more risque, outrageous, and possibly tasteless, but loses none of its comic potential for that. Cohen and his partner (can't recall his name) are both superb in their roles and the whole cast really looks like they're having a good time with this outlandish and uproarious farce that constantly looks like it's going to spin out of control. Even the most jaded movie fan should find something funny or just different in Borat.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Interesting changes, still not as good as original"></head><body><p>`The Wicker Man' done originally in 1974 is a great English cult film, similar in many ways to the earlier English film version of William Golding's high school favorite novel, `Lord of the Flies'. And, just like `Lord of the Flies', we are now treated to a Hollywood remake of this classic with co-producer Nicholas Cage in the lead role created by Australian actor, Edward Woodward in the original flick.<br /><br />I am happy to say that the remake of `The Wicker Man' is better than the remake of `Lord of the Flies', where the filmmakers seemed to totally miss the point of Golding's story. The new `The Wicker Man' did change a fair amount of the story, but largely what was really essential to moving the scene from an island off Scotland to an American island in Washington State, in Puget Sound.<br /><br />The primary problem faced by the filmmakers is that in the original story, much was made of the traditional English class system with a traditional Manor House landlord, emphasis on the `lord' business in charge of the `private island' with an otherwise very peculiar social system. The modern storytellers got a lot of mileage out of their paradigm shift from English noble to cult matriarch at the head of a little society patterned after the society of bees, which happens to also be the island's main industry, replacing the orchard agriculture in the English original. These changes are to the good. The only problem with the switch from apples to bees is that while apples are not normally grown on the Scottish islands, bees are not at all out of place in Puget Sound. This looses a useful clue to the unusual nature of this island community.<br /><br /> Another fairly effective change is to make the lead character policeman (Cage) allergic to bee stings. Somewhat less effective is providing the California policeman with a back story which connects him to a resident of the Summersisle community (The modern movie adds an extra `s' to aid in pronouncing the name), making him the father of the missing little girl, the bait which the mother uses to draw cop Cage to the island.<br /><br />I think the problem with this backstory is that while Cage and Woodward are both playing policemen, Cage is out of his jurisdiction and his police authority is really a shadow with no real weight. Woodward, on the other hand, has official standing on his island and is fully authorized to make arrests and conduct investigations.<br /><br />Otherwise, the story plays out in almost exactly parallel scenes starting at the point at which Cage arrives at on the island.<br /><br />The original movie had a purely realistic story, where the only supernatural element was in the island inhabitants' beliefs. There were no supernatural threats and not even too many menacing flashbacks or dreams. The remake remained true to this point of view, and improved on it just a bit by drawing parallels between the Summersisle community and the Amish, where both exhibited anti-technological biases. I think I also saw a hint of parallel being drawn to the puritan witches of Salem, Massachusetts.<br /><br />Of course, nature was called in to help out by blanking out cell phone reception on the island. One problem both movies shared is that they were marketed as `horror' movies. While the sense of threat is constant throughout most of the movie, it is not really the kind of supernatural threat we get in most Stephen King stories. Like `Psycho' and `Ten Little Indians', the source of threat is entirely based on purely human, albeit quite pathological, behavior. The isolated venue does create similarities with stories such as `Alien' and `House on Haunted Hill' where the victim(s) are physically cut off from any outside help, but here, the primary thing keeping Cage / Woodward on the island is the obsession with the lost girl. I also note a strong similarity with the movie `Don't Look Now' where the plot is driven by fleeting glimpses of a little lost girl.<br /><br />In the end, the modern `The Wicker Man' makes the Summersisle inhabitants just a bit more loony and therefore just a bit less believable in their realistic setting. While one can easily imagine descendants of Druids celebrating May Day with animalistic costumes, neither the Amish nor a hippie holdover connection works quite as well. Too bad cinema finances prevented the filmmakers from keeping the venue back in the old country. While Cage is a superb actor, I think Woodward's matter of fact, `just the facts, Madam' tone of the English constable fits against the background of the tree worshipping islanders. The islanders don't have to be quite so bizarre to stand out behind Woodward's low-key tone. This also means that the original movie gives much less away early on. The unraveling of the threat and the climax comes more slowly and subtly. But when it does, it's a far bigger surprise.<br /><br />Last but not least, I think the current director, Neil LaBute, should have studied the camera work on the last scene of the original more carefully. The original director did a much better job of revealing the climax venue, even in black and white.<br /><br />So, while Cage is ultimately a more interesting actor than Woodward, I would still recommend the original over the remake if what you want is a really good rendition of the story. I will say that the modern `The Wicker Man' has my favorite DVD extra, a commentary soundtrack including the director, editor, and a few of the lesser actors (I think casting Ellen Burstyn was a waste of her talent. They did such a good job of casting the minor women on the island, but Burstyn just didn't seem to work as the queen bee.). This commentary easily doubles the value of the DVD. The `shocking Alternate Ending' is just a bit more graphic violence added to the telling of the final scene, which adds nothing to the meat of the story.</p></body></html>

I'm a very curious guy so when I was told there is something so insanely mesmerising about this film, I saw it again and even after watching it twice, I failed to feel it. This film is self conscious, stuckup, morally confused and pretty badly edited. I found two scenes in this film which tried to be very thunderous but failed miserably at evoking any sort of amusement or "whoa" out of me, except the original intented intent.I did not sleep during this film. It isnt the worst film I have ever seen. I'd still give it a four.<br /><br />All this is my opinion. Try not to knock on me.<br /><br />Do I hate it? I seldom use such strong words, but Yes, with every beat in my "Man On the moon" loving, Jim Carrey Fan HEART.</p></body></html>

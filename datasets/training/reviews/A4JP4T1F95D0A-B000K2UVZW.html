De Palma tries way to hard to make this movie stylish.  It just doesn't work.  The actors are very flat, which is suprising considering the all star talent.  The story itself is a jumble, which is confusing and boring throughout the movie and then tries to pull itself together at the end for the big reveal.  But this is no Usual Suspects.  You leave this movie feeling like you've been cheated of 2 hours of your life.  I wouldn't even bother with a rental of this one.  Wait for cable.</p></body></html>

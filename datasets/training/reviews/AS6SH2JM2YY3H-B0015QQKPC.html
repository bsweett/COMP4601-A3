Now, with Apollo 13, we were returning to conduct more experiments and to refine the technology for space travel.<br /><br />But an explosion disabled the mission on the way to the Moon, and the mission goal became the safe return of the three astronauts, Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise.<br /><br />The reviews of this film have all been written.  Suffice it to say that actors Tom Hanks and Ed Harris were magnificent, as was Gary Sinise and a whole host of lessor actors representing the Apollo ground crew.<br /><br />Ron Howard really directed a wonderful tale of this chapter in space exploration.  I wonder how audiences will react to it 50, 100, and 500 years from now?  It is a great story, and should continue to entertain audiences for generations.</p></body></html>

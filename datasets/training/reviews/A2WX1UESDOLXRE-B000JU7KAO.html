<meta name="summary" content="Originality and Innovation in New Shyamalan Film"></head><body><p>In a Hollywood world where no idea is original, M. Night Shyamalan captures his creativity in a bottle, putting it into words, images, and emotions. Many critics pan his movies. Why? Do they ever lack originality? No. Do they ever lack emotion? Certainly not. Though the plot of Lady in the Water may be unfathomable in terms of "reality," it's original. No one knocked J.K. Rowling for creating a crazy world of wizards and muggles: M. Night deserves the same respect. So perhaps the critical dismissal of his work is something that needs to be reconsidered. This is visually and emotionally stunning film. Each frame in the film is a delicate picture, and Shyamalan's eye for detail reveals his genius.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti stars as Cleveland, a stuttering apartment super who dutifully does his job, never complaining and always willing to help. One night, he slips and is knocked unconscious by the pool, only to awake in his apartment with a half-naked girl sitting on the couch opposite him. The girl's name is Story (Bryce Dallas Howard), and she tells him that she comes from the Blue World. She needs help. She must look into the eyes of "the vessel," a person living in our world because this fateful meeting will awaken something inside this person, something that will be the seeds of positive change in the world. But there are evils looking to stop her. Scrunts are red-eyed creatures that live in the grass, and they'll kill Story if they get the chance.<br /><br />It's no secret that "the vessel" is a writer played by M. Night himself. And the book his character is working on is one that will not be appreciated in his time because everyone is a critic. (And the critic who lives in the apartment complex is appropriately dealt with near the end of the movie.) And everyone has something negative to say. I refuse to say anything negative about this movie. Because I can't find anything negative to say. The script is original-- a bedtime story that Shyamalan created for his children, full of childlike wonder and mystery. Leave your pre-conceived notions about Shyamalan at the theater entrance. Rediscover your inner-child and simply enjoy the movie. Is it really so hard to do? Is it really so hard to not be a cynical critic?<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</p></body></html>

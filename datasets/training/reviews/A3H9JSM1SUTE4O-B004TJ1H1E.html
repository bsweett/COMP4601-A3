And it's hard to imagine any film, foreign or domestic, that could top this timeless masterpiece about two skirt-chasing Chicago musicians (Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis), on the run from the mob who don drag and discover love while hiding -- and performing -- with an all woman band headed to Florida.<br /><br />The screenplay by director Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond is unerring as it mixes desperate comedy and a convoluted battle of the sexes.  Marilyn Monroe, though often half-naked, maintains her innocent, sexy and vulnerable personae as disappointed-in-love lead singer Sugar Kane.  (With what's on the screen, it's hard to believe Monroe was on her worst behavior during the troubled shoot.) Lemmon starts tightly wound, becomes ever more unhinged and then snaps into a dangerously comfortable mode as his "Daphne" character is pursued by the amorous and enamored retiree Joe. E. Brown Curtis, in his perfect Cary Grant-voiced alter ego, is feckless as he tries to get Sugar to help him feel passion.<br /><br />The pristine Special Edition disc features a revealing conversation with Tony Curtis and Leonard Maltin, a featurette on all-female bands (for more on girl bands, read the sensational "Swing Shift" by Sherrie Tucker, Duke University Press, 2000), behind-the-scene images, pressbook gallery and trailers from Billy Wilder films. A perfect, must-own film.  From MGM.  (1959, Not Rated, Widescreen, 122 Minutes.)</p></body></html>

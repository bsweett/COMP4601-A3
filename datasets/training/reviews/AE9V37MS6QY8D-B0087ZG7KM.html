<meta name="summary" content="The best comedy of the year! (yes, I'm safe in making that claim.)"></head><body><p>Before I say what I'm going to about this film, this is going to sound difficult to do but don't go in with high expectations 'cause then you won't think it as funny as it is. OK, here it goes: "Bridesmaids" is the funniest movie I've seen (so far) this year!!! This film is just plain hilarious! Don't go thinking this is some female version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VQZ5BO">The Hangover (Extreme Edition)</a>. It may have "Hangover"s raunchy humor but it has a hell of a lot more heart without the simple <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXS7">Dude, Where's My Car?</a>-like plot. Although, appearing from the advertising, this may seem like it's all about the bachelorette party, it's not. The film does not primarily focus on all six girls, but particularly Rudolph (the bride-to-be), Wiig (the maid of honor), and Byrne (the new, rich best friend). Byrne, who is known mostly for drama (FX's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003IPCRWS">Damages: The Complete Seasons 1-2</a>), does wonders in comedy; to catch her prior comedic performance, check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG97PG">Get Him to the Greek (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>. And Melissa McCarthy shines as Megan, the future sister-in-law, who -- along with Wiig -- owns most of the laughs in the film! Kemper basically plays her other cute, girl-next-door role Erin (from NBC's "The Office") but does well at it. McLendon-Covey (Comedy Central's "Reno 911") also does well as the mom of three boys who needs to run wild. And Jon Hamm (AMC's "Mad Men"), who proves that drama is not his only talent, is great as the jerky pretty-boy, booty-call buddy, Ted. But the triumvirate of Wiig, Rudolph and Byrne are the best ones here! Their chemistry truly compliments this film. The movie, co-written by Wiig, not only is hugely humorous, but also speaks to the very reality that is how catty and territorial woman can sometimes be with each other (i.e., when Wiig feels her role as best friend is being taken over by Byrne). The great thing about the film, besides the laughs, is the true message that Wiig's Annie has to learn as things in her life fall apart all around her. She has to step up and learn to respect herself, not feel sorry for herself, and at the same time be sensitive to others. This may sound like a bummer or too deep for a comedy, but the film pulls it all off without being pretentious or too deep.<br /><br />Both Wiig and Rudolph have shined in previous roles and proved their acting chops -- Wiig in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VPTJOA">Whip It</a> and Rudolph in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0021L8UOY">Away We Go</a>. Their friendship in the movie is what overall sells the story. And Wiig's blooming romance with Irish policeman Officer Rhodes (a likeable everyman Chris O'Dowd) does not get in the way of the overall story nor distract from it. If anything, it helps it along and I applaud writers Wiig and Annie Mumolo (who has a cameo as Wiig's neurotic flight co-passenger) for correctly balancing it all without a hitch, and a special shout-out to producer Judd Apatow and director Paul Feig (creator of "Freaks and Geeks") for having the wisdom to take on the story. This film attempts what I believe writer Nancy Pimental was trying to do when she wrote the 2002 Cameron Diaz stinker, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000069HYG">The Sweetest Thing (Unrated Edition)</a>. Pimental was attempting to incorporate the gross-out humor of male comedy films such as "Knocked Up," but also trying to make a touching female-bonding film. In my mind, Pimental, the director (Roger Kumble) and cast all failed. The film came off to me like some pathetic attempt at making women too much like guys. However, "Bridesmaids" balances the raunchy with the endearing with great success!<br /><br />This film works for both sexes: women will LOVE to view it with girlfriends and men will love it for not having to roll their eyes! That's how downright funny and enjoyable this film is! The only thing I have to warn you about is that you may have to see it a second time just to catch the funny lines you missed from you (and the audience) laughing so loud and hard.</p></body></html>

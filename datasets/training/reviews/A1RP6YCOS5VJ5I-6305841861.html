There are plenty of scenes that will make you jump if you don't know what is coming, but there is a lot of laughs as well. In one word, the movie is fun. Bruce Campbell carries the film since it really does focus on his character and changes Ash from a quiet person into this explosive action hero that you can't help but cheer on! Every time I think of my favorite scenes, the majority of them involve Ash, which is what makes him such a great character. The big scene I immediately think of is when he fights his own hand, you'll just have to watch to see that for yourself.<br /><br />A bigger budget was used in the making of this movie, but some B qualities still can be seen in the movie. Such as you can see there is no roof to the cabin when Ash is trying to out run the deadite spirit following him into the house. Another instance being when the eye pops out of the deadite, you can see the little black piece of plastic making the eye fly. Small things like that do not effect this movie, the story is compelling and you will ignore anything that seems cheesy. There is too much good about the movie and will always win over anything bad that can be said about this movie.<br /><br />People kept asking after watching the first movie, why wasn't Ash every possessed in the first film when all of his friends were? Well, he gets to be possessed in this film in more than one occasion, so it goes to show that even he isn't immune. Overall, this is another MUST SEE! I have watched the movie many times and this is definitely something that will never get old.</p></body></html>

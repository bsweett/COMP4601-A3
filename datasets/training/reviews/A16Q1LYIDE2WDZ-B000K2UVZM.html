<meta name="summary" content="The Boring Dahlia"></head><body><p>This movie is a serious snooze-fest. It has a well-known cast but they all seemed wrong for the part. Even the most talented actors would not have been able to save this awful script. The movie has a weak, fragmented plot which is a shame because the Black Dahlia murder is a fascinating case and there were some interesting historical events going on at that time. The movie fails to bring any excitement to the story or the time period.  I didn't feel like I was "transported" to 1947. I felt like I was watching dressed up actors playing parts on phony sets. The 1947 ambiance wasn't there and neither was the look.<br /><br />The movie is also very slow paced. We don't even get to Elizabeth Short's story until almost a half hour into the movie. There are also a lot of pointless side stories about boxers, love triangles, adultery, prostitutes, crime, lesbians and whatnot...to the degree that the original point of the movie is lost. This movie is trying to be too many things at once and in doing this a very sad but interesting story is only half told. About 25 minutes of the movie is devoted to the Black Dahlia. The rest of the movie is pretty much made up of fictional characters and invented stories.<br /><br />It seems like this movie was trying to be a film noir. It really missed the mark. It seemed really modern and `glossy' and had none of the shadows or the dark creepy feel that a film noir should have. Everything seemed too bright, too fake and too pretty. This wasn't a movie about a murdered woman. It was a movie about cops, criminals and sex. In spite of this, there isn't any emphasis on the fact that this was a very shocking crime at the time. In 1947 things like this didn't happen. It was never solved. This could have given the story some great film noir elements but unfortunately the people responsible for this mess didn't understand true film noir.<br /><br />The movie failed to capture the feel of the 40's era on other levels. Some of the costumes were cool to look at but they didn't have the right look when you compare them to actual movies made in that decade. The actors didn't seem like they ever watched a 1940's movie. The cast was good looking in more a 2000's way than a 1940's way. Beauty trends have changed. The look wasn't there, the accents weren't there. The acting wasn't there and the contrast between glamor and grit wasn't there either...something crucial to good noir...<br /><br />There is a lot of smoking in the movie and apparently actors of today can't smoke a cigarette and act at the same time! It didn't seem natural. In film noir the lighting is such that it captures the cigarette smoke and creates contrast and an air of mystery. In 40's movies they had a smoking scene strategically placed...usually when things got intense, just like in real life. In this movie everyone is just running around puffing away and it isn't adding to the movie. Unless smoking is used to capture lighting, a mood or make an intense scene more believable, it is a waste. I have no issue with smoking in movies but the actors looked like they were faking it and it wasn't adding to the ambiance or the visuals.<br /><br />I also didn't like the lack of respect the movie had for the victim Elizabeth Short. The movie was totally insensitive to the fact that she was a real human being and probably had people who loved her. There was nothing in the movie to humanize her. Even her 'father' in the movie doesn't have any remorse or sadness. This doesn't seem believable. Instead of telling us who Elizabeth was as a person, the movie basically portrays her as a tramp that deserved her fate. The real Elizabeth may not have been innocent but no matter what she did wrong in her life, no human being deserves such a horrible death. The movie was delivered more like a glossy, fabricated drama rather than a real life event. The writers added so much "filler" to the story trying to beef it up that they lose the point and they lose the audience. The movie goes overboard with cheap thrills and too many sex scenes. The movie doesn't build sympathy for any of the characters. In the end there really is no message.<br /><br />Even though we already know the story of The Black Dahlia there was a lot about her and the case that were left out. The movie goes off in another direction and forgets one crucial fact: The case is STILL a mystery! A great movie could have been made about this story but this movie failed miserably. Hopefully, one day there will be a movie that honors the life and probes the real mystery of Elizabeth. Until then, we are stuck with this dreck of a movie. Do yourself a favor and don't watch it! Elizabeth was someone's daughter. If she was mine I would want a movie which better represents who she really was...not this exploitive pile of garbage movie which is written like a cheap novel. I hear the book is better but after seeing this movie, that doesn't seem hard to do. If I want to know more about this case, I think I will stick with the documentaries!</p></body></html>

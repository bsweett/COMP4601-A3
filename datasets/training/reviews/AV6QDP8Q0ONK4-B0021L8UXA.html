<meta name="summary" content="GOOD TENSE MOVIE"></head><body><p>The movie starts out showing a town in flames, then quickly jumps to "two days" earlier. The action starts rather fast. Character is built during the action scenes. A man with a shotgun walks out into center field during a baseball game. After a brief confrontation, the sheriff has to shoot him. Soon another man goes crazy and burns his family to death. The sheriff quickly figures what has happened as they find a downed plane in the marsh which supplies the drinking water to the town. At this point the movie had the feel of "Impulse" (1984). When they go back to town the cell phone doesn't work, nor can they get on-line. The sheriff recognizes something is wrong and ventures out into the street of the deserted town of Ogden Marsh, Iowa. The military comes in and rounds up people into camps/ separating out infected and non-infected with an ear thermometer. The sheriff and his wife lead a small group of people out of the area, believing that if they could just make it to Cedar Rapids, they would be fine.(Death or Cedar Rapids is coin toss for most folks.) Meanwhile they have to battle crazies, hide from the military, and watch each other for signs of being crazy. Radha Mitchell is this generation's Lynda Day George. The acting was above par for B horror. There are some different killing scenes then the normal slasher films. My favorite was the guy dragging the pitch fork (cover) into a hospital room where the patients are strapped into beds. The pitch fork grates along the floor like chalk on a blackboard. No nudity or sex. The f-bomb gets dropped once that I recall.</p></body></html>

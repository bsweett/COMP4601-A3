Anyway, the movie starts off great, but then by the time you get midway though, it gets way too overly clever and starts to use redundant plot characterizations over and over again. So in the end the beginning is great, then doesn't give a pay off until the end which is a novel twist at best for the sake of some sobering "realism" within the giant monster genre.<br /><br />I just ordered and watched a ton of Godzilla, Gamera movies prior to this, and they are stupid, yet typically much more enjoyable than this movie since your suspension of disbelief is non existent regarding those types of fun movies. The problem i found with this movie was that it TRIED to be more serious and most of the character actions were plain stupid. If you know you're dealing with this type of creature why act so stupid? And they showed almost next to no action taken by the military or local police in trying to strategize and capture, analyze of kill the creature at all.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this film, i'd suggest renting it or watching at a friends house before buying to own it. I was really excited to check it out but it comes up far short of what i was anticipating overall. Perhaps in time i'll find this fits a certain mood and i'll enjoy it more? doubt it, i'll just pop in King Kong Escapes and have a real good time laughing instead.<br /><br />Update: this movie grows on you, it's more moody and less predictable than most giant monster films... basically it's a more artistic approach to the genre. I'll add an extra star making it a 4 star rating for myself.</p></body></html>

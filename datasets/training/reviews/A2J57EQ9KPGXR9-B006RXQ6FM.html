<meta name="summary" content="And The Oscar Goes to....."></head><body><p>Some reviewers referred to Doubt as a film for big-lobed geniuses. Others called it garbage.<br /><br />  Doubt falls somewhere in the middle. This film is not garbage - its designed and was released to get Academy Awards; and like a machine well-designed for a purpose, it does its job. Doubt pushes all the right emotional buttons, has all the right actors and actresses and the story is heavy enough to get the Academy's attention. Plus it contrasts nicely with the Holocaust-related films that are usually a shoe-in at the Oscars.<br /><br />  Even though this film is Oscar bait, Doubt is not bad. I liked the performances in the film and it is not boring. Sure, there are no car crashes nor explosions, but Doubt can still be considered a decent rental, if not a sale purchase.<br /><br />  To the "garbage" reviewers: I recommend "The Man From Earth" - a "thinking person's" movie, but it is not Oscar-bait and it is very entertaining.</p></body></html>

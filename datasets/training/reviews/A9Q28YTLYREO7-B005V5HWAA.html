<meta name="summary" content="it was ok"></head><body><p>the film was interesting,but  predictable. Kevin Costner was cool and William Hurt was interesting in a Anthony Hopkins kind of vibe. Dane cook just didn't show me much in this film and Demi Moore's was ok,but the film tried to take on way too many things and just  was all over the place. too many storylines and not any real answers. this film should have been really good,but it fell over it's ownself before it got going. this film reminded me so much of the  Showtime show "Dexter" except Dexter catches who he is after. this film just leaves alot of tracks but so many things  are left with a question mark.</p></body></html>

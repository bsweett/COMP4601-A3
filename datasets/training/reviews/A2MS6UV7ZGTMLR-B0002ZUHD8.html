<meta name="summary" content="Not that great,but still an interesting watch..."></head><body><p>It seems that in recent time historians have decided to correct the tale of King Arthur and unfortunately turn it from a romantic, magical and heroic tale, into one of a 5th century soldier of Rome, serving Roman-Imperial England against the savage battle-driven Saxons with the aid of a warrior version of Guinevere. Although this version is supposedly more historically accurate of King Arthur and is backed up by archaeological proof, I personally prefer the glorified romantic version. That's not to say that this isn't a good movie, because it still is. It may have its faults, but it definitely has its good points as well.<br /><br />While many of the actors were believable in their roles, and while Clive Owen is a great actor, I didn't think that he had the screen presence to really make me believe that he could demand the loyalty and dedication of his followers that he supposedly did. I think he might be more suited to a non-leading role than the role of a `King' such as Arthur. Keira Knightly played Guinevere great considering the limitations of the script. My only gripe with her is actually unrelated to her acting, and once again script related. This version of Guinevere is a strong, battle-adept warrior of a woman initially fighting against the Romans, and yet she so easily succumbs to the charm of Arthur, someone wholly dedicated to what she hates with a passion. This weakness just wasn't in character even knowing that her cause took a back seat in light of the invading Saxons.<br /><br />Regardless of criticism of the film script, the detail to historical accuracy of the time and location with respect to the costumes and settings is extremely impressive. The surroundings and somber lighting really pull you into the Era and create a highly believable world. And although the battle scenes never really brought anything new to the table, the battle on the frozen river in the mountains gave of a realism that had me shivering with the chill of the surroundings and the anxiety of the battle. With the 13 minutes of additional battle footage in this `Director's Cut', the battle's include that little bit more action, blood and gore that add to the realism and have you cringing at the sight of torn flesh.</p></body></html>

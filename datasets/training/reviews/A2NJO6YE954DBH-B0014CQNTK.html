The only two movies selected for such an accolade at the present time were the Coen Brothers' "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YDDP7I">No Country for Old Men</a>" and "Juno."  I have already told you everything I know about the former, but of the latter I had heard nothing.  However, Roger Ebert's review of "Juno" appeared in the paper, and after scanning the first two paragraphs, where he calls it "just about the best movie of the year" and raves about Ellen Page's performance, I decided I wanted to see the movie.  The accompanying photograph showed Page running down the stairs in front of her house in between Allison Janney and J.K. Simmmons.  Recognizing the cast was enough to confirm my decision and I did not bother to read the caption for the photograph or the rest of the review.  Consequently, I sat in the theater today to watch "Juno" without any idea of what it was about and I hope that some of you are fortunate enough to have the same experience because with all the time you know what a movie is supposed to be about and you are bitterly disappointed, being pleasantly surprised and falling in love with a movie is pretty sweet.<br /><br />So I am not going to say anything about what the movie is about, although as a teaching of Classical Greek & Roman Mythology I feel compelled to point out that Juno is the wife of Jupiter in Roman mythology and not in Greek mythology, where she is called Hera (Juno is a much better name for the lead character in this movie).  I am going to say that first time writer Diablo Cody should win the Oscar for Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen on the basis of his dialogue in this movie.  At first I was thinking that the dialogue is like a condensed compendium of the sort of language we enjoyed for seven seasons of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQ68RI">Buffy The Vampire Slayer</a>," but that does not do Cody's dialogue justice.  The last time I heard dialogue that made me set up and take notice it was probably Quentin Tarentino's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000068DBC">Pulp Fiction</a>," but that was diction and timing rather than word choices.  Probably the closest comparison is between "Juno" and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJ48T0">A Clockwork Orange</a>," and that still does not do justice to the delightful verbiage that comes out of the mouths of these characters.<br /><br />The performance from the ensemble is stellar.  Those who have been debating whether Dakota Fanning or Evan Rachel Wood is the best actress under 21 are going to have to include Ellen Page in the debate.  I recognized her from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HCO83Q">X-Men - The Last Stand</a>" and Michael Cera from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WZEZGI">Superbad</a>," but clearly these roles go to the top of their resumes.  I know there is a bandwagon for Page for an Oscar nomination, but Janney and Simmons should be touted for their superb supporting roles as well.  "Juno" is the best thing that Jason Bateman has ever done and he is probably the biggest surprise here, although when Jennifer Garner's name came up in the opening credits I wondered what she was doing in this film, but seeing as how Bateman and Garner made "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y7WGOW">The Kingdom</a> together immediately before filming their roles in "Juno," I suspect that might be the connection.  I have to think that everybody who read this script, from director Jason Reitman ("<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0MKOC">Thank You for Smoking</a>") to the entire cast immediately signup for the joy of making this film.<br /><br />The one thing to be aware of is that you should stay for the end credits just to check out the songs that are in this movie, although once the Antsy Pants start playing "Vampire" you should want to stick around.  Be forewarned that "Juno" is one of those movies where you are going to want to get the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00104W8T6">soundtrack</a> on the way home from the theater (or, um, download it as soon as you get home).  The songs done for the movie are by Kimya Dawson, who is a perfect fit for Cody's screenplay, because she seems to be channeling Gilbert & Sullivan through postmodernist sensibilities.  But the great thing about the soundtrack is that all of the key songs that either play in the background or are actually played by (or sung by) the characters in the film are on the CD.  I should also mention that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1557048029">shooting script</a> is out there as well, if you want to read over the choice dialogue again while listening to the eclectic mix of songs on the soundtrack (while waiting for the movie to come out on DVD).</p></body></html>

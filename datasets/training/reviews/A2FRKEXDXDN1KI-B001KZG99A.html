<meta name="summary" content="A cool DVD...but if you want 5-stars...go for the two-disc or Blu-ray version!"></head><body><p>I've been a big fan of the Iron Man comic book series for such a long time and from the "Tales of Suspense" comic books, as a young child, I would always be into the "Avengers" and even be this happy child with his "Secret Wars" Iron Man toy.<br /><br />Years before "IRON MAN" became a movie, I've always pictured Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man.  He had the look and even back then with Downey Jr.'s personal life, there is some instances that mirror Tony Stark's challenges in the comic books.  So, suffice to say that I was quite happy with him being cast for the film.<br /><br />As for the the film, I had no doubt in my mind that "IRON MAN" would be a blockbuster hit in the Summer but I purposely waited for it to come out on DVD, so I can watch it on my own personal home theater and watch it with no distractions.<br /><br />This film focuses on Tony Stark, the millionaire who runs Stark Industries which creates weapons for the military but while on a meeting to the Middle East, Stark's military escort are gun down and eventually the suave millionaire gets caught in a blast (from weapons created by his company), next thing you know, Stark is being operated on and being held by prisoner by terrorists.<br /><br />While under captivity, Stark creates his first Iron Man uniform and uses it to escape his captors.  Upon returning back to America, Stark's perspective of the world and his company has changed.  Also, his goal to develop a more technologically advanced mobile suit armor becomes his obsession and leads him to take on the terrorist who have been using his companies weapons for evil but most of all prepare for the lies and deceptions that await him.<br /><br />AUDIO & VIDEO:<br /><br />The version that I am reviewing is the regular widescreen DVD, not the awesome Blu-ray version packed with a lot of extras.  But the audio for this version is Dolby Digital 5.1 and video is widescreen enhanced for 16:9 TV's.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />This "IRON MAN" DVD version features deleted and extended scenes.  Deleted scenes that I'm glad the director chose to eliminate from the final cut of the film.<br /><br />There are three versions of this release on DVD/Blu-Ray.  This version is the single disc version, the double disc version features many featurettes including a 108-minute documentary, a six part documentary and more.  The Blu-ray version has received almost perfect stars for its amount of content and BD-Live.  So, if you have a Blu-ray player, the Blu-ray version of "IRON MAN" is what is recommended.<br /><br />After watching it, I definitely enjoyed the film but like any superhero film, as the first film always focuses on the origin, this series will be judged on its continuing storylines.  Similar to like the "X-Men", "Spider-Man" and the "Fantastic Four" films, there is always the "origin" that not many people are too enthusiastic about and want to see more battles.<br /><br />Fortunately, "Iron Man"did offer quite a bit of kick as battles but I loved the scene where Iron Man just rescues a village being terrorized by the enemies.<br /><br />Again, Robert Downey Jr. did a great job as Tony Star, Jeff Bridges as Obidiah Stane was pretty good.  As for Terrence Howard's James Rhodes... it was OK but I was expecting more of a no-nonsense Rhodes.  But with Don Cheadle replacing Howard for the next film, I hope that Cheadle can bring the attitude especially if he's going to be War Machine.<br /><br />But definitely enjoyed this film.  With "IRON MAN", unlike any other top tier Marvel superheroes, Robert Downey Jr. has a lot of inner demons to contend with and is such a complex character.  For the comic series, the alcoholism consumed him and I'm curious to see if it happens in the films.  It will definitely be interesting to see how his character is explored and what new Iron Man outfit we will see him sporting next Silver Centurion Iron Man?  Maybe even see some Hulkbuster or Thorbuster?  Who knows.  And of course, there is James Rhodes as War Machine and I look forward in seeing that character come to play in the films.<br /><br />But all in all, "IRON MAN" was an enjoyable film for the first version.  A lot of action, special effects but definitely would like to see where they go with the characters in the next upcoming film.<br /><br />All in all, a very cool movie and enjoyed it so much, now I'm going to have to pick up the Blu-ray ultimate edition next!</p></body></html>

While these stories are not faithful adaptations of Robert Ludlum's novels they do capture the essence of the novels - the idea of this former CIA mercenary who only wants to live a normal life, but can't seem to escape the clutches of a government that wants to kill him, or use him if they can.  What the creators of these films do is re-imagine the stories in modern times using modern-age enemies to face Bourne.  Matt Damon has really wrapped himself around the essence of the character and at times has some real moments of drama that you don't normally see in action movies of this type.  Damon is also surrounded by a great supporting cast.  Brian Cox and Julia Stiles are back and do a fantastic job.  This time around we also have Joan Allen as an embattled CIA operative who only wants to do the right thing while being thwarted at every turn by rogue agents.  Karl Urban is great as Jason Bourne's nemesis and a worthy adversary as Bourne's Russian counterpart.  I was riveted from the first minute and anyone who enjoys well-written and well-acted action films will be, as well.</p></body></html>

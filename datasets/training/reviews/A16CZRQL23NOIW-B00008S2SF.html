The script inside what Bond terminology represents has to do with the real menace that represents North Korea inside the geopolitical map.<br /><br />This inner conflicts are far to be resolved, there are many involved and mingled issues to be discussed here. But this is the departure' s point to establish the rules of the game, in which hidden foreigner interests will be in struggle.<br /><br />The visual feast will load the screen with impressive sequences of high caliber tension; the imaginative audacious, the fabulous special effects become a true parade of technological exhibition. And the brilliant inclusion of Halle Berry adds a major quote of dazzling talent and beauty.

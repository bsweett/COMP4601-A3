Will Smith plays the detective to link this confusion together.<br />I had never thought about seeing this movie because I'm not into science fiction, but I do like Will Smith. This movie had some clever lines, interesting characters, and even the robots were entertaining. I loved seeing the futuristic cars (with no gas, I wonder what their running prices are?), trains, gadgets, etc. The only problem I found with this movie is that Will Smith should've died a half hour into the movie but somehow kept living through train crashes, robot attacks, water, etc. And what ever happened to the cat in the trunk?</p></body></html>

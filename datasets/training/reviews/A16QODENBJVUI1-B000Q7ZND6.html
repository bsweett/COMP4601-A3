<meta name="summary" content="A bit better than many of the reviews here would indicate"></head><body><p>First, let me encourage anyone seeing this film to stay until the very end of the closing credits.  Yes, there is a bit of an add on at the very tail.  Walk out early and you'll miss it.<br /><br />I have to start off by confessing that I have never read any of the Hellrazer comics, so I had no prior expectations going into this film.  My experience of the film, therefore, will necessarily be different from those who had contesting conceptions of John Constantine.  All in all, I very much enjoyed this movie, though with a couple of major reservations.<br /><br />First, the good.  This is a great looking film, with a host of superb special effects and sets.  The Los Angeles of the film is very much the same Los Angeles of TV's ANGEL, dark, dingy, inelegant, the antithesis of the L.A. of Randy Newman's video "I Love L.A."  I liked the basic premise of the film:  John Constantine is an exorcist who is damned because he killed himself when younger before being resuscitated two minutes later, but enough in Catholic theology to make him permanently damned.  Again, parallels with TV's ANGEL, where the hero has committed unspeakable crimes, has become an irretrievably damned vampire, and yet as a vampire with a soul has regained a conscience and strives to balance out the evil he has brought into the world.  Fans of the comics will point out that the comic preceded the TV show, but I will point out two things.  First, it is entirely possible that the comic had some influence on the show (creator Joss Whedon is an avid comics fan).  Second, the TV show could have exerted influence on the movie (in literary circles it is not uncommon to read articles like "W. B. Yeats influence on Blake," the idea being that the later poet, by appropriating and reinterpreting aspects of the earlier poet's work, influences the way that their work continues to be perceived).  I think the parallels will be obvious and difficult to ignore for anyone familiar with the TV show and watching the movie with or without prior knowledge of the comic.  Another great positive in the movie is the wonderful presence of Rachel Weisz, a beautiful and talented actress who brings far more ability to the role than is required by the genre.  Peter Stomare also has an interesting turn as Lucifer.  Most of the cast, in fact, is excellent.  The story was interesting as well.  In fact, one of the big problems I have with movies that depart from reality is that usually the premises of the film fall apart within only a few seconds thought.  Take THE ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND.  An interesting film, but if you think about the central premise, the absurdity of it becomes blatant almost immediately, quite apart from whether it is possible.  The very notion that memories can be isolated from all of their social connections is silly in the extreme (and in that movie, the Kate Winslet character, sans memories, goes to the apartment building of her former boyfriend, only to be recognized and addressed by someone who still possessed all of his memories-in other words, you can't erase memories not simply because it isn't physiologically possible, but it isn't sociologically possible).  But CONSTANTINE, while if you pushed it really hard might not hold up, nonetheless holds up if you push it only a little bit, which is much better than most other films in the genre.  From beginning to end, it was an enjoyable story.<br /><br />Now the bad.  First and foremost there is Keanu Reeves, one of the great mysteries of the cinema.  He is relatively likable, and definitely attractive, but he is without any possible doubt one of the least talented leading actors in the history of the movies.  He is profoundly inept at delivering lines, and lacking in the powerful screen presence that some other untalented leading actors possess.  For instance, John Wayne was not a great thespian, but he had an overwhelming presence onscreen that more than made up for a lack of acting ability.  Many actors bring more to a role than they find on a page.  Reeves leaves on the page much that he should have incarnated in his performance.  His wooden delivery of lines is astonishing for its sheer awfulness.  I'm baffled as to why he was cast in the role.  Perhaps others turned it down, but I kept wondering what the movie would have been like with a Hugh Jackman or Jeremy Northram or Christian Bale would have been like.  Or even a good actor who isn't quite right for the role, but has considerable ability, like Edward Norton.  Or even Mark Wahlberg.  I will say this:  this is at least a better movie than the last two MATRIX movies, though I'm not sure that Reeves can be given any of the credit.  Far an away, Reeves is the single biggest thing wrong with this film.  I was also very disappointed with the film's use of Tilda Swinton, whom I have long considered one of the most underutilized actresses in film.  As the mildly androgynous Gabriel (I wonder if her role in ORLANDO put the casting director in mind of her) she is uncharacteristically awful.  Not to worry though, she will be back later in the year in the plumy role of Jadis the White Witch in THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, the top fantasy film of the year.<br /><br />Also like ANGEL, the movie is stuffed with utterly awful theology.  On the TV show, I was as someone trained in philosophy utterly appalled at the Buffyverse idea of a detachable soul as well as other randomly utilized theological ideas.  In CONSTANTINE, there is some adherence to traditional Catholic theology, especially in regard to suicide, but much of the rest of the film embraces some of the most condemned heresies in church history.  In particular, the film depends on a na?ve Manichaeism which depends on a dualistic vision of the universe as divided between God and Devil, whereas Christianity whether Catholic or Protestant is nondualistic, evil being conceived not as an entity actual in itself, but negatively as being the absence of God.  (BUFFY and ANGEL suffer from the same Manichaeism).  What I find troubling about this is the randomness of the world view in play.  The creators pick and choose among the ideas that they need, and in the end the film suffers as a result.  All films involve some decisions about the kind of world in which the film will take place.  I'm just bothered when the creation of that world is especially arbitrary.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed this film, and while I can understand the criticisms of it by those who come to it from the comics, I think that many of those who are unfamiliar with it will probably enjoy it.</p></body></html>

I mean, seriously, even if you have yet to see the movie I'm sure you could sing that song word for word right now.<br /><br />Go ahead; I'll wait.<br /><br />The thing is that I too had never seen this movie yet knew all those words and it made me question just why it was that I never sat down to watch this beloved musical.  I am not really a huge musical lover, but then again, I've never been one to disregard a movie because of genre before.  I'll watch anything at least once.  So, when this came on TCM a few months ago I just had to watch it.  I got everything ready for `movie night' (the drinks, the friends, the snacks) and I settled in to watch what has steadily been considered one of the top ten movies of all time.<br /><br />I loved it!<br /><br />Everything about this movie fits so perfectly into one another.  The music is divine, the performances are stellar, the set pieces are delicious and the script is fun, fresh and wholly entertaining.  There is not a single misstep here.  It's not the best movie of all time, but it works magic with every fiber of its being.<br /><br />The film tells of film star Don Lockwood as he struggles to transition himself from `silent' film star to `talkie' film star.  His frequent costar and rumored lover Lina Lamont is a selfish and spoiled diva whose voice is just not suited for film, so a young and talented singer named Kathy Selden is hired to dub her voice for their upcoming film.  When Don falls in love with Kathy things get out of hand.  Lina is furious and it becomes apparent that their love affair could sink the whole picture.<br /><br />Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor make a wonderful team here, feeding off each others energy to create some of the most impressive and widely acclaimed dance numbers in musical history.  Solo they are spectacular, but together they are even better; and what is so awesome is that when Debbie Reynolds (who is so refreshingly spunky here) jumps in she makes the perfect pair into a vibrant threesome.  The real scene stealer though is Jean Hagen.  She may not sing or dance but she acts her tail off, delivering an iconic comedic performance that will have you rolling in your seats.<br /><br />I haven't had this much fun watching a movie in a long time (I tend to prefer the dramatic and depressing films, so this was a nice change of pace).  I've since seen the film again and loved it just as much if not more the second time around.  This is a film designed to make you smile, and is succeeds at doing just that.</p></body></html>

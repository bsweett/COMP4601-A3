<meta name="summary" content="A Magical Movie For Me and You!"></head><body><p>CHOCOLAT is a movie that warms the heart. It has a mystical feeling about it that is generated by the incredible performance of Juliette Binoche (Wuthering Heights, Blue) and the fictional village where her character creates a chocolate shop of magic in a small European town.<p>It has warmth about the relationship of a strained mother and daughter who spend their time moving from town to town trying to set up shop. A Chocolate shop it was directed by Lasse Hallstrom (The Shipping News, The Cider House Rules) who masterfully makes you, the audience, a part of this film. From the evil towns would be "Mayor" to the towns very own "Mistress" - it has something for everyone to talk about.<p>This film is soft to the touch and has an incredible amount of humor in it. Including the concept that chocolate is an aphrodisiac. They play that to the hilt. Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hallow) plays the love interest who is the stranger from out of town who is also the bad boy. There is a woman in the story cleverly played by Judy Dench (Shakespeare In Love, Elizabeth, the 4 James Bond movies) who is old and doing everything she isn't supposed and teaches the lessons of life, love and enjoying yourself. It comes at a high price for her in the end.<p>The story is fun energetic and it is photographed extremely well. It was a charm about it that makes you want chocolate but more, importantly, want to enjoy it to its fullest. The DVD extras include a really good commentary and real detailed documentary on making this fictional town seem very real. This is a good film for the whole family. It has a good simple story and a lot of passion. Just a good feeling type of film...</p></body></html>

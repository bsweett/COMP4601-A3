<meta name="summary" content="An Extraordinary Adventure."></head><body><p>_The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_ is a decent action/adventure movie which features a confrontation at the end of the Nineteenth Century between the forces of good represented by various characters from Nineteenth Century classics and the forces of evil represented by an evil professor turned British agent.  The movie attempts to show how secret forces operated behind the creation of the Twentieth Century and the world wars during that century.  At the end of the movie, the character representing the British empire played by Sean Connery, Alan Quartermain, remarks that as the Nineteenth Century belonged to him so the Twentieth will belong to the young American boy, &quot;Sawyer&quot;.  Thus, we see how the British empire has faded and the rise of the American superpower brought about through the First and Second World Wars.  The movie unfortunately isn't able to fully show the detail of this interpretation.  I enjoyed this movie and it raised for me many questions about the role of secret forces influencing the birth of the Twentieth Century.  When the League is initiated we see a masonic symbol on the door to the hall where the League has its first meeting.  Perhaps this indicates that the masonic societies have played a role in initiating wars and revolutions.  Now, that the ultra-violent Twentieth Century has come to pass and man faces a new millenium one can only begin to ask what the future will bring.</p></body></html>

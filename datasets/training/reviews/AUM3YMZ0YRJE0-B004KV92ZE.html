<meta name="summary" content="slapstick wisdom that even my wife could enjoy"></head><body><p>This is a kids' film, with rather grotesque vaudeville antics, cheesy life lessons, and an impossible plot.  Nonetheless, there is absolutely no question that this works.  From the first image of the buffoon Panda, I knew intuitively that I would enjoy this film in the way that a child's mind can:  suspending my disbelief and surrendering myself to the experience, no matter how ridiculous.<br /><br />Even though it checks all of the boxes:  ancient riddle wisdom, action acrobatics that are as mesmerizing as they are impossible, a deadly adversary that only the best can face, the destiny of dreams, and a training program for novices that transforms their lives both inside and outside.  Of course, there is the plucky neophyte, a most unlikely choice to join the greatest of warriors.  What's more, the established cadre does not want to accept the master's choice of the Panda, taking on a mission to reject and undermine him physically and psychologically.<br /><br />The uberbad guy escapes and comes to claim his mantle as master.  Meanwhile, the Panda takes his training in spite of the challenges, proving his character for the coming battle.  The process is fun to watch and you believe it.  The buildup in tension is good and there is plenty of comic relief, even in decisive battles.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  This is great family entertainment.</p></body></html>

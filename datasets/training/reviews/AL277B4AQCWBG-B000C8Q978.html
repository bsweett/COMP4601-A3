<meta name="summary" content="Strong performances, but pace may frustrate"></head><body><p>When Don Johnston (Bill Murray) is dumped by his latest lover, Sherry (Julie Delpy), he resigns himself to being alone yet again. Then he receives a mysterious pink letter from an anonymous former lover who informs him that he has a 19-year-old son, who may now be looking for his father. Prompted by his neighbour Winston (Jeffrey Wright) who has a penchant for unsolved mysteries and has tracked down the names and addresses of four possible mothers from Don's long list of ex-girlfriends, Don reluctantly begins a journey to visit each of them and try to figure it all out... Great setup. You think you know where this is going - aging Lothario revisits the past and learns something about himself - and are even looking forward to the journey. The problem here is that Jarmusch does very little with it and does it so tediously that most audiences are likely to be more frustrated than engaged. The pacing is truly mind-numbing. So much of the running time is consumed by repetitive transitional sequences, most of which add absolutly nothing to the story or character, nor anything more to the atmosphere than what was established by the opening scenes, that they seem little more than excuses to hear the soundtrack. They're used to such an extent that they infect the entire film with an artistically unnecessary lugubrious tone. Thankfully, the performances compensate. The ex-girlfriends - Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange and Tilda Swinton - are all excellent, doing wonders with very little screen time. Much has been made of Murray's minimalist style. It works, to an extent. Although it does make you wonder how such a stick-in-the-mud ever managed to attract such a coterie of women, or what he used to be like and what hideous event changed him. But we never find out. We never find out much of anything in this film. In the final moments, all we are left with is a banal regurgitation of Buddhist philosophy - a philosophy of the Eternal Now that Don, by the way, seemed to be living quite perfectly when he was sitting alone in his living room, doing nothing, being present, in the semi-dark. Arguably, the (non)resolution of this (non)story is realistic in the extreme, but it's a very unsatisfying ending. This may well be what Jarmusch intended: the answer to our future doesn't lie in nostalgia for an unrecoverable, impenetrable past; and the magic is in the silences, in the unsaid. Fair enough points. But they don't make for a very good movie. "Broken Flowers" is quite enjoyable on one level, but not the deeply satisfying film you might have expected. Think of it as "About Schmidt" or "Sideways" or "Lost in Translation", but without the growth. Or the hope. Or most of the laughs. Which doesn't leave much to enjoy.</p></body></html>

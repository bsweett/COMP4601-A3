Dracula walking on walls was a good one, as were the transformations and the CG harpies.<br /><br />I think the women's costumes count as special effects, too. Anna's exaggerated hour-glass figure says a lot about Kate Beckinsale's ability to endure a corset. Also, her blouse managed to cover her quite properly and still convey the idea of not being there - that was pretty special. I think some strategically placed pink pectoral patches enhanced that illusion. Those brides of Dracula had some very special effects in their bodices as well. (BTW, after seeing where the spawn of Dracula comes from, I really don't want to know much about their home life.)<br /><br />Plot? I guess there might have been one. Sort of. The lead character, Van Helsing, goes around shooting bad guys with a sort of crossbow/Gatling gun kind of thing. I suppose I could say more, but it still wouldn't add up to real story line.<br /><br />It's an exciting movie in a bland sort of way. You could do worse - but you might have to try.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

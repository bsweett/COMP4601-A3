After viewing the film like alot of the excellent films I seen I strongly disagree with the director's attitude on the film being unfinished. I think whoever edited this piece knew what an audience would associate most with the characters and made the film successful. If you are into movies where people go against the grain and lose all their connections in order to make things a little better then this movie displays it with tremendous and powerful emotion</p></body></html>

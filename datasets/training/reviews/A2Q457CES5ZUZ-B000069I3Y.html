<meta name="summary" content="A Film With a Positive Message"></head><body><p>Director Roger Michell scored big with "Notting Hill," a feel good movie about love in which the unlikely pairing of film superstar Julia Roberts and impoverished book store proprietor Hugh Grant resulted in gloriously unselfish love.  "Changing Lanes" is a drama about greed tugging at the soul of society and how one young man responds, producing another feel good movie of sorts by the film's finale.<p>Ben Affleck is a "What Makes Sammy Run?" style lawyer from New York who at the tender age of 29 has already made it to partner level in the highly successful firm run by his father-in-law, played by prominent director and talented character actor Sydney Pollack.  On his way to court and an important probate hearing for control of the foundation previously headed by a now deceased, wealthy entrepreneur-philanthropist, the young man in a hurry becomes involved in a fender bender with Samuel L. Jackson.<p>The fender bender has a major impact on both drivers.  Jackson, an insurance salesman fighting a battle against alcohol addiction, misses a crucial custody hearing involving his wife and children.  His wife is slated to move to Oregon and seeks to take Jackson's children with her while, through great effort, he has managed to string together a deal for a fixer-upper house, hoping this will keep her in New York and prompt her to drop her divorce action against him.  The accident makes him late for the hearing as full custody is granted to his wife.  He does not get to make his case.<p>Affleck suffers in a different way.  In the mixup following the accident Affleck leaves behind the all-important file containing the signature of the dying philanthropist granting the law firm for which the young lawyer works total control of the foundation's money.  This crucial document ends up in Jackson's hands.<p>When Affleck through happenstance manages to see Jackson on the street and seeks help, the angry insurance salesman lets him know what he thinks of his discourtesy and indifference to his plight, reminding him that he fled the scene of the accident.  When Affleck plays hardball and has Jackson's credit ruined through employing a skilled Internet hacker, his tough adversary fights back on his own terms.<p>After the action has escalated to an accelerated level the two adversaries develop a respect for each other and begin to recognize that in such a situation an ethical solution is the best course for both of them.  <p>Affleck grows up in a hurry, facing the blunt truth that in securing the signature of a dying man no longer in control of his faculties he has engaged in fraud on behalf of the firm.  When he expresses his misgivings to Pollack, he is bluntly told to wise up and do his job.  Pollack states that the philanthropist used some shady methods to acquire his fortune, and that is the way the game is played in the corporate and professional big leagues, in a take no prisoners manner with moral qualms left behind.  To do less is to lose the race.<p>At the film's end Affleck is a changed man who is able to turn the tables on Pollack in a clever manner.  He will no longer be a hired gun who abandons ethical considerations in the pursuit of more money and fame.</p></body></html>

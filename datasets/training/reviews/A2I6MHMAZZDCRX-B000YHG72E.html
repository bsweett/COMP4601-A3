<meta name="summary" content="Promising Beginning; Good Ending.  What Happened in the Middle?"></head><body><p>Buddy (Will Ferrell) has been raised at the North Pole.  Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) is very proud of his adopted son.  There's just one problem, Buddy is a human, not an elf.  In addition to his enormous size, he doesn't have the talents for toy making that all his friends do.<br /><br />When Buddy learns the truth, he sets out for New York to meet Walter (James Caan), his real father.  Walter works for a children's book publisher, but his ideas aren't selling.  He's also on Santa's (Edward Asner) naughty list.  And Walter isn't thrilled to discover he has an adult son, especially one who insists on dressing like an elf all the time.  Will he ever accept Buddy?  Will Buddy ever fit in New York?<br /><br />I avoided this movie because I'm not a big Will Ferrell fan.  This movie didn't exactly change my mind, but it wasn't as bad as I had feared.  In fact, it started out very cute and charming with several great laughs.  Then, Buddy moves to New York and things go downhill.  I'm not a big fan of embarrassment humor, and that's pretty much what happens as we watch Buddy making a fool out of himself time and time again.  I was cringing instead of laughing.<br /><br />Something happened, however, as we reached the climax.  While it was completely predictable, I found myself caught up in it.  And I found I cared for the characters.  I wanted to see them all happy.  Unfortunately, it did feel a little force, like it didn't quite follow from what came before.  But at the time I didn't care.<br /><br />This isn't the Christmas classic it wants to be.  It isn't a bad movie, but there are movies that are better.</p></body></html>

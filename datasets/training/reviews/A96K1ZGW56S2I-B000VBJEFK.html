<meta name="summary" content="This Rat Smells Like Fine Food."></head><body><p>RATATOUILLE is a Pixar picture.  That's all that one needs to know.  However, if you want some details about the film and some other (though highly unnecessary) reasons to watch the movie, keep reading.<br /><br />RATATOUILLE is a story about a French country bumpkin, named Remy (Patton Oswalt) who discovers that he not only has a nose and taste for fine food, but that he can cook great meals as well.  The only problem is that Remy is a rat.  Most people don't even like rats and since they carry and spread more diseases than almost any other animal in the world, it's not usually healthy to have one near a kitchen.  Remy finds himself literally swept away from the country to the streets of Paris.  He sneaks into the restaurant that is named and was once owned by a famous cook who Remy used to watch on tv and who believed that "anyone can cook".  Of course, no one actually believes that and after being caught, the kitchen's new scullery boy, Linguini (Lou Romano), is sent to drown Remy in the river.  Of course, Linguini can't bring himself to do it and when realizing that Remy can understand him and that he can cook, too, he brings Remy home.  A partnership is formed and the duo soon become the talk of Paris.  But the current chef and owner of the restaurant hates Linguini and smells a rat.  He tries to find out if there's someway he can keep the shining star from rising any higher, but his plans are nothing compared to the trouble that a deepening relationship between a rat and a man and the kindness that a rat shows towards his family.<br /><br />The film was written and co-directed by Brad Bird, a former animator of THE SIMPSONS and the guy who wrote and directed THE INCREDIBLES.<br /><br />You really shouldn't need any more reasons to see this movie, but I'll give you some more.  The film is mostly set in Paris and RATATOUILLE presents some of the most authentic animation of Paris ever seen on film.  If you've never been to Paris, you'll actually come away with a feel for the city after seeing the movie.  I know because I've never been to Paris and after the film some friends I know who have been there said, "Now you have an idea of what Paris is like."  Besides Patton Oswalt and Lou Romano, the movie also features the vocal talents of Ian Holm, Brian Dennehy, Peter O'Toole, Brad Garrett, Janeane Garofalo, Will Arnett, and John Ratzenberger.<br /><br />Lastly, the other reason you should see RATATOUILLE is for the water animation sequence.  Remy is separated from his family and taken to Paris by the waterways in the streams and sewers that run from the countryside into the city.  I knew I was watching a cartoon during this sequence.  I kept telling myself that over and over and over. "This is animation."  The reason I did that is because the water looks so real.  It looked so real that there were times that it literally looks as if it is splashing off the screen.  Even if this wasn't a Pixar picture or had any of the other fine things going for it, RATATOUILLE would be worth seeing for that one sequence alone.<br /><br />Toddlers and younger kids will probably be enthralled with the colors.  Older children will probably love the physical comedy.  Adults will enjoy the story and the few allusions laid out for them throughout the picture.  RATATOUILLE truly is a picture for the whole family to enjoy and one of the best, if not the best animated film of 2007.</p></body></html>

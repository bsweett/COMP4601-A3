<meta name="summary" content="Quite an original story"></head><body><p>Briony, a 13 year old girl, was in love with her family's servant Robbie before she makes a false statement against him accusing him of rape of her friend, after she finds out he and her older sister Cee are in love. He gets sent to jail then later joins the army. Her sister abandons her family, abandons Briony, and lives alone in London. She stays in touch with Robbie over letters, hoping he will return to her safely from war one day and live with her happy ever after. Briony feels guilty and tries to contact her sister to apologize and confess her mistake.<br /><br />Robbie dies before he was scheduled to return home. Her sister dies in a tunnel she was hiding that got destroyed during the war. Briony feels immensely guilty because she feels that she was the one that prevented their deserved love. She then decides to write a book to tell everyone the truth about her sister and Robbie, confess her lie, and give them an imagined happy ending. The book is called "Atonement".<br /><br />Excellent story! Great acting! Wonderful sound track!<br /><br />This movie made me think, most people think love should result in goodness and happiness, but couldn't it also produce hatred and pain. Is that why they say "Love Hurts"? Briony's early love of Robbie made him and her sister suffer and live miserably till they died. Isn't that many times the case?</p></body></html>

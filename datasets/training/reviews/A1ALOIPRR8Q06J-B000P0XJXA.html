Enough said.<br /><br />Well I'll ramble on for a moment here because I do like this movie.<br /><br />If this flick was supposed to be based on real events -or "real events", or had a message, or was popular with rightwingers, or--God spare us--moronically depicted torture as a vital and reliable way to gather informationa and save countless lives from immanent doom--then it would suck in my book. I have very mixed feelings, you might say, on movies depicting the military and spies and lots of the stuff that goes with that like murdering people. But just like any red blooded male and American the dark and  unsurprising truth is I love watching violence with guns and explosions and bad a** alpha-males doing the impossible. (I don't remember explosions in this one though.)<br /><br />Basically SPARTAN can be viewed as a kind of cinematic version of the TV series "24".<br /><br />Val Kilmer is excellent in this role as a sort of Delta Force type commando or super-elite agent. It has the guy who was in TV's "Married with Children" playing head of the FBI or something and he is fantastic. You wouldn't believe how real he is as a take charge alpha-male head of a huge and powerful governmental agency. Everybody is good.<br /><br />As far as the plot goes, basically the president's daughter is missing and it ain't clear where she is because she is missing and of course you don't know who has her or why. And you also don't know what some people that you'd think don't know anything actually do or who is up to what or why. A web of decite and misinformation and so on. Who's playin' and who's getting played? Bottom line, what's special about this stylish David Mamet tale is, of course, the dialog. It can be over-the-top at times as is sometimes the case with his stuff, but it's still great and I like how it's laid on thick. And Val Kilmer is the man.<br /><br />I highly recommend SPARTAN and all David Mamet movies.</p></body></html>

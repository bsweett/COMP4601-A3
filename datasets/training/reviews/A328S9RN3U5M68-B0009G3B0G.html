<meta name="summary" content="A Mixed Bag of Stories Glued Together by Brody's Galvanizing Performance"></head><body><p>THE JACKET is a tough film to categorize much less to get your mind around.  It is as though writers Tom Bleeker and Marc Rocco had a wealth of thoughts for a story that includes near-death experiences, mind manipulation, time travel, and messianic ideals and tried to weld them all together in a script for John Maybury to manipulate and direct.  The result is a weird mishmash of a film that has some terrific moments sparkling in the meandering mess of a plot.  The film would be a loss were it not for the inestimable talents of Adrien Brody who somehow makes it all fit together!<br /><br />Jack Starks (Brody) is first seen in 1991 in the Gulf War where he approaches a small boy who shoots him in the head.  Mistakenly taken for dead, Starks shows a bit of life in the triage facility and is shipped back to Vermont to recover.  After release from the hospital Starks is walking the roads in the snow, befriends a child Jackie (Laura Marano) who stands by her stalled car while her mother Jean (Kelly Preston) sits on the roadside vomiting from wither pill or alcohol abuse.  Starks gets the car started, tends to Jean who reacts violently and tells him to get out.  Starks continues to hitchhike, is picked up by a stranger (Brad Renfro) and when the car is stopped by a highway patrol, the stranger kills the policeman and Starks ends up being arrested for the crime.<br /><br />In court he is sent to a mental hospital for the criminally insane, falls into the hands of a strange Dr. Becker (Kris Kristofferson) who attempts mind control experiments on him, placing him in a straight jacket then sliding him into a morgue slot for unconscionable isolation. The attempts to alter Starks 'perverse sense of violence' result in hours of isolation when flashbacks occur; these flashbacks ultimately result in flash forwards.  Without meaningful editing we see Starks unchanged in the year 2007 where he encounters the mature Jackie (Keira Knightley), a drunk whose mother Jean is dead from burning from falling asleep with a lighted cigarette.  With some manipulation Starks gradually convinces Jackie he is the one who saved her in 1993 and the two try to figure out (along with us, the viewers!) just what happened.<br /><br />At this point we have few clues as to the difference between 1993 and 2007 except those provided by the good Dr. Lorenson (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and by some input from one of the more talkative patients in the mental hospital - Rudy Mackenzie (Daniel Craig).  The tale becomes more intricately twisted until at last we see the point of all the threads tie together as Starks is able to share his futuristic visions with Jackie in order to prevent occurrences less than desirable.<br /><br />If you can follow that synopsis (probably just one version as seen by one viewer!) then you have an idea how much you have to work to make this film come together.  Why there are so many big name stars (Leigh, Craig, Kristofferson, Renfro, Lynch, etc) in throwaway cameos is puzzling.  But even with heavy handed special effects, wild camera work, and insecure direction, Adrien Brody makes the film worth watching. He continues to take on roles that are challenging and on the edge - and he does them very well!  An interesting diversion of a film for those fans of Brody who also have adequate patience.

<meta name="summary" content="Pixar does it again"></head><body><p>I've come to really like Pixar productions.  Good movies, good story lines and just enough underlying adult humor to keep the parents engaged.  This story is cute, one that I'm sure will be a hit with the little ones.  Great animation, big star voices and a good story line that offers some life lessons.  One to add to the library.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Revenge is a Dish Best Served Cold"></head><body><p>The Good Things<br />*Excellent action and some gorgeous special effects (including a very early example of CGI effects).<br />*Filming style is great and very original.<br />*Production design is a vast improvement over the first "Star Trek" film.<br />*Sound design is splendid too.<br />*The storyline is great.  It takes after the episode "Space Seed" in the original series, but it's not entirely necessary to watch it in order to understand the movie.<br />*The characters are awesome.  Kahn (Ricardo Montalban) is one of the best bad guys ever, and his performance is so dramatic.  Kirk is very compassionate.  Everybody else is good; great acting.<br />*Good writing.  Lots of memorable lines.<br />*Strong themes about life and death, birth and rebirth, and growing old.<br />*Good music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*A few bloody bits (mostly involving alien bugs that burrow into people's ears); probably not for young kids or the extremely squeamish.<br /><br />Definately the best of the "Star Trek" film saga.  It does away with the dull space-opera elements of the first film and provides a smashing extravaganza of space battles, epic story-telling, and intense character conflicts.  The writing is totally awesome, and presents loads of great lines and dramatic acting.  It's a classic in every sense.<br /><br />The original one-disc release has okay video and sound quality, and includes a trailer.  The newer two-disc set has good quality and sound, and a bunch of fascinating featurettes and trailers.</p></body></html>

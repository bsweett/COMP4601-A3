Why are Frank Capra's films so universal and timeless, especially this one? Well, watch it and find out.<br /><br />The story concerns George Bailey (James Stewart), a guy from a small town that everyone knows and loves. As a boy he worked in a drugstore, his father at a savings and loan bank, and when his father died, he took over, despite aching to see the world and go to college. He did his duty but found happiness in a girl in town, Mary (Donna Reed) who became his wife. However, through the storybook life, there was a sense of longing for childhood dreams and a feeling of emptiness in George. This only manifested itself when Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), the local rich curmudgeon with selfish ambition, antagonized George. Finally, at a turning point in his life, George is faced with failure and faces an angel named Clarence (Henry Travers) whose purpose is to pull George back from the precipice of suicide.<br /><br />It is difficult not to get wrapped up in such a story. You don't have to be from a small town, you don't have to be married, and you don't have to be middle aged to understand this movie and to love it. The themes and the sentiments are universal. Everyone likes to feel they are basically good and that the forces against them are evil; that is what this story is about, good trying to win over evil. Such a basic idea is enhanced by wonderful camerawork, brilliant acting, and amazing directing done in the golden age of Hollywood.<br /><br />This is no Christmas story, so do not hesitate to watch it any day of the year. The uplifting tone is often associated with an allotted time for giving each year, but it is appropriate for any time. Perhaps that is what we all need.</p></body></html>

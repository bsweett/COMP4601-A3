<meta name="summary" content="An Exciting Fantasy World That's Loaded With Adventure"></head><body><p>Drawing on the huge popularity of 1950's science fiction and comics,  "Sky Captain" takes the viewer on an exciting journey complete with giant robots and a P-40 fighter that doubles as a submarine.<br /><br />The movie is set in the time period between World war I and World War II.  Reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) gets wind of a world takeover scheme by a mad German sceintist named Totenkopf.  Soon, New York City is being attacked by giant flying robots and other flying machines who are trying to steal the city's power generators.  Desperate, Polly calls on ex-boyfriend Joseph "Sky Captain" Sullivan for help.  He arrives just in time in his P-40 fighter plane and helps drive the robots off.  However, Joe's buddy Dex (Giovanni Ribini) believes that he can track the origin of the robots using radio waves.  After several attempts, he manages to track their base of origin to Nepal. So, Joe, Polly, Dex, and Franky Cook (Angelina Jolie), another of Joe's ex girlfriends and commander of a squadron of flying British aircraft carriers, set off to foil Totenkopf's plan, while braving more encounters with the robots and other mechanical enemies.<br /><br />The setting for the movie is something driectly out of a 1950's sci-fi film, complete with the giant, poldding robots, as well as a deviant scientist trying to take over the world.  The computer animation and special effects are very good.  I especially liked Jolie's force of flying aircraft carriers.  As for the story itself, I had a little problem following some parts of the movie, but overall, I thought the story was very well-conceived.  The acting by Jude Law and Giovanni Ribini is very good, but I thought Gwyneth Paltrow's character of Polly Perkins was not developed very well.  She tends to whine and complain a lot, especially about not having enough film in her camera to take as many pictures as she would like to.  I wish that Franky would have had a larger part in the movie; Angelina Jolie did an excellent job in her role.<br /><br />I think that people who watch this movie will enjoy it.  The story is, for the most part, exciting and fun to watch, and the special effects are extremely well done.  I recommend this movie.  Watch and get a feel of what science fiction movies were like in the 1950's.</p></body></html>

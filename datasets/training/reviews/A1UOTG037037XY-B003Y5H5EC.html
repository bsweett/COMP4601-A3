Ellen Page is adorable; the camera loves her, her freckles, her perfect nose.  The colors are beautiful in this movie and Patrick Wilson looks like a Mormon AND The Big Bad Wolf, just unforgivably evil like Philip Seymour Hoffman in Doubt.  You just want to go Nun on both of them.</p></body></html>

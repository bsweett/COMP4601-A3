<meta name="summary" content="Transformers Revenge of the Fallen is blu-ray at its best!!!!"></head><body><p>The Transformers 2 Revenge of the Fallen blu-ray is nothing short of spectacular. The picture and sound are top notch. I was one of those kids who grew up watching Transformers and playing with all the cool transformer toys. I was thrilled when the first live Transformers movie came out a few years back. I was just as excited to see the new Transformers Revenge of The Fallen movie, but was a little worried after reading some pretty bad reviews. I don't know whats up with all the haters and critics who hate this movie. Oh well, all that matters is that I enjoyed it, and many Transformers fans will enjoy it as well. After seeing the new Transformers movie I can say the critics are wrong, this movie was awesome! The entire original cast is back which plays a huge part of this movies success. The movie takes off where the last one left off. Starscream (now the leader of the Decepticons) decides to return to earth from Cybertron to revive the Decepticon leader Megatron. After the Autobots discover Megatron has been revived and is now seeking revenge, Optimus Prime tries to get Sam to help them stop Megatron once and for all. This new movie is even more action packed than the first, and if you're a fan of Transformers you will most likely love this new movie. This is now one of the best looking blu-rays to date. The Walmart edition is similar to the IMAX Dark Knight edition, with a few fight scenes that fill up your entire TV, but other than that there's not much difference. There is no doubt that this will be the one of if not the biggest selling blu-ray to date. With the new PS3 slim and top notch release like this, I believe this is the movie to finally take blu-ray to the mainstream.<br /><br />As an added bonus, the Blu-ray will include an exclusive interactive feature that gives viewers the ability to customize their own robot characters and get a glimpse at a rogue robot. Out of all the available permutations, one will unlock an exclusive interview with Michael Bay about his plans for the next adventure.<br /><br />Two-Disc Special Edition DVD & Blu-ray:<br /><br />The TRANSFORMERS: Revenge of the Fallen specs below<br /><br />The Blu-ray is presented in 1080p high definition with English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital with English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese subtitles.

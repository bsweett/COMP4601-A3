<meta name="summary" content="A 'chick flick' with a high-heeled heart"></head><body><p>Not far into "In Her Shoes," Rose, played by Toni Collette, tells her sister, "You ruin everything!"<br /><br />She's right, too.<br /><br />Maggie, played by Cameron Diaz, is a party girl pushing 30 who's unemployed but works full time making messes. Sort of a Holly Go-Not-So-Lightly, she ruins borrowed clothes, parks in tow-away zones, is far better at consuming liquor than holding it and has a bad tendency to cozy up to the wrong guys.<br /><br />Lawyer Rose, on the other hand, has her act together but isn't much better off. Lonely and scrunched up, she reads romance novels through stark glasses and has a smile that's a little disconcerting. When she finds herself in bed with a co-worker, she sneaks a snapshot of him just to preserve a rare moment.<br /><br />Obviously, the sisters are both going through kind of a sad phase and when they have to move in together, they mix like bleach and ammonia. Their toxic conflict, however, nudges them in good directions.<br /><br />Director Curtis Hanson doesn't rush the story -- one thing happens, then the next -- but it's surprisingly enjoyable to watch as Rose and Maggie eventually try to fix themselves. It could've been slow going, or corny, but it isn't. The writing (by Susannah Grant, who adapted Jennifer Weiner's novel) is so natural, and the performances so assured, "Shoes" is easy to settle into. Diaz convincingly inverts her bubbly persona into something with dimensions far beyond "Charlie's Angels," while Collette is a refreshingly sympathetic grouch. And though they may not look anything at all like siblings, they do a fine job of acting like them.<br /><br />Also good is Shirley McLaine as the sisters' grandmother. She has played quite a few stern, disapproving women before (she's to chick flicks what Bruce Willis is to movies for guys who like movies), but here she very nicely downplays her usual volatility.<br /><br />At just over two hours, the film might strike some as a bit long, and I'm usually the first to complain about excessive length, but in thinking back about it afterward, it's hard to come up with anything that should've been cut.<br /><br />Smarter and more heartfelt than the previews suggest, "Shoes" is a tearjerker that earns its sniffles.</p></body></html>

Science fiction fans will not be impressed with the average repetitive special effects, but it does prove to be a good thrill ride.  Del Spooner (Will Smith) is distrustful of robots and you find out why later, although according to the three `rules', no robot can ever hurt a human being.  The plot is simple, but has enough action and plot twists to keep you entertained.  The car race scenes are exciting (only in that Del Spooner takes on an army of robots), if not somewhat unbelievable.  The special effects are reminiscent of "Tron", which proves that Hollywood could have done a lot better.  In any event, the ending wraps things up nicely and proves that it might not be the end of the world and there are good robots and bad robots - just like people.  Enjoy the ride.<br /><br />There are the average number of extras - nothing exciting, however, the DTS 5.1 Surround Sound is the best part.</p></body></html>

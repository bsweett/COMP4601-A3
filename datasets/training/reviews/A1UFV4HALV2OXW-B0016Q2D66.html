<meta name="summary" content="Good performance by the actors"></head><body><p>Revolutionary Road may feature the stars of Titanic - Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet  - but there's no Titanic love story here. It's the end of the line for a marriage. Frank and April Wheeler had hopes and dreams when they first got married but all they ended up with was disillusionment. A good performance by the actors, but not a movie for those looking for an uplifting story.</p></body></html>

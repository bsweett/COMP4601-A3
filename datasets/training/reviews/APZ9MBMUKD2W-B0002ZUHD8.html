I thought Excalibur was a better film than this one. But don't let me stop you from seeing King Arthur. It has some good moments like the battle at the frozen lake. It also gives one a good hint at what the beginning of the Dark Ages of Britain might of looked like.<br /><br />A solid B+ film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a guy with a flaming skull! what's not to like?"></head><body><p>Classic B movie fare. Nicolas Cage (as Johnny Blaze)channels his inner Elvis in some of the moves and gestures (watch the way he points to the crowd). Eva Mendes proves she can sure fill out a dress and is excellent eye candy. Plus you get a flaming motorcycle ridden by a guy with a flaming skullhead! What's not to like?<br /><br />Well, one thing is the typical Marvel Comic storyline which has the superhero all angst-ridden over his powers and predicament. Why can't Western superheroes not just be like Japanese superheroes--accept you have powers and start kicking evil butt?<br /><br />Gratuitous Peter Fonda shows up as the devil and thankfully a gratuitous Sam Elliot shows up halfway through to explain the whole storyline.<br /><br />The main flaw with this movie, though, is not enough Ghost Rider flaming skull action and too much Nic Cage and Eva Mendes attempting to act.<br /><br />The extras are boring--two audio commentary tracks and a couple of making ofs. But the soundtrack rocks thanks to Aussie band Spiderbait and the Melbourne sets are tremendous.<br /><br />All I can add is when is Ghost Rider 2 coming out and whomever gave this just one star needs a sense of humor. How can you not like the fact Johnny Blaze eats jelly beans out of a martini glass and is into monkey TV shows. This stuff is beyond classic on the intentional or unintentional comedy scale.</p></body></html>

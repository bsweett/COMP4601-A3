<meta name="summary" content="On the same level as Batman Begins, and that's saying something"></head><body><p>Iron Man is just a flat out fantastic comic book to film adaptation. I had high hopes going in given the amazing critic reviews and I was not let down in any way. Robert Downey Jr. lays down a great performance that easily ranks as one of the best ever in this genre of film. He is funny, smart, cool and just a unique individual. The supporting cast from Gwyneth Paltrow to Jeff Bridges are in fine form as well. The main reason I loved this movie so much was the fact that the cheese factor was very low (more like Batman than the cheese heavy Spiderman), not to mention all the cool tech gadgets. The CGI is only used when needed and looks realistic.<br /><br />My entire sold out theater went crazy throughout the movie and I must admit I even did at times. While The Dark Knight looks to be the film to beat this summer, Iron Man is truly a worthy foe. Now bring on the Iron Man 2!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="TIA..."></head><body><p>1990s. Sierra Leone. Civil War. Solomon Vandy (Hounsou) is taken away from his family to work in the diamond fields. Diamond smuggler Danny Archer (DiCaprio) ends up in prison where he overhears that Solomon has found a rare diamond and hidden it. Their quest for this diamond will bring them together. With the help of American journalist Maddy (Connelly), the two men will try to save Solomon's family.<br /><br />---Having lived in Africa myself, I can tell you that most of what you see in the film is true - unfortunately. Indeed, TIA... This Is Africa.---<br /><br />Wonderful script, decent acting from everyone - finally DiCaprio has a respectable role, and is actually good! -, great cinematography, my hats off to the scouting location manager.<br />The violence shown is rather evocative, and necessary to depict the country's situation.<br />Unfortunately I found the ending quite predictable.<br /><br />Still a very good film that I recommend to everyone.</p></body></html>

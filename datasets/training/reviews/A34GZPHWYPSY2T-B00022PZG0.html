I had never seen this oft-mentioned film; I have to say I was confused even at the middle of the film. Its comic value is fantastic and the children are all stunning performers ... I just had to ask myself what message the film was trying to convey.<br /><br />Briefly, Jack plays Dewey Finn, a washed-up has-been middle-aged rocker who is fired from his own band. So far so good: that could have been a terrific, biting satire base right there. But then he hornswaggles a gradeschool with his best friend's identity as a substitute teacher, in order to make some money. He ends up subbing at a prestigious prep grade school. He teaches the kids how to 'rock out' and appreciate the music. A bite of satire aimed at MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS and a well deserved one at that.<br /><br />But I had to ask myself: since it is pure satirical comedy, does there have to be a message? When it has a cast that is 98% children, then yes, it needs a meaning. Even a silly film has to tell us what they are trying to say about children and our relationship to children. I realize the excellent satire and social commentary in the film, but it just isn't that strong. Jack Black displays his genius here that later landed him so many great film roles.<br /><br />Aside from reliving a few memories from the oldest of the rock music, what was this? A parody of DEAD POET'S SOCIETY? A shot at the first two HARRY POTTER movies that had already been released by this time? An ode to rock-n-roll (which you can't really do with children this age)? What was it?<br /><br />The only balance to the genius of Jack Black was Joan Cusack, who displays here her own bulging comic genius so much that I felt Jack kind of shrinking in her presence a little. That was fun.<br /><br />And why so many questions about the message here? Well, this is a fun family film but I found Black's antics a bit much and perhaps not for everyone; rock music is not everyone's cup of tea; the message about education seemed way off also. It left me wondering just exactly what it was I had seen.<br /><br />Besides being a hilarious comedy classic. This one I leave to your judgment, but I can tell you there are usually far worse films out there with a PG rating. And this is vintage Jack Black.</p></body></html>

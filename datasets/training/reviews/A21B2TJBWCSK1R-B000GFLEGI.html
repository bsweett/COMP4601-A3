<meta name="summary" content="Romero's Political Zombies"></head><body><p>Recent years have seen a resurgence in the zombie film with the good (28 Days Later), the bad (Resident Evil) and the funny (Shaun of the Dead), but all of them pale in comparison to George A. Romero's trilogy of zombie films. The first two have been remade already, most recently it was Dawn of the Dead and both failed to build on or even recapture what made Romero's films so great in the first place. They seem to only be in love with the gore and miss (or just didn't understand) the socio-political message of them. The good news is that Romero is back with a new zombie movie that has been years in the making but it was well worth the wait.<br /><br />Romero has crafted a very smart horror movie which is something of a rarity these days what with all of these lames remakes littering the landscape. Land of the Dead has all of the requisite gore (and the unrated version has even more) while actually trying to say something. There are plenty of powerful images, like the undead rising out of the water at night (a nice nod to Carnival of Souls, one of the films that inspired Night of the Living Dead) or zombies crashing through the posh apartment complex and feasting on the wealthy. Like with his other zombie films, Land of the Dead is a commentary on the times in which it was made. And for that alone, his movie is a refreshing breath of fresh air.<br /><br />"Undead Again: The Making of Land of the Dead" is a promo puff piece as the cast and crew gush about Romero who looks like he is having a blast getting to play with a significant budget and working with name actors like Dennis Hopper. Unfortunately, the more substantial making of doc that aired on IFC is absent from this disc.<br /><br />"A Day with the Living Dead" features actor John Leguizamo taking us on a tour of the set and shamelessly mugging for the camera.<br /><br />"Bringing the Dead to Life" takes a look at how all of the nasty gore effects are done. Make-up guru Greg Nicotero demonstrates why he is probably the best zombie effects guy since Tom Savini. Nicotero went all out with this film to create some truly astounding (and unsettling) effects.<br /><br />"The Remaining Bits" is a collection of deleted footage that is only just little bits of business amounting to three minutes. While hardly essential it would've been nice to know why it was cut.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by Romero, producer Peter Grunwald and editor Michael Daughtery. Romero delivers a typically low key track. He's not quite as chatty as he has been on other commentaries but this is a newer film and he doesn't have the same kind of distanced perspective that he has on his other work. This results in several brief lulls between insightful comments.<br /><br />"When Shaun Met George" chronicles the classic meeting of Romero and Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright who made Shaun of the Dead, an excellent satire on Romero's zombie movies. This is an amusing featurette that follows the boys as they film their cameo for the movie, showing their transformation into the undead and basically living out every fanboy's dream.<br /><br />"Scenes of Carnage" is a brief montage of some of the film's most gruesome scenes scored lovingly to classical music.<br /><br />"Zombie Effects: From Green Screen to Finished Scene" shows a few scenes before CGI was added and after. It was used mostly to flesh out the backgrounds in the scenes, making them look more elaborate or amping up the gore a bit more.<br /><br />"Bring the Storyboards to Life" cuts between storyboard drawings and the final version or a few sequences in the movie.<br /><br />Finally, there is "Scream Tests: Zombie Casting Call," a pointless clip showing the early CGI tests of zombies dancing around a la the undead in Michael Jackson's music video "Thriller."</p></body></html>

All of the elements are here: the chase scenes, a creepy scene in a graveyard, clues to the mystery of the crystal skull provided by Professor Oxley and encounters with huge killed red ants, hostile natives and an amazing opening sequence ending with an atomic bomb test.<br /><br />It will go without saying that Harrison Ford reprises his role as Indiana Jones wonderfully but it is an older Jones who has had quite a few wartime adventures that we meet.  Cate Blanchett (Dr. Irina Spalko) is nicely cast and makes a good sword-carrying villain; she is marvelously single-minded pursuit of the crystal skull. Shia LeBouef really steals the film as Mutt Williams and is the quintessential 1950's motorcycle riding school dropout always worried about how his hair looks.  It was very good to see Karen Allen again in an Indiana Jones film as Marion (also Mutt William's mother); she brought a lot of energy to the film and her verbal sparing with Indiana Jones was a delight. John Hurt plays Professor Oxley, an archaeologist friend of Jones (nicknamed Ox), who is like a father figure to Mutt and found the crystal skull but mysteriously returned it.  Ray Winstone was good in the small role of McHale, who was certainly not to be trusted (but Indiana Jones is willing to forget his early double dealing for old time's sake).  Jim Broadbent is also good in the brief role of Dean Stanforth (substituting for the late Denholm Elliot who is nevertheless in on the action when a statue of Marcus Brody is crashed into by the KGB).<br /><br />My only problem with the film is the ending which I did not think was quite clear.  What was the reward for returning the crystal skull? In Raider's of the Lost Ark the villains are destroyed by the prize they think they have found. Dr. Spalko meet a similar fate in her quest for the ultimate psychic knowledge but one wonders what Professor Oxley's reward is for returning the skull was supposed to be.  I found the ending a bit anticlimactic on first viewing but I may change my opinion after I have seen the film more than one.<br /><br />The production and locations are fabulous and John Williams has once again written a great score.  Indiana Jones 4 will definitely be added to our DVD collection.</p></body></html>

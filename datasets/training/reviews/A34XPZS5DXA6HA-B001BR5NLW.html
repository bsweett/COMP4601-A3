<meta name="summary" content="Amazing!"></head><body><p>For anyone who has seen Pitch Black this will truly be a treat, but you won't have to have seen Pitch Black to enjoy this film.  This is a fantastically written story.  The effects are awesome, the cast is one of the best I have seen, and the costumes and set are amazing.  All of the above melds together so well you will have trouble remembering that this is something completly imaginary at times.  I enjoyed this flick throughly and feel it is a must have in my movie collection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This film give us much to think about"></head><body><p>The plot of this film is well know: Aliens descend to earth to destroy humanity because they see that humans are demolishing the planet. If the aliens rid earth of humans, earth will continue to exist and a new civilization could grow and inhabit it. Since the plot is so well known, I won't discuss it. I will point out that this film touches on so many subjects in provoking manners that it could be the basis for a semester college course discussing subjects such as the following:<br /><br />* From the point of view of literature, what are the similarities and differences with H. G. Well's The War of the Worlds.<br />* What is the significance of one of the aliens' statement, a being who had lived on earth for decades: "There is no way to change them. But there is another side, I love them. I consider myself lucky to have lived (as a human)." What is he referring to?<br />* Why do humans riot and steal when a calamity strikes?<br />* Do humans lack the will to change as the aliens claim? Is it a lack of ability rather than will?<br />* Or, is it true that when people are on the brink of destruction they find the will to change? Is there any example of this ever having happened?<br />* Compare the white woman's black son's difficulty in identifying with her and the humans' difficulty in dealing with the aliens.<br />* Do you think that what saved humanity in this film was the alien's understanding of humanity or his attraction to the beautiful human female or both? Do you see anything in the film that proves that humanity is worth saving?<br />* What does the film say about the lack of leadership generally and the inability of leaders to control people specifically?<br />* Is this a morality tale? What is a morality tale and what does it try to accomplish?<br />* What do you think about the alien's statement "Nothing in the universe dies; everything is transformed"?<br />* Is this film more than a delightful, exiting, well-acted drama?</p></body></html>

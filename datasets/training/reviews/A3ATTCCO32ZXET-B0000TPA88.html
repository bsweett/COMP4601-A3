With a few rare exceptions, it doesn't work.  Comics are a medium that can make extremely illogical scenes seem plausible, whereas film can take that same scene and render it ridiculous.  Consider these examples from the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen:<p>? The League is introduced to the Nautilus, a prototype Submarine.  It's roughly the size of the Titanic with sexy lines rivaling anything modern, with speed and maneuvering capabilities to match.  Keep in mind that this is supposed to be @ 1899.<br />? Oops, somebody took a high-performance sports car and tacked a body shell over it to resemble a Victorian land yacht.  That's the vehicle our heroes are jerking around through the streets of Venice on a chase scene.  Is it still 1899?<br />? In his over-the-top "Darth Vader meets Colonel Klink" getup, the villain just looks like he stepped out of a comic book.  Since this is a film, he shouldn't.<br />? Captive scientists in the villain's lair are performing genetic manipulations such as cloning with samples from our heroes.  Uhhhh....<br />? There's much more, but I think your intelligence was insulted enough with those.<p>A few words about the plot:  a motley assortment of people from around the world with extraordinary abilities are called to help Britannia foil an evil plot to start World War 1.  These include fictional literary characters like Dr. Jeckyll/Mr. Hyde, the Invisible Man, and Captain Nemo, as well as a few made-ups.  An interesting set up with lots of potential that just didn't get explored enough IMHO.  However, because of the above-mentioned problems with translating this to a film that was, oddly enough, marketed toward teens and adults sophisticated enough to sneer at it, this concept just seemed stupid.<p>Some nice things can be said about this movie.  The cast was well-chosen for their character roles, and do reasonably good jobs.  Visually, TLOEG was a wonderful rendition of a Victorian world made fantastic.  The special effects and art direction at least deserve nominations.  But that, my friends, is IT.<p>Rent TLOEG if you're into the comic series, just so you can see how our modern special effects technology did justice to it.  But remember to keep the volume turned off to avoid brain cramp.<br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></body></html>

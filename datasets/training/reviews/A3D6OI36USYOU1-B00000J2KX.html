<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick's vision falls waaaaay short once again."></head><body><p>Hard to disagree with Stephen King himself on that point. Highly disappointing if you're a King fan, but if you're another robotic Stanley Kubrick worshipper you will probably love this thing. <p>There's nothing scary or terrifying here, except Danny's constant spastic shaking and drooling, unless of course you're one of those people that has a habit of looking under your bed at nite to see if the boogeyman has paid you a visit. Boo!<p>And if I was stranded on a mountain in a haunted hotel, no doubt that Scatman Crother's would be my first choice for a rescue. haw haw Some semi-haunting and nifty visuals as you might expect but the story doesn't gel, and people...you'll want Shelley Duvall to be disposed of in the most gruesome manner possible. What were they thinking casting her in the part of Wendy? <p>Nicholson was great in his prime, but this movie could have been so much better. King's best work gets the chop on the altar of artistic creativity. Two Axes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="To Hell In A Handbag"></head><body><p>There's good news and bad news about The Devil Wears Prada.  Since this Season In Hell everyone who's anyone will be wearing hobnail boots, lets start with the bad news.  This movie is awful, even as a chick-flick guilty pleasure it's awful.  The plot is hackneyed to the point of exhaustion, the ending is glib and facile, the characters are so two dimensional that when they turn sideways all you can see is the label, and the engine driving the alleged action - the scary power of Miranda Priestly - emanates from her ability to determine what color sweater the likes of us will be wearing next year.  In sum - it's the fashion industry folks - it doesn't matter - compared to this world cotton candy looks substantial.<br /><br />Now the good news.  Anne Hathaway is adorable as Andy Sachs, and makes her ridiculous role believable - she sells it.  She's as appealing in jeans as she is in couture.  Stanley Tucci is perfect - perfect - as Nigel.  I have never seen Tucci turn in a bad performance - he is absolutely amazing.  The role would have been easy to send over the top but Tucci nails it with restraint and class, fantastic.<br /><br />Of course the showcase here is Meryl Streep - and honestly - although it's heresy - I've never cared much for her work.  Sadly her role is not even two-dimensional, it's almost one-dimensional - but she carries it off so well that you just don't care.  It's a hoot watching her, and she's obviously having a ball.  As you might imagine, it's a visually pleasing movie, the fashion plates just keep passing by, which is fun.  Male characters fare badly, Andy's boyfriend is a waste of atoms and her bad boy love interest is completely unconvincing as a straight male putting the moves on a woman.  Special bonus points to Emily Blunt who turns in an outstanding performance as Priestly's assistant Emily - she perfectly embodies the neurotic cattiness and one-upsmanship of the industry.<br /><br />To be found at the back of the store with the other distressed goods, on the rack; the torture rack.</p></body></html>

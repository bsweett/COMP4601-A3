<meta name="summary" content="you've got to love R. Lee Ermey"></head><body><p>hey , i was a young person in the 1970s . ten by 73 . yes , it's not a brilliantly accurate period (piece) but it's a damn scary and funny one . in the incredibly capable hands of Lee Ermey we get the ultra smarmy and hilariously over-the-top villian we need . what more could you possibly ask for ? it's not "North by nothwest" for gods sake . the young people go threw living hell and die very brutally (which i personally found truly horrifying and kinda fitting) . they did commit the wanton sins of being young and seeking a good time . this truly is a scary and sick little film . all i can add is two very enthusiastic thumbs off .</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Over The Top Romp That Will Have You Aching From Laughter"></head><body><p>MOVIE:  Trey Parker and Matt Stone create a genre within themselves and this is their latest addition.  What this movie basically is, is a spoof of big budget action movies and politics.  The whole movie is laugh out loud.  Whether it was the rebellious actors of the Film Actors Guild (...) teaming with Kim Jong Il or the many spoofs put on action movies. There is an entire montage scene and with it is a song that describes what a montage really is. An entire song is dedicated to Michael Bay and how he screwed up with Pearl Harbor. Then there is puppet sex, oh so hilarious puppet sex. The movie feels a lot like South Park, but it's different enough to hold on its own. Every joke in this movie is laugh out loud funny. I only recount having one or two moments to catch my breath. Every time Team America comes flying out in full force, the Team America theme song plays along, "Team America, F&%K YEAH!" Then there's the aspect that they actually got Harry Gregson-Williams to do the score of the movie so it actually sounded like an over-produced action movie. The political references come flying in one after another, and so do the movie references.  Every action movie cliche is addressed here and will have you laughing.  What really makes it funny is the stiff limited movement these puppets have. When the main character fights Samuel L. Jackson it's the funniest thing I have ever seen. The shootouts are hilarious and so is Kim Jong Il who has a solo of singing "Lonely, I'm So Lonely".  Absolutely hilarious, is how they make fun of America's "intelligence", which is depicted in the movie as a computer that sounds like a teenage stoner.  "There's no I in Team America" says the head of operations, (long pause), "Umm, yeah there is", says intelligence.  The list goes on and on of what they make fun of, including the depiction of various races and origins like Muslims, Asians, and Hispanics. The movie is a mess, the jokes come flying in hard and fast, it's rude, it's crude, it's one of the funniest things I have ever seen.<br /><br />ACTING: One of the movie's main continuing joke is actors, so naturally they use puppets instead. Most of the voices are done by Matt and Trey, a lot you will recognize from South Park, but still oh so painfully funny.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: This is one of the most entertaining movies ever made. If you think of this as just plain potty humor you are mistaken. So many political aspects of our world are attacked within the spoofs and satire, same goes for Hollywood. Very original and smart is what this movie is under all the outrageous stunts and scenes. You will be dead tired after this movie from laughing so much, and you will be laughing at it for quite some time after you walk out of the theater. By no means a work of art, but a brilliantly and comically crafted piece of pop culture entertainment.</p></body></html>

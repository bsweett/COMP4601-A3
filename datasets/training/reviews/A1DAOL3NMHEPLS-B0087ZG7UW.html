<meta name="summary" content="THE timeless, classic terror movie!"></head><body><p>There's little I can add to what others have already written. I saw "Psycho" in the theatre when it first came out -- and, like everyone else, nearly jumped out of my seat at the famous shower scene.  But there's more to the movie than that. A lot more. It's one of the greatest suspense thrillers of all time, and Anthony Perkins' portrayal of the creepy, schizophrenic Norman Bates is still unsettling.<br /><br />The extras on the Collector's edition are worthwhile, although Janet Leigh drones on way too long, repeating herself endlessly and saying "you know" about 50 times. Someone should have edited her interview down by about 70%.<br /><br />Still, it's a great movie. A true landmark in the history of film that holds up well nearly a half-century later. Five stars for sure!</p></body></html>

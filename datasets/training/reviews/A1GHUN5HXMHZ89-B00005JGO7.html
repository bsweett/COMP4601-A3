I bought this based on the reviews here, and I'm glad I did. Being a fan of movies like "Weekend at Bernie's", "Get Shorty", "Formula 51", and "The Transporter", I was not disappointed. I highly recommend this movie. It has superb editing, great acting, and wonderful music. It was so seamlessly made I have to say I am surprised this was not a big hit. But at least apparently it is getting its second wind like "Get Shorty" did some time after it was released on DVD. Don't be surprised if we don't see a sequel to this one in a couple years. I really didn't know what to expect from this movie.<br /><br />It drew me along and familiarized me with the characters as we went down this winding path. The characters you thought would be killed somehow survive, and those you expected not to die are sometimes killed. The ways they are killed are often funny. There truly is genius that went into putting this all together. I didn't use the subtitles and I loved it in its raw in your face form. Most of the dialogue is easily discernable if you have watched Brit movies for awhile. If not it may take you a couple viewings to take it all in. Quite honestly I'm looking forward to watching this again very soon. It has great replayability and plenty of extras on the disc. The picture and sound quality were excellent.</p></body></html>

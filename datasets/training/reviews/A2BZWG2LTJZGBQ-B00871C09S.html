<meta name="summary" content="The ultimate voyeristic thriller!"></head><body><p>Hitchcock directed his movies so that the audience would see and feel exactly what the characters in the movie experienced.  Never was this done more obviously or more effectively than in Rear Window, the 1954 classic with Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly.  <p>Stewart is a magazine photographer who has suffered a broken leg.  He is forced to spend most of his day in a wheelchair, and his only entertainment is staring out the window of his Greenwich Village apartment.  Kelly is in love with him and wants to marry him.  He wants no part of that (for some reason) and is contemplating ending the relationship.<p>It is interesting that we learn a lot about six or seven of his neighbors just by watching with Stewart.  There's the songwriter, who goes from failure to success right before our eyes, and the newlywed couple, who move in at the beginning full of love and lust and end up at the end like a couple married for 20 years.  Miss Torso is his name for a shapely young woman with multiple suitors and he calls another Miss Lonelyhearts, who is desperate for companionship.<p>The most interesting neighbor is Raymond Burr.  He has an invalid wife who disappears suddenly.  Stewart sees suspicious things in the middle of the night and develops a theory that Burr has killed his wife and disposed of her.  At first no one believes him, but eventually they come along and spy with him, trying to figure out what happened.  Stewart has a detective friend who refuses to be convinced, but Stewart tries over and over to explain why he thinks the wife is dead.<p>Throughout the film, Hitchcock has us totally hooked.  We are right there with Stewart and we are totally enamored by Kelly, who may have one of the most sensual screen openings in film history.  Thelma Ritter is Stewart's housemaid, and she dispenses advice on relationships and how to handle this supposed murder.<p>In the end, we learn whether Stewart's suspicions have any merit.  I can say that there is lots of tension and suspense along the way.  It takes real guts to make a film like this, where you are limited to one section of a room for almost two hours.  Hitchcock's genius is clearly obvious here.  One of the master's five best films of all time.</p></body></html>

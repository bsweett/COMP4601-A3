That title probably goes to Raiders. Still, Crystal Skull is still a fun movie and certainly has much of the feel of the Indiana Jones series. Despite some risks and questionable choices, it works well overall. The relationship between Indy and his lost son, Mutt, is actually one of the better parts of the film. Mutt is a likable character who grows over the film. Unlike some of the other characters (more on that later) he actually brings quite a bit to the movie.<br /><br />The plot works surprisingly well too. I initially thought it would be a cheesy aliens movie, but the alien presence is subtle. By and large, this is still Indy going into lost cities looking for treasure. I admit it's not the greatest MacGuffin and not my first choice, but given that choice Spielberg and Lucas used the idea well.  I suspect whether you like Crystal Skull or not depends upon your view of the Crystal Skull as the MacGuffin. If you hate it and can't accept it, then you won't like the film.<br /><br />That said, the movie suffers from a few misguided choices. First, as others have noted, there are too many over-the-top situations. I know Indiana Jones isn't supposed to be realistic, but too often the characters would survive some impossible situation - the multiple waterfalls, driving onto a tree branch, and, of course, nuking the fridge - and I'd nearly roll my eyes. However, more than the particular scenarios is that by and large the characters faced these situations passively, by essentially "bracing for impact."<br /><br />Also, I didn't think bringing Marion (Karen Allen) back worked so well.  It got about 30 seconds worth of nostalgia, but otherwise she doesn't really do much. Sure she's there and drives the duck, but it feels like the movie barely reintroduces us to her before she's off marrying Indy. I suspect this is because the movie already has a lot of supporting characters, particularly Mac and Oxley, most of who are simply not that compelling. It's simply too many people to introduce into a film like this. Even in Last Crusade, with it's large ensemble, we had already met Brody and Salleh before and could empathize more with the characters.<br /><br />Overall, I'm quite pleased that Spielberg and Lucas decided to make a 4th Indiana Jones movie. It's not the greatest of the bunch, but it certainly doesn't detract from the series. It's worth a try if you're an Indy fan.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Solid Performance By Tom Cruise. Cruise DELIVERS!!"></head><body><p>Tom Cruise ("The Last Samurai", "M:I-2", etc.) delivers a top notch performance as Vincent, a hit man who hires a cabbie (Jamie Foxx, "Ray" coming October 29) to drive him to his "appointments". The movie is a slam dunk for Cruise, in his first real stab at playing a genuine villain (try "Richard III" next, ok, Tom?) and a virtual knockout punch for Mann ("Ali", "The Last Of The Mohicans", etc.) Mark Ruffalo ("13 Going On 30", etc.) and /Jada Pinkett-Smith ("Woo", etc.) have small roles in this entertaining thriller. Jason Statham ("The Transporter", "The Italian Job") has a cameo at the beginning of the film.  Cruise takes his performance to another level with this one. He's not a TOTAL villain, like Richard III (in the play named for him) or Iago (in Othello), but he either "Scares you or thrills you." Thrilled me all the way through. The ending SUCKED, however, but overall, it was an excellent thrill ride. This movie IS NOT for kids. Rated PG-13 for some violence and language.</p></body></html>

Steven Speilberg's thrilling blockbuster masterpiece that became the highest grossing movie in worldwide box office history for some time. On an Island of the coast of Costa Rica, John Hammond has set up a biological reserve with genetically engineered dinosaurs, the result: JURASSIC PARK. He has invited paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant, Paleobotanist Dr. Elly Satler, Dr. Ian Malcom and his grandchildren Tim and Lex. When the power is shut down and the dinosaurs get loose from their electric fences. the park is no longer safe. The menacing T-Rex,Velicoraptors and many others are out on the island. What began as weekend excursion became a fight for survival from prehistory's greatest beasts. This film is one of Speilberg's best,an imaginative,brilliant,thrilling roaring ride,a triumph for all ages to enjoy. Steven Speilberg was the king of movie animals from JAWS to Jurassic Park. One of the most honoral films ever and  one of the most honorable for visual effects, the dinosaurs are one of the most real looking animals ever on the screen. I recommend this for a dinosaur movie,a speilberg movie and great movie all around. If Like Jurassic Park you should see the Lost World:Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III. this is an thrilling epic not to be missed and it seems only yesterday this was this ruled the box office in 1993, it is the highest grossing movie of 93 and in my opinon the best of 93. Bring home one of  cinema history's greatest triumphs. Welcome to Jurassic Park.</p></body></html>

To put it bluntly, this movie is vast and it does have a lot of style, monsters, and characters but in the end it lacks something more. To put it more simply. I'll let you weigh the pors and cons so that you can decide whether you wanna buy it or not. I bought it right away without even thinking.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Original storyline<br /><br />-Cool gadjets<br /><br />-Cool Guns<br /><br />-Cool special effects<br /><br />-Well-built sets<br /><br />-Cool first person perspective scene.<br /><br />-Good scar tactics.<br /><br />-feels like a videogame.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-sometimes the characters do nothing but search.<br /><br />-Too much walking around in the dark.<br /><br />-The suspense, at times, gets boring.<br /><br />-And finally, the rock cannot act. How are you going to wear the same expression saying each and every line. It's almost like there is no emphases on any word. It really gets repeatative.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""It's A Web, Go Spidey Go! ~ The Hero In All Of Us""></head><body><p>Following up on the tremendous success of the first Spider-Man film, `Spider-Man 2' swung into action two years later in '04 re-uniting Maguire, Dunst and Franco and most of the original cast in a sequel worthy of its predecessor. In this second installment of the series Spidey battles another deranged scientist, the multi-appendaged Doctor Octopus played by Alfred Molina.<br /><br />Along with the expected high quality special effects, terrific action sequences and unfulfilled romantic desires between Peter Parker (Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Dunst) this storyline delves into the deeper, more complex aspects of the Parker/Spider-Man psyche. The death of his best friends Father and his beloved Uncle Ben, his inability to share his secret with the girl he loves and the heavy responsibility of being a superhero take a toll on a young man. Is it better than the first? There are many who think so and they may be right, but either way it's definitely a welcomed addition to the Spider-Man saga!</p></body></html>

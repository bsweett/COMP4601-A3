<meta name="summary" content="Ah corporate greed; can it be overcome; should it be?"></head><body><p>This is a fun little story. It is adapted form a book and adjusted with a few changes to a formula (very predictable) story of corporate greed vs. individual morality.  On this inner journey for the beauty of one's soul we are treated to an outward experience of the world of fashion.<br /><br />Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) an aspiring writer is hard up for a job and lands one as an assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep ), top fashion designer and feared ruthless executive. Soon she is sucked into a would that She had not idea existed. In the book she is entices by the perks of free stylish goodies. In the move she is slowly seduced by the devil (Miranda) herself .  She is mentored and guides past the competition by Nigel (Stanley Tucci.)<br /><br />Do you recognize the Vivian West and Bill Ballast? How about the other vintage styles.  Just as the styles will not distract from the movie neither will the sound score which does not try to compete with the dialog; however it does abruptly change volume.<br /><br />Even if the story is formula the acting and actors make this a fun way to pass time. So gird  your loins.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N89S">She-Devil ~ Meryl Streep</a></p></body></html>

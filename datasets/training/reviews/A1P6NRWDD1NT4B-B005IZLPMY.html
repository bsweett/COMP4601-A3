One of the best things of the film is that it is a World War II movie and a super-hero movie all rolled into one. Faithful to the character's comic-book origin and with overtones of patriotism and good 'ol fashioned American values, the movie is somewhat of a throwback to old time movie-making story-telling. MARVEL studios went all out to make the tone just right and the production values top-notch with excellent casting. From Tommy Lee Jones in a great support roll as Col. Chester Phillips, Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull/Johann Schmidt, the Howard Hughes composit Howard Stark (father to Tony Stark aka IRON MAN)played by Dominic Cooper, Chris Evans is excellent in the title role, and finally Stanley Tucci is perfectly cast as Dr. Abraham Erskine (the kindly scientist who sees the good in Steve Rogers to make him the candidate to use his scientific research and create Captain America)... The film delivers on all parts of the super-hero film genre. A definite must-see film.</p></body></html>

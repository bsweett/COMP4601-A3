<meta name="summary" content="Hysterical horror film"></head><body><p>Props to Sam Raimi for making a film that defies the typical conventions of horror. As he did for the last two Evil Dead films (even though the second was a higher budget remake of the first) he was poking fun at the horror genre. Moreover, let's face it, there's a lot to be made fun of.<br /><br />When I read the plot description, I was certain that this film would be disastrous. Ash, going back in time, to the Middle Ages nonetheless, to help King Arthur win a battle against the "army of the dead". It was preposterous. Yet somehow, he pulled it off. The same irreverent wit that fueled the low budget first film, and the slightly higher budget second film, was in full display here. In addition, I understood why horror buffs are interested in an Ash vs. Freddy vs. Jason film. Actually, the only reason I watched Evil Dead was to understand why Ash would play a pivotal role if that film was ever made. Now I know. And I hope that they make it - and I hope that someone talented writes the script and directs it. Freddy vs. Jason was a complete disaster.<br /><br />Nothing about this film made sense, and that was the brilliance of it. Where did Ash come up with a Chemistry 101 textbook that taught him how to make gunpowder? How was he able to escape the first Necromonicon book when it sucked him in with (apparently) the force of a tornado? And how was Ash capable of teaching many of Arthur's knights how to "really" fight? Seriously - this may have been the Middle Ages, but these guys knew how to handle a halberd, and knew how to handle it better than Ash.<br /><br />But that was the brilliance of the film. It poked fun at just about everything, and when it wasn't poking fun it was paying homage. When Henry the Red's forces aligned at the top of a hilltop to fall upon the Army of Darkness, that was straight out of The Lord of the Rings. And I'm not talking about the movie, which was made almost a decade later. I'm talking about the book, which was written thirty years prior. However, that's not a criticism. It's part of a hysterical script that was not supposed to be taken seriously. Horror films fall into two categories: those that are meant to be taken seriously, and those that poke fun at themselves. Army of Darkness fell into the latter, and did a marvelous job. I found myself laughing aloud at *several* points. It was ingenious.<br /><br />Even non-horror buffs would find this amusing.</p></body></html>

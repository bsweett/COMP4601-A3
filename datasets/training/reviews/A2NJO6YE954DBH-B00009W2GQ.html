<meta name="summary" content="Big time eye candy even if it falls short of expectations"></head><body><p>I rewatched &quot;The Matrix&quot; before I watched &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; on DVD, so that when I went to the theater and saw &quot;The Matrix Revolutions,&quot; I would have a fighting chance of being able to follow along and possibly appreciate the climax.  I would not say that the ending was predictable per se, but given the pair of problems afflicting Neo's world (the sentinels are coming to Zion City to kill all the humans while Smith is taking over every being in the Matrix) the solution has the virtue of logic (albeit Hollywood rather than cybernetic).  Anyway, I am not all that sure that thinking too much about this film is necessary for enjoying it, although I did take small pleasure in being ahead of Neo a couple of times in the film.  I do not thing there really could be any other ending, given the set up, but if you were expecting something spectacularly new and more substance than style in the conclusions of the trilogy, you are going to be disappointed.<p>&quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; comes down to two gigantic battles.  The first is the defense of the dock in Zion City when the sentinels break through.  What we have at that point is basically the biggest shootout video game you have ever seen.  The second is the final showdown between Neo and Smith, which manages to combine the contradictory principles of bigger and better with less is more.  While each is going on you are two busy enjoying the spectacle to be overly concerned with what it all means in the end.  I mean, sometimes a EMP is a good thing and who cares if kicking a computer virus is really not going to do it much harm?  <p>For me this was the biggest kitchen sink movie I have ever seen.  The whole &quot;Matrix&quot; idea got props for being cutting edge, but for the finale I was repeatedly struck by bits and pieces of dozens of other films and had to fight down an urge to yell, &quot;Use the Force, Neo!&quot;  But there is a vessell fighting off attackers like &quot;Star Wars,&quot; big guns like in &quot;Aliens,&quot; millions of attacking creatures like in &quot;Star Ship Troopers,&quot; several scenes lifted from World War II movies, Neo fights Smith in a driving rain like the climax of &quot;The Seven Samurai,&quot; and dozens of other cinematic references.  This is not to say that these references are intentional homages, but neither are they intrusive (cf. &quot;The Rock&quot;).  <p>I was also struck by how &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; has the same basic structure as &quot;The Return of the King,&quot; the upcoming conclusion of &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; in that you have a giant pivotal battle (the Battle of the Pelinor Fields) and then the whole thing comes down to a mano e mano confrontation (Frodo and Gollum).  It also occurs to me with both of those movies and &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; earlier this year, actor Hugo Weaving (Smith and Elrond), has the opportunity to be the first actor to ever appear in movies that came out in a single year that could end up earning $1 billion in the United States.  At the end of the first week of release of this film he has already broken the $400 million mark.</p></body></html>

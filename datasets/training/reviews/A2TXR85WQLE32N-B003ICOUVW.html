<meta name="summary" content="The Wolfman: A Remake..."></head><body><p>The 1941 horror classic "The Wolfman", starring Lon Chaney Jr, featured primitive special effects and a simple, horrific, yet sympathetic tale of a man, bitten by an unknown creature, who becomes a monster at each full moon, and who yearns for release from his terrible curse.<br /><br />Fast-forward to 2010's "The Wolf Man."  Laurence Talbot is summoned back to his ancestral home of Talbot Hall on the disappearance of his brother.  He arrives to find his brother murdered and multilated, and rashly promises his brother's grieving fiancee Gwen that he will uncover the truth.  He visits the local gypsies for answers, only to be bitten by a mysterious beast.<br /><br />Nursed back to health by Gwen, Laurence is under suspicion by the local villagers, who fear a monster, and by Scotland Yard Inspecter Aberline, who seeks a murdering lunatic.  When the killings resume at the next full moon, Laurence discovers the nature of his curse.  He is confined at a facility for the criminally insane.  There, a visit from his father Sir John reveals the full horror of his situation.  Laurence will escape the mental institution to seek his fate at Talbot Hall.<br /><br />The movie generally follows the 1941 original, with some plot twists involving the (very) troubled Talbot family history.  Bernicio del Toro is a sympathetic Laurence.  Emily Blunt is stoic and effective as Gwen.  Hugo Weaving almost steals the movie as Inspector Aberline.  Anthony Hopkins is in full scenery-chewing mode as Sir John.  The famous Chatsworth Hall is morphed into a dark, brooding and decrepit Talbot Hall.  The movie is full of things that go bump in the night, both real and imagined.  The CGI effects are frightening, if surreal and a bit overdone.<br /><br />"The Wolf Man" is highly recommended as an entertaining horror flick and a decently-done successor to the original.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Love, Life Hurts But Johnny is Redeemed"></head><body><p>The short reply to describing "Walk the Line" is that it is a solid, real-life story of redemption, of a man who finds out who he is and sings from his heart. The story of Johnny Cash's life is told well, sung well, and produced well.<br /><br />Johnny Cash's life is one spared of the consequences of his worst mistakes. When his first wife left him after realizing Johnny's character was in question, when drugs and affairs began to ruin him, he found June. When drugs and alcohol took him down, he found his soul and his way back up.<br /><br />"Walk the Line" covers the transformation of a child blamed for his brother's accidental death, the drive to succeed as a gospel singer, and the desire to be loved without restrictions.<br /><br />I like Johnny Cash. Always have. His voice sounded off-the-cuff, like someone called him on stage unexpectedly. It is rough, resonant with tobacco and alcohol strained vocal cords, with enough twang to keep it country and enough power to keep it rock. All of these come through adequately in Joaquin Phoenix's attempts, but he's no Johnny Cash. That's a tough act to follow, and I give Phoenix credit for as much as he pulls off musically.<br /><br />Beyond my thoughts of Phoenix's mediocre singing, I give him applause for acting. Not only does he have Cash's signature talking from the side of his mouth, but he has the attitude, the stare, the characteristics that remind me of the Johnny Cash seen on TV throughout the years.<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon delivers a persona of June Carter that is extraordinarily sweet. It has to believe she went through so many marriages before finally settling on Johnny. She sings well, and to the ear who has not heard the original, she's enjoyable. The comparison between the two is not fair: one is a musical icon, and the other is only portraying the icon.<br /><br />As storytelling goes, the movie ends in the late 1960s. Johnny and June's life is summed up with that they lived happily ever after. It misses the complete transition, where Johnny's broken life appears to have been a dream, where he goes on to sing more great songs, and even sings for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association crusades.<br /><br />To compare the three recent biopics I have seen, this is the best. While "Ray" is powerful, Ray Charles' own life only evolves. It never transforms. He is only a great singer and a good man at the end. Johnny becomes a great man after not being much of one.<br /><br />In "Beyond the Sea," it lacks by comparison because, partly, Bobby Darin's life was shorter and less dramatic, and also, Cash's catalog of hits is volumes larger.<br /><br />By the end of "Beyond the Sea," I was tired of a few songs. In "Walk the Line," I kept thinking, "Where's 'Don't Take Your Guns To Town,' 'Guess Things Happen That Way,' and 'Sunday Morning Coming Down'? What about 'A Boy Named Sue'?" I wanted more music. Those are fantastic, but the movie's director could not use them all.<br /><br />Shaky parts of the movie are found in how it seems Johnny's spiral downward always held to a glimmer that he was a good man making bad choices. However true that is, it came off whitewashing some of the uglier sides of his hard times, and missed an opportunity to show why his songs have credibility.<br /><br />See it in the theater to enjoy their sound system while you still can.<br /><br />I fully recommend "Walk the Line."<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com</p></body></html>

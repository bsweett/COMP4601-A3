<meta name="summary" content="another pleasant surprise..."></head><body><p>After enjoying "John Carter", I was equally surprised to discover that "PotC4" was not the oven-ready gobbler so many critics made it out to be. One of the "shill" critics said it was the best of the series -- and there's a big grain of truth in that.<br /><br />"PotC2" and "PotC3" -- regardless of their merits as stories -- were plot-heavy. That there were three groups with differing, conflicting goals -- which were never particularly clear -- didn't help one's enjoyment.<br /><br />"PotC4" has a clearer and less-baroque storyline. There are still three groups, but we know what two of them are doing, and why. (The Spaniards' motive isn't revealed until the end, and it's a real -- and highly logical -- surprise.)<br /><br />Johnny Depp is back to playing the (relatively) more-sober and less-overtly flamboyant Captain Jack of the first film, a major plus. (Don't forget that he got an Oscar nomination for that performance. A best-actor nomination for fantasy, sci-fi, horror, or action roles is almost unheard-of. *)<br /><br />The first two-thirds are extremely funny, but the story turns uncharacteristically (for this series) dark towards the end, becoming a kind of "Splash Meets Jaws". Also uncharacteristically, the story (semi-)seriously examines issues of morality and redemption. The ending is startlingly misogynistic -- which is not surprising behavior for pirates.<br /><br />If I have any generic complaint about the series as a whole, it's that there are no //really good// sword fights. This is probably for practical reasons -- none of the stories builds to a sword-fighting climax (as "The Adventures of Robin Hood" and "Rob Roy" do), so there's no point in training the actors. The days of Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone are long gone.<br /><br />The PG-13 rating is justified -- this is not a film for the youngsters. (I seriously question the ethics of LEGO's marketing products based specifically on this film.)<br /><br />I really enjoyed "On Stranger Tides", when I didn't expect to. I can't guarantee anything, but if you liked the first one, you'll probably like the last.<br /><br />* Frederic March got an Oscar for "Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde", and Anthony Hopkins got an (undeserved) Oscar for "The Silence of the Lambs".</p></body></html>

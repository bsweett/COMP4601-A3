<meta name="summary" content="Captures Christmas spirit"></head><body><p>Believing in the spirit of Christmas becomes a challenge for a young boy in the charming movie "The Polar Express" based on Chris Van Allburg's children's book. On Christmas Eve the boy is invited to ride a train to the North Pole by the conductor (Tom Hanks) and a chance to discover the his power to believe in  Christmas once and for all.<br /><br />Although audiences initially gave "Express" a chilly reception the film actually more than broke even at the box office due to repeat visits from fans of the film and a vaunted IMAX presentation. While there have been complaints that the motion capture technology used here (a familiar technique used less extensively in "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, "I, Robot" and "King Kong") giving the characters a creepy look, I found the film to be perfectly charming and no less inviting than watching any other CGI movie. While it's clear that this technique is still in its infancy (or, perhaps, in the toddler phase at this point), director Zemeckis makes good use of the technique to render characters that are believable and amazing background for the film.  "The Polar Express" is guaranteed to be a perennial at Christmas time. Tom Hanks essays a number of roles in the film which is something that could have been done without CGI (think of Peter Sellers and all the characters he played in "Dr. Strangelove" or Mike Myers in the Austin Powers movies) but the use of CGI makes the transformation into other characters a bit more believable visually.<br /><br />"Express" looks quite good on DVD. We don't see any analog artifacts (not a surprise given that it was shot digitally and rendered in a computer) nor do we see edge enhancement or other digital artifacts I've come to expect from movies shot either on film. Again, this isn't a surprise given the fact that this was transferred directly from the digital files to DVD. The colors on the train are warm and inviting while those set outside in the chilly, snow filled night has just the right frosty edge to them. The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound track sounds marvelous with crisp, clear dialogue and nice use of the surround format. The rear speakers get considerable workout with ambience and the rattle filled ride on the train enveloping us in the world of the film.<br /><br />The release of single and double disc movies is becoming more of a trend. It's clear that studios recognize that there are those who watch only the movie and have begun tailoring their DVD releases more and more for different segments of the audience. The single disc edition has just the movie and a trailer (unless you purchased the single disc edition at Best Buy--it comes with a mini-DVD that features footage from "You Look Familiar" one of the extras on the two disc edition).<br /><br />On the two disc edition you get a whole lot of extras some of which are interesting but hardly essential. "You Look Familiar" focuses on the performances of Tom Hanks and others in their multiple roles and the use of performance capture to enhance their acting for the film. We see footage of the live performance capture work show with the scene from the film which is a nice before and after comparison.<br /><br />"Genuine Ticket to Ride" features five featurettes after an introduction. "Performance Capture", "Virtual Camera", "Hair and Wardrobe", "Creating the North Pole" and "Music". At under 12 minutes it can't possible offer the depth that filmmakers might want. Nevertheless you'll learn a thing or two about the production and the obstacles, challenges and triumphs that faced the film crew.<br /><br />"Josh Groban at the Greek" features the popular singer performing the song "Believe" as well as a featurette on the creation of the song. "Meet the Snow Angels" Share the memories of cast and crew about their favorite Christmas. "Polar Express Challenge" provides an interactive game. It's not bad but kids will only want to play once or twice and forget about it once the novelty wears off. There's also a number of bonus clips throughout the second disc that are called "Stocking Stuffers" to be discovered for those who wisely use their remote control.<br /><br />Surprisingly Warner chose not to provide much detail or in depth background on the production of the film and its CGI rendering techniques. That's too bad. While this kid friendly approach will certainly be appreciated by the film's core audience, adults like to be entertained and informed as well. Perhaps we'll see something more adult orientated in the "Special Special Edition" that will no doubt come out just in time for the Holidays next year.<br /><br />"The Polar Express" charms with its delightful performances, groundbreaking use of CGI and "performance capture". While the extras could have been more comprehensive and more filling, they aren't bad. I'd suggest sticking to the single disc edition since the movie is the real highlight and the second disc probably won't be watched more than once (if that). Zemeckis has done a terrific job translating this children's story to the screen although it does have the feeling that it is padded a bit. I'd recommend the single disc edition vs. the two disc as I didn't feel the additional extras were all they were cracked up to be. Everybody jump on board but make sure to bring some hot chocolate and a nice warm blanket as it's going to be a long but fun filled ride.</p></body></html>

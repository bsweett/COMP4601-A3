<meta name="summary" content="Maybe not "Clunk of the Titans" but disappointing nonetheless"></head><body><p>A good amount of action and impressive CGI bolsters this remake which to be honest flags a bit at times.<br />Even an A list cast, and Sam Worthington (fresh from Avatar and Terminator Salvation) unfortunately can't lift it above average.<br />The usual debate ensues about the 3D added as an afterthought, and whether it adds anything, I saw the 2D version so can't comment on that, although I noticed a couple of scenes obviously deliberately designed with the 3D medium in mind.<br />On a side note, if 3D is going to be the new gold standard, then please filmmakers, stop using every opportunity to have things fly out of the screen for a cheap effect. Avatar was good in 3D exactly because it did not exploit the audience, but I digress.<br />Most people who remember Harry Hamlin et al in the 1981 original will not be able to help but make comparisons, and the storyline and chronology is quite similar.<br />However, whereas I would not have said the original was a deep drama, it had a far more solid story, and makes this updated CGI festival pale in comparison.<br />As much as I like Sam Worthington, he was wooden most of the time, pausing between action sequences to deliver  "man against the Gods" speeches, which he fails to carry off each time with any conviction.<br />The biggest difference in the two movies is of course that the first was a love story.<br />Perseus, driven by his love for Andromeda (the beautiful and delicate Judy Bowker) has a passion, that is missing here somehow. As Perseus is merely on a vendetta against Hades.<br />The feud and story with Calibos was much more integral to the plot than here also, where this time around that character seems to be little more than a disgruntled mercenary working for Hades.<br />I'm not going to delve into the story any more than that, so no spoilers.<br />It is a good two hours of escapism, and fun to watch Liam Neeson, and Ralph Fiennes as Zeus, and Hades respectively chewing up scenery at every given opportunity.<br />Probably the last of the stop motion classics involving the great Ray Harryhausen, the original movie looks laughable in comparison to today's effects, but as we have seen so often, effects alone don't always mean a great movie.<br />Sure to do well at the box office, it is a visual feast if nothing else, and although I don't agree with some of the scathing reviews it's received from the media, and film critics, it did fall short of my expectations. 3.5 Stars.</p></body></html>

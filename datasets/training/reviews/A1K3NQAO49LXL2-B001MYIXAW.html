While everyone who has seen the trailer will know that this is the story of a small snow-bound Swedish town haunted by a vampire, what is truly awesome about it is the fragility of each character, and how they all crumble in one way or another. Eli's sacrifices, Oskar's sacrificies, Virginia's sacrifice, H?kan's sacrifice...  The film is beautiful and minimal, and we care about all of the characters. The love story between two 12-year-olds is somehow quite believable. The theme of bullyism is a bit clumsy, and provides a bit of non-vampire action. The book, apparently, also deals with alcoholism, drug use, and pedophilia - wow, pack it all in between the vampirism and murder.<br /><br />This film is very highly recommended.</p></body></html>

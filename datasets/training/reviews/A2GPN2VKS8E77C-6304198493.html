"And just like that, he's gone." Excellent, tour-de-force performances from everyone. SPOILER WARNING!!! Pay attention to Verbal (Kevin Spacey) in the scene where Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) is yelling at him. SPOILER OVER!!! My only gripe is that Christopher McQuarrie didn't appear in any of the featurettes located on the flip side of the disc (though he briefly appears in the introduction to one of the featurettes). I highly recommend this movie. You'll be surprised. The movie is also very well-written by Christopher McQuarrie and expertly directed by Bryan Singer (both of them would reunite to, respectively, co-write [with Nathan Alexander] and direct "Valkyrie"; please see my review on that equally excellent movie). This movie should have been rated PG-13 for violence and some language.</p></body></html>

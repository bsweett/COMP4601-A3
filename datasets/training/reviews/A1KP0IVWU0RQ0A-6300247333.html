<meta name="summary" content="Pointless remake!"></head><body><p>New Rule For Hollywood= If you can't do something new with it, quit remaking older movies. Without Gregory Peck and Lee Remick this loses most of the power the original had. Other than Mia Farrow's stunning turn as the nanny this is one big waste of time to me. I know others may like it and if you do that's cool, I just can't recommend it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best of 2010, With Some Stunning Performances"></head><body><p>Winter's Bone is one of those independent features released every year that gets massive notice from the general public and ends up on nearly every year-end list of best films. It takes place in the rural Ozark Mountains, showing a side of America we don't often see in films and uses gritty, unflinching realism in this stark setting while telling a genuinely exciting, plausible story.<br /><br />Ree (Jennifer Lawrence) is 17-years-old and responsible for the well-being of herself and her two younger siblings. Her mother sits in a catatonic state and her father Jessup, a meth cook, isn't around much. One day Sheriff Baskin (Garret Dillahunt) arrives to explain that Jessup has skipped bail and has put the family's house up for his bond. Ree vows to find him, but she lives in a town where almost everyone is involved in drugs and hardly anyone wants to talk. The effects of meth are apparent all through the area in both the rundown look of the houses and the weary, worn faces of its population. When even Jessup's brother Teardrop (John Hawkes) refuses to help her find him, Ree must navigate her way through the male-dominated realm of the backwoods to find her father.<br /><br />Although it takes place in the "backwoods," Winter's Bone avoids the stereotypes that generally characterize people in these areas although it seems that nearly every character is related in some way. The film demonstrates very strong characterization in that it doesn't stereotype these people but it doesn't beautify them either. All of the actors look and sound realistic for this setting. Even Ree, the determined protagonist, has only an average vocabulary and though pretty, looks like a girl that has more important things to do than worry about her appearance. Ree is one of the strongest female protagonists to grace the screen in some time. She's strong-willed and determined, but appropriately vulnerable. Roles like this one don't often come along for women, but Lawrence really makes Ree come convincing. She seems to really understand this character and she plays her with the perfect amount of bravado and realism.<br /><br />The film is really well-made, drawing you into the setting with the beautiful photography of absolute poverty-stricken areas and the use of a monotonous color palette. The film uses atmosphere very well to create a mood, but it doesn't emphasize atmosphere over plot. It's a family-drama that also operates as a mystery/suspense film. While I found the atmosphere created by director Debra Granik spellbinding, the plot is very suspenseful and very thrilling.<br /><br />There is one thing that I feel really elevates the greatness of this film that I've deliberately avoided mentioning and that is the revelatory performance by John Hawkes. I'm familiar Hawkes from several movies and television shows, but not until Winter's Bone did I realize the extent of this man's ability. I've read reviews where people will remark that they didn't even recognize an actor until the credits rolled, but I've never personally experienced that until seeing this film. Hawkes proves he's a chameleon and an actor capable of giving a dynamite performance. While this performance hasn't gone completely unnoticed by critics and audiences, it's been widely overshadowed by Jennifer Lawrence.  Hawkes not only brings a great amount of energy to the screen every time he's on it but he takes this character from despicable to ultimately likable. The scene between Teardrop and Sheriff Baskin is one of the most intense scenes of any film from 2010. It is this scene that summarizes why I think Hawkes should win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. It's such an intense, captivating performance. When Teardrops asks the Sheriff "Is this gonna be our time?" It's a mesmerizing moment. Teardrop is a great role as written, but Hawkes brings something so powerful to it. It is Hawkes that made the biggest impression on me. While Lawrence is deserving of the overwhelming recognition she's received, I wouldn't call her performance a revelation. John Hawkes is simply that good.<br /><br />Winter's Bone is an exciting, suspenseful, and enlightening piece of filmmaking that has the capability to please even the most casual film-goer. Some of the most riveting cinematic moments of 2010 occur in this film. Despite the hype, Winter's Bone is not over-hyped...It's simply a brilliant piece of filmmaking, one of the best films of 2010, and it has my vote for the best supporting male performance of that year as well. This film is definitely worth your time.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></body></html>

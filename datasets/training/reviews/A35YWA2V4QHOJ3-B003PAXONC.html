Hard to believe that it was going on 20yrs ago that he was a young Hollywood upstart.  I'm all about giving credit where credit is due, so I will say this:  he has come a LONG way as an actor.  This film, in particular, required a great deal of acting ability, not the least of which because he is the only person on the screen through 90% of the film.<br /><br />The movie is kind of a cross between the TWILIGHT ZONE, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005V9IJ">Cast Away (Widescreen Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004VVNB">Logan's Run</a>.  A "cure" for cancer has caused an airborne virus which has killed most of the inhabitants of the planet.  Most of the rest who have been turned into zombie creatures.  A select few people are immune to the virus.<br /><br />The lone survivor of New York City is an Army biochemist (our man, Will Smith).  He is desperately trying to find a cure for the virus in his basement lab, and his only companionship is found in his dog.  He is able to travel about freely during the day, although NYC has been overrun by the animal kingdom (some of them quite dangerous).  At night he must stay locked up, lest the zombies find him.<br /><br />If you're into end-of-the-world movies and / or zombie flicks, then this one is certainly worth picking up.  It is quite a profound concept in a way:  a zombie flick with a big budget, an "A-List" actor and a very good soundtrack.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sometimes Corny is OK"></head><body><p>"The Holiday" is the kind of film that will stand the test of time and has the potential to be a Christmas perennial.  A real cynic could dismiss this charming flick.  How can you dislike a film that cites the moxy of Irene Dunne and the genius of Ennio Morricone?  Give director-writer Nancy Myers kudos for having the chutzpah to reference classic old movies and making one that doesn't compare unfavorably to them.  Also cite the film's top-flight cast(Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz, Jude Law, Jack Black) who give sincere performances that bely schmaltz.  Eli Wallach nearly steals the show here as an aged Hollywood screenwriter who Winslet befriends.  I initially saw this film after a ragged day of Christmas shopping with my wife.  I liked it well enough but the waterworks were going with my wife.  It's on a second viewing that the film really grew on me and convinced me of it's staying power.</p></body></html>

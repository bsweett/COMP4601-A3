<meta name="summary" content="Captures Napoleonic Naval Warfare"></head><body><p>I found this film to be extremely well-done. Naval combat during the Napoleonic Wars was an extremely unpleasant and bloody business and this movie addresses this aspect. There was a lot of drama form the interaction of the crew and the circumstances in which they are placed. And the acting is excellent. This is a war film which is certainly worth watching.</p></body></html>

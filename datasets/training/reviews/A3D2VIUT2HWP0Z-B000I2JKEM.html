Truly superb voice work by all of the cast, and animation beyond compare. It really is so wonderful that an artist like Burton will invest in a stop motion work of genius, when past-masters like Disney are bailing out to save money( read, make money).<br /><br />The Film alone is worth the price, and the extras give an insight into the film making process, as well as the mind of Tim Burton.<br /><br />Personally I Like Helena Bonham Carter's Character. And her role in this romantic drama, full of emotion, supernatural wonder, and true wonder, is just magical.<br /><br />Well worth a place in any good film collection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Extremely Awesome Film!!!!"></head><body><p>This movie is incredibly funny, and a great tribute to the classic series, in which it is based on. Steve Carell is awesome and hilarious as Maxwell Smart, who works as an analyst for the top secret American intelligence agency, CONTROL. Max wishes to be a field agent. When Max passes his test, the Chief of CONTROL feels that Max's analytical skills are too valuable. When CONTROL is attacked, the chief decides to make Max an agent. His partner is Agent 99, played by the incredibly beautiful Anne Hathaway. Agent 99 does not want to work with Max because she sees him as irritating. The more they work together, the more they like each other. They must stop a man named Siegfried, who plants a bomb at a concert. To make matters worse, Max is accused of being a double agent. He tries to break out, and try to stop the bomb from going off, and save Agent 99 from the 'real' double agent. This movie is filled to the brim with action, and comedy! I highly recommend that you GET SMART!!!</p></body></html>

Imagine some natural, geological or cosmic catastrophe meaning the end of the earth, hence of humanity. The loss of the magnetic field of the earth is one possibility since it has been going down for a few decades and no one can explain. If such a phenomenon were truly happening, the normal reaction would be to bring all scientists around the world together to find a solution. There cannot be any moral and acceptable salvation for humanity, or even a little part of humanity if it does not mobilize everyone, every country, every nation. The film is unluckily hijacked by the military that imposes the vision of some aggressive attack from an enemy. They seem to listen to the scientists and politicians for a while, but at the same time they have their own Plan B ready which is purely military. That is why the military should have no power whatsoever and their finances should be scrutinized constantly, for them not to be able to have their own plans. That's why the finances of the military are supposed to be voted by Congress, but is what Congress votes always clear? Certainly not and that is true in every country. There are some blind or invisible lines hidden in some other budgets. That is revealing about a lack of democracy in our countries: the armed forces are not 100% open to public scrutiny and they do things they have never been allowed to do. The film though takes a clear stand against this and manages to defeat Plan B, thanks to a hacker in the place. We could of course wonder why they brought that hacker into the sanctuary. But for the film he was needed and was able to fulfill his promise. I must say I did not like his nose. Too visible, too outstanding. A hacker is supposed to be absolutely invisible, hence just plain normal, average, banal, in no way conspicuous. Then the treatment of the volunteers in that last chance mission is quite flat after all. A little bit of rage but a lot of positive tension. A situation in which one must sacrifice after the other should create a real tension that could be and become negative, including the absolute loss of all reactivity in an individual who knows there is no way out. But It was a pleasant film after all.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></body></html>

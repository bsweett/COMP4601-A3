I`m gonna be brief: 2 think that it is made 5 years after Hollywood was transformed 2 sound is amazing. The camera moves, the sound is good(as are the soundeffects), the music, the story and most of the actors are all good. The production values? Stunning. Compare it with CLASH OF THE TITANS from 1981 if u don`t believe me. Fay Wray i s a good screamer but not that much as an actress.  After numerous videotapes I now own it on DVD. Of course it is great but it DOESN`t include the "making of". Hmmm. Last friday I watched JURASSIC PARK III and went straight home and saw KONG. Well. Hello? In 1933 they at least had something called WRITERS and story developers. A job that may be overlooked by Hollywood these days. KING KONG? A forever treat though his first appearances is difficult to frighten of these days.<br /><br />On January 16 2006, I bought the color version of this film and I have to admit it. IT`S EVEN BETTER in color.</p></body></html>

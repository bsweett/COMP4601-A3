<meta name="summary" content="Compare & Contrast."></head><body><p>Insomnia will do no harm to the reputations of the people involved in its making. Chris Nolan continues to perfect his skills as a filmaker, Al Pacino gives us another great performance, Robin Williams manages the near super-human task of suppressing his Robin Williamsness (i.e. manic comic genius),and gives a thoughtful and spot-on character performance, and Hillary Swank does nicely in a supporting role. The thriller is taut and complex and takes place in a new and interesting setting.<p>Too bad there was an original movie of Insomnia, that takes place in Norway, that has much of the same elements but also some great differences. If one has seen both, the comparisons & contrasts are impossible to avoid. Al Pacino gives a terrific performance as the bleary-eyed sleepless detective, but Stellan Skarsgard in the Norwegian version is no slouch at acting either.<p>I won't go into detail on the changes and diversions in both films. I recommend that movie buffs see both, as they are different films, despite sharing relatively the same story. <p>I find the European version is more enigmatic, not drawn in bold black and whites, and with a feeling of life's quixotic accidents. The central crime/cover-up by the detective is motiveless in the Norwegian version, in the American film there is an added subtext that either deepens or makes simpler the detective's actions, depending upon your point of view. The byplay between the murderer and the detective is more complex in the American, and more subtle and less defined in the European. Pacino is a man with troubles, Skarsgard is a troubled man. <p>But finally, the big difference is in the ending. I was disappointed that the American version opted to end everything in a typically American fashion, with a bullet, and all strands wrapped up in a bow. The American film is inexorable and predestined, the Norwegian film more open to happenstance and accident. The European version leaves the end enigmatically unresolved. I won't say which is best. That, each viewer will have to decide for themselves.<p>Both versions are well worth your interest.</p></body></html>

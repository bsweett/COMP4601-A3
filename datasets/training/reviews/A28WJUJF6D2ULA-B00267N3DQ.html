<meta name="summary" content="Great Film, Bad Ending....Seriously."></head><body><p>If it weren't for its ending, I'd say this film was absolute onscreen perfection. By this I mean it has ALWAYS seemed so hugely wrong for Snow White to throw off the dwarfs and all the little forest creatures who saved her life, and run off with the Prince. Without even an onscreen goodbye? That's some cold stuff there. Think what her departure must've done to her friends there in the forest. Seriously callous.</p></body></html>

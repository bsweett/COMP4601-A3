<meta name="summary" content="Not as great as it could have been, but still great"></head><body><p>Romantic comedy with stellar cast. Jack Nicholson plays himself, an aging Lothario chasing younger women. A heart attack lands him in the seaside home of the mother of one of those young women. This 'mother' turns out to be Diane Keaton, a playwright of some fame. An interesting little triangle develops. Keanu Reeves, the cardiologist, falls hard for Keaton, who is always one sexy dame. Nicholson falls for her, too. Keaton is in the enviable position of having 2 men, who have maybe a 25 year age gap between them, salivating over her.<br /><br />The scenes of the developing relationship, including a nude scene for Keaton and a bare-butt scene for Nicholson, are marvelous fun and quite believable.<br /><br />The there are detractions. Frances McDormand's talents are wasted in a role as Keaton's sister, a role that is far too small for her. Reeves' role is understated, gentlemanly - and ultimately unbelievable. Not unbelievable in terms of a man falling for a woman 15+ years his senior, but unbelievable in terms of the minimal emotional range he brings to his performance.<br /><br />But the best part by far is the fact that this romantic comedy doesn't deal with the foibles of 20-30yo actors; it focuses with truth and affection on the foibles of a 'mature couple.'<br /><br />Great theater.</p></body></html>

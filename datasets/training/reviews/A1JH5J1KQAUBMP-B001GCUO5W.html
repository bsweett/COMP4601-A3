Suffice to say that I was engrossed by the masterful direction (Martin Scorsese), the intriguing setting, and the magnificent cast (which includes Ben Kingsley and the always delightful Max Von Sydow).  However, I also felt that the film did not play fair with me.  Early scenes set the stage in such a way that I felt cheated by certain revelations that came later.  While those revelations did give an added dimensions to some plot points that had seemed incongruous, they also seemed to open some holes in other respects.  I will probably watch this film again someday, and it may very well improve on a second viewing.  At that time, I may find myself wishing that the editing feature on Amazon reviews allowed us to change our star ratings.</p></body></html>

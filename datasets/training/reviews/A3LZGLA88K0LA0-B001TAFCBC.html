<meta name="summary" content="WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO THE REALITY OF THIS MOVIE"></head><body><p>..it's pretty lame.  In spite of all the kudos this movie has received, ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is one of those "artsy" movies that brags on its own originality, but fails to really address the issues at hand:  you may be able to erase a person's memories, but you cannot erase the feelings that person has.  This is proven not only in the main storyline with Joel and Clementine, but in the secondary plot featuring the impressionable Mary who thinks that the work of her idol Howard is so wonderful.  We later find out that her heroic doctor has been "playing" her like a fiddle, too.  We first meet Joel as he skips a day from work and goes off on an adventure where he runs into the blue-haired Clementine.  There's the slightest hint that they've "met before", and by the time the opening credits roll, we see a disgruntled and angry Joel finding out that Clementine has had a procedure done to "erase" her memories of Joel and she's on to a new life with a new boyfriend.  A hurt Joel decides to have the procedure done, but as it is being performed, he finds his memories aren't as awful as the thought and he tries to stop the procedure.  Of course, by the end, both Joel and Clementine realize they made a mistake in having the procedure done, but we also realize that even though they want to try and make it together again, the same things that caused them to split in the first place are still there and they will more than likely appear again.<br /><br />I didn't find the script all that enticing, it's manipulative and much of what goes on is predictable and forced.  As for the acting, Jim Carrey takes a dramatic leap but I found myself thinking, "This is Jim Carrey trying to show us he's a serious actor and not just a manic Ace Ventura."  Kate Winslet's performance, while professionally done, pales in comparison to her work in "Finding Neverland," and she should have gotten her oscar nomination for that film instead of this one in which she merely seems to be "acting."  Elijah Wood looks painfully out of place in his role as the lovestricken Patrick, again like an actor who is saying "Don't just think of me as Frodo."  Ironically, it is in the performances of Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkinson, that the heart of this movie is evidenced.  Ruffalo is marvelous as the programming geek with the hots for an unsuspecting Dunst; Dunst, meanwhile, uses her adolescent charms gamely and does a real reversal when she finds out what's happened to her; and Wilkinson exudes a calm confidence and vulnerability as the mastermind behind Lacuna, which is the memory erasing company.  The film offers some great visual effects as Carrey's memory is being erased, but by the time the deed is done, so much posturing and padding has crippled the movie.<br /><br />I'm sure all of the afficionados of this vastly overrated film will hit their "No" buttons by now, but as always, it's not whether one agrees with the film, but if one can find something that helped them make up their own minds about this movie.  I found it too manipulative and artsy.</p></body></html>

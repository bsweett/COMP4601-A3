<meta name="summary" content="Go get 'em, Red"></head><body><p>Working with a near perfect balance of action, humor and charm, the first of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F7MSFW">Hellboy</a> series to reach the big screen is a highly entertaining flick. While Ron Perlamn's effective performance as the gruff but warm hearted red monster centers the film, he is surrounded by a phalanx of supporting actors that give "Hellboy" its broadened success.<br /><br />In particular, John Hurt as Hellboy's father figure caretaker, Dr Bloom, exudes a strong intelligence and sense of purpose to avoid his character being a scientist cardboard cutout. Rupert Evans plays a befuddles new handler, newly exposed to the top-secret paranormal agency that Hellboy dwells in. Add some angry Nazis and one p-o'd rasputin who want to destroy the world, and you have a firecracker of a fun film.<br /><br />Written and directed by Guillermo Del Toro, the script pops at all the right moments all while adding character touches. The action sequences are a rollercoaster of thrill and scare (and the box of kittens is a hoot), along with a terrific visual sense. Even Jeffrey Tambor's sourpuss gets a good lesson in accepting the unusual before the film ends. For fans of the resurgent comic book movie genre, "Hellboy" hits all the right notes.</p></body></html>

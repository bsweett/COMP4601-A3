<meta name="summary" content="One of the most entertaining films I've seen"></head><body><p>I have to start by saying I'm fairly biased about this film.  The original was one of my favorite movies, and I grew up reading the comics religiously.  That being said, I do feel I would be able to give it an unbiased review if I didn't like it, but thankfully, that was not the case.<br /><br />Spider-Man 2 is Sam Raimi at his best.  I've never been in a theater where I've felt an audience have so much fun at a movie.  This film had everything: incredible special effects, great dialogue, romantic themes, plenty of action, and some decent acting.  When I first saw the trailer for the film, I thought the special effects looked a bit shoddy, but the final release was amazing.  Everything was seamless, and the attention to detail was very noticeable.  One of the best parts aspects of this film is the comedic elements.  I didn't expect to laugh going into Spider-Man 2, but it pleasantly surprised me and I found it more humorous than most comedies.  The humor is very subtle and some of it is campy, but doesn't come off poorly.  It's great watching Parker trying to deliver pizzas in his costume to meet a deadline, or being forced to use an elevator and make small talk with the other occupant.  Raimi fans will also be pleased with a few Evil Dead II references, and one 30 second scene in a hospital realy stood out and showcased his talent for the horror genre.<br /><br />Raimi captures the essence of Parker so much more closely in this film.  The Parker in this film is given a closer focus on the fact that he still experiences much of the flaws that every other New Yorker has to go through.  From having to live in a run down apartment, to never having any money.  Too many Super heroes come from wealthy backgrounds and have an unlimited supply of money, but Spider-Man is just a below-average teenager who's given an incredible ability. And this is why he's so identifiable and likeable to the audience.  As I said, Raimi does an incredible job of showing this and I couldn't believe how closely the film version of Parker matched the bumbling science nerd I grew up with in the comics.  In addition, comics fans will love this film for all of the hidden references that are stacked in the movie.  There's a cameo of creator Stan Lee, a photographic reference to a famous comic panel of Spidey taking of his mask, oft-quoted lines from the book, and Dr. Connors and John Jameson appear, who feature into the comic very prominently.<br /><br />It does have a few faults, albeit they're hard to notice.  I found that some of Maguire's lines came off a bit forced, which I noticed in the first film.  Franko is also a little stiff as Harry Osborne.  I didn't notice any bad acting, but nothing I would consider Academy-worthy either.  There was also a subplot about a physical problem with Parker that felt out of place in the film and wasn't developed very well.  But it made for some really incredible scenes that I wouldn't want removed.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the best films I've seen in a long while, and accomplishes that rare feat of surpassing the original.  There were two or three specific events at the end of the movie that really blew me away and that I wasn't expecting, and will make for some very interesting sequels.  As a long-time Spider-Man fan, I can definitely say this movie is very fulfilling, and I would recommend it to audiences of any age and type.</p></body></html>

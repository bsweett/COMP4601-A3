But "Cinderella Man" has about as much heart as that movie and I think can have the same emotional effect of "Million Dollar Baby", though "Raging Bull" it is not, but does it need to be? No.<br /><br /> Yes its true the movie does use plenty of cliches, we get the swelling music at the movie's more sentimental moments, and the sometimes cheesy dialogue, but I went along with the movie and got choked up at all the right moments. In this sense "Cinderella Man" belongs in the same class as Howard's other films such as "Apollo 13" and "A Beautiful Mind" which reteams many of the same people besides Russell Crowe and Howard. The film was written by Akiva Goldsman, who also wrote "Mind" and is produced by Brian Grazer as well.<br /><br /> "Cinderella Man" is based on the true story of James J. Braddock (Crowe), a fighter who at one time was the lightweight champion until losing the title, in what was described as a beating for Braddock. Sadly though that fight is never shown on-screen. After the depression hits, Braddock takes fights that don't draw much of a crowd, and those that do show up are disappointed. Most people feel the guy is all washed up. One of his fights is declared a "no contest" as the crowd starts to boo cauing Braddock to lose out on that day's pay. But Braddock has to keep on going, despite what people may think of him because of his family. His wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) supports him in her own way, which is by never attending a fight. She says each time Jim takes a hit, it's like she's taken one too. Now how original is that line, I ask you? And then there is their three children, two boys and a girl, that they just can't support. One of the boys actually steals some food for them. But then one day Braddock is given a second chance in what was suppose to be his swan-song fight. He goes up against the number two contender for the heavyweight title. And thus starts his comeback giving a down and out nation hope.<br /><br /> That story may sound an awful lot like the 2003 film "Seabiscuit". Apparently there were a lot of heroes during the depression giving people hope. If there was so much hope going around, why do we always see such sad people? Both movies tells us the story of the underdog. How one man (or horse) was given a second chance and when that was given the country backed him. He bacame a symbol of the times. A down and out man in a down and out time who tried to fight back and work his way up. Isn't that the American story? People with nothing, if they come to America, will end up with something, usually debt, but that's another movie.<br /><br /> I'm kidding though when I take some jabs at this movie. I'm really down playing my admiration for the movie, because I feel you don't want to read a review that's going to do nothing but praise the movie. You probably want something more objective. But the movie does have a lot to recommend. Crowe is quite good in the movie. He has played heroes before, people who have fought the odds against them in movies such as "Gladiator", "A Beautiful Mind" and "The Insider". So Crowe seems suited for these type of movies. I also liked Howard's directing. As I said before, yes he uses some cheap tricks on us to gain our sympathy, but they work. I didn't feel as if the movie was throwing too much at us. At its heart "Cinderella Man" is really just an old-fashion story about finding the American dream. It's a movie for those who say "they don't make 'em like they use to". This proves they try once in a while.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Possibly one of the year's best film. Effective performance by Crowe and Zellweger, who pull on our heartstring for all they are worth. The movie ranks up with Howard's best films including "Apollo 13" and "A Beautiful Mind". Strongly recommended.</p></body></html>

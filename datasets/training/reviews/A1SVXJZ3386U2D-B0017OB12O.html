<meta name="summary" content="The Greatest War Movie of All Time"></head><body><p>In my list of the top ten movies of all time there is a place for  &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;.  This movie has just about everything; great acting, great directing, great music, great cinematography, a great, multi-layered story line, and a message for all humanity.  The great acting includes William Holden who brings his usual swagger to his character.  However, the audience finds themselves focussed on the acting of Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa and their mental chess game of a struggle for power.  This aspect of the movie would qualify for greatness by itself.  The cinematography is outstanding and underscores much of what the director tries to bring out.  This is one of those movies worth seeing on the big screen if you can find a theatre that shows old(er) movies.<p>The story essentially involves British POW's having to build a bridge deep in the jungle of Burma.  The Japanese prison commander is insistant that officers work along side their men.  The British commander refuses to alow this to happen.  This is the chess game between Guinness and Hayakawa.  An American POW (Holden) escapes towards the beginning of the movie and is drafted to return to the POW camp in a guerilla action to destroy the bridge.  During this 160 minute film, there is ample action, plenty of sub-plots and a lot of brilliant symbolism.  My favorite is a gun battle between the guerillas and a Japanese patrol deep in the jungle.  We have an early glimpse of a number of sleeping bats as the scene develops.  When the action starts, the gunfire disturbs the bats who blacken the sky as they come to life.  This imagery of turning peace into chaos is itself symbolic of the ultimate anti-war message of the movie.  The idea of the British soldiers building, with misguided pride, a bridge in the jungle only to have it destroyed upon completion is a message about the pointlessness of war.  The brilliance of this movie is that it can be enjoyed equally by WWII buffs and anti-war protestors.  Each time you watch it you pick out a little bit more than you saw before.  If you haven't seen this movie, you've been cheating yourself.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the 3 best thrillers/action movies of 2007!"></head><body><p>The movie is tense from the beginning till the end. It's also bloody. There are only 3 actions scenes but they're very realistic because of 2 things listed below<br /><br />1. Whoever was shot died instantly because he was shot multiple times.<br /><br />2. After a person was shot and dead, the camera focused on him for a very short time then it moved to another person/area. In reality, this is what a soldier does. If he spends too much time to focus on the person he just shot he might be shot by the enemy! However, this makes it's hard for the viewer to clearly see how a person died. I had to watch the movie 2 times before I could see all the details of the fighting scenes. For some people, this might be a turn-off.<br /><br />To me, it's still one of the 3 best thrillers/action movies of 2007. The other two are Transformers and AVPR (Alien versus Predator Requiem)</p></body></html>

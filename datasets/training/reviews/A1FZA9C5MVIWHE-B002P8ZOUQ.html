<meta name="summary" content="this is where Wolverine got his start"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed this movie. it was a bit odd to see Professor Xavier walking. I thought he would have been in a wheelchair in this movie. it was a bit odd to see Cyclops going to school as a teen and Gambit on here as well. this movie has tons of action. Hugh Jackman reprises his role as Wolverine, who was a Weapon X. it is hard to imagine, through all the X-Men cartoons I watched in my 20's, that Wolverine and Sabretooth grew up as half-brothers. there were some funny parts in this movie, such as Fred "Blob" Dukes boxing with Wolverine, however, eventually, it is the Blob that gets knocked down. I am really surprised that Magneto and Mystique were not in this movie. I recommend this movie to X-Men fans.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly terrible"></head><body><p>He has the vision and the skill, but the lack of an actual plausible plot killed this movie and perhaps Shyamalan's reputation. It is unfortunate because you can tell he really does try to make a good film. The trailers were very effective and the premise interested me, but man, what a letdown. Truthfully, the first 3/4 of the film were actually pretty darn entertaining. There was mystery and tention, just a great buildup. But then, the end happened, or uh, didn't. Simply put; one of worst endings in the history of films. No joke. It was just awful and I was so mad for days after. I felt cheated. There are no words to describe what went wrong, because I have no idea what M Night was thinking when he wrote this script. I'm just so confused. It litereally ruined what could have been a really decent flick. The rest of the film was null and void because of this atrocious ending.<br /><br />One other major thing that irked me throughout though was the acting. I was horrified by how terrible the actors were. ALL of them. Mark Wahlberg was ridiculous as was John Leguizamo. It was bizaar. Just truly bad at times, down to the laughable facial expressions.<br /><br />This was for me, easily, the worst Shyamalan film to date.(I have yet to see Lady in the Water...)</p></body></html>

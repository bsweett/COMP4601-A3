When he arrives, Lime is not there to greet him. Apparently, Lime was accidently killed after being hit by a car, and their &#65533;meeting&#65533; is at his funeral. The one discrepancy that bothers Martins is that in the official report, two men were said to have carried Lime from the street to the sidewalk, still alive at that point; but an eyewitness claims not only was Lime killed instantly, but another man--a third man--helped carry him. Martins, curious of the accident, begins to investigate and hears contradictary stories about the circumstances surrounding Lime&#65533;s death.<br /><br />Exactly how did Harry Lime die? That question is the engine driving the plot. The film constructs a picture of Lime through the comments of all those who knew him. Martins remembers Lime as a loyal friend. Lime had a girlfriend named Anna (Alida Valli), who speaks very highly of him. After all, he was the man she loved, and apparently still does. Anna&#65533;s unquestioning devotion paints the picture of Lime as a romantic. There is obviously something likeable about him, given the attitude Anna has for him and the way the tenants in the rooming house feel, but Calloway (Trevor Howard), the British officer in charge, says Lime was an evil man and advises Holly to take the next train home. He shows Martins the effects of Lime&#65533;s work in a hospital full of children dying from the watered-down vaccines that were part of the dead man&#65533;s &#65533;business enterprise&#65533;.  <p>This all makes for a fun, entertaining and intriguing thriller that may be implausible, but will keep you on the edge of your seat, anticipating all the twists that keep coming!</p></body></html>

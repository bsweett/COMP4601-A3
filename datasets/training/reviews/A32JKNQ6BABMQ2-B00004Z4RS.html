<meta name="summary" content="x-men 2-the greatest comic movie ever!"></head><body><p>amazon only lets us review one part of a whole set so theres a better chance youll buy more stuff if you like the first review.i guess theyre more interested in $ than the freedom of speech and not ripping off its customers.so im going to review them both right here.in part one,wolverine who has acute senses,admantium blades and a extremely fast regenerative power is hurt and rescued by the x-men who are a team of highly evolved people with extraordinary talents.he was with rogue when he was recruited who can touch people and see there thoughts  and drains mutants abilities.thier leader is professer x.one of the guys from star trek.he is insanely telepathic.while there at mutant school,he meets cyclops with eye lasers and jean grey who also does the telepathic thing.theyre enemies are magneto who controls anything metal,sabretooth-a cat like he-man,toad with a very long and powerful tongue.like 4 or 5 feet and can throw people.magneto has a special machine that could suck all mutants powers into his captive rogue and then take over from there.a battle goes down up top the statue of liberty.then in the second part,which i give 5 stars,another bad mutant who works for magneto named mystique uses nightcrawlers9a good teleporting mutant]body to attack the white house so the x-men will get the blame.magneto who is trapped in a plastic prison pulls the iron in his guards blood to rip him apart and escapes.the guy who aided his escape is a big shot goverment type who wants the mutants dead.his son is a mutant who can control otheres minds.but the dad can control him with a special machine.so they try to use the kid to control professer x into using his cerebro invention to kill all mutants.theres a big fight,blahblah blah.mystique is totaly naked except for blue dye and little rubber suction thingys allover her body.sabretooth is played by the lucha libre star taylor mane.thats spanish for professinal wrestling.they are both good but 2 is way better.jean grey is a semi hot red head.if the creators really wanted to go over the top spectacular with this set theyd finish telling the story.jean grey does come back as an extremely powerful mutant called phoenix.she is powerful enough to take over the world but doesnt want to since shes good.but then she gets turned into the dark phoenix.also ,there are many many cool characters not even explored yet.theres juggernaut-a giant kind of like hulk but smarter.apocalypse-a more powerful and giant version of the t-1000 from terminater 2.giant robotic mutant hunters called sentinals.the blob-a giant fat guy whose mirth absorbs most any blow.longshot-a good guy who has incredible luck all the time.archangel-with paralytic darts and razor wings.the beast-more agile than spider man,genius and colored a lot like sullivan from monsters inc.havoc-he can concentrate something and blow stuff up.even a mountain if he really really tried.gambit can charge things and use them explosively.bobby drake from part 2 later becomes a far more powerful ice man.firestar who shoots fire.a lot like pyro in part 2.there are many many more too.at least 30.they even travel to the future for numerous outstanding stories.my point being,while both of these movies rock!they could make at least 3 more totaly awesome ones and a whole string of sequels some even involving psycic vampires and the like.wolverine did the best acting in part one but was outshined by pyro in the 2nd one.pyro can control flames.ie:in one scene he lights a lighter and uses it to blast a team of cops away so he can escape.that scene was the best scene of both parts.there is this subtle ww2 minority rise up against the white kind of undertone but its  expected with hollywood.in the best scene i talked about,wolverine gets shot in the head at point blank,hits the ground and is up within a minute.i guess the only star is the dude from star trek.so these are his 2 best movies.all his others suck.the special effects are very cool.pyro and nightcrawler put on some dazzling displays.ive already given some ideas for sequels but will recap.1-apocalypse vs the x-men,2-the dark phoenix saga,3-time travel to the vampire world of the future,4-sentinals vs the x-men,5-time travel story where the x-men are eventualy betrayed and wiped out by a friend,and even when the battled kang who in the very distant future rules the world and sets out to conquer all time!i give the real deal and the real deal is if you dont get all this and more youre getting screwed.</p></body></html>

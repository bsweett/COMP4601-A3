<meta name="summary" content="Are you really sure all that glitters is gold?"></head><body><p>This film has deserved the prestigious nomination and notable distinction - at least to my view - to occupy a relevant place in the recent production of the cinema.<br /><br />The result has been amazing. Not only this gem movie captivates and engages the most exigent viewer from start to finish. At the end of the projection you experience that cathartic magic of the cinema, because it's the cinema paying a priceless tribute to itself. It is the eternal ritornello that many times before we have heard it: the cinema is a dream's fabric An universe of illusions, where the spectral shadows and these twenty four shots by second personify and represent a dramatis personae.<br /><br />An illusionist Eissenheim, attracts the whole attention in the Vienna of the late years of the XIX Century. He met in his early adolescence the love of his life, his personal muse. He will focus himself around the illusionism as a way to make his life and astonish the world through his undeniable gifts.<br /><br />The careful photography in sepia, the marvelous shot angles, the effective camera work and the presence of a magnificent and inspired cast supported by a bewitching script, literally seduce us and invites to participate with this talented and novel director Neil Burger of one of the most original and surprising works around this interesting issue. I must confess that since Istvan Szabo's Hanussen, I had not enjoyed of such lavish achievement.<br /><br />Special kudos for Paul Giamatti (who is demonstrating step by step without making too much noise, to be one of the most talented mature actors at this moment) and Edward Norton who makes a convincing role. The employment of the iris in the epilogue of the film  and the special and that little but smart detail of the hat and that sardonic laugh is an extraordinary device that crowns a film made with good taste, fertile imagination and profound love for the cinema.</p></body></html>

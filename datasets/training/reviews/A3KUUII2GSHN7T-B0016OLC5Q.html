<meta name="summary" content="Sean Penn is at last legitimate."></head><body><p>Yes, I can objectively say this is the best film I've seen all year, and its ending, if you are a feeling person to any degree, will stick with you for a long while. Even as I sit here typing this review, I am moved by the closing five minutes and the story that led up to it.<br /><br />Despite a few shots of full body nudity and a few scenes of foul-mouthed discourse, I found 'Into the Wild' to be almost a holy experience, as if God was somehow accentuating the risk of wanderlust, as well as its difficulty acquired reward, while at the same time showing us that true living consists of the relationships we forge. That's the feeling I came away with, and this feeling can be attributed to Mr. Sean Penn, the director of the film.<br /><br />Penn brings to life the tragic tale of Christopher McCandless in a way that I doubt even the best in Hollywood could manage. He takes Krakauer's book and molds a film that somehow waves its petite hands at Hollywood's big brother blockbusters and defeats them with ease. My God, what a wonderful film, and a soundtrack that beautifully augments the film! Penn captures both the beauty of McCandless' trek across America and the sad, horrifying realization he comes to in his final moments.<br /><br />Perhaps more importantly than anything else, Penn pushes the human relationship to the forefront and defines love by an ability to forgive those around us. This point is stressed by McCandless himself as he realizes the lesson in his desperate and lonely final days.<br /><br />Seize the chance to watch an Oscar winner before the legions of Saw fans realize it even exists. If you do, you will witnessed one of the great films of our generation, and perhaps one of its greatest, most tragic and profound stories.</p></body></html>

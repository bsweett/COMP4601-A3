<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful experience of virtual reality"></head><body><p>When I first saw this film in a theater, I wasn't sure I liked it.  The CGI was incredible, especially the hair of the various characters and the textures of the fabrics--Santa's bag was an incredible and very real velvet.  Yet the thought of small children being "picked up" by someone, without the knowledge and consent of their parents seemed a little creepy, despite the unlikely presence of a train in their front yard, and not the best model for behavior.  With exposure, however, the film takes on more of the aspects of a roller coaster ride and while exciting is not quite so creepy.  Even the ghost becomes less threatening with time.  I would suggest, however, that parents discuss the dangerous issue of going with anyone unknown to them for any reason whatsoever with their children after the film.<br /><br />The color and quality of the film are incredible.  Almost anything that can be done with a computer seems to have been done here.  The lifelike quality of movements was exceptional; my favorites were the sudden and very purposeful movements of the animals:  wolves, a herd of elk, an eagle and Santa's reindeer.  The movements of hair and clothing were also wonderful.  The eyes of the various characters, however, seemed a little too staring and gave the faces a wooden aspect, so this is still in the realm of the sophisticated cartoon. The real character of specific objects was also very varied.  Without knowledge of context, the sleigh bell in the final scene would be almost indistinguishable from a real bell.  Yet much of the train and other items were business-as-usual cartoons.  Similarly, while some people were almost hyper-real, others were simpler cartoon characters.  Contrast with the conductor, who looks very much like Tom Hanks, and the engineer and coal stoker, who were totally Saturday-morning cartoons, was at times a little jarring.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed in the fact that so many of the parts were played by Tom Hanks.  While he is undoubtedly a gifted actor, it seemed that there might have been greater dramatic variety if the interpretations of the different characters had arisen from seperate individuals.  The children's roles were wonderful; and their singing voices exceptional.<br /><br />The most incredible and exciting scenes--and certainly those that illustrated the great potential of computer generated virtual reality--were the roller coaster-like trips down steep inclines on the train and the slipping sliding trip across the lake of ice.  One had the same sensations from viewing the film as one might have had actually undergoing the real experience.  I was totally impressed.<br /><br />The story is a perennial one, the loss of belief in "magic" by the young.  Though simple, almost everyone has been there in their time.  One almost might say that the whole story was based on the adult wish to prolong their own children's belief for a little longer--perhaps even their own, at least for the duration of the film.  Altogether, the exciting adventures, the comraderie of new friends, and the wonderful message of belief in the spirit of the holiday made the film a great success for me.</p></body></html>

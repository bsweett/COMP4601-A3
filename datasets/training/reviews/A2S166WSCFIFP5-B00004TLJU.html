<meta name="summary" content="classic"></head><body><p>The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti western. This is the one everyone remembers. It's shot in Spain, where the terrain looks similar to the American west, but gives it its special feel. The cinematography is a beautiful job. Ennio Morricone's score takes on the aspects of another character in the film, and it has become synonymous with the american west. this is an all time classic. great film, i love the fact that there is no dialogue for the first 10 minutes of the film. really shows what movies are meant to be. the dvd also contains about 15 minutes of footage deleted from the u.s. version (it's in italian). <p>this is just one of those movies everyone loves and everyone should own.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="TROOPERS is Excellent Sci-Fi"></head><body><p>STARSHIP TROOPERS is high on my list of excellent sci-fi films.  Man battles Bug!  It is so rare when special effects, story, and sci-fi elements come together -- usually a film relies too much on one and is not balanced by the others.<p>TROOPERS is also a wickedly funny film.  Hats off to director Verhoeven for his twisted sense of humor.  The killings that happen during the coarse of the film are lightened by this humor.  I howled when a dead space-body bounced off a starship's cockpit window.  Verhoeven also drops in hilarious &quot;Public Service Announcements&quot; throughout the film -- my favorite features some twisted kids taking pleasure in squashing cockroaches on the pavement.  Hilarious.<p>The film does not take itself too seriously.  The actors are appropriately heroic and attractive.  It's almost like the SAVED BY THE BELL cast went into the SPACE ACADEMY!<p>The effects (LOTS of bugs killing LOTS of troopers) are very cool.  The sound effects are wonderful on the DVD!<p>All-in-all, STARSHIP TROOPERS is a wild sci-fi ride, done very well, with some humor to push it along.</p></body></html>

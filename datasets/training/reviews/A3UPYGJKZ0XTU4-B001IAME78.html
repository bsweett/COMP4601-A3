<meta name="summary" content="Strong Portrayal of Bruce Banner in This Attempt to Reboot the Hulk Franchise."></head><body><p>"The Incredible Hulk" is not a sequel to Ang Lee's lackluster 2003 film "Hulk" but a reboot of the Hulk franchise that introduces a slightly different backstory. Dr. Bruce Banner (Ed Norton) exposed himself to gamma radiation while working on a medical research project for General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), who, unbeknownst to Banner, intended the research to create an enhanced soldier. When the experiment turns Banner into an enraged green Hulk, he is forced to flee Gen. Ross, who wants to dissect the beast and propagate its enhanced physique. Having eluded capture for five years, Banner is compelled to return to the U.S. to retrieve data from his old love and research partner Dr. Betty Ross (Liv Tyler). He has been communicating with a scientist calling himself Dr. Blue who may be able to use the data to cure Banner's condition.<br /><br />Be sure to watch this backstory play out over the opening credits. This is an economical way for director Louis Leterrier to set the movie up, but audiences could miss it. This film is a well-conceived and relevant adaptation of the Hulk comic from screenwriter Zak Penn. Like "The Incredible Hulk" television series of 1978-82, it emphasizes Bruce Banner's fugitive status and his constant battle to control his emotions. Edward Norton makes a good nerdy scientist who is, nonetheless, determined and resourceful. The audience really feels for his predicament, which is the film's great achievement. And, for most of its duration, Banner acts like a person would really act in his situation, lending credibility to a story that obviously stretches it. Liv Tyler is a little to breathy to be a cell biologist, but she plays well with Norton and Hurt.<br /><br />I found this Hulk, who is voiced by none other than Lou Ferrigno, more affecting that the cartoonish version in the 2003 film, but still not entirely lifelike. Ferrigno and Hulk co-creator Stan Lee also make brief appearances in the film. The final confrontation between the Hulk and the Abomination runs too long, but "The Incredible Hulk"  shows promise as a new franchise. I look forward to the next episode. It's a good cast, and the themes of a man struggling to control himself and another striving to bend nature to his will are compelling, thought the latter might have been more explicit.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2008 single disc): The single disc edition contains 5 deleted scenes, 1 extended scene, and a feature commentary with director Louis Leterrier and actor Tim Roth, who plays Emil Bronsky, a soldier employed by General Ross to capture Bruce Banner. It is a conversational but constant scene-by-scene commentary, sometimes with Roth acting as an interviewer. They share their recollections of filming, and Leterrier comments on locations, supporting cast, his intentions with each scene, and what he added that was unscripted. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in Spanish and French.</p></body></html>

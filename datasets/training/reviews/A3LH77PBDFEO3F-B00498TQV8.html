It is a modern tale of life for mountain folk, who live by old codes, with new demons. Great great story for adult audience. For those who enjoy this may I also encourage you to watch a depression era movie about a different set of mountain folks <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059TGF">The Winter People</a>both movies are available on Video on Demand or DVD.</p></body></html>

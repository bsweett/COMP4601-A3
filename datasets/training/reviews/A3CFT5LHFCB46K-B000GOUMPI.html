<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick's masterpiece of horror"></head><body><p>The Shining is as still frightening today as it was when it was made. Not as much, but it still is. Jack Nicholson plays one of his best performances as Jack Torrance, winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel along with his wife (Shelley Duvall) and their son Danny (Danny Lloyd), who has a special gift (The Shining) that can allow him to see things others can't and talk to people without moving his lips. In addition, a cook also has the Shining. <p>The film proudly shows the style of the late Stanley Kubrick everywhere in the film: Scenes that take place in a bathroom (Three as a matter of fact), very clean rooms with white floors, three-way conflicts, long shots, up-close shots, and a story of dehumanization. It also shows Kubrick's sense of humor, which includes sarcasm (When Jack talks about Danny's knowledge of cannibalism "...You see. It's okay. He saw it on the T.V!") and black humor (A butler with a head injury holds up a glass and says  "Wonderful Party, isn't it?" There is also a seen before HERE'S JOHNNY! when Jack says "Honey, I'm Home!")<p>The Shining is one of Kubrick's best films and one of the great horror films of all time. If you haven't seen it, you're missing a wonderful party!</p></body></html>

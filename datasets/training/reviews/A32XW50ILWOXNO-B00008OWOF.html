<meta name="summary" content="Fraud, charm, Walken and the real return of DeCaprio"></head><body><p>"Catch Me If You Can" is a genuine throwback, made with a light touch and finger-snapping charm, featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, finally, in a movie star performance. If he hits a down note as 1960s con artist Frank Abagnale I'd like to see it.<p> Director Steven Spielberg, too, gears back his tendency to pile on the portent, although there are few scenes of thick soup drama that seem to jar us out of our enjoyment. Mostly, however, "Catch Me" is an easybreezer about a kid who finds the one thing he does well, does it with extraordinary ease, and eludes the entire FBI mail fraud division for years while he does it. The highest-concept script floating around Hollywood couldn't tell a better tall-but-true tale.<p> Frank Abagnale was a kid of above average smarts with a slick, quick-thinking businessman for a dad (Christopher Walken) and a mannered, spoiled French mother (the estimable Nathalie Baye). When Frank Sr. gets tagged by the IRS, his wife swiftly sours on him and gets a divorce. That sets up a scene where, on the spot, Frank Jr. has to decide where, and with whom, he'll live, and Frank Jr. bolts, beginning a five-year run of check fraud unlike anything before or since.<p> The movie better explains the mechanics of just how Frank Jr. rips off Pan-Am Airlines, his chosen victim for the stunning no-questions-asked treatment afforded pilots at the time. Later, he becomes a doctor in Georgia, then a lawyer in Louisiana, where his run nearly ends when he gets involved with a rich girl (Amy Adams) and decides to marry.<p> On Frank's "tale" is FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) a straight-arrow investigator with a better taste for magnetic ink than human relations. Hanks personally asked for the role, and he makes a nice, determined foil. "How else do you think this is going to end?" is his standard line to Frank. A kinship develops, the kind of kinship between two acknowledged, lonely professionals on opposite sides of a business, and when the game comes to a final close, Carl goes a mile -- and further -- for Frank when most "kinder" agents would have let the chips fall where they may.<p>  Frank Jr. also tries to keep a tenuous connection with his father when he can, and Walken, in a few scenes, essays a broken, disillusioned man just about as well as an actor can. Frank Sr. barely hides his seething under the polish of his false optimism; Walken, as usual, gives his lines an ever-changing, jazzlike cadence; his performances are mysteries all themselves. He's beautiful in this movie. <p> And look at DiCaprio! So cautious in both "The Beach" and "Gangs of New York," Leo seems to have refound the confidence the groove he flaunted in his early career. The role suits him -- DiCaprio still looks like a boy, so playing young is easy -- and it may, in fact, turn out to be one of his best roles. DiCaprio, because of his face and voice, will always struggle with movies on the other side of the track; better he should play to his good looks and his easy-to-smile demeanor. Frank Abagnale is a Cary Grant/Jimmy Stewart kind of guy, and DiCaprio can be their heir, should he want the mantle. "Catch Me If You Can" is a hell of a start.</p></body></html>

"I want to direct."  When the actor is Robert Di Niro, (certain to be surrounded by adoring Yes-Men), the results can be as frightening as an exploding cigar or poisoned martini.<br /><br />The Good Shepherd is a true "cameo-fest," no lesser a light than Joe Pesci gets about 5 lines (although they are memorable.)  Alec Baldwin was probably done his scenes in half a day.  (Di Niro himself provides a listless shuffle-on.)  While Jolie, Turturro, Gambon, Hutton, and Hurt are around a bit longer, none are around long enough to help.<br /><br />Di Niro also shows us his Hollywood juice through funding; the film is beautifully produced, time and place are evoked exceptionally well, clothes, cars, interior design, all done with great care.  Why then is The Good Shepherd longer than a Sunday afternoon double-header between two last place teams?  For starters, the run-time is a shockingly self-indulgent 167 minutes, pushing the 3-hour envelope.  For another, absolutely nothing happens.  It would be tempting to blame this on Matt Damon, (still unconvincing when playing an adult, much less an adult in a position of authority), or on Eric Roth, who wrote the screenplay.  But Damon, as the "anti-Bourne," is clearly doing what's he's told, and Roth's screenplay might have been good had it been significantly tightened.<br /><br />As readers of John Le Carre know, the actual work of spies, the tradecraft, is extremely boring.  The fascinating aspect of their world lies in the personalities of these people, their emptiness, their loneliness, their complete inability to trust, their facility with lies until they arrive at the point where they're barely able to believe themselves, and the devastating emotional toll all of this takes.  Carre's work walks you through this inner landscape in a way film never can, because film is a visual medium, and watching a stone faced Matt Damon for the better part of 3 hours tells us nothing - which is rather the point - his ability to reveal nothing serves him well as a spy.<br /><br />Di Niro gets an "A" for hubris, he strong-armed a lot of "names" onto the set.  And he gets an "A" for ambition, it's a complex story of inner turmoil, difficult moral choices, layers of deception, and the clash between idealism and pragmatism.  But he gets an "F" for implementation and direction, averaging out to a "C."  Where The Spy Who Came In From The Cold succeeded because of its laser-sharp focus; bloated scope and lack of character insight cause The Good Shepherd to resemble the Bay of Pigs.</p></body></html>

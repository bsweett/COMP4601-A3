If that happened, the whole cinematic experience would become lame.  If you could remember the first volume, it was depicted in many styles and I was happy to inform you all that the second volume was a continuation of that.  Quentin said it well that whilst first volume was paying homage to the Eastern elements and second volume was paying homage to the Western elements.  The soundtrack was done by Robert Rodriquez (of Marichi's fame) and it fitted this movie very well.  For (violent) movie enthusiasts, I couldn't say this enough, this movie was made by someone who was passionate about his craft!  For those that missed Quentin's dialogues as we witnessed in Pulp Fiction, we gotta see heaps in this offering.  As David Carradine explained in the behind-the-scene, Quentin's movies were never about violence but providing us with an insight of how bad people ticked.  Thus, his willingness to partake in this project.  Gordon Liu was back second time around to play Pai-Mei (a bad arse kung-fu master who taught the Bride her martial arts skill).  This movie contained a lot of surprises like cameo appearances by the least expected persons, additional footage if you are willing to wait to the VERY end of credits, and we got to find out the real name of the Bride's name!  Highly enjoyable and truly watchable.  You would be crazy to miss this one.  Strictly for the Quentin's fans only</p></body></html>

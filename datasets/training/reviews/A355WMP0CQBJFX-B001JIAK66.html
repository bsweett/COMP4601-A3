<meta name="summary" content="WHAT A MONSTER TREAT!"></head><body><p>van helsing was a very enjoyable movie. i liked it. having all these monsters put together in one movie was a good one. nicely done. the makeup and special effects were great. the fact that hugh jackman was the lead was a very good choice. impressive acting and very believable. strong character. he made this movie all the better. as for kate beckinsale, she played her role well. good actress, and giving us a taste of what she has to offer. a story where monsters are a common thing. dracula, his ladies, frankenstien, dr.jekyll and mr. hyde, and the werewolf are thrust together. in creepy transylvania where all of these monsters reside. van helsing(hugh jackman) is called upon to take out this evil clan. just another mission, just another monster, but this one is a lot stronger. dracula who needs frankenstien to help him to get his babies to live. without him, all attempts fail, and they die. he wants to rule and take over. he must be stopped and frankenstien wants no part in it. anna is a vampire killer and her family has been for a long time. they must continue to kill them until there is no more left so that they may live in peace and continue on to heaven. they meet when van helsing kills one of draculas ladies. he is the first to have killed a vampire in years. thus they must help each other. all the while emotions get involved and makes for an even better picture. then annas brother gets bit by a werewolf, and so he bites van helsing. who will eventually turn into one as well, unless they retrieve the antidote. anna never expected her brother to become that which they killed. she is the last of her line. she must fight until her mission is complete. they come upon draculas home, where the action continues, and anna must fight like never before. the only way to beat dracula is to get bit by a werewolf. well lo and behold van helsing will become one. nice fight scene in the end. great stuff. these kinds of monster flicks do it for me. the ending should have been different, but at least anna and her family found peace at last. and frankenstien was free, and van helsing having loved will continue on to be a different man.</p></body></html>

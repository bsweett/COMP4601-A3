<meta name="summary" content="Spoiler free review -- A decent small-town zombie survival flick -- 3.5 out of 5"></head><body><p>Not having seen the 1973 original, I can only comment on this remake in relation to other recent works in the survival horror genre. To give credit where credit is due, George A. Romero is widely regarded as the father of the zombie genre and the original (and little-known) Crazies was probably fresh for its time. This version of The Crazies comes nearly 40 years later and definitely doesn't bring anything new to the now-crowded zombie buffet table. It is sticks to an old formula and delivers some solid thrills, without any surprises or deviations from the well-worn path set by other zombie movies. If you've seen the Resident Evil films, 28 Days Later, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AR0D4A">The Mist (Two-Disc Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray</a>] or played any of the games in the Resident Evil series or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3AADE">Dead Rising</a> (inspired by Romero), you'll already be familiar with this film's premise: unnatural disaster strikes small-town America. A plane carrying a deadly cargo crashes in the woods, releasing toxins into the water supply of a small Iowa town. Instead of Raccoon City with the T-virus, it's Ogden Marsh with another virus. Different names, same results. People get infected and the military comes in to contain the infection.<br /><br />What follows is a relatively straight-forward zombie survival flick as the three main characters try to flee the town while evading the military. The survivors are Sheriff David Dutton, his deputy Russell, and David's wife Judy. Structurally, the film is very similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPUN">The Invasion</a>, another remake, and a bit like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DZOC3W">The Happening</a>. People start off exhibiting emotionless vacant stares then become crazy and go about killing others. There is a lot of graphic violence, blood, and gore in this film, including trucks, morgues, and meat lockers full of corpses, but viewers used to zombie video games or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006SSOHC">Saw</a> series will be in familiar territory.<br /><br />All the townsfolk are pretty much disposable, without much character development. We don't get any depth to them, so it's easy to see them zombified and dispatched. The military, likewise, is also a nameless, faceless group that's just another enemy in the film to run away from. The origin and purpose of the government virus remains a mystery, and the ending quite obviously points to a sequel.<br /><br />At 90 minutes, it is short, inconsequential, throw-away entertainment that doesn't ask too much of audiences. While Timothy Olyphant turns in a good performance as the sheriff, I didn't feel like I gained or lost anything from watching this film. There are a few cheap tricks like sudden loud music and pop-outs, but for the most part, the scares are honest. Overall, a solid zombie movie that will entertain if this is how you're looking to spend movie night.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A decent horror film with a few good surprises.."></head><body><p>Saw 2 is a fairly good sequel, a serial killer called "jigsaw" kidnaps people an forces them to take a deadly test - usually involving cutting off a body part to survive.<br /><br />This time around jiggy kidnaps a bunch of people, including a police detective's son, and imprisons them in a death-trap rigged house. The detective tracks down jigsaw only to find out that, well , I won't spoil it. There are some good surprises in this movie, one that is very obvious, others that are pretty clever.<br /><br />One of the better horror films to come out in recent years.</p></body></html>

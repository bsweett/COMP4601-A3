A good script, a sensible plot, and flawless casting make this film a surprising classic.  Even the subplots were gems--although you see Captain Havlock (Bernard Fox) for three scenes, he is a lively supporting character with his own soul and story.<br /><br />Fraser was able to pull off a credible Indiana Jones-type character, while still maintaining his own adolescent playfulness.  I am glad that the directors and the producers let Brendan be Brendan, and thus differentiating this film form the other 1930's era films:  The Phantom, the Shadow, and Sky Captain.<br /><br />This film is a delightful mixture of seriousness and comedy, horror and humor, capped off by tongue in cheek playfulness--reminiscent of the Ghostbusters or Kolchack.<br /><br />There are only two drawbacks to this film. The first is that they went a little too wild with some of the CGI, specifically the slack-jaw expression of the mummies.  It looks funny the first time, but is too hokey.  They keep their shape, but do show some yellowing with age.<br /><br />The other issue is why they called this The Mummy.  The Boris Karloff classic is it's own thing, and bears a superficial resemblance to this film.  As a fan of black and white films, it certainly would have cleared up things if I could talk about the Golden Age of Horror film without confusing the uninitiated.  Then again, if you do not call the film The Mummy, what would you call it?</p></body></html>

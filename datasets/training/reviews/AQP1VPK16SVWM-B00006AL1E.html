<meta name="summary" content="Terrific trilogy of timely sci-fi entertainment"></head><body><p>Sure there have been time travel stories before but none quite like this. Suppose you could go back into the past and see your parent's yearbook in action? Suppose your mother developed a crush on you? Finally, suppose your dad was a dweeb and your mission is to somehow make him into a hero. That's what happens to Marty Mcfly (Michae J. Fox in his star making role)all within the span of a couple of days. <p>When Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd in the past and the present)creates a time machine he does it with style; Brown refashions a Delorean sports car with his flux capacitor which allows it to travel through time. It's an ironic touch given the short life the Delorean had as an auto and the futuristic touches on the car itself (i.e., the doors that open up and away from the car like wings, etc.) Brown's plan is to travel to the future but through a terrible series of events, Brown isn't sent anywhere--instead Marty Mcfly his teenaged friend flies into the past.<p>The film is a mixature of both timeless (the Reagan is President line still creates chuckles) and dated (Pepsi Free is long gone) comedic touches. Luckily, there's a visual reference to the soda earlier in the film that helps make the joke still work (if you can catch the brief reference). Steven Spielberg once referred to Back to the Future as the ultimate Leave it to Beave episode with a sci-fi twist.The script by long time collaborators Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis is packed with visual and verbal jokes that keep you on your toes. The zany direction by Robert Zemeckis is witty and manages to bring out the best comedic side of all the actors involved. It both captures the best elements of Zemeckis broad approach to comedy (as in Used Cars) and builts on that foundation with sly wit and satire (like in Forrest Gump)<p> Although it appears that Michael J. Fox's performance is little more than an extension of his persona, he actually does wonders with his role. He breathes life into a character that could have been a one-note shrill performance. The entire cast is compendable in roles that are a challenge. Lea Thompson manages to portray both the girlish charm of Marty's mom as a teenager and the resigned disappointment of her in middle age.<p>The transfers are generally very good although I noticed in the first film in particular that some of the sequences are quite grainy. I'm not sure if it was the film stock, transfer or the print but it's not all that distracting unless you watch it on a big screen television. It's note a huge problem just a blip that doesn't prevent you from enjoying the film. The second and third films look a bit better and have less grain/compression problems. Perhaps it was more noticable for me because I had previously viewed the film on laserdisc.<p>The commentary by producer/writer Bob Gale and interviews with Gale, Zemeckis, Spielberg and others are enlightening. You also have the option (like Spiderman) of allowing 150 factoids about the film to pop up throughout the feature. Watch it the first time without the facts.<p>The second film traces Marty's attempt to undo the changes in time created by Biff. Biff in the future manages to get ahold of a book that presents baseball results from the past 50 years. He goes into the past via Doc Brown's Delorean and gives it to his younger self. The result is a sleazy future dominated by Biff. Marty and Doc Brown must undo the damage and return the future back to the way it was. The plot is a bit complex compared to the first film. Marty actually goes into the past and sees himself living the first film. He has to do so, though, without altering that visit and setting the future right again. It provides great comedic fun particularly when he does go into his own future and witnesses what happens to himself because of his short temper.<p>In the final part of the trilogy, Marty goes into the past in search of Doc Brown to prevent his murder. Again, the anarchisms of the past/present/future provide considerable comic relief. Although it's not as sharp as the first film, the plot is streamlined compared to the convoulted second film. The third film works a bit better because the audience doesn't have to concentrate on the complex plot (as in the second film)and is already familair with the set up (put forth in the first film). It's not quite as imaginative or innovative as the first film and lacks the visual style of both the first and second. Nevertheless, it's fun and manages to both hold your interest and entertain you at the same time. A note of trivia about the second and third films. They were actually shot back to back to save money on the budget. This was the first film shot in that fashion and, although it's quite common place now to do this (Lord of the Rings for example), it was both quite daring and innovative at the time. Daring because if the second film tanked, Universe Zemeckis and Spielberg would have been stuck with another turkey.<p>The packaging is great with a nice little booklet that includes comments from cast and filmakers. Additionally, the extras also include outtakes, bloopers and a few surprises you'll want to find out about yourself. 5 Stars for 1, 3 1/2 stars for 2 and 4 stars for 3. The extras deserve 4 1/2 stars as well.</p></body></html>

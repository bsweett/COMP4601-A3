<meta name="summary" content="3rd time released  & Artisan finally gets it right  16:9 DVD"></head><body><p>This review is primarily explaining this Remastered HDTV 16:9 5:1 Dolby digital Ultimate Edition / Directors Cut, 2 DVD Set presentation!!<p>Artisan is notorious for re-releasing their DVD over & over again each time giving us more fluff in its DVD package (not necessarily the picture or sound quality).<p>Case in point "STARGATE - Ulitmate Edition Director's Cut.  This is their 3rd release of "STARGATE" and they FINALLY got it right! (what takes Artisan so long to release the movie right???  Never the 1st time (SO BUYER BEWARE)  NOW on their 3rd try they have provided us with a worthy outstanding presentation!!!!  <p>Note: If you are a Home Theatre Owner with HDTV WideScreen 16:9 you must be cautioned about your DVD purchasing.  First WideScreen (Letterbox) DVD's are not going to be true WideScreen on your 16:9 HDTV.  Letterbox means just that - horizontal & vertical black bars around a very small centered WideSceen picture.  Second true WideScreen as this "STARGATE - Ultimate Edition" is indeed a true HDTV 16:9 (as noted on the DVD Ultimate Features)picture giving the complete expanded presentation.  Finally remember the only true HDTV WideScreen DVD will be noted on the Extra Features Section as 16:9 WideScreen Enhanced or Anamorphically Enhanced (DVD will automatically adjust to TV size).<p>"STARGATE" the movie itself is a scifi classic weaving ancient Eygptian theories with scifi. Brought to us by Erich von Daniken, author of the renowned book "Chariots of the Gods".  A very imaginative movie with great screen acting (Kurt Russell & James Spader), outstanding special effects and a very fascinating complex story.<p>This "Ulitmate Edition" is awesome!!  Here is what you get; Newly REmastered 16:9 WideScreen - the picture is absolutely fantastic), A "DIRECTOR'S CUT" - additional extended scene footage allowing us to know more about this fascinating world of "STARGATE", Original Theatrical Cut - so you get two versions to compare!! (Director's Cut wins hand down), Digtially ReMastered Sound - 6.1 DTS & 5.1 Dolby Digital - Awesome, Featurettes: Is this a STARGATE? - a great explanation of aliens visiting earth etc., The Making of STARGATE - includind never before seen behind the scenes video, Audio Commentary - great backgound information about "STARGATE", Production Notes, Cast & Crew Information & Theatrical Trailers.  Wow, what a great DVD package.  Artisan finally gets it right so now I can pass on my old inferior versions to friends so they can at least get a taste of this great scifi epic.<p>Now I can say buy "STARGATE" and sit back & ENJOY the ride over & over.</p></body></html>

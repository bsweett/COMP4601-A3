I found myself cracking up every couple of minutes or so. I kinda liked Meet the Parents, but to me this sequel is much funnier and the the addition of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand make it a real hoot. It does go a little overboard on the raunchy factor (especially for PG-13), but all the gags got a laugh out of me. I may be in the minority here, but I would say this is the funniest comedy I have seen all year.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mostly funny, with some great dialogue"></head><body><p>Most of this is funny when it is supposed to be, though a few elements here and there fall flat.  There is also some good dialogue, although sometimes the actors' delivery and timing could have been better.<br /><br />Imagine waking up in a hotel suite with a live tiger and chicken, a crying baby, bottles everywhere, a missing tooth, and a missing friend.  This is what happens to the hapless goofballs who threw a bachelor party in Las Vegas just a few days before a wedding and then had no recollection of what happened on that night of heavy drinking and drug use.<br /><br />Not for kids, certainly, but okay for some adult laughs.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="PLEASE REMASTER THE THEATRICAL VERSION SCARIEST MOVIE EVER!"></head><body><p>OK This is not only one of the scariest movies ever made, it's also one of the best! As much as I love the spider walk segment, I prefer the original theatrical version of the movie way more than this version. This movie is scary as HELL and needs no embellishments! Please release the original version re-mastered on DVD! If you haven't seen this film and call yourself a Horror film fan, you haven't seen one of the few truly scary films in the history of film making. Try this one late night by yourself with the lights out with no one in the house! If the hair on the back of your neck isn't standing I don't know what will get a raise out of you!</p></body></html>

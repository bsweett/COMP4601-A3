<meta name="summary" content="One of a kind movie"></head><body><p>Movies based on best-selling books are a risk in Hollywood as fans of the book often have high expectations and can grill a movie if it does not satisfy them.  The makers of the Harry Potter and LOTR movies generally pleased the book fans, whereas the makers of Troy, Dinotopia, and War of the Worlds have not pleased the book fans.  This being said, making a movie on a controversial book is an even greater risk, and The Da Vinci Code is probably one of the more controversial books to appear in the English language in the past 10 years.  But the makers of the movie did their homework alright.  First, they gathered a good cast of actors and actresses, including two of the best in Tom Hanks and Ian McKellen.  Second, they made sure to use actors that reflected the nationalities of the characters in the book.  Third, they picked a great composer to make an original soundtrack.  And last, Ron Howard was a great choice as a director.  The result is one of the best movies of 2006.<br /><br />I have never read the book, but I can say that this movie is very engaging and interesting.  The story starts with the killing of an important person who knows a very important secret.  The rest of the movie proceeds as a series of secrets being unraveled, with the audience finding out as the protagonists find out.  The movie ends with the female lead discovering her true identity, and the male lead finding the final resting place of Mary Magdalene.  In between are many well-done episodes of suspense, action, comedy, and drama.  The dialogue is quite good and shows each character to have a depth of experience and a complex range of drives and emotions.  The special effects are also quite good, and at numerous times, flashbacks are made to important acts in history.  These look quite impressive.<br /><br />This DVD set comes with multiple special features including interviews with all the principal actors and actresses.  There are also features on the soundtrack, the book, and of course, interviews with the book's author.  All in all, this was one of the best movies of 2006.</p></body></html>

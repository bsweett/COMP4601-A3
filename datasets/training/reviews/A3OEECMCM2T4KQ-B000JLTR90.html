It should go without saying that all his films are unusual leaning towards the supernatural and fantastic, touching upon subject matter such as earthbound spirits, alien invasions, an indestructible super-man, the notion of fear itself controlling us and in Lady in the Water, a bed time story turned adult fantasy about the necessity of the human being to become more aware and change for the better.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti (Sideways) plays the leading role of Mr. Heaps, the landlord of a large apartment complex, a caring man who has made it his sole purpose to take good care of his tenants though later in the film, we discover his true purpose and why he is off his true path. Giamatti is an excellent actor, able to do comic roles and true pathos with utter believability.<br /><br />Bryce Dallas Howard (The Village) as Story, the Narf who arrives from the world of water to the land of the human in order to move the human on the correct path towards positive change is perfect in this role. Howard's pure innocence as the Narf came across as genuine and her vulnerability almost visceral as the evil monsters that hide in the grass stalk her and attempt to drag her away and destroy her.<br /><br />In fact the entire cast played their roles with enthusiasm and all seemed as actors, to really enjoy doing this film with Shyamalan.<br /><br />To make an observation, all of Night's films except maybe The Village, have a similar underlying theme. That theme is the individual discovering their true purpose in life and following that purpose. In this film he expands on this theme writing the purpose for the entire cast in the form of the desperate mission to enable Story to leave our world without harm. This was very clever and worked well in the film.<br /><br />M. Night Shyamalan is a gifted writer. He is not only a gifted writer but a hard working one with an eye on perfection. It is known that he begins with an idea, jotting down sporadic notes, creating an outline and then to write several drafts to end up with the final draft. In Lady on the Water, he wrote 13 drafts before he was satisfied.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film. My fascination and study of Fairy Tales might have something to do with it however; standing alone, Lady in the Water is a wonderful story with a positive message.<br /><br />An excellent film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great action movie"></head><body><p>This movie was everything I hoped it would be. Some movies I see the trailer and thats all that was good about the movie, but not this film. Hell, I saw it twice. The PG-13 rating kind of made me rethink seeing it but I did anyways.  There was a couple behind me who wouldnt shut up all the way thru it, but I still enjoyed it. A few parts didnt really fit with the story, but im not a nerd who picks at those kinds of things. Its a great addition to the series. John may be older and swear less, but the action is really heavy and there are a few good laughs thrown in. The best action movie of the year so far and probably all year.<br /><br />I also want to predict something. When this movie comes out on dvd, it will probably be given the unrated edition. I honestly dont know what they could add to the movie, it was perfect the way it was.</p></body></html>

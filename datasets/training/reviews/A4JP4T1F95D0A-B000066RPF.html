<meta name="summary" content="Five Star Movie"></head><body><p>This movie is terrific in every way.  It is truly a timeless comedy that can make me laugh 25 years after having first seen it.  I do with though they they would remaster the movie and give a better looking film to show.  This looks like a vhs version copied to dvd.  I purchased this movie after going to see Spamalot on Broadway.  Spamalot is worth a trip into New York City, the funniest Broadway shows I have ever seen.  I didn't even realize that I didn't have a copy until I came home to look for it.  They have put out several editions at various prices depending on how many extras you really want.  I stuck with this version since it has plenty of bonus materials.  This is truly a comedy classic.</p></body></html>

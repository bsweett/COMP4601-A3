<meta name="summary" content="Not the best of British horror by a long shot"></head><body><p>28 Days Later was one I skipped in theaters because I won't see any more videos badly blown up onto 35mm because some director's convinced himself it looks better than film while the studio saves a few bucks on processing. I'm glad I did, because judging from how bad it looks on DVD it must have been nigh on unwatchable on the big screen. Close-ups are fine, but anything more than a two shot and the lack of depth and detail (not to mention the problems with any straight lines that are anything other than perfectly vertical or horizontal) is a major irritation. The major casualty is any sense of scale - with the long shots looking so horribly flat and lifeless, most of the film is played in medium shots, which means in effect you're watching a TV show with worse picture quality than you'd get on a game show. Rather than the sense of immediacy the makers claim, you're just left at a distance from much of the film because you're too busy squinting to try to work out the background detail.<br /><br />The film itself is utterly predictable in every way - you know who'll die, what the plot twists will be and exactly where and when they'll happen - but aside from the substandard visual quality and the fact that it's basically 'No Blade of Grass' with zombies, it's actually pretty good until the finale, when Cillian Murphy goes all Rambo on squaddies and `infected' alike. Despite the horrible miscasting of David Schneider in the opening scene, the performances are very good, especially the erratic Brendan Gleeson as a London cabbie, which helps raise the bar. It's just a shame that the videography has such a deadening effect on the film.<br /><br />If you want to see a really good British horror movie, however, track down Neil Marshal's The Descent instead.</p></body></html>

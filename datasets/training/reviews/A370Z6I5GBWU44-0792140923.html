The writing and storytelling is wonderful, and so is the acting! You get lots of great names here - Tom Hanks, Sally Field, Gary Sinise... wow! This is not an action-packed tale of good guys vs bad guys or anything like that, but wow, it's still an awesome film!<br /><br />It follows the life of the titular main character through his childhood and adulthood (as narrated by Forrest Gump) while various people sit with him at the bus stop and listen to him. There's plenty of interesting things and events in here - his time in Vietnam, his tenure working on a shrimp boat, etc etc. If you like action, this might not be a good film for you, but if you like a good story, then definitely give this movie a try!</p></body></html>

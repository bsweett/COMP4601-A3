<meta name="summary" content="A big surprise for a sequel. (Pt. 2 of 7)"></head><body><p>While many were expecting The Chronicles of Narnia to be flops as films, no one would have expected the first instalment to be on of the highest grossers at the box office. Now with the second installment of hopefully 7 films the world of Narnia takes on a very different shape.<br /><br />The same actors who played the Pevense children are back to reprise their roles, but Narnia itself is no longer a world filled with fantastic creatures and magic. 1300 years after the defeat of the White Witch Narnia has been taken over by a ruthless leader who wants Narnia to be a...normal place. A place that will appear just as bland and ordniary everywhere else. It it now up to the Pevense children to return an rescue Narnia from this new menace and discover the true king of Narnia, Prince Caspain.<br /><br />I was very surprised by this film. Much like the first Narnia film it was not an incredible movie, but it was just as enjoyable and the atmosphere was a little more dramatic and mature. There is a lot of dramatic sword fights and meaningful moments between the characters and the new roles are played well by actors such as Eddie Izzard and Ben Barnes. Now we have to see what the next film will bring. There is new leadership for these future projects now that Disney as given the project to Fox. I am hoping that the rest of this story keeps the same elements that made the first two movies enjoyable.</p></body></html>

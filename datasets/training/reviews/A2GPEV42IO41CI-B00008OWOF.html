He uses his wit and creativity to live the good life, successfully posing as an airline pilot, physician, and lawyer, and cashing millions of dollars in bad checks, all before he is 18 years old!<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio is utterly convincing as teenager Frank Abagnale, Jr. His considerable poise and confidence charm us immediately. Tom Hanks plays the stalwart FBI agent who chases Frank for years, forming an odd bond with him. Christopher Walken plays Frank's troubled father in his typically eerie style.<br /><br />Director Speilberg recreates the fashions and look of the 60's well and the script is riveting. There are many surprises and some chuckles along the way, although I consider this a drama, not a comedy. This is a very enjoyable film about an amazingly resourceful young man. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Don't Get Me Angry....Finally""></head><body><p>No longer weighed down by the angst and downright boring emotional drivel of the Ang Lee vision, "The Incredible Hulk" allows the big green angry guy to flex his muscles a bit more.  I'm sure there are some fans out there who enjoy their Hulk with tears and a blanket, but I believe that most fans really just want to see him smash and crash his way through everything.<br /><br />Edward Norton takes the purple pants from Eric Bana and gives us a more convincing portrayal, albeit in limited screentime, of Dr. Banner. Also in a limited role is William Hurt as General Thunderbolt Ross.  While he does a sufficient job, a part of me longed to see Sam Elliott back in the role.  Tim Roth provides the film with a villain in the form of Blonksy.  Liv Tyler takes on Betty Ross, but, as with the rest of the actors in this film, has limited screentime compared to the big green one.<br /><br />The story finds our hero (Norton) hiding out in South America and trying to learn how to control and/or cure his emerald alter-ego.  When the military finally catches up to him, though, the story's pace quickens and features a chase that takes us from a college campus to the city streets.  Hulk fights through sonic weapons, helicopters and automobiles and uses a few jeeps, chains and whatever else happens to be nearby as a weapon.  In short, the meat of this film is action, and fans of action will go to bed after watching "The Incredible Hulk" with a full stomach.<br /><br />Light on story, heavy on action and plenty of nods to the classic Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno television series make "The Incredible Hulk" a big improvement over its big screen predecessor.  There are also a few blinks of what is to come in the future "Avengers" film.<br /><br />Is "The Incredible Hulk" perfect?  No, but it's still an excellent film.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

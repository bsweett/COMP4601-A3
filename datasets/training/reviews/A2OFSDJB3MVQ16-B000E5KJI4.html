<meta name="summary" content="Petersen's majestic Troy"></head><body><p>I previously owned the HD DVD copy of this epic but traded it when I heard that there would be a Directors Cut which would be an improvement on the previous one as far as the video. If you're a fan of this film as I was, then I would recommend this epic whole-heartedly. Some of the dialogue is a little too contemporary for a film of this type and Diane Kruger seems somewhat wooded as Helen but a great beauty nevertheless but Pitt and Eric Bana do excel as the rivals in the war and they're supported by a fine cast of veteran actors such as Brian Cox & the great Peter O'Toole.  This film doesn't quite fall in the classic status like "Gladiator" but nevertheless Wolfgang Petersen has delivered an enjoyable, entertaining epic with awesome battle scenes that DeMille would be proud of.  Definitely a must if you have a HDTV that is 50" or more!!</p></body></html>

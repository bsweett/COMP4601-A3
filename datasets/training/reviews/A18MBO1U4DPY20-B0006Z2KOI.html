<meta name="summary" content="Some liberating dialogues. Overall, not good enough."></head><body><p>I must start by admitting my lack of knowledge on the South American countries, an oversurging dyslexia and my bankrupt knowledge on capitalism and communism. The film has two characters who set out to travel on a bike. They run into a zillion charactes, most of whom made me twich and cringe. The central character is a nice guy, his not so fat friend is supposed to be fat and the more masculine of the two and less liked. What unites them is their daunting sense of adventure. That's the story for you.<br /><br />The film has no strengths worth writing about in my review. I liked the Black Jack scene for one. I've mentioned some weaknesses but overall, I felt the film was too self-indulgent, maybe because it was subtitled but I've seen many foreign language films and dealt much better. I avoided this film for a long time. I presume some of you reading this film have done the same. My sincere advise - DO NOT WATCH unless it's on HBO or on MGM in the year 2021.</p></body></html>

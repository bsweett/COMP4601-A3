<meta name="summary" content="this is just right !!!!!"></head><body><p>a touching, whimsical tale of love at first sight. poor isolated oscar is a well meaning good kid who just doesnt seem to have friends. he is the perfect patsy for bullies everywhere. since this isnt an american movie, the bullies are not that cruel. shoving, name calling and ear plucking is the norm. try as they may, oscars tormentors cant seem to break his good natured spirit.<br /><br />but what do you know, ocsar has a new neightbor. eli and her uncle/chaperone move into his apartment building in the ''dead'' of night. right off the bat they seem to be made for each other. shes new and hes lonely. their meeting is so sweet and innocent you almost forget people are going to die. i mean, eli IS vampire so......<br /><br />im not going to say much on the killing part except to say its done tastefully and is far from gratuitous. the gore makes sense and is done well. some may hate subtitles. they fixed that here with american voice-overs (im not a fan of that, it tends to feel artificial. ill gladly read along).<br /><br />my gripe is this is so good, hollywood will probably redo it and [...] it up. or even worse; the director wanting to cash in and do an american version ala ''funny games''. what an utterly complete waste of time that crap was. anyway, this is a fantastic little movie with no explosions, trendy soundtrack or an all star cast. for those making movies on a shoe string budget, this is an example of how its done.</p></body></html>

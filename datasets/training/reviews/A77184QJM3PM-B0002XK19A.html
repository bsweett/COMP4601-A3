I felt the whole thing dragged along, until the few action sequences, which were short. The CGI, in my opinion, really wasn't too great, some scenes were just too un-realistic to carry alot of weight. One problem I had with the first film which carried over to this one through most of it was Peter Parker shutting out Mary Jane, "for her own saftey". Was I the only one in the entire world who felt this was totally rediculous? The second film, at the end, seemed to resolve this, until the last fade-out. The look on Mary Jane's face left me with an unsatisfied feeling. I felt Doc Ock to be well-done and well-acted, but the descent into insanity seemed a bit contrived and fast. Overall, the study of what a person must sacrifice for an ideal is touching, but perhaps too deeply involved here. This is a superhero movie after all, not a session on a shrinks' couch. Hopefully the third film in this series will better display what spidey fans have loved about the charactor for years, and be a worthy film at the same time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The performance of a lifetime!!"></head><body><p>The movie is a sad and depressing look at the life of Aileen Wournos, one of the most notorious serial killers in American history.  As we see her slow desend into her murderous rampage, we also see what her life was.  Raped at the age of 8 by a family friend, forced into prostitution to make ends meet and then finally kill a john in self-defense.  We see that she had the chance to straighten up her life.  Unfortunately, she had no choice but to go back to the life she lived before because no one would give her the chance.<br /><br />Never have I seen a better performance in the last 40 years.  Her performance is one for the ages, right up there with Marlon Brando, Bette Davis, and Katherine Hepburn.  Charlize Theron is an amazingly beautiful actress.  The transformation into the character in this movie is incredible.  She is barely recognizable!  In addition to Theron, Christina Ricci gives a great performance and has blossomed into a great actress.  Those who are not familiar of Wournos' life should look further by reading "Lethal Intent" by Sue Russell or her autobiography in print or the DVD documentary by Nick Bloomfield.  This movie is unforgetable!</p></body></html>

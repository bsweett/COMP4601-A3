To my dismay I could not figure out what all the big fuss was about. I emphasised with these characters as I or anyone who has ever been in a relationship could feel their pain. Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) is the one who wants to throw it all out there and go for it, he's not afraid to say 'I Love You'. Ennis (Heath Ledger) is reserved and can't allow his head to follow his heart. That sounds awfully like traits that heterosexual people have too. Ang Lee does an absolutely fantastic job with his character's development and the astounding scenery in which this all happens. The bond that both of our lead characters have is truly beautiful and pure. 1963, mid America, work is scarce and two farmhands are hired to tend to sheep on a remote mountain. I believe everybody who hasn't seen the film know the rest. The character driven story is held by a tremendous young cast of actors. Gyllenhaal puts himself up there to become a great leading man in Hollywood, Anne Hathaway has become the new Reese Witherspoon and in time assuming she stays on track will become a leading force. Michelle Williams has left James Van Der Beek crying into his Pillow back in Dawson's Creek as she has now come into her own. Finally Heath Ledger, by far one of the most powerful performances he has ever produced. A complex, engrossing portrayal, Ennis presents himself as a more conventional male stereotype than Jack, so the tension between his masculinity and his sexuality is all the more demanding. A career best from nearly the whole cast.</p></body></html>

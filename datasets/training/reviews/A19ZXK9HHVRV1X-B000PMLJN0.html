Probably the most famous theatrical movie on that subject has been 1975`s "Magic," with Anthony Hopkins as the puppeteer haunted by his anthropomorphized wooden sidekick.  As with clowns, these creepy ersatz-humans have become a source of dread for many people - and moviemakers have been quick to exploit that fear.<br /><br />The latest such endeavor is a movie entitled "Dead Silence," which features Ryan Kwanten as a young man who, one fateful night, finds an anonymous package, containing a ventriloquist's dummy, sitting on his doorstep.  Before one can say "Charlie McCarthy," the doll has done away with Kwanten's unsuspecting wife, with the young man himself the prime suspect in her killing.  In an attempt to prove his innocence, Kwanten heads to his hometown to investigate the legend of Mary Shaw, an old crone of a ventriloquist who met with a mysterious and untimely end a few decades earlier.<br /><br />Despite its derivative nature, "Dead Silence" has enough creepy moments to make it a passable outing for the less discriminating horror movie aficionado.  Director James Wan and his screenwriting partner, Leigh Whannell, don't do anything with the dummy we haven't seen a million times before, but, let's face it, the murdering-ventriloquist-dummy sub genre is a fairly restrictive one by its very nature, with not much room for innovation contained within its rather strict parameters.<br /><br />Kwanten makes for a bland central hero, though Donnie Wahlberg nicely fleshes out the role of the cynical and completely wrongheaded gumshoe assigned to the case.<br /><br />Considering that Wan and Whannell are the filmmaking team behind the vile "Saw" films, "Dead Silence" is surprisingly tame in the gore-and-dismemberment department, with little graphic violence to spoil the mood.</p></body></html>

Kirsten Dunst's acting is spotty - varying from good to unbelievable to horrible. This film was pretty bad - the storyline was flimsy, historical facts were adjusted or conveniently eliminated, the ending was anti-climactic, the acting from the rest of the cast was mediocre at best. The only exception is perhaps Joan Cusack, but her performance is so brief and hardly her personal best. The soundtrack was highly inappropriate and actually detracted from whatever goodwill the movie managed to generate with its outstanding sets. Furthermore, the one thing that must be said about this movie is that the costumes were exceptional and rightly Oscar-nominated. In the end this is hardly surprising - it says a lot about the movie when the shoes (Manolo Blaniks) are more likely to be discussed than everything and anything else about the movie.</p></body></html>

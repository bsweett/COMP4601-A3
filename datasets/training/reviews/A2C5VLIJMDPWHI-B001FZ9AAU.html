<meta name="summary" content="Completely Stunned That I Liked the Movie"></head><body><p>If not for my mother being hell bent on seeing this movie on Mother's Day, I probably would've never seen it. I'm not big on superheroes, fighting crime, and action movies (unless it involves speeding cars), but I sat through this movie patiently to please my mother. However, somewhere along the line, it stopped being about my mother, and the movie grabbed my interest. This movie took an interesting spin in an updated way by making the plot about a weapon's expert who originally made products to fight against terrorists, but when he was captured as a war prisoner and forced to make weapons for the terrorists, the expert had to figure out how to escape. His escaping escapade led him to perfect the Iron Man suit (full of humorous scenes) and find out that back in America, there were some sneaky issues going on with his business and personal life around him. I enjoyed the sarcastic comments and dry wit of the Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man character, and of course, Terrence Howard's character was as smooth and charismatic as Howard is in every movie. The very beginning was interesting, then the next 20 minutes were slow, and the movie picked up after that and took off. I'm surprised to say I'd go see it again because I enjoyed the action, plus I loved the costume!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Mummy Returns (Widescreen Collector's Edition)"></head><body><p>The Mummy Returns (Widescreen Collector's Edition) is an entertaining blockbuster that is thin on plot and charachter development but heavy on special effects, one liners and many many action scenes. Do not expect great acting or a plot that remotely makes sense since if you do then you will be very disapointed since it has neither. I expected an actionpacked popcorn movie and this is what I got. 4/5.</p></body></html>

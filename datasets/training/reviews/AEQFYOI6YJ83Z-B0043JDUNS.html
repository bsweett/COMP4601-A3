<meta name="summary" content="A letdown, though still an entertaining superhero film."></head><body><p>Let's get this straight: If it hadn't been for THE DARK KNIGHT coming out a couple months later, IRON MAN would have been THE superhero movie of 2008.  It's still one of the best entries in the genre, with a complex plot, superior special effects, and the quick wit and sharp poignancy of Robert Downey Jr.<br /><br />The sequel, while featuring all three, is a letdown; while I knew to lower my expectations, they still weren't met.  The problems here are two-fold: miscasting, and a script that doesn't dare to be dark enough.  For the miscasting: obviously, Downey is still in fine form, though he doesn't get to ad-lib as much here.  Mickey Rourke doesn't have a whole lot to do; he and Downey share one (and only one) non-combat scene together, which is indeed a highlight of the film, even with minimal dialogue--proof that, when you put two great actors together alone in a room, you'll get great things.  Don Cheadle simply does not have Terrence Howard's charisma; he's a fine actor, but the role of Rhodey calls for more than mere talent.  Scarlett Johansson is utterly wasted; she's an amazing actress, but she's here for eye candy and nothing but.  Gwyneth Paltrow is as charming here as she was in the first film; and Sam Rockwell, in an utterly two-dimensional villainous role, does the best with what he's got.  Sam Jackson does his Sam Jackson thing as Nick Fury; take it or leave it, unfortunately his character isn't that essential to the film.<br /><br />Now for the script, from otherwise-talented scribe (and actor) Justin Theroux.  It's not deep; it's not dark.  And yet it tries to be both.  Is Rourke's Ivan Vanko justified in his anger towards Tony Stark?  Was Stark's father maybe not the paragon of virtue that Tony always thought?  How is Stark coping with the fact that he's dying (not a spoiler, by the way; you find out early enough)?  These are deep, penetrating issues, which promised to elevate IRON MAN 2 to an almost DARK KNIGHT level.  Instead, when a problem arises, we have an answer within a few minutes, miraculously provided by a minor character.  The movie doesn't deal with issues--it avoids them like the plague.  The first IRON MAN had a dark underbelly; it was never overly prominent, but it was there, lending the film an edge usually missing from the genre.  IRON MAN 2 is more family-friendly; it's meant to be a pleasing popcorn flick and nothing more.  It should have been more, which is why the film comes off as so disappointing.  For a film with such talent behind it--director, writer, cast--IRON MAN 2 fizzles halfway through, never reaching its potential, never being what we all wanted it to be.  It's less than the sum of its parts; it's still entertaining (hence the 3 Stars), and it's worth a repeated viewing or two, but in a post-IRON MAN/DARK KNIGHT world, we need more from our superhero movies than guys in costumes finding other guys in costumes.  We need depth, and you won't find much here.  The most poignant thing here is Vanko's love for his bird; for avian enthusiasts, maybe that's enough.</p></body></html>

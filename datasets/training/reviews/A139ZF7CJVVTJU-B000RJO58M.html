<meta name="summary" content="Too Hot For T.V."></head><body><p>Sergeant Nicholas Angel is good.  Too good.  An expert in virtually every aspect of police work, Mr. Angel is an example of the kind of supercop that Bruckheimer & Friends make fireball-fueled and car-chase-crazy movies about every day of the week.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DKDUR">Bad Boys II</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GUJZ4G">Point Break</a>, for example.<br /><br />These kinds of flicks provide the grist for Edgar Wright's "Hot Fuzz," a movie that takes almost every buddy cop cliche in the book and adds the same dose of wry humor and half-glimpsed sight gags that made <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006A9FKA">Shaun of the Dead</a> an equally delicious satire of horror films.<br /><br />"Fuzz" has some of the same faces as "Shaun of the Dead."  Simon Pegg returns as Angel, a man whose jealous London peers (including acting heavyweights Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman, and Steve Coogan) send him packing to the quaint cottage community of Sandford, a village so tweedy and polite that a man's missing swan is big news.  You half expect Sgt. Angel to turn the corner and see locals crafting homemade ranch dressing.<br /><br />Of course, things aren't exactly as they seem, and that goes double for the town's stellar lack of crime.  Angel, who is incapable of "turning off" his brain, joins his partner, the stumbly, bumbly, chummily Danny Butterman (Nick Frost playing, yet again, a man whose brain hardly ever seems to be on) as they work to unravel the mystery behind the town's cobbled, rustic veneer.<br /><br />It takes awhile, but that's only because "Hot Fuzz" doesn't want to leave any cliche unused.  Things get a little ludicrous, but, in spite of its frenetic music video editing and vicious murder scenes, this movie is all about ludicrousness.  The twists and turns are part and parcel for this kind of happy homage, which even gives a nod to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006HBUA">Scooby-Doo</a>.  Listen carefully and you'll hear a line that's too close to "I would've gotten away with it, too, if it hadn't been for you meddling kids" to be an accident.<br /><br />Watch carefully, too.  Wright and Penn have stacked jokes upon jokes, which is a good thing, since the movie appears to have about five different endings, each one more outrageous than the first.  Although things drag a bit near the end, it's the subtle background winks (a set of twins you don't know are twins until the end), the script's subtle finesse (listen and watch for someone named Aaron), and the super-duper subtle cameos (Cate Blanchett who you probably won't recognize, and an uncredited Peter Jackson as a blink-and-you'll-miss-him Santa Claus killer) that really make this flick work, in spite of its sometimes-ridiculous excesses.<br /><br />Anyway, the kinds of films "Hot Fuzz" is riffing off of aren't known for much more than their ridiculous excesses.  And although subtlety is an odd thing to look for in a film that is all about men with guns jumping sideways through the air, you don't need to worry.  There's still plenty of in-your-face action to light up the screen, including a very graphic head crushing, a critical car chase (there's that swan again!), and even a few great, big, chubby fireballs.<br /><br />Bruckheimer would be proud.</p></body></html>

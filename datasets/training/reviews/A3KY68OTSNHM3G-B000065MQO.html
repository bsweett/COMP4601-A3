<meta name="summary" content="An Extremely Graphic Movie About the Vietnam War"></head><body><p>Director Stanley Kubrick has created a masterpiece about the war in Vietnam.  Told through the eyes of Private Joker (Matthew Modine), this movie follows a group of recruits in basic training on Paris Island and then into combat in Vietnam.<br /><br />This movie is told in two sections.  Section one describes basic training.  Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) is the squad's drill instructor.  Ermey was the perfect choice for this role, having been an actual Marine sergeant in real life.  Hartman is a foul-mouthed pitbull of a drill instructor whose job it is to turn a bunch of young teenagers into a group of well-disciplined killers.  Most of the squad adjusts to Hartman fairly well, but Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) has great difficulty.  He is overweight, out of shape, and rather slow mentally, so he quickly draws the wrath of Hartman, who soon singles him out from the other members of the squad.  Pyle is always screwing up, and Hartman makes the rest of the group pay whenever he makes a mistake.  Soon, the squad gives Pyle an "attitude adjustment" in hopes of shaping him up.<br /><br />After six weeks of hard training, the squad is ready for graduation.  Pyle survives basic training, but its clear that he's pretty much lost his mind, as evidenced by the ending of the first section of the movie.<br /><br />Part two of the film deals with the actual fighting in Vietnam.  Joker, after completing basic training, has become a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, and its his job, along with his partner Rafterman (Kevyn Howard) to write news articles.  His job takes him to many different areas of Vietnam, but he finally latches onto a platoon with has Cowboy (Arliss Howard), his friend from basic training.  Also among the group are Eightball (Dorian Harewood) and Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin).<br /><br />Soon, the group finds themselves up against a concealed sniper who is picking off the squad one by one.  Determined to break through, the group charges ahead, but will they survive?<br /><br />This is a first-rate war movie.  Stanley Kubrick's directing is excellent, and his coice of R. Lee Ermey as Sgt. Hartman was perfect.  I especially liked the way that the movie was divided into two sections.  This made the movie that much more exciting to watch.  Matthew Modine and the rest of the cast give fine performances, too.  The battle scenes are very realistic, and even the scenes with the Vietnamese prostitutes are authentic.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The action is savage, the story is unsparing, and it shows both the rigors of basic training as well as the horrors of combat.  Watch this fine movie and experience the reality of war, from basic training to actual combat.</p></body></html>

There is something horrific about his screen presence that makes me want to take him "not seriously" Within this blockbuster,there lies a love story.It had to be because the director was too busy trying to be a Word Wide Hit.I'll excuse that and move on.<br /><br />Sam Hall played by Mr.Whoever was quite nonsensical.Reason,he's 17 and is supposed to be some sort of genius.To me he was sleep inducing. I actually slept after 50 mins of this film and watched it the next morning the second part.The reason for that was that I didn't quite feel what the film maker wanted the viewer to feel.<br /><br />The best two scenes in the film - the ones when the wolf jumped for SAM HALL (Mr.Whoever) I only wish he caught him and bit him off. I wouldnt have had to visit the worst father-son relationship story in a film ever.<br />Second fav.scene in the film I liked was the one where the Statue of Liberty was over taken by an ocean.Come on! That was just plain awesome.<br /><br />I live in New Delhi and I only wonder if my country looked like that.No seriously,I enjoyed the 130 second attention they paid to it.I think half way down the movie the director changed the script.The President dies and no scene based on that is shown.I mean, they show some idiot on the tv being dragged away but not the President of USA.<br /><br />I'll stop sounding like a hypocrite now.<br />Watch this movie for the same reason I did.I wondered how horrid it could be.<br /><br />2.75 Stars made it 3 Stars<br /><br />The best Sci-fiction ever is "The Core"<br /><br />PERIOD</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Watchable dark comedy with several fun performances"></head><body><p>"Once Upon a Time in Mexico" works as both a fable and a dark comedy. Anyone hoping for a dose of reality or a great drama will be disappointed. Director Robert Rodriguez admittedly was having a great time playing with his digital cameras and other gadgets while making the movie. The cast of excellent actors was also having fun, and none of them took the project seriously. Although the film is rather violent in a cartoonish sort of way, it's often very entertaining. It is what it is - nothing less, nothing more. <p>The movie is the third of Rodriguez's movies about the exploits of El Mariachi [Antonio Banderas], a wandering Mexican musician whose true avocation is fighting injustice and corruption. In this episode he uncovers a plot to kill a Central American president in order to install a military government that is friendly to a powerful drug cartel. One of the plan's leaders is the general who killed El Mariachi's wife [Selma Hayek] and daughter in the second movie, "Desperado". Another powerful adversary is Sands [Johnny Deep], a psychotic CIA agent who tries to use El Mariachi for his own devious purposes.  <p>Not a great movie, "Once Upon a Time in Mexico" is a fun movie.</p></body></html>

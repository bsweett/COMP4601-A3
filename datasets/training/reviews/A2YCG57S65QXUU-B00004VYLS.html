<meta name="summary" content="A Totally Different Caped Crusader"></head><body><p>The 1989 Tim Burton-directed version of the classic DC Comics superhero is as exciting and thrilling as well as dark, brooding and disturbing. Jack Nicholson has done a great job as the Joker(whose real name is not Jack Napier), and Michael Keaton is at his best as The Batman. The music score by Danny Elfman and the songs by Prince were the best components of the movie. The DVD also features a background story of how the film came to be. This will go down as one of the greatest DC Comics movies ever made.</p></body></html>

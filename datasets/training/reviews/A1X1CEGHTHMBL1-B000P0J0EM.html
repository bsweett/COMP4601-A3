<meta name="summary" content="One of the best Stephen King films!"></head><body><p>Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is the head guard on death row.  It is called the Green Mile by those at the prison because of the green floor that convicted men must walk to the electric chair.  John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) is convicted in court for the murder of two little girls.  He is a giant of a man and everybody believes that he must have done it but Paul begins to wonder if it is true.<br /><br />John is quiet and respectful of other people unlike a fellow prisoner.  He also has special powers that manifest themselves in front of the eyes of the death row guards.  They begin to doubt that John Coffey is a murderer, but.....<br /><br />This is a superb story that has been brought to the media of film in a perfect way.  The casting for the actors in this movie was one of the best I have ever seen.  The acting is astounding and the entire cast is perfect for their roles.  It is a story about the supernatural powers of one man and the evil that exists in the world.  John Coffey knows who killed the girls and in his own way he finds some retribution for the crime.<br /><br />This is an outstanding movie and if you like Stephen King you will absolutely love this movie!</p></body></html>

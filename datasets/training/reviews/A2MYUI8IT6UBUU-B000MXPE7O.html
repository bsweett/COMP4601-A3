<meta name="summary" content="The Good Shepherd Movie Review"></head><body><p>Ingeniously written, with superlative acting and a masterful score, this sinister drama delves into the mysterious and ruinous influences the CIA has on the lives of their dedicated operatives. A slightly disconcerting timeline doesn't deter from enjoying the crafty elements of betrayal, suspicion and sacrifice that permeate this Cold War espionage epic.<br /><br />Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is a well-rounded Yale graduate who is quickly recruited into the newly formed Central Intelligence Agency due to his desired qualities of discretion and commitment. Suspicion and paranoia gradually overrun his once steadfast belief in American values, as he rapidly becomes a chief operative and an integral part of the system. Engulfed in distrust and intent on combating his KGB rival, Wilson consequently sacrifices his ideals and his family in the pursuit of his career.<br /><br />The Good Shepherd achieves what films of this length usually attempt and rarely succeed at, and that is to delve into the inner-workings of its characters and explore character development to its most complex and absolute fullest. Meaningful events and poignant dialogue work beautifully to immerse the viewer into the traumatic lives of those involved in the secretive CIA and its shaky roots. Most prominently is the character study of the fictitious Edward Wilson, whose dynamic rise and fall parallels films such as The Godfather. Although they both fail in preventing what seems to be inevitable destiny, Wilson manages to wash away guilt, feeling and perhaps even acknowledgement of his situation and the sacrifices made to preserve the job that keeps him in an ominous stranglehold. Inhumanly he acts according to its will, half conscious of the consequences to his family and himself, and yet he relishes in the accomplishments that lead to absolute solitude. So many of his ill deeds are attempts at righting other wrongs, and he is perpetually fixed in compromises, sacrifices and decisions that aid the agency. His choices are those of ill-fate and necessity; he is capable of love, but unable to display it fruitfully, and like his father, negatively impacts the lives of his wife and son. A truly tragic character, the viewer is made aware of his hopeless cycle throughout the film, but only at the conclusion do we see the shell of the man chewed up and spit out and left in reflection; he fails to accept the realizations of how his choices affect those closest to him, even though such repercussions are unintentional. The intense themes of paranoia, suspicion, and betrayal are wonderfully conjured up through masterfully dramatic performances by rising star Matt Damon, and equally stunning supporting actors Angelina Jolie, William Hurt, and Robert De Niro. John Turturro plays operative Ray Brocco, another outstanding supporting performance, who menacingly and efficiently carries out his duty; he retains a sense of humor at his inception into the agency, but gradually develops into an efficiently torturous henchman. Robert De Niro, who also directs, makes a short appearance, as does Joe Pesci, who has been curiously out of the spotlight for a very long time, garnering a high billing even though his character appears for only one scene...<br /><br />Read the full review at www.moviepulse.net</p></body></html>

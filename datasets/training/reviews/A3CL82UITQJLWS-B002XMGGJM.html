I get wanting to reap revenge on the thugs that killed his family, but the level he took things to was way over the top and that made me not feel for the father at all and also borders on unbelievable. Killing or endangering the lives of innocents is unacceptable to me. Sure kill the two responsible for the crime b/c our legal system is too weak, but it should end there. I dont like the movie b/c it's a Richie Rich story of a brainiac father who apparently has access to military grade weaponry. Didn't like the ending either</p></body></html>

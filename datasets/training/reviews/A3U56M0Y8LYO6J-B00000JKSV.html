There are moments of brilliance scattered throughout the film but these moments only appear in spurts and are inter-cut with moments of sheer emotional detachment.<br /><br />Private Joker (Matthew Modine) and a group of raw recruits go through an agonizing combat training program headed by the tyrannical Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey).  The soldiers are molded into warriors but tragedy strikes when Private Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio) snaps under the physical and psychological trauma he has been put through.  Later when Joker heads to Vietnam, he experiences the horrors of war first-hand while carrying out his duties as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes.<br /><br />"Full Metal Jacket" scores points for devoting a substantial amount of time to the basic training program that the soldiers go through.  Oftentimes this aspect of war films is just covered in passing so that more time can be spent on the more riveting battle sequences.  Yet as interesting as the first half of the film is, "Full Metal Jacket" continuously feels distant.  Even when the setting shifts to Vietnam in the second half, the level of the film's emotional intensity still is stuck in neutral.  Kubrick, like Alfred Hitchcock before him, is a master film-making technician who sometimes had trouble infusing his works with passion and zeal.  The end result in this case is a superbly crafted film that just feels flat from start to finish.</p></body></html>

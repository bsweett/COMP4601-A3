<meta name="summary" content="This gave me a new understanding!"></head><body><p>One of the lines in the movie was "Most people that are watching what is going on over here mearling say, "that is to bad" and then go on eating their dinner."<br /><br />Those were words that haunted me throughout the rest of the film.  Now LUCKY we are to be Americans.  To be able to say and do anything and not be killed for it.  Even those jerks that high behind the first ammendment.  We as Americans have no idea how wonderful life is for us because we have never had to deal with such horrors as you will view in this film.<br /><br />Of course we had 911 in which most people have forgotten about or don't care about anymore because if we are not directly affected by it we seem to loose interest very fast because we live are lives very fast and don't take time to smell the roses.<br /><br />Everyone including children should view this masterpiece of a film.  This film tells it like it is and believe me you will appreciate your freedom all the more.  We can all thank GOD (Jehovah) for living in this wonderful country inspite of it's political views.  We are still much more lucky than the rest of the world.</p></body></html>

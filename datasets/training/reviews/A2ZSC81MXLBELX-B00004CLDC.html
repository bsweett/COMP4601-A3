<meta name="summary" content="Good Stuff....."></head><body><p>This review refers to the WB DVD edition of "Goodfellas".....<br /><br />Based on the book "Wiseguy"(a true story) by Nicholas Pileggi, "Goodfellas" follows the lives of New York mobsters for over 2 decades of crime, loyalties, and settled scores. Directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, Robert Deniro and Lorraine Bracco, it is an electrifying and innovative piece of filmaking.<br /><br />Scorsese gives us a remarkable and often graphic look at the lives of theses "Goodfellas" and their families. From the time they were young men working on the streets for the mob bosses in the late fifties, through more than 20 years of heists, murder, corruption, prison time and drug deals, it is a story that is truly captivating.<br /><br />Everything about this film is amazing.The film was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. The performances by the actors are as powerful as any I have ever seen. Joe Pesci recieved an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and well deserved for his portrayal of the explosive Tommy DeVito. A terrific Screenplay and wonderful Film Editing also got nods from Oscar, and the Soundtrack gives the feel of the time periods throughout.  It takes in everything from Tony Bennett to Sid Vicious and also the wonderful "Layla" by Derek and the Dominoes. Also adding their fabulous talents are Paul Sorvino, Debi Mazar, Illeana Douglas and Samuel L. Jackson.<br /><br />I thought the DVD was good transfer. The picture, presented in Widescreen was clear and sharp and the colors were very good. The sound in 5.1 Dolby Surround was not the best I ever heard, but it seemed to filter through nicely and the music and dialouge sounded good. There was the minor annoyance with having to turn the disc over and I also had a pausing problem with the first 2 minutes of Side B(This may just be my copy, as I have not seen any other complaints on that). Neither of these things effected my viewing pleasure enough to take a whole star off this remarkable film.No Special Features to speak of. There are some production notes, theatrical trailers and it may be viewed in French. There are subtitles in English, French and Spanish for those who may need them.<br /><br />This is a film that may not be for everybody. There is quite a bit of graphic violence and language, but at only 13 years old it is surely already  a classic.<br /><br />So Warner Bros....how about a special edition, one that we don't have to turn over???(and some commentary from Mr. Scorsese would be nice on this one too!).....Thanks and enjoy.....Laurie<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Joe Pesci:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6303219357">Jimmy Hollywood</a></p></body></html>

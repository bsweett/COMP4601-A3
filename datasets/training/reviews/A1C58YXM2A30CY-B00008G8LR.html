<meta name="summary" content="Hunter vs. Prey in this Exciting Sci-Fi Action Film!"></head><body><p>I got the bare-bones DVD version of the first Predator film, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dutch, the head of a crack military unit whose guys are hired for extraction or rescue mission jobs. Dutch has a sense of honor that Arnold plays well in all his action films.  His men will follow him anywhere.  He is resourceful and demands a high military standard.  His unit is called in on a "rescue" mission which he's not too happy about.  And his pal whom he thought he could trust, will go in charge of his unit!  Hell!<br /><br />The battle scenes when they ambush a bunch of South American militants is right out of a Rambo movie, except smartly played.  Schwarzenegger shows off his weightlifting roots in one scene as he blows up, chops up, and stabs his way through the compound.  I love these cheesy lines:  "Stick around!" as he stabs a guy through to the wall!  Vicious!<br /><br />As vicious as these guys are, they find they themselves are the hunted.  Hunted by a being from space who has a code of honor as strong and as vicious as Dutch's.  As his pals get skinned alive and their skulls become part of the Predator's collection, the rest of the film is pitting wits against wits -- blood and sweat against advanced alien tech.  Who will win?<br /><br />The Predator is a cool creature -- "ugly as hell" and yet recognizes when his prey is worthy of a true knock-down, drag-out fight!  The other army punks and such are cardboard in their acting and characterization, frankly.  It's really Arnold's film.<br /><br />Now that I've seen this film I really understand a lot of the innuendo in the last film, Predators, that was released this summer.  Exciting action/adventure film, some gore and very little sympathy.  A guy's film!<br /><br />Cast & Crew:<br /><br />Directed by<br />John McTiernan<br /><br />Writing credits<br />Jim Thomas<br />John Thomas<br /><br />Cast<br /><br />Arnold Schwarzenegger ...

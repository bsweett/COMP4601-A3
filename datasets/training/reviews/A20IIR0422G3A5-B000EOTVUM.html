<meta name="summary" content="Very Good Realistic Horror. Not as good as 'Chainsaw'"></head><body><p>`Wolf Creek' by Australian director, Greg McLean is a marvelous amalgam of several different horror movie conventions, with a result that is better than many of its models, but not quite as good as the best.<br /><br />For starters, the movie distinguishes itself by being totally free of any supernatural devices. The very best example of this genre is, of course, `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (the original, of course). The very best example of this theme in a mainstream film is `Deliverance', which is easily more scary than many genre horror movies.<br /><br />The sense of reality is enhanced by the statements that the plot is based on real events. Not being privy to any Australian newspapers, I have to believe the producers on this, and it is not too hard to believe, as I can imagine a dandy horror movie made from a homegrown American serial killer. (Come to think of it, it's already been done with `Silence of the Lambs').<br /><br />Unfortunately, this movie falls far short of the grand filmmaking of `Silence of the Lambs' and it even falls short by a bit from its primary mentor, Tobe Hooper, director of the original `Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. This is not to say it is not a good, chilling movie, as it makes good use of conventions which others have not used very well.<br /><br />Like `Cabin Fever', it makes good use of teenagers on a trip. Oddly, like `Cabin Fever', it also has an unbalanced group with an odd number of people instead of an evenly paired up boy girl, boy girl... Even more oddly, there is nothing made of any `triangles' created by this arrangement, but then, the primary order of business is horror, not romance. But, the director plays the relation between the principle characters exceptionally well until things start to get hinky with the car and the appearance of the perp. The writer also makes excellent use of the queasy feeling one gets about `out of towners' encountering the local crowd of louts, as played to the hilt in the classic cult film by Sam Peckinpah, `Straw Dogs'.<br /><br />While no supernatural agent is involved, the movie makes seems to make excellent use of a natural phenomenon in that the magnetic effects around a large Meteor crater, which also happens to be a major tourist attraction, disables automobiles which sit in the influence of the field for very long. The parties facing this disabled vehicle are then victim to the perp. The perp is so unusual as horror movies go that no less a figure than Quentin Tarantino is quoted on the cover as praising the invention of this character. This character is unusual, but I think he is still not as good as our old favorite, leatherface.<br /><br />The director seems to buy into the belief that things seem more horrible in the dark. This may be true when we are dealing with unseen, supernatural effects. But, if we are to learn anything from `Deliverance', it's that up close and personal terror is worse in the bright sunlight and in the open, unless we happen to be specifically playing on claustrophobia.<br /><br />For those who like their horror unvarnished with spooks and seemingly immortal characters like Halloween's Jason, this is a very rewarding shriekfest, even if the gore is not quite so well executed as by master Hooper.</p></body></html>

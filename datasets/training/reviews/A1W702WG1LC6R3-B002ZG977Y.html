<meta name="summary" content=""Good Fantasy Remake!""></head><body><p>Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes<br />star in this 2010 fantasy remake of the 1981 film.<br />A young man goes on a quest to defeat an evil<br />God and battles mythic monsters. This is good,<br />but I don't agree with Sam's shaved head look<br />because they didn't have barbers back then.<br />This dvd has nice picture and sound, but only<br />deleted scenes and I wish it had the alternate<br />ending that's on the blu-ray. I recommend this.</p></body></html>

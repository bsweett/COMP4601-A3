That same year, the highly controversial, yet popular director Oliver Stone ("Alexander") brought his view to the events of that day by chronicling some of the rescue efforts taking place at Ground Zero in the equally powerful and moving "World Trade Center" starring Nicolas Cage ("Ghost Rider"), Maria Bello ("A History of Violence"), and Michael Pena ("Shooter").<br /><br />"World Trade Center" begins on the morning of September 11th, 2001 and continues on into that evening, chronicling the horrifying hours spent buried beneath the rubble of Towers 1 and 2 by survivors numbers 18 and 19, John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena). As the minutes stretch into hours, John and Will struggle to keep each other awake and to not lose hope that they will soon be rescued, while back at home their loving wives (Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhall) cling to their family members and try to remain optimistic and strong, holding on to the hope that they will once again be reunited with their husbands.<br /><br />When it was announced that the events of September 11th were going to be captured on film by both "United 93" and "World Trade Center", some felt that it was too soon, or that the films would in some way exploit that day, disrespecting all who lost their lives that day and the heroes who tried to save them. For "United 93" that was pretty much where the criticism ended, but for "World Trade Center" another concern was that its director, Oliver Stone, would use his film as just another vehicle for his conspiracy theories as he had done before in the films "JFK" and "Born on the Fourth of July". However, when both films were released to theaters all of the concerns regarding the content were quickly silenced. Both films showcased the utmost respect for those who were victims of that day whether they be those on the planes, or trapped in the rubble beneath the buildings, or the families left behind, all were honored and never once exploited.<br /><br />For those of us that were pleased by the outcome of Oliver's effort, there were some people that were disappointed in him for not presenting a more controversial viewpoint in "World Trade Center", feeling that by choosing to make a more balanced and accurate account of that day, he had somehow sold out. I for one was proud of Oliver Stone for making, what is for him a brave decision, to set aside his penchant for controversy, and make the best movie he could make to accurately depict what these people went through and to honor their sacrifice. Bravo, Mr. Stone. You've now come one step closer to realizing that there's not always a covered-up conspiracy behind every major event in human history, and that you don't have to use controversy to make a great film.<br /><br />The performances in "World Trade Center" were excellent all across the board. The most impressive performances were those of Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena, who for about 90% of the movie were buried beneath dirt, and realistic looking rubble with essentially only their faces in plain view. For an actor to not be able to make gestures of any kind while talking must be a very difficult test of their ability, I mean even everyday people rely heavily on their hands to get their points across in any given conversation (even when on the phone), so for an actor to be forced to only rely on their facial expressions to convey their feelings and actually succeed in doing so is a huge testament to their talent. The supporting cast led by Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhall were equally strong, and consisted of some of the most emotional aspects of the movie, as the wives focus inward to cope with the fear of losing their husbands, while on the outside remaining strong for their children and/or relatives. Rounding out the cast were two highly capable actors, Stephen Dorff ("Blade") and Michael Shannon ("Bug"), who portrayed two of the most pivotal people in regards to John and Will's rescue, the lead rescuer Scott Strauss and the marine who discovered their location, Dave Karnes. Though their roles were essentially cameo appearances, both men delivered very strong, believable performances; and for Stephen Dorff, it was possibly one of the best roles I had seen him in to date.<br /><br />Earlier, I stated that all concerns regarding the two films were silenced upon their release (especially those regarding "World Trade Center"), this is true for most of the concerns, all except for one. The concern of some that it was just too soon was a concern that still remained even after the release, and for some it will never cease to be too soon. But for everyone else, "World Trade Center" is a film that should be watched, as it is an incredibly moving piece of cinema that celebrates everything that is great about the American spirit; our courage, compassion, self-sacrifice, inability to give up, and above all, our hope.<br /><br />"World Trade Center" is rated PG-13 for language and disturbing images.</p></body></html>

Little did I know how much I would enjoy this movie. This was a non stop action/thinking man' picture.<br />Take the best elements of an action film,mix it up with the best moments of National Treasure or the 1990's Mummy series with Brendan Fraser along with some horror elements & POOF! you get a great movie.<br />Tom Hanks was brilliant in this, in fact the entire cast was tremendous. Hanks character as Robert Langdon as a character that we as viewers can root for. For me it was a rare thing in today's movie to actually like the character and root for him to stop the evil doings.<br />The story has Langdon tracking down an evil society known as the Illuminati who are murdering 4 Cardinals for the sake of religion, sin and God. It was a thrill ride as Langdon goes from one Church to another in pursuit, going through catacombs, crypts, following signs to track the group down.<br />It was very , VERY suspenseful, non stop & just a lot of fun to watch. The gore pieces were really well done. One scene with rats reminded me of a movie called Virgin of Nuremberg. It wasnt gory just have gore, it was more of style like Dario Argento used to do. It was also refreshing to have a man and woman work together and not have a romantic interest. It was also refreshing to see a more mature picture or a film where characters have that 'been there,done that' attitude with corny dialog. It wasn't tongue in cheek (thank God)<br />Now I will say I haven't read the book as I am more of a movie watcher so I can not compare the movie to the book. For me as a movie this was superior entertainment - . From a movie standpoint, I thoroughly enjoyed this - kudos to Ron Howard</p></body></html>

It's not a mere casualty in the Thirties until the first half of the Forties, the role of the hero was substituted by the antihero: Gary Cooper and Clark Gable were the genuine ambassadors in this aspect.  In the second half of the forties, John Wayne becomes the legendary hero in the far West. In the Fifties the anti hero returns with several faces; the new generations emerged after the bloody WW2 found in James Dean, Montgomery Clift, Lee Marvin and Marlon Brando the expression of rebelliousness and anti conformism; and while Humphrey Bogart, Richard Widmarck and William Holden in the first half and then Burt Lancaster, Paul Newman and Lee Marvin became hard to die schemes of non conformist individuals represented the dark side of the moon respect the ambiguities and desolation of the Cold War, for the adults who lived in own flesh the horror of the War; Cary Grant, James Stewart, Gregory Peck and Ernest Borgnine were the good guys. But there was a third way, still unexplored; the mythic hero that found in Kirk Douglas the perfect personage. In the sixties, Steve Mac Queen, Jon Voight assumed the role of the wanderer. The Seventies in the first half were two urban heroes in their respective forties emerged: Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson; the second half of the Seventies was represented by Sylvester Stallone (the humble hero) and directly from Australia Mel Gibson (Mad Max) embodied the role of the future hero. The Eighties returned with imported figure of a new vision of antihero of intergalactic origin: Schwarzenegger (Terminator, Command and Predator) Harrison Ford ( through the most emblematic films of that decade Blade runner) Al Pacino, Robert de Niro, Chuck Norris, Wilhelm Defoe (Platoon) and Kevin Costner (The untouchables and Silverado) in law's defense. But with the Nineties perhaps initiated the acidic mockery of this genre, you should remember three films that revitalize and sharp the antihero (Dance with wolves and The unforgiven and American Beauty), featured by Bruce Wills' bitter gaze (in Die hard I, II and III, Mercury rising and Armageddon), Keanu Reeves (Matrix) or John Travolta (Pulp fiction) and finally Mel Gibson would feature the role of the tragic hero in "Brave heart"  while the actual decade would seem have found a new revival in Russell Crowe (Gladiator) and Brad Pitt (Achilles in Troy).<br /><br />Smartly Robert Rodriguez knew about the orphanage around the essence of the hero in the Latin American universe, and then proceeded to represent in Antonio Banderas (The appropriate emblem of the new generations) supported by an exceptional cast featuring Johnny Depp as an irreverent and even surrealist agent from the CIA, a dark and sinister  personage (Wilhelm Defoe) in a extremely blooded film, that essentially availed the whole meaning of the violence in the most strict sense conferred by Sam Peckinpah (The wild bunch) in what concerns to present heroes without past and very doubtful future, absolutely not related with the values of the civilization. Remember the last wish of The Mariachi when responses to his wife "To be free" as his supreme aspiration and undeniable bliss.<br /><br />Visually stunning provided of a devilish, engaging, energetic and frenetic rhythm.<br /><br />The only default: Enrique Iglesias (who pitifully was the only (actor?) who looked absolutely unfocused and seemed to be in a video clip instead a real movie, what a mess!)</p></body></html>

A veritable &quot;who's who&quot; of well known stars grace a collection of short stories, in funny, romantic, sad, and heartwarming scenarios, and the end result, though a bit muddled is cleverly handled. A real testament to the success of this movie after it's release was how well it was received here in the States, for being a fairly formula laden Richard Curtis written &amp; directed production. Some of the stories do stretch the boundaries of credulity a little, but the flavor of the Christmas magic allows even the most cynical viewers to be forgiving. The performances are ALL great, as seemingly the entire range of human emotions are played out before you in each individual tale, culminating in a clever, and touching set of finales. Some of the language will make this unsuitable for younger viewers, but good family viewing overall. Often very touching but never sickly sweet, this is a great DVD buy, and will be surely pulled out every holiday season, along with the host of other well known seasonal regulars. Enjoy</p></body></html>

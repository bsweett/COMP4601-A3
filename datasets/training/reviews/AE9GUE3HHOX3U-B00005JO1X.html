They are basically the same movie, lost souls searching for themselves and a better world.  The only difference is Wizard Of Oz is a timeless magical tale and there are flying monkies instead of Narnia's talking wolves.  Narnia lumbers along with computer generated talking animals that look fake beyond belief.  They talk like psycho adults bumbling around like fools on a mission.  I'm sure it's great for children, this really is a children's film in the end.  The enchantment is missing from this film.  instead we get harsh winter scenes and a nasty war towards the end.  I never finished the rest of the film, it had me dozing off so I shut it down before the war, I assume.  If you want to see good fantasy films I would recommend The Wizard Of Oz, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy or even The Others.  Narnia just didn't hit me over the head.</p></body></html>

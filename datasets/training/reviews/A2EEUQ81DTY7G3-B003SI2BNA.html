<meta name="summary" content=""My husband thinks I'm crazy!""></head><body><p>The film Dark Water is something of an enigma. It boasts some great acting, strong direction by Walter Salles, and some realistic dialogue - and it's also suitably creepy and morbidly atmospheric, but the payoff, the final climax is also quite small, and the film is ultimately hampered by a setup that takes a little too long to play out.<br /><br />Dark Water undoubtedly has a stirring visual sense, and Salles eloquently sets the creepy mood; it also helps that he's enlisted the talents of some great actors, most notably the gorgeous Jennifer Connolly, who once again proves that she's is one of the accomplished and intriguing actresses of her generation.<br /><br />However, with all its efforts to be an effective and chilling psychological thriller, one can't help feeling that the, the recurring thematic elements in Dark Water are still all too familiar to anyone who has seen any installment of The Ring cycle, or not to mention the recent Amityville Horror. It's just that Dark Water does it a little slicker and is a lot more polished.<br /><br />Connelly plays newly divorced mom Dahlia Williams. Her separation from her husband Kyle (Dougray Scott) has been anything but pleasant and now she's in the midst of a custody battle for her young daughter Ceci (Ariel Grade). She and Ceci have just moved into a depressing ninth-floor apartment in a sprawling block of austere concrete monoliths on the bleak Roosevelt Island because it's only two blocks from one of the best schools in the New York/New Jersey metro area, and it's affordable.<br /><br />But Kyle, believing Dahlia to be an unfit mother - she occasionally suffers from paranoid headaches and is at times delusional - wants sole custody of his daughter. Meanwhile, there's a problem with Dahlia and Ceci's new home: a leak in the bedroom ceiling drips black water. The building's handyman (Pete Postlethwaite) is unwilling to fix it, and the smarmy complex manager (John C. Reilly) is also reluctant to take responsibity.<br /><br />Soon, Dahlia is wondering if the leak may be the result of activities in 10F, the apartment directly above hers. While Dahlia tries in vain to get her ceiling fixed, Ceci begins to converse with an imaginary friend who may not be that imaginary. It's not long before Dahlia becomes so haunted by the spooky goings on that she's imagining all sorts of weird things.<br /><br />She becomes so convinced that her husband is out to drive her crazy that she enlists the help of a smarmy divorce lawyer (a nice supporting turn by Tim Roth). But are these apparitions' just figments of her imagination, a result of the medications that she's taking, or is there something more sinister and supernatural at work?<br /><br />Rather than concentrate on creating suspense, Sales seems to be more concerned with exploring the intimate bond between mother and child, and it is in these quieter scenes that Connelly is really able to shine. The movie's themes of abandonment and the effects of living a lonely and isolated life in the big city are trenchant, incisive, and timely; and the director also allows things to unfold gradually, but this slow progression unfortunately results in a loss of energy.<br /><br />Dark Water takes place in an unending state of gloom. It's New York City and it's always raining, with the sun nothing but a vague memory, the murkiness and shadowiness symbolizing the darkened state of Dahlia's psyche. As Dahlia struggles with her sanity, the supernatural elements weave around her life. Perhaps this is where the film is least successful, as it doesn't have deep enough currents to succeed as a psychological thriller and, as a ghost story; consequently there are times when Dark Water has trouble lifting itself out of the watery muck.<br /><br />Despite Dark Water's apparent dramatic shortcomings, the movie more than makes up for this with it's masses of eerie and ghostly atmosphere. You can almost smell the suffocating dankness in Affonso Beato's redolent, shadow-laced cinematography and in production designer Therese DePrez's appropriately washed-out earth tones.

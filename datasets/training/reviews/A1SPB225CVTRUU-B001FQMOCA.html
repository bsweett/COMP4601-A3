<meta name="summary" content="Phoenix and Witherspoon Cashing in their Oscar-caliber performances!"></head><body><p>I must say that while I am not a Country Western music fan, I do love biopics if it's well made. The main appeal of Walk the Line for me is to see the performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon whom I have followed since Legally Blonde. I am not even familiar with any of Johnny Cash's music, and yet I was so dazzled by the singing of his songs done by Phoenix, especially that "Ring of Fire" song near the end. To my surprise, I was very taken by Phoenix' mesmerizing performance that actually moved me to tears during the time when his character was down and out and recovering from drug addiction. The love and marriage proposal scene was also very touching.<br /><br />This film chronicles the early struggle and triumphs of Cash's life and career as a rebellious country musician in the '50s and '60s. He had three children with his first wife Vivian, but they got divorced dued to his wild and irresponsible behaviors. June Carter(Witherspoon) was the love his life, and it took many years before he pursuaded her to marry him. In the late '50s Cash was at the top of his game, but his drug addiction eventually caused the downfall of his career. His father(Robert Patrick in heavy makeup to look older) alienated him because he blamed him for the death of second son. It had casted shadows over Cash's life ever since. June and Johnny were the best musician duo/lovers and they were destined to become lifelong partners, despite the lack of social acceptances since they had been married to other people previously.<br /><br />Both Withspoon and Phoenix did their own singing and were pretty convincing. It was very natural for Withspoon to deliver her lines in an authentic southern accent. Her June Carter rendition stole numerous scenes and it's certainly her most impressive performance to date. Too bad her role is more of a major supporting role, which limits her chances of getting an Oscar nomination in the best actress cateogory. As for Phoenix, he had obviously transcended the emotions from the death of his brother River into several of the scenes in this film which made it even more powerful and real. He may not become the front runner for the Oscar this year, but a nomination is sure thing.</p></body></html>

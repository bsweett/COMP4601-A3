<meta name="summary" content="Fact vs. Fiction"></head><body><p>Based on Ian McEwan's best-selling novel, Director Joe Wright produces an amazing and stunning film that respectively complements the book.  The film and storyline may appear to be the typical love story.  However, it is much more complicated and threefold.  First, the romance between Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) and Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) and the wild imaginations of Cecilia's wide-eyed and presumptuous younger sister, Briony (Saoirse Ronan), who would cause her own lifetime of regret.  Second, Cecilia and Robbie finding their way back together despite a war torn landscape.  And third, Briony's attempt to reconcile and atone the wrong she had done between Cecilia and Robbie with the publication of her memoir.<br /><br />The cinematography is cleverly and beautifully shot.  If one closely looks at how the film proceeds like an Alfred Hitchcock mystery, the storyline is not cut and dry, and one will see how the fragments of events evolve and revise from the conflicting beginning to the climactic end.  Briony's character reveals how facts of her personal past can easily be changed for a desirable fictitious narrative; indeed, her character steals the show.  And although this may look like a love and war film as displayed in the grotesque and surreal Dunkirk scenes and scenes of Robbie's undying love for Cecilia, it is Briony's self-discovery and maturity she eventually achieves at the end of the film.<br /><br />As with many novels that have been made into films, the film is missing some of the graphic and detailed narrative that the novel provides.  If Wright had made a duplicate of McEwan's book, the film would have been longer.  Nonetheless, with the crafty film-making, ATONEMENT is a top-notch movie that is deserving of its accolades for an Academy Award nomination.</p></body></html>

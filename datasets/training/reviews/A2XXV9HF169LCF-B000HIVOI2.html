<meta name="summary" content="Well, it comes before the series..."></head><body><p>I own this because it comes before the series. The series is better. <p>Basically it's about a gate that was left on earth by aliens who built the pyramids. The gate takes you to the middle of the Sahara desert... oh, wait, it takes you to a far-off world where there are Bedouin - Ooops, no, not Bedouin, other humans seperated from earth. Sorry, I got confused. <p>Anyways, it's neat and you should watch it, then watch the series.</p></body></html>

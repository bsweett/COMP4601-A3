I dismissed this film at first as another teen movie full of crap and not much else.  Boy, I was suprised!  Dude, this is funny!  knee-slappin', lockjawed rippin' laff out loud funny.  It's also nice to see these characters aren't pure white goodie goodie boys, they are Asian and Indian.  They are real characters and not a one note underdeveloped joke.  Well written and full of great cameos.  The best is from Doogie Howser himself.  Great casting and fast paced direction make this film a keeper.</p></body></html>

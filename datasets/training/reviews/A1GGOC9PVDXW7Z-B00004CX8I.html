<meta name="summary" content="McMurphy: "I must be crazy to be in a loony bin like this.""></head><body><p>This 1989 CANNON Group videotape is a full screen SP speed dub that has clean HiFi audio.<br /><br />ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST premiered on Broadway 11/13/63, had a short 82 performance run and closed on 1/25/64. Opening night cast included Kirk Douglas as R.P. McMurphy, Ed Ames as Chief Bromden, William Daniels as Dale Harding, Gerald S. O'Loughlin as Cheswick and Arlene Golonka as McMurphy's ladyfriend, Candy Star and Gene Wilder as Billy Bibbit.<br /><br />This film adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel won Oscars for Best Picture, director Milos Forman, star Jack Nicholson, co-star Louise Fletcher and Best Screenplay. It was the first movie since Frank Capra's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800114566">IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT</a> (1934) to sweep these major categories. "Cuckoo's Nest" grossed over $112 million (in 1975 dollars).<br /><br />SYNOPSIS--<br />Randle McMurphy is sent from state prison to a psych hospital for evaluation. When he bets with other patients that he can "put a bee in Nurse Ratched's bonnet," McMurphy isn't aware that his misbehavior may doom him to be held indefinitely and far beyond the term of his prison sentence. Although there are several comical moments in this story, there's far more dramatic and ultimately tragic ones, including scenes of such "therapies" as restraints, shock treatment and lobotomy.<br /><br />The cast, many of whom are relative newcomers, is a brilliant one. Kudos to Brad Dourif in his second film, as the tragic Billy Bibbit and to 6' 4" Creek Indian, Will Sampson as the "deaf & dumb" Chief Bromden. This is the sort of movie that bears up well to repeated viewings and is one that belongs in every serious video collector's home library.<br /><br />Also available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NF97LC">DVD</a>.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.9) One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) - Jack Nicholson/Louise Fletcher/Will Sampson/Christopher Lloyd/Danny DeVito/Vincent Schiavelli/William Redfield/Brad Dourif/Scatman Crothers</p></body></html>

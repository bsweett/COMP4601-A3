<meta name="summary" content="NAKED HUMAN HYBRID"></head><body><p>Not as sexy as Species. In fact I really didn't find the hairless human hybrid, even when naked, sexy at all. A couple splices genes and creates a new species of globs they call Fred and Ginger. The globs are created to produce proteins etc. to enhance animal livestock. The inventive couple discovers they could splice human DNA and create a new species in order to cure human genetic diseases. The corporation forbids them from such an experiment so they go underground to do it. The woman, Elsa (Sarah Polly, slightly mentally unstable) uses her own DNA to create a creature which in the interest of time develops very rapidly. The infant looks like something out of Lynch's Eraserhead. Eventually they have to move the human hybrid to a farm where it is cared for by her and her boyfriend Clive (Adrian Brody).<br /><br />The movie is intellectually interesting, but at the same time has poor characters. I thought I was going to adore this movie from reading the box, but alas, I did not as the stupidity of the characters got in the way.<br /><br />The F-bomb is dropped a few times. Human hybrid nudity and sex including one rape.<br /><br />It is maybe worth a view, but keep the expectations low. Adrian Brody has done better work.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Stirring Movie About One of America's Greatest Generals"></head><body><p>Starring George C. Scott (Gen. George S. Patton) and Karl Malden (Gen. Omar Bradley), this impeccable war movie describes the impact that General George Patton had on the U.S. Army after 1943.  Following the disaster at Kasserine Pass, in which American armor and strategly was thoroughly outclassed by the Germans, the Americans realized that a new commander was needed to command their armored units.  Patton was chosen, and his impact was felt immediately by the Germans, and he didn't let up until he was relieved by General Eisenhower.<br /><br />From 1943 until the surrender of Germany in May, 1945, Patton and his vaunted 3rd Army group harassed the Germans from Sicily to France.  He is responsible for driving his group one hundred miles in two days to rescue the trapped 101st airborne troops who were surrounded at Bastogne, and he led his troops on a brilliant drive through France and into Germany itself.<br /><br />This film does an excellent job of portraying the flamboyant Patton.  His numerous run-ins with his rival British General Montgomery are well-portrayed, and his battles with the press and his American superiors are explained in great detail, as well.  Perhaps the defining scene of the movie is when Patton is visiting a field hospital and he encounters an American private who is suffering from battle fatigue.  Patton slaps the soldier across the face and has him removed from the hospital and sent directly back to the front.  Word of this action eventually got back to Eisenhower, and Patton was made to apologize to the soldier and his entire Army.  This event followed Patton for the rest of his career.<br /><br />George C. Scott and Karl Malden give excellent performances in their roles as Patton and Bradley.  Scott's portrayal won him an academy award for best actor, while Malden's portrayal of Bradley, the "soldier's soldier", is the perfect antithesis to Scott's fiery portrayal as Patton.  The evolution of the friendship and mutual respect that developed between Patton and Bradley is handled extremely well, also.<br /><br />This is one of the greatest war movies I've seen.  Scott's acting is impeccable, and the historical accuracy, right down to Patton's ivory-handled pistols and his intense hatred for not only the Germans, but the Russians as well, is told with a remarkable flair that will keep the viewer glued to their screen.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Watch and see how one man personally changed the course of the war against the Germans.</p></body></html>

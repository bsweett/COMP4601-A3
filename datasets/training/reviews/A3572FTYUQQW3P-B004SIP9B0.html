<meta name="summary" content="A  Queen in a gilded cage"></head><body><p>I really liked this movie and Helen Mirren -- as usual -- does a fantastic job of portraying the Queen and her royally dysfunctional family as complex anachronisms.  Ms Mirren absolutely deserves the kudo's she has received and could easily capture an oscar for her performance.  She is definitely aided by the makeup and costumes which also deserve mention as being outstanding.  Several things stand out in this movie which I felt served to capture the royal family, its isolation, its dislike of Diana (and why), and its weird family dynamics.  The line "Diana is even more annoying dead than she was alive" I thought captured their real dislike of her as a person.  Even more distrubing was the reaction the Queen had to the death of the stag versus her reaction to the death of Diana. Heart felt emotion for the stag, nothing for Diana.  The flap over the flag was a real indication of how this family is trapped by tradition and protocol, which is more important to them than people.  In fact this film, which may be close to the truth, shows that the royal family lives in a gilded cage constructed of tradition, protocol, slavish minions, and isolation from any real people.No one dares tell them the truth or to disturb the tranquility of their placid and unreal existence.  Clearly this is why Diana was so despised by them.  Diana was outgoing, hated the protocol, the stiffness and almost total lack of emotion, love, or family.  She was everything they hated but everything they needed.  Of course they really never understood that and even today they have little grasp of how outdated they are as an institution.  This is a totally dysfunctional family and you see Prince Charles as a grown man incapable of making his own decisions because he must get permission from the Queen.  Prince Phillip -- one minute he is husband and the next he is subject, but clearly he is the most isolated of all -- and likes it that way -- unless he doesn't get his way.  These are living anachronisms and Mirren manages to convey that even they are beginning to realize that.<br /><br />The Tony Blair character (Sheen) is well done and really shows the schizophrenic attitude the Brits have toward the Royal Family.  The PM of England is certainly one of the most powerful men in the world, yet we see him bowing and (gag) kneeling to kiss the hand of the sovereign.  It shows how he has the power but his power is fleeting while the royal family has the influence which remains as long as the monarchy exists.  Which the film clearly shows is on shaky ground due to the isolation of the royal family.<br /><br />I only gave this 4 stars because I thought the cinematography was distracting at times and there were too many gratuitous shots of Diana, but Mirren's performance is well worth the price of admission.</p></body></html>

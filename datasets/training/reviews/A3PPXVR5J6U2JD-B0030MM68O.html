He is a replacement for Staff Sergeant Thompson (Guy Pearce), who died from an IED in Baghdad. The other two member sof the team are James' guards who act as lookouts to prevent a follow-up ambush during bomb disposal, Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). This is the story of an elite specialist, not a grunt who took on military service because he was looking to prove himself.  The Hurt Locker asks: what kind of person becomes an expert at the most dangerous job in the world?<br /><br />Sanborn and Eldridge count the days before their time is up - when they return home to their families, or when a sniper's bullet finally kills them.  Eldridge is nervous, jumpy, and on a slippery slope.  Sanborn is the consummate professional who goes by the book, but in a war torn land where few rules apply, James' flagrant disregard for safety rattles him.  Both men are convinced that James will be the death of them.<br /><br />And they're right.  James is good at what he does because he defines his universe from within.  James decides to befriend a young boy he nicknames Beckham (Christopher Sayegh) because he reminds James of his son. When James discovers a child victim of terror, James decides - with no evidence whatsoever - that it's Beckham.  It doesn't matter if the child is actually alive or dead.  James' boundaries are constructed in his own mind, because the forces he work with are entirely unpredictable.  Calmly detached from his own reality, James decides the bombs won't go off because they haven't yet, that he will live because he's survived so far. In a fickle, cruel world, James' self-centeredness borders on sociopathy, but it's exactly the kind of mindset he needs to be so good at facing down death every day.<br /><br />The problem is that supreme selfishness is not a trait that the military values.  What makes James an excellent bomb disposal expert makes him a terrible soldier in the field, and he nearly gets his team members killed in a misguided mission of revenge.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker culminates in a standoff over a Iraqi civilian with a bomb strapped to his chest. The experience convinces Sanborn to return home and settle down, but it never penetrates the inward-looking sphere that is James' ego.<br /><br />What makes the Hurt Locker so good is how it tells a story inward-out instead of outward-in. This is James' story first and foremost; everyone else, from his teammates to civilians to his own family, are just characters in his orbit.  And yet all those characters feel real. The Hurt Locker may be James' story, but it tells the plight of soldiers everywhere through sand, tears, sweat, and blood.</p></body></html>

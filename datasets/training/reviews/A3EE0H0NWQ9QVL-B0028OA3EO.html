<meta name="summary" content="'Superman Returns' Spectacularly, but not Flawlessly"></head><body><p>It is inevitable that 'Superman Returns' will be compared to the series of 'Superman' movies starring Christopher Reeves that came out in the eighties, but it is best to judge this movie on its own terms.  'Superman Returns' is a fitting return for the caped crusader with advantages and disadvantages from its predecessors.  The technology and grandeur are stunning enough, and the situations he's placed into are dire enough to keep our interest for long stretches throughout.  The acting is a mixed bag, and the side melodrama, while not as compelling as 'Spiderman 2,' is interesting enough to garner its place in the movie.<br /><br />Superman returns after a voyage from the his home planet, Krypton, leaving a void that was filled by Lois Lane with a lover and a boy--and a world returning to injustice.  She is resentful, and he has much explaining to do, but his return is timely enough to coincide with a wrinkle in the justice system:  Lex Luther has found a loop-hole, upon which he may return to the civilized world and wreak havoc.  The causality of his criminal mayhem should raise eyebrows by motive and method:  He wishes to control the world by creating new land via small samples of crystals obtained from Superman's arctic lair.  He will lay waste with his new land creation and implement an environmental terrorism meant to wipe out billions of people and near continents, both submerged under water.  Next, he will be in charge of the new real estate.  The execution of the plot certainly creates substantial tension where the unintentional silliness fails to make us believe...<br /><br />It is Kevin Spacey's portrayal as Lex Luther, however, that bridges much of the credibility gap.  While Gene Hackman's portrayal was thoroughly entertaining as Luther, Spacey's is creepy and menacing.  And the directing has made all the difference.  While madcap director Richard Lester ('A Hard Day's Night', et al) made the 'Superman' series into a glorious cartoon, Bryan Singer turns 'Superman' into a foreboding spectacle.  This is not to say there aren't funny moments, but the general campiness of the Lester fare has been abandoned for a more taut adventure.  The other performances aren't as worthwhile, but they do provide a different venue.  Brandon Routh's Superman provides quiet strength, but little of Reeve's charisma.  He does the duo identities decently, but not spectacularly.  He is nerdy enough as Kent, but only exhudes the strong silent type to sustain his stature.  Similarly, Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane is attractive enough in looks and personality, but there are a few missing nuances as well. Comparisons to Margot Kidder aren't fair because she did well for Lester's carnival atmosphere.  Bosworth gives us an immediate emotional anchor for the film's plots, though. Also, sometimes the plot is fragmented, which can only be justified as a series of warm-ups for the main plot.<br /><br />In sum, 'Superman Returns' does to Superman what 'Batman Begins' does to Batman.  It removes the campiness, returns to basics, and starts to thrill us with ominous adventure.  Only in 'Superman Returns' it doesn't do it as well.</p></body></html>

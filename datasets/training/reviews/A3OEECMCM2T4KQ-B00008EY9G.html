It is your classic "Who dun it?" with all the hallmarks of the great crime stories over the last century. If this film had a narrator, the picture would begin with, "It was a dark and stormy night..." ~Identity~ is so rife with literary devices and tired old clich&eacute;s that it was difficult to settle in at first. However the film is well directed and the performances are not played over the top, thus one can sit back and enjoy the familiar ride. Like all great crime mysteries, the fun is gathering the clues and deducing the perpetrator - Was it the butler in the study? The maid in the kitchen?" Or was it Colonel Mustered in the drawing room? This film could almost be classified as a parody but its creators seemed to have taken it very seriously. Once we think we know what's really going on, and those involved are headed towards living `happily ever after', the story takes another unexpected twist. This is standard practice for the genre - one can only be sure that the film has really ended when the credits begin the roll. Before the film's release, seeing its trailers, my expectations, in hindsight, were a little too high. I don't know what I expected, but it wasn't this film. That said, taken for what it is, ~Identity~ is fun viewing and worth the price of admission.</p></body></html>

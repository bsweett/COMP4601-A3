<meta name="summary" content="Viewing it again it is at least a decent sequel 6.5/10"></head><body><p>Hannibal 10 years after Silence Of The Lambs this had a lot of expectation lot of people hate this movie I'll admit I didn't care for it when I saw it the 1st time but I saw it again I have to say it was a decent sequel not a good sequel but I find it decent espically when compared to Red Dragon which I don't care for or even Hannibal Rising which is s hi t  t y. Directed by Ridley Scott he directed Alien Thelma & Louise Blade Runner GI Jane Black Hawk Down among many other films. Starring Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling Ray Liotta as Paul Krendler Giancarlo Giannini as Pazzi & Gary Oldman as Mason Verger. Story is about 10 years or so after Slience Clarice Starling is a veteran FBI agent you open up she & a team are going after some drug dealers they see the head girl of the gang she is carring a baby she calls the sting off but the Washington DC polic e jump the gun so to speak they get fired upon we get a big shoot out Clarice tells the head girl to surrender she shoots Clarice but she is wearing body armor of course she shoots & kills that head girl which lands her in hot water cause she was carring a baby. Meanwhile you got this cop in Florance Pazzi who is suspicous of this guy who he finds out that he is Hannibal Lecter. This 1 guy Mason Verger figures into the plot cause he has a bit of history with Hannibal cause he crippled him & had him mess his face up pretty good. So he'll use anybody to get back at Lecter. Clarice sees a survalance tape where she sees Lecter she tries to warn Pazzi in Florance not to go after him cause Pazzi is trying to catch him & get the reward money. While is trying to take Hannibal down Pazzi gets trapped he gets a brutal death. A cop is checking the area to see if Hannibal is ok of couse he did it & we get a good gore effect with the throat slicing. Clarice calls to try & warn Pazzi again but Hannibal is on the other end & we get "Hello Clarice." Hannibal travels to the US stalks Paul Krendler & Clarice. There is a great scene in the mall where Lecter is playing mind games with Clarice but some guys working for Verger capture him Clarice trakcs them down but is hurt & it then results in Verger & his henchies being eaten by these hogs or whaterver. Hannibal takes Krendler & drugs him Clarice too we get a Hannibal style dinner with a great effect with the brain. The screen play had to be rewritten 15 times which I'm going to admit there are some problems. At this time it had the highest body count of any Hannibal movie. Christopher Reeve was offered the role of Verger but he dropped out of the project. After Jodie Foster & Jonathon Demme dropped out of the project Hopkins was reluctant to reprise his role. David Fincher was slated to direct but dropped out I can understand cause of bad luck with 3rd installments. Hopkins had no say in who would play Clarice. Reviews were mixed. Over 30 minutes of footage was cut some of it was put back in for the TV version. Ridley Scott did good enough cause he was directing a sequel to Silence Of The Lambs. Anthony Hopkins was great they were going for a slasher icon vibe but I was ok with that & I was fine with upping the gore. Julianne Moore was alright I'd rather had played a different character she looked sort of like Jodie Foster but she played too different from her. I mean they could've changed some of the plot points around made it a sequel to Silence & made her, her own character. So no where near as good as Manhunter or Silence but at best it's decent sequel & I'd say go for the 2 disc version.</p></body></html>

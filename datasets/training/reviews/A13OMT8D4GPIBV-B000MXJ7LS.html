<meta name="summary" content="A NIce Tribute to the Heroes of 9/11"></head><body><p>This is a very well put together film.  It's a nice tribute to our country (US) and the heroes of that day.  Though it's not as moving as other moovies made about the subject, it definitely is a wonderful movie.  Oliver Stone does a good job with this project.<br /><br />This DVD is excellent.  It has all the features of the single disc, plus an extra disc of content, including plenty of other features that are definitely worth your time.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.</p></body></html>

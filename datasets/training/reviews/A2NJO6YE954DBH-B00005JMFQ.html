Curtis has previously written the screenplays for &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; and &quot;Notting Hill,&quot; along with the adaptation of &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary,&quot; along with a slew of &quot;Blackadder&quot; and &quot;Bean&quot; scripts (which explains the choice bits for Rowan Atkinson).  With &quot;Love Actually&quot; (is all around, is the rest of the title we see in the opening credits) Curtis tries his hand as director as well and apparently gives himself permission to work in every idea for a plot that he had come up with recently.  I have seen several descriptions of this film talking about their being eight couples, but there are at least nine plots lines which collide with each other in various ways at various points in the film.  All of them have them moments and it will be interesting for couples who see this film to pick and choose which three story lines they like the best.<br /><br />Curtis sets the range of tone for this film in the first two sequences.  During the title credits Hugh Grant makes a poignant comment about September 11th that evokes an emotional response from many audience members and then we are confronted with the spectacle of over aged rocker Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) turning a familiar song into a holiday exploitation number.  The laughter outweighs the tears in what follows over the next 135 minutes, but there are ample opportunities for both (I had no idea the film was that long, I was too busy enjoying it).  Curtis juggles all the plotlines effortlessly, buoyed by the fact that all of them are interesting and we have a strong rooting interest in several of them as we follow them through the four weeks before Christmas.  However, do not be fooled into thinking that everybody gets a happy ending, because that is not the case, whether they deserve it or not.  Still, there are enough endings to go around (maybe even more than &quot;The Return of the King&quot;), and it is good to remember that sometimes the triumph of love is a peck on the cheek.  <p>There seems little reason to review the plot lines, because there are just so many, and no need to tell you which parts were my favorite because you should make up your own mind.  The cast alone should be enough to get your interested in this one.  I commented that it had three of the four leads from &quot;Sense and Sensibility,&quot; only to see the fourth one pop up (sort of).  True, I have trouble believing Hugh Grant is the Prime Minister of England, but that is a minor concern.  Mostly it is the relative newcomers that standout, including Andrew Lincoln as Mark, Martine McCutcheon as Natalie, and Thomas Sangster as Sam.  Another fun part of this film is all the recognizable faces who pop up at interesting moments (you will need the fingers on both hands to count them).  Be forewarned that this is a British comedy, which means naked bodies are usually funny rather than sexy, which is a shame only because there are parts in this film kids would like but their parents will not let them see because of the other parts.  Also, be prepared to stop at a store on the way home to pick up the soundtrack, because the music is a big part of this film and you have to find a way to get Billy Mack's song out of your mind.  <p>I can also tell you that my wife laughed louder and cried more often than at any movie we have ever seen.  In fact, I was told I had to get the DVD for her for Christmas, so stick a fork in me, because I am done.  On the other hand, on the other side of the two bridges I can see from our windows is Wisconsin...</p></body></html>

I just watched this last night for the second time since my wife had yet to see it and I was stunned for the second time at how well she carries herself in a film.  The story revolves around John Creasy (Washington) who had a troubled past and is now trying to find redemption.  His best friend Roy (Walken, who is great as usual) finds him a job as a bodyguard for young Pita (Fanning).  Her father (Marc Anthony, who in my opinion should never be seen) is a man with many secrets, but none of which I will tell you.  So, when his Incurence Agent Jorden (Rourke) suggest he get a bodyguard for the family he chooses Creasy becasue although he may be good, he's a drunk and so he's cheap.  At first Creasy is cold, distant even towards Pita, but they soon form a very close friendship and that is slashed to pieces when Pita is kidnapped and Creasy is hospitalized.  While Creasy is under there is a deal made that goes sour and Creasy is informed that young Pita is now dead.  He is determined to bring vengence (death) to all those who were involved, who profited from and or who knew about the kidnapping.  This film is intense, dramatic and one edge of your seat ride that is thuroughly enjoyable.</p></body></html>

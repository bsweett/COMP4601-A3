<meta name="summary" content="NOT FOR EVERYONE (INCLUDING ME)"></head><body><p>The problem with people who could not get themselves to like this doozy film is that they were expecting it to be like the graphic novel that inspired it. <p>The only attributes the film retains are the period, the plot summary (at a very simplified level) and the basic cast of characters. If you're expecting the characterization of the literary comic figures, well that isn't happening either. <p>The best I can about this film is that I was not disappointed. There's plenty of action, a surprise bad guy, and some pretty spiffy special fx. <p>Watch it as a no-expectations thriller with a twist and you'll do fine. Taken on its own merits, it's a decent way to while away an hour or two.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining retread film"></head><body><p>For the summer of 2005, it will be known as the "summer of movie retreads, reruns and lack of an original thought". The movie The Island proves to be a pretty decent popcorn movie. There is nothing here that any movie fan haven't seen before. The cast were great and they were the reason why I enjoyed the movie to a certain level. Sean Bean, Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johansson and rest were quite good and they made the movie worthwhile. However, the script and the story proves to be quite a letdown. I don't think Michael Bay did a good job directing here and the action sequences seem to be bit too predictable and some what boring.<br /><br />This movie proves to be a direct take-off from the 1979 movie called the "Parts: Clonus Horror", an awful B level film that few ever saw. The story of that movie have people cloning themselves for spare parts. Gee, that sound just like The Island!<br /><br />This movie should provides some entertainment for the undemanding audience out there. The first part of the movie was actually quite good, reminded me of the Brave New World type of concept. But once the chase sequences began, its all alot of bullets flying around, hitting everyone but the two stars. It turned into a your typical shoot'em up type of film, losing it all for just cheap thrills. Personally speaking, I think this would make a decent DVD rental but its not worth real money to see.</p></body></html>

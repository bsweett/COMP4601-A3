<meta name="summary" content="JULIA'S BEST TO DATE"></head><body><p>I was genuinely surprised to find Julia Roberts, who is difficult not to enjoy in any movie, immersing herself into the role of Erin -- her entire body language is different, as is her demeanor. She deserves an Oscar nod for this rousing movie, which only sporadically becomes a Hollywood-ish version of the truth.  The story, mostly true, is richly compelling, as are the characters of Erin, Ed (her boss, deftly played by an older, jollier Albert Finney) and George (Erin's too-good-to-be-true biker boyfriend, who is dashingly handsome beneath the ponytail).  For all of her alarmingly, and entertainingly over the top costumes, Julia's personal beauty has never radiated with as many layers as it does in this terrific story of a &quot;nobody&quot; who has the guts, determination, pride and smarts to take on the Establishment in a big way.  Her natural warmth works spectacularly well with the sad victims she tends to; the movie as a whole makes you want to cheer!</p></body></html>

Third movie's were big this year and each one of them got their share of bad reviews. I don't know why? Maybe the Hype? Or third time being a charm.....NOT! or expectations running too high making it impossible to meet them. I think that must be it. I thought this Shrek was very entertaining but, maybe a little simpler in story. It is a worthy installment and the animation is simply beautiful! Lots of fun with adult references/buff jokes throughout like all the Shrek films. Can anyone name one third installment movie that was better than the first two films in a series?.......No? .....exactly. I don't think it has ever been done. By the time you get to a third installment it's hard to keep it really fresh because we have "been there done that". This film is very good and I recommend buying it. The DVD transfer is excellent and the extras are interesting.</p></body></html>

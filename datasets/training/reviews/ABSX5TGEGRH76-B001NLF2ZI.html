<meta name="summary" content="Great Set-up Leads To A So-So Ending"></head><body><p>The first time that I saw a preview for this film, I thought to myself, "Nicole Kidman looks great in that".  That's about it.  The previews kind of made it look like a generic movie that everyone has seen dozens of times already.  Then it was released, and good press started to come in by the barrelful.  So I decided to check it out after all.  As the title of this review suggests, for the most part, this is a pretty good political thriller, but it kinds of runs out of gas at the end.  I don't know, maybe the writer couldn't come up with a good ending twist.  Whatever the case was, it's too bad, because with a better ending, this could have been a memorable classic in years to come.<br /><br />Anyway, the story centers around Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), an African-born Caucasian who is filled with a desire for change in her homeland, but has chosen to do so with words rather than bullets.  She has become an interpreter for the United Nations (this is the very first movie to actually shoot on location at the UN building).  One night, while retrieving some of her belongings, she overhears some people discussing an assasination of a much-hated leader in Broome's home country.<br /><br />When Broome reports this, US Secret Service assigns Agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) to protect/interrogate her.  Keller, while a very good agent, is a little on edge, due to problems involving his wife.  He is so ridden with angst and despair that he calls his own telephone number in order to hear his wife's voice on the answering machine.<br /><br />As time goes on, the pair gets more and more involved in the conspiracy as people try to frighten them away from investigating the matter further.  Along the way, we discover some interesting facts from Silvia's past.<br /><br />Both Kidman and Penn give great performances in their respective roles, and the acting is pretty good all around.  As I already stated, this is the first time that the actual interiors of the UN building has appeared in a movie, and they are definitely a sight to behold.  The one thing is that the ending didn't really do it for me.  It seemed as if the writers took the easy way out instead of coming up with something truly shocking.<br /><br />I guess I would still recomend this movie, although I do think that it is being slightly overhyped.</p></body></html>

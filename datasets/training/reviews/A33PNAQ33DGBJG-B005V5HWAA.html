Kevin Costner and William Hurt are in their prime in this movie. The content of the movie is about a man obessesed with killing and then finds out he has passed that obessesion down to his daughter. I am apprehensive to say it is a good movie because of the content but as far as acting and drama with suspense...it is a good movie.</p></body></html>

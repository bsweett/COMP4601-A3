<meta name="summary" content="One of the best DVDs yet"></head><body><p>Fox has really outdone itself this time by releasing a DVD so full of content that you could spend literally hours reading and watching all the content. There are storyboards galore, many, many, trailers and TV spots, and several featurettes, and of course, the alternate ending. The movie deals with alien invaders taking out all the major cities, and it's up to a group of survivors led by the president to take out spaceships. This is a very fun movie, especially with the 5.1 sound. You will not believe how much better this movie is with digital sound! It feels like you are in the cockpit with will smith! This DVD is a great buy.</p></body></html>

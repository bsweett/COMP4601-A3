She was someone women could relate to and perhaps laugh at her flightiness and in turn make the rest of us feel better that we are not in her shoes. However, watching the film version of Bridget Jones: The Edge or Reason was like watching a parody of the aforementioned anti-heroine. Almost every scene in the sequel centers on Bridget Jones going through humiliating moments that are too over the top at times. There were some poignant and sweet moments with Bridget and Mark Darcy, but they were few and far in between. The plot also seems bloated, like the editors tried to add as many elements of the book as possible in 110 minutes. And the solution regarding relationship interloper Rebecca is too contrived and simplified for my taste. Also, the elements of Jane Austen's Persuasion that were in the book are missing here.  What happened?  The first book had been inspired by Austen's Pride and Prejudice and said inspiration was also apparent in the movie.  This is yet another major flaw in this film. But despite the aforementioned things, the movie was indeed funny and entertaining and Renee Zellwegger (who gained more weight to do this film than she did in the first one) and gorgeous Colin Firth had great chemistry. Hugh Grant is always fun to watch whenever he plays a bad boy. Grant is more believable in the aforementioned roles than he is when he plays the boy next door type of characters he played in Notting Hill and Love Actually. All in all, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason is not as good as the Helen Fielding novels or as good as the first movie and I'd advise you to rent the DVD before you buy it.</p></body></html>

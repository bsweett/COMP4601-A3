Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) live out the classic love story.  He is in love with her, but she is usually unavailable or uninterested.  There are other fascinating storylines available, too.  The movie illuminates his difficult childhood with his brother's tragedy and his father's abuse.  We also feel the anguish of an artist before he becomes famous.  He must start with an unfulfilling marriage and an unrewarding sales job before he gets to become fulfilled in life.  The steps after success aren't always uplifting either.  He goes through infidelity, drinking, and drug abuse before he sees the light of what success and happiness can really garner.<br /><br />Perenially, it has been said that the performances in "Walk the Line" are remarkable.  True enough.  The story's presentation is marvelous, though, too.  It could have been assembled any way, but we start and end with the "Folsum Prison" concert, creating the anticipation and closure we need.  The country music performances are intertwined with scenes about John and June's relationship, and all of it is worthwhile.  While many comments have been made about Joaquin's reinactment of the music, it is engaging enough to work well.  (Subjectively, one of the best scenes in the movie is when Joaquin and Reese perform "It Ain't Me Babe," a Bob Dylan song.)  "Walk the Line" is an excellent movie that doesn't require the viewer to like country music (although it certainly helps). The movie is a sincere and flattering portrait of an honest and uncompromising man who was genuine and human enough to represent the tragedies and concerns of all people who struggle in daily life.  The movie doesn't make a legend, but it certainly celebrates one.</p></body></html>

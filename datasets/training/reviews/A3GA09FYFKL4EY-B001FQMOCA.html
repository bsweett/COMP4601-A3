<meta name="summary" content="Stunning performances, classic music"></head><body><p>Covering the career of a legend is never an easy task, but this film more than delivers. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon deliver believable and incredible performances as Johnny and June Carter Cash and completely fooled this reviewer, who was astonished to find that their vocals weren't dubbed.<br /><br />It's a bit disappointing that more of Cash's early life isn't covered, especially his turbulent relationship with his father, but this is, after all more about his romance with June, which survived his battles with drinking and drugs and the turmoil of being a celebrity. Honest and forthright, this is a heartwarming tribute to one of the most enduring love affairs in country music history. Can't say enough good things about this movie. It's a pity that Johnny and June didn't live to see it, but they've earned immortality through their music. Five stars</p></body></html>

This is actually one of my all-time favorites. I usually find myself disappearing into this movie during flu season and when I'm confined to the couch for a week suffering in pain. Watching Forrest Gump seems to make things better, sooner.<br /><br />While that might sound corny, and you might be rolling your eyes, I usually feel better every time just watching it. The truth about the success of this movie is that most people identify with it, because unless you're a sycophantic sociopath, there are many times when the majority of us feel inferior, or less than or unable to meet the demands of our life - rendering us a little blue, sad, debilitated ... take your pick. Knowing that there is someone in the world like Forrest, probably gives us the hope that you're going to be alright if you hang on and don't obsess on your flaws. Forrest Gump is a lot of different things to different people. Mostly, it just takes you out of whatever you're in and does a pretty consistent job at making you feel that much better. Even if it's just for a little while.<br /><br />I'll spare you the repetitious information regarding any technical information about the DVD or the cast, as to date there are 543 reviews on this, 397 "5 star" and 42 "1 star", and 10 pages of posts on IMDb.<br /><br />Another reviewer stated that this was an introspective look into the Baby Boomers generation, and while I've never been a fan of the Baby Boomers per se, as most of the would-be flower children that briefly took up residences in communes, would later switch-off and drift into the largest group of corporate raiders in the history of this nation. Not much of a legacy there. But the character of Forrest speaks to more than just one single generation, or even one single man or one journey. Forrest Gump is an amalgam of several people, this according to Winston Groom and the reason why so many people identify with it. While <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743453255">the book</a> is a worthy and interesting read, the film trumps.<br /><br />"I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is ..."</p></body></html>

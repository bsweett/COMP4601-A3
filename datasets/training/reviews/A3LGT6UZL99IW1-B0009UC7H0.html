<meta name="summary" content="Average adventure flick that has no resemblance to the book"></head><body><p>The plot was more twisted and looping than a bowl of spaghetti - and not in a good way. I swear that Pen&eacute;lope Cruz could not make up her mind on what accent to try and fake.  Am I ghetto French?  Perhaps I'll try an African/English hint.  Ooh - lets go for .....<br /><br />Dirk - well, he resembled the Dirk we know from the novels in one way - the name.  That's it.<br /><br />Al - Could they have picked a worse person to play him?  Instead of being a wise-cracking rock-solid individual, he's a blithering idiot that looks like a surfer-bar reject. Look at the CD cover - see the dimwit on the right? What do you think?<br /><br />Sandecker was passable, but 50 lbs too light and a little too swishy.<br /><br />The entire film is an exercise in miscsasting.  Sore, if you've never read the books, you'll think this is an OK move.  Weak plot, poorly executed, badly acted, but passable. The opening scene was well done with believable SFX.  Unfortunately the rest on the movie did not even come close.  I found myself using the >> control many, many times to get past the weakest moments, so at least I was able to enjoy this as a 40 minute movie.</p></body></html>

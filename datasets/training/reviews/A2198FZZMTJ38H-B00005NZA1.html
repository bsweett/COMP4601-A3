<meta name="summary" content="Breathtaking! Shyamalan continues to shine!"></head><body><p>M. Night Shyamalan struck a gold mine when his film &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; was released in 1999, bringing in overwhelming audiences and garnering Oscar nominations including a nod for Best Picture. It is one of the films that will go down in history, not so much as a movie like, for instance, &quot;Titanic,&quot; but still will be remembered. <p>&quot;Unbreakable,&quot; his follow-up feature to that success, didn't do as good as its predecessor, and upon watching it for the first time, I can't understand why. There are elements at work throughout its discourse that, under Shyamalan's brilliant direction, fit together in an intricate puzzle that comes to an earth-shattering halt with the film's ending. It's a brilliant and complex piece of filmmaking. <p>Like &quot;Sense,&quot; this film contains a mystery surrounding a central character, though this one isn't haunted by ghosts who need favors. &quot;Unbreakable&quot; begins with a horrific train accident, seen only through television footage and through the gauze of the last dying passenger as the sole survivor, David Dunn (Bruce Willis), looks on in a dazed silence. There is no scene of gory bloodshed, no sequence of special effects or derailing train cars... Shyamalan is able to prove that, through visceral images of victims' relatives and their expressions, the devastation of such an event can be just as effective without the use of a special effect. <p>As the story continues, more pieces of David's life come into play: his marriage is suffering, he goes into deep depression, and that, added to questions he has about the fact that he suffered no injuries, not even so much as a single scratch, plague him each day. His work as a security guard seems like any other job to him, until he meets a man named Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson), who believes that comic book heroes walk the Earth. <p>Elijah's life also has many complications: he suffers from a disease which causes his bones to break easily, ever since childbirth. His belief stems from his illness, that just as he is someone who is completely weak, there must be someone on the opposite end of the spectrum who is equally as strong. As he guides David through to the realization of his place in the world, a bigger revelation is at work, someone even as strong as David cannot withstand. <p>In a slow, emotional process, Shyamalan brings out the best and worst of his characters. In taking his time with the story, he is able to allow David to evolve from a hardened, unbelieving survivor into someone forever changed by the realization that the he possesses can be put to good use. I'm not going to reveal just how he comes to that realization: that's for you to find out. But I will say this: it's sheer brilliance. <p>The story structure for this film bears striking resemblance to &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; but does not fail in keeping us intrigued. It begins by introducing the characters, and developing them in the midst of a very involving mystery. It then evolves into a story of realization and revelation, and just as in the previous film, there's a surprise twist ending, one that is more shocking and unexpected. <p>Shyamalan made the right choice in bringing Bruce Willis back for this project; one could even go so far as to say that the part was written especially for him. Once again, Willis is able to define himself as a true actor, one that can go from the guns and bombs of &quot;Die Hard&quot; to the sentimentality of a man whose belief in everything is shaken in this film. Cast opposite him is Samuel L. Jackson as Elijah, who also proves he is just as effective in a wheelchair as he is on his feet. <p>So why would this film not be as great a success as its predecessor? The answer may lie with the audience. &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; drew many crowds of various types of people, the kind of people who generally don't see movies of this sort. &quot;Unbreakable&quot; is a much darker film, and I guess that was a turnoff for some people. <p>But who cares? &quot;Unbreakable&quot; is everything you'd expect out of a movie and more. There's the same subtle suspense and rising intensity you'd expect from its director, the same magic, the same awe-inspiring brilliance. Everything fits together, it's dynamic, it's intriguing. There's not enough praise for a movie like this, one of the best films of 2000.</p></body></html>

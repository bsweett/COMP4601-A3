<meta name="summary" content="A Gothic Thriller Delivered with Panache"></head><body><p>Writer Ehren Kruger ('The Ring' movies, 'The Brothers Grimm') has supplied Director Iain Softley ('Wings of the Dove') with a sound story from which Softley has created a satisfyingly dark film about death and dying and Hoodoo magic in the swampy region of Louisiana. Without resorting to the usual stock gimmicks, THE SKELETON KEY works on many levels to frighten and entertain and it succeeds!<br /><br />Caroline (Kate Hudson) is a beautiful 25-year old whose guilt over her absence from her father's deathbed has driven her to seek work in nursing homes (the film's opening sequence with Caroline reading to a dying man is elegant and touching and quite timely) and ultimately to hospice care. Answering an ad in the paper for a hospice nurse takes her to a strange old Southern mansion in which live the Devereauxs - Violet (Gena Rowlands) and her bedridden husband Ben (John Hurt). Caroline passes her interview and at the warm insistence of the family lawyer Luke (Peter Sarsgaard) she takes the job. Violet is a frightening old lady who entrusts Caroline with a skeleton key which opens the doors of all 30 rooms of the creaky, musty mansion - except for one door in the attic. Noting there are no mirrors in the house, Caroline begins to investigate the place and Ben's seemingly terrified state and discovers the forbidden room contains elements of dark magic. She seeks information from her close friend Jill (Joy Bryant) who skeptically informs her that the symbols and paraphernalia Caroline has discovered are factors of Hoodoo - a strange magic whose multiethnic beginnings are in New Orleans. Slowly Caroline challenges Violet for information and finding none, seeks the advice of a Hoodoo woman (Fahnlohnee R. Harris) for answers. The bizarre dark secrets of the old mansion and the Devereaux couple ultimately come into focus and it is up to Caroline to break some spells....if that is possible.<br /><br />With a cast this fine it would be surprising if the film didn't fly and each of the actors creates a credible creature that involves us from the beginning. Yes, the horror story is accompanied by rain storms and thunder storms that serve to heighten the tension and the pacing by director Softley keeps the audience alert and suspicious and ultimately surprised. This is one of the better thrillers released in some time. Recommended especially to devotees of the thriller genre! Grady Harp, November 05</p></body></html>

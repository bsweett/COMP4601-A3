<meta name="summary" content="A la Indiana Jones!"></head><body><p>I watched The Mummy because first, it looked like an Indiana Jones type of movie &amp; secondly, I like Brendan Fraser.  Meeting my two reasons with satisfaction, I thoroughly enjoyed watching the film.  Brendan was funny &amp; like Harrison Ford, he fought his way through &amp; saved the &quot;damsel in distress&quot; as well as obtained their objective/goal.<p>The movie has great effects &amp; it would surely bring you on a rollercoaster adventure.</p></body></html>

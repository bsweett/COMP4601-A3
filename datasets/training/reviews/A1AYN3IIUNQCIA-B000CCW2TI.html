<meta name="summary" content="a tense-white knucle ride"></head><body><p>red eye was a sleeper hit for me cuase it is coming from wes craven, one of the best horror directors of all time. neatly rebounding from cursed, craven treats us with a short but super tense movie, the shortness comes in handy cause the real flaw with most thriller movies is there to long and falter on suspense, this movie skips that and gives u the real deal, taught suspense. the story is simple, a woman on a red-eye to atlanta is cought up in a assasination attemp and is a key player in the plan to move he target at the hotel she works at and position him in the right place. mcadams has become one of my favorite actresses after her breakthrough in mean girls while murphy makes his character ripner come to life with haunting precence. if ur looking for a wild ride then check out red eye.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="CLASSIC MASTERPIECE"></head><body><p>A surgeon is wrongly accused of his own wifes murder which leads to him going on the run in order to find the real killer while at the same time being hunted by a ruthless cop.<p>Tense, gripping, exciting and packed with suspense and surprise twists to the plot are the best ways to describe this thoroughly excellent and classic thriller which was based on the vintage American T.V series of the same name. Excellent cast here with Harrison Ford in the title role, who gives the character the realism and depth needed to pull a challenging film like this off. Also in the cast is Tommy Lee Jones who is equally excellent as the ruthless cop on the trail of Ford and also Sela Ward, Joe Pantoliano and Julianne Moore.<p>Keith Barish and Arnold Ropelson pull off this thriller triumphantly. Its a real winner! A classic masterpiece which earnt Tommy Lee Jones an oscar for Best Actor. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!</p></body></html>

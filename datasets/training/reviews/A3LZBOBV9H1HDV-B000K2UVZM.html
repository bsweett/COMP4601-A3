Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson, Aaron Eckhart, and Hilary Swank are excellent and lead an impressive cast. Brian De Palma's (one of the best directors of our time and one of the underlooked directors, Oscar-wise and Golden Globe-wise), who has directed movies like "Scarface" (1983), "The Untouchables" (1987), & "Blow Out" (1981) directing is excellent, as usual, as is his visual style and impressive camerawork, as usual. The screenplay by Josh Friedman (who adapted the H.G. Wells' novel & the Steven Spielberg film "War Of The Worlds" (2005) to the screen) is excellent! The music by Mark Isham (who also did the music to "Invincible" (2006), "Eight Below" (2006), "Running Scared" (2006), the upcoming "Bobby" (2006) & "Crash" (2005) is excellent! The cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond (who won an Oscar for his work on Spielberg's "Close Encounters Of The Third Kind" (1977) and also has worked on De Palma's "Bonfire Of The Vanties" (1990), "Obsession" (1976) & "Blow Out") is excellent and impressive! The film editing by Bill Pankow (who worked on 10 of De Palma's films, such as, "Scarface" & "The Untouchables") is excellent! The casting by Lucy Boulting & Johanna Ray is excellent! The production design by Dante Ferretti (who won an Oscar for his work on Martin Scorsese's "The Aviator" (2004) is excellent! The art direction by Pier-Luigi Basile & Christopher Tandon is excellent! The set decoration by Elli Griff, Bruce L. Luizzi, & Rick Simpson is excellent! The costume design by Jenny Beavan (who won an Oscar for her work on "A Room With A View" (1986) is excellent! The visual look is impressive, the sets are impressive, the costumes are impressive, the look of the film is impressive. A excellent film that keeps you think and keeps you interested.</p></body></html>

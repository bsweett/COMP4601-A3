<meta name="summary" content="Good contemporary Vietnam film"></head><body><p>&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; is the true story of the 7th Airborne Cavalry as they landed in Vietnam lowlands at only regiment size...and found themselves under attack by four North Vietnamese divisions! It was the first moment the American military went at the North Vietnamese, mono y mono. It is told as a good, exciting narrative.<p>The battle scenes are fairly well done and you get a glimpse of front line hell, especially for the &quot;lost platoon&quot; that was stranded early in the battle. Also, contrary to what some of the other reviewers have said, you get a better side of the North Vietnamese than you do in some films. The book &quot;We Were Soldiers, Once and Young&quot; was written by the American colonel himself and he portrayed or spoke of the enemy in a well meaning tone, and while its hard to have compassion for the North Vietnamese (they are shooting at American soldiers, after all) you get a tiny glimpse at their lives and thoughts, centering around one particular soldier who writes love letters back home (Mel Gibson's character would later personally deliver his diary and letter to his wife after the war).<p>The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the scene with the military wives getting their letters back. Now...it wasn't the fact that they had the scenes at all, in fact I was perfectly fine with it - it showed what wives go through and what the time period then was like - however I guess the real problem I had was the pacing. It seemed to slow things down.<p>But it didn't really affect my thought for the movie too much. I still liked the battle scenes and the characters - in fact, Mel Gibson's character was almost a near mirror of my father. The scene where he explains war to his daughter was almost word for word how my father explained war to me when I was young. They also get military life down fairly well, and I think its good that at least ONE movie out there shows what life is like with a father in the military, and does it in a realistic manner. On a final, unrelated note, I believed &quot;Sgt. McKenzie&quot; was a fitting theme for this movie for its lyrics and meaning.<p>Overall, a good film about one of the most influential albeit underrated battles in American history.</p></body></html>

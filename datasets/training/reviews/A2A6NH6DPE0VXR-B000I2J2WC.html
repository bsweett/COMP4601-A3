Once I saw that **** review I thought many other reviews like that would follow. However I guess everyone else that gave it bad reviews are either overly Christian or have short attenion spans. Since some either complain about the length or the story itself. I even heard something about over-acting. Funny, I don't recall much over-acting here.<br /><br />  There's also reviews about it be boring with too much talking. Sure it's  convenient that they can get out every single thing they wanna say about history unknown to mankind before they are in danger again. However the book was like that too. Plus I didn't find all the talking boring. It' is faithful to the book and if everything the book says wasn't explained, the people watching the film that didn't read the book would be lost.<br /><br />  Besides listening to Ian McKellen talk in any movie isn't boring and of course it's not boring here either. Everything he says about Jesus may be silly and offending to some but....IT's FICTION!. People can be like "oh no, tell me he didn't just say that". When what is really so bad about what is being said ? I think it's selfish to just want to think that Jesus possibly couldn't of had a wife and kids and to totally be appauled by the thought. It doesn't make him any less special to me if it's true. Besides like I said...this is FICTION!, so hating the book and now the movie is the real silly thing. I think everyone that gave this bad reviews had it planned to hate it in the first place.<br /><br />  Yes the screenplay is done by Akiva Goldsman who wrote the screenplay for Batman & Robin. So of course critics had to throw that in there and say the movie sucks because of that too. I too expected the film to suck once I learned that but come on, there's no Batman & Robin like dialogue in this film. Of course the guy that wrote Batman & Robin isn't as good of a writer as Dan Brown but he doesn't do a bad job bringing Brown's work to the big screen either. If you're mad that he chose to have all the talking from the book then that's silly too.<br /><br />  The main characters are supposed to be talkers and brainy debators. While the actors play them how they should be played. This is a movie where you are supposed open your mind and heart and just think a little. If you want  a non-stop action summer movie, this isn't it but is it a bad summer movie ? No not at all. Is it a bad adaption of the Da Vinci Code ? No, it's everything it should be and Ron Howard is very faithful to the book and so are the actors. Newsday also called the film over-scored by Hans Zimmer , I couldn't disagree more. The score is wonderful and if the film wasn't soooo unfairly hated it would get  a best score nomination like it deserves. This is probably Ron Howards most unfairly hated film since Willow. While reading the book, the ending didn't do much for me but actually seeing it yourself, it's just beautiful and breathtaking and I loved it. So just give this film a chance and don't think it's your job of being a Christian to hate the film, just open your mind and sit back and relax.</p></body></html>

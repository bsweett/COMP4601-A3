<meta name="summary" content=""It doesn't taste like anything else, but it's very good!!!""></head><body><p>I had always been fascinated by Canadian actress Ellen Page, because she's very good, and she's by far one of the best actresses  of her generation. I wasn't not prepared to see her in such a nasty role, and I had assumed that she was playing a victim in this movie, at least she pretended to be. No wonder they put her in a red hoodie for the poster. This movie is shot mostly in a house and there is very few characters, even Sandra Oh had just one scene, still very striking. I don't want to reveal much about the story, but it's very disturbing for the second half when Patrick Wilson gets trapped by Ellen Page's game. It's kind of a psychological version torture movies like Hostel, but it's very disturbing and shocking without the blood and gore. Anyways, for a movie that relys mostly on the performance of two actors and one set, and no wardrobe change, and mostly dialogue driven plot, it's excellent! I must say that while this is possibly a star-making vehicle for Page, it also showcased a brilliant performance from Wilson, who by the way impressed my so much.</p></body></html>

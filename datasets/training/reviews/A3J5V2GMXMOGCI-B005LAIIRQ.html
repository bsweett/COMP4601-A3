<meta name="summary" content="A mortality movie"></head><body><p>Neeson is exceptionally good in this so-called survival movie, but it's dreamlike quality is going to turn off a lot of adventure folk.  A lot of decent thought went into the film, and though the wolf metaphor looms too large (they have a cheap horror-film presence), and the supporting characters are half-baked, Neeson manages to hold the story together, and this is some of his best work.  A romantic sense of doom is hard to capture without too much cornball spiritualism and hamfisted family values, but director Carnahan and company succeed admirably in this case.  Lots of howling, but definitely worth checking out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE BEST HIP HOP MOVIE IN A LONG TIME"></head><body><p>EMINEM PLAYS A RAPPER NAMED RABBIT WHO'S STRUGGLING IN HIS LIFE AT HOME IN DETROIT AND IS DESPERATELY TRYING TO MAKE A NAME FOR HIMSELF IN DETROIT'S HIP HOP UNDERGROUND CIRCUIT. GREAT MOVIE FROM BEGINNING TO END. THE RAP BATTLES ARE GREAT, IF NOT THE BEST THING ABOUT THE MOVIE. AND PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS MOVIE IS SOMEWHAT BASED ON EMINEM'S LIFE. EMINEM DOES A GREAT JOB PLAYING HIMSELF IN THIS MOVIE. THIS MOVIE INCLUDES APPEARANCES BY; PROOF OF D-12, XZIBIT, AND OBIE TRICE. FOR HIP HOP FANS, THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE.</p></body></html>

Though not the greatest sci fi action flick ever made ("Aliens" will always hold that title), it si still one of thebest pure action adventure movies ever made.<br /><br />Dutch (Schwarzenegger) and a covert rescue team are sent into the Central American jungle to infiltrate a hostage situation. By the time they arrive, the hostages have been killed and the terrorists are ready for attack. Fortunately, Dutch and his men are tough and ready, and blow them out of the water. However, there is something else out there. A creature that blends into the forest, unseen. A beast that is killing off the team one by one. A hunter.<br /><br />A predator.<br /><br />As the team members are continually killed by the creature, Dutch and a Central American named Anna (Elpidia Carrillo) are the only ones left. And when Anna is rescued, Dutch is determined to face the beast alone, and hope that he'll make it out alive.<br /><br />This special edition is loaded with bonus features, but it's the film that you will want to watch again and again.</p></body></html>

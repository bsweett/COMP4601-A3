"People better start taking better care of the environment or the environment will 'take care' of you!" If not you have a choice: You can watch and listen to the case Al Gore makes for a planet in trouble in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICL3KG">An Inconvenient Truth</a>, or you can watch The Happening...M. Night Shyamalan's fantasy about when plants and trees go wild.<br /><br />Al Gore at least makes a pretty good case for "cleaning up our act" here on Mother Earth. Of course there's the partisan Democrat/Republican thing getting in the way of Al's message.<br /><br />Then you have M. Night's version that needs some act cleaning up of its own. Marky Mark Wahlberg turns in his worst performance ever...even the horrible music that he made with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001Y5A">Marky Mark & The Funky Bunch</a> is easier to listen to than watching Wahlberg in The Happening. And Wahlberg gets absolutely zero redeeming value from his supporting cast.<br /><br />The story line is that vegetation rebels and develops a defense mechanism to stop humans for creating things that "are bad for the planet." The defense mechanism being an airborne toxin (I call it tree pollen...was this allergy season brutal or WHAT!) that makes people commit suicide in gruesome ways. The special effects of this are amazing to watch (sarcasm)!...Picture expansive shots of trees blowing in the wind. No the budget for this movie did NOT go over.<br /><br />This movie about trees that go to war with humans drags on for an hour and a half. Look, I even get the fact the Shayamalan meant this to be a sort of "B-esque" movie. But there was no dark humor, no humor and no unintentional humor. Usually you get one of the three in a B movie.<br /><br />If warring trees is something you'd like to fantasize about, I recommend a much shorter, 4 minute and 45 second listen to Rush's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W1ZGDI">The Trees</a>. "There is unrest in the forest; there is trouble with the trees!" Skip The Happening.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Poor effort by DePalma"></head><body><p>It is hard to believe that Brian DePalma directed this film. The best thing that you can say about the film is that the period sets, clothes and language are well done. Unfortunately, the film is grossly miscast, terribly confusing and the title is misleading. The Black Dahlia murder is almost a mere footnote in this film. Most of the story focuses on the lives of 2 cops that stumble into the Dahlia crime scene. Josh Hartnett just wanders through the film and Hilary Swank is horribly miscast as a femme fatale. The plot is so confusing that, by the end of the film, you just want all the characters to die. This film makes your brain hurt. Sorry, Brian.</p></body></html>

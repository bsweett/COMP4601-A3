Upon arrival, he finds out that the entire town is gripped by superstitious terror. It seems that these were no ordinary killings, and the killer is far from ordinary himself! A headless horeseman roams this place, seeking heads for his collection. The logical Ichabod soon realizes that he's dealing with the supernatural when he comes face to... um, well, shoulders with the dreaded horseman. He figures out that these are not random murders at all, but part of some diabolical conspiracy! Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) is a young, beautiful witch, who is either out to help or hurt Mr. Crane. Weird happenings, ultra-creepy atmosphere, and perfect casting, make SH a horror classic! Tim Burton has cooked up a comic / gothic brew of darkness and dreamlike imagery. Miranda Richardson is perfectly wicked as Mrs. Van Tassel. Also, check out Christopher Walken as the hessian! Christopher Lee even makes a cameo as the Burgomaster! Best when viewed near halloween or any time past midnight. Highly recommended...</p></body></html>

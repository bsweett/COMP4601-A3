<meta name="summary" content="Underworld: Evolution is a step beyond the first film"></head><body><p>The war between the vampire covens and their former servants the Lycans (werewolves) continues! Underworld: Evolution immediately follows the events of the first film. After dicing head bloodsucker Viktor's head in uneven halves, the sexy and undead Death Dealer Selene is on the run from her fellow vampires, her only ally the werewolf-vampire hybrid Michael Corvin. With the most sadistic vampire of all, Marcus Corvinus, having just awakened from his long dormant state, the hunt for the two fugitives figures to be all the more savage and unyielding. Marcus also has the added agenda of desiring to liberate his centuries-long captive twin brother, William, who is revealed to be the first ever werewolf and the most depraved. Selene and Michael settle even more firmly in between Marcus's crosshairs when they attempt to prevent William's release. But, with the help of the oldest immortal alive, the beautiful ex-Death Dealer and the human-turned-beastie just might have the slimmest of chances to succeed.<br /><br />Selene's persona this time isn't as mechanical, giving Kate Beckinsale more opportunities to emote. Fueled perhaps by her kind's betrayal and a bit by her blossoming relationship with Michael, Selene seems more invested emotionally with the goings-on around her. Kate has never looked better or deadlier in her black leathers, thanks in large part to director Len Wiseman, who also doubles as her husband. And yes, for all the red-blooded guys and multitudes of perverts out there, Kate is shown in one tasteful love scene about 37 minutes into the movie. But it's one of those scenes where you think you see more of Kate's tangibles than was really shown. I still don't think much of Speedman's earnest acting style, considering it merely substantial fluff. I gotta admit, though, that his werewolf guise can kick beaucoup butt. Meanwhile, British supporting actors Bill Nighy, Tony Curran and Steven Mackintosh lend substance to the proceedings. Call me shallow but an English accent always seems to give instant verisimilitude to a cinematic effort. The signing of upper echelon British thespian Derek Jacobi is a coup of sorts for the horror genre. As the father of Marcus and William, his character, Alexander Corvinus, is suitably grave, commanding and manipulating. Is it a coincidence that, with the influx of British actors, the plotline suddenly takes a decidedly Shakespearean turn?<br /><br />Where the first Underworld had dead spots and stale action sequences, Underworld: Evolution is as gothically gorgeous to look at, but is leaner, more absorbing and just plain better. The sequel delves more deeply into the Underworld history and mythology and defines Selene's place in it. For action and f/x fans, the truck chase scene is a must-see, as are most of the battle sequences, to be honest. A familiarity with the first movie is recommended as the dense backstory and the several flashbacks to the original film might bewilder those fresh to the franchise. One thing that bugs me about the film, though, is where are all the other vampires that are supposedly after Selene? Marcus seems to be the only one chasing her.<br /><br />Special features include: a filmmakers' commentary, "The Hybrid Theory" (visual effects featurette), "The War Rages On" (stunts featurette), "Bloodlines: From Script to Screen" (a decent making-of featurette), "Making Monsters Roar" (creature featurette), "Building a Saga" (production design featurette), "Music & Mayhem" (music and sound design featurette), "Her Portrait In Black" (a headbangin' music video by Atreyu).<br /><br />This is a really gory, vastly entertaining action-horror flick. The "Evolution" in the title, by the way, refers more to Selene than to Michael. You'll see.</p></body></html>

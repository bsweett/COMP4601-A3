<meta name="summary" content="Stop remaking Japanese films!"></head><body><p>Hollywood are rapidly running out of ideas when it comes to new films, and have been remaking Japanese films. This one is all too similar to The Ring, but has some pretty good jump scenes in it. But it's instantly forgettable, and Sarah Michelle Gellar just does not work. It's ridiculous that regular people can't go see the original versions of films, they probably would more, if Hollywood wasn't so determined to remake films, and put American actors in just to make it more viewer friendly. What utter nonsense.<br /><br />The only good thing about this film was the little boy who appears. He is so creepy. I jumped so many times, he's a talented actor for someone so young, and can show so much with just his eyes. It's also very well edited, and is quick enough to make you think "did I just see that?"<br /><br />There's too many of your usual horror movie cliches in this, including looking for something in an attic with only a lighter to light your way and a character following another character that shouldn't or isn't there in the first place. There's also no character development, and it took me a wee while to work out why the character had done what he did in the first place. In fact, I'm still not sure what happened. Most of the characters are severely underused, Bill Pullman & Clea Duvall being the main two, and instead all the focus is on Sarah Michelle Gellar. Who just doesn't work in this kinda role. I know she appeared in many episodes of Buffy, but I've never seen it, so I can't compare. There just wasn't something right. Her face was also very distracting, there's something NOT right with her nose. It's almost like she's been under the knife, cos I don't remember her nose being like that!<br /><br />The timeline just doesn't make any sense to me, there's a couple of different storylines happening, which are linked, but one storyline is going forwards in time, and another is going backwards. Get your head around that one if you will.<br /><br />This isn't an enjoyable film. It starts off with a apparently unexplained suicide, and then carries on. Just pay attention, and be freaked out.</p></body></html>

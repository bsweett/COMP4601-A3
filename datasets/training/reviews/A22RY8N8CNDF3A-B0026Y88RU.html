<meta name="summary" content="Smart, Stylish Thriller -"></head><body><p>"Lucky Number Sleven" is a story about names, mistaken identity and revenge.  This thriller mystery has gives a fast and clever ride with visual treats popping up throughout.  The story starts in the 1970's showing a family man caught up in a fixed horse race.  He loses all he has to face a bookie debt of $22,000.  He is beaten up and killed by hit men while his son waits in the car for him to return from the race.<br /><br />Then we fast forward to the present time and a slender Sleven (Josh Hartnett) arrives at his friend Nick's apartment in New York.  Sleven has been mugged and his wallet stolen, and he enters Nick's unlocked apartment.  Nick has disappeared, so Sleven makes himself at home and takes a shower.  Soon a cute and perky neighbor Lindsey (Lucy Liu) pops in to borrow a cup of sugar to find Sleven fresh out of the shower in a purple flower towel - the scene with the towel is way too long.  However, the dialogue is sweet, smart and sassy between the two and they "click".  Lindsey feels that something bad has happened to Nick and starts her own private investigation to find Nick while Sleven mulls what to do without his wallet.<br /><br />After Lindsey leaves for work, Sleven is kidnapped and taken to meet with one of Manhattan's two most feared crime bosses (Morgan Freeman).  The Boss thinks Sleven is Nick who owes him $96,000 and forces him to agree to kill the son of his main rival, the Rabbi (Ben Kingsley) within three days.  This is because he believes the Rabbi has killed his son.  Sleven is wise-cracking throughout, which seemed odd, but the plot is complicated and surprising at several points.  After meeting with the Boss, Sleven is again kidnapped and meets with the Rabbi.  The Rabbi says Nick owes him $33,000 and in order to pay him off gets a murderous assignment.  Throughout we see the Police following Sleven and another strange assassin, "GoodKat"  Bruce Willis, working with both underworld bosses<br /><br />Despite all the mob murder scenes, there is a springy charm throughout the movie, especially between Lindsey and Sleven.  Quick dialogue and creative camera work help the plots and twists which sometimes confound the viewer, but hang in there to get the satisfaction of the surprises.  A comic book dialogue between villains gives  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley a somewhat sly kick.  I enjoyed the scenes of crime bosses looking across at each other from the highest floors of adjacent skyscrapers.  Their self-enforced confinement of 20 years inside palatial offices emphasized the shackles of fear crime creates.<br /><br />Lucky Sleven was a nice surprise for an under-rated movie, a stylish, smart thriller.</p></body></html>

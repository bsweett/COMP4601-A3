I lean more toward movies like &quot;Misery&quot; than chop 'em up films like the Friday 13th series or the Halloween series.  This film does a lot of scaring without resorting to gaping neck wounds and gallons of blood.  And it has an interesting story line.  The director uses imagery, colors, and builds the tension in a way that draws the viewer in and fills you with dread for the lead character played by Naomi Watts.  This is a great horror film to add to your collection.  The dvd comes with extras that are interesting too.  Give this movie a try and you won't be disappointed.</p></body></html>

The movie also handles the change of seasons, to show the passing time, very well. It brings a good point about anger and about knowing all sides of the story. I agree that the truth is only every partially correct. This movie made me miss quite a few people I haven't spoken with in a while and wonder about lost ties and misunderstandings.</p></body></html>

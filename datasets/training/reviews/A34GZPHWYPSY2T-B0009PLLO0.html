One thing that strikes me is how hard it is to recall this film is only six years old. It seems like something out of the 1990s now.<br /><br />This film as historical novelization is, in a word, pure Stone. I love the depth and detail Stone powers into the audience here: close-ups of the Persians is a good example, as is his closing shots of classical images of Alexander including a statue of the Buddha (made first by Greeks and no doubt bearing Alexander's face). I love how Sir Anthony Hopkins (Ptolemy in old age, as the Pharaoh Ptolemy) refers to him in proper Greek, as "Megas Alexandros".<br /><br />Its two hour and forty-some-odd minutes running time is tiresome only in two areas: I do not like excessively operatic acting/music injected where it is not needed, and I do not like drawn-out, confusing battle scenes. Adding slo-mo as Stone loves to do so often does not help matters.<br /><br />What I do love is Colin Farrell as Alexander, silly Irish accent and all. (They even had Connor Paolo, as the young Alexander, beef up the Irish so he'd "fit" with Colin). Lordy, how he was mocked when this film was first released. Who the hell is Colin Farrell? What's with the Irish accent? Yet people mocked his bleached hair, so we did know him a little, after all. Well, my take on it is that it is Farrell's finest hour. He'd never reach this level of acting again.<br /><br />Actually, 'the Irish' gets even more annoying as Louisiana-born Jared Leto (as Alexander's boyfriend Hephaistion) puts on the blarney as well. I guess Stone figured to hell with it, let the Irish accent imply Macedonian heritage. And if I'm not in error, at least one Scots as well...let the Greeks talk British English. Only Val Kilmer as Alexander's father King Filipos [Phillip] managed to keep some reasonable distance from over-indulgence. I cannot fathom why Stone had the other actors speaking with silly accents...when they spoke at all.<br /><br />Anyway, with that off my chest, I have a couple of personal angles to approach with this film. While I love the unabashed showing of Alexander and Hephaistion's relationship as man-and-husband, it is to Stone's eternal shame that he did not have the courage to show it all properly. He did not shy away from Alexander's near-rape of his Persian wife "Roxane" (the eternally annoying Rosario Dawson). I might commend him on his beautiful display of the gorgeous Francisco Bosch as Alexander's male concubine Bagoas--yet the studios forced Stone to cut the lovemaking scenes between the men. It amounted to a half hour of footage.<br /><br />It was revolting to me the way Stone ultimately reduced the Greeks, Persians and Aryans to cardboard cut-out figures. Maybe he wanted us to see them the way Macedonians saw them, but I think it was pure laziness. The odd comparison Stone seems to make between Indians and monkeys made my blood boil. Maybe that's just me, but it looked fairly obvious.<br /><br />Christopher Plummer, in his cameo as Aristotle, was a delight and I loved seeing their map of the world as he taught young Alexander. I must also make a special mention of the great Elliot Cowan as young Ptolemy, because he is a believable young Anthony Hopkins--not easy! The last time that was tried was in THE HUMAN STAIN by young and beautiful Wentworth Miller in 2003--and it failed.<br /><br />Jared Leto deserves massive kudos. I know he's a weirdo and no one seems to like him anymore, but he's brash, he's beautiful and he can act his little heinie off here. The way he bores into Colin's eyes with his...love is in the air. Not just anyone can do that. I've heard Leto say he's "asexual" in real life and I know he's had fake gal pals and has a daughter. But that boy is GAY.<br /><br />Vangelis' score, though a bit too lush during battle scenes, is spot-on...I only wish there had been less of it and less volume. An operatic film like this, with its mad scene-chewing, is made worse only by equally operatic music. Ah well. It's film, not history class!<br /><br />I hope I will be forgiven for giving the names of the other actors a bit of a miss here. Go to the Internet Movie Database if you're that anxious to know. I don't see they deserve singling out since this film couldn't help the career of the brave and beautiful Francisco Bosch. There can be no denying it: either you'll despise every second of this film or you'll adore it in a general way. It's a lot better than the miserable TROY, I can tell you that.</p></body></html>

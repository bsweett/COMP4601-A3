<meta name="summary" content="THE CANNIBAL AND THE TOOTH FAIRY"></head><body><p>While none of the Lechter trilogy reaches the masterpiece proportions of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, RED DRAGON is a tense and involving thriller buoyed by the star performances of Anthony Hopkins, Edward Norton, Harvey Keitel, Ralph Fiennes, Emily Watson and Philip Seymour Hoffman.  As the movie opens, Norton captures the elusive Hopkins, not without suffering some physical and psychological repercussions.  Keitel convinces Norton to return to the FBI to help snare a monstrous killer who has been dubbed Tooth Fairy by Hoffman's tabloid publication.  This includes Norton's decision to seek the assistance of the equally vile Hopkins.  Moody and atmospheric, RED DRAGON is well paced by director Brett Ratner with an ominous score by the ingenious Danny Elfman, and a twist ending that might leave you squirming a little in your chair.</p></body></html>

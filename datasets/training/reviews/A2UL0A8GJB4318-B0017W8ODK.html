<meta name="summary" content=""Atonement" is an Absolute Stunner"></head><body><p>This is the kind of stunning, soul-shaking drama that was long thought to be near dead, if not extinct.  Far from the kind of gritty, hit-and-run indie flick that many superficially similar films have been, this baby wears its high production values and dramatic pedigree on its sleeve with jaw-dropping cinematography, piercing writing, impeccable directing and uniformly stellar acting.  Director Joe Wright and screenwriter Christopher Hampton have scored big time, resurrecting the kind of high caliber and emotionally earnest film that used to be made with regularity by major movie studios.  Where, I ask you, have been the Bravehearts, the Apollo 13's, the Forrest Gumps, the Shawshank Redemptions and the like, the movies that found the right blend of old-school Hollywood grandeur and gloss with artistic risk and thematic richness; the movies that reminded us why we loved movies in the first place?  They're a rare breed now-a-days (The Lord of the Rings a glorious exception) as it seems its either grandeur and gloss (The Pirates franchise) or artistic risk (No Country for Old Men).  But that's just another reason to love "Atonement:" it brings it all back, even if, ultimately, it's only briefly.<br /><br />The film opens in aristocratic England in 1935, the prolonged lull between the two great wars.  There, Robbie (James MacAvoy) tends the gardens of the upper crust Tallis family, while harboring secret longings for their eldest daughter Cecelia (Keira Knightley).  All the while, the youngest daughter Briony (Saoirse Ronan) quietly pines for Robbie, jealous of the attention he seems to pay to her older sister.  Her only outlet for her newly adolescent uncertainty is her unusually fertile imagination that crafts stories of daring and desperation.  Secrets and false perceptions lead to both Robbie and Cecelia to realize their mutual feelings and their undoing as Robbie is wrongfully accused of a horrible crime and Cecelia becomes estranged from her family.  To give away too much would be to spoil the raw emotional depth charges that sneak up, suffice it only to say that Briony's gifted mind betrays her.<br /><br />The film then jumps to 1940, with the British on their heels and retreating from France and the rampaging Nazi war machine (the audacious, breath-taking tracking shot of the British high-tailing it out of Dunkirk captures the ungodly cost and waste of war).  Robbie has been drafted into the Army and Cecelia and Briony have volunteered for the nursing corps.  But Briony is the outcast for inadvertently causing such pain for her older sister and the love of her life.  The one meeting between Cecelia and Robbie in a London coffee house before Robbie was to be shipped off to France speaks to true love, but also to enormous regret and chances lost. .  Theirs is a sincere romance tragically done in by forces beyond their control.  Knightley and MacAvoy may be young, but their acting chops are immense and far beyond their years.<br /><br />And that goes double for Ramona Garai, who portrays the teenaged Briony.  Her name is unknown for sure, but nonetheless she turns in the finest performance of the film.  In a movie whose major themes include regret and chances lost, she personifies the most potent: the perhaps futile quest for forgiveness for past transgressions, compounded, for Briony, by powerful feelings of shame that begat the cowardice to set things right and the knowledge that all the horrors that befall Robbie and Cecelia can be traced back to her wrongdoings.  It's Briony that needs to atone, and when she finally lays herself at the mercy of Cecelia and Robbie for forgiveness, Garai cuts to the bone.  Her eyes desperately, pleadingly search for that which she knows she will never deserve and it rips your heart out.  Later in life she will use her uncanny abilities for storytelling to vicariously atone for her sins, but it may never be enough.  Would it ever be enough for anyone?  Ponder that question, but do more.  See this stunner of a movie and be reminded of why and how movies can be powerful and entertaining simultaneously.</p></body></html>

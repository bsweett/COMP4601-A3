<meta name="summary" content="An actor's showcase populated by fantastic actors - a pleasure"></head><body><p>John Madden and Gwyneth Paltrow first collaborated on "Shakespeare in Love," one of the most intelligent, lush romantic comedies of all time.  They reunite to make a completely different kind of magic in "Proof," a film adaptation of a wildly popular play in which Paltrow also played the lead.<br /><br />"Proof" is steeped in the culture of mathematic academia, where words like "proof" are used with hallowed reverence, and the leading figures are considered to be gods by the "mere" professors and grad students.  Paltrow plays Katherine, younger daughter to a mathematical genius (Anthony Hopkins), who "revolutionized the field twice before he turned 26."  But Dad recently died after a long mental illness, and Katherine put her own academic life on hold to care for her dottering old man as they rattle around their big Chicago house together.  Katherine insists that Dad has some lucid times where he was working again, working on something great . . . could it be found in the hundreds of notebooks Dad left behind in his study?<br /><br />Grad student Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal) is plowing through the books as fast as he can.  (One has to suspend a little disbelief here, believing that any university has lookers like Paltrow and Gyllenhall in the same math department.)  Hal and Katherine also have a bit of a thing going, but both of them move with the caution bred from working too close for too long a time.  I've never really been a fan of Gyllenhaal before "Proof," but he gives a sincere, restrained performance that is just perfect.<br /><br />And then there's Claire (Hope Davis), Katherine's older sister, who has flown in from New York to help out.  Claire has clearly abandoned mathematics as a career and has moved on to more practical, lucrative pursuits (although her job is never explained).  Claire has the disadvantage of being a merely "talented" person born into a family of geniuses, and it's pretty clear that she's got plenty of her own issues.  Davis, giving yet another fine performance, conveys much of Claire's repressed frustration with brittle mannerisms and inflections, but neverteless she conveys a lot.<br /><br />But Paltrow is the true shining light here.  Far from the radiant beauty she plays in virtually every film, Paltrow here is haggard, worn thin by her years of caring for Dad and also the worry that she might be "like him" in both good ways and bad.  It's pretty clear that every character Plus, she's carrying a secret.  Either she has gone beyond her father's genius and discovered a new proof that had eluded the old guy, or she has stolen his work and tried to pass it off as her own.  Paltrow, one of the sunniest of actresses, here comes of as believable as a soul in torment.<br /><br />This is a "little film," clocking in at 90 minutes and with a tightly focused plot and cast.  That doesn't mean that it isn't excellent.  Along with "Wonder Boys" and "The Squid and the Whale," "Proof" stands firmly in the short line of recent fantastic movies about academics and academia.

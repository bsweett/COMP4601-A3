I watched it because it won an Oscar for something, I don't even know what.  My guess would be for Best Writing.  Anyway, I wasn't expecting anything all that much but I was very impressed on how the movie kept coming at me with more and more to offer.<br /><br />The story begins with a look at what appears to be a rather inept individual.  It's a lot of little things (along with an apparent hangover) that gives us this impression.  That's one of the keys to "Sideways"; the many subtle little things that enhance the movie.<br /><br />We come to understand that the man is picking up a former college roommate for a two-some bachelor party weekend in the California wine district.  The ex-roommate has a personality; our main character seems to lack anything of the sort.<br /><br />They arrive at their motel and start checking out the scene and we gradually get to know more and more about these guys.  The ex-roommate is out to have fun; the other has planned how they will have fun.  One is spontaneous and the other is calculated and that is another key to "Sideways"; the way these two play off each other.<br /><br />There's a lot of funny things that take place in the movie.  I would categorize "Sideways" as a comedy.  However, the part that impressed me the most was the romantic aspect of the movie.  I was really touched by the relationship that developed with our bumbling hero.  It was the part that stayed with me the longest.<br /><br />So many laughs and a bit of anguish led me to conclude that Hollywood can still do it.  "Sideways" is my idea of a complete movie.</p></body></html>

It was the first film since "It Happened One Night" (1934) to win all five of the top Academy Awards, for best picture, actor (Nicholson), actress (Louise Fletcher), director (Milos Forman) and screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman).Roger Ebert<br /><br />The film, 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' is based on Ken Kesey's 1962 best-selling novel, "contained the prophetic essence of the whole Vietnam period of revolutionary politics going psychedelic", as stated by Pauline Kael.<br /><br />The movie's portrays a simple approach.  Mcmurphy reminds me of my best friend, a free spirit in a closed system. The free spirit in this case is Jack Nicholson. Nicholson's performance is one of the high points in his career. Jack is a beloved star, an actor who is male.  He gets away with things because he knows how to.<br /><br />Nurse Ratched, Louise Fletcher, plays an inflexible woman and nurse. She must be in control of everything and everybody.<br /><br />"The film is known as an anti-establishment parable, but achieves its success by deliberately choosing to use the mental patients as comic caricatures. This decision leads to the fishing trip, which is at once the most popular, and the most false, scene in the movie. It is McMurphy's great joyous thumb in the eye to Ratched and her kind, but the energy of the sequence cannot disguise the unease and confusion of men who, in many cases, have no idea where they are, or why." Pauline Kael<br /><br />Through-out the film I had two recurring thoughts. What is really going on in McMurphy's mind, and how much different and how much alike this mental institution is than the one where I received my mental health nursing education. In my estimation the film revolves around what McMurphy is thinking and then, how he acts out on those thoughts. The amazing reality is that the treatment works for McMurphy, who'd a thunk it? One of the last scenes where McMurphy is lying on the floor, thinking. Has he given up?  I felt a  great deal of ambivalence about him, because I did not know whether to laugh or cry.  The antagonism between Nurse Ratched and McMurphy is pa;pable. She is straight-laced, and he is a free spirit.<br /><br />Highly, Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-08-07<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790734079">One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800124693">As Good As It Gets</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304712936">Amadeus</a></p></body></html>

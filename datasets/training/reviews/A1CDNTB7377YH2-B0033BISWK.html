<meta name="summary" content="A Little Boring a the beginning but the second half is excellent!"></head><body><p>The movie started off slow and directed like it was a documentary.  A mothership of aliens comes to Earth and stays hovered over  South Africa.  A military orginazation (NMU) sends a team of helicopters and moves the aliens to live in District 9, a hovel fillled area.  The aliens are called "prawns" and like to eat catfood.  The aliens also bring very advanced weapons that NMU is very interested in.  Unfortunately only the aliens can fire them because the weapons have sensors that only work with prawn DNA.<br /><br />The NMU decides that the aliens are to be relocated to another area a few miles away.  They send a team headed by one guy who seems like a "Monty Python" comedian.  He makes the aliens sign eviction notices.  I never could understand his name because most of the movie is spoken with very heavy South African accents and it was difficult to understand a lot that is said in the film.<br /><br />The spokesman discovers a viles of liquid that he tries tasting and it makes him sick.  He takes the liquid with him and then the liquid starts to change his body.  The changes make NMU very interested because his metamorphasis makes him able to use the alien weapons.  He goes on the run from the NMU and he has to stay alive while they are chasing him and also gets involved with some very bad Nigerian mafia.<br /><br />From this point the movie changes away from the documentary format and is very exciting and has a lot of tense moments.  The difficulty in understanding the accents does not matter and the action is excellent.  There are also some poigniant moments as he befriends one of the "scientist" prawns and the two team up to help him and also help the scientist prawn get back to the mother ship.<br /><br />I almost gave up on this movie but it turned out to be very good.  The special effects are similar to the Robocop movies but the great action and tense moments make up for the older effects.</p></body></html>

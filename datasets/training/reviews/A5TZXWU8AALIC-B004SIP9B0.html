Actual news footage and interviews with Diana only make it seem more real, as well as the characterizations of everyone on the screen.<br /><br />Some come off worse, others better.  I don't know.  Whatever the reality of what took place was, this is a very well-crafted, very compelling story.  I've always loved Helen Mirren.  She was a total Shakespeare babe in the 1970s (I saw some recent paparazzi shots of her in a bikini and she's still got it!), she's been great in everything I've seen her, and I'm thrilled she won the Oscar for THE QUEEN.<br /><br />One last note: as bad as the Royals come off in some scenes, especially Prince Philip railing about Diana and outraged that "homosexuals will be singing in Westminster" (Elton John's #1 song), I wondered if the British press was getting a bit of a pass: whenever I saw online papers from England, they were aghast and appalled at Diana's activities right up until she died (chased by the press, no less).  Diana found ways of using the press herself--sunbathing in bikinis whenever Charles accompanied Camilla Parker-Bowles out on the town--but I thought they were terrible to her otherwise.</p></body></html>

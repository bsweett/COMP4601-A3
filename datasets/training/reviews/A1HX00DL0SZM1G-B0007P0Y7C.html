<meta name="summary" content="One for Jennifer Garner and ALIAS fans"></head><body><p>I was sitting with a female friend of mine looking over a selection of DVDs to check out and we came across the latest martial arts superhero flick "ELEKTRA." Turning to me and pointing at the cover shot of Jennifer Garner she said to me "Now, I'm not into girls - but she is HOT!"<br />And that is a major draw for this movie - that and the impressive action scenes in which Garner puts her ALIAS tv show fighting chops to practice once more in a heart pounding series of set pieces.<br />But the main attraction (acknowledged reluctantly by Garner herself in pre-release publicity) is Garners super-sexy physique, nicely accented by the skin-tight red outfit she wears in the movie.<br />Serious and thought-provoking drama this is not - but to its credit it doesn't pretend to be. Sure there is character angst on the part of Elektra dealing with the death of her mother and the inner turmoil over being assigned to kill a young girl and her father. There is a lesbian subtext most visibly illustrated by the main female villainess giving Elektra (quite literally) the kiss of death and some character struggles on the part of the father and daughter. But for the most part the entire cast realize that this is pure popcorn fodder and act accordingly.<br />The plot (for what it is) revolves around the title character. An assassin for hire, she is a seemingly ghost-like figure who can evade high-tech security systems to get to her prey. Then while waiting for her next assignment she befriends a precocious young girl Abby (Kirsten Prout) and her protective father (played by Goran Visnjic). Eventually the orders arrive - the targets are the two. Feeling a connection with the young girl Elektra decides to protect them and the race is on as she attempts to keep one step ahead of the mystical criminal organization known only as The Hand.<br />Not surprisingly the actor who impressed me the most is the venerable Terence Stamp who plays Elektra's mentor Stick, also turning in a wonderful performance is the young Prout, who steals almost every scene in which she appears.<br />Directed by Rob Bowman, who proved he could direct action well in the excellent modern-day dragon picture REIGN OF FIRE, this movie moves along at a fair clip and does not outstay its welcome. Its not high drama or a romantic comedy - it's a no nonsense action flick that will appeal to ALIAS fans and most alpha-males who appreciate suspenseful, tension filled action scenes and shots of Garner in navel-revealing outfits.<br />The DVD includes three deleted scenes that  were "deleted" for good reason, a rather EPK fluff making-of documentary that includes both interviews with Bowman and Garner, a piece on Garner's time at the Comic Convention a rather nifty editing-room feature and the trailer. Hopefully one day when this movie has passed into cult-favorite status (as it is bound to become) they will get Bowman and Garner together for an audio commentary.<br />Until that day, sit back and enjoy some straightforward, good natured Jennifer Garner fun.<br /><br />Blu-ray update:<br />The video quality of the high definition Blu-ray is quite good and not surprisingly easily bests its standard def DVD counterpart, even if its blacks are little too dark at times. The Elektra costume is a nice cherry red while the foliage is a rich green, and the detail is extremely textured. The audio presentation on the Blu-ray is also simply excellent, with a rocking DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround track that will put your sound system to the test. There are a number of cross-channel effects and the LFE channel positively throbs with energy. All around, an extremely effective audio presentation that is definitely better than its DVD counterpart.<br />The supplements are headlined by "Reign of Fire" director Rob Bowman and an interestingly making of documentary that is significantly longer than the film it covers. In two parts, the "Relentless: Making of Elektra" clocks in at 2 hours 20 minutes. But, there's more, we are also treated to a 52 minute "Elektra: Incarnations" documentary that examines Elektra in the comic books. There's also a 15-minute "Elektra in Greek Mythology" which details, variations of the Elektra story in mythology. Rounding out the supplements is over 13 minutes of alternate or extended scenes, 5 minutes of deleted scenes, 2 trailers and a 2-minute + multi-angle feature of the fight scene at the well.<br />So, the verdict. If you are an Elektra fan, or a fan of Jennifer Garner at her sexiest, this Blu-ray as a purchase is a no brainer. The movie itself is popcorn fun, if terribly written, and the supplements are probably the most extensive you are likely to ever see. If the price point is right you should add this Blu-ray to your collection.</p></body></html>

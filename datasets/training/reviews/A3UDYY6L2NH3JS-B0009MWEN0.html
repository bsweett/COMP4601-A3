The various ? animals ?, in that case bugs, are very well animated and very realistic. If you don't like bugs, you will get a real thrill out of it. In fact they are even funny in a way. Then the film itself is a series of borrowed elements without any deep meaning at all. You will recognize some elements from Platoon, Aliens, Star Wars, even Star Trek, and many other films. But it is very representative of a ? man-centered ? approach of the universe : aliens are necessarily hostile and they have to be destroyed. But this film tries to be a little bit more intelligent than many other militaristic films : you have to understand their intelligence to defeat them. One step further and you may come to the idea of looking for a political solution that would lead to coexistence. This film is also a good illustration of the vanity of such an approach. In a war of that type there are not one head and slaves. This is a caricature and it may lead to catastrophes. When you get into a war with a whole people, race, species, etc, this group that sees you as the enemy, and that you see as the enemy, will be moved by their survival instinct which will lead them to a high level of autonomy and creativity. You can capture or kill the leader, or even the main leaders, that will not stop the war because it is a survival war, and everyone will be under pressure to do something for the survival of the culture, the country, the regime, the religion, you name it you have it. What do you think moved the French during World War II to resists against the Germans, to the point of liberating Paris and most of the big cities ? Many reasons but with one at the core of them all : it was the only way to prevent the anihilation of the nation, to guarantee the survival of the nation. <p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

Both Li and Yu are warriors, veterans of a life of battle against China's organized underworld which has both scarred them and yet turned them into the master warriors (restless and regretful) that they are recognized for.  The gift of the sword, and Yu's bringing it to Peking, are symbolic acts in both Yu and Li's lives, turnposts at which they might intersect free of their destinies and finally realize their mutual affections.  When the sword, called "The Green Destiny" is stolen by a masked warrior who can leap tall pagodas in a single bound, plans are put aside and the hunt is on, not so much to reclaim the sword, but to repay a debt to the evil Jade Fox, a warrior who betrayed and murdered Li's teacher.  <p>Director Ang Lee supposedly crafted this elaborate art-house film as a high-minded tribute to the martial-arts epics of his youth, in which single warriors fight off an army of lesser fighters, while more-equal-matched bouts have the fighters hurtling through the air, as if rocketed from the planet Krypton.  But "Tiger" goes further, delving into the regret of its characters.  Besides Lee, we have Yu-Jen, the elfin faced girl who's prosepctive marriage to a highly-placed noble makes her pine for the life of a brigand, one she "claims" to know only from books, and Lo, a desert brigand with whom she has fallen in love.  Then there is the evil Jade Fox herself who puts in an appearance.  Unfortunately, Lee doesn't devote enough time to any of these compelling characters, though he does work them up excellently.  The "Green Destiny" itself is too quickly relegated to an object that doesn't quite hold our attention (Like that suitcase in "Pulp Fiction", it's quickly overshadowed by the characters that kill for it), and the mysterious thief and her awesome fighting skills take center stage.  A subplot linking the seemingly innocent Jen with the wildly exotic Lo is dropped in midway and threatens to steal the movie away, but its more than made up with by the depth brought to Lo and Jen's characters which seemed to have amassed the regret that Jade Fox, Yu and Li have taken their lives to collect.  A great film.</p></body></html>

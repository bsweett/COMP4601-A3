<meta name="summary" content="Well done suspense drama"></head><body><p>Jimmy Stewart is a photojournalist confined to a wheelchair in his apartment with a broken leg. He spends most of his time gazing out the window at his neighbors, until one day he sees something that looks like a murder taking place. Grace Kelly plays his lover; she wants to marry him, but he thinks her pampered life makes her unsuitable for the rough life he leads. She, of course, leads the way in the dangerous murder probe they set out upon. It's to Hitchcock's credit that he had Kelly believe Stewart's story almost from the start, so we don't have to endure his trying to convince her it's true. (It also allows the picture to focus on its single point: she's no mamby-pamby and can do anything Stewart can.) The early going is rather slow - only the snappy dialogue saves it, though the suspense builds nicely near the end. Thelma Ritter is very good as Stewart's nurse - she has most of the wisecracking lines. The camera never leaves the apartment or the courtyard: Hitchcock loved the single setting idea during this time (see also ROPE AND LIFEBOAT). Definitely worth a watch.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A thriller that had me in its grip the whole way through"></head><body><p>I hate to sound like a PTA lady or something, but you just cannot know certain emotions until you have experienced your own children.  Lest you scoff, I used to roll my eyes when people would wax sentimental about their kids.  But this really is a different ball game my friends, and until you have felt that peculiar pull in your chest as the chubby hand of your toddler grips your index finger to cross the street, you just won't get it.  For that same reason, (I believe) the movie The Forgotten won't be experienced the same way by childless people as it will by parents.<br /><br />The following is all information that was previously given away in the theatrical trailers:  Telly (Julianne Moore) has been grieving for her son Sam for 14 months now, following his death in a plane crash.  Imagine how she is simply unable to accept her therapist's sudden diagnosis one day that Sam was a figment of her imagination; in fact, her husband, friends, everybody in her life sincerely claims he never existed.  There are no pictures, no records of his birth, his life, or the crash. You will begin to wonder along with Telly if she isn't crazy, that is until she meets another parent of a child in that same crash whom she convinces to remember his daughter, using undeniable physical proof.  Obviously two strangers don't normally share in the same elaborate delusion, so some kind of conspiracy must be going on...but why, and how is it  *humanly* possible?<br /><br />Julianne Moore, who only gets more attractive with time, was the flawless choice for the lead in this film.  She so convincingly portrays a grieving mom who just can't let go that my throat was tight with sympathy throughout half the film.  Played by unknown Dominic West, the only other parent she locates is an alcoholic who is punishing himself for forgetting the most precious person in his life.  One of my favorite (and underutilized) actors, Gary Sinise, was a natural for Telly's therapist, although his role was somewhat minimized.  I have noticed that very few critics have been able to fault any of the leads in The Forgotten despite what other misgivings they may have.<br /><br />And what misgivings are we talking about exactly?  More or less, they were disappointed that there was a Sci Fi explanation for the events of Sam's disappearance.  It would seem that naysayers would have preferred find out that the whole thing was a delusion or a mundane government conspiracy. Given the info that we all got from the trailer (see above), those really weren't logical options, now were they?  You may now picture me shaking my head sadly as I confront the critical ones with a Tsk Tsk, and "Weren't you paying attention?"<br /><br />The secondary strength of The Forgotten was its themes.  Explored here are the strength of the parent/child bond, questions on the relativity of reality, and the place of humankind in the greater scheme of things.  Not easy material to cram into less than two hours, but handled nicely in this story.  Applause also goes out to the art direction and sound editing.  The depth of emotional response was underscored deftly by DTS.  This is one to see with the full advantage of a loaded sound system.  Without giving too much away, trust me:  you will appreciate those moments of pure physical thrill that a good sound format can highlight so effectively.<br /><br />Perhaps this film would not have affected me so viscerally if I had not been a parent.  Perhaps therefore non-parents cannot be blamed for getting less out of it, as much of its effectiveness relies on empathy with Telly and Ash.  Still, there are many other worthwhile reasons to see The Forgotten, and I humbly hope that I have just explained why.  Recommended.<br /><br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="what a magical, wonderous joyride"></head><body><p>you gotta be a goon times 25 if you didnt immediately fall in love with Goonies, at any age. But how wonderful it was for those of us in the pre teen years, who saw this when it first came out. How magical the ride was.<br /><br />I mean Speilberg, Donner and Chris Columbus. I mean the cream of the incessant crop.<br /><br />"Goonies" is quintessential Speilberg. When a film, not in the era of CGI, and computer animated everything, can just grip you with an amazing score, a slew of talented kids, and a storyline that is gripping, flowing and totally fun, you feel so great about yourself over and over again. I can be down in the dumps to the extreme, and throw Goonies in, and it takes my through a rough day with smiles and enticing childlike splendor.<br /><br />How many of us wanted to be part of that group? How many of us dreamt, in those wee hours, before slept crept in, when we saw Goonies for the first time, or the 90th time, and dreamt such amazing things: to find hidden treasure, to climb down wells and discover hidden caves, to dig through canals and taverns in our backyards and find our own One Eyed Willie, eye mattey, ehhhhhh, yes, the magic of the Gonnies so transformed my youth and brought me to that magical place of make believe, which only the brilliance of Speilberg can do producing. Pirates of the Carribean doesn't touch Goonies for sentimentality or the like.<br /><br />I will never forget seeing this when I was 9 or 10 or so, and getting all red with my mother when they kiss in the dark. I was learning about life then, and Goonies certainly helped me realize the wonderous things I was to look forward to.<br /><br />Not to mention that the character actress Anne Ramsey is impeccably sinister and perfect in her role as Mom Fratelli.<br /><br />One of my favorite films in the world as a child, and totally up there even by today's standards.<br /><br />Chunk, Baby Ruth, Rocky Road, and the hilarious performance by Corey Feldman.<br /><br />Thank you.</p></body></html>

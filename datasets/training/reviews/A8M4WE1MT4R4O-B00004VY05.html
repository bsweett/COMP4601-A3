<meta name="summary" content="Lost in Space"></head><body><p>This movie threw me for a loop!  As i was watching the first hour of it i came so close to actually fast forwarding it.  I found the plot and the entire story hard to follow at times unless you were completely paying  attention 100% of the time.  Some of the characters were a tad bit  annoying, especially the character played by Milla Jovovich.  She reminded  me of a space aged &quot;Nell&quot; (the jodi foster character).  Her  ramblings were boderline intolerable at times, making it nauseating to  watch.  The scene where she is babeling to Bruce Willis, carrying on in  some unintelligable jargon was also hard to stomach.  &quot;Boom  boom&quot;, she came crashing through the roof of his cab, then Bruce tried  to communicate with her using her dialect and the whole thing just became  ridiculous to watch.  (Almost as ridiculous and tacky as the orange tank  top he wore throughout the film). Gary Oldman plays a swarthy &quot;bad-guy  type character&quot; wanting to gets his hands on the stones!  His  character too, is annoying and you find yourself asking, &quot;does that  plastic thing really need to be on the side of his head?&quot;<p>What saved  this movie for me was the performance by Chris Tucker and the cool opera  solo by the blue creature. As soon as she appeared on screen, emenating a  blue glow and belting out a haunting operatic falsetto, my outlook began to  change on this seemingly forgettable film.  To make matters more strange,  Chris Tucker's character began to come to life as well.  He added comic  relief to the fullest extent.  I found myself barking out in fits of  laughter over his psychotic performance.  The movie quickened up it's  sluggish pace towards the end, and bam!  everything started to fall into  place in lightning speed.  Even Gary Oldman's character somehow became more  interesting to watch.<p>So The Fifth Element (saved by the grace of Chris  Tucker) was not a complete loss.  With an unforgetable classic scene by  that opera singin' blue thing, it's worth owning for that alone. I just  wish they could re-do the first half of the film!</p></body></html>

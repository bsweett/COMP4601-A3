On his way to winning it all, he ignores the advice of his pit crew and blows his tires near the finish line. A photo-finish shows a 3-way tie and sets the stage for the big race. A wrong turn on his way to California lands him in hot water at Radiator Springs. Sentenced to fix the road he destroyed in this old and dilapidated town something happens. The self-centered racing stud starts to care about something more than himself.<br /><br />This a great movie for kids and adults. The story is wonderful as are the lessons to be learned. I am extremely partial to this film because it was my little boy's 1st favorite movie! Disney/Pixar do it again!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: DAZZLING! The details on Blu-Ray are outageous. The picture is tremendous, the reflections and details on the cars are amazing! The sound wasn't what I expected but was fine. All the special features are carried over to HD and their are additional Blu-Ray features added! FINAL VERDICT: DON'T LOSE THIS RACE! UPGRADE, ABSOLUTELY! BUY IT!</p></body></html>

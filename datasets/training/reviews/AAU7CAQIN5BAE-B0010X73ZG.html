<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely remarkable"></head><body><p>I usually reserve five stars for stuff like Schindler's List, Sound of Music, Almost Famous, Fear and Loathing, etc...<br /><br />What surprised me the most:  1. a stephen king adaptation usually always gets butchered, and/or is horrifyingly bad. 2. I can't believe Dimension Films put out something that was actually stunning.<br /><br />Like others have said, the ending, 'UNREAL' Absolutely unreal...I just love the way the movie was filmed almost documentary style, ya know, like it doesn't look like it was done on 35mm, and just the way the film, as I am sure others have stated more fluently than I, transcends the emotional and psychological rollercoaster of something supernatural like this, rather than from just a horror, gore, B Movie, Wes Craven/John Carpenter standpoint.<br /><br />Really,really, really well done.</p></body></html>

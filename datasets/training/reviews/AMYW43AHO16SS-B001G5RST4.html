I wish I could say the same about the script.  There are some laughs in spots and there are dead spots.  It tries to be too funny for it's own good and tries too much to be like Shrek.  Some laughs adults will enjoy some lines and some scriptlines will go over Children's heads.  But kids will enjoy this cute film.  Marginal recommendation.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of my horror classics"></head><body><p>Hellraiser is a film that I recall seeing when I was seven years old. Clive Barker was a rising talent in Hollywood and made a great first film. Ashley Laurence( who early in her career looked like a low budget Heather Landekamp) gives a good performance as the films' heroine and Andrew Robinson is always good. The villains played by Sean Chapman and Claire Higgins give a shocking performance as the brother and wife of Robinson's charcter who had a tryst back in the day . But ther eal star of the film is Doug Bradley as Pinhead who used to haunt my dreams as a child and if I ever see the box I'll run.</p></body></html>

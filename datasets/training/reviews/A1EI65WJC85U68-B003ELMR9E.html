<meta name="summary" content="INSOMNIA is a long way from being a snoozer"></head><body><p>Hollywood seems to have a love affair with remakes. A few years back it was hip to remake French films, then it was film versions of old TV shows, and every year there seems to be a "Sequelitis" epidemic in multiplexes worldwide. But INSOMNIA offers a Hollywood rarity: This is a remake of a NORWEGIAN movie.<br />While my opening comments don't offer much hope for the film, INSOMNIA is actually a great movie once you get into it. Starring Oscar winners Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank, executive produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney and directed by Christopher Nolan director of the vastly overrated MEMENTO, INSOMNIA is a compelling mystery thriller.<br />When cop Will Dormer (Pacino) witnesses the murder of his partner, the prime suspect is mystery writer Walter Finch (Williams). But while Finch appears accommodating to the police, chronic insomniac Dormer finds himself receiving taunting calls from Finch in the middle of the night. Dormer's investigation leads him to a remote Alaskan town which never sees nightfall during the spring/summer seasons where he is partnered with local cop Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank). But with the combination of the continued threats from his unseen nemesis and the stress of the investigation, Dormer's sleeping disorder is wearing him down and disorientating him, making him an easier target.<br />Like MEMENTO, INSOMNIA is full of twists and is beautifully photographed. But thankfully unlike it, INSOMNIA has a plot that makes sense and keeps the viewer glued to the screen; but it is the strong characterisations by Pacino and Williams that make their cat-and-mouse game utterly compelling. I haven't seen the Norwegian version, but as far as remakes go its probably a pretty safe bet that INSOMNIA is in the upper ranks.</p></body></html>

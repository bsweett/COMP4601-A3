<meta name="summary" content="I liked it.........."></head><body><p>Sandra Bullock plays Linda Hanson a mother of two young girls and wife to a husband who is living in his own little world, not paying much attention to his wife or her needs.<br />Linda awakes to find that her husband has been killed in a roadside car accident and is devastated----BUT-----the next day she awakes to her husband being there by her side and not dead.  The next day, dead again, the next day alive again.<br />She finally goes on a psychological hunting spree to figure out why this phenomenum is going on, and without giving away the premise of the movie, which to me is right in your face, I will just write----keep things close to your heart and love deeply, for one day it may all be gone and regret and sorrow will overbound.....</p></body></html>

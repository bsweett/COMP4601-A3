<meta name="summary" content="Iron Man 2 [Blu-ray]"></head><body><p>With the world now aware of his dual life as the armored superhero Iron Man, billionaire inventor Tony Stark faces pressure from the government, the press, and the public to share his technology with the military. Unwilling to let go of his invention, Stark, along with Pepper Potts and James "Rhodey" Rhodes at his side, must forge new alliances and confront powerful enemies.<br /><br />Downey is actually better than ever in this sequel.  Iron Man 2 knows how to jump the hurdles and have you wanting more. Mickey Rourke is outrageous as a russian killing machine. Iron Man 2 isn't content with one bad guy, there's lots more. Iron Man 2 is very entertaining, But it's the talented Downey who makes Iron Man 2 something to remember.</p></body></html>

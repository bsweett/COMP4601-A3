<meta name="summary" content="Atonement (Full Screen Edition)"></head><body><p>Briony Tallis, 13 years old and an aspiring writer, sees her older sister Cecilia and Robbie Turner at the fountain in front of the family estate she misinterprets what is happening thus setting into motion a series of misunderstandings and a childish pique that will have lasting repercussions for all of them. Robbie is the son of a family servant toward whom the family has always been kind. They paid for his time at Cambridge and now he plans on going to medical school. After the fountain incident, Briony reads a letter intended for Cecilia and concludes that Robbie is a deviant. When her cousin Lola is raped, she tells the police that it was Robbie she saw committing the deed when in fact it was a visitor to the estate. The storyline of Atonement is where this movie holds most of its impact. From horses being shot to a man hanging from a ferris wheel, the sequence is shown in all its glory. It really is a powerful moment, and probably the one scene that got me almost to tears, purely because of the singing in the background, it is shocking just how amazing this sequence truly is. "Atonement" is a perfect movie, superb performances, beautiful direction, a script and storyline that's great. A great interpretation of a wonderful novel.</p></body></html>

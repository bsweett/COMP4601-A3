Romero allows a remake of Dawn last year that takes the zombies to a new level: they run, they seem a little smarter, and (yuck) they can give birth. Then this year, in Land, the zombies seem to have forgotten how to run but now they are even smarter than in the Dawn remake. Oh well. Land was still good fun.<br /><br />I thought that the 1990 remake of Night of the Living Dead was terrific, as was last year's Dawn of the Dead remake. Land was fun, but it was a step away from the realistic situations predominant in the more recent versions of Night Of and Dawn. (Wait a minute...realistic situations...the walking dead...???)<br /><br />Anyway, Land of the Dead is certainly not a continuation of last year's Dawn. It's George Romero's take on what happens to some far-fetched Dennis Hopper owned "city" well after the zombies have taken over the rest of the world. John Leguizamo and Simon Baker are two mercenaries that run a gang of zombie killers with access to an awesome battle machine and a ton of firepower (these two guys and their gangs running the "military" of the city as opposed to the city police/military running it themselves make you need to go even further for that extra grain of salt).<br /><br />A "smart" zombie leads an angry mob of other zombies to Dennis' city, John Leguizamo turns on Dennis and Simon finds some good guys to try to make it all right in a world gone bad.<br /><br />I was entertained and would not suggest anyone interested in the genre pass on Land of the Dead. And beware...what George seemed to lack in a more believable plot line he made up for in going for the gross out.</p></body></html>

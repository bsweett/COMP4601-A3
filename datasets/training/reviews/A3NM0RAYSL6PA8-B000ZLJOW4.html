<meta name="summary" content="Interesting movie--interesting characters"></head><body><p>From reviews I'd read, I expected to be blown away by Ghost World--much the way I'd been blown away by American Beauty and Lost in Translation.  I wasn't.  It's a good movie, mind you.  Interesting characters who feel very genuine albeit somewhat one dimensional, and an odd tangle relationships.  It also very effectively captures the alienation of smart teens growing up in a world that seems populated by zombies of one kind or another.  So, it's very much worthwhile watching it--maybe more than once.  (I can't help but think of Thora Birch as a smart version of Kelly Osbourne from her dress and mannerisms in this movie.  But that's neither here nor there.)<p>So what's wrong with it?  What keeps it from being great?  In part, it's the almost relentlessly brooding tone that keeps the characters from being fully realized human beings.  Maybe, just maybe, there are people as unreliable, aimless, and alienated all the time--just like Thora Birch's character.  But do we really need a movie about someone who is so malignantly morose?  And no one else in the movie really picks up the slack, showing that intelligent people can be sharp and effective, as well as cynical.  Without that counterpoint, the story has a mushy center, and starts to get--well--a little boring.</p></body></html>

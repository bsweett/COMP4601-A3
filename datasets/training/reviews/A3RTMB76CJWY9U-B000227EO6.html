<meta name="summary" content="Personally? I liked her better when she was just "The Bride.""></head><body><p>Matt Putnam, in his Spotlight Review, writes:<br /><br />"If you're a fan of volume 1 then you should be more then satisfied."<br /><br />Apparently, most people here agree with him... but, I don't.<br /><br />Kill Bill Vol. 2 is very different than Kill Bill Vol. 1.<br /><br />Vol 2, continuing the Bride's quest for revenge, is a much tamer, subdued and introspective film than the gaudy comic richness of Vol 1. The fight sequences are smaller and more "realistic" (though they still aren't realistic by any means) than in the first film; this movie is more about fleshing out the characters and their motivations and emotions. The Bride even gets a name.<br /><br />And, as they say, "your mileage may vary." Me? I preferred the styles in Volume 1. I liked the cheesy, over-the-top 70s homage, the siren-like announcements of fights (used once here, then discarded) and the anime sequence. There is one sequence in Vol 2. which I find very clever--the training with Kung Fu legend Pei Mei, which is straight out parody--but overall, Vol 2. is simply slower and longer than Vol 1.<br /><br />But, like I say: other people will really like this movie, and many will even prefer it to Vol 1. It all depends on your taste, going in.<br /><br />Despite my prefering the first part, I take comfort in the thought that these two movies kind of represent an artist's palette. Over the course of the two films, Tarantino has experimented and experimented in film genre and style, and I can only guess that these experiences will help him to develop his voice and grow in the future. In short, the kid's still learning, and I think that means that he's only going to get better, which is pretty incredible when you consider that he's already one of the best directors we have.<br /><br />It is very different than Vol. 1, and I personally wasn't completely satisfied, but still an intriguing film. Three stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Modern Day Twilight Zone"></head><body><p>If you were a fan of the Twilight Zone (you know, the old black & white TV series) you should love The Butterfly Effect. Basically this guy Evan (Ashton Kutcher) discovers that every time he reads from journals that he wrote as a young boy he is teleported back to the exact moment that he is reading about with just enough time to "do something different" that "Effectively" has a dramatic "Effect" on the way his (and his friends') life ultimately turns out. I was thoroughly entertained. This is no teeny-bopper-Ashton-Kutcher-fan movie. It is well-acted, thrilling and suspenseful.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Here is why you should never remake a great movie"></head><body><p>This exercise explains why you should never remake a film that was great, as was "Assault on Precinct 13" when it was made by John Carpenter in 1976. The star power on parade in this flick -- Gabrial Byrne, Ethan Hawke, Drea de Matteo, Maria Bello, Lawrence Fishburne and John Leguizamo -- cannot save this  from being little more than an overtly violent Xerox copy of the original with none of its panache or imagination.<br /><br />While Carpenter's original -- a remake of the Howard Hawks-John Wayne western "Rio Bravo" -- was bold, exciting and unpredictable with a plot that emphasized chaos, this film is unbold, sometimes exciting and goes too far to explain every little detail about why the gang is attacking the police station that is closing on New Year's eve. It not only does nothing the original didn't do better, it leaves nothing for the audience to figure out on their own.<br /><br />While Carpenter's original cast a bunch of no name actors with no budget and turned out a monster that became a national hit once it was circulated later in the decade on HBO, this movie never gets over being a tepid retread.<br /><br />What disturbed me most in this bad remake is the collective portrayal of the female roles. In the 1976 original, there was only one woman in the cast, a secretary in the police station. This one reprised that role, added a psychiatrist in a short dress, and a black female prisoner.<br /><br />While not bad in itself, what is unforgivable is these women were cast as the archetypal cliches of Hollywood films. Two of the women were extremely sexy and dressed in garb to accentuate their sexiness, while the black female was (of course) a streetwise prisoner declaring her innocence in rap rabble. Oh yes, she could hotwire a car too.<br /><br />Were the people that wrote, edited, produced and directed this film so unimaginative as to not take one risk with a female character? The answer is no and that is the endearing formula for this movie: remake the original with modern technique and take no risks to be different or better.<br /><br />A couple of the actors distinguished themselves within the context of this unimaginative film. Fishburne was, as always, a commanding screen presence, Leguizamo added a dimension to a cliched prisoner role, and de Matteo showed she can become someone other than Adrianna from "The Sopranos" and the other TV characters she has portrayed.<br /><br />But these performances were not sufficient to deny comparison between this and the original, a comparison where this film inevitably suffers badly. Your only chance to truly enjoy this movie is to never have seen nor heard of the original. If that's you, then go for it. But after you're done with this, go out and buy the original from Amazon.com and find out what can be achieved with this idea.</p></body></html>

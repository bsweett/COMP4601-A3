<meta name="summary" content=""His enemies went blind from sheer awesomeness...""></head><body><p>This is a film with truly inventive three dimensional animation and a creative storyline that is full of life lessons for young and old. I was told that KUNG FU PANDA was "very Zen," and it is. It's also fun to watch. It's anthropomorphic animal cast is endearing.<br /><br />Po (voiced by Jack Black) is "a big, fat panda" from the Valley of Peace, who works in his Dad's noodle shop as a waiter. His Dad (voiced by James Hong) is a goose whose fondest wish is that his son follow him into the family business. Po's Dad is awaiting the glorious day when he can reveal to Po the secret ingredient in his Secret Ingredient Noodle Soup.<br /><br />Po, for his part, dreams of being a Kung Fu warrior, and idolizes the Furious Five, a group of highly trained warriors taught by Master Shifu, a Red Panda (voiced by Dustin Hoffman). Shifu's own Master, Oogway (voiced by Randall Duk Kim) is a wise old tortoise who warns Shifu that his renegade student Tai Lung (a Snow Leopard voiced by Ian McShane) will be returning to the Valley to exact vengeance against Shifu for having been passed over as the greatest warrior of all time, The Dragon Warrior. Oogway prophesies that the true Dragon Warrior will appear to defeat Tai Lung. Shifu, for his part, has none of the equipoise of Oogway. He is short-tempered and judgemental.<br /><br />The Furious Five represent each of the major styles of Kung Fu. Tigress (voiced by Angelina Jolie) is their leader. She is egotistical. Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Crane (David Cross) who round out the group, each have small roles.<br /><br />Comes the great day when Oogway is to name the Dragon Warrior, and the designate-presumptive, Tigress, is shocked to discover that Oogway picks the totally untrained, physically clumsy Po as The Dragon Warrior. The rest of the Furious Five are nonplussed. Shifu too, has great doubts about Oogway's choice. The group is rude to Po and mock him at every opportunity until Oogway commands Shifu to train Po. The secret to Po's training is contained in the mysterious Dragon Scroll, which only the Dragon Warrior may have, and which Tai Lung covets.<br /><br />The animated action sequences are complex and realistic, breaking new ground in animation. The film is very visually appealing and captures a sense of a stylized Classical China beautifully. It is the storyline that truly shines, though, as the characters learn not to judge one's skills, talent and abilities---whether ally or  opponent or oneself---by appearances alone.<br /><br />In the same vein as THE KARATE KID, KUNG FU PANDA is a great movie for everybody of any age.</p></body></html>

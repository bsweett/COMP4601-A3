<meta name="summary" content="A masterpiece"></head><body><p>Since this film was released ten years ago, it still garners acclaim the world over, and justifiably it should.  Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is a true feast for the senses, from the atmosphere to the state of the art stop motion animation, this film is pure joy from beginning to end.  The story revolves around Jack Skellington, the king of Halloweentown who soon tires of his day in, day out Halloween themed shenanigans.  When he stumbles upon Christmastown, he plans to bring his own version of Christmas to everyone by impersonating a kidnapped Santa Claus.  While the film is aimed at a young audience, teens and adults will eat up everything that is presented here.  And even though some of the film may be too macabre for it's own good towards young children, The Nightmare Before Christmas is still a rousing film that actually will satisfy the entire family.  This Special Edition DVD presents the film with a fantastic DTS track, and includes a number of extras including two short films from Tim Burton.</p></body></html>

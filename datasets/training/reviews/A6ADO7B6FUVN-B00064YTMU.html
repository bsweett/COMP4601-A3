<meta name="summary" content="Existentialism and Carpe Diem in Solid Thriller..."></head><body><p>Two men are about to cross paths unknowing of what consequences they will have upon each other.  Max (Jamie Foxx) is dreamer that has worked as a cab driver for 12 years while awaiting the moment when he has enough capital to invest in a Limousine company that will offer the ultimate ride for its passengers.  When fares begin to converse with Max he often brings up his vision of the Limo company, and one evening at the airport he meets a stunningly beautiful lawyer, Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith).  On their way to Annie's destination they begin to chat about music, her job, and his dreams, which eventually leads to Annie offering him her card as a token that she wants to see him again.<br /><br />Bewildered in his thoughts Max remains seated in the cab after Annie has left when a new fare asks if the cab is taken, which breaks the spell on him.  The passenger in due time reveals his name as Vincent (Tom Cruise) while he probes Max of who he is, and then he tells Max that he has five stops to make and he can make $600 if he stays with him.  Hesitant Max considers the offer, however, Vincent appears as a tough negotiator as he pushes the money into his hand while telling that these offers do not happen often.  Max takes the money and parks in the alley where he begins to eat his supper while thumbing a Mercedes brochure.  However, this is the peaceful moment before the storm that is about to enter Max's life and turn it upside down.<br /><br />Vincent has a cynical outlook on life that is heavily influenced by Darwinistic thinking and possibly Nietzsche as he believes that man has to seize the day, or the man might perish.  The moment of existence is now, not later, if one waits one misses an opportunity to make the most of the current situation.  This is what Vincent's life philosophy boils down to as he brings Max on an existential journey.  The two venture to a jazz club where Vincent and Max sit down and listen to the spontaneous jamming by the band on the stage.  Vincent wonders if Max can hear the sudden surprise that lays within the music, but Max is too preoccupied with his internal fear to give the music any thought.  At the end of the evening at the jazz club the cab driver and the passenger talk with Daniel, the owner and a musician, who recollects the moment when Miles Davis entered the club and how he missed his opportunity as a musician.<br /><br />When Max and Vincent are between destinations Max receives a message over the radio that his mother is anxiously wondering about his whereabouts, as she is hospitalized and he visits her every evening.  Slightly amused over the situation Vincent looks at his watch and says that they have time for a quick stop.  When they enter the hospital Vincent reminds Max that his mother carried him in her uterus for nine months, and he must bring her flowers for which Vincent pays.  When they arrive to the room where Max's mother rests she continuously criticizes him while speaking softly and kindly to Vincent, which appears to be very difficult for Max.  It is evident to Vincent that Max never attempts to take the step from dream to reality, as Max seems to be preoccupied by insecurities and fears of failure, which seems rooted in Max's relationship to his mother.<br /><br />In Seventh Seal (1957) Ingmar Bergman offers some insights to our existence as Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) plays a prolonged chess match with the Grim Reaper.  Collateral works in a similar manner as Seventh Seal.  Max is the guide to the destinations, as Block did in Seventh Seal, while Vincent is the person that follows much like the Grim Reaper.  Maybe it is far fetched to say that Collateral compares to the masterpiece Seventh Seal, however, the similarities are there in regards to existentialism.  The question is whether Max will learn anything from Vincent while visiting the five different destinations.<br /><br />Michael Mann's Collateral is a solid cinematic experience that depicts serious philosophy through an action packed thriller.  The cast's performances provide genuine feel for who characters are, maybe the scene when Max pretends to be Vincent as he talks to Felix (Javier Bardem) is a little over the top, but it turns out to be one of those cool scenes where no one can get hurt.  The long opening before Max meets Vincent displays Mann's cunningness in direction as this provides a strong foundation that develops strong characters, which is needed for this story.  However, Mann does not reach the same level with Collateral as he did with Heat (1995) and The Insider (1999), yet he touches something deeper with this film as he dwells on existentialism and carpe diem.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Different From The Previous Two, Disappointingly Different."></head><body><p>As usual, I'm here to look at the flaws mainly.<br /><br />1. Hannibal in this third installment is not how he usually is in previous installments. He is still smart and witty and quick to speak, but not poetic and the suspense in his tone is lacking or not there. You have to sort of watch the others and this back to back to see the difference. I just find his verbal scenes in this one a lot less satisfying, the Hannibal signature is starting to lack. It's hard to describe.<br /><br />2. The new main character, Edward Norton, is a great actor HOWEVER he does not fit this role nearly as well as his predecessors. He just doesn't have it. He's a fantastic actor in other movies, he just doesn't fit this role much in this one IMO. He doesn't look the part nor is he meant for it.<br /><br />3. The pace of the movie. I feel it is a bit quick and doesn't have the mystery feel behind it like it usually does. Hannibal usually assists with this area significantly, but his role feels rather lacking not to mention it differs from the usual. Basically, I'm missing the similar suspense and story build up. It doesn't interest me like the others.<br /><br />4. The scene with the reporter I believe? Slightly past the one hour mark of the movie and the scene with the killer (no this is not a spoiler....) This is where the acting goes to h*ll. Just watch it, the whole entire scene becomes a joke and I almost had to keep myself from laughing. Like the movie was sorta okay, then suddenly they threw in some goof balls....it almost became a comedy of some sorts. Just watch the whole scene from their encounter, just plain laughable directing and acting.<br /><br />5. !!WARNING POSSIBLE OPENING SCENE SPOILER ALERT!! I'll just admit straight out that the opening scene itself is flawed because in the prequels of this making, Hannibal is usually portrayed purposefully as someone almost invulnerable, impossibly witty and sly. Him getting killed the way he did in the beginning is a grave mistake, especially with such a lame and outright approach. He's the great Hannibal Lecter, getting stabbed with some arrows and shot during a lame charge is an insult....<br /><br />6. LMAO! I'm still watching this and they describe the villain as a very strong person that is possibly a body builder! Based on the weights that he lifted in the earlier parts of the movie, there is no way he is that darn strong. He is not exceptionally or extraordinarily strong or buff enough for him to set himself apart from many other people out there, especially enough to help narrow the search down to just him. He looks like an average man, not even muscly either!<br /><br />7. !!POSSIBLE VILLAIN'S WEAPON CHOICE SPOILER!!The villain's choice of weapon is one huge thing degrades the movie, how can you have a Hannibal related villain that runs around with a silencer gun....I mean come on! We want our villains to remain brutal, man eating, gore loving, hands on murderers! Not some little pansy with a gun, guns are for wimps. I do also take note that the villain in the first movie also slightly uses a gun, but he fits the other description so it's negligible.<br /><br />8. The ending was a bit confusing but basically there's a twist. I won't tell you the twist, but like other reviewers, I have to agree that it is indeed lame.<br /><br />9. !!POSSIBLE NEAR ENDING SPOILER ALERT!! Okay does anyone even know how the heck that blind woman got out of that ring of fire near the end? I mean COME ON!<br /><br />IN CONCLUSION:<br /><br />Anyone that gives or have given this movie a star rating of 4 or 5 is out of their mind. Take in mind that only 5 percent or less of the population knows what is good and what is bad. This movie is not horrific, but it does not belong in the same line as the previous two. Will not watch again.</p></body></html>

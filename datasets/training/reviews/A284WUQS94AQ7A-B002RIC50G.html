<meta name="summary" content="Very disappointing..."></head><body><p>This movie is a prequel to Silence of the Lambs.  I love the whole series and the diabolical character, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, M.D..  This film, however, is the very weakest of them.  It was beautifully filmed, however, it just didn't do it for me, I can't really explain why.  Maybe because it was more like a war movie or the great Anthony Hopkins was not in it.  However, this was about the young Lecter, so Hopkins, couldn't have been in it.  The surround sound was unbelievable and during the war scenes, I heard gun fire and explosions from everywhere, like I was there.<br /><br />The movie does give us a glimpse of why Hannibal turned out the way he did.  His parents were wiped out by the Nazis during World War II and his young sister (Misha) killed and eaten by starving soldiers.  He was the only member of his family to survive and he received no mental counseling.  Hannibal grows up to seek revenge on all those involved with Misha's death.<br /><br />A friend of mine, CLINT BRONSON, placed a comment on one of my reviews, Red Dragon (a great film in the Hannibal Lecter series) that stated, "These are movies that are great for school bullies to watch. For they pick on a kid who is weaker or a nerd. But the kid grows up! And likes knives and never forgives!"  I didn't know what he meant at the time and questioned the comment, but he should have told me to watch this movie and that would explain.  I must apologize CLINT, for not understanding your comment.  For this truly is a movie for school bullies to watch.  Hannibal does get revenge on those who wronged him and his family.<br /><br />While I was very disappointed in this film---it does explain Hannibal's mental state and why he commits those atrocious killings and you should watch all of the series in sequence starting with this one, then Manhunter, Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal.</p></body></html>

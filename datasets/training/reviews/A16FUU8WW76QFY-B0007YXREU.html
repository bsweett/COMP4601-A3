Maybe I'm just too old (47) to get the juvenile, excretory "humor" of this film, but I just thought it wasn't very intelligent.  Lots of stereotypes, bad songs, grossouts, and cursing (mf, f, etc.) make "Team America" an exercise in bad taste.<br /><br />It looked like a propaganda film from the Bush administration.  American actors (F.A.G.) are made to look like collaborators with Kim Jong-Il, the very strange "Dear Leader" of North Korea.  Americans who wish blow the hell out of everything are the heroes of this movie.  Thing is, I wouldn't have really cared which side the heroes or bad guys were on if this movie was really funny-which it is not.  The "gags" are gross and disgusting, and not worth laughing at.<br /><br />This was one of those "not finished" DVDs, I'm sorry to say.  When the dude puked up a Lake Michigan-sized puddle of you-know-what, that was pretty much it.</p></body></html>

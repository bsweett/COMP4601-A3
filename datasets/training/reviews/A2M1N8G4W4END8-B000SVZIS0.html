<meta name="summary" content="It WON'T Make You Sorry You Were Born a Human"></head><body><p>The detailed review:<p>There are only two commendable aspects of this 2001 &quot;re-imagining&quot; of the classic Sci-Fi allegory: The first is the musical score by composer Danny Elfman, which is simply excellent (as is nearly always the case with his work); the other--and the best--is the outstanding simian make-up work of Rick Baker and his crew.  The make-up FX for the apes in this film looks even better (i.e., more articulate and realistic) than the groundbreaking and influential make-up that John Chambers created for 1968's original PLANET OF THE APES, and had auteur Tim Burton and his crew stuck closer to the basic plot and overall socio-political subtext of the first film, they could have created a thought-provoking and aesthetically breathtaking update of what author and film historian Eric Greene calls the American myth of the 20th century.  Instead, Burton's take on PLANET OF THE APES is a tepid piece of celluloid that, while still visually stunning, is a travesty at best.<p>Okay, then, the film itself is pretty lackluster.  But what about the DVDs?  In this day and age when technology allows tons of information to be packed onto one or two little plastic-and-aluminum discs, many lousy films are marketed with bonus extras that are actually better than the film itself.  And the 2-Disc Special Edition of 2001's PLANET OF THE APES is a prime example.  It is loaded with lots of cool bonus features like commentaries (one by Burton; the other by composer Elfman) and deleted scenes, but the real treats are the featurettes that take the viewer behind the scenes in several aspects of the making of the film.  Just a few of the items discussed: The creation a special &quot;school&quot; for the actors so they could learn to move like an ape; costume design and creation; make-up FX; music for the film; and much more.  Even for a rather dull remake like this film, learning a bit about how the cinematic illusions are created is fascinating.  This alone makes the 2-Disc set worth purchasing.  (Note: the 1-Disc version that is also being marketed offers extras, too, but this includes only the two feature commentaries and some very limited behind-the-scenes stuff that can be accessed while viewing the flick.)<p><br />The compendiary review: <p>Tim Burton's &quot;re-imagining&quot; of PLANET OF THE APES is a pale shadow of the original.  However, the 2-Disc Special Edition DVD from Fox Home Entertainment has some outstanding extras that actually make the package worth purchasing.  <p><br />The ratings: <p>Movie rates at 2 stars; DVD with extras deserves 4 stars.  So the average rating for the movie and feature-packed DVD set is 3 stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""I'm Doing My Part" ~ Lets Kill Bugs!"></head><body><p>Join Rico (Casper Van Dien), Dizz (Dina Meyer), Carmen (Denise Richards), Zander (Patrick Muldoon) and Carl (Neil Patrick Harris) and the rest of the gung ho Troopers in this futuristic, sci-fi, action/adventure, surreal allegorical tale of intergalactic warfare between mankind and giant bugs. The '97 film `Starship Troopers' excels in every category; special effects, action, originality, dialogue and anything else you can think of. There's nothing else like it, so "Do your part' and get the popcorn ready for the wildest ride through the galaxy one could imagine.<br /><br />Note: The film contains extreme violence and some nudity so you may not want to include any little ones in on this one.</p></body></html>

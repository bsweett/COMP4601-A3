It was about this guy nicknamed Nacho (Jack Black) who was raised in a monastery in Mexico as a cook.  He takes up wrestling (called Luchador) to raise money to buy better food for the children and to earn respect for himself.  This movie is really, really funny.  It also has a good storyline to it.  Anyone who likes Jack Black won't be disappointed with this film.</p></body></html>

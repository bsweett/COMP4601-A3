As you would expect with almost all animation done in the U. S., the artwork is flawless.  For example, Sleeping Beauty...no I mean Cinderella...no wait, Rapunzel (a very good Mandy Moore) spends all of her time barefoot.  In close ups when her foot hits the turf, you can see her toes actually spread apart as they would in reality.  The detail is amazing.  The color as good as you will ever see.  I must confess, I knew literally nothing of the story of Rapunzel other than she had long hair.  Now I do.  She was born a princess, but kidnapped by an evil woman who knew the magic, the child's hair had.  When Rap' sang, the hair glowed and could cure injuries and other maladies, including aging.  Stroking the long golden locks kept the woman, Gothel (Donna Murphy) young.  Posing as her real mother, Gothel keeps Rap' in check in their hidden tower/home.  As she gets older, Rap' wants to see the outside world and gets her chance when a good natured thief stumbles upon the tower.  Naturally the thief, Flynn Rider/Eugene (Zachary Levi) is young and hunky.  They make a deal and he helps her see the kingdom for the first time.  You can pretty much guess the rest.  They meet interesting characters along the way, deal with evil, charm the townsfolk, dispatch the bad guys and live happily ever after.  The music is always important in these movies and here I would say it is pretty good, but far from great.  There are no memorable tunes.  The story is rote, but the comedy is pretty good.  The horse steals the show and had me cracking up.</p></body></html>

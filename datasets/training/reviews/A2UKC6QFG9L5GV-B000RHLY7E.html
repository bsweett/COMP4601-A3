<meta name="summary" content="VICIOUS"></head><body><p>I didn't like much "House of 1000 Corpses", it was more like OK to me, so I didn't expect a lot from "Devil's Rejects". And I was pleasantly surprised and shocked to see what I saw, for Rejects is one of the most vicious, violent, brutal, over-the-top movies I've ever seen. It may seem quite disgusting for an unprepared person, so be aware. For a long time horror fans it's definately a tribute to classic horror flicks, but Rob Zombie did everything he could so his film would terrify and shock the audience three times more than oldies. I'd call Rejects "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" meets "Natural Born Killers" meets "From Dusk Till Dawn", and I'm sure I'm not the first person to come up with such a conclusion. Speaking of "Natural Born Killers" - I guess Mickey and Mallory Knox seem just kids in comparison with the Firefly family.<br /><br />Rob Zombie's flick knows no limits, it puts us into an atmosphere of total chaos and mayhem, and we can't help but watch it as we look at the terrible aftermath of a road accident - shocked but unable to shift our glance. Zombie's world is a wild world, it's beyond good and evil, the concept of good and evil itself does not exist there, therefore you can't tell the difference. "Devil's Rejects'" world lies completely beyond me that's why it was so shocking and impressive. When William Forsythe's character tortures the Firefly family members, I don't know whom should I feel for. And who is better - them low-lifes, or low-lifes who were hired by sheriff to hunt them? Anyhow this movie is a total mess in a good meaning of the word, I like those kinds of messes.<br /><br />Besides William Forsythe, whose performance is just awesome, and the Firefly family, we meet many actors here who are well-known to all fans of horror and B-movies of eighties: Ken Foree from "Dawn of the Dead", Leslie Easterbrook from "Police Academy", Geoffrey Lewis, Priscilla Barnes, a porn icon Ginger Lynn, Dave Sheridan from "Scary Movie", Danny Trejo for God's sakes! You'll find many familiar faces here.<br /><br />And the ending... Well, it won't be a surprise if it enters the annals of movie history some day (I'm serious).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Arresting Vision of Hope Amidst a Dystopian Future"></head><body><p>Visually arresting, CHILDREN OF MEN is one of those movies that are best appreciated after being viewed a second or third time.  The vision of the future is chilling as society frays at the edges amidst massive infertility. Governments have become increasing authoritarian and government-dispensed pills become the opiates of the masses.  The specter of human extinction looms on many levels - some manmade and others biological.<br /><br />The presence of a pregnant refugee becomes a symbol of hope and redemption as the movie's protagonist transforms from indifference to committed partisan in her journey to safety.  We can all hope that a "HUMAN PROJECT" awaits to save us from the long-term consequences of our own folly.<br /><br />A haunting soundtrack complements the cinematography.  Michael Caine turns in a brief yet masterful performance.  Not quite on the order of BLADE RUNNER (what is?), but definitely worth seeing!</p></body></html>

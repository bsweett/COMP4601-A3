<meta name="summary" content="Fun Action Romp"></head><body><p>Independence Day. Full of special effects, aliens, airplanes, UFOs, and big big explosions. All kinds of fun stuff! When earth is targeted by a clan of power-hungry aliens, the President and a group of unexpected people must help save the world. <p>  This has got to be one of the funnest movies out there. It's got everything needed in a movie. Action (That's what the movie is all about), drama (A couple of subplots that were dealt with very nicely and not left open), comedy (Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Randy Quaid - what do you expect from these great actors?), horror (I count the &quot;jump&quot; moments given by the aliens as horror), and of course, science fiction (Er...the aliens). The extensive cast is full of A list actors and actresses, as well as some unknowns, and all pull through with great performances. And I must say, when Bill Pullman gives his own &quot;Independence Day&quot; speech, I was ready to fight the aliens with them. I also enjoyed how each group of characters were given their own subplots, and those subplots were closed and didn't leave the viewers wondering how what would have happened. The special effects in ID4 were amazing. It was pretty fun to see Washington DC, Paris, and other big cities get blown to pieces. The aerial fights were also pretty awesome.<p>  The DVD lives up to its &quot;5 Star Collection&quot; title. We get the original theatrical release on one disc, and the uncut version on another. The chapter list even tells us when things are added and extended. Although there's only a 9 minute difference, it was still interesting to see it. The alternate ending is also very interesting. The &quot;fake-amentaries&quot; and news reports are fun to watch. There's plenty of stuff here to keep you busy for at least a couple of hours. There's even 2 easter eggs. I'll let you find them. <p> Independence Day is a fun action romp, and is fun every time you watch it. I'm glad it was given a worthy DVD.</p></body></html>

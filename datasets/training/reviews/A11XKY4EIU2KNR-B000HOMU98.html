It is by the far the greatest 'boot camp' sequence ever filmed by Hollywood. Ermy will have you howling with laughter at every profanity infested tyrade. You can hwatch the boot camp 'mini movie' all by itself and never tire of it.<p>The second half has it's moments, but fails tragicly in comparison to the first half. If the entire movie had been boot camp, this would be one of the most watched and entertaining movies of all time.<p>5 stars for the first half<br />2 stars for the second.</p></body></html>

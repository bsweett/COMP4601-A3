<meta name="summary" content="Jack Black as the demented Pied Piper of Rock 'n' Roll"></head><body><p>I really had heightened expectations for &quot;School of Rock,&quot; because I tend to really like movies where people find an excuse to get up and play songs.  Besides, there was such good word of mouth on this film as well and I liked Jack Black's performance at the end of &quot;Shallow Hall.&quot;  This time around Black plays Dewey Finn, who has been kicked out of the rock band he created because he tends to confuse his commitment to the power of rock 'n' roll with the gratification of his own ego.  He cons his way into a gig as a substitute teacher for a fifth-grade class at a private school and as soon as he finds out some of these kids can actually play instruments he start turning them into a rock band.  The goal is to go head-to-head with his old group and beat them into the ground at the upcoming Battle of the Bands.  He also gives his cherubs an education in rock, mainly because he is so appalled at their lack of knowledge.  <p>Granted, there is a certain predictability to the plot here, but &quot;School of Rock&quot; does not fall into a similar trap with the characters.  Dewey does not get changed in the process as much as have his eyes opened to what is happening when you really collaborate in creating music and playing in a band.  In simpler terms, he starts practicing what he has been preaching.  As for the kids, they follow their rock 'n' roll Pied Piper's lead but they also are more than willing to stand up and get in Dewey's face.  <p>I actually wanted more of a rock education for the viewing audience.  There is a nice little scene where Dewey has laid out a constellation chart of rock groups on the board, but instead of hearing him lecture we get the music on the soundtrack turned up loud.  Old viewers will of course recognize the names that Dewey drops throughout the film, but I kept thinking it would be nice if there were a few choice instances where Dewey drove home a couple of key points to the kidlets.  In other words, do with words what is done with music when Dewey teaches the kid who plays guitar the riffs for &quot;Sunshine Of Your Love,&quot; &quot;Iron Man,&quot; and &quot;Smoke on the Water,&quot; or the keyboard player the opening of &quot;Touch Me.&quot;  <p>You can guess what is happening at the end, but that does not take away from the overall sense of fun, especially for younger viewers who will enjoy the fact the kids are all doing their own singing and playing.  I have just been comparing such musical grand finales to the end of &quot;Uptown Girls,&quot; and I find this one to be okay (the song was not up to the kids).  There are some efforts to take advantage of Joan Cusack playing the head of the school, but she really is underutilized (I was expecting more off of the Stevie Nicks reference).  These things just underscore not only that &quot;School of Rock&quot; could have been better but that we really would have liked this 2003 film to have made it all the way to the next level.</p></body></html>

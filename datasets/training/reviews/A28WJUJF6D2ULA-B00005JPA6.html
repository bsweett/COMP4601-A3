<meta name="summary" content="The Most Imaginative Film In Years"></head><body><p>I confess that I thought the real world storyline set in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War was actually more interesting then the visually-spectacular but lightly plotted fairy tale segments, though these were impressively imaginative and at times beautiful to behold, just not long enough or very well explained. The actors all did excellent jobs in this violent cinematic outing, and the placing of the story in a dense, dark forest worked very well too. The main reason I am going out on a wobbly limb and giving this movie four stars instead of five is that to be brutally honest, I think Pan's Labyrinth left a lot needing to be explained. It has one of those plots that simply hands out what there is and leaves you no choice to but to take what you're given, sans much background or annotation of the mythology of its inner soul. It should have been a little bit longer and taken more time to make us feel more aware of what was at stake in Ofelia's quest. After the movie was done I felt like a huge chapter was missing. But did I like Pan's Labyrinth? Very much so. It had an originality that is sadly rare in the motion picture industry. It's also a movie that deserves to be watched in high definition, if you can.</p></body></html>

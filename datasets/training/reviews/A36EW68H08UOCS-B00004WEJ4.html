<meta name="summary" content="The PERFECT movie with a perfect transfer DVD - good extras"></head><body><p>For those who attention spans are are too short or who think of the Matrix as &quot;Deep&quot; - I recommend &quot;Casablanca&quot; - the perfect movie.  Star-crossed lovers have never been more heartbreakingly portrayed than Bogart and Bergman.  The supporting cast and the script are perfect.  The photography is transferred with museum-quality perfection to this DVD.  The movie as it currently exists is so perfect - it is almost inconceivable to consider that up to the end of shooting they toyed with a different ending.  &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; may have a reputation of being called &quot;The Greatest Movie&quot; more often than &quot;Casablanca&quot;, and it is technically brilliant - but the characters of Casablanca visit my dreams often and vividly, and I never dream of Charles Foster Kane and his screen partners.<p>Bogart is perfectly tough and tender-hearted.  Ingrid Bergman is perfectly beautiful and torn between her noble husband and the man she loved earlier in Paris. <p>This movie is, in short - perfect.  I'll not give another film a higher recommendation unless something higher comes along.  To date the film that is superior to Casablanca does not exist.</p></body></html>

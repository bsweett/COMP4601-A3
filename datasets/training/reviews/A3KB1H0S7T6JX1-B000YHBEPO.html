<meta name="summary" content="A Good Action Film"></head><body><p>Mission Impossible III brings to the screen the ongoing adventures of Ethan Hunt as he battles dangerous villains.<br /><br />The former spy is called upon to retrieve a captured agent, though it might be that this time he's bitten more than he can chew...<br /><br />Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Laurence Fishburne, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the special effects, the dialogues, and the music are all good.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment</p></body></html>

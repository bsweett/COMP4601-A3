<meta name="summary" content="2.75 Stars: Better Than Expected, But Still a Weak "Reimaging" of a Classic Film."></head><body><p>Most of the reviews I've read about this film are very similar to what I feel, but I thought I would at least put my two cents in as well. Much like other reviews, I'm a big fan of the original Planet of the Apes. Since this film's release, I've heard bad things about it, and I chose to stay away from it until recently. After finally watching it for the first time, I can't say it was as bad I thought it would be. However, its definitely not on the level of the original film at all. For me, the biggest problem is differences in the story that just doesn't make sense when compared to the original film(s). For example, how are the humans able to speak? Or can only some of them? Besides the Leo character, I believe there was only 4 humans speaking in the film. The rest kinda stood around blankly. Yet, they apparently could understand what was being said. For some or all humans to be able to understand and speak, it takes away the uniqueness of the Leo character (Wahlberg)that should have made him special. That was a very important plot device in the original film. Also there seems to be some weird attempt to have some sort of sexual tension between Leo and the ape Ari. It's just odd, and thankfully it didn't develop further in the film. As for the "surprise" ending that has gotten a lot of criticism, maybe it doesn't make a lot of sense. There are theories out there by fans that do attempt to explain it. However, I read that Tim Burton himself said it wasn't supposed to make sense, so who knows. I realize the whole story arc of the Planet of the Apes films can be confusing, and any storytelling involving time travel is a recipe for confusion. But I think this was just the movie trying to be too clever and knowing that the original had a surprise ending (one of the best endings in any film I've seen, by the way), it was just a weak attempt to match it. The the effects and make-up were probably the best thing about the film. All the apes looked very good, except for the few female apes, which looked ridiculous to me! Not that the make-up was bad, but it was the way it was designed. Why did the female apes have modern human hairstyles? And I felt the make-up was too human looking to start with. You could see too much of the actress' features through the make-up. Were they trying to make the female apes more attractive? Was that the reason behind the vague love connection between Ari and Leo? I hate to say it, but honestly, Ari kinda reminded me of Michael Jackson! The acting was pretty good as well. The supporting cast includes Paul Giamatti, David Warner, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Kris Kristofferson. And even includes a cameo by Charlton Heston as an ape, which I thought was pretty cool. Mark Wahlberg was okay as the main protagonist, but of course it wasn't nothing compared to the performance of Charlton Heston in the original. Probably the best performance in the film goes to Tim Roth as the nasty General Thade. Though perhaps the character was a little too over the edge at times. In fact, I thought the depiction of the apes overall was a bit too harsh, primitive, and tyrannical. I felt that the apes had a bit more of civilized manner about them in the original. But most of them in this film seem to have an overly negative and aggressive attitude. Some people have complained about this film being too long or too boring. I didn't necessarily get bored or feel that the film was too lengthy (around 2 hours), and I thought the film was interesting and entertaining enough. However it isn't as dramatic, clever, or entertaining as the original whatsoever. I'm sure there's a lot more of other complaints I've overlooked that someone that's more familiar with the original series can, and probably have, pointed out. But for me, this film wasn't as bad as I expected, and its actually a decently made film. But when there's an attempt to remake or "re-image" a classic image, 99% of the time you're fighting a losing battle. That's probably why soon after the movie's release,  Tim Burton was quoted as saying "he'd rather jump out a window" than direct a follow-up. I'm kinda of thankful that they chose not to continue with this story, and went backward in the story arc with Rise of the Planet Apes, which is a much better film. But that's another review for another day.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WOW! ANOTHER SHOCKER FROM "ROB ZOMBIE" !!"></head><body><p>WOW..I like it a lot..<br /><br />Really disturbing kind of gory movie love he's style the way he makes movies and camera shots,Is like  back in 70s movies such I love. Really enjoy the movie was real good scary kind of western..Is like "The Dukes of Hazzard" on acid!! I bought the DVD and I am glad i did!..But compare this to House of 1000 Corpses  .I think House of 1000 Corpses was a notch scarier & goryer. But I liked this one as well a lot, Great casting and actors done the solid great job!! With double DVD set with great picture and 6.1 DTS sound and a lots extras. WOW!! SUPER..I'm glad bought the DVD for my collection. DONT MISS BUY IT!! A</p></body></html>

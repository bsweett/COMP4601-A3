Let's go round him up."></head><body><p>Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and his fellow Mayan hunters are out on the hunt and having a good time in their secluded part of the wet jungle. After making a kill, they spread out some of the body parts, and then laugh at the expense of one of the bigger hunters because of the certain part that was given to him. Just having some good manly fun. Out from the jungle though come some strangers from another tribe. They look scared and beaten. With a warning about how their village was burned and ravaged, they pass by, onto hopefully a new beginning. The next morning, Jaguar's village gets attacked. People are slaughtered and huts are burned down. Jaguar hides his wife and child and then tries to help the rest of his people, only to get captured along with a group of others. They are taken back to the village of the capturers as slaves or quite possibly for a sacrificial ceremony. As the blade is nearing closer, and hope for rain is on the horizon, Jaguar must escape to save his wife and child, who are stuck in a 100-foot pit.<br /><br />Apocalypto was definitely a surprise. For one thing, I didn't know much about what I was getting into when first watching this. I thought maybe it was about why the Mayans disappeared actually (Duh...Aliens took them to outer space). But honestly it's just a story based around the Mayan timeframe. Accurate or not, I don't know. But I did like the movie. While some of the beginning is a little slow to some, I found it fun and interesting. It was nice to see them just joking around and having a good time with one another. As my fellow co-worker said, "I wonder if they really talked or had fun like that". For instance, they play a joke on one of their friends who seems to be impotent. They told him to rub some leaves on his `wing-wang', but didn't tell him they were chili leaves (I think they were at least).  This had him running around frantically naked and even his wife was burning up to (but in a spot you might not expect). The whole village was in hysterics. The action scenes were done really well also. Some say the violence was to extreme, but I don't think so at all. The sacrificing scenes were a tad rough, and I wouldn't let a child watch, but it wasn't too bad. Even `Temple of Doom' had a crazy sacrificing scene and no one really complains about that beating heart... do they? There was maybe a little to much of Jaguar Paw dodging spears and arrows though like he was Neo though, because they were coming from behind and he would always move his head or dodge something without even seeing it.<br /><br />With Jaguar Paws tribe, we also see how peaceful they were, to only have that ripped away from them in total bewilderment by the `evil' tribe. It was sad really and I honestly felt bad for them. Their children being hurt right in front of them, wives being raped or killed, husbands being slaughtered, and then tying up the prisoners to poles and making them trek back to the `evil' guys village. And even after that, I still thought about the bad guys. It had me thinking to myself, "Are they all bad? Do they all agree with what's going on?" Because it sure didn't feel like it sometimes. It had me wondering about the preparations before hand for them. Or maybe some of them think, "Better them than me so I'll just do whatever it takes to survive in this tribe" And when we do see the bad guys place of home, it seems just like any other type of city probably at that time, well... cept for the sacrificing and stuff. But hey, that's what they believed in. Even Abraham was going to sacrifice Isaac to his God at one time to appease him. I almost wish we got a little more on the bad guy tribe. Ah well.<br /><br />In the end, I would definitely give this a shot. While it is subtitled, it's not that bad at all (it never bothers me anyways) and you honestly forget you are reading within minutes...unless of course you are eating or something. It's got a lot of good action scenes in it, and it has a great story. Jaguar Paw rocks.<br /><br />P.S. - The scene with the Jaguar, although cool as it was, looked really bad. It reminded me of Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog from Conan. It really did look like a gigantic sock puppet in a few shots. How Mel Gibson approved that I'll never know. If I was Mel I would have got a real Jaguar and let him go to town on some animal carcass or something. Eh...whatever.</p></body></html>

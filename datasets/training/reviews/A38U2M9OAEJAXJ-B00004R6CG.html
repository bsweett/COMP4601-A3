<meta name="summary" content="James Stewart, Kim Novak, and Hitch--All at Their Best"></head><body><p>I must admit that reviewing a movie like &quot;Vertigo&quot; is a bit intimidating.  Here is a classic that's been dissected, analyzed, and studied by film gurus everywhere.  What can be said about this film that hasn't been said before?  James Stewart, Kim Novak, and director Hitchcock are all at their career best.  It's startling to know that it was a box-office and critical disappointment upon release in 1958, but over the years, it has apparently since been hailed as a masterpiece.  No argument here.  Even better is the DVD presentation.  The picture is Ginsu-sharp and clear, with vibrant colors.  The guys who did the restoration apparently put a lot of love into the project.  I should also add that, as far as I know, this is the ONLY Hitchcock DVD featuring 5.1 surround sound.  At times, it reveals its age, but it works best during Bernard Hermann's awesome score.  While my favorite Hitchcock movies are &quot;North by Northwest&quot; and &quot;Psycho,&quot; this film is a confirmed classic that belongs in every collection.</p></body></html>

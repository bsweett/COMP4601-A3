<meta name="summary" content="Special Effects Rule the Day"></head><body><p>When the movie made its big-screen debut in 2004 - and continuing with the various DVD releases - debate oftentimes degenerated into questioning the actual validity of the global warming/cooling that is depicted, while seemingly forgetting that this is a Sci-Fi action adventure. It would be like giving opinions on The Da Vinci Code and One Million Years B.C. as if the films are based on historical facts.<br /><br />Produced, directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich, the special effects are absolutely incredible, but the story stumbles due to the generic characters that can plague this genre; arrogant politicians, misunderstood scientists and practical voices continually lost in the wilderness of society.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid is climatologist Jack Hall who valiantly tries to make the top political leaders in Washington, D.C., understand the harsh ramifications of the emerging storms worldwide. After tackling this tough task, he sets forth on a journey through massive ice and snow to rescue his son (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), who is trapped in New York City. Throughout the sojourn, both characters play off the themes of friendship, family and the will to survive.<br /><br />There is a nice mix of special features - including scenes edited out of the film - that are interesting. But the storms steal the show and wash away a script that was built around the big bang of special effects and had cardboard cut-outs for characters.</p></body></html>

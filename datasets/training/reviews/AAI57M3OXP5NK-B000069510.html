I enjoyed the movie but the problem with this movie is I have a hard time remembering it.  It was pretty forgettable because the storyline was pretty thin.  The actors gave pretty good performances.  If you haven't seen the movie, I would rent it first and then buy it because it is violent and thin storylined.  This is not for children.  All in all this was a good movie but if you are a Resident Evil fan you may not like this.</p></body></html>

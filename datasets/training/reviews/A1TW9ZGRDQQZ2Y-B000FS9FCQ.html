<meta name="summary" content="V is Good, Real Good"></head><body><p>This is easily the best film that I have seen in the early stages of 2006. The acting is great, with the faceless Hugo Weaving playing V with great physical presence and an intelligent voice. Natalie Portman turns in one of her best performances here which shocked me to say the least.  She even looks hot bald! The visuals, music, set design, and action scenes are perfect without being overdone. This is a thinking action film, heavy with smart dialogue and interesting ideas. Some people are looking for a buried political message about our government in this movie, but it is based on a graphic novel written long ago. The government in the film has more in common with the Nazi party and Hitler than anything going on today. I will be seeing V for Vendetta at least once more in theaters and will add the DVD to my collection the day it is released.</p></body></html>

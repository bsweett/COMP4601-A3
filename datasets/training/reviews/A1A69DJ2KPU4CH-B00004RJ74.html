Instantly you hate George Clooney's character but are intrigued at the same time because he does a bad guy so well. I have always liked Harvey Keitel and Juliet Lewis as well. The acting was pretty good across the board, the music was great, the special effects were good (some really cool looking vampires in this one), and the gore was over the top, so why the low rating? Simple, this movie takes a nose dive when it turns into a vampire movie. Not because vampires aren't cool, and not because they're done poorly (they're not), but at the unbelievable reactions of the patrons. All of a sudden it's as though all of them (the ones not initially eaten) have been expert vampire killers their whole life. There is no surprise, no sense of fear, no sense of amazement, just a sort of attitude of "okay, time to kill a bunch of vampires, yawn" As another reviewer put it, if I saw a vampire, no, make that if anyone saw a vampire they would be gripped with fear. I wanted to see some of that. The completely unrealistic reactions of the patrons turned what could have been a scary, amazing vampire thriller into a cartoon. It was even more cartoon like how they went about killing the vampires. Dropping them on a table leg with a completely flat bottom. Excuse me, but how exactly is that supposed to go through a body, unless the body is made of play dough? The vampires are so easy to kill in this movie it's only their numbers that make them a nuisance.<br /><br />It is apparent the decision was made to turn the vampire half of the movie into a kind of tongue in cheek, comedy, but it didn't work. Robert Rodriquez is a fantastic director. Planet Terror is one of my all time favorite horror movie's ever. That film managed to expertly combine humor and horror, from Dusk Till Dawn does not. This movie deserved a much better treatment of the vampire half. Serious, not "okay, the vampires are here let's start killing em." For the male viewers the movie is worth watching right till the end of the drop gorgeous Selma Hayek's sexy dance, then it can be safely turned off.</p></body></html>

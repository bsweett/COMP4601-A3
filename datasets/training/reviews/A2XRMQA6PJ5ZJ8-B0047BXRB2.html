<meta name="summary" content="A classic science fiction film.  Thoughtful and fun"></head><body><p>"Forbidden Planet" is not just another space-monster film.  The film introduces the concept of hyperdrive as a means of traveling faster than light, and overall the story is thoughtful, and contains numerous twists that add zip to the story.<br /><br />This one was far ahead of its time, and still helps set the standard for space opera science fiction.  Recommended.  RJB.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="LET THEM EAT CAKE..."></head><body><p>This is a visually sumptuous film. Nominated for an Oscar for Best Costume Design, it rightly won that Oscar. That being said, it was the only Oscar for which it could possibly have been nominated, as the film itself was a disappointment. As a lover of period dramas, I eagerly rented this film. Not even its visual beauty, however, could keep me fully engaged in a film that simply does not tell a cohesive story. Unless one is fully familiar with the story of Marie Antoinette, the film will impart little to one's knowledge of the time, place, and people. As with a meringue, a frothy, delicious confection that promises much, one will find little of substance after one bite.<br /><br />Kirsten Dunce gives a tender performance as Marie Antoinette, a young Austrian princess thrust into a role that she did not seek, who is forced to leave all that she knew and loved in order to forge an alliance between Austria and France. An ephemeral portrait of this much maligned historical figure emerges, one that is somewhat sympathetic. Moreover, the use of rock music in the film is an interesting choice, as it serves to remind the viewer that Marie Antoinette was a young girl, not much different than young girls of today, with hopes and desires of her own. Yet, hers had to be sublimated. Without something of a cogent and compelling narrative, however, the story of Marie Antoinette falls by the wayside.<br /><br />While the social climate of France, which serves as a necessary counterpoint for the excesses of Marie Antoinette's court, is alluded to, it is little more of a blip in the film. This social event that caused two worlds to eventually collide, as the French Revolution became a reality rather than just a political theory, remains as elusive as the focal point of the film itself. The historical context of Marie Antoinette's reality, that is, the events that propelled her into the annals of history, is barely a footnote.<br /><br />Although the story of Marie Antoinette is historically a poignant one, the director, Sofia Coppola, simply  fails to tell a cohesive story, as the film meanders along, a tribute to extravagance and beauty but little else. This film, therefore, remains an elevation of form over substance. While loosely based upon a biography of Marie Antoinette by Antonia Fraser, it is little wonder that the author went on the record to disavow herself of this film.  I can also fully understand why this film was booed at the Cannes Film Festival. It is simply little more that a yawn yarn, though a visually enticing one. Unfortunately, the film's stunning visuals are not enough to fill the empty shell of this film.<br /><br />If one is not a fan of period pieces, deduct one star from my rating.</p></body></html>

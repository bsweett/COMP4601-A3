But then what if a film gets unanimous acclaim and everyone enjoys it yet you didn't like it from the start or just simply were too slow to notice its faults or greatness? Such was the case with Magnolia which I found on first viewing to be incredibly self-indulgent and seemed as if it wanted to do anything it can so that people can see what a complex and ambitious work it was. Second viewing? I liked it more.<br /><br />The film has a wide assortment of characters with the key being that they all intersect and through association, know each other. But basically we have a self-help guru for men (Tom Cruise), a talk show host (Philip Baker Hall), an ailing old man (Jason Robards), his wife (Julianne Moore) and his nurse (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), the talk show host's daughter (Melora Walters) who meets a nice cop one day (John C. Reilly), and a former contestant on the show (William H. Macy). The film takes on the issues of death, consequence and fate and whether things can really be called coincidences.<br /><br />Magnolia I think is one of those kind of films where there's just a genuine spunk of energy and spontaneity that even if you didn't like it, you had to admit there's a lot of passion to make it work and everyone gives it their all. From rock-solid performances all around from Cruise (yes, I said him: forget the crazy antics, when he wants, he CAN act) to the Reilly/Walters story to the confidence in the writing and directing, it's a film I can certainly appreciate. But that don't mean it isn't completely flawless: the length might get to people (3 hours and 10 mins or so), the frogs will completely come out of left field if it wasn't spoiled before and some storylines or characters could've been exorcised completely. On and the tagline might as well be "we may be through with the past but the past ain't through with us" so it's repeated no less than 4 times.<br /><br />But the film for all its issues never once gets dull or you start to tune out of the whole story. From the characters to even the pacing and several memorable moments, there's always something that'll click. And when something doesn't, such as a cop's run-in with a profanity-spewing woman (like every word of dialogue literally has a swear in it it seems) or a long stretch of scenes accompanied by tense score that makes it seem like a 20 minute long crescendo, there's character moments like a bedside confessional or the delightful closing shot that helps bring the film back. It might not all work but not once does it feel incoherent or sloppy.<br /><br />1999 was a huge year for movies with stuff like the Blair Witch Project doing something different and fresh though not altogether innovative to American Beauty which brought with it more indie-minded filmmaking to the Matrix and its visuals, Magnolia fits right in. Not the most accessible film in his oeuvre and even polarizing for some but it can connect with some.</p></body></html>

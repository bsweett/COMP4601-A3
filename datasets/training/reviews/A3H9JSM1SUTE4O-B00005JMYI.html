<meta name="summary" content="NOT THAT FUNNY"></head><body><p>A silly goofball comedy set somewhere in TV's dark ages of two decades ago, "Anchorman" is about a San Diego TV news anchor (Will Farrell) who is also a self-aggrandizing, chauvenistic simpleton with a nice voice and a good mustache.  His world is rocked by the new feminist reality when a pretty female anchor (Christina Applegate) takes up space at the once all male desk.<br /><br />Farrell's OK as the pompous Bergundy but is nowhere near his inspired and sympathetic "Elf" character.<br /><br />There are 22 deleted scenes in the nearly one hour of extras.  Highlights are Burgundy's conversation with Bill Curtis for the "Radio and TV Hall of Fame" and his disastrous ESPN job interview.<br /><br />The nearly uncensored, exceedingly crude, sophomoric but sometimes funny commentary track for this special edition is NOT for kids or the faint of heart.</p></body></html>

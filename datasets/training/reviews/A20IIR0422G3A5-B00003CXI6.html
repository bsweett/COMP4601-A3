<meta name="summary" content="A good but not great homage to Hitchcock"></head><body><p>'What Lies Beneath' directed by Robert Zemeckis ends with a very satisfying bang / surprise, but it is just a bit tedious in getting there. Contrary to the blurbs on the jacket, the movie does not live up to Hitchcock's quality and does not do for the bathtub what 'Psycho' did for the shower.<br /><br />While it is not as bad as the most critical reviews, it does not add lots of points to its stars' resumes, as it simply does not effectively use the ambiguity between psychosis and the supernatural as we see in Hitchcock and the best of Stephen King.<br /><br />Nice surprise in the casting and in the technique used to attempt murder. Otherwise, average.</p></body></html>

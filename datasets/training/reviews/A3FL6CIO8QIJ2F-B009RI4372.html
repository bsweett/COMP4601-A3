Budgeted at around $300,000, the film would become a modest hit at the boxoffice and ultimately garner a cult following after it was released on home video and DVD. The story deals with five college students who embark themselves on a deserted cabin in Tennessee. When they find an audio recording that releases evil spirits all hell breaks loose. Don't watch this if you have a weakness for scary films as "The Evil Dead" is probably the most gruesome horror flick I have ever witnessed, even more so than "The Exorcist". Running at just under 90 minutes, the DVD comes with audio commentary by its director/writer Sam Raimi and producer Robert Topert, behind the scenes footage and outtakes, trailer, TV spots, and more. There is an informative booklet that accompanies the disc as well. When the film was released on DVD by Anchor Bay the movie was fully restored with renewed video and audio quality. Turn the lights out, grab the popcorn, and watch this little gem. Trust me; you will be scared!</p></body></html>

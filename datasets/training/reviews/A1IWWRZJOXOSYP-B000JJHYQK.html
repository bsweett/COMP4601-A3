He does an adequate job of keeping the action moving.  Following "Timeline" with Peter Walker & "Oceans 12," screenwriter George Nolfi's 3rd screenplay bears some of the problems why this film doesn't work completely.  The major problem is that Michael Douglas' character is part hero & anti-hero.  As a loyal patriot trying to protect the president, we cheer him on.  But as the two-timing adulterer who has an affair with the First Lady, we wonder how stupid he really is & how can a hero be morally inferior?  This is the crux for me of why it's hard to cheer for the film.<br /><br />However, given the material, Michael Douglas turns in a good performance as Pete Garrison.  It's been a long time since Douglas first broke on the scene with TV's "The Streets of San Francisco" & since his 1987 Oscar for "Wall Street."  He still brings a good studied intensity to the screen and gives a believable performance, while not really addressing why this man has character flaws that lead him to cheat on the president.  For the story's purpose, it is this vulnerability that leads to Garrison's compromise and pursuit to prove his innocence.<br /><br />Other actors also do a good job.  Kim Basinger who won her Oscar a decade after Doglas (1997) for "L.A. Confidential" does a good job as Sarah Ballentine.  She exudes a studied elegance that well suits a first lady, but again we fail to understand why she's so overcome with passion for Douglas.  Kiefer Sutherland who won the Golden Globe for TV's "24" in 2001 and has appeared in the movies in "Eye of the Killer," "Phone Booth," & "Taking Lives," does a good job as David Breckinridge who bears a grudge against his former best friend, but seeks out the truth.  Eva Longoria from "Desperate Housewives" on TV does a by-the-book performance as Jill Maren.  Blair Brown cameos as the press secretary.  David Rasche does a good job as a president.  His is a familiar face from films like "United 93" & "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood."  All in all, this is an interesting evening's entertainment, even if it does not make you stand around and cheer afterwards.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

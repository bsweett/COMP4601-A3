<meta name="summary" content="What a character-driven movie should be"></head><body><p>"Mystic River" definitely falls in the category of "character-driven" film.  It succeeds brilliantly, and is a benchmark for movies where character and not plot take center stage.<br /><br />First, you must have a plot, even if it's not the centerpiece of the movie.  Too many "character-based" dramas are meandering messes that go nowhere.  In contrast, "Mystic River" has enough of a plot to keep things moving, and it's interesting.<br /><br />Second, you must have a good script.  Oftentimes "character-driven" movies are tedious at best, because the characters have nothing to say.  Here, the screenwriter really created some memorable characters and great dialogue.  I am sure that Robbins, Bacon and Penn had a lot to do with that, too.<br /><br />That leads into point three - you must have great actors to breathe life into your characters, when your characters are your movie.  Robbins, Bacon and Penn have never been better, and each do a fantastic job.  Their performances are engrossing, and keep the film from dragging.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

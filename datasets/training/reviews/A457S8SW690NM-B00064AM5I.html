<meta name="summary" content="A descent comedy that wasn't as funny as it should have been"></head><body><p>3 and 1/2 stars<br /><br />I am a big Ben Stiller fan and I also like Vince Vaughn. So, I had some big expectations before watching this movie. While it does have a fair share of laughs, it just wasn't very funny. The movie is about Average Joes Gym, a gym that needs 50,000 dollars to keep the building. So, Vince Vaughn and company form a dodgeball team and enter into a dodgeball tournament to get the money. But, squaring off against them are the people from the popular Globo Gym. They square off in a funny tournament on ESpN 8, the ocho. Vaughn and Stiller are good as are the rest of the cast but this movie wasn't as funny as it could have been. This isn't a good comedy to add to your collection but is a worthy rent with some classic jokes. This is a lot better than BE COOl!!!!!!!! This is a solid comedy that doesn't have enough gas to be one of my favorite comedies.</p></body></html>

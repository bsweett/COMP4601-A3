It's been a long time since a musical this wonderful has been released.  Nobody knew that any of the actors could sing so well, though they had to attend intensive voice lessons before filming.  I loved how they switch periodically from their life(speaking mostly) to their fantasy(singing on stage).  The costumes and stage setting was amazing to look at.  "Chicago" was well deserving for its six Oscar wins, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress(Catherine Zeta-Jones).  I expected more wins, but that's okay.  This will be a classic years from now!</p></body></html>

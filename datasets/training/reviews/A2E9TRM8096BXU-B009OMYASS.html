I was even looking forward to debunking it here as overhyped, unimaginative, sadistic drivel long before I actually saw it. I don't think I can be blamed for this. the present, rather depressing trend of horror movies - which for some years has been towards "horror" (meaning disgust) rather than "terror" (meaning the good scare) - has left me itching to pull the trigger on most every new entry in the genre that passes my way, and mostly this urge has been justified.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. As a rule I despise horror movies designed largely to gross out or disturb the audience (I'm looking at you, Rob Zombie), and that is why I wanted to damn the film even before I saw it. And indeed, HOSTEL is truly "horror" in the disturbing sense, since the actual movie itself is far less scary than its concept of torture and murder as a sort of underground entertainment industry.<br /><br />Many of HOSTEL's critics contend that the film is one-half softcore porn and one-half snuff film. Others point out its many implausibilities. A few hold out that the "heroes" are all jerks and make it impossible for the audience to care about them. Some are just disgusted by the torture, which is as graphic as it is vicious. Most of this is true. The first half of the film IS very slow and replete with naked women; the second half DOES show people being horribly tortured and in some cases killed for the sick pleasure of others (surely the definition of snuff); there are a number of implausible and even ridiculous moments, the "good" characters are none of them very good people. But surprisingly, I found that these things did not matter, or at least mattered less than they might have, because of the movie's surprising strengths.<br /><br />First, the acting. It is not great, but it is uniformly good, much better than in most horror movies. The guy who plays Josh is particularly effective in his torture scenes - almost too believable. And the torturers themselves are frighteningly convincing. Second, the way the film opens, with dark-lit scenes of the torture-chair and tools being washed clean of blood by a whistling, unseen figure, strikes a deep creep into your spine - even before we're introduced to them, we know our cavorting post-collegiates are going to end up in it; the chair acts like a horrible magnet throughout the movie, drawing them slowly but surely into its comfortless seat. Third, the concept is just believable enough to do for backpackers in Europe what JAWS did for swimmers in the Atlantic; the idea that this type of thing, in some form or other, does occasionally go on in this world makes suspension of disbelief less necessary than usual in a horror flick.<br /><br />It is true that the main protagonist, Paxton, is obnoxious, pushy and much less likeable than either the funnyman Oli, or the sensitive weakling, Josh; but that did not make his ultimate outburst of revenge-crazed heroics less believable. On the contrary, if any of the three of them were going to kick some torturer a*s, he was the likeliest candidate. And he isn't all bad; midway through the flick he expresses remorse over freezing years back when he might have saved a girl from drowning; and at the end, when he hears the Asian girl scream in agony, he risks his life to rescue her from the blowtorch-wielding "American Businessman." I have to say in this connection that a lot of the things people read into this movie just aren't there - the mild anti-Americanism is meant as a kind of in-joke for its American audience, not insulting to us, and the nudity and sex at the beginning, far from being a heavy-handed morality message (illicit exploitative sex = horrible but deserved death) were mainly used to distract the censors from the gore at the end (it worked, by the way).<br /><br />HOSTEL is not a great film by any means. It has many standard horror-movie flaws and one can certainly question the wisdom and morality of further desensitizing our already violence-numbed populace by purveying this type of thing as "entertainment." Still, horror is defined as "a painful emotion of fear, dread or abhorrence" and on that score, HOSTEL certainly lives up to its billing.</p></body></html>

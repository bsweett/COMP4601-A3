<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable sequel"></head><body><p>Some sequels turn out to be really bad, but this one was highly enjoyable (if not as good as the first) and I really liked the character of Davy Jones, man oh man what a great villain! Johnny Deep does a great job as Jack Sparrow (as usual) and if you liked the first movie, you definitely should enjoy this!</p></body></html>

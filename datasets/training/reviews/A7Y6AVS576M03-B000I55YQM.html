<meta name="summary" content="New Perspective on Axelrod's Original Script"></head><body><p>1962's THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE directed by John Frankenheimer and starring Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, Janet Leigh, Angela Lansbury, Henry Silva, John McGiver, James Gregory and Leslie Parrish is a cinematic classic. It is a modern day tale of unspeakable psychological horrors. Frankenheimer's style of mixing tension and political cynicism span the gamut of dark humor to nail biting anxiety of the white-knuckle variety. Underneath it all Frankenheimer never loses sight of the cost of these transgressions and he subliminally reminds us of the human tragedy and loss caused by them, which is somewhat what this entire film seems to be about. 2004's THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a bit of a conundrum and almost seems like a homage to Frankenheimer's classic. The script based on George Axelrod's original, which in turn was based on the novel by Richard Condon, is confusing and ethereal. Lost in this script is Frank Sinatra's original character of the dedicated and logically minded, yet intuitively driven, army officer Marco. Here Washington is a sympathetic and frustrated failure. Liev Schreiber's performance as the human pawn Raymond Shaw is much more successful but the viewer truly has to read between the lines when compared to Laurence Harvey's brilliant, poignant and tragic performance in the original. Meryl Streep's performance as Raymond Shaw's mother is laughable and is not anywhere near the stature of Angela Lansbury's penetrating performance in the original. 2004's THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE's is a curiosity piece and may actually be making a statement about cinematic re-makes.</p></body></html>

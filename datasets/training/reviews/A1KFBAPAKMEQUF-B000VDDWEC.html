<meta name="summary" content="Not Scary At All"></head><body><p>I'm not sure why this is classified as a "horror" or "zombie" film.  For me it was romantic, funny at times, adventurous, dramatic, touching, etc.  Mucho chemistry between Selena and Jim and a fast-moving plot.<br /><br />A very entertaining movie, which ironically I avoided for years because I thought it would be too scary.  Didn't find it scary at all.  Found it to be great.  Could have done without the "f" bombs though.<br /><br />Won't spoil the plot for you, but will say that this movie should be classified as "sci-fi", which is what it is as it presents a future Britain undergoing the after effects of a nation-wide virus.  Watch and enjoy!!</p></body></html>

True, future Jason flicks had almost nothing to do with the original story, but this is where the legend began. Jason Voorhees, a mongoloid boy drowns in Crystal Lake during the summer of 1957. In 1958, Jason's mother kills two camp counselors just when they are about to have sex. Then we are told there were a series of fires that started around the camp, but no one knew who was responsible.<p>Fast forward to the `present day', June 13. The Camp is going to reopen, but the residents have already renamed the place Camp Blood. The camp counselors assemble and are preparing to get the camp ready for the summer's youngsters. Naturally there first night there, there is a terrible rain storm (It's gonna blow through here like a son of a gun!). One by one the counselors are killed off until only Amy remains. In the end she confronts and kills Mrs. Voorhees by decapitating her with a machete. Guess that's why the machete is Jason's favorite weapon of choice.<p>The final scene in the boat made everyone jump who saw this film for the first time and wasn't expecting it. To see young Jason leap out and grab Amy from behind is still to this day one of the most disturbing films ever shot.<p>This is not one of the goriest Jason films by far, but it had some good kills. One counselor who never even reaches the camp gets her throat slit convincingly as she leans against a tree. Kevin Bacon had the best kill with a spear coming up through his neck. His girlfriend got a nice little axe to the head too. Two deaths aren't even shown but we see the bodies later. The head counselor gets stabbed through the stomach, but we only see his facial expression. The great scene of Mrs. Voorhees getting her head cut off is great too. Not only does it look so real, but the way the slow motion starts and her hands try to reach where her head once were is very disturbing. A great film and a good history lesson for those who have no idea how the whole `Jason' thing started.</p></body></html>

Fortunately this has enabled me to get the blu-ray edition without having to replace a DVD.<br /><br />The film: Most of us know the story which revolves around the famous shoot-out at the OK Corral. In my view this is the best of the many film versions you can get. The reasons are many, but Val Kilmers performance as Doc Holliday is first on the list. His delivery of some classic lines and his look are quite brilliant. Rest assured there some other teriffic performances, but his is the best by quite a margin. The direction is straightforward and the script keeps you guessing nicely in places. Sometimes the obvious doesn't happen.....<br /><br />Flaws: Its perhaps a little too long at 2:10 and maybe could have been trimmed a little. But I can't think where though, so this is a minor point.<br /><br />The Blu-ray: Overall this is a very good transfer to blu-ray. The picture is very sharp and the sound excellent. Only in a couple of interior shots could I fault the picture, where I thought it was a little grainy. Obviously I don't have a DVD to compare the blu-ray with but I'd be very surprised if its anywhere near as good overall.<br /><br />Extras: Not substantial, but there is a very good documentary with some comparitively recent interviews with the cast and some interesting historical background to the events portrayed and the lengths the production team went for historical accuracy. For example they used the actual Wyatt Earp Peacemaker in the film (his gun).<br /><br />Overall: 5 stars no question!</p></body></html>

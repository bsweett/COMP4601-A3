<meta name="summary" content="THE EYES HAVE IT"></head><body><p>It's her eyes.  It's rare for an actress to make such expressive and impressive use of their eyes.  Nicole Kidman does this in "The Others."  It reminded me of the underrated Lara Parker (Angelique on the old "Dark Shadows" soap).  Ms. Parker also was able to say a million words with those eyes.  Just as Nicole does in this eerily effective thriller.  Alejandro Amenabar's direction is right on target, with the slow, yet tense, pacing; the impeccable cinametography; the great score which Amenabar also wrote; and of course, casting Nicole Kidman in the title role.  We meet Grace as she is awakening from some kind of nightmare, screaming.  The house she lives in is spookier than one would imagine for a "modern day" movie.  However, being set in the 1940's, it becomes as integral character as the humans.  Along with Ms. Kidman, Fionnaula Flannagan is superb as the mysterious housekeeper Mrs. Mills.  Also effective is Alikena Mann in the role of Ann, the precocious daughter.  James Bentley as Nicholas is also perfect.  Amenabar manages to meld old-time spook scares with a religiously influenced plot.  Although the ending is telegraphed early on, it's resolution is quite a turn of events.<br />Kidman certainly has proven she can emerge from the shadow of ex-hubby Cruise, and stand on her own as a versatile and talented actress.  She will win an Oscar someday; particularly if she handles roles as magnificently as Grace.<br />RECOMMENDED.</p></body></html>

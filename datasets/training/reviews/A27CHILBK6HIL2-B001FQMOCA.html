<meta name="summary" content="A Formulaic Film, But The Acting Is Superb. It Is Very Well Done"></head><body><p>MOVIE: James Mangold takes us into the formulaic yet satisfying life of the great Johnny Cash. Like all biopics, we have the protagonist who has had a troubled past and overcomes his inner demons to finally get his life back on track. It's pretty much the same senerio for every musical artist. Joaquin Phoenix gives one helluva performance as Cash, and he does it with his eyes. During the musical scenes when Pheonix is performing, you can't help but just stare into his eyes that give off the emotional state that he is singing in. The film is told as a flashback, and we start in Cash's childhood where he suffers the loss of his brother in a tragic accident. His father screams out loud that the devil took the wrong son, and that fuels the troubled past that haunts Cash as an adult. We've all heard the story before, whether it be Cash's story or any other singer/songwriter's. He gets his big break and makes a record, starts touring, falls in love with the lovely Reese Witherspoon who playes June Carter to perfection, uses drugs and alcohol to ease the pain of his past, conquers his problems, and comes to accept life and starts to live it. While it may seem formulaic, the film itself is a fascinating and emotional watch. It's very much like this year's Cinerella Man, a film that is totally formulaic but still brilliantly executed. Mangold, while he has no visual style, does provide a consistent direction for the film that doesn't lose the focus of the audience. The musical scenes are breathtaking and it's all thanks to the brilliant acting. What is even more impressive is that no V/O work was done. Phoenix and Witherspoon did all their own singing, which always adds to the authenticity. The film is a great experience for movie goers, and you'll probably find yourself with a few Johnny Cash tunes on your ipod afterwards.<br /><br />ACTING: Oscar nods for both Phoenix and Witherspoon are going to happen, the performances were absolutly stunning and just incredibly amazing, did I mention the acting was good? Phoenix won't win the Oscar for this one though, I just don't see the Academy giving it to Foxx for Ray last year and now for another musical biopic. Golden Globe? Definately not out of the question.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: A story we've all heard before, but it always feels fresh when it's done well. In this case it was done extremely well, the movie was great.</p></body></html>

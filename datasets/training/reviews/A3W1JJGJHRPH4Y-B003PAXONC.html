I thought this movie stood up well to previous movie. The movie started well. New York City never looked so desolate and it felt real. Will Smith was in a tough role and he carried it off well. Smith had the almost the first half of the entire movie focused on him. No one to talk to except a dog. He does an amazing job of engaging the audience. The relationship with the dog was great. The dog deserved the academy award. The death of the dog scene was truly horrifying.<br /><br />The main problem with the movie was that the ending was rushed. Once the dog died, the movie quickly jumped to the final act. As if the director knew where he wanted to go, but did not know how to get there. Another problem is that the zombies were poorly done.<br /><br />In conclusion, thanks to Will Smith I enjoyed the movie. The beginning was great. The middle seemed rushed. The ending was good, but strange.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="UNFORGIVEN in Beantown"></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood has made another powerful film that, like his brutal Western UNFORGIVEN, plunges into the murky depths of justice and evil.<p>In UNFORGIVEN, the story's impetus is a brutalized prostitute.  In MYSTIC, it's a molested child.  Gene Hackman's Oscar-winning lawman now becomes Sean Penn's Oscar-winning backroom gangster and the moment of evil revealing itself--Clint's final snarling threats as he rides out of UNFORGIVEN and Laura Linney's whispered justifications in MYSTIC--are unsettling and disorienting.<br />Exactly as Clint meant them to be.<p>Am I saying they're the same movie?  No.  Each one stands on its own and the performances are outstanding in both.<br />But both films take its viewers into dark uncharted waters where there are no white hats or black hats.<br />Like life, they're just not that easy.</p></body></html>

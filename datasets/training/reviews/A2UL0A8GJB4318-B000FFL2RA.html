<meta name="summary" content=""Kingdom of Heaven" Falters"></head><body><p>Nothing.  Everything.  On its' surface, "Kingdom of Heaven" seems like everything desirable in a giant scaled monolith of an epic.  Director Ridley Scott (Gladiator) flexes his visual  muscle, and he shines in overwhemling battle sequences, aided by John Mathiesons' sweeping camerawork and Dody Dorns' forceful editing, both of which are crafted with extraordinary skill.  A picturesque cast attempt illuminate a story about religious conflict that has overt parallels to today.  But "Kingdom of Heaven" commits the cardinal sin of epic moviemaking: it let the story play second chair to its' own visual splendor.  "Kingdom of Heaven" is not unsalvagable, but nothing is a better catylist for the audiences' indifference than a two and a half hour epic that is content with a second hand story and a first class look.  It expects the audience to be accepting of shoddy goods delivered in a lovely package.  The trick doesn't work.<br /><br />"Heaven" opens in twelfth century France, when a young blacksmith named Balian (Orlando Bloom) takes up his father's (Liam Neeson) challenge to venture to Jerusalem on Crusade, but only after he kills a priest for desecrating his wifes' dead body.  Balian now has two reasons to travel to the Middle East.  Being in a Crusade with absolve him of his sins and that of his wifes,' who committed suicide.  The Crusades themselves are in full, bloody swing, as rival Muslim and Christian armies vie for the Holy Land.  Some are fanatical.  But all fanatics are outdone by the Knights Templar, led by Guy De Lusignan (Marton Csokas) and Reynald (Brendan Gleeson).  The Christian zealots, looking for power and wealth, bide their time as they await the death of the young, leperous but progressive King Baldwin (Edward Norton uncredited), who has fashioned a fragile peace with his contemporary, Saladin (Ghassan Massoud).  The Templars eventually get a golden oppurtunity, potentially spoiled by the presence of Balian, who Baldwin admires and his sister (Eva Green) takes a liking to.<br /><br />Even though the film is fatally flawed, that does not mean it still has plenty going for it.  Ridley Scott still stages battle scenes with muscular verve, and the sieging of Jerusalem is spectacular.  He's blessed with a great supporting cast.  Edward Norton and Ghasson Massoud embody understated grace as leaders trying to hold a peace and hold onto the prospect of a better future even as religious wars flare around them.  Liam Neeson once again proves no one is better than him at playing the wise mentor and Jeremy Irons still purrs with his gravelly tenor, giving emotional weight to the kingly advisor Tiberias, a warrior who sees the Crusades clearer then almost anyone around him.<br /><br />But all of those strengths are peripheral to the main plotline and Bloom.  The films' credibility is stretched too far by debut screenwriter William Monahan, who makes Balians' journey from lowly blacksmith to superknight too abrupt and too easy.  Once he reaches the Holy Land, the new Crusader has the foresight to dig a well on his inherited land (which apparently his father never thought of doing beforehand), hold court with the King and his templar rivals and command armies in battle.  The scenario is too implausible to believe and the film feels distant because of it.  Bloom, to his credit, gives the role everything he's got, trying to register the look and feel of a man caught up in extraordinary circumstances, but he simply does not having the acting chops needed to pull it off.  Director Scott at times seemed to be preoccupied with the crafting of the film, letting Balians' plot arc flounder.  With so much promise in their movie, Scott and Monahan sadly let it slip, and it's a shame.  It could have, and should have been so much more.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""If You Want Something Go Get It, Period" ~ Lessons In Life And Business"></head><body><p>The recent '06 release of the DVD `The Pursuit of Happyness" provides the vehicle of yet another great performance by Will Smith, the next Denzel Washington. However the perfect vechicle for a one man tour-de-force does not always translate into the perfect movie.<br /><br />Not that this isn't a good film, it just isn't as good as Will Smith. Yes, the film is based on a true, inspirational story and Will's real life son Jaden, playing his on screen son is adorable. There are also numerous enjoyable performances by the supporting cast, specially the homeless guy (John Robb) looking for a time machine. Product values are superior throughout and the storyline possesses both depth and character. The problem is that Chris Gardner's (Will Smith) personal crisis goes on too long and by the time things are finally turning positive the film abruptly ends and the audience is denied the opportunity to sit back for a moment and relish the emotional high from his accomplishment.<br /><br />A good film, definitely something you should see. Repeatability factor? Once is enough for me. My rating 3 ? Stars.</p></body></html>

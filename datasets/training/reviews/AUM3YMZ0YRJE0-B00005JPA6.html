<meta name="summary" content="reality delivered through fantasy:  a wonderful and sad masterpiece"></head><body><p>This is one of those films that you either love or hate:  its themes and vision are so strong that if you can't identify with the story or don't want a brutal journey, it will not be your bag.  This is not Disney fare, but a look into horror and the power of a child's imagination to cope with it.  The details contain such naked pain and the stark reality of human depravity, yet juxtaposed against an imaginative child's world that runs from, yet is coming to understand, it all.<br /><br />The child is taken to the home - besieged in the hills of Franquist Spain during WWII - of her step father.  He is a fascist and sociopath, with no love to give, and on a mission to crush the local resistance by any means necessary - and I mean any means.  She sees him for what he is, and as yet is as uncorrupted as her very sick mother is co-opted.  They are brought into this environment in order for the step father to witness the birth of his son, in spite of all the dangers.  The child translates this reality into a parallel fairy tale, but it is less an escape than a recognition of the full situation.<br /><br />As the plot unfolds, she is called to accomplish a number of tasks to reclaim her place in a magical world.  As reviewers have noted, the juxtaposition is brilliantly executed.  Indeed, the characters from both worlds are so vivid that this may be one of the best fantasy films I have ever seen.<br /><br />The story is moving in its realism, with unbearable glimpses of physical and emotional pain, graphically displayed and extremely sad, with all the wonder that lovers of history and human potential can feel.  I was stunned and riveted  to the point of weeping.<br /><br />This is not for children, but a truly dark exploration of who we are and what we are capable of.  Recommended - it is the most vivid fantasy, anchored in an utterly un-hollywood reality.</p></body></html>

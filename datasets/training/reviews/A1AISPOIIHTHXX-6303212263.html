<meta name="summary" content="One of the best comic book movies period"></head><body><p>What usually happens for me is that if I've been exposed for one particular stage of pop culture for a long period of time, everything else seems kind of "off". Take for instance old country music: my grandparents/parents love it but I can't stand it. So when you take Superman, in which I've watched the animated series and 5 1/2 seasons worth of Smallville, anything else might not have that same luster. Like when I see this Lex Luthor, I always instead imagine Michael Rosenbaum, or Dana Delany doing the voice for Lois Lane. However, it's still a great film that was before my time but came out at the perfect time.<br /><br />In case you've been living on Mars in a deep hole with metal music in your headphones, the story of Superman is the last son of the planet Krypton who arrives on the planet Earth. Capable of incredible powers, he decides to fight for good and stand against those wanting to cause harm or rule the planet, either/or. And so it is with Superman the movie, the same basic story but just up on the big screen.<br /><br />This is a 1970's film so some images look very outdated. Certain flying shots in particular have an obvious pasted look to them but that's ok, since 1) this is the 70's and 2) you just don't care. One fault I did find though: whether it was my DVD player, the film itself but one of the chapters got a little ugly(for me it was the pilots on Air Force One talking about Superman), it got a little pixel-y. However, considering it is an older film, it's quite something to see the film restored.<br /><br />My favorite Lex is probably Clancy Brown from the Animated Series or Michael Rosenbaum from Smallville. Here, Gene Hackman does an admirable job but there wasn't much of a threat there, he just seemed there to give something important to Superman to do. Dana Delany and Erica Durance are probably the hottest Lois Lane's but Margot Kidder is good in the role. Believable without being damsel in distress throughout the whole thing. It's up for debate whether Marlon Brandon earned his 3 million paycheck(some say 10) since he's only in here for under 10 minutes but oh well he looks good as Jor-El. It's funny seeing him mispronounce names though(it's Kryp-TON not Kryptin).<br /><br />And of course we come down to the Man: Christopher Reeve. Largely unknown at the time(much like upcoming Brandon Routh in Superman Returns), he embodies the character, bumbling and nervous as Clark Kent and confident and likable as our main hero. He even makes a scene work when late in the film Superman does a silly time rewind but the anger he displays makes up for it. Even in the lackluster sequels he still brings his A game which is quite something.<br /><br />Da da da DA da, da da da DA da....it's hard not to finish watching Superman and not hum the main theme. It gives the opening credits a nice big epic atmosphere even though the dumb names keep going! It felt like one of the longest opening credits I've ever seen, or at least that's how it felt but the opening theme as well as the rest of the film is especially great from John Williams in a rare non-Spielberg film score.<br /><br />Personally I hate Warner snap cases and this film really should've been on a big 2 disc release instead of a flipper but oh well we get a great film and that's what matters in the end. Now let's see how the new one does.</p></body></html>

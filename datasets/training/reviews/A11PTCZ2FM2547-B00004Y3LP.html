I had fun when I first saw this Spielberg offering in the theater, and I have grand fun every time I catch it on cable.  I have an eclectic DVD collection, and this movie needs to be a part of it, so there will be a parting with my coin in the near future.  Outside of the suspense, the sheer terror of running for your life from a T-Rex or a raptor, it was, and still is, the (then) state-of-the-art CGI effects that make this thriller so special.  And I still get goose bumps every time I see that puddle of water shake from the approaching steps of a mean-tempered predator.<br /><br />The cast is exceptional, but I especially enjoy Jeff Goldblum as a free-spirited science ethicist; his one-liners and zingers are priceless.  Wayne Knight is the rotund villain we all love to hate, and who isn't entertained by a chain-smoking Samuel L. Jackson pecking away on a keyboard?  Yes, the cast is stellar, but the dinosaurs steal this movie, gobbling up (pardon the pun) every scene they're in.  The effects are as terrifying as they are believable, even after all these years and subsequent technological enhancements; who knew hiding in a kitchen from two determined raptors could produce such white knuckle effects?  Four stars, however, instead of five; with the exception of the ongoing disillusion of Park founder John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) none of the other characters are fully vetted and fleshed out--including the leading roles, played by Sam Neill and Laura Dern (wolf howl).  Yet I'm being picky; in JURASSIC PARK, why should a character be fleshed out when they already have their real flesh at risk?<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></body></html>

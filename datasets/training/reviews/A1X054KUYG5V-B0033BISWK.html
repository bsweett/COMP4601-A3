<meta name="summary" content="Very good until the third act collapse"></head><body><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />District 9 does a lot of things right and offers some compelling science-fiction entertainment, so I'm able to forgive the fact that in the last half hour all ideas are thrown out the window in favor of nonstop action and poor characterizations (e.g. the Nigerians who show up so we can have another villain in the film); it's an intriguing film and at times a powerful one, but it could have been so much more.<br /><br />3/4</p></body></html>

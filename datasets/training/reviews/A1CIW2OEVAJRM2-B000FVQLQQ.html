<meta name="summary" content="When truth is more powerful than fiction."></head><body><p>Based on Sylvia Nasar's biography of the mathematical genius John Forbes Nash (born 1928), winner of the 1994 Nobel Prize in economics for his revolutionary game theory, `A Beautiful Mind' recounts Nash's struggle with genius and with schizophrenia.  Frequently and incorrectly confused with multiple personality disorder, schizophrenia involves seeing delusions.  In real life the nature of Nash's delusions during his time of illness have been largely forgotten by him, and in this regard the screen-writer has taken the liberty to fictionally recreate delusions revolving around three imagined characters: a representative of the US Defence who convinces Nash to act as a code-breaker by examining popular magazines for hidden Russian codes giving clues about an imminent nuclear attack, an imagined college room mate and his young orphaned niece.<br /><br />But the real power of this movie is that it enables viewers to get inside the mind of a schizophreniac by making these delusions real and presenting them as an alternate reality.  Nash's inner landscapes are presented as real to the audience, just as they are real to those with schizophrenia, and we are drawn convincingly into his world.  Suddenly, the plot takes an abrupt turn as both movie viewers and Nash are robbed of these delusions by having the rug pulled from under them and confronted with reality.  For Nash the experience is even more terrifying - he ends up in a psychiatric hospital.  To say more would spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, but it's enough to say that the experience of the movie is like the experience of the disease.  It's a brilliant concept that successfully enables us to empathize with Nash.  "Imagine that you would suddenly have learned the peoples and places and moments most important to you were not gone, not dead, but worse, had never been."  The movie's success is enhanced by the brilliant acting of Russell Crowe as John Nash, in a performance of pathos in the same category of the memorable acting of Rainman and Forrest Gump; and a delightful soundtrack by James Horner with haunting vocals by Charlotte Church.<br /><br />But this movie is just as much the story of Nash's wife Alicia (in an award winning performance by Jennifer Connelly) as it is about Nash.  Despite his mental problems, she sticks by him and her love and commitment to him says a great deal about what marriage is really all about. Nash's words in the acceptance speech of his Nobel Prize point to her love as the real source of his endurance in the struggle, and it is her love that this movie is about just as much as it is about Nash's genius and illness.  This positive portrayal of marriage and of the undying love of a wife is a welcome change from the typical infidelity offered by Hollywood.  Her love is just as beautiful as Nash's mind.<br /><br />Parents should be aware that there are some incidents of blasphemy and sexual talk.  But the themes of this movie in dealing with the complexity of schizophrenia are clearly adult anyway.  Not only does it result in greater appreciation for John Nash, but also greater understanding and compassion for schizophrenia - even if the portrayal of Nash's life is not entirely accurate.  There are moral and historical flaws, but there's still tremendous beauty.  `A Beautiful Mind' is a beautiful film that was deservedly rewarded for its beauty with several Oscars (including Best Picture), and if you're a fan of serious movies your life will be enhanced by viewing it.  If only more films had this kind of beauty. -GODLY GADFLY</p></body></html>

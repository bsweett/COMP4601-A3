<meta name="summary" content="It's so easy but: this movie is quite incredible"></head><body><p>At a time where a lot of comic book movies are coming out based on actual comic books, in comes the Incredibles to show the other filmmakers how it's done. Constantine was really disappointing, Elektra was funny but not in a good way and Daredevil just didn't feel right. In comes Brad Bird, well known for the vastly underrated Iron Giant, he comes and completely thrills while still having it nice enough for the kiddies.<br /><br />Bob Parr was at the top of his game. He was formally known as Mr. Incredible whose special powers was incredible(ugh, I wanted to go through this review without using that word) strength. He also is married to Helen, or Elastigirl in the old days. However, in typical fashion, or probably in typical American fashion, Mr. Incredible is sued for people not wanting to be saved or from suffering injuries. So in the end, all the supers are sued and are forced into hiding, masquerading as regular people.<br /><br />Bob, 15 years since his glory days, is now a claims worker for an insurance company while Helen is a housewife. He finds life rather mundane since he can't relive his glory days. In comes Mirage, a woman who would like to hire him and do some superhero stuff. He agrees, not telling his wife and does some superhero work with his wife none the wiser. However, he's tricked by his employer and stranded on the employer's island. So Helen and their 2 kids, Dash and Violet have to go in and help Dad.<br /><br />One thing I like is that it is a kids movie with animation from a company that does kid movies but yet it's got more suspense and big action sequences then the last Spiderman. One scene, the "100 meter Dash" has Pixar calls it, is quite a scene to watch. Even the humor is there, while not being full of witty puns like previous films, it does have it's nice moments, like when Edna, a superhero costume maker regales Helen of the superheroes whose lives were cut short just because of a cape.<br /><br />The voices are quite nice. Craig T. Nelson("Coach")has a way to be a calm presense one scene than start going off. And Holly Hunter's probably the coolest mom on screen although her explanations of why Dash can't go into sports seems a bit TOO overprotective. And Jason Lee, largely known for his roles in the Jay and Silent Bob films actually does a good job as villain Syndrome. Definite highlight is writer/director Brad Bird doing a nice job as Edna Mode, a nice little Edith Mead echo, a big costume designer from the old era.<br /><br />There's one thing that I'm a little disappointed in and oddly it has nothing to do with the film. It's the extras. There's a cute little short that explains why the babysitter Kari was so frantic on the phone about baby Jack-Jack. It has really weak outtakes that just looks plain silly and nowhere near what they did for previous films. And the making of is nice but it's almost kind of superflous or surface skimming. They don't even go much into detail about the voice actors or the 100 meter dash in designing. But there is a nice feature on the Character Designs, the Extra characters, the Sets but they don't go into as much detail as you'd want them too like in the Bug's Life extras.<br /><br />However, it is quite a film to watch and not a typical "I'm only watching this for the kids" movie, you'll probably find it awesome too.</p></body></html>

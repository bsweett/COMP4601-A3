AND I'LL TELL YOU THIS, THIS IS AN AWFULLY GOOD MOVIE! IN THIS ONE, AMNESIAC ASSASIN JASON BOURNE [MATT DAMON] COMES OUT OF RETIREMENT TO GO UP AGAINST A RUSSIAN HIT MAN WHO'S FRAMED HIM FOR MURDER. FULL OF SUSPENSE, HAS A LOTTA GREAT CAR CHASES, AND THE CHARACTERS ARE BELIEVABLE [WHICH IS RARE IN AN ACTION FLICK]. IF YOU WANT TO SEE A GOOD MOVIE, GET DOWN TO YOUR LOCAL THEATRE AND CHECK THIS OUT NOW!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ratatouille (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)"></head><body><p>Ratatouille (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo) is an amazing animated movie from the Walt Disney Pictures. The basic storyline is about a rat who has a dream to become a great chef. On his journey to become a great chef he meets the hapless kitchen-boy Linguini and the adventure begins. The animation is fantastic and the music is right on. The new short animated extra is hilarious and also educational at the same time. I love it. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.</p></body></html>

The man is magnificent!<br /><br />Yeah, we never got to see the true acting possibilites, Bloom always playing second rate roles, never a primary actor. But he really can hold scenes well by the strength of his acting. And this movie proves it.<br /><br />Kingdom of heaven is a wonderfully done movie by Ridley Scott (Gladiator) the history is pretty much accurate, and jerusalim is breathtaking...and huge. Some of the fighting scenes look like they could have been a cut off from LOTR, but then so did Troy. Not to say they wheren't awesome, but the part where Orlando leads his small band of horsemen into Saladin's army is a definate throwback to the scene in Return of the King, where Viggio leads his party into the circuling orcs at the gate into mordor...but I regress.<br /><br />Bloom comes back looking like he did in the Pirates of the Caribbean, a little more mature and handsome, but long hair and scruffy look just the same. Alan Rickman (Hitchiker,Dragonheart)is here also, as the crusader bent on following god and the king. His scenes aren't long, but what he does have shines.<br /><br />However, don't go looking to watch this movie as being light entertanment. For those who have watched Gladiator this is pretty much the same. Lots of head slashing, blood and neck cutting. Doesn't get much realistic then this. Besides, its enough just keeping up with the history portrayed in this movie to keep you focused. Otherwise you'll miss alot.<br /><br />Truly enjoyable, a real feast for the history buff and those that love good movies</p></body></html>

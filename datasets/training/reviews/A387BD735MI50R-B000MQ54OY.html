It's a sort of re-telling of the "Jonathan Livingston Seagull" parable that was so popular a generation ago. Jonathan learned to soar in mystic solitude while his peers were still limiting themselves to clumped shoreline scavengering. Here Mumbles, a non-conforming penguin, persists in dancing while all his peers are still expressing their heart-songs literally, by singing. Both works are celebrations of doing your own thing, of following your unique passion.<br /><br />But the producers of "Happy Feet" made a few odd choices along the way. First of all, it was odd to have animated penguins doing the dancing. Penguins have such short feet, buried in their paunches, that it's difficult to see and appreciate their foot action. I wonder if perhaps the success of the nature documentary "March of the Penguins" influenced this choice. Since that documentary made penguins a hot ticket, the producers might have decided to ride the crest of penguin popularity and feature them regardless. I'm not sure of the respective chronology of the two pictures though.<br /><br />Then the score here isn't particularly inspired. A lot of the music is determinedly modern, and therefore not necessarily the most melodic or spirited.<br /><br />Finally, I thought for a while there that we were sailing into some serious ethnic stereotyping. When Mumbles is catapulted into another community of penguins, it's obvious these others are being voiced by Robin Williams and others almost as caricatures of Hispanic and African-Americans.<br /><br />First it's Ramon and his barrio buddies who come forward to greet the newcomer and to take him under their wings. Like typical boys from the hood, they spurn honest work and the business of preparing to be legitimate fathers by assembling pebble nests. Instead they are out cruising for "chicas" on their charm and machismo alone.<br /><br />Next Mumbles works his way in among a revivalist congregation led by Lovelace, an obvious parody of a Baptist preacher who is using his pulpit fervors simply as a way of gulling the ladies back into his chambers afterwards. I really wondered why there hadn't been some picketing objections to "Happy Feet," considering this parade of negative racial stereotypes.<br /><br />But then I began to get past taking offense, past political correctness. I even began to like Lovelace. He becomes a more sympathetic character when he's reduced to seeking Mumbles' help tracking the real source of the sacred pendant he's been claiming was bestowed on him by some higher powers. We viewers can see that Lovelace's talisman is pitifully only a plastic pop bottle ring that he's gotten around his neck and that is now choking him to death him as a result of the expansion he's undergone from his congregation's tributes. His plight sends Mumbles and his new band of comrades on an ecological mission that rushes to too much of an abrupt conclusion - as if the scriptwriter suddenly just wanted to go home. This was particularly disappointing since I had begun to enjoy the company of all these home boys so much.<br /><br />So when Ramon, with all his irrepressible stocky cockiness, beckons and commands, "Come over here, Fuzzy. Let me tell dju someting" - I lean down, ready to listen and follow.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bland, dull edged satire"></head><body><p>This has been described as a "razor sharp" satire. It isn't. The main character is a tobacco company lobbyist who defends tobacco interests. The problem here is that we knew that these guys were weasels over forty years ago - this is hardly cutting edge material. Many, many obvious jabs at this type are made. This film will only be an eye opener to someone who has been in a coma for the last few decades. The ending, where the lead character feels some moral responsibility toward his son is phony. The movie spends most of its running time showing us how utterly amoral the character is. Are we really supposed to believe that he suddenly feels remorse because of his son? More likely (and I know this type), he would keep his son in the dark about the true nature of his work. Katie Holmes looks horrible here. She can't act, has bad skin, and seems badly miscast as the "hot" reporter who seduces the handsome Eckhart (you would think that the gorgeous Eckhart would have women lined up but he seems so desperate that he has to settle for the odd looking Holmes).</p></body></html>

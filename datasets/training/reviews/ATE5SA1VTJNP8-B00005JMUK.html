<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant Performances!"></head><body><p>About half-way through, I wasn't sure if this was really all that it had been cracked up to be, but rest assured, after viewing it in its entirety, it certainly is worthy of the praise that it has recieved.<br /><br /> Having studied Aileen Wournos a bit in school, I came to the conclusion that she was a sick piece of trash, conjured up from some sewer. This film did not change my opinion of her, but it did succeed, however in painting a poignant picture of a human being transforming into a complete monster. To some it may seem that the makers of this are trying to convince the viewer that Wournos was a victim of circumstance, had no choice, but I don't think that is the case. The facts concerning Aileen's rampage of terror are portrayed with accuracy, her personality is captured by the brilliant Charlize Therzon. It is as if the viewer were a member of the jury, walking along with Aileen, being presented with the story firsthand, without the lawyers bickering back and forth, and not having to worry about undue sympathy being evoked.<br /><br /> If this movie had been some feminist war-cry, then I, being the sentimental sucker that I am, most likely would have been convinced that Ailleen was misunderstood, etc. But that was not the case. I think that monster got exactly what she deserved (along with her first victim). To sum it up: Great Film!</p></body></html>

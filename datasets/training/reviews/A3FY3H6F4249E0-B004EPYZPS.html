<meta name="summary" content="Good Sci-Fi"></head><body><p>This is a good sci-fi movie, about some teenagers making a zombie movie when a huge train accident occurs and these little white cubes get thrown around everywhere.  Next thing you know, the U.S. Air Force is grabbing up everything.  Is there something they want to hide??? (Hint--could be!)  "Do not speak of this, or they will KILL you. . . and your parents!"<br /><br />A Stephen Spielberg production, filmed in West Virginia.  Don't forget to watch the credits at the end for a little extra show.</p></body></html>

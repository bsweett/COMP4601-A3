BUT, NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE TELL YOU IF IT IS WORTH UPGRADING FROM YOUR REGULAR DVD TO BLU-RAY. THIS ONE IS WORTH IT, BUT THE UPGRADE OF A REGULAR DVD ON A GOOD BLU-RAY PLAYER IS ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE BLU-RAY VERSION ON THIS MOVIE, MAYBE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF STUNNING COLORS. BLACK COLORS ARE CLEAR AND IT SOUNDS GREAT.</p></body></html>

I'll admit that. And I've never been much of a fan of Bryan Singer. I think he's a middling director, and a second-rate storyteller. Superman Returns did nothing to disabuse me of either notion. But I really wanted to like this movie. The trailers were intriguing. Stopping a bullet with your eye? How cool is that?  It suggested a spark of originality, of pushing the envelope. But when the movie starts sluggishly and gives us our first glimpse of the young Superman running and leaping a la the first Spiderman movie--so patent was the rip-off, it made me shake my head in disbelief--it becomes apparent that there's little hope.<br /><br />Brandon Routh brings a naive charm to the role of Superman. No great shakes, but he's the best of the bunch. Kevin Spacey? Wasted -- plus he doesn't bring the sick fun to the role that I expected. Granted, with those ridiculous lines, he started at a great disadvantage. Kate Bosworth is pretty enough, but most of her tears -- and there are too many -- seem eyedropped in.  James Marsden? Eh. Parker Posey? A low-rent Valerie Perrine. The kid? He looks like a young, anemic McCauley Culkin, and that about sums up his performance.<br /><br />And as this Mulligan Stew of a movie plods on and on, this way and that, we do get some impressive special effects. The flying is very realistic and thrilling. But for every impressive effect, there are bad ones, too.  In a number of scenes, Superman looks fake -- the helicopters look fake -- the buildings look fake. If this is what you get for effects in a $225 million film, someone ought to sue the special effects company for overbilling.<br /><br />It's worth mentioning, too, the overbearing analogies to the story of Jesus. Yeah, yeah. We know Jor-El sent his only begotten son, blah, blah, blah, but the scene in the hospital, when we see the bed empty ... too much.<br /><br />Watch box office plummet as word of this weary -- and stupefying  -- movie spreads.<br /><br />The trailer for Spider-man 3 was the best part of this film. Here's waiting for next May and an exciting super-hero film.</p></body></html>

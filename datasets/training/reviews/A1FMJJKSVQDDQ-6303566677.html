<meta name="summary" content="Creepier than the sequel"></head><body><p>Although I still prefer "Judgement Day", the first Terminator contains a darker atmosphere that I really like. Filmed in a much lower budget, "The Terminator" is darker, creepier, and bloodier than the sequel. Schwarzenegger portrays a killing machine from the future who is sent to the present in order to kill the unborn future leader of the human rebellion. Linda Hamilton plays Sarah Connor, the young woman who tries hard to disbelieve that fact that she will, in the future, give birth to the future's only hope against artificial intelligence. Michael Beihn is Kyle, who is sent to stop the Terminator from killing Sarah.<br /><br />This is an awesome film, and while I do love the sequel much more than the original, I love this one for its dark and chilling atmosphere.

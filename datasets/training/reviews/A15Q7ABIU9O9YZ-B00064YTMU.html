<meta name="summary" content="OK. Let's take a deep breath here now, folks."></head><body><p>One of the ways we get hooked into movies is the "this could happen" feeling. Even when Ridley faces The Alien, if we've been brought along carefully, we say 'this could happen.'<br /><br />Of course nothing we see in Hollywood really could happen, Aliens and hitmen notwithstanding, so when the well coiffed, highly intelligent, money to burn assassin Vincent has been assigned to murder 5 key witnesses to the Federal trial of a billionaire drug lord, that "this COULDN'T happen" feeling starts to rise for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />You probably think with money to burn, a Joseph Aboud suit, and a $10,000 laptop in hand, why would the intelligent hitman get into a Los Angeles cab? Well, yeah, that's a problem for me. But the real problem is  . . . .the trial is TOMORROW. Vincent is going to wait 12 hours before opening statement to kill off the evidence? Why are the witnesses not in protective custody instead of making a pizza in a two bedroom flat in Venice, making out with two hot women in a West LA penthouses, and rocking 'n rolling in a club Beverly Hills THE NIGHT BEFORE A FEDERAL TRIAL? What if Jaime Foxx didn't speak English? What if they got a flat tire, a back-up on the 405 or LA smog?<br /><br />Having said that, Cruise is brilliant as the intelligent hitman, and Foxx as the bright but procrastinating cabbie. Jada Pinkett-Smith is absolutely gorgeous and plays a nice supporting role. The photography nearly steals the show, very slick like the Miami Vice days and always present as both a scene setter and conversationalist. But the movie lacks that sinister evil of To Live and Die, Body Heat and the much earlier Bullit, and seems confused as to whether it wants to be a slick shoot 'em up mystery or a series of "My Dinner with Andre" conversations between Vincent and Max.<br /><br />Kudos to Cruise and Foxx who do a nice morphing of the other's best characteristics, Vincent showing a hint of introspection and compassion at the end and Max more decisiveness. 4 stars.

We laugh at all of the stereotypes of the high school class system.<p>The Brain<br />The Criminal<br />The Athlete<br />The Princess<br />The Basket Case<p>Admittedly, there is an element of self-analysis when anyone watches this movie.  You really can't help but place yourself into one of those stereotypical roles and gaze at your own frailties.  However, it all wraps up cleanly because people are people and we really aren't that different.  How poignant that it takes an 8 hour Saturday detention to enlighten the souls of these five kids.<p>You must own all John Hughes movies.</p></body></html>

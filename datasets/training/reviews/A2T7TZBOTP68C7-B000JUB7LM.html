But she has raw talent, put to good use in Million Dollar Baby.<br /><br />Swank is so perfect for the role of Maggie Fitzgerald, an over-thirty wanna-be boxer.  Maggie is alone in the world, without a penny to her name.  She comes from a white trash background.  Maggie is set on getting Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) to train her.  Dunn is aghast at the idea of training a GIRL.  But Dunn has many sad things troubling him.  His only friends are Scrap (Morgan Freeman) and Father Horvak, a priest who is so irritated by Dunn's irreverence that he cusses like a sailor.<br /><br />The settings of the film are dreary, dingy, depressing, and grimy.  The story is awash in hopelessness; that is what makes Million Dollar Baby seem grim.  Million Dollar Baby is a bit depressing and over the top in some places. You can't honestly believe Maggie's mother and family would be THAT bad.  They are almost caricatures of themselves, not really believable.  But if you look under the surface, you will see that some hope lingers in the hearts of Scrap and Maggie.  Ultimately, a spark is fired in Dunn.  Will the spark last?  That is a turning point in the film, which makes it a rare film of unusual quality.  I have not seen a film with such non-showy integrity since Slingblade.</p></body></html>

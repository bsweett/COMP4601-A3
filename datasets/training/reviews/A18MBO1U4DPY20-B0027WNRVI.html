<meta name="summary" content="Made Me Go Weak With its Colossal Boredom"></head><body><p>Me and my four friends saw this movie at a theater cause we thought we'd see some action. We did see some action but the fact that this movie made me sleep with its absolutely non engrossing script made me feel I wasted my good money(and time) on something as small as this.<br /><br />I call it small because I fail to recollect one action sequence , one dialogue or one thing from this movie that I liked to the extent of saying it was better movie'd(my term) than some other.<br /><br />Please see: I felt quite disturbed at the money wasted on making this film. There are people who liked this and I respect them for it. But if there are some people as foolish as me who chose to go for this instead of some other hollywood flick STOP! I'd recommend any of the following movies instead of this sad tale of boredom. KING ARTHUR , TROY , Lord Of The Rings Two Towers...<br /><br />So Long , lovers :)</p></body></html>

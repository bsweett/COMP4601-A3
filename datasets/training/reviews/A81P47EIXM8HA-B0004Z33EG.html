<meta name="summary" content="LAMO "Ultimate?" edition..BUT the commentary is great"></head><body><p>the fellow before me wrote an amazing review of this "Ultimate" Edition? ....it has less going for it than the previous edition...by a long shot...BUT , Stallone's commentary is worth it...sadly any hard core fan of the movie will need BOTH editions.  Why can't these folks treat us right?  ...i had a feeling I shouldn't get rid of my current special editions of these movies when I saw the ULTIMATE editions coming out...and thankfully i didn't...the previous editions are SUPERIOR with many wonderful bonus features...these META scope etc etc..SUCK and would annoy a child.....much less an adult.</p></body></html>

I'm glad that I just rented it because that's all it is good for is a watch.  The only part that meant anything to me was the ending.  The rest of the movie was quite bland.  I do have to say there was nice casting here, but it's such a shame that they were wasted on this movie.  As for the DVD extras, there was a lot of boring stuff.  I went to the menu, then quickly got out of it.  If you decide to watch this, rent it because I think 20.00 is steep for a movie like this.</p></body></html>

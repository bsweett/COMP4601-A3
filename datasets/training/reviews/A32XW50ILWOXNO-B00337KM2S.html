That doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad film but, considering it'd like to woo audiences into a kind of back-patting "smart" sentimentality, it certainly can't qualify as a great one.<br /><br />At virtually every key moment when he could draw the audience closer, director Jason Reitman pulls away for a zing, or to regard his actors, particularly George Clooney, from a pitying, judgmental distance. Exceedingly well-paced for most of its running time - and deft for all its moving parts - its flaws are exposed in the last 15 minutes, which drenches Clooney with one bucket of cold water after another as if to say "You see? Feel it!" There's something indecent about a comedy doing that, self-defeating. "Up In the Air" appears to resent its smile, which is to say it doesn't really have one.<br /><br />The premise veers toward satire without telegraphing its trajectory: Clooney is Ryan Bingham, a corporate samurai who fires people when companies don't feel like it. In the role, Ryan's a method actor, capably (and somewhat inexplicably) adjusting his persona to the newly axed sitting across the desk from him. Clooney is smooth in those scenes, canny and clever. We smile in the midst of misery; it's secretly fun to watch someone good at what they do. A murderer. A thief. A hatchet man.<br /><br />Believable? Borderline. But Ryan's "personal touch" is juxtaposed with new sidekick Natalie (Anna Kendrick), fresh out of college with the notion of firing people over the Internet - which means Ryan will be grounded, strapped to a headset, and stuck in a cubicle. Given the timing of "Up In The Air," and the economic meltdown that transpired in 2008, Natalie's "corporate concept," predictably debunked in the field, is ludicrous, for one. A "postal" invitation, for two.<br /><br />Ryan likes his life. He spends 320 days a year on the road. He enjoys an elite level of service in every airport, hotel and Hertz he enters. He's cultivated side career as motivational speaker, where he appeals to rooms of "warriors" like him to limit their lives to a backpack. No family. No entanglements. His parents are dead. His sisters are out of sight and mind in Wisconsin.<br /><br />But female fellow-warrior Alex (Vera Farmiga) provides a complication: Seemingly unburdened like Ryan, she purrs his way into his bed with the right mix of seduction and sass; Natalie pushes Ryan further toward love by projecting her own wishes for a relationship onto Alex.<br /><br />Ostensibly a film about a new, cold-hearted American economy - and, by extension, the world - the movie is actually an excoriation of the admittedly lemon-headed values of the Eighties and its offspring, the late Aughties, as children of the Reagan-era yuppie couples stride boldly - and somewhat foolishly - into the world, expecting it to shrink down to oyster size upon command, or, at the very least, the purchase of the appropriate technology and furniture. Natalie, played as a insufferable prig by Kendrick, quickly gets her wake-up call. Ryan's comeuppance marinates for the movie's running time and serves as a stunning detour to the predicted story arc.<br /><br />These penalties are fine, I suppose, but what's the moral here? Work shouldn't be important? If so, why the proverbial violin scenes where Ryan and Natalie 86 blubbering, pleading employees? Is sobriety the aim? Sadness? Pointed resignation to the world at hand?<br /><br />I don't think "Up In the Air" ever tries to figure itself out. Like Ryan, it lives in the moment, enjoying its overhead shots of various cities without minding the meaning. Consider that, in a key moment, we're meant to laugh at a lame engagement ring designed by the fiancee (Danny McBride) of Ryan's younger sister (Melanie Lynsky). The McBride character is a retread of Dermot Mulroney's idiot in "About Schmidt." Why is he a dope? Why is it funny that he's a dope, in a movie that makes pains to connect with "regular folks?" Why are small engagement rings funny? People lose their jobs - but the size of diamond remains sacrosanct?<br /><br />Why are we shown scenes of Ryan lecturing sizable groups of "backpack warriors," and none of him actually mingling with them? Because it's a construct. Why are they there? Who would choose to attend such a seminar? Samurai warriors? The crudest scene involves a suicide that mostly serves as a double-downer to Ryan's personal journey. Reitman wants to score cheap emotional points late in the game to catch up with the gloss that precedes it.<br /><br />And the movie has gloss. It's terrifically made, its screenplay light and clever, juggling several plotlines - the road trip, the prodigal son, the caustic corporate rant, the bizarre quest of Ryan's to reach a certain number of airline miles - with speed and ease. The skill in "Up In the Air" trumps its emptiness in many ways; only in the movie's final act do you see the hustle begin to emerge, the sweet con of overturned, folded cards.<br /><br />Farmiga is excellent as the sharp, non-committal Alex. Farmiga is comfortable being inside cold, rough characters, and she nails most of the notes she's forced to play. But she also gets off easy, and once the plot turns, you'll know why a short phone call that ends with the line "I'm an adult" doesn't even begin to explain the decisions Alex makes. Clooney looks thin, old. He's still a nice guy as an actor, self-aware of his charm - and how it wears off, after a moment. Some critics don't care for his sheepish notes, but I like them.<br /><br />But Reitman doesn't make either Clooney or Farmiga - or Kendrick, who's awful on purpose - get messy with their emotions. The great directors know how to take a scene up to the beat, and then just past it, into a raw, furious scream of drama, delivered in caustic, brittle lines. Wilder knew how. Lumet still does. Woody Allen once did. The best Europeans have that talent. There is a moment in "Up In the Air" that begs for a showdown. Reitman misses it. A shame. It's a keystone to the film's flaw - that it's trapped in Movieland, without the sense to get out.</p></body></html>

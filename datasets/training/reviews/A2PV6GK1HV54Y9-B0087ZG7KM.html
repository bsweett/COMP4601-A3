Mostly movies that get a lot of attention like this one did during the summer; I tend to hate but Bridesmaids is one of the funniest films of 2011! Wiig is a freakin' genius at what she does and she also co-wrote this comedy as well. The scene on the airplane is priceless and I love how this film has some depth to it, Wiig's character Annie is someone you can't help but idenitfy with and root for. I love, love, love this movie! I highly recommend it, enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another David vs. Goliath"></head><body><p>Based on a true story, Erin Brockovich, a single mother of three takes on PG&amp;E to prove that they are poisoning the town's water supply.  She manages to get a job with a law firm run by Ed Masry (Albert Finney)just in time to break open the biggest direct action corporate lawsuit in american history.  After a lot of hard work, no family life, and insulting everyone in her path, she wins the victims $330 million dollars and herself a hefty two million dollar bonus.  The movie is not as much about the courtroom battle with PG&amp;E as it is with the battles that Erin was facing in everyday life, a single uneducated working class mother raising three kids on her own in a very uncooperative world.</p></body></html>

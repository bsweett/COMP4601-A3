<meta name="summary" content="TCM Remake is Average"></head><body><p>There's nothing special about this remake. &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; has all the right ingredients for a successful horror picture, but it blows it in the end. In the early 1070's, a group of young adults (including Jessica Biel) drive in the middle of nowhere. Then they almost run over a corpse walking on the road. The girl is mortified because 'they' tortured her. Ok, bam, she's done. The kids flip out and try to find a phone, but of course they're in the middle of nowhere and a big, ol' house is conveniently right there screaming, &quot;come in and die!&quot; Typically, the children walk into the house and all hell breaks loose. Leatherface's dungeon is leaking, that boy needs to have that fixed. Then a crooked sherriff (R. Lee Ermey, who doesn't belong in this movie) appears and wraps up the body and calls it a day. You know the kids get it one by one and Leatherface actually reveals his real face. Disappointing. The guy is a big oaf and he trips all over himself while chasing these poor kids. What a goof! The inept creature cut his own leg with that chainsaw. He should've known it wasn't a toy! Then there's this kid with really fake, buck teeth. Why was he in this movie? There was no point for a lot of the 'family' members and they weren't nearly as sadistic as the original family in the 1974 classic. A plus to this movie and I have to quote from the Amazon.com review: &quot;The camera lovingly photographs Biel's tank-topped bosom and sculpted abs as she's running in terror from a bloated, chainsaw-wielding, human-skin-wearing maniac.&quot; Even Richard Roeper pointed that out and gave the movie thumbs up. I remember other scenes where the girls are lying in the dirt, face first and they're coughing a lot because dirt was getting in their mouths. I thought that was funny! This movie had more laughs than scares and the ending was ridiculous. All and all, the movie will satisfy most horror movie buffs, but not highly intellectual people.</p></body></html>

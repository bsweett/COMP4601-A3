<meta name="summary" content="Good movie, great dialogue"></head><body><p>George Clooney has a tendency to pick movies with great dialogue and original storylines every year.  In 2009, it paid of with this drama that nabbed a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars.  The story background is about around a man whose professional life is traveling from company to company, where his job is to fire people.  The plot focuses on his life, and how it is complicated by a female colleague who is trying to change how he does his job.  There are numerous surprises throughout the movie, which is anchored by great dialogue from all the characters.  There is some romance, and some comedy.  Overall, a good movie, though I do not think it deserved a Best Picture nomination when other, better movies from 2009, such as Star Trek and Harry Potter, did not get a nod.</p></body></html>

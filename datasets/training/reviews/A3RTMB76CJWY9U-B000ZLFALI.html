Almost as though the Beatles had written the music for the movie, and not the other-way-around. Certainly what comes to my mind the most are numbers like "A Little Help From My Friends," "Revolution," and "Hey Jude."<br /><br />For each number, the film expertly crafts visual imagery and tone. Even some of the songs that I've never particularly liked, like Strawberry Fields Forever, become engaging and magical, here. This movie provides the viewer with a number of moments that will stay with you. The gigantic Uncle Sams in the induction center? The sexy nurses (all played by Salma Hayek, I believe) singing Happiness is a Warm Gun? The dead Vietnamese women singing the title song? Are images not likely to leave anytime soon.<br /><br />Setting the story in the late 60s, with a backdrop of student protests and war, is brilliant, too. Not only is it a great setting for a strong love story, but it ties into the times in which the Beatles were writing and lends a genuine feel to the whole project. I do not think that the Beatles would have been unhappy to see their music used so.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is more than a movie: it is a statement. An event. It takes incredible music, blends that with stunning visuals, and a fine story woven into a stirring, and appropriate, backdrop. In a word?<br /><br />Gorgeous.</p></body></html>

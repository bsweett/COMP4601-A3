<meta name="summary" content="A Great Way To End The Series!  I've enjoyed the ride!"></head><body><p>The entire Rocky series has been a great ride.  All of the Rocky films have been inspirational, entertaining, and of course a little predictable.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa is no exception, but this film has the same "rough" edges that made the first Rocky such a hit.<br /><br />Rocky is still back in Philadelphia, but now he owns an Italian restaurant (Adrian's) with Mexican cooks preparing the food.  The restaurant kind of becomes the focal point for a lot of what goes on in the film.  Well, that and Adrian's gravesite.  The scenes at both of these locations work well, and add a lot of realism to Stallone's sixth installment of the series.<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone and his films have always inspired me to believe in the impossible; I'm sure many people around the globe think the same.  He has been criticized for riding the success of the Rocky films, but I think the films are great.  I also consider Stallone a man who has lived a full life, giving his all to his work, his family, and himself.  He's made mistakes, but he has always accepted responsibility for his actions and moved on.<br /><br />Stallone had to have doubts about making Rocky Balboa.  But I noticed the people in the theater, especially the generation who grew up watching the Rocky films, seemed to be visiting a cast of old friends as they watched the film progress.<br /><br />The only part of the movie I thought could have been a lot better was the fight sequences between Rocky and Mason "The Line" Dixon (Antonio Tarver).  After all of the amazing boxing matches Rocky has been in, only a match between Rocky and Godzilla would have sufficed a true Rocky fan.<br /><br />The best parts of the film are every single scene with Geraldine Hughes (Marie).  She absolutely steals the show with every move she makes and every word she speaks.  Whether she is telling Rocky about her son, Steps (James Francis Kelly III) or giving Rocky a speech about why he should box the current champion (a crazy idea if you ask me), she is so believable that she deserves an academy award for almost single-handedly carrying this film into the Land of Possibility.  Geraldine Hughes is now my favorite actress!<br /><br />Rocky fans will also be happy with Paulie's (Burt Young) return to the big screen.  Age has not made Paulie anymore of an adult, and his dialogue throughout the film reminds us why we all first fell in love with this guy - as creepy as that sounds.<br /><br />Rocky Balboa is not as predictable as I thought it was going to be.  It has just enough things going on in the film to keep it interesting, just enough action scenes to get your blood pumping, and just enough romance to make you wonder if Rocky and Marie get married in the never-to-be-made Rocky 7 (Rocky and Marie Balboa).<br /><br />At the end of the movie, the people in the theater broke out in applause.  I think men and women appreciate the hard work Stallone has put into his Rocky films.  I think they were saying goodbye to their old friend - Rocky Balboa.<br /><br />And I think we are all going to miss him!<br /><br />Bye Rocky!  It has been a blast!<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></body></html>

The story is about Jack Parr, who used to be Mr. Incredible, a super-strong superhero.  But he was retired by the government, along with the rest of the superheroes, when our litigious-happy society got out of control, and the government could not afford to settle all the lawsuits against superheroes.  All the heroes were relocated, and told to just fit in with the rest of the populace, and to conceal their superpowers.<br /><br />And so our story begins.  Jack is married to the former Elastigirl (Holly Hunter).  They have three children: Dash, Violet, and Baby Jack-Jack.  Dash and Violet have superpowers, but are discouraged from using them.  Mom stays at home, while Dad has become an overweight, depressed insurance adjustor. The themes in this movie are very valid and very touching.  One theme is: why bend over backwards to make EVERYONE feel special - then no one will be.  Jack questions the importance of going to his son's "graduation" from fourth grade.<br /><br />The main theme is that life is empty without doing what you are meant to be doing.  Jack meets secretly with another superhero, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) to listen to the police scanner and to sneak in and help - unseen.  A mysterious woman offers Mr. Incredible a secret mission.  Seeking meaning in his life, Mr. I. seizes the opportunity, while keeping it from his wife.<br /><br />Superheroes are not the only ones languishing, and longing for the glory days.  Uber-designer Edna Mole longs to design costumes the way she used to.  When Jack comes to her to patch up his old suit, she designs a brand-new suit for him - and one for each member of his family, even though they are not practicing superheroes.<br /><br />Edna completely stole the show.  She has the funniest lines in the movie.</p></body></html>

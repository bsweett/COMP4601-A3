<meta name="summary" content="Not What I Expected"></head><body><p>I didn't see this film in the theater, so when I sat down to view The Break-Up I was surprised by the fact that it's less of a romantic comedy than a romantic drama.  Sure there are some funny moments, but at its heart the film is about the relationship of Gary Grobowski and Brooke Meyers (played wonderfully by Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston) and how it explodes into a great mess. Vince Vaughn is great as the selfish Gary who doesn't understand why people just can't fall in line and do what he wants them to do.  As his girlfriend, Brooke, Aniston shows some real acting chops and plays a character much more adult and well-rounded than Rachel from Friends.  While the film focuses mostly on the characters of Gary and Brooke, the supporting cast is also top-notch.  Two that really shine in the film are Jon Favreau as Gary's best friend and Vincent D'Onofrio as Gary's older brother, Dennis, who gets no respect from self-centered Gary.  There is one scene in particular between them that was just heart-wrenching.  As I said, this film was not what I expected it to be.  After something like The Wedding Crashers, I guess I was expecting a bit more slapstick and childish humor from a Vaughn film, but that is definitely not what The Break-Up is; in fact, it's a very adult film about two people who can't seem to communicate with each other until it's too late.  I especially like that the writers didn't sell out in the end and go for the hokey finale.  Very good film.</p></body></html>

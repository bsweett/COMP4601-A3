<meta name="summary" content="Too over the top, the series got old"></head><body><p>The first one was good, the second one was the best, by part three, it just got old.<br /><br />Austin Powers returns for his third movie, this time going after Goldmember, rescuing his father, hooking up with Foxy Cleopatra, and ends with a huge family reunion that hasn't been done since Star Wars' Return of the Jedi.<br /><br />This movie had a few laughs, but seriously this was just getting repetetive. Plus Goldmember was an absolutly terrible character. The skin eating was just stupid. Dr. Evil does a cool rap in the prison with Mini-me, but the song he did in part two was way better. It seems everything in part two was better. Fat Bastard, Mini-me, and even Austin himself. I know this was a great proiject for Mike Myers, but even he should know that after this trilogy it's time to hang up the ruffles for good.<br /><br />If you have one and two, of course you;ll get this to complete the set, but I think it is the worst of the three. It depended too much on cameos it seems to get the big belly laughs. Of course I'll admit that watching Britney Spears explode may be the best scene in all three movies.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a TIM BURTON film... need I say more?"></head><body><p>Tim Burton has created the best mix of fantasy and drama that Hollywood has ever seen. Burton mostly known for his fantasy side directs with his usual brilliance. Although my loyalty lies with "Beetlejuice" as my favorite Burton film, "Big Fish" is an excellent addition to Burton's list of some of the most magical motion pictures ever to come out of Hollywood. The cast is superb, the set decor is out of this world, and the story is a piece of mind blowing fiction. Last but not least I always have to mention the soundtracks of Burton's films. Composer Danny Elfman is phenomenal, his music scores always add so much to Tim Burton's films. BIG FISH was recommended to me by one of my Amazon.com friends (thanks), ..of course being that I see all of Tim Burton's movies in theaters I had already seen it. It's a masterpiece in every way, after watching it again today I was reminded of just how great it truly is. 5 stars = excellent.</p></body></html>

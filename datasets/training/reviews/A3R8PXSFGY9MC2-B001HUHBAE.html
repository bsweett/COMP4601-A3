<meta name="summary" content="Zodiac"></head><body><p>'Zodiac' is a good film that kept me interested for the whole duration, but with a slightly lack lustre ending. I know this is based on real events so the director was unable to spice the ending up too much, but I found the way it fizzled out and wrapped up the story with a few screens worth of writing at the end pretty poor pay off for well over 2 1/2 hours viewing. Saying that, this film is very atmospheric. It is excellently directed and the various actors do a top job in building suspense and keeping you hooked into the story. Some murder scenes early on are quite shocking and powerful without being excessively gratuitous, which is something in itself. Overall this is a good film, that should keep you watching, but don't expect too many plot twists or a shock ending to leave you with that feeling of satisfaction. A solid four stars.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

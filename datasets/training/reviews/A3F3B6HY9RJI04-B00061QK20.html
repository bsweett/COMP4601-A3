The emperor doubts the original story the hero gives and gives his own interpretation of how events unfolded.  The hero then retells the correct story.<br /><br />In other words, the story is told three times.  While this sounds like it Groundhogs Day reincarnated, it is far from that in that each version is completely different from each other and doesn't have you sitting there going, "Oh, no, not again."  The story grabs you and keeps you interested.  In fact, at the end of the movie I found myself wishing for more.<br /><br />As with similar movies in this genre; Hidden Tiger, Couching Dragon and Iron Monkey; the martial arts in this movie is phenomenal... though some of it is rather comical.<br /><br />If you liked movies like the ones just listed you will find yourself loving this movie.  I think this one is even better because you've got the story telling imagination of Quentin Tarantino to help things along.  Highly recommended even if you aren't into martial arts because of the excellent story that is told.</p></body></html>

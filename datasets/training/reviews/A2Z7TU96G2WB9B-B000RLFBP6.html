<meta name="summary" content="Good, solid science fiction"></head><body><p>A good science-fiction film does not have to be pure escapism.  A good science-fiction film doesn't have to create new worlds about which we dream.  Instead, good sci-fi takes what is scientifically possible and takes our world to the next step.  Watching this film again after many years, I see that it still stands to the test of time.<p>Peter Weller is Robocop just as Robocop is Officer Murphy.  We know that they are separate entities, but we can not look at one without thinking of the other.  This is one of the main premises of the movie, what makes us who we are.  Robocop is told that he is simply Robocop and is given his order, but he finds that his identity is not dependent on the mechanical body or the feelings.  <p>You can't think of this movie without the background.  This is what makes it great.  The little things the director and writers add to help make the setting make this real.  By far the funniest dig on our culture is the advertisement for the car with low mileage.<p>I would recommend seeing this movie.</p></body></html>

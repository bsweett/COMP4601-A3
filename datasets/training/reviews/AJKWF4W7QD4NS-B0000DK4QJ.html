<meta name="summary" content="A bold new classic for the genre"></head><body><p>Based on a short story from Philip K. Dick (whose other short stories had inspired Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Imposter), Steven Spielberg brings us a dark (but not too dark) vision of an all too real future world.  In the year 2054 in Washington, D.C., there is a new police force called PreCrime which apprehends murderers before they commit the crime.  For this method, three "PreCogs" are used to predict the crime thanks to drug induced mutation combined with psychic ability.  PreCrime leader John Anderton (Tom Cruise) believes heavily in the system and is the best officer on the force, until the PreCogs predict him as a murderer.  Now, Anderton is on the run while trying to unraval a vast conspiracy that will change everything he believes in.  First off I want to say that this vision of the future is very believeable, and the visual effects are incredible as well.  Spielberg's direction is some of his best here, and next to Schindler's List this is his best directorial effort.  Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances as Anderton, and his character development is paced along well.  Great, memorable roles for Max von Sydow, Colin Farrel (who steals many of his scenes with Cruise), and Samantha Morton (who is heartbreakingly tragic as a PreCog Cruise kidnaps) are among many highpoints of Minority Report, and this is without a doubt a new sci-fi classic that will be revered for years.</p></body></html>

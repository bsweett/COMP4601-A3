<meta name="summary" content="Four Brothers"></head><body><p>Evelyn Mercer (Flanagan) was a foster mom all her life, taking in many kids.  In all her life there were only four kids that she could not find homes for: Bobby (Wahlberg), Angel (Gibson), Jeremiah (Benjamin), and Jack (Hedlund).  They were still bad seeds, but not nearly as bad as they would have been without Evelyn.  They considered her to be their mother, and each other to be brothers.<br /><br />Evelyn's murder at a convenience store in her neighborhood brings the four brothers back home.  They attend the funeral and soon decide that since Evelyn did so much for them, perhaps they should do some informal investigating into her murder.  It doesn't take long for them to sense there was more to it than Evelyn being caught in a simple robbery, and the brothers begin to rattle some cages that may be better left unrattled.<br /><br />One of the strongest points of "Four Brothers" is the relationship between the brothers.  The comraderie is very beliveable, and is what holds the film together.  "Four Brothers" is very much a revenge film set in the mean streets of Detroit, and as such is successful.  This movie engaged me more than I anticipated, and I was pleasantly surprised with it.  For those seeking a good urban revenge movie, look no further than "Four Brothers".</p></body></html>

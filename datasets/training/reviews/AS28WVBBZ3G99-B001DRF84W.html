<meta name="summary" content="This movie is a mess."></head><body><p>This movie is just awful. The bleakness of the story line is  only slightly worse than the emptiness and vapidity of the acting. The love story between Banner and his girl-friend (Connelly) lacks any warmth or interest. And what should have been a powerful relationship between Banner and his father ends up ragged, confused, and senseless.<p>For those old enough to have enjoyed either the Stan Lee comics or the TV show, ignore this movie. It is but a poor reflection of a creative and engaging sotry. This weak rendition will leave you empty and disappointed.</p></body></html>

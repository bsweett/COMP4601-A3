I love this movie true the zombies look fake<br />especially when compared to Fulci's classic ZOMBIE but WHO CARES!!!<br />We have a story with characters that I found myself caring about<br />a great script and find directing. Sir Romero has always been great at<br />adding humor to his HORROR and D.O.T.D. is no exception from the beginning<br />we have chaos for the entire United States is being plagued by zombies<br />and the few humans that are alive must leave but to where???<br />Our four heroes steal a helicopter and find a abandon shopping mall.<br />We are already 20 min. into the movie but this is where it starts for<br />me for this is where I found myself caring about the four stars and hoping they all make it alive(which is unusual for your buddy Clint<br />for normally I say LET THEM DIE!) When two of our heroes GET IT<br />so to speak I was angry!  The way this movie builds up and ends<br />was funtastic(sic) and I am truly glad to have in my HORROR COLL.<br />If you are not big on GORE(shame on you) than please stay away<br />however if you can handle heads chopped off by helicopter,limbs<br />being eaten and children being blown away by a machine gun than<br />by all means watch DAWN of the DEAD for it is ONE of our greatest<br />HORROR films especially for 78(the awesome HALLOWEEN and INVASION of the<br />BODY SNATCHERS also came out this year) the ultimate edition is the<br />only way to go on this flick for it has in depth views on the making<br />and of course all three versions of the film(I prefer the extended<br />version myself Romero's dir.cut is 2nd and you can have the awful<br />Dario Argento cut LOVE YA DARIO STILL) anyway if you love HORROR<br />DAWN of the DEAD is a must!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A strong addition to a full body of work"></head><body><p>This movie feels no different than any other Wes Anderson film - it has Owen Wilson and Bill Murray and Anjelica Huston in it - and yet, there's something different.  What is it that is not quite the same?  Is it the fact that the film is set in India, that his cast of characters now includes Adrian Brody, or that it's finally been made clear that all the films are intended to run together?  There's nothing in the films any more that can be separated from one another, and maybe that's a good thing - aren't Nobel prizes granted for a cohesive body of work, rather than a single masterpiece?  Non sequitar dialogue, non sequitar scenery, the trademark drift around the location, and the subtle (but hilarious) sight gags - in this one, our protagonists inexplicably buy a cobra at market.  This one has the heavily mustachioed Jason Schwartzman, an actor I don't know but have enjoyed in this film; he also helped to write the screenplay, indicating that he's entered the troupe (maybe he's been in it for a while and I'm only noticing now...).  Flashback scenes where he is clean shaven are interesting for contrast, as is the "play before the movie" sequence with him and Nathalie Portman, playing a slutty something-or-other. The film strikes me as one of the more enjoyable Wes Anderson movies.  I like it.  Bill Murray's small, subtle role is great (some may consider it a mere sight gag), as is the Indian setting, as are the train staff, as are the villagers, as is the tiger.  Go, tiger, go.</p></body></html>

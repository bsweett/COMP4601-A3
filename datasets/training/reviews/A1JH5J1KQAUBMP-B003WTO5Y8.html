Every element of this film is dead on.  Foster plays Clarice as sensitive and uncertain, yet brave, brilliant, and unwilling to succumb to her fears.  Hopkins gives a performance of such stunning power that the figure of Hannibal Lector immediately attained pop icon status.  Jonathan Demme's direction, incorporating numerous point-of-view shots, draws us right into the story and keeps the tension building.  Ted Tally's screenplay (from the Thomas Harris novel) cuts right to the essentials of the story and Howard Shore's score is atmospheric yet unobstrusive.  This is an essential film for anyone who enjoys horror or suspense./</p></body></html>

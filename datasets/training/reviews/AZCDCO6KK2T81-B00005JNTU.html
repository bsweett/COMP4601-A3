<meta name="summary" content="Popcorn Fun!"></head><body><p>A great summer film with really special special effects, a fun cast, and a simple story that is well-paced.  This is fun for the whole family.  I especially like that it isn't burdened down with Fruedian psycho-babble like so many comic book movies.  That has it's place and can add to a film, but this superhero story would just be dragged down by all that.  This is just fun popcorn entertainment.  A pleasant diversion from anything serious.<br /><br />The direction is swift and competent and doesn't get in the way.  Each hero/actor pulls his or her own weight and they all work well in this ensemble piece much like the X-Men series characters do.  The script is fun and funny, but nothing special.  It is a paint-by-numbers storyline.  The music is unremarkable for a superhero film and that is a serious flaw by my standards.<br /><br />This film has great repeat value and perfect for a day when one is shut in.  It is well-worth owning.</p></body></html>

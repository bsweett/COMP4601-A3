<meta name="summary" content="Hanson's LA film noir"></head><body><p>Prior to making this film noir classic in the tradition of "Chinatown", Curtis Hanson made 2 films which helped along with this film to elevate him to the A-list of directors--"The River Wild" & "The Bedroom Window" (a film noir in the tradition of Hitchcock).  With the success of this film (several Oscar nominations with a win for Kim Basinger and Best Picture/Director nod), Hanson went on to make the under-rated "Wonder Boys", "8 Mile" w/Enimen and the chick flick "In Her Shoes".  But none matched the success of this classic film noir based on a James Ellroy novel. Why?  For one thing he had a fool-proof cast with veterans, Kevin Spacey, Danny Devito & James Cromwell matched with the 2 new Australian newcomers, Russell Crowe & Guy Pearce in their first all-American roles. Also Kim Basinger delivered a poignant Oscar winning performance as Hollywood prostitute who is redemned by her relationship with Crowe's character, Bud White.  Another plus is the sharp dialogue courtesy of Ellroy and the great score by Jerry Goldsmith.  If you liked "Chinatown"(which Goldsmith also contributed a memorable score) then you'll like this one.  Devotees of the book may balk at the happy ending of the film versus the book but perhaps that would've lessen the films chance for box off success--who knows. If it where not for the movie about that big boat that sank, this film would've copped the Best Picture Oscar!!  I can't wait for the Blu-ray release of this classic!!</p></body></html>

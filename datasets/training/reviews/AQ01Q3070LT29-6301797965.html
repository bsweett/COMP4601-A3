Frankenstein is considered film literature.  It was required watching in school, just like &quot;Great Expectation&quot; is required reading.  All movie buffs know of Frankenstein (played by Boris Karloff in 1931) and trivia questions and jokes are made of it.  Now, this film, Young Frankenstein is of the genius writing by Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks.  Produced by Michael Groskoff.  Directed by Mel Brooks.  Released by 20th Century Fox in December 1974.  This fine film is a spoof of the Frankenstein films.  It is a comedy, you may laugh at it all that you want to.  It was made for laughter.  The excellent cast: Gene Wilder, Peter Boyle, Marty Feldman, Cloris Leachman, Teri Garr and the lovely Madeline Kahn.  Gene Hackman plays the blind man.  I wish Gene Wilder could have been nominated for an Academy Award for Outstanding Actor, but him and Mel Brooks were nominated for Outstanding Screenplay.  The film was also nominated for Best Sound.  1974 was a tough year for Oscar.  So many wonderful films were shown.  In the special features, there is 16 minutes of deleted scenes and 5 minutes of outtakes.  There are mexican interviews with Marty Feldman, Gene Wilder and Chris Leachman.  A 36-minute documentary &quot;Making Frankensense of Young Frankenstein&quot;.  By the way, there is an in-joke for you if you click on &quot;Television Spots&quot;</p></body></html>

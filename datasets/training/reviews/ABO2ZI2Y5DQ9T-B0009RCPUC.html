<meta name="summary" content="Downfall, or Last Days of Adolf; Simply Absorbing"></head><body><p>Of course, this is not the first film that features Adolf Hitler in the center -- Charlie Chaplin did it.  Or, this is not the first film that shows the last days of his empire -- Obi Wan did it (no, not Ewan, I'm talking about Alec).  But seeing the downfall of Adolf Hitler speaking in his original language is something you should never miss, especially when he is played by Bruno Ganz.<br /><br />In short, the title of 'Downfall' describes exactly what it is.  It's about the last days of Hitler and Nati, and like a big ship going down, the falling empire sucks many people deep into the dark void.  In this case, however, it's a mental one -- some try to maintain the order; some run away from reality (usual method, booze); or some just do nothing.  And Hitler?  Oh, you know his fate -- Eva Brown and lots of gasoline.<br /><br />ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE THINGS about this film is the actors' uncanny resemblance.  The chillingly realistic portrayal of Hitler is done by German-speaking Bruno Ganz (though actually he is a Swiss), whose authentic image and mannerism as Adolf will stay with you long after leaving the theater.  (One irony is that ganz is best remembered by his turn as a winged angel in 'Wings of Desire' set in the same city -- Berlin).<br /><br />Also, see the film's realistic Goebbels and Himler, and compare them with the real-life counterpart.  Director Oliver Hirschbiegel (see his gripping prison thriller 'Das Experiment') surely did research.  In a sense, Goebbels and his wife (and children) offer the most unnerving scene in the film, which is, I am afraid, very painful to watch.<br /><br />Though it is obvious that Hitler plays the pivotical role in 'Downfall,' the film is in fact about everyone, soldiers or civilians, who surrounded him in the last days of the Third Reich.  The film starts with memoirs narrated by a secretary Traudi Junge hired by Hitler himself, but soon we realize that the film has multi-layered stories that concern all the people in Berlin.  And it also concerns their downfall.<br /><br />Some words about the negative reviews on political ground.  Some blames the filmmaker for ignoring the fate of Jewish people.  The fact is, it doesn't (see to the ending).  But if the film wants to spend so much time in depicting the last days of Hitler in the claustrophobic bunker, well, it is entitled to it, and any (I mean any) people who received decent education already know the pains and deaths Jewish people suffered during the WWII.<br /><br />The film is always revetting with the convincing atmosphere of the war, and is often terrifying in depicting the atrocious things done during the last days of Hitler, who is clearly losing his mind.  But more horrible thing is many people are faithful to his unreasonable orders, and as Goebbels points out at one scene, no one really forced them to do it.  They are willing to obey, and they actually did.  Perhaps after watching this film, your knowledge about Hitler will not change very much.  But the point is, the film is successful in showing him as he is -- he remains as incredibly contradictory, impossible presence throughout, not as monster, but as human.  And that's why this small man is so frightening.</p></body></html>

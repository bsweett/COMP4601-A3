<meta name="summary" content="Another Unidentifiable, Pointless Film from PTA. But This One is Entertaining."></head><body><p>"There Will Be Blood" is Paul Thomas Anderson's loose interpretation of Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel "Oil!". In this version, prospector Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis) sets out to become an oil magnate in turn-of-the-century California. He aggressively obtains drilling rights from landowners under somewhat dubious terms and pays them a royalty. In 1911, a man from the town of New Boston sells Daniel information about oil on his family ranch. With his young son H.W. (Dillon Freasier), Daniel sets out to buy all the land he can get in New Boston before his competitors do. But his promises to bring prosperity to the town must compete with charismatic local religious demagogue Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) for the hearts and souls of the citizens.<br /><br />"There Will Be Blood" is entertaining for about two-thirds of its 2 hour 38 minute run time. We spend the first 15 minutes watching Daniel prospect for silver and oil, to give you some idea of the pace. The story is not in any way realistic beyond the naturalistic production design, and the last third goes too far over the top to sustain credibility. As is typical of Paul Thomas Anderson, who wrote as well as directed this film, it's not clear just what the film is supposed to be. Every scene unfolds with gravity, but the endless power struggle between Daniel and Eli is black comedy. Daniel Day Lewis' Oscar-winning performance is not realistic, but rather an affected acting style that is suited to the film's dark humor and implausible behavior.<br /><br />We seem to have a black comedy and a character study that is hardly believable, presented as epic drama. It makes very little sense. Daniel Day Lewis' histrionics must carry the entire film. And they do. Daniel Plainview believes in single-minded ambition for its own sake, and his venom is something to see. The conflict with Eli Sunday is perversely amusing. And young H.W., buffeted about by his father's goals, evokes the audience's sympathy. Mind you, they are in a plot whose parts do not coalesce. And beyond the director's low opinion of oilmen and preachers, there is no point, and for a while I thought there would be no end. But most of it is entertaining, so this is a big improvement as Paul Thomas Anderson's films go.</p></body></html>

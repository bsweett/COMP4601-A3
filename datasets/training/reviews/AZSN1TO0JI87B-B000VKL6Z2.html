<meta name="summary" content="Happy Halloween?"></head><body><p>When it was announced last year that rocker-turned-director Rob Zombie would be helming a remake of John Carpenter's "Halloween," it was met with mixed reactions. Some balked at the idea of remaking such a vital and iconic movie, while others were anxious to see what such a unique character as Rob could do with the material. Count me in the latter. It helps being a fan of his music from the beginning, but also take into consideration how poor the past few "Halloween" movies have been. If anyone were to remake it, could it turn out any better than Rob Zombie's? Even after watching it twice, and both times being frustrated with it's lack of focus, I still say the answer to that question is most certainly "no."<br /><br />We all know the story of the Boogeyman, The Shape, or quite simply, Michael Myers. So to do a shot-for-shot remake (ala "Psycho") or anything of the like would be silly. Which is exactly where the trouble with this movie lies. "Halloween 2007," as I will refer to it from here-on-out, plays like two very different movies fused together. First, we have Rob's vision. A Michael Myers with a story. He might not be given much motivation, but what Rob gives us in the first half is not only intriguing and disturbing, but actually refreshing when compared to the sequels. This is where he truly makes his mark and reinvents Michael Myers as we know him. About 45 minutes into the movie, however, it takes a turn. From out of nowhere, Rob starts rushing into a lazy remake of the original movie's events. We are introduced to Laurie Strode, this time played by fresh-faced Scout Taylor-Compton, along with Annie (played by Danielle Harris, making a bold return to the series) and Linda (Kristina Klebe). The three girls spout off lines from the original in such an off-handed way that you feel like you're watching an amateur film-maker fresh out of his first high school film-making class. To say the dialogue is terrible would be an understatement: it cripples the second half of the second movie completely! Virtually nothing in the second half of the film is effective. The kids are routinely dispatched in such a careless way. Some characters die after only being in the movie for a matter of moments. There is no character development for the second half, so it's hard to feel any tension. It was nice to see Rob recreate some memorable moments in his own way, and Danielle Harris has some truly unforgettable moments with Michael, but other than that, it's a dud, and as someone who awaited this movie with baited breath (a big "Halloween" nut and Rob Zombie fan, mind you), I found myself yawning from time to time in the last half. And let's not even get into it's dud of an ending. Had Rob Zombie stuck with what he had established in the first half and forgotten about paying tribute to the original movie (or whatever he was trying to do) in the second half, the results could have been much, much better.<br /><br />On a more positive note, it sports an impressive cast. Not only is it satisfying to see Danielle Harris once again facing Michael Myers, but Malcolm McDowell ("A Clockwork Orange") is about the best they could have done to replace Donald Pleasence and Sam Loomis. Brad "Chucky" Dourif, as Sheriff Brackett, is spot on, but unfortunately gets very little time. Just about everyone involved in "The Devil's Rejects" gets a part, from Bill Moseley, William Forsythe, Ken Foree, Sid Haig and Sheri Moon Zombie, who takes advantage of her role as Michael's mom and surprisingly goes against the stereotype she has been built up to. Danny Trejo, however, was the biggest surprise, and his parts with Michael are those that work best. His fate serves as the best example of Michael's lack of reason or mercy, and truly makes him a horror villian to be reckoned with and may be enough to send chills down the spines of even the biggest horror fans. Daeg Faerch, who plays a young Michael Myers, is also a nice surprise, as kids in horror movies can tend to be annoying. Yet, he turns in a very creepy and very believeable performance of a very disturbed young boy.<br /><br />The movie, on the whole, looks gorgeous. Rob obviously knows his stuff, but the major problem is in the script. At times, the movie feels incomplete, and at others, it feels like he is making it up as he goes along. It goes without saying that the original didn't need to be remade, as it is still effective to this day, so if a "re-telling" was neccessary, why didn't Rob make it his own? Like "Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers," you can literally smell the studio interference here. The movie not only makes little sense, but feels incomplete and rushed. What starts off as an intriguing and refreshing take on a well-known character, eventually degrades itself into boring drivel. It's painful to say it, but Rob's vision of "Halloween" hardly pans out any better than the dismal "H20" or "Resurrection." Even those watching who don't know the original should sense that something is wrong here. It's like Rob Zombie either didn't have the confidence to make this his own, or didn't really want to make the film in the first place.</p></body></html>

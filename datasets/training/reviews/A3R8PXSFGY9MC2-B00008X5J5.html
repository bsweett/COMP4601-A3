<meta name="summary" content="Sleeping Beauty"></head><body><p>`Sleeping Beauty' is a classic Disney animation from before the time of CG and computer trickery and it has to be said it is even more beautiful in it's restored state. Following the fairy tale of sleeping beauty who is cursed by a witch to sleep until woken by her one true love this film has a great story for kids, some musical numbers and is interesting enough for adults to enjoy as well. The witch, Maleficent, is quite sinister at times and the parts of the film which feature her are quite dark and small children may get scared, but not excessively so. It is funny to watch this film after it was so brilliantly parodied by 'Shrek', but that doesn't detract from the charm of this film in the slightest, in fact it seems all the better for it. The extras are what we have come to expect from Disney re-releases, a making of feature, music video of the theme song, deleted scenes and various games for younger viewers. I always feel the extras have more to offer kids than adults but I guess this is essentially a children's film despite the obvious enjoyment adults will get from it as well. This is a classic Disney film and whilst it lacks the excitement or artistic skill of films such as 'Pinocchio', this should still be added to your Disney collection at some point.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

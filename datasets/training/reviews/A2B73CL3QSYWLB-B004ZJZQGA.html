So many films you go into with certain expectations and "In Bruges" defies them for the better.  I categorize this film with "Pulp Fiction", "The Usual Suspects" and "Memento" as recent films that actually expand the language of the cinema.  Director-scenarist Martin McDonagh does not take his cues from anyone.  Many would lump this with Tarantino and Ritchie but this is a unique work.  How many films center around hitmen where nary a bullet is fired except in flashback?  This is a somber piece about men who rue their profession and regret the choices they've made infused with a certain level of wry humor.  The film's main focus is on character but there are some fantastic story twists.  The film's setting, the medieval city of Bruges in Belgium, adds to the film's exotic appeal.  Colin Farrel finally given a role worthy of his talents, shines as the greenhorn gunman, Ray.  Brendan Gleeson gives his best performance since "The General" as the more sensible hitman, Ken.  Ralph Fiennes account of a ruthless crime boss is the best of it's kind since Ben Kingsley in "Sexy Beast".  Fiennes gives you the chills even with his disembodied voice over the telephone.  This is rough going in terms of language and violence but ultimately you'll walk away impressed by "In Bruges".</p></body></html>

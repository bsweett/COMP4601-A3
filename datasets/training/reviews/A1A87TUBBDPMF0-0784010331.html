<meta name="summary" content="The Ride of Arnold's Life...."></head><body><p>Total Recall, Paul Verhoeven's fascinating (if sometimes very violent) 1990 science fiction/thriller examined the boundaries between reality and illusion. It also established Arnold Schwarzenegger as a true force in the action adventure genre, proving that the former bodybuilder could act in a more challenging role than Conan or the Terminator.<p>Inspired by Philip K. Dick's story "We Can Dream It For You Wholesale," the screenplay by Ronald Shussett, Dan O'Bannon (Alien) and Gary Goldman weaves a clever tapestry of story threads that revolve around the question of what is reality and what is a dream, especially if the mind could be manipulated artificially?<p>Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid, a construction worker happily married to Lori (Sharon Stone) and living in a city perhaps 100 years in the future.  By this time, Earth is embroiled in a major war between the Northern and Southern Blocs, space travel is as routine as catching a bus, and Mars has been colonized. Its governor, a ruthless dictator named Cohaagen (Ronny Cox) is providing the Northern bloc with essential raw materials and suppressing a bloody insurrection led by mutants.<p>Quaid is obsessed with a fantasy of Mars -- in his dreams he's there, in the company of a mysterious brunette (Rachel Ticotin), much to Lori's chagrin. Even as he claims it's just a fantasy and that Lori's the only woman in his life, he still presses the issue of Mars, going as far to suggest leaving Earth and moving to the Red Planet.  Lori attempts to reason with Quaid, telling him he'd "hate it there. It's dry, it's dusty, it's boring."  Reluctantly, Quaid relents and goes off to work as usual.<p>But after seeing a commercial for "virtual vacations" on a subway TV monitor, Quaid decides to visit Rekall, where false memories are implanted into customers' minds "for the memory of a lifetime."  With the aid of drugs and hi-tech gizmos, the perfect vacation -- a ski trip, a visit to an exotic beach, or even a trip to Mars -- can be "remembered" as if it had really happened.  Even better, as a smarmy salesman tells Quaid, one can even change personalities and take the "Ego Trip" and become, for a little while, someone else.  Intrigued, Quaid selects -- you guessed it -- the trip to Mars with the secret agent Ego Trip.<p>Verhoeven's films are not known for their quiet subtlety; indeed, they tend to be in-your-face collages of mordant wit, wry one-liners, and -- in his science fiction films (Robocop, Starship Troopers) -- violence.  Yet, when watching this movie on DVD and listening to the audio commentary by Verhoeven and Schwarznegger, I was surprised by the complexity of this film's plot.  Yes, it's action packed and it's an "Ah-nuld" showcase full of droll one-liners ("Consider this a divorce!"), but it doesn't insult the audience's intelligence.  The movie's eye-popping (pun intended) special effects are amazing, and Jerry Goldsmith's score is thrilling.<p>The Artisan Special Edition of Total Recall is loaded with various extra features and showcases this above-average sci-fi thriller in a newly remastered widescreen version. The picture is sharp and the sound is excellently clear.  Considering that Artisan is also behind the spectacular DVDs for the first two Terminator films, this is to be expected!<p>I strongly recommend Total Recall to both Schwarzenegger and science fiction fans alike; its underlying storyline is intriguing, and Arnold has rarely been in better form as an actor!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Smith's performance is utter perfection and elevates this film to the must see list..."></head><body><p>When you look at `I Am Legend' you may initially shrug it off as nothing more than summer blockbuster popcorn fluff; just another horror film targeting today's youth and wasting our hard earned money.  You will most likely still go see it because, quite frankly, no one can resist Will Smith.  The film will start and you'll think that the depictions of New York, barren and desolate, are pretty creepy.  You'll see Smith driving a hundred miles an hour down the empty streets and you'll wish you could do that.  You'll see him hunting deer with his dog and it'll all seem pretty cool but what you won't realize is that you are slowly being drawn into the loneliness that is Robert Neville's existence.  You will watch his everyday life unfold and you'll find yourself feeling cold and distant and alone.  Before a single `vampire' appears on the screen you will be petrified.<br /><br />`I Am Legend' works so well because Will Smith is really that good in it.  Regardless of what anyone says, Will Smith is one excellent actor.  He's the type of actor that has everything you need to be successful.  He's attractive, he has charm and charisma; he's a riot in person and on film but he can also evoke very mature and stunning emotions that many wouldn't assign him.  In that respect he always proves himself a surprise to the viewer.  Here is no exception.  He elevates what could have been nothing more than a Hollywood monster movie into a serious and commanding look at loneliness and desperation.  In fact I'll be so blunt as to say that the best scenes in this film are when Will Smith is the only person on the screen, when he is alone and vulnerable; not when he is being pursued by the monsters.<br /><br />`I Am Legend' is the third revamping of Richard Matheson's 1954 novel of the same name.  It tells the story of Robert Neville, a scientist who happens to be the only survivor after an outbreak turns the world's population into walking zombies, or vampires.  He walks the streets of Manhattan during the daylight with his loyal German Shepherd Samantha and hides in his home at night while the creatures roam the streets looking for food.  During the day he attempts to live a life that is as normal as possible.  He sets up mannequins in video stores and carries on conversations with them.  He sticks to a schedule of exercise and meals and hunting.  He drives in his car and listens to Bob Marley and talks to his dog and pretty much does everything he can to stay sane.  He also broadcasts a message over the airwaves everyday looking for other survivors and he waits at the dock everyday at a specific time for them to arrive.<br /><br />The first half of `I Am Legend' plays out much better than the second because it's a slow build of human emotion.  Watching Smith's desperation grow across his face we are brought into his life and his situation and we feel his pain.  The second half, which introduces to us the creatures as well as another human survivor, steps a little bit away from the focus on Neville's loneliness and tries a little too hard to force fear on us by using the creatures.  This fear would have been much more rewarding had the creatures not looked so CGI animated.  They somewhat take away from the realness and rawness of the film when they look more like aliens then mutated humans.<br /><br />One thing that remains on point throughout though is Will Smith.  This may be one of his finest performances to date, seriously.  The emotion that he portrays his so real, so strong.  There is one scene in particular, where he breaks down crying in the video store as he begs for a female mannequin to talk to him, that got me all choked up.  His performance is so committed, so vital to the film that you can't help but give him props for delivering a very believable and very moving performance.<br /><br />In the end there are some things I would have changed here.  I would have hired actual actors for the roles of the `vampires' (although I hear that they had initially done that but felt that they looked too much like mimes) because I feel that the CGI was a little overdone.  I would have stuck a little closer to the book and eliminated the `other' survivor.  But there are too many things that I would have left alone; that work so well here that it seems silly to complain.  The first half of the film is in a word `perfect' and that alone is enough to elevate the rest of the film.  Smith is a goldmine of emotion here and delivers a solid award worthy performance that tops his Oscar nominated performance from last year.<br /><br />If the CGI creatures hadn't spoiled my fun (just a little) I would be quick to label `I Am Legend' as one of the best films of 2007.  That little issue aside though, `I Am Legend' is far better than some may expect and will definitely leave you with much to talk about.</p></body></html>

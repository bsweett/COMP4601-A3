<meta name="summary" content="Too bad it wasn't more pro-war"></head><body><p>Hate the war but love the soldier...or at least try to understand how good men can willingly be turned into killers who will shoot whatever they are told to.<br /><br />Jarhead seems to move back and forth between pointing out how the military is designed to create mindless, order-following killing machines, and then examining soldiers' frustration at not killing anyone. The scene with them cheering the battle scenes in Apocalypse Now is ironic in the extreme.<br /><br />The narrative moves well, even during the war-is-hellish-boredom parts. What lifts this film to a higher level are Gyllenhall's excellent performance (along with Foxx and most everyone else) and the stunning cinematography of the second half.<br /><br />The flaming oil fields and their resultant chaos are grippingly weird, making a strong but silent point about why we send our kids to die halfway around the world for the benefit of rich old men who don't give a damn about them. This film succeeds when it lets you get inside the heads of certain characters who have stopped thinking but can't stop feeling; it rarely judges the soldiers, instead showing their humanity and confusion when turned into automatons.<br /><br />My father was in the military, and he made me promise never to enlist, saying, "Their goal was to make me stop thinking completely. If we thought about it, why would we want to kill fathers and brothers and sons who are just like us, but born somewhere else?"<br /><br />Thus the term "jarhead"; the jar is emptied of Christian compassion for every one of God's children, and refilled with bloodlust.<br /><br />This is a much more subtle film in many ways, despite its graphic nature, than most reviewers here want to accept. The scene with the horse is absolutely perfect, saying so much with a simple, heart-breaking picture.<br /><br />Life isn't always "you're with us or against us"; sometimes it's "you're with us until we don't need you any more." Jarhead does a good job of making that and many other points.</p></body></html>

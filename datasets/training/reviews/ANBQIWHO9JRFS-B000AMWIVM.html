(Well not all thrillers involve serial killers, but virtually all the major recent ones do)  I generally don't watch these films.  Sure, 'Silence of the Lambs' was pretty good, and 'Seven' was good too, but most of these films just look tedious and formulaic, and what little I have seen has fulfilled these expectations. Now we have 'Saw', and I'm pleased to say that it isn't really a thriller, and leans more to the horror side of the spectrum.  Sure, there's a serial killer in the movie, and the visual style is massively indebted to Fincher, but at it's heart, 'Saw' is really just a low-budget horror film.(Only about a million dollar budget, shot in 2 1/2 weeks)  These sorts of films can't complete with major productions in terms of acting and production values, so they put all the emphasis on ideas and scenes.(Well, the good ones do, anyway)  So understand this all coming in- the acting isn't going to be up to major production standards, and the plot isn't going to be as developed or plausible.  If you can't get over those two things, you aren't going to enjoy this.  'Saw', however, makes up for it in other ways.  It's got frightful, intriguing ideas and interesting scenes and a strong, expressionistic (if derivative) visual style.  It may not all add up cleanly at the end, but the scenes are good enough that that doesn't really matter.<br /><br />Though I'm sure everyone already knows, the basic setup is this: Adam and Lawrence wake up in an old, abandoned bathroom.  They are each chained to pipes on the opposite sides of the room.  There is a corpse in between them, an apparent suicide victim, who is holding a tape player and a gun.  They soon learn that they are the victims of the Jigsaw killer, who places people in a elaborate games of death, from which they may be able to escape alive.  They will have to suffer, however.  In this case, Jigsaw requires that Lawrence kill Adam by 6:00, or else Jigsaw will kill Lawrence's family.  The rest of the movie is just their attempts to deal with this situation, and some flashbacks to help them figure out just what is going on.(They're more than a little disoriented, initially) This basic setup is more horror than thriller, as the police only play a very minor role, and there is very little investigation into the killer's life or identity.  They are simply common people in a life or death situation, who must escape.  In lots of ways, the basic plot is pretty Giallo-esque.(Italian thriller precursors which involved a crime investigation,but almost invariably placed style, atmosphere and set-pieces ahead of plot or plausibility)  It uses numerous giallo conventions: the protagonists are regular people, every character matters, the killer's motivation is very giallo-esque (can't be completely specific w/o giving too much away) most everything proves to be connected, and the mandatory twist ending is more of a ludicrous sick joke than a grand revelation. (Not to say that I don't like the ending. I like it a lot)  Naturally, this sort of film is even more convoluted and unlikely that you typical thriller, and I suspect it's just a reflection of sloppy writing rather than same grand scheme, but it reveals the general aesthetic of both these types of films: scenes and ideas first, plot second.<br /><br />Visually, the film is a combination of ultra grimy, sleazy settings with a few high-class but cold and dark places as well.  As I said before, it is massively indebted to David Fincher's work, but that's a very good style.  Well worth ripping off.  The intense griminess and stylization of visuals also sets it apart from most thrillers, as it is taken to such a point that the world no longer seems even remotely real. (Though some thrillers are like this. i.e. `Seven',) Sometimes Wan over does it a little, with some fast-motion-spinny-camera stuff that's just sorta silly, but most of the time it works.  There are some very weird visuals that are, once again, quite typical of independent horror and giallos while being foreign to mainstream thrillers.  For example, `Jigsaw' likes to use a disturbing little ventriloquist dummy as his avatar while communicating with his victims.  He can also be quite flamboyantly dressed, with a huge, shimmery red or black cloak and a bizarre mask.  There's really no explanation why he would choose to be like that, he just does, because the filmmakers thought it would be cool or scary.  Though the film is very dark and grisly it isn't extremely gory.  Much of the violence is shown fairly obscurely or not at all, but what happens is conceptually nasty enough that it is plenty effective even without being given a close, detailed view.  What gore there is is generally fairly well done, particularly considering the budget they had.<br /><br />As I keep saying, this film has great scenes, even if they doesn't always make all that much sense.  Most notably, the whole setup is just great, I think.  Convoluted and highly, highly unlikely, but great.  Some specifics:  A particularly effective scene is when we see the ordeal of Jigsaw's one surviving victim, who had to dig a key out a man intestinal track in order to remove a giant metal device from her heard, which is set to rip her jaws apart if she takes too long.  Similarly excellent is the scene where Adam is abducted, as he wanders about his powerless apart, randomly taking pictures to provide a small, brief bit of illumination.  And, the climax, while I cant go into specifics, is really very intense and grisly.  A very effective closing the the film.<br /><br />Despite what anyway may tell you, the acting in this film is perfectly serviceable.  No, it isn't first-rate, and they occasionally blow some lines, but most of the time it's at least passable.  And anyone who really has that big of a problem with the acting doubtless isn't much of a horror fan, so who cares what they think.<br /><br />Yeah, that's it.  Not terribly plausible, but I've never cared about that much anyway.  Virtually everything else works quite well.  Check it out.</p></body></html>

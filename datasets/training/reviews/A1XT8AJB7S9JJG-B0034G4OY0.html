<meta name="summary" content="The events of Japan help this movie to have a different feel then intended.  Very good movie, but slow and sad.  I say B+"></head><body><p>If you had a gift that ruined your life but helped others...would you use it?  After a traumatic expierence as a child George (Damon) receives a gift that allows him to connect to the afterlife.  After years of helping others he decided enough is enough and wants to stop and start living for him.  French journalist Marie (De France) goes through an expierence that leaves her with the same condition.  Finally Marcus, a boy, loses his brother and wants to try and talk to him again.  All three of these stories intertwine and we watch as each person tries to handle what life has thrown at them.  This movie was really good, but also very slow moving.  It reminded me alot of "Babel".  It switches pretty often between the three stories and you start to really feel for all three main stars and identify with thier problems.  With the events that just occured in Japan the opening takes on a whole new feel...good or bad it will effect you in a way the film makers probebly never intended.  Overall I liked the movie, but be prepared, it is slow moving and depressing.  I give it a B+.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Not right away</p></body></html>

It is a moving and thought-provoking film, full of social commentary and could very well be Alfonso Cuaron's best movie, yet.<br /><br />The movie takes place in Britain in the year 2027.  The film opens with Theo Faron (Clive Owen) purchasing coffee at a local shop as the television broadcasts the death of the world's youngest person: an 18-year-old boy named Baby Diego (Jaun Gabriel Yacuzzi).  For eighteen years women have been unable to bear any children.  The government sponsors all sorts of activities to promote sex and promiscuity, but it has been to no avail.  As Theo leaves the coffee shop and walks down the trash-filled streets, a bomb goes off destroying the very shop Theo had just left moments before.<br /><br />Needing a break Theo takes the day off work and takes the train to visit his friend Jasper Palmer (Michael Caine), passing caged illegal immigrants along the way.  Jasper was an award-winning political cartoonist married to an award-winning journalist.  However, when the chaos began his wife was captured by the government and returned as a vegetable.  Jasper cheers Theo up and offers him a perspective about the whole thing.  The next day things seem "normal" but as Theo is on is way to work he is kidnapped by the terrorist group FISH.  He soon learns that the group is being led by his wife, Julian (Julianne Moore).  The group wants to transport a young refugee to the coast so she can be picked up by a ship.  The girl, Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), needs papers and Theo has connections.  However, Theo is also one of the only people that Julian trusts left in the world.  Theo is able to get the papers, but he has to escort Kee.  Along the way the group is attacked and has to take refuge.  Theo learns that Kee is pregnant and that Julian had very serious reasons for only trusting Theo.  Knowing that the hope of the world lies with Kee he sets out to escort her to the coast where she can meet the Human Project, a secret organization that has supposedly a safe haven and is working on a cure for the human infertility problem.<br /><br />The acting of CHILDREN OF MEN is top-notch.  I've only seen a handful of film Clive Owen has acted in and I've enjoyed them all.  He is a classy actor and one whose star will continue to rise.  I really like Julianne Moore and even though she isn't on screen for a very long time, her presence lights up every scene she is in.  Michael Caine is another actor who makes every film he's in just better by being in it and he works his magic in CHILDREN OF MEN (it's also kind of funny seeing Caine make fart jokes and rambling about weed).  Claire-Hope Ashitey is virtually a newcomer to the bigscreen and in her first major role she shines brightly.  The rest of the cast of CHILDREN OF MEN is multi-national and each actor and actress is excellent in their roles.  No one, not even the extras, seem out of place or abnormal.<br /><br />The cinematography in CHILDREN OF MEN is amazing.  Cuaron does some amazing things with the camera.  There are two long, one-camera shots that particular stick out to me:  the car scene was done all in one-long take with one camera and the scene where Theo is escorting Kee out of a building where the terrorists are fighting the government forces was all done in one camera in one take.  These are incredibly long shots (the car scene is almost five minutes in length) and to have them turn out so effectively with so much going on is almost unheard of.  It requires incredible direction and foresight to do such shots, let alone do them effectively.<br /><br />CHILDREN OF MEN is an incredibly dark film.  It's probably too dark and bleak for some people to deal with.  There is a lot of violence, but much of it occurs off screen; people are shot but we only see them falling down from a distance or they are killed off screen with only a spot of blood speckling the camera lens to illustrate what has happened.  The movie is also an incredibly deep social commentary.  Racism, illegal immigration, terrorism, national security, sanitation policies, sex education, euthanasia, media manipulation, and the importance of life are all issues that the film deals with.  Some might be mistaken to believe that the film is anti-government and pro-terrorists (or insurgents).  This isn't the case because the film clearly shows that neither the government nor the terrorists are completely right or wrong; they are fighting a circular war that won't end until one is able to wipe out the other.<br /><br />Despite this bleak view of the humanity and the future, CHILDREN OF MEN is a movie full of hope.  The world can be an incredible dark and dreary place, but hope remains and that changes everything, something I have been reminded of several times lately.  There are some who will not like the film's ending because it doesn't seem to bring closure.  However, in the mood and tone of the film it fits and it doesn't end in despair, but in hope.<br /><br />I found CHILDREN OF MEN to be an incredibly moving picture.  At times it was almost brutal to watch.  Throughout it was a fascinating and riveting piece of cinema.  There are several scenes that have stuck in my mind and I find myself dwelling on during the day.  For instance, in a short, but important scene in the film Theo is having lunch with his cousin and is trying to convince him to get him the papers he needs to escort the girl to the coast.  Sitting at the table is his cousin's son.  The boy is in his mid-twenties and though physically he might be a man, he is really a boy.  He sits at the table eating with one hand while using the other to play with an interactive electronic device attached to his fingers and head.  The boy is so absorbed in what he is doing that he has no idea what is occurring around him, he doesn't even realize that he is eating and his father has to yell at him to get him to put his fork down and take his pill.  The scene is ironic because Theo's cousin has been doing everything he can to save and restore the world's great pieces of art and culture.  Theo asks him why he does it when in thirty years none of it will matter and he replies that it doesn't matter because he doesn't think about that.  There is so much in that scene that can be taken away; so much to think about.  Theo's cousin might not think about the future, but we need to.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="John McClane as archetypal hero"></head><body><p>When I clicked on the movie and scrolled down to the reviews, I fully expected reviewers to bust "Live Free or Die Hard" for its exaggerated action showing McClane coming out of each sequence with minimal injuries. However, I was pleasantly surprised to discover how much praise the movie had received, not only for the action, but for an aging McClane/Willis. As I continued to read the reviews, the idea of hero archetype began to unfold in my mind.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW<br />If you have seen the movie, please follow the flow of action: Archetypal hero is given a quest (task--Police Chief: Pick up a hacker), overcome all sorts of obstacles (action scenes are plentiful and incredible), rescue the kingdom (United States), kill the villain (hacker supreme), and rescue the princess (daughter, check) and marry her. No, but the subordinate Matt (hacker frontline) is becoming "that man" and a declaration of interest is made. "That man" is in reference to Matt's questioning McClane: Why do you do it? Answer: Because I am the only one.<br /><br />With McClane as archetypal hero (think Luke Skywalker and Hans Solo; Viggo Mortensen in LOTR), he must have a specific quest. In this case, Save America from the Fire Sale: Everything must go." Since the beginning, Americans have sought to conquer a frontier. We sailed across the seas in ships. We traveled by wagon over the land until we reached another ocean. We made airships and traveled into space. Americans--always restless, always moving, always seeking. Now cyberspace and virtual reality have become the new frontier.<br /><br />That takes us to the kingdom: cyberspace, specifically America's cyberspace. This film serves as sirens, clanging bells, bullhorns--as warnings that America is under imminent attack from cyberspace terrorists. We had best prepare ourselves. Matt's line: I thought it would be cool to see if it (Fire sale) could be done. McClane: We're not talking about computers here, we're talking about people. This is about people. "Fire Sale" in cyberspace/hacker terms refers to the destruction of the infrastructure: transportation, utilities, financial institutions, all run by computer.<br /><br />Thomas Gabriel is the Dark Side (Darth Vader), both originally on the kingdom's side, each turning for individual reasons. Gabriel becomes the catalyst for McClane's actions in saving the kingdom. Gabriel explains that it is better for one of "us" to bring down the kingdom than an outsider. Really? Destruction is destruction is evil.<br /><br />In another point, McClane not only represents the archetypal hero, but portrays some elements of the Wise Old Man, another obvious archetype (Obi Wan Kenobi, Gandalf, Merlin). The very mention of McClane's age invokes this vital archetype--hero into Wise Old Man. If there is a sequel, will John McClane become New York's Chief of Police? No, I see Chief of Homeland Security ahead with Justin Long's Matt as his second in command. What will John do in this position? Is he up to it? I think so. By then he WILL be the Wise Old Man.</p></body></html>

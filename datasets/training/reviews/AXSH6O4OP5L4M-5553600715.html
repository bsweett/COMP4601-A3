<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful acting"></head><body><p>I think that there's been so much hype over the Kidman-Cruise love-hate relationship over the years, that I haven't really been willing to give the actress her due professionally.  I bought The Others because I enjoy a good ghost story, and this one sounded pretty good from the descriptions I'd read of it.  Surprisingly I not only got the great ghost story I wanted, I got a new definition for Ms Kidman:  superb performer.  Her portrayal of a slightly unbalanced woman with an obsessive concern over the health and well being of her children was a jewel.  The diligent closing of curtains, the compulsive locking of doors behind her created a natural tension that built gradually as an apparently normal mother grew more and more dysfunctional before the viewer's eyes.  The slightly suspect servants who appear at her door in search of employment, after the woman's previous domestics had left without notice, heightens the sense of &quot;something's not quite right&quot; which builds to the denouement.  <p>Although not totally unpredictable, the movie is still a masterpiece of craftsmanship.  While The Sixth Sense, another film I liked, relied more substantially on CGI for its effect upon the viewer, The Others relies completely upon it's set, the progression of events, and the talent of its actors to create that sense of otherworldliness that makes a good story. <p>Since the action occurs almost totally in the various rooms of an old house and to some extent on it's immediate grounds, the movie might make a good stage play, if it isn't one already.  As such it would certainly give ample opportunity for the set designer and the lighting and sound managers to give vent to their creativity.  I'd certainly look forward to such a production.  In all an enjoyable movie.</p></body></html>

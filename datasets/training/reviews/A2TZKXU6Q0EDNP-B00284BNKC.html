<meta name="summary" content="Original, cliche-sparing drugavaganza..."></head><body><p>The reasons this movie is brilliant are -in my opinion- not easily graspable for most people. This becomes more obvious if one reads some of the negative reviews here at Amazon.<br />  I read here in some reviews that this movie is poor because...it's depressive! Since when do films need to be cheery to be good? Is life that way? Is reality, anybody's reality that way? I read in other reviews that this film is not good because &quot;there's no message involved&quot; or because &quot;there's no ethics defended&quot;. I really fail to understand such mindsets. This film is a depiction of reality, a very particular reality, that of people being addicted to heavy drugs and the lives they lead. THAT is the message. It's simply a raw depiction of a specific reality that millions of people (esp. in the west) are experiencing daily. Now, as far as &quot;ethics&quot; are concerned, i'll say this: if the director endulged in some heavy pedagogic diatribe via this film to tell us that &quot;drugs can be dangerous for you&quot; i'd simply say &quot;duh&quot; and watch something else. Besides, he does show that in a more than obvious way. But thankfully, he doesnt attempt to shove an agenda down our throats.<p>  Now to the film itself: I'd already been super-impressed with the director's previous film (the equally brilliant &quot;Pi&quot;) so i was more than intrigued about this one.<br />  I was rewarded again by Aronofsky as a viewer. This film has great camera work (it's through and through cutting edge stuff visually) , great acting, minimal but efficient dialogue,<br />and an absolutely superb conceptual soundtrack (most of it is based on one theme).<p>  It surely is hardcore in its visuals but there's more quality here to be discovered as the director doesnt try to impress with cheap and unrealistic scenes. There's nothing in the film that's over the top or exaggerated and that might sound as self-understood but there are more than enough films with a drug theme that stretch things to extremes visually as if depicting things realistically isn't overwhelming enough.<p>  No need to describe the plot as 10s of other reviews have already done so, so I'll simply reccommend this film (as many others did too) to anybody with a passion for groundbreaking cinema. Extra kudos for Burstyn's performance which is definately show-stealing but even more credits for the fact that &quot;Requiem for a dream&quot; doesn't merely stay on the illegal drug scene but takes a hard stab at the legal drugs. Legal they may be, but there's literally millions of people battling serious addictions from them and they continue to be prescribed massively nevertheless.<p>  An ode to antihypocrisy as well as great filmwork.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Offer You Can't Refuse: One of the Finest Films Ever Made"></head><body><p>Mario Puzo was a critically respected but little known Italian-American writer when he published the 1969 novel THE GODFATHER, a book he himself described as a deliberately commercial work with roots in earlier pulp fiction genres and the plot and characters loosely based on various New York organized crime figures and associates.  Puzo worked with director Francis Ford Coppola to adapt the novel to the screen, and the 1972 film was a spectacular success, loved by the public, acclaimed by the critics, and receiving an armload of awards.  That success spawned an equally successful sequel, THE GODFATHER PART II in 1974, and a significantly less successful sequel, THE GODFATHER PART III, in 1990.  And therein lies a certain problem, for the three films have been re-cut, inter-cut, and fiddled with to such an extent that is actually now a little difficult to see the 1972 THE GODFATHER as it originally appeared.  There are so many versions that it is confusing, but the best guess seems to be the 2006 Paramount widescreen DVD release, which clocks in at 175 minutes--the same run time of the original release.<br /><br />The story, as virtually every film-goer knows, concerns the Corleone family, which is led by patriarch Don Vito Corleone.  The film opens in the late 1940s on his daughter's wedding day, during which Don Corleone receives requests for favors--favors that range from punishing two would-be rapists to securing a film deal for fading star Johnny Fontaine (a character widely believed, in spite of Puzo's protests, to be based on Frank Sinatra.)  Once the characters are established, the film gets underway with mafia trips to Los Angeles and Las Vegas, an attempted hit on Don Vito Corleone, and the Corleone response that leads to a massive gang war, all of this served up with lush production values, remarkably rich "color noir" photography, and significant violence.  And then, of course, there are the performances.  Quite simply, was the peak for all concerned.  From Marlon Brando to Al Pachino, from Talia Shire to an unexpectedly cast Diane Keaton, not a single of the cast ever gave a better performance or appeared in a finer film, and certainly director Francis Ford Coppola, in spite of several famous and widely lauded films, never again reached quite the same heights.<br /><br />Even so, the original THE GODFATHER is somewhat unexpected, and if you haven't seen in some time you may be surprised.  At the time it was considered extremely violent, but in fact most of the violence is implied and that which is shown is seen from a distance, or quickly displayed, or in some other form somewhat underplayed--both the earlier BONNIE AND CLYDE and the later GOODFELLAS are much, much, much more graphically violent films.  What does set the violence of THE GODFATHER apart, however, is that it is remarkably cold.  "It's business," the characters repeatedly say to each other, and the violence involved is performed in a business-like, usually dismissive manner.  Perhaps more disconcerting is how languid and episodic the film is: the pace is generally calm, even to the point of swan-like graciousness, and the story meanders through the lives of the characters without the usual beginning-middle-end structure most American moviegoers expect.  To a certain extent, one can actually describe THE GODFATHER as something of an art film, something distinctly atypical of American movies of the 1970s and even more atypical of American movies as they exist today.<br /><br />Many critics regard THE GODFATHER as the single finest crime film ever made.  I would not go quite that far--I think the 1974 CHINATOWN and the 1990 GOODFELLAS equal it.  Many critics regard it as the second best American film overall, following closely behind the 1941 CITIZEN KANE.  Again, I would not go quite that far; there are many, many films that vie for the title of "best," too many for anyone's designation to be more than trivial opinion.  Even so, I think it is entirely safe to say that THE GODFATHER, the film that was originally shown on 1972 screens, has stood the test of time--and will go on doing so for as long as motion pictures are shown.  The 2006 Paramount DVD contains nothing in the way of bonus material, and if you want that you'll have to go to a boxed set or some other incarnation of the film.  But THE GODFATHER is good enough to stand on its own without the support of bonus material.  In the end, it is the film that counts, and THE GODFATHER is indeed a truly great one.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer<br />In Memory of Roscoe, Faithful Companion, 1999-2011</p></body></html>

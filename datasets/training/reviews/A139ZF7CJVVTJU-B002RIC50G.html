Unlike <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNJV">Batman Begins</a>, which can and does stand apart from its batty bretheren, this film's punch relies in many ways on the Lecter mythos, much to its detriment.<br /><br />I suppose you could attempt to view the movie as an isolated incident, a self-contained story, but that would be both wrong-headed and, for anyone who knows anything about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LP6KNU">The Silence of the Lambs</a>, virtually impossible.  Besides, even if you could take away expectations and biases from the viewing experience, you still end up with a pretty watered down treatise on what makes a monster.<br /><br />Much like Showtime's deliciously dark series <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6GUW0">Dexter</a>, "Hannibal Rising" hopes to show us how serial killers are born.  Their answers aren't that different: a mind-boggingly horrific childhood experience combined with the tutelage of a fighting/killing master.  Dexter's seemed a bit more plausible -- he was adopted by a police officer who sagely tried to channel Dexter's murderous tendencies into more productive veins; Hannibal, on the other hand, is taken under the wing of his obscenely wealthy Aunt, Lady Murasaki, a sexy Japanese immigrant who teaches Hannibal the arts of sword play and flower arranging and why it's okay to make out with your aunt if she's only a relative by marriage.  Also, her chef gives Hannibal lots of great cooking advice.  "The cheeks are the best part of an animal!"  Hannibal does not have to ask which cheeks the chef is talking about; I would've.<br /><br />Hannibal's childhood trauma involves the grisly death of his sister at the hands of war profiteering Lithuanians.  The rest of the movie follows Hannibal as he exacts his vengance on these men, who are still pretty bad guys.  I don't want to give away the ending, but I will say this: it's a prequel, so if you're guessing that Hannibal gets away scott free, you're on the right track.<br /><br />Under normal circumstances, I'd be compelled to give a movie like this three stars instead of two, but "Hannibal Rising" does such a thorough job of squeezing all of the sick mystery out of the character of Lecter that I found the whole experience rather patronizing.  Part of what makes Lecter such a fabulous anti-hero is that he is essentially unknowable.  The darkest and most disturbing element of his personality isn't his amazing intelligence, his erudite charm, or his transcedentally creepy calm.  It is the fact that his reasons are his own to know, and only for us to guess at.<br /><br />"Hannibal Rising" not only removes the mystique from the man, but it also reduces his actions to those of sullen kid.  Hannibal is not the anti-hero in this movie; he's the actual, legitimate hero, and the label doesn't suit the character, at least not as he's ever been portrayed in any other film.  It turns him into a puppet that's holding its own strings.  Even worse, the film insultingly holds the audiences hands through some of its weightier images.  When Hannibal passes through an open-air butcher market or when he sees a bracelet that his sister used to wear, we are treated to flashbacks of Hannibal's last moments with his sister, as if we can't already guess on our own the connections to be made.<br /><br />The closest thing to Foster's Clarice here is Inspector Popil, a man smart enough to know that Hannibal is responsible for the sudden outbreak of beheadings and cheek eatings.  The victim of his own fair share of war crimes, Popil even sympathizes with what makes Hannibal kill, but he has, of course, chosen the path of law and order.  Hannibal respected Clarice's weaknesses as they could be found in the virtues she chose to valiantly uphold.  That respect is missing here, and so the character of Popil remains woefully unused, his status relegated to that of a narrative mouthpiece.  "That young boy died out there with his sister," Popil says.  "What came out of that woods was no longer human.  It was ... a monster!"<br /><br />If you say so.  Gaspard Ulliel's portrayal of Hannibal does have hints of "monster" about it, but it lacks depth and coherency.  He spends much of the movie grinning quietly and looking at people out of the corners of his eyes.  It's all well and good, I suppose, but you'll get the impression that something's missing.  What's missing is the uncertainty, the creepiness, the indefinable menace that made the man such a great character.  It's been said that we hate most the things we understand most; Hannibal's not hard to figure out in this film.  I guess it's fair to say that that doesn't necessarily make it a hate-worthy film, but it does make it boring.</p></body></html>

A lot of the action is rather clich&eacute;, the humor is okay (not hilarious, but who can resist humping monkeys?), and the plot is rather thin.  But with these things in mind, it still turns out to be an entertaining movie.<br /><br />If you like The Rock and the other movies he has done then you can't go wrong with this movie.  If you like anything staring Steven Segal, Jean Claude Van Dam, or the earlier works of Sly Stalone then this movie will be up your alley.  If these type of things turn you off then avoid this movie like the plague.</p></body></html>

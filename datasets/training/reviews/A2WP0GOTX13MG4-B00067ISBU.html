Ron Perlman takes up the role of Hellboy and dons the horns, tale, lots of red makeup, a mean rock solid right arm, and a great wit. Unfortunately, Perlman's character is one of the few things done &quot;just right&quot; in this movie.<br /><br /> I'm not familiar with the comic book, but I'm told this movie adaptation is fairly faithful to it. It certainly has the feel of a movie adapted from the comics. Hellboy's appearance is straight of a comic (and it is kind of funny how there is a Hellboy comic book that is referenced a few times in the movie). A few of the action scenes have the over the top style action (big swings, bodies flying from impact, etc.) found in the pages of a comic. So, it at least has the feel right.<br /><br /> Where the movie suffers is that it falls just between either being too long or not long enough. There are four or five key characters, and outside of Hellboy, most of them were not developed well enough. Some back story is given on each in the way of exposition or flashback, but the emotional or mental bagage the characters carry is never really fleshed out or resolved. One gets the feeling that Rupert Evans' character, John Myers, should have had a bigger role. All we know is that he is to be Hellboy's new guardian of sorts, but we don't really get to know him. Similar remarks could be made about some of the other characters. Perhaps by making the moview longer, we could have gotten to know the characters better. Or, if some of the characters had been excised from the film, the rest would have had a more substantial role to play.<br /><br /> Hellboy and his companions are frequently employed to hunt down monsters from gothic lore and the occult. They work for the Bureau of Paranormal Investigations (or something like that). Besides Rasputin, none of the monsters or figures they go after in this film are familiar to the casual viewer. The movie probably would have been better served by using better known villains, or by developing the story behind the villains and what they were trying to accomplish a little better. For instance, Rasputin has a blonde femme fatale henchman, er henchwoman. It is never quite clear what role she serves.<br /><br /> Comic book fans should be pleased with this movie. Those that aren't as familiar with comics or the occult (which figures prominently in this 'Men in Black,' 'Ghostbusters,' 'Van Helsing' style movie) probably won't enjoy it much. Its good for a viewing or two, and the DVD is loaded with special features on two discs. I'd give it a limited recommendation.</p></body></html>

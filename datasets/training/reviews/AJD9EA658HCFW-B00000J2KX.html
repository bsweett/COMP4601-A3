<meta name="summary" content="Very complex plot"></head><body><p>"The Shinning" is a strange kind a film. After watching "One flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" I had high expectations for "The Shining". I am also a fan of Jack Nicholson.<br /><br />"The Shinning" is about writer Jack Torrance. He is a husband and father. One day he gets an offer at the Overlook Hotel being the winder caretaker. The reason he wants this job is because he is a writer and this hotel he will be working at is huge and isolated at night, so he can focus on his writing. While writing he would have frequent outburst when he was interrupted and having a hard time starting. His son has the gift of Extrasensory perception. Before they even move into the hotel, he has a vision of his father chasing him with an axe.<br /><br />"The Shinning" has a very complex and confusing plot line that actually takes away from the rest of the film. I think part of the reason why the plot is so complex is because "The Shinning" is based off the novel by Stephen King.<br /><br />Overall, "The Shinning" has good acting by Jack Nicholson. He is the reason why the film earns 4 stars. The plot is also good, but I think this is the case where the book is better then the film. I say this because I'm sure that in the book Stephen King can do a lot more explaining of the story.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Don't go to an island full of crazies, without backup"></head><body><p>Nicolas Cage just didn't stand a chance once he landed on that island (Summersisle) off Washington State, full of wackos. I just tried to think how he was going to overcome all those "forces" against him, but to no avail. This movie does not have a happy ending. Unlike a lot of other horror movies, the hero just doesn't survive this one. If you're the type who roots for the "good guy(s)" in horror movies, this one isn't for you. Cage, as police officer Edward Malus is out of his league (an in definite need of a SWAT team) against this island of matriarchal pagan zealots; in the search for his missing daughter.</p></body></html>

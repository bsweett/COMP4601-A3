Either viewers loved or hated it. I cannot understand the hate.<br /><br />First of all, this was a typical Stephen Sommers film - you take a film classic and remake it with sarcasm, better effects, and you poke fun at the campiness of it all. Apparently some people were expecting something more Gothic, or serious, or historically accurate. Well, guess what? That has been done to death - no pun intended. What Sommers does here is far more entertaining: he takes these great characters of European Folklore, and he attempts create a nineteenth century world where they actually live, and attempt to intermingle with civilization. It's an amusing concept, or like Dracula says "Why can't people just leave us alone? We never kill more than our share!" I think, actually, the humor in this film and its actual folkloric parallels may have been over the heads of many viewers. Based on the reviews, those that hated it obviously did not understand or grasp the humor. I do feel that this film presents the best performance of a Dracula character. No, he is not a brooding Gothic figure; rather he is an egotistical, sarcastic, obviously flawed individual whose eternal life in the dark fog of Transylvania is beginning to get to him.<br /><br />Bravo to Richard Roxburgh for his treatment of this character! Anyway, if you enjoy a higher-developed dry sense of humor coupled with parodies of folklore (or have any back ground in the actual myths regarding the characters of this film) then you will truly enjoy this film. Mind you, the action scenes stretch the bounds of reality, but then again, so does the existence of a were-wolf, or the Frankenstein Monster.<br /><br />I do enjoy the exchange between Dracula and the were-wolf, who in the form of a man is a noble chivalrous soul, and upon hearing of Dracula's plans declares that he would "rather die!" Dracula's response? "Oh, don't be boring. Everyone who says that dies." If you like vampire-monster movies, you need to add this to your movie collection! Enjoy!!!</p></body></html>

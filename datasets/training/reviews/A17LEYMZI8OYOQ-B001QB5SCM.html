<meta name="summary" content="Diaz, Collette & MacLaine"></head><body><p>Beautifully adapted by Susannah Grant from the novel by Jennifer Weiner, exquisitely directed by Curtis Hanson and played to perfection by Cameron Diaz, Toni Collette, Shirley MacLaine and a hand-picked cast, this overlooked family comedy was one of the very best films of 2005.<br /><br />Collette and Diaz are sisters, living in Philadelphia.  Toni is a responsible attorney with a low self-image when it comes to men, while Cameron is a flaky, flirty, uneducated party girl who detests work and leaches off of her sister.  The girls have a major falling out when Toni discovers Cameron in bed with her (Toni's) boy friend.<br /><br />Out on the street, Cameron discovers that she has a long lost grandmother (MacLaine) living in a Florida retirement community, so she heads South, figuring that she'll mooch off the old lady for awhile.<br /><br />Shirley, however, is not that easily taken in and she forces her newly-found granddaughter to not only turn her life around, but also effects a reconciliation with her sister.<br /><br />IN HER SHOES is a joyful, very  human film; one that can be enjoyed over multiple viewings.  The supporting cast includes Mark Feuerstein as Toni's fiance', Ken Howard as her and Cameron's father, and Norman Lloyd as an ailing college professor who touches Cameron's heart.<br /><br />The above average "Behind the Scenes" featurettes include one about the Florida seniors who played small roles in the movie and another about how a dog was saved from the pound to play a key part in the film.<br /><br />?

<meta name="summary" content="Cool Movie, Bad DVD"></head><body><p>This was one of my favorite movies to come out of the Hollywood Vietnam Movie Period (Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Hamburger Hill).  I was disappointed by the DVD however.  First of all the sound was in mono and the picture was Pan and Scan for the most part.  I would give the movie 5 stars, but I give the DVD 1 star.  So I guess it averages out to 3.</p></body></html>

Have you ever seen almost any 80's movie put out by the Canon Group? Then you've seen "The Punisher". I am not one to give away spoilers to movies, but this movie is just so full of action-genre cliches it's impossible not to see what's coming miles off. The good-cop-ready-to-retire who crosses the wrong bad guy on his last assignment, cue bad guys offing cop's family, cop's partner, cop's friend, cop's boss or anyone else that would turn the good cop into a vengeance-minded lone wolf seeking vigilante justice. Yes, this formula has been used from "Mad Max" to "Lethal Weapon" to "Death Wish" to "Bloodsport" to "No Holds Barred" (I mean really, anything that resembles a Hulk Hogan movie to any degree deserves 2 stars or less). There is nothing here that you won't find done as well in any Chuck-Norris-Jean-Claude-Charles-Bronson movie. The movie is very long too, and Travolta hamming it up for two hours is tough to take. I guess if you are a fan of the comic you might like it, or if you have happened to live in a cave for the past decade or two and have never seen this type of film before you might like it, but for those of us who grew up Stallone's "Cobra" or Eastwood's "Dirty Harry", this is just a retread of the same old story.</p></body></html>

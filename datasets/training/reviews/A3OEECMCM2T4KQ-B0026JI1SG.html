<meta name="summary" content="Another Powerful Masterpiece from Eastwood"></head><body><p>Deserving of all the accolades it has received, Million Dollar Baby stands out and rises above many films made in the last five years. What makes this film so good? I believe it is the perfect combination of a superb script by Paul Haggis, the vision and skill of the director, Clint Eastwood, and the stellar performances from the entire cast, particularly Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman. One other ingredient that turns this picture from a great one to a masterpiece, is its honesty, a pure truthfulness in the narrative, a real tragedy that long after the last credit rolls, the images and themes remain lodged in your memory.<br /><br />Hillary Swanks performance is really beyond any criticism. Her portrayal of Fitzgerald, the humble girl from hillbilly country, persisting to attain her dream as a prize-winning boxer, is inspiring; because of her utter lack of ego and pretension. Without giving anything away, her performance at the end of the film was extremely realistic and incredibly moving on many levels. In the end, the character of Fitzgerald is that type of woman you'd like to meet and know - a good person.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman has to be one of the best narrator's in the history of the cinema. One of his most memorable voice-overs was in one of my favourite films, The Shaw shank Redemption. In Million Dollar Baby, his narration carries the film and possesses that same resonance as Redemption. Freeman's character, again, was totally without pretence, a kind man and a friend we'd all like to have in our lives.<br /><br />Eastwood's transformation from the hard-hearted boxing trainer to a sensitive man is a subtle one but ultimately believable. The character's daughter has disowned him, as he continues for years to write her letters to only get them back as Return to Sender. This rejected love from his real daughter transfers to Fitzgerald as she remarks at the end of the film how he reminds her of her real father. They have a relationship that develops profoundly by the film's end.<br /><br />In fact all the performances have this aspect in common, an unpretentious realism, understated and subtle.<br /><br />Most of Eastwood's films including Mystic River, The Unforgiven and even Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, have that feeling of quality about them, something old Hollywood, something very credible and satisfying. As a cinematic storyteller, Eastwood is one of our best.<br /><br />Million Dollar Baby is a masterpiece and defies any real criticisms: a work of pure art.<br /><br />An easy five star rating.</p></body></html>

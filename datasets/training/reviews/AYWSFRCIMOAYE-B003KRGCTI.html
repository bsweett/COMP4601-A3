<meta name="summary" content="Mad Max + Bible + Questionable logic"></head><body><p>- It's like Mad Max plus Bible<br /><br />- The action scenes are laughable.<br /><br />- The logic is questionable. For example, Eli, the main character is blind  but he fought off all the bad guys with his gun and fists! He was shot point-blank but still survived!<br /><br />- After watching it, I found my curiosity was satifisfied but I did not feel entertanined.</p></body></html>

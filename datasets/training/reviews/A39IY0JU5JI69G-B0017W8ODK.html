<meta name="summary" content="Fascinating story, beautifully brought to screen"></head><body><p>I started the book quite a while ago and dropped it after about the first third, mostly because I couldn't relate to any of the characters.  Full disclosure;  I listened on the audio version, usually while driving so it's possible that if I had read the actual "book" I might have enjoyed it more.  I think that part of my problem was the class thing--the characters seemed so snobby and over-privileged, especially the two sisters, that I had a hard time caring about them.<br /><br />So, in my case anyway, the film overcame that problem instantly by its gorgeous visuals.  From the first scene of the abundant greenery surrounding the huge country  home, I was taken in.  Then the casting---the stunning Keira Knightly and the hunky-but-sensitive James McAvoy--overcame any resistance I'd had to these characters.<br /><br />Of course the theme of the story is atonement and we are given a fascinating tale of how the words of a 13 year old girl lead to the destruction of the two people she most loves.  It's interesting to read the reviews of the film, here, and also of the book, to analyze Briony, the 13 year old.  Many reviewers see her as an evil child who deliberately lied about the crime due to her spurned crush on Robbie.  A few see Briony in a more charitable light--that of a spoiled and neglected younger child who lives in the world of her imagination so strongly that she may not realize her own mistake.  Some see her action as trying to protect Cecilia from Robbie, who, by that point, has become a monster in her eyes.<br /><br />What I see as a weakness in the film is the lack of the family background which would present Briony's action in a more understandable way.  Reviews of the book are more charitable to Briony than the film reviewers because of this lack of information, I think.  The book tells us that this is highly dysfunctional family; the father is frequently away with his mistress, leaving the mother suffering from incapacitating migraines.  Her consolation seems to lie in her children and she spoils the young Briony giving her delusions of grandeur for her literary ability.  The father has taken a liking to Robbie, the son of the servant, because he has motivation for academic success that his own son, Leon, lacks.  When Robbie outperforms Leon at University, this is a cause for the mother to dislike him, which lays the groundwork for the ensuing tragedy.  The alleged victim of the crime keeps still and allows an innocent man to go to prison, as does the real perpetrator.  The class system, itself, undoubtably plays a part in the injustice.  In my mind, there is plenty of blame to go around.<br /><br />There is a question of whether Briony deliberately and knowingly lied or if she was a victim of her own innocence,need for approval and genuine shock at the sexual scenario and honestly misunderstood what happened. As another reviewer of the book wrote, even Cecilia could have done more to discover the truth by questioning Briony and Lola, but she,too,was stuck in her own misperceptions.<br /><br />The book, too, gives more of the background of Lola, who is suffering from the fact that her parents are being divorced.  This makes her more than a willing party to the sexual advances of the chocolate king which are later interpreted as a crime. Indeed she later marries him.  The book gives such a thorough background of the whole family that it is an accident waiting to happen.  And on the hottest day of the summer, it does.<br /><br />The film, however, treats this as Briony's crime and we follow her as she matures and gradually realizes the seriousness of the consequences of her action.  We are given some graphic views of the war, which some people think are not necessary to the story.  My feeling is that in seeing the depth of Robbie's suffering, we feel the tragedy that this lie has brought about.<br />Perhaps another screenwriter might have given us more of the psychological background of the family and less of the sheer physical horror of war and this might have made for a more satisfying story...who knows?<br /><br />The ending is problemmatic for many viewers, as well as for the readers of the book.  As I watched the film, I bought into the idea of the elder Briony atoning for her "crime" as well as she could by re-writing the story of Robbie and Cecilia, giving them, as an act of "kindness, the time together that they deserved. One can speculate on the nature of art and the role of the writer in portraying reality but I won't bother here.<br /><br />I did feel that this ending was satisfying in an intellectual way but that it was thin soup emotionally.  The huge suffering that we saw built up a huge expectation of something equally great to wind up the story and this little performance by the elder writer in a tv interview really didn't do it for me.<br /><br />In sum, this is a wonderful film and certainly worth seeing.  Whether it completely works is my question, but it certainly brings up some fascinating and important questions.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Creepy Creeper Creeps Us Out..."></head><body><p>Trish (Gina Phillips) and her brother Darry (Justin Long) are on their way home from school in Trish's old car. On a long, lonely stretch of highway, they encounter a maniac driving a suped up truck that's as fast as a rocket-sled! Said maniac keeps crashing into the rear of their car and zooms off around them and into the distance. While still recovering from this experience, Trish and Darry see this guy loading what appear to be bodies (wrapped in bloody sheets) down a pipe by an old abandoned church. Of course, they simply MUST investigate or there wouldn't be much of a movie now would there? So, when the big guy leaves, they go to the pipe, where Darry hears what sounds like a faint human moan. He scoots into the pipe, only to fall in and down into the damp darkness below! Once there, Darry discovers not only a poor dying kid with a stitched-up chest, but also an entire ceiling covered with hundreds of well-preserved victims of the madman in the truck! This is no ordinary stalker / slasher story after all. Darry, now in shock, staggers up and out through the church and Trish drives them to a diner to call the police. It just gets creepier from there. A psychic calls them at the diner with information she couldn't possibly have. The cops arrive, while outside, the "creeper" has gone through Darry's dirty laundry, getting his scent. The creeper is one of the better movie monsters (nope, he ain't human) I've seen over the years. He'll definitely stick in your head! Cops have no hope against him / it as he comes for what he needs / wants from Darry. The beginning is a lot like Spielberg's "Duel" in it's relentless chase between car and truck. The unveiling of the creeper's cathedral of death reminded me of the discovery of the queen's egg-chamber in "Aliens" or the livingroom scene in the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", shocking and disturbing. Also, there's a scene at the police station that reminded me of Arnold's infamous "I'll be Back!" sequence in "The Terminator". I don't consider these ripoffs. I call them tributes. JEEPERS CREEPERS is one of the best horror movies I've seen in years. It's certainly better than most of the lame "Scream"-ish clones floating around. Great acting, eerie situations, a scary monster, and a continual sense of dread should be enough for any fan of this type of spook-fest...</p></body></html>

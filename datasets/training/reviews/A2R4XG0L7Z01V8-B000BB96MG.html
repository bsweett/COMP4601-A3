<meta name="summary" content="Burton went OTT with special effects"></head><body><p>I loved the book when I was young, but never really got into the sequel, about the glass elevator. I don't ever remember watching the original with Gene Wilder - but then I don't remember ever watching the original Oliver, but I used to have it taped off the TV, so I guess I must have watched it at some point. It's probably the same for the original.<br /><br />Steve Martin, Robin Williams, Christopher Walken, Nicolas Cage, Will Smith, Brad Pitt, Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler and Michael Keaton were all considered for the role of Willy Wonka. Marilyn Manson also badly wanted the part. I could quite imagine Marilyn Manson in the part actually, but there's something not quite right about Johnny Depp in this. I dunno what it was. Maybe it was because he's not in the least bit attractive in this (you'd have to be of a sick mind to find THAT attractive), or maybe it just didn't work. Tim Burton & Johnny Depp made a pretty good team in other movies, but just not in this one. I think they failed.<br /><br />Also, there was way too many special effects. Not something you would normally complain about, but basically, Tim used every effect in the book. And it's just too glossy in the end. The Oompa-Loompas are very weird also, and the songs were slightly nauseating.<br /><br />However, I did like Freddie Highmore in this - hopefully he won't turn out to be a precocious child actor. I also liked the fact we got a brief glimpse into Willy Wonka's childhood, and how he came to be the master of chocolate. It was quite interesting, but the brace was a little freaky - but apparently, that was taken from Tim's childhood.<br /><br />Also, I loved how the grandparents were brought to life, all those years ago when I first read the book. They were exactly how I imagined them, and it was fabulous.<br /><br />I think the glass elevator was incorporated into this, simply so there wouldn't be a sequel. I'm hoping so anyway, but as I say, I can't remember much of the sequel, because I couldn't get into it. Some of the buttons on the glass elevator say: Incompetent Fools; T-Bone Steak Jell-O; Secretarial Poodles; Cocoa Cats; Mechanical Clouds; Stars in their Pies; Nice Plums; Up And Out; Fragile Egos; Black Box of Frogs; Weird Lollipops; Mighty Jam Monitor; Creative Dog Flip; Elastic Forest; Leaky Canes; Dessert Island; People Poo; Pie Cream; Spewed Vegetables; Naffy Taffy; Lickety Split Peas; Honeycombs and Brushes and Old Sneezes and Smells Dept.<br /><br />It was very faithful to the book, although I think, if I can remember correctly (it has been quite a few years), the ending is a little bit different, as that bit was all new to me.<br /><br />I'm still not sure about Johnny's portrayal of Willy Wonka, it's quite disturbing actually. But I won't let that distract me from an alright film. It was nothing special really, and the OTT special effects, could have been toned down.</p></body></html>

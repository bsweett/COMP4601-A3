<meta name="summary" content="Kiss Kiss Bang Bang shatters film archetypes and the fourth wall"></head><body><p>Shane Black's "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" is about as profound as its title - this is pure pulp entertainment, a sloppy, tasty concoction of violence, sex and humor wrapped up in a big old tortilla of wit.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. may not be able to carry a major Hollywood film by himself (see, "Chaplin"), but there are few actors better suited for colorful roles in independent films.  I always enjoy Downey, but my favorite performance of his came in Curtis Hanson's "Wonder Boys."  Effortlessly downplaying his manic energy, Downey more than held his own with stellar actors like Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, and Francis MacDormand.<br /><br />In "KKBB," Downey plays a perfect Downey character, Harry Lockhart.  Lockhart is a small-time hood in Baltimore who stumbles into Hollywood in the most unlikely of coincidences.  Once in Hollywood, Lockhart is completely outmatched - he's the kind of guy who stands up for a woman's virtue and gives a couple of good quips, but still gets his head beaten in by the offending cad.<br /><br />But Lockhart never stops trying, even if he's not exactly sure what is going on.  In a plot inspired by the trashiest of pulp fiction, immortalized by the "Johnny Gossamer" novels featured in the movie itself, Lockhart finds himself immersed in two investigations involving murder, incest, and good old fashioned cash.<br /><br />Lockhart also forms a twisted Mod Squad for the new millenium with Gay Perry (Val Kilmer, apparently on the Alec Baldwin diet) and childhood crush Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan).  As these three semi-intrepid souls dig deeper into these mysteries, Lockhart also serves as the Narrator, giving the audience plenty of information and laughs at the same time.<br /><br />Ultimately, "KKBB" is too witty to be a great movie - the suspension of disbelief cannot be sustained thanks to both Lockhart's narration (he insists on reminding you that you're watching a movie) and some incredibly contrived set pieces.  That doesn't mean that "KKBB" is not entertaining - far from it - but it does keep the movie from getting that coveted fifth star.<br /><br />Destined to become a cult hit, "KKBB" is a must for fans of trashy movies.  Straight from the Quentin Tarantino school, this is a movie to be enjoyed with good friends, greasy food, and cheap alcohol.  We need movies like that.</p></body></html>

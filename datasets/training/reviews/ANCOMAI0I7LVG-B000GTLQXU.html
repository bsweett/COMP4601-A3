It is raw and earthy and stunning to watch.  It never grows tired, it remains deep and challenging in parts and it rises above the restraints of the genre with a slew of deeply settled performances that are rooted in actual character progression.<br /><br />This 2006 remake has some nice CGI.<br /><br />Sadly, that is all that exists here.  There was no need for this other than to show off some great special effects, and it does that to a degree (I found the waves in A Perfect Storm much grander, to be honest).  The problem here is that there is no depth of story, and the script is so preposterous that it leaves you completely baffled at the fact that this was green lit at all.  The performances are mere surface, with no heart or soul (and you need that if you are going to root for anyone here).  Richard Dreyfuss is especially repulsive here; just hard to watch (and I love him more than most, as a rule).  Like another reviewer mentioned, this film is just bland.  The characters are one-dimensional and lackluster and the obstacles in everyone's way are lazy and stupid in most parts.<br /><br />Yeah, this is a stinker.</p></body></html>

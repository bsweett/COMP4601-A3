<meta name="summary" content="Well crafted psychological thriller aimed at adults"></head><body><p>The fascinating psychological thriller "Insomnia" is a remake of an excellent Norwegian movie released about five years ago. In large part, it succeeds in improving upon the original because it fleshes out the relationship between the main character and the killer he is pursuing.<p>Detective Will Dormer [Al Pacino] and his partner are dispatched to the far reaches of Alaska to help investigate the grisly murder of a young woman. Internal Affairs has them under investigation back in Los Angeles, and their trip seems to be part of a plan to get them out of the way for awhile. With the help of local detective Ellie Burr [Hilary Swank], the investigation starts out well, but soon Dormer is plagued by insomnia triggered by the lack of darkness during the Alaskan summer. After a couple of days, fatigue sets in, and he begins to falter. The situation gets much worse after a dreadful accident occurs during a stakeout. It isn't long before the killer [Robin Williams] begins to play a deadly cat and mouse game with him. [Note: Saying who plays the killer gives almost nothing of the plot away.]<p>The cast is uniformly excellent. Director Christopher Nolan, whose last film was the highly original thriller "Memento", again takes on the tricky concept of time. In this case, Dormer's insomnia causes him to lose track of time in a palce where there is no night. In the process, he also loses track of himself. <p>"Insomnia"s main theme is moral ambiguity, and Dormer's not knowing whether it's day or night serves to underscores that theme. [Everything is relative.] This is a sophisticated thriller for adults. Its few action scenes seem almost beside the point, as if they were placed there as an afterthought to make the movie more appealing to mainstream audiences.</p></body></html>

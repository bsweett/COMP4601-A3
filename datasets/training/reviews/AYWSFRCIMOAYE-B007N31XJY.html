It deeply moved me seeing Julia struggling to raise her kids by herself and doing a good job at work. It vividly potrayed the cruelty of the corporate which knew their waste was killing people. But they arrograntly denied it.<br /><br />Julia's acting is superb. The fact that this film is based on a true story does increase its entertaining value.</p></body></html>

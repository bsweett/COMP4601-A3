<meta name="summary" content="An all-star cast with the best director around creates an outstanding movie!"></head><body><p>Sam "Ace" Rothstein (Robert De Niro) has a mind for math and he is a bookmaker wizard.  He is sent to Vegas to run the Tangiers Casino for the mob.  Within a short period of time the profits are doubled and the mafia keeps two sets of books to hide the money from the federal tax authorities.  The mafia sees a real cash maker in Sam and they send out Nicholas Santoro to protect Sam and the casino from any problems. Nicki is not to smart and a real thug and he is quickly banned from every casino in town.  That leads him and his crew into more strong arm crime and robberies. He is a real out of control gangster.<br /><br />Sam meanwhile falls in love with the beautiful Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) and they are soon married.  For multiple reasons Nicki and Sam are at each other's throats and Sam is also in trouble with the casino commissioner for firing one of his family members.  All of this action leads to more violence, betrayal and conflict......<br /><br />This is an excellent movie with an all-star cast and it is directed by Martin Scorsese who is simply one the best directors of Hollywood history.  The result is a fiery and action filled movie that depicts the history of the Las Vegas Casinos and the mafia control of gambling.  The story line is very good and with such a great cast of actors the movie just seems realistic.  There is a lot of violence and language, it is the mob after all, but it is still a very good movie.<br /><br />I enjoyed it a lot and I recommend it to you.</p></body></html>

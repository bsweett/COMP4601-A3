<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful interplay between Costner and Hurt that is damaged by some unnecessarily graphic scenes"></head><body><p>I liked the psychological and suspense aspects of this movie quite a bit.  However, I marked it down a star because there is a scene of a couple engaging in sex that is unnecessarily graphic and two scenes of murder that have more blood that your local Red Cross.  Explicit sex scenes in "mainstream" movies seem silly since our society is so saturated by porn.  Hollywood can't really compete with it (and shouldn't), and half-measures have the worst of both worlds.  They offend people like me and can't titillate those seeking porn.  I will just point you back to "North by Northwest" and the steamy sexual tension that passed between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint.  Nothing was shown but the adults had no doubt what passed between them without having to shove anything in anyone's face.  As for the gore in this film, well, it just spoils the psychological elegance the suspense has put in place.  Remember "Jaws" worked well because we rarely saw the shark!<br /><br />What is best about the film is the way Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) and his psychopathic alter ego Marshall (William Hurt) work together, talk to each other, and struggle against each other as Earl continues his career as a serial murderer while trying to resist it (by going to AA meetings).  Dane Cook plays a Mr. Smith who becomes aware of who Earl really is behind his Citizen of the Year reputation and tries to blackmail him into allowing him to participate in a murder.<br /><br />We also have Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) who is a millionaire heiress nutjob who has decided to be a cop to work out her issues with her dead father.  She is also trying to work through a divorce (she picks men poorly, too) from a boytoy who wants millions to go away and she doesn't want to give it.  She is bent on solving the "thumbprint" murders and begins closing in on Earl Brooks.  However, she also has to look out for an escaped prisoner who is determined to kill her for putting him away in the first place.<br /><br />On top of all this we have Earl's home life.  He is a rich businessman with a wonderful wife, Emma (Marg Helgenberger), and a troubled daughter, Jane (Danielle Panabaker) who has dropped out of her freshman year of college for reasons beyond what she is willing to admit to her parents.<br /><br />How all this mixes together and comes to a head is quite entertaining, at least as entertaining as serial murder can get.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI</p></body></html>

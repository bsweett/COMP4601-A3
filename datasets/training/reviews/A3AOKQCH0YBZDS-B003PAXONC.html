<meta name="summary" content="Science Fiction Thriller"></head><body><p>The basic premise of this movie is that a virus is unleashed and most of the population on Earth is killed off.<br /><br />Some people do survive because they have a natural immunity to the virus, while many others without a natural immunity to the virus become infected by so called "Dark Seekers", whom are mutant vampire like creatures that only come out at night & attack those that aren't infected.<br /><br />Will Smith carries the movie and is the primary actor in about 90% of "I Am Legend". Smith does a good acting job and plays the part of a military research scientist trying to find a cure/vaccine for the virus to help save others. Smith's character does find a cure for the virus and dies protecting the cure for the virus, hence becoming a legend for the remaining survivors.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A hard movie to watch more than once"></head><body><p>Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a well acted and scripted story, but you might find it hard to ever watch again due to it's depressing nature (worth a rental for sure). The cast is very good across the board, with Philip Seymour Hoffman being the absolute standout. I'm really surprised he got an Oscar nomination for Charlie Wilson's War instead of this movie, though he was good in that one as well. The storyline does jump back and forth quite a bit, but not in a confusing way. I really just liked how one simple plan turned into something sinister that just kept getting worse and worse until the fitting end.</p></body></html>

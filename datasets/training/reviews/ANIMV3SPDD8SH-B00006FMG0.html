<meta name="summary" content="DAD, CAN I BORROW THE MACHINE GUN?"></head><body><p>I am bewildered by the unanimous positive critical response to this movie. It's "The Godfather" meets "Father Knows Best" with a virtual bloodbath of gangster executions warmed over by a "Dad, can we have a man to man talk" mentality. The director screams "PERIOD PIECE!" with exquisitely manicured 1930s set designs that upstage the crummy little story of a boy being taken under the wing of his viscious but kindly gangster father. Jude Law playing a profiteering hitman/photographer is the only redemption here, his deranged characterization is the true spirit of this movie. I would have much preferred watching his life story for over two hours.</p></body></html>

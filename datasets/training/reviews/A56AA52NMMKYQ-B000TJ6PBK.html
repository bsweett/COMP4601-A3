John Cusack does a credible job as the protagonist Mike Enslin, a cynical writer of non-fiction books who visits allegedly spooky places to debunk their claims of ghostly specters.  Against the advice of the hotel manager (Samuel L. Jackson), Enslin visits a supposedly haunted room in the Dolphin Hotel in New York City, insisting on staying in Room 1408, the locus of many a tragic event.  He finds that painful memories flood his mind as he descends progressively into the grip of the hotel's malevolent power.  The special effects are spooky and just short of over the top.<br /><br />Some viewers may criticize the film's lack of realism, most notably the ability of anyone other than a rock star or royalty to get a hotel room this large in New York City.  More likely you get a room so small that you have to step outside just to change your mind.  But what can you expect for a mere $617.00 a night in Gotham, the City that Never Sleeps?<br /><br />Or talk about scary -- $12 for a 4-oz. tin of honey roasted peanuts in the Honor Bar?  Frightening!!<br /><br />1408 is an effective fright charge likely to ignite shudders for those who like spooky movies, almost as scary as trying to find an economical hotel room in NYC!!!</p></body></html>

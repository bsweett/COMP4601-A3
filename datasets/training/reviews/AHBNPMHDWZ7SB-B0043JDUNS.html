I say "kind of", instead of just plain "wrong", because, while there are scenes devoted to that agenda, the focus is still definitely Tony Stark and the Iron Man "weapon". Robert Downey Jr. returns to the role that reinvigorated his career, and he's better than ever. RDJ's portrayal is possibly the most spot-on comic book character that I have seen come to life off of a page. Yes, Heath Ledger's Joker is still the best, but his Tony Stark is a very close second. As for the rest of the performances, they ranged from adequate to great. I never understood why people doubted Don Cheadle replacing Terrence as Rhodey/War Machine from the start. I never did, and he did just what I expected him to. He didn't overact, he didn't steal the show (although I doubt that's possible when your co-start is RDJ), and his voice fit the commanding character that I felt Rhodey's should have been in the first place. Don't get me wrong, I like Terrence Howard in particular roles, but not as Rhodey. I felt his talent was misplaced. And don't get me started on Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman/Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Yeah, she's triple covert, and oh my god. That's all I need to say. (wipes drool from mouth). Gwyneth Paltrow returns from the first film, and she's just as quirky. She and RDJ play off of each other very well. That's definitely a dynamic that I enjoy revisiting these films to see.<br /><br />Now Sam Jackson just so happens to be my favorite actor, due to his natural cool guy persona. Him being in this universe is enough for me to be giddy about, yet alone playing such a pivotal role in the Avengers Initiative. While he didn't have a lot of screen time as Nick Fury, I still feel like he still did a great job at capturing the character from Mark Millar's The Ultimates. Ironically, Millar's updated, black Nick Fury was based on Sam Jackson's likeness before he even knew. I feel like I would be doing this guy a disservice if I didn't at least mention Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson. He has actually grown on me as a character after seeing him in almost every film in the quasi-series. Now for the villains. I love Iron Man, and Jeff Bridges. While I thought he made a great corporate villain, something about him being inside of the Iron Monger suit rubbed me the wrong way. I just never really believed it, but it got the job done. Fast forward to Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke. Rockwell's Justin Hammer was played more for humor, and the jokes often fell flat. He was still a little funny, and I probably wouldn't be able to chose anyone else for his roles but he just didn't serve as the comic relief that he was intended to be. He reminded me of a skinny version of Austin Powers, except he couldn't fight. That's probably not much of an insult coming from me, because I'm skinny, but I'd like to think I can defend myself. It's not even as if the film needed any more comic relief. Tony Stark was the funniest one in it, and his interactions with Pepper, and Rhodey, have enough to supply the laughs. I was waiting to see Hammer get his due because I loved his character, but that didn't happen in this movie. Perhaps he'll be one of the villains again in the third installment.<br /><br />Now for the main villain, played by Mickey Rourke. Rourke rounds out the all-star cast as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash, if that's what you want to call him. Don't get me wrong, he was Whiplash, in essence, but if you've never picked up an Iron Man comic before (or watched the cartoon from the 90's), you'd only know him as Ivan Vanko. He was a more fearsome adversary than Jeff Bridges as Iron Monger. His badassedness was not displayed quite as much as I had hoped, but you still got the message that he was not to be messed with, a few times. I genuinely felt for his character at first, because his father didn't deserve to live, and die, the way he was forced to, after working with Howard Stark to design the very arc reactor that powered the Iron Man suit, and kept Tony alive. It was his choice of handling that situation that drives you to loathe him. Rourke played him a bit cartooney, but he still did a fine job, even if you can't always understand the Russian accent. Sadly, his final showdown with War Machine and Iron Man is so short that you will miss it if you blink. To be fair, the finale in Iron Man 2 still pissed on the finale in the first one. My only complaint about Iron Man is the lack of a decent final fight. That rooftop/street showdown was very anticlimactic, so I was looking forward to Jon Favreau upping the ante for the sequel. He definitely did, and it wreaks havoc on your sound system. Wow. Window shattering, neighbor waking stuff. Even though I said that the movie did not spend too much time pushing the Avengers into existence, it was still very there. Front and center, to be honest, but never overbearing, like it has been made out to be. There were a few nicely placed little easter eggs that very clearly winked at us fans of the Marvel Universe.<br /><br />One golden nugget (or red, white, and blue, to be exact) actually made me laugh with excitement for what has now become my second favorite Marvel Studios production, after the first Iron Man. That would be Captain America: The First Avenger. Overall, the film was pretty funny. More humorous than anything else, but that's not to say that the action was not impressive. It was definitely good stuff, but this movie still didn't meet my expectations, as far as the hype that was built around it. It's surprising that this all-star cast could not elevate this sequel about its predecessor. I would rank it on the lower side of Marvel Studios' filmography, but still fairly high in comparison to your average comic book movies. My ranking thus far (pre-Avengers) is: (1) Iron Man, (2) Captain America: The First Avenger, (3) The Incredible Hulk (which really needs a sequel, by the way, whether it be with Ruffalo or Norton -- obviously Ruffalo), (4) Iron Man 2, and (5) Thor (don't let me ranking it last fool you, I really like it). Anyway, back to the film at hand. I probably loved this movie more than the average moviegoer, or film enthusiast, due to me being such a huge comic geek, and Marvel fan. But nevertheless, this is a good movie. If you were to separate it from the first film, it probably wouldn't hold up quite as well, but it would still be good. I've defended this movie from the claims that it's just an Avengers preview throughout this review, and I stand by that, but to be honest, had Favreau chosen not to put as many Avengers easter eggs and set-ups in it, it would probably stand on its own merit better. So to wrap this up, I liked it less than the original, but I still highly recommend it to fans of the Marvel U, or comic book flicks in general. If you're not into comic book films, I say rent it first.</p></body></html>

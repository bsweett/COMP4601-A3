<meta name="summary" content="a great, original suspense drama"></head><body><p>Though it shows how out of it I am, I had no idea that there was a version of this earlier than the Hollywoodization, which is also a first-rate production.  The plot is virtually identical, except for a few variations.  I am happy to say that this one is equally good and yet very different, in large part because of the actors.  Rapace plays Lisbeth as a far more vulnerable and human character when compared to the cold, ethereal Roony version; she also does not make her the kind of lithesome sex kitten that Roony does, but is simply tough, gender ambiguous, and not all that pretty.  Blomkvist is also less heroic and more human (egoistic, ambitious, not so saintly if cause-driven), indeed he looks like a real person rather than the too-perfect Craig.  Frankly, it is great fun to have 2 versions, but this one is better.<br /><br />Recommended with enthusiasm.</p></body></html>

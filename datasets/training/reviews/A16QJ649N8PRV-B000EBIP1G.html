<meta name="summary" content="Powerful and Very Well Done"></head><body><p>This movie version of the great novel is very well done.<br /><br />The C.S. Lewis books have long been favorites of mine.  They use the vehicle of fantasy to portray a spiritual message.  The film is very true to the story of the book.<br /><br />It is set during WWII and features four English children who enter a wardrobe and discover a magical world.  They are introduced to Aslan the lion, the White Witch, and many other interesting characters.  The story is full of Christian symbolism.  It is very well done and can be enjoyed by all ages.<br /><br />I highly recommend this superb story.</p></body></html>

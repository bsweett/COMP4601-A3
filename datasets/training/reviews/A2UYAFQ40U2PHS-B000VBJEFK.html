<meta name="summary" content="Slighly overrated, but overall quite good...."></head><body><p>I think this film is a tad overrated, but it's negatives are with the story and dialogue primarily.  I still enjoyed the film very much.  I've always liked most of what Pixar has done (which may surprise some of my friends here), and this film is a good addition to their catalogue.  There were a few problems, though.  I felt there was too much expository information, especially at the beginning.  Much of the dialogue (and situations) were very predictable, including the usual "the French are rude" stuff.  I didn't buy the romance between Colette and Linguini.  It felt forced, and didn't seem like it would really happen, in movie life or in real life.  The repartee between the rats seemed forced, too.<br /><br />On the good side, the film is visually immaculate.  Brad Bird does a tremendous job here, and he has a great sense of composition.  I wish I had seen it in a theater.  The animation is positively gorgeous.  The voices are very well done for the most part, and my favorite characters are Peter O'Toole's Anton Ego (great name) the critic, and Gusteau, voiced by Brad Garrett.  Many made hay of Janeane Garofalo's French accent for Colette, but I feel Garrett's is much, much better.  Garofalo's accent, while good, had a few dropouts here and there where her real voice came through.  This is not entirely her fault, as they changed her character to one with a French accent late in the production, and she did the best she could on such short notice.  Many were surprised that Garofalo managed to do an accent pretty well.  I'm not.  I've always believed in her talent.  Patton Oswalt (best known for his recurring role in The King of Queens, and one of the funnier standup comedians today) is fine as Remy, the rat who can cook.  The film has a real nice wrap up too, incorporating Gusteau's phrase that "anyone can cook", and Peter O'Toole's final speech in the film is surprisingly moving and stirring.  So, people should definitely rent this film.  It's not perfect, but it is still head and shoulders above most dreck at theaters these days....</p></body></html>

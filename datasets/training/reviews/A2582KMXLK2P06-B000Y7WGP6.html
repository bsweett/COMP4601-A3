I wasn't really interested in the fast pace or the "hurry up and force the viewers into the storyline while all kinds of confusing violence and people screaming goes on in the background" way of writing.  The actors and actresses played their parts really good, but it can't save a storyline that isn't interesting.  Plus, as another reviews mentions, it's just typical war prapaganda.  How many times are we going to see movies like this?  I've had enough of them.  All the subtitles you have to read are more trouble than they're worth.  Enough is enough.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dodgeball underdogs rule"></head><body><p>In true spirit of David vs. Goliath, Dodge ball is a play-by-the-book story about the little guys overcoming big odds and coming out on top.  Normally this kind of plot line could be a pit fall for clich&eacute;s and highly predictable setups, but thankfully this movie is in the hands of a skilled director and fronted by likable and funny performers.<br /><br />Rawson Marshall Thurber writes and directs a highly entertaining, low brow, feel good story that utilizes a game most of us played in our youth.  When I played we called it Warball, but it was generally the same.  In the movie, the plot basically follows a charismatic, likeable slacker Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaghn) who owns a lackluster gym called Average Joe's.  Financially he's in over his head, and he doesn't really care.  He's smart and capable, but unmotivated and lacks the confidence.  He's facing bankruptcy, foreclosure and a buyout from the big franchise Globo Gym, run by the feather haired, Fu-manchu sporting narcissist White Goodman (played well over the top by Ben Stiller, but certainly one of his funniest roles).  Lafleur and a misfit group of his gym members decide to enter the professional Dodge ball circuit and go to Las Vegas to win the money needed to keep their gym open.<br /><br />Enter Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor, Stiller's real life wife) as the bank rep who is pursued by Goodman but finds herself drawn to Peter.  So much so she joins his group of underachievers in the competitions, baring a softball pitch cannon of an arm.<br /><br />After a hilarious regional bout with a group a girl scout-like opponents, the group find themselves on their way to Vegas with a chance to prove themselves and win the cash.  The dodge ball bouts are definitely the highlight of the movie.  Anyone who has seen the `Terry Tate: Office Linebacker' commercials can tell the kinetic style transfers well to the big screen.  The climax features a showdown between the Globo Gym and Average Joe's.  The rest of the cast is well placed, especially role of Patches O'Houlihan played by Rip Torn, and the younger version played by Hank Azaria.  The number of cameos is impressive as well; William Shatner, Chuck Norris, Lance Armstrong, David Hasselhoff as the German teams coach and especially funny is Jason Bateman as a former Dodge ball champ turned analyst whose commentary leaves intellect at the front door.  In all, this is a feel good movie for adults, probably more directed at men, but still funny for all.  Using a childhood memory, whether good or bad, and making it funny and entertaining.  For everyone who probably wasn't very good at the game as a kid, this movie will make you believe you can be good at it as an adult.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="B-movie horror flick"></head><body><p>I can't say I was expecting much from this movie, but Wolfman disappointed. It comes across as a B-monster movie rather than something more. The focus is definitely on a monster killing people. The movie goes to pains to find odd and grotesque situations in which to disembowel a lot of people. However, this gets pretty boring. The scenes are uniformly dark and the acting dull. Simon Merrells is catatonic and Anthony Hopkins comes across as a joke. The only ray of light is Emily Blunt, who manages to look even sexier in 19th century wardrobe.</p></body></html>

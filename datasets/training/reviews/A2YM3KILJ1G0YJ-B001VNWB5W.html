<meta name="summary" content="Epic - Where the line between hero and villain becomes blurred"></head><body><p>Very rarely does a movie come out that challenges all the quintessential themes of a specific genre.  In all other comic book or graphic novel adaptations, there is a seamlessness with which the transition to film takes place.  The stories translate, the characters remain relatively untouched.  Normally, everything follows the lead of previous editions.  Prepare for that lazy, albeit typically enjoyable, method of delivery to be flipped on its head.<br /><br />The plot is almost stereotypically hero versus villain.  The bad guys come up with an ingenious plan, and the good guys eventually prevail.  Amazingly, however, the dismally dark portrayal of heroes, and the glossy veneer of villains, flips convention on its head.  In a world that has eschewed superheroes and driven them into hiding, a believable life alteration is necessary - this is NOT Superman simply putting on glasses and becoming Clark Kent.<br /><br />The casting and acting for The Watchmen is infallibly perfect.  Each character delivers the overall purpose and essence of their character with flair and subtlety.<br /><br />Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) is perfect in his role as a Batman in Dockers.  The most at peace with his forced retirement, he's old fashioned, and looks like a chemistry professor.<br /><br />Malin Akerman's Silk Spectre was a tad boring, but overall she conveyed the true meaning of the character, the sultry, cute, vulnerable superhero following in her mother's footsteps.  Carla Gugino is an aged crime-fighter who misses the old days and reminisces through her daughter.  Fans of her performance in Sin City will not be surprised by the Gugino flashback sequences in which she blisters the screens.<br /><br />The Comedian is perhaps the darkest of all heroes ever imagined.  He's vile yet he fights on the "good" side.  Completely comfortable with the "break an egg to make an omelette"-philosophy, he blurs the line between black and white, and could easily be seen as protagonist as well as sociopathic antagonist.<br /><br />Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) is a very compelling mastermind.  He believes his purpose is just, so his outward intentions do not come off as foreboding.  His choirboy looks only enforce the fact that he believes in his twisted intentions to save the world.  I'm unsure if the character's name is inspired by the poem, but the connection between each person's perception of invincibility, and eventual demise, is what creates each character's legacy.  In many ways Ozymandias could be viewed as The Comedian on a much grander scale.<br /><br />Jackie Earle Haley's performance as Rorschach is absolutely one of my favorite performances of all time.  His brutal, madman form of justice is more enjoyable than DeNiro's character in Taxi Driver, more misanthropic towards contemporary culture than Col. Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, and a better comic transformation than Ledger's Joker.  It's amazing to think that the pipsqueak from Bad News Bears could be so convincingly rugged, so disturbed.<br /><br />The one major flaw to this movie is the fact that Dr. Manhattan's digitally designed genitalia is on-screen roughly 50 times.  It's completely unnecessary and distracting.  Otherwise, I loved this movie; it's monumental, exciting, action-packed, and meaningful.  I highly recommend this movie for not only comic book fans, but anyone interested in an incredible story told through the lens of stunning cinematography.</p></body></html>

The period atmosphere is captured completely so that London of that era is beautifully rendered in low key lighting effects. The performances are all of the highest caliber, including the principal jobs by HUGH JACKMAN and CHRISTIAN BALE as magicians jealous of each other's talent.<br /><br />All the other roles are played well but it's MICHAEL CAINE in a peripheral part that stands out the most.<br /><br />There's an absorbing mystery at the heart of the tale and a plot twist that some may have guessed long before it happens, but it's the kind of film you can enjoy on a different level the second or third time.<br /><br />Summing up: Definitely worth viewing.</p></body></html>

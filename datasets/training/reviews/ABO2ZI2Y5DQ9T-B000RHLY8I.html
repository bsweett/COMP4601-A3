<meta name="summary" content="Nicholas Cage as 'Yuri' the Arms Dealer Retains its Authenticity to Otherwise Scattershot Story"></head><body><p>The theme of the film - international arms dealer -- is a very serious one, but unfortunately it was too much for writer/director Andrew Niccol. `Lord of War' claims that the content is based on the actual events, but the important thing is - What part of it?<br /><br />I believe that there is a man like Yuri, Ukrainian-born arms dealer, who finds his unexpected `gift' as gunrunner. The deadpan acting of Nicholas Cage as Yuri makes this fellow more credible than the overwritten script allows for him. Actually, the most intriguing moments of the film come when we see him as businessman whose cool and non-committal attitudes towards politics and moral are curiously attractive. Or repulsive to some of you.<br /><br />And I believe that even this so-called `Death-Merchant' can be a good father, love his wife, and care his drug-addicted brother (Jared Leto). If Andre Niccol says that he actually met the real-life arms dealers, and that he thought them nice people, there is no reason I should not believe what he says. And you will see at the same time that Yuri can sell guns right in front of the possible victims who are going to be killed, and that complexity in his characters makes him all the more intriguing.<br /><br />However, the rest of the film is overloaded with clich&eacute;d items, none of which have a ring of truth. How many times should I write that Interpol (ICPO) never send the investigator (here played by Ethan Hawke)? They may send to or receive the information from each country's police around the world, but never investigate themselves. Or how many times should we see the romance with a beautiful woman when we don't need it? Yuri gets his dream woman Ava (Bridget Moynahan) only to disappoint her. Yuri's brother gets what you know he will get when he reappears in the second half of the film, and so does Yuri's rival in business (Ian Holm). In spite of the good acting, these supporting roles only lessen the reality that the film is supposed to have.<br /><br />The film's weakness can be easily ignored if `Lord of War' is meant to be something entirely fictional. It is not, and the character of Yuri convinces you of the fact. But the film remains uneven, even has a scattershot appearance though the central character hits the target.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""The Lovely Bones" is great!"></head><body><p>"The Lovely Bones" is great! This is how the story goes: Susie Salmon, a young girl who has been murdered, watches over her family -- and her killer -- from heaven. She must weigh her desire for vengeance against her desire for her family to heal.<br /><br />The cast led by Mark Wahlberg (as Jack Salmon), Rachel Weisz (as Abigail Salmon), Susan Sarandon (as Grandma Lynn), Stanley Tucci (as George Harvey) & Saoirse Ronan (in a impressive performance as Susie Salmon) is excellent! The directing by Peter Jackson (who also wrote the screenplay & produced) (who also directed "Heavenly Creatures" (1994, also wrote the screenplay & co-produced), "The Frighteners" (1996, also wrote the story & screenplay & produced), "The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy (2001, 2002, & 2003, also wrote the screenplays and produced) & "King Kong" (2005, also wrote the screenplay and produced), he also produced "District 9" (2009) is excellent! The screenplay (based on Alice Sebold's novel) by Jackson, Fran Walsh (also produced) (she was an associate producer & also wrote the screenplay to "The Frighteners", she also wrote the screenplay to "Heavenly Creatures", she also produced "King Kong" & "The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy & Philippa Boyens (also co-produced) (both also wrote the screenplay to "King Kong" & "The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy), (she also co-produced "King Kong" & "District 9") is excellent!<br /><br />The music by Brian Eno (who also did the music to "The Jacket" (2005) is excellent! The cinematography by Andrew Lesnie (who also did the cinematography to "The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy, "King Kong", "I Am Legend" (2007) & the upcoming "The Last Airbender" (2010) is excellent! The film editing by Jabez Olssen (who also did additional editing to "King Kong" & "The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring" (2001) & "The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers" (2002) is excellent! The casting by Scot Boland, Victoria Burrows (both also did the casting to "A Christmas Carol" (2009), Jina Jay (who also did the casting to "The Reader" (2008) & "Atonement" (2007, which also starred Ronan), Avy Kaufman (who also did the casting to "Brothers" (2009) & the upcoming "Welcome To The Rileys" (2010) & Liz Mullane (who also did the casting to "King Kong" & "The Chronicles Of Narnia: Prince Caspian" (2008) is excellent! The production design by Naomi Shohan (who also did the production design to "I Am Legend" & the upcoming "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" (2010) is excellent! The art direction by Jules Cook (who also did the art direction to "The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe" (2005), senior art director on "The Chronicles Of Narnia: Prince Caspian") & Chris Shriver (who also did the art direction to "Inside Man" (2006) & "The Village" (2004) is excellent! The set decoration by George DeTitta Jr. (who also did the set decoration to "Inside Man", "I Am Legend" & the upcoming "The Sorcerer's Apprentice") & Meg Everist (who also did the set decoration to "We Are Marshall" (2006) is excellent! The costume design by Nancy Steiner (who also did the costume design to "Funny People" (2009) is excellent!<br /><br />This is an great, heartwrenching and effective drama that keeps you thinking and gets under your skin at its very core. This is a very different film for Peter Jackson. It has effective performances all around.</p></body></html>

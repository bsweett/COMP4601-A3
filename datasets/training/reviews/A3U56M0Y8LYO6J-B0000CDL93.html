Immediate controversy was stirred up by its questionable accuracy and its seemingly outrageous claims.  However, one must remember that this is a feature film from a Hollywood studio and not a documentary objectively examining its subject.  "Historical" films are notorious for "fudging" the truth in order to maximize its dramatic impact and "JFK" is no different.  The film does stack the deck by leading its viewers to draw only one possible conclusion - that the official inquiry into JFK's assassination was part of a conspiracy - but should the film be penalized for its one-sidedness?  The answer is no.  "JFK" is meant to be art and makes no claims to be 100% accurate or objective.  It is a fictional interpretation of a traumatic historical event with elements of the real-life event included in its narrative.  It is a story about the possible circumstances surrounding JFK's assassination and not a story of what actually happened.  On that level, the film is a masterpiece.  <p>"JFK" stars Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison, a man obsessed with getting to the bottom of the Kennedy assassination.  Through his investigation, he becomes convinced that Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) did not act alone in killing Kennedy? The physical evidence cited in the Warren Commission report just does not support the claim of a lone gunman.  Something is amiss but what exactly?  Does businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) have the key to unlocking the entire investigation?  So many questions but unfortunately so little answers.  In the end, the holes in the story are never filled and the mystery of what really happened in Dallas on November 22, 1963 survives to haunt the nation for another day.  <p>Stone never does try to solve the "JFK" mystery once and for all.  He merely puts forth his own personal interpretation of events and the technique he employs in dispensing his evidence is a technical triumph of editing.  Documentary and newly-shot footage are weaved together with flashback sequences to create a mesmerizing chronicle of what Stone thinks happened.  Costner is dazzling in his portrayal of Garrison.  Those filmgoers jaded by Costner's lack of recent quality performance should revisit "JFK" to remind themselves of just how much talent Costner does possess.  The supporting cast is made up of an honor roll of screen legends past and present.  In addition to the aforementioned Oldman and Jones are Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, Sissy Spacek, Jack Lemmon, Ed Asner, and Walter Matthau.  Under Stone's guidance, the contributions of all these performers along with those of editors Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia have gelled together to produce one of the finest films of the 1990's.  It must be remembered that "JFK" is a work of fiction and not fact and on that level it is a truly inspirational work from a talented filmmaker.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing"></head><body><p>Meryl Streep is pretty good.  Pierce Brosnan is awful - he can't sing and shouldn't try.  There is a kind of peculiar slant to this movie - all the strong roles go to women - the men are weak and have marginal roles.  Most of the emotional and physical intimacy is between women with men shut out.  If this is your cup of tea, you might like this movie.</p></body></html>

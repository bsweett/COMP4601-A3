<meta name="summary" content="Jaws"></head><body><p>Still under age 30 when released, wunderkind director Spielberg hit the big time with this runaway box-office hit, based on Peter Benchley's novel. John Williams's unforgettable score and Spielberg's clever mounting of suspense recall the best of Hitchcock, and Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw make up an unlikely but appealing trio of protagonists. What "Psycho" did for the shower, "Jaws" does for the ocean. Be sure to get the new 30th Anniversary edition- the movie looks flawless.</p></body></html>

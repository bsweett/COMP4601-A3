It's even harder to believe that Tim Curry, Willem Dafoe, David Bowie and James Woods were considered for the Joker. Thankfully, the powers that be gave us Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson in their respective roles that made this film a classic among Batman fans. Directed by Tim Burton, Batman was a critical and financial success. The film inspired Batman: The Animated Series and a series of films. Up until the release of "The Dark Knight", it was the highest grossing film based on a DC comic book. In my opinion, this movie is the definitive Batman movie. With over 50 years of comic books to be based upon, it's the one closest to Bob Kane's original vision for Batman. Although there were three more movies to follow after this one, This movie is my most favorite out of them all. I mean, it had an all-star cast involved with it like Kim Basinger, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle, Billy Dee Williams, Jack Palance, and Jerry Hall. Heck, even Batman creator Bob Kane has a cameo in the movie. Who wouldn't like it?? This Two-Disc Special Edition includes features such as Audio Commentary by director Tim Burton, Legends of the Dark Knight Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight Parts 1-3 Beyond Batman Documentary Galleries, On the Set with Bob Kane featurette, and three music videos by Prince. Definitely worth getting if you're a Batman fan.</p></body></html>

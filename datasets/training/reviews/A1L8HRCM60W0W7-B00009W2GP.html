I am pretty sure all the mind-numbing action will not have half the effect when played off a DVD. For another, no point reading too many of the partisan reviews, The Matrix franchise never had the unanimous universal appeal badge after its first film. <p>But since this is a review, I need to offer my personal take. <p>The first Matrix, a fab concept executed with unprecedented  pizzazz, was a colossal hit because of its novel concept -- it let your mind ponder the extent of the concept. "Reloaded" dug into the story and complicated things further, which was a mixed bag as far as I am concerned, but still left me anticipating an ending I was sure would blow me away.<p>Having seen this third installment, I just feel gyped. I guess anyone who anxiously awaited this release will know exactly what I mean. It's almost like the Wachowskis sat down to review the first two movies and said, "Hey, too much character development and story. Now let's get down to the nitty gritty, and start shooting". There's more bazooka-toting characters here than you'd find in a crude Japanese anime, and the whole ambience is very hasty as if time was running out to rake in the dollars from the movie making. <p>So, personally, I am a bit disappointed and seek consolation in the knowledge that when the DVDs do become available as a Criterion trilogy or something, the first movie alone will carry the entire Matrix family.<p>Nevertheless, if you manage your expectations, this third part makes for some fast-action weekend popcorn if that's your thing.</p></body></html>

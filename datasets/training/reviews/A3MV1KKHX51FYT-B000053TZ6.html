<meta name="summary" content="A Biography of a Newspaper Tycoon"></head><body><p>The film opens on a silent and dark night. An old man dies peacefully in bed, alone. It shows the vast riches of this extremely wealthy man - his monument. Charles Foster Kane was the greatest newspaper tycoon of his day. His wealth derived from a gold mine in Colorado, obtained almost by chance. His newspapers were loved by many, and hated by many. The news reels give his history. He was on track to be elected governor, but a sex scandal caused a loss. He retired to Xanadu, his lavish estate, then died as all must. The journalists will try to investigate his life to figure out his dying words (as if that could be relevant to anybody). This film continues as a search to uncover a mystery that may be unexplainable.<br /><br />Charles Foster Kane was taken from his parents at an early age because of a contract his mother signed (her investment advisor). Kane received the best education money can buy, but this is omitted. Kane's pleasure is his newspaper, he is a crusader for the masses against the Robber Barons (to deprive a third party of this cause). But in time he is forced to sell control of his 'Inquirer' to a bank. The scenes show how editorial policy is remade. [Note the gas lights, an open flame.] Kane hires away the newspaper men from a competitor to create the greatest circulation in New York, the financial capital. Kane marries the niece of a President (money talks?). Jed Leland tells his memories of Kane. The scenes show Charles' changes in his marriage (he is more arrogant and powerful). Kane runs for governor, a liberal who is the friend of the working man and decent people. [But will the ruling class support this upstart?]<br /><br />Poor Charlie doesn't realize that private investigators were shadowing him, and his private life ends his hope for a public life. [Most big city politicians were taking payoffs to support the local corporations.] Nothing is more scandalous than a reformer with hidden faults; a politician who is known to love drink and women won't be defeated for this. Susan's singing career soon ends. Perhaps they aimed too high, musical comedies rather than grand opera? Some very dramatic scenes follow and reveal more of the personalities of Charles and Susan. Poor Susan can't stand the strain and pressure. Can a publisher really create a star? Can a millionaire provide a starring role for his girlfriend today? Does great wealth and power lead to corruption and insanity? Was Kane's search for love the result of an unhappy childhood? Charlie's vandalism of his wife's bedroom suggests a sick mind. There is an inventory of Kane's property. What is it worth? Kane saved everything (like many of his generation). At the end we see a child's sled and its name.<br /><br />This film may have been novel in its day, but now seems dated. It seems like it came from a radio play. It is not really historical or satirical. There were plenty of other targets available, but this film barely recognizes the events that existed during Kane's lifetime (post Civil War to World War II). A fictionalized account closer to reality might have been better.<br /><br />Since he died alone, how did anyone learn his last word?</p></body></html>

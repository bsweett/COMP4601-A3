<meta name="summary" content="what a tangled web we weave"></head><body><p>Following on from the good things already said by others:<br /><br />It's one of those flicks where nothing is as it seems, and I'm definitely going to give it a second viewing, because in the end I realized how everything was just so nicely wrapped up and the tangled web untangled itself in that second most pure of motivating emotions: REVENGE (the first one being 'Love' of course). You think 'The Bride' in Kill Bill is p-oed? Kiddo, you ain't seen nothing yet. Just about everybody in LNS dies by bullets, projected from silenced semi-automatics--not swords--but it works just as well. Lots of brains and gore spattering across the place, plus a neat twist at the end in a tale of a gazillion tangles and twists and quick non-linear time warps to explain what the hell was actually going on. And things just ain't what they seem. Nothing ever is.<br /><br />Revenge in LNS was not a dish eaten completely cold. In the final act, when the worst offender of them all gets his brains spattered across the inside of his car, the purity of the emotion and its raw darkness--and at the same time it's utter inevitability and sheer rightness--is beautifully portrayed by an actor, for whom I have acquired a new respect; for he evidences both, a subtle comic timing that needs to be seen to be believed, as well as a capacity to look like an almost-evil implacable dispenser of justice that had been far too long in coming. Very nicely done. Highly recommended for those of my disposition--though those of more tender sensibilities might find the blood and gore somewhat off-putting.</p></body></html>

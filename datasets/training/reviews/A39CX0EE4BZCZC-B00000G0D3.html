<meta name="summary" content="This Is The Best This Epic Film Has Ever Looked And Sounded"></head><body><p>Wow, what can you say about a film that won 11 Academy Awards back in the days where the best films actually were honored, not the garbage they salute today?<br /><br />In other words, this film lives up to its reputation and has to be ranked as one of the most memorable movies of all time. Nobody who ever saw this film ever forgot the chariot race, for instance, perhaps the greatest action scene filmed without special effects.<br /><br />This can be a very sad film as well. I doubt if I've ever watched this without a few tears in my eyes at certain points. The scenes with hero's mother and sister suffering with leprosy are still some of the most heart-wrenching scenes I've ever witnessed on film. They can just tear you apart.<br /><br />The combination of drama, action and romance, along with very involving storyline is aided by an incredible soundtrack, once again one of the best ever put on film. The more one hears this music, the more was is moved by it.<br /><br />To fully appreciate  all of the above, including the wonderful cinematography in this film, I recommend you purchase this 4-disc DVD special edition which also includes the first rendition of this story, the silent movie "Ben-Hur: A Tale Of The Christ." That was name of the book, by the way, the second part of the title being left off the 1959 movie as Hollywood slowly began deemphasizing Christianity in films.  The restoration job here on that' 59 film, by the way, is fantastic. Ben-Hur has never looked better.<br /><br />Both versions are outstanding. In summary, this is about as good an example as ever found of what is labeled an "epic" movie. It's an incredible story transferred memorably on screen.....and it's never looked nor sounded better than on this DVD version.</p></body></html>

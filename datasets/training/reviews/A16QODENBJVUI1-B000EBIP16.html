<meta name="summary" content="A nice rendering of C. S. Lewis's magical world"></head><body><p>My fear when I first heard that a series of films based on C. S. Lewis's marvelous CHRONICLES OF NARNIA books I was simultaneously fearful and hopeful.  I was afraid, on the one hand, that they would somehow mangle the books in translating them to the screen; I was hopeful, on the other hand, that perhaps the filmmakers would do for Lewis what Peter Jackson had done for Lewis's friend J. R. R. Tolkein and his LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy.  Neither my hopes nor my fears were realized, for while this is in no way a bad movie, it doesn't come up to the level of the LOTR.<br /><br />This is quite a good film, and that in itself is something of an achievement.  In rereading a couple of Lewis's Narnia books lately, I've increasingly wondered if it is possible to do a great--as opposed to merely a very good--translation of these books into film.  The problem is twofold.  First, the books are quite literary in a way that Tolkein's books are not.  So much of the substance of the book consists of the manner in which Lewis addresses the reader and the filmmakers either did not try or did not succeed in finding an analog to this in the film.  On the other hand, this same manner of addressing the reader actually pads out the book, creating far more pages than a more succinct treatment of the subject would have done.  This is not a fault of the novel; far from it.  But it does leave the filmmaker with a problem with a lack of action.  Thus, anyone making a film is forced to think of ways to pad out the action.  This is the opposite problem with most adaptations of a literary source.  Usually you have too little time to squeeze in too much content.  Here there is too much time to contain the content that the novel provides.  Hence, the result is a heavily embellishment of the book.  One finds more in the movie than one finds in the book, and I'm not entirely certain that this is a good thing.  The upside is that not much that was added was bad.<br /><br />If the film just missed that last extra bit of magic that would have made it a masterpiece, it did manage to be at least excellent in almost every area.  They made a great decision at the outset, opting to following the "real" order of the books, instead of the wretched reordering brought about by Lewis's stepson and literary executor Douglas Gresham (who gets co-producer credit in the film, almost certainly an honorary designation, since his insistence on reordering the books shows he really doesn't understand them).  Think of how awful it would have been if the film series had started with the weakest novel in the series, THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW, instead of THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, which is the finest (though perhaps not the one most suited to translation to film--more of this below).  The music was excellent, the sets were superb, the CGI consistently excellent, the art direction marvelous.  Though the cast featured virtually no name performers, I found no problems in the casting.  I very much liked the kids in the film, especially Georgie Henley as Lucy, which is probably the most important of the four children's roles to get right.  Tilda Swinton, one of the great film actresses of the past decade, was excellent as the witch; though I thought her costuming was a bit below par.  The fake shoulders they gave her at times looked quite absurd.  Liam Neeson was a good choice to voice Aslan, though I admit that I regret Brian Cox's having dropped out of the project.  I am not aware what issues were in play in causing him to leave, but I think his extremely gruff voice would have been wonderfully appropriate for Aslan, who is not, of course, a tame lion.  The CGI for Aslan was very good and I wasn't the tiniest bit disappointed with Aslan's appearance.  Since he is the only character who will appear in every film, it was essential to get him right.  Aslan is not, as many suppose, a Christ figure.  Instead, Lewis meant him actually to be Christ as he might have been incarnated as a mighty lion in a magical land called Narnia.  To the filmmakers' credit, they did not mute the religious message at the heart of the books, but neither did they highlight it more than Lewis himself did.  I think they struck the right balance.<br /><br />There is a very real chance that some of the other books in the series will be more successful as films than this one.  THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER, for instance, has considerable possibility as a movie, including what is quite probably the finest single character in the series apart from Aslan.  I speak, of course, of the swashbuckling mouse Reepicheep.  Even THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW, which is a fairly weak book, has considerable potential as a film.  And if they get THE LAST BATTLE, Lewis's non-premillenial rendering of the end of the world, right, it could end up one of the great film fantasies ever created.  I no longer fear that they will do a disservice to Lewis's books in these films, but I will continue to hope that they create something magical.</p></body></html>

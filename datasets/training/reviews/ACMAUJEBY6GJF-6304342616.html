<meta name="summary" content="I mostly enjoy Sci-fi-movies, and though..."></head><body><p>...this is far from being a favorite of mine it still has its' moments. I've bought it, the sound and picture (still today) is very good indeed, and the effects -well, some still stunning, some not! Like one of the many explotions, the one in that tunnel with the dog managing to save its' own life in the nick of time, that was not so good.<br /><br />Actually the biggest problem is the man supposed to be the star of "Independence day". Yes, Will Smith! I wonder if he maybe thinks he is a "bit" cooler than the rest of the planet thinks. He has fans of course, but I remember being embarrased by him overacting already in the "Fresh Prince"-series. He is painful to watch in "I.d". I know of course he didn't write the script nor his own lines, but Will Smith becomes a parody on himself in the movie. And I don't know how many times during the movie I wanted to tell him to "Shut up!". I mean hitting the alien on its' way out of the spaceship; "Welcome to earth! Now that's what I'd call a close encounter!" There are plenty of those.<br /><br />Other than that, and the "America save us all!"-patriotism, well as mentioned -"Independence day" has its' moments and highlights, and some remembarable scenes. What I'm trying to say is that some of the story here also functions, it's not all effects.<br /><br />They say that the biggest Sci-fi-movie ever is the classic "War of the Worlds", not that I agree on that, but that movie probably was what "Independence day" was when it was released in the theatres back in the mid-90's. Because despite the critics, "I.d" was a big hit when it came -so all in all, a sci-fi-fan might enjoy this even though I find no excuse for Will Smiths' overcool-part!</p></body></html>

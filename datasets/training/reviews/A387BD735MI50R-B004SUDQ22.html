<meta name="summary" content="Doesn't Quite Add Up"></head><body><p>As the movie starts, I was struck by its stagey quality. First Paltrow declaims; then Hopkins declaims. In the DVD commentary, I learned that this movie was in fact adapted from a stage play in which Paltrow also starred. I had somehow missed knowing about the existence of that originating stage play, but was glad to be proven right in my instincts about how these movie characters were projecting. The acting gets a little more fluid and natural as the movie progresses, but never completely loses its staged quality.<br /><br />Other aspects of this movie are artsy and artificial. For example, Hopkins' schizophrenia doesn't look like the schizophrenia of anyone I've known diagnosed with the condition. Hopkins' schizophrenia is played strictly to the balcony.<br /><br />Paltrow's character, while meant to be sympathetic, actually comes off as being adamant at the wrong moments, over-the-top shrill at the wrong moments, then pliant and self-doubting at the wrong moments. I began to lose interest in her when she brimmed with such loud indigation over the police coming to her door and wanting to question her - after she had CALLED them reporting a burglary in progress!<br /><br />Again in the DVD commentary, Director John Madden congratulates himself and everone involved in this project on creating such nuanced characters. He cites Paltrow's sister as an example of the triumph of nuance over stereotype. However, I found Paltrow's sister to be a completely stereotypical villainess. She has no redeeming virtues. She is a social wasp. The commentary is apt when Madden says her actions remind him of key Shakespearean scenes. She is like the MacBeth play-within-a-play wherein the murderers pour poison into the King's ear. She is Iago, whispering tragic lies into Othello's ear. She goes crisply on her way, scratching people, along with errands, off her "to-do" list. And she doesn't change or grow as the action progresses. She will continue ticking down her list to the end.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal is the only truly likeable, sympathetic character in this movie. He is the kind of friend everyone might wish to have. His developing bond with Paltrow is what holds this movie together and makes it worthwhile.<br /><br />As for the math - I wish there were MORE of it. The audience never really gets a feel for the importance of any math study here. All we get is the too-often repeated pronouncement that it's all over for a math thinker by the age of 22. But what about the math itself? We really don't get an inkling of what Paltrow has proven or failed to prove. And making the rudaments of a math idea available to a popular audience is possible, as shown by the TV series "Numbers." I was hoping there would be more Numbers in here, and less histrionics. There may be form in this movie, but there just isn't enough function.</p></body></html>

The only redeeming qualities "Resident Evil-Apocalypse" has going for it are CGI effects and stunts.  Nonexistent plot, lousy dialogue (lots of cursing), women running around half or completely naked (while all the men are fully clothed).  Even the zombies were far better done in the recent remake of "Dawn of the Dead".  Milla Jovovich has yet to make an impression on me in any film she has been in.<br /><br />Movies like this one seem to assume that videogame devotees aren't intelligent enough to deal with such things as decent story, good acting, etc.  Judging by some reviews on this site, maybe the producers of 'Apocalypse' are right.  1 star, and that's stretching it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="'Kung Fu Panda' Kicks!"></head><body><p>I enter this movie with one question: Was Jack Black born to play the voice of Po, or was he merely groomed to play it? I wouldn't be surprised if the whole movie were centered with him in mind. `Kung Fu Panda' is another Dreamworks' production, one that employs or improves admirable animation tricks--giving the film the vitality of a free-flowing digital puppet show. A visual delight, the film has the innovation of `<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UFIYP8">Surf's Up (Full Screen Special Edition)</a>' combined with the entertainment value of `Ratatouille'. Sent mostly on the fast track, the film has a good ol' witty time matched with artful adventure.<br /><br />Literally and figuratively, Po (Black) dreams of becoming a Kung Fu master. He's a chubby Panda bear who has more passion for eating than making the food at his family's noodle restaurant. As he's humoring his stork father, a crisis develops in the village: A prophecy states Tai Lung (Ian McShane), a dragon more aptly described as a snow leopard with pouncing Kung Fu proficiency will escape Chorgum Prison. The town converges on Jade Square, the center of The Valley of Peace where holy wise tortoise, Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim), will announce the chosen Dragon Warrior. Clumsily, Po propels himself in the center where Oogway, pointing at Tigress has his finger on the panda instead.<br /><br />All the voices are right on. Jack Black as already mentioned makes all the "That's cool," aphorisms work through his own hapless character. Happily his lines lack the hyperactivity of Po's training or Black's own character past. ("I know you're being all mystical and Kung Fu-ooey," he chortles.) Hardly discernible is Dustin Hoffman, perfectly cast as the quiet curmudgeon master trainer, Shifu (Chief-u). Some of the funniest scenes go along with Po's training. "There is now a level zero!" he proclaims after Po's first session. There's also an acupuncture scene that makes a point of Po's ridiculous novice status. Flanking him are the furious five, including a viper (Lucy Liu), a preying mantis (Seth Rogen), a monkey (Jackie Chan), a crane (David Cross) and a tigress (Angelina Jolie), each bringing a certain perfection to their parts. They're all Shifu's prodigies, and each sport some superhero Kung Fu moves as well as resentful remarks for their new dragon slayer trainee.<br /><br />Adding fortune cookie wisdom to the mix both illuminates and entertains. ("One takes one's destiny on the road to avoid it." and "There's no such thing as an accident." Now I may be all wrong, but I thought Freud said that one.) Everyone from director Jack Stevenson to editor Clare Knight deserve kudos for assembling such a fine feature. Containing a well done script, shaking up the animation formula, and mixing funny with fabulous action scenes, 'Kung Fu Panda' may duke it out with '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FSL3E">Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)</a>' in the animation category when it comes to Oscar time.</p></body></html>

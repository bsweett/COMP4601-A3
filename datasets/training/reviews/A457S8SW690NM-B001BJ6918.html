<meta name="summary" content="Not like #1 (3 and 1/2 stars)"></head><body><p>Well, after seeing the absolutely brilliant and just plain awesome Kill Bill Vol. 1, I had my hopes very high for this one. I couldn't wait for it. But, when I left the theater, I was actually dissapointed. This one isn't at all like its predecessor. While the first one had MANY absolutely awesome fighting scenes and had great humor and a great story, this didn't like that one. First off, this one was way too long, and it went too much into detail in the past and training of the Bride. That's where it kind of lost me. Sure, the scene where she fights the Nurse is great, but that's really all. I have to admit, I liked some of the story andd it was a solid movie but was just way too slow moving. Where's the awesome fight scenes? Where's the great humor? I really don't know. and then the fight against Bill just didn't deliver. It was a really average and just weird fight that wasn't like what I had expected. this was a letdown. But, it still deserves 3 and 1/2 stars for one awesome fighting, some very neat moments, and some interesting parts. Also, watch the only deleted scene. It's a really good fight where Bill kcks a**! If you liked the first one, you should rent this but probably not buy it unless you're just a plain die hard fan. This movie is above average but dissapointing and unlike the wiked # 1.</p></body></html>

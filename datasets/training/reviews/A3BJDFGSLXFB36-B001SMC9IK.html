<meta name="summary" content="Was Al Gore involved in this film?"></head><body><p>I have been a fan of the original version ever since I was a small boy and even then, I understood the message of the film. Man has to get past his petty differences with his own species or we are in big trouble.<br /><br />Back in the 50s, this was a timely allegory and I believe that audiences were willing to accept such a message disguised as a sci-fi film.<br /><br />Well, a lot has changed since then. Where do I start?<br /><br />Well, the special effects, just like the original, are quite well-done. The lead actor, Keanu Reeves, can't act his way out of a paper bag, whereas, Michael Rennie of the original was quite a respected talent and was an excellent leading man.<br /><br />Well, in these times, we are all being force-fed this "man is destroying the earth" stuff everytime we turn around. I will keep my personal opinions about that out of this review, but when I go see a movie, I don't want to be preached to. I want to be entertained. And, as it's been happening all too often in Hollywood films, the movie just abruptly ends and you're actually wanting a serious resolution.<br /><br />Well, you won't find it here.<br /><br />I do appreciate how the film makers tried to update this classic film, but they went too far and just had to throw in some politically correct world views to make the film "acceptable".<br /><br />Stuff and nonsense.<br /><br />Skip this and rent (or buy) the original version. You'll be better off.<br /><br />(Thanks a lot, Mr. Gore!)</p></body></html>

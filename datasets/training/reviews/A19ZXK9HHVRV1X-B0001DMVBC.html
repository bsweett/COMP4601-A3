<meta name="summary" content="a genuine work of art"></head><body><p>"The House of Sand and Fog," easily one of the best movies of 2003, is a haunting and hypnotic tale about how even good, well-intentioned people - through lack of empathy and apparently harmless self interest - can end up hurting others and even themselves without meaning to do so.  It is also about how the most seemingly insignificant events in life can lead to unimaginable tragedies.<p>Based on the novel by Andre Dubus III, "The House of Sand and Fog" stars Jennifer Connelly as Kathy, a young woman battling depression after her husband ran out on her eight months earlier.  One morning, already in the depths of despair, Kathy is informed that she is being evicted from her house for nonpayment of a business tax that she rightfully claims she doesn't owe.  Before the county can rectify the error, it has already placed the house up for auction.  Ben Kingsley plays Behrani, the man who buys the home unaware of its embattled history.  Behrani was a colonel in pre-Khomeini Iran, forced to flee that country with his wife and children when the Shah fell from power.  Now an American citizen, Behrani labors at two low paying jobs to keep his family living as much as possible in the style to which they were accustomed back home.  When Karen's repossessed home goes on the market at a bargain basement rate, Behrani purchases it, hoping to move his family there temporarily, then sell it at market value and move to an even better place.  Thus begins the bizarre conflict between two well meaning but stubborn people, both of whom have a stake in the situation, both of whom are equally victims of the system, and both of whom are determined to come out the winner in this contest of wills. <p>Besides having the most interesting storyline of any movie of recent times, "The House of Sand and Fog" also boasts some of the most interesting characters as well.  Kathy is a beautiful woman who wants desperately to lead a healthy, normal life - she has been working to overcome her addiction to both cigarettes and alcohol - but the fates have simply not been very kind to her of late.  When she realizes that she has become the victim of a bureaucratic bungling, she knows that she must make a stand and fight, fully aware that the people with whom she is contending are as blameless as she is.  In a similar way, Behrani means no harm to anyone, yet he realizes that he too is not to blame for what has happened and resents being made to feel guilty because he is legally trying to make money to ensure a better life for his wife and son.  He also knows that, as an immigrant of Middle Eastern descent, he faces a higher hurdle to mount than white people who were born in this country.  The screenplay does a fine job underlining this subtle attitude of racism, particularly in the third main character, Lester, a sheriff's deputy who comes to care for Karen and who is willing to bend the law some and risk his own career to help her out.  Lester, like the other characters, is also willing to hurt others to ensure his own happiness, even abandoning his wife and two young children to start life anew with Karen.<p>In addition to Connelly and Kingsley, there are superb performances by Ron Eldard as Lester, Jonathan Ahdout as Behrani's teenaged son, and Shohren Aghdashloo as Behrani's wife who is caught between her own strong-willed nature and the traditional role of subservient wife she knows she must play.  Aghdashloo provides some of the movie's most emotionally complex moments and scenes, as she struggles to understand both the events that are taking place around her and what those events say about the character of the man who is her husband.<p>Moreover, "The House of Sand and Fog" is a beautifully written and directed film.  Writer/director Vadim Perelman establishes a lyrical, hypnotic tone through a camera that seems to be forever gliding through and around the scene of action.  The film is so confidently paced and structured that the two main combatants in the story - Karen and Behrani - do not even meet until almost an entire hour of the film has elapsed.  Perelman spends the first sections of the film sketching in the details of the main characters' lives, in order for us to better understand where they are coming from and what it is they want.  It would be so easy in a story like this one to pigeonhole one character as a hero and another as a villain, but the point of the story is that these are just ordinary people who don't want to hurt others but who end up doing so just the same. <p>If the movie becomes a bit more melodramatic in the closing stretches than perhaps is warranted - striving for Shakespearean-type tragedy when a simpler resolution might have sufficed - at least it's TRYING to accomplish something meaningful, which is more than can be said for the vast majority of films these days.  "The House of Sand and Fog" may not be a perfect film, but it comes damn near close.  At the very least, it is a totally mesmerizing experience that is impossible to forget.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="good gory remake of the classic movie"></head><body><p>I still like the original 1940's 'the wolfman' more than this one , it's a true classic and has lon chaney and bela lugosi, and claude rains in it. This one however is a good version,  All the acting in this one is done very well to be sure , I could havd done without the father/son struggle but it gave us a battle of the wolfmen for a climax so it did have some validity. This blu ray looks stunning though, just beautiful and that's because it's a modern film shot on high quality film. THe cgi effects look overall top grade too, one thing that's classic about this one is the way the wolfman looks ,much like the traditional version and it works very well in this movie. The wolfman is a frightening half man , half wolf creature that can run like a wolf. Something the original couldn't do but that doesn't make the original less a true classic movie though. The blu ray has the unrated version and the theatrical version , plus deleted scenes and documentary stuff which are in hd as well. I could do without the digital copy though if it will bring prices down lets get rid of digital copies for good. I don't buy this to watch on tiny computer screens or laptops.  Some people were turned off by the gore but lets be fair here this is a movie about a werewolf that tears people apart and eats them. The cgi effects have progressed alot since the last well bigger budget werewolf movie 'cursed' for sure , it's amazing how far effects have come in 6 years or less. Still only twits complain about effects of older movies they were fine for their day usually and still bring me enjoyment even from the 1930's era. The story is much the same about a man bitten by a werewolf who becomes one and fears and hates what he has become so that is a plus for this one. I would say that if you don't like gory movies then  you won't like this one , but it didn't bother me because I am a horror fan. And the people who made this movie were fans of the original wolfman series and probably the great paul naschys very gothic wolfman series; 'mark of the wolfman' and such which are worth grabbing too. 'night of the werewolf and vengence of the zombies' are on one blu ray , it's old school werewolf fun though don't expect cgi effects. But I love old horror movies. I have tried to grab most of naschys werewolf movies on dvd too. This is bloodier than those but naschys has alot of good vibe to it too.<br />I would say horror fans will like this movie and others may not, but at least it has excellent acting from the lead actors involved Benico Del toro is truly excellent in this movie. His torment is really conveyed to the viewer throughout this movie. So grab this one and check out naschys film too if you are gothic werewolf fan.</p></body></html>

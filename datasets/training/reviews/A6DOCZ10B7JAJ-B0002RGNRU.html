No, it's a psychological romance.  I'm not sure how to label Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, except that it is a great, great film.<br /><br />The viewer is entrapped in the construction, or rather the deconstruction, of love.  Joel(Carrey) has a surgical procedure done to erase the memory of his ex-girlfriend, Clementine(Winslet).  He does this after learning she also had the mind erasure performed.<br /><br />It is a vivid journey through Joel's memories, and during the operation he realizes how much he still loves her.  But he's already paid to forget her.<br /><br />Can true love find a way to survive?  You'll have to watch and see.</p></body></html>

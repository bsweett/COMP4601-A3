The first 15 min was so bad it's almost as bad as to walk out of the theaters they draged it on and on and on (you'll be screaming at the screen to get on the rollercoster allready). The film gets good when the death scenes' start happening the death parts are really good and well done just like the other films. The acting was bad and I mean bad. The first film is still the best and the sequal was better but this film was still good and a must see if you seen the other films and the film is entertaining.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Best Superhero Movie of all Time"></head><body><p>For more than 60 years he has been the most popular superhero of all time and now he's returned to movie screens in Bryan Singer's action packed and emotionally terrific triumph "Superman Returns" no question the best Superman movie yet, Brandon Routh is a recarnation of Christopher Reeve, Kevin Spacey outdoes Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor and Kate Bosworth gives a terrific new approach to Lois Lane. Spetacular and fantastic, a triumph, one of the best summer movies no doubt, a brilliantly riveting motion picture event that pays homage to the Richard Donner films, Terrific Entertainment, this is a must see event, go look up at the movie screen "SUPERMAN RETURNS" and I hope he returns again.

<meta name="summary" content="A Few Twist And Turns."></head><body><p>I knew what to expect when I rented this movie.  The synopsis on the back of the box spelled out most of the story, even the parts one had to read-into.  But what I found pleasant about this film is the unexpected turns and twist, such as Tom Cruise's character's first HIT falling four stories onto the cab he was using.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx plays cabbie Max, a man with big dreams and a lot of common sense.  He finds himself in quite a bind after Tom Cruise's character, hitman Vincent, forces him to drive him to all of his scheduled assassinations.<br /><br />Yes, some of this movie is predictable, but a there are also a few twist and turns that make the movie more enjoyable.  The actual activities and routes the charaters perform are believable, parts of the dialogue are NOT.  When Jamie Foxx calls to warn a woman that Vincent is on the way to kill her, the woman keeps saying, "I don't understand.  What are you saying." That was totally unbelievable.  I think there should have been a little more thought put into the dialogue of this film.  Too much hype and spice was thrown into the mix.  The action was good enough that Mann could have relied on more believable dialogue to keep the film flow seem more even.<br /><br />All and all, this is a good movie.  I think most people will enjoy the entertainmnet.  Warning to those with children (and us adults that are sick of hearing the F-word all the time), there is a lot of cussing in this movie...ummm...and...violence. :-)<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="See the sequel next year.."></head><body><p>This movie was made with a sequel in mind, just look at how it ended! But I did enjoy this film, I liked the atmosphere and the characters and the story is pretty interesting (hard to follow?? - no way.) Why such bad reviews? Who knows, maybe the critics are Lycans and the moon was full when they saw the movie.</p></body></html>

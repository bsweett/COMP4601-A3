<meta name="summary" content="Definitive Ford-Wayne Classic Still Mesmerizes Despite Its Somewhat Dated Blemishes"></head><body><p>There is so much that is impressive in director John Ford's masterful 1956 classic that it is easy to get preoccupied with its glaring flaws. However, it's most important to recognize this film as a cinematic elegy of the old-fashioned western, a last-stand monument to Ford's unique oeuvre in movies before the revisionist filmmakers reshaped this type of film to meet contemporary tastes. Yet for its patently old-fashioned premise, the film contains unexpected darker tones which make the film fascinating. First, it depicts the unapologetic racism prevalent out in the frontier, and second, it has Ethan Edwards, a protagonist who not only shares these feelings but somehow redeems himself through his fortitude and often violent acts of self-defense. Through a vivid use of darkened doorways as a framing device, Ford and star John Wayne dexterously manage to elicit sympathy for the unsympathetic Edwards while maintaining his dying-breed status as a renegade outsider.<br /><br />Set in Texas a few years after the Civil War, the story focuses on Edwards' five-year long search for what remains of his family after a massacre by a band of Comanches headed by a chief named Scar. It becomes clear that youngest daughter Debbie may be alive, so Edwards and young tag-along, Martin Pawley, set off to find her. The motivations of the two couldn't be more different - Edwards was in love with Debbie's now-dead mother and seeks vengeance, which includes killing Debbie for being a converted Comanche; while Pawley wants to save Debbie and bring her back home. Frank S. Nugent's screenplay masterfully peels the layers off their journey with a series of revelations that lead to the dramatic final act. This is likely Wayne's finest two hours on film not because he plays his archetypal cowboy hero but because he shows a surprising audacity in exposing the dark soul of his character while slowly recognizing a begrudging humanism through his discoveries in the film.<br /><br />Everybody else is merely serviceable in comparison, including Jeffrey Hunter, who darts unsteadily between youthful arrogance and childish petulance as Pawley; Ward Bond as a bellowing reverend and Texas ranger; and a teenaged Natalie Wood, who has scant screen time late in the film as the grown Debbie. Vera Miles fares somewhat better as the headstrong Laurie, the girl Pawley leaves behind, though I find their romantic subplot rather distracting, especially toward the end with a lighthearted but lengthy wedding sequence. In fact, comic relief is used a little too liberally throughout the film with irritating performances from Hank Worden as the mentally defective Mose Harper and Ken Curtis as Laurie's anxious suitor Charlie. However, these are minor blemishes in the scheme of things, especially in light of Winton C. Hoch's magnificent cinematography. Never has the camera captured the beauty and drama of Monument Valley with more emotional fervor, even if it is masquerading as Texas. Special mention should also be given to Max Steiner's powerful musical score.<br /><br />Above all else, the film reflects the pinnacle of both Ford's and Wayne's careers, a point not lost on the elaborate two-disc 2006 DVD set. The first disc has a pristine print of the film along with a brief introduction by Wayne's son Patrick (who plays a small role in the film as a baby-faced Union soldier) and a terrifically insightful commentary track by director Peter Bogdanovich. He is not the only master director who reveres the film, as Curtis Hanson, Martin Scorsese, and John Milius offer their own praise on a new half-hour documentary on the second disc, "The Searchers: A New Appreciation". There are two other excellent featurettes included -  a 1998 behind-the-scenes documentary, "A Turning of the Earth: John Ford, John Wayne and The Searchers," and a vintage piece hosted by Gig Young called "Behind the Cameras", which has interviews with Hunter and Wood and an overview of Monument Valley. Don't expect a politically correct film, but it is difficult not to be mesmerized by the work of such masters.</p></body></html>

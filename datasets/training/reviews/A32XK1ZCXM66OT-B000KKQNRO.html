<meta name="summary" content="Great movie, as long as you pay attention....."></head><body><p>This was a brilliant movie!!!! I mean, they had a great cast and Tom Hanks did a stand up job with his roll as Robert Langdon. The plot starts out very simple with a murder of one, of Langdon's friends at the Lourve in Paris. But when Langdon is notified about it. Then Langdon and a female cryptologist discover a very deep complex mystery behind the murder, that they must solve. Which will lead them to discover a secret link to the time of Christ. This is a great movie. But, you gotta make sure that you pay attention, while you are watching it. Or else, you will not understand it.</p></body></html>

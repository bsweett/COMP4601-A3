Little did they know at the time that they would grow up become adversaries, and as a result this would lead to may adventures. In the process Judah leads many different lives that parallels and crosses the life of Jesus.<br /><br />We see Judah in the mines, on the galleys, and even adopted by a roman Noble man as young Arrius.

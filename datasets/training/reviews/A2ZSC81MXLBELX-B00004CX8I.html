<meta name="summary" content="Definitive Jack! ...DVD Lacks"></head><body><p>This review refers to the December 1997 release of this DVD(WB)..<br />.<br />With the new Special Edition ...(released Sept 2002) and for sale here, I thought you might be trying to decide on which edition to get. So don't cringe at my 4 star rating of this movie, I give the movie itself 5 stars at least! My review will be of the earlier edition.<br /><br />First the movie... Jack Nicholson, in top form, plays Randall McMurphy, the newest arrival on the ward at a state mental institution. He has been transfered from prison to be "observed" to determine if he is really as "crazy" as he seems. He sees it as a kind of a vacation for the time he has left and at first is pretty happy to be there. He immediatley begins to breathe a little life into this otherwise "sedate" ward, much to the chagrin of the overseerer, the very evil Nurse Ratched(played brillantly by Louise Fletcher). She is the devil in a nurses uniform. She has had complete control and her finger on the button of every patiteint there until the arrival of "Mac".<br /><br />The other patitents (with excellant performances by Danny Devito,Christopher Llyod and Brad Dourif among others)normally obiediant and under her thumb start to come out of there shells and go along for the ride with "Mac". And what a ride, they have new experiences that make them feel like real men.(Look for Scatman Crothers on the night shift)<br /><br />Nurse Ratched knows which buttons to press to get them back under her control though, and she's REAL good at it. So it is a battle of wills between Mac and Ratched, and I won't give away the results in case you havn't seen it.<br /><br />The film under the direction of Milos Forman swept the 5 big ones at Oscar time(1975), and well deserved. It was also honored with many other international awards. We truly get a feeling for these men and the conditions they live under.<br /><br />Now the DVD. For the most part. it's pretty good. The picture is clear, no graininess, but the colors seem a little dated. The widescreen in good (There is a standard format on the other side for those who prefer), The sound is not the greatest. The background music is great but the dialouge seems to go in and out, sometimes muffled sometimes to loud. It is in Dolby Dig 2.0. If your interested in the Extras, there are some (filmographies, tribute to Scatman Crothers, facts about the making of the movie), there is no live commentary. There are subtitles in Eng French and Spanish.<br /><br />Although I have not seen the newly released special edition yet, I see that it has been digitally restored and is now in Dolby Dig 5.1. And for those that love the extras, looks like there are lots, including a documentary. If you are buying it for the first time, the new one is only a few dollars more, I say go for it if you can. I plan to upgrade mine, this film is unique and too good not to see it in the best possible format. In either case this is a must have film for your collection.<br /><br />See Jack Run.......Laurie</p></body></html>

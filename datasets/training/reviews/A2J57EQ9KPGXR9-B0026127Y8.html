<meta name="summary" content="Don't Try This At Home"></head><body><p>Taken is a very well paced thriller about an ex-CIA field agent who shoots his way through Paris looking for his kidnapped daughter. Liam Neeson does a good job playing the father, who kills a whole bunch of white slavers in the film (Interpol, please take note) while dodging bullets like Max Payne.<br /><br />Despite the torture scene, I enjoyed this film. I actually wanted to see it in the theatre but it wasn't there for very long. I don't regret buying Taken since the DVD will be viewed more than once.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A backwoods slasher film dragged down by bad directing"></head><body><p>Having watched "Jeepers Creepers" last week, a horror film with an awesome opening that disappointingly does not follow up on its promise, it was even more depressing to watch "Wrong Turn," a 2003 offering that has one of the least inspiring opening sequences ever.  A comely young couple are out in the woods of West Virginia doing some rock climbing when they are basically butchered off camera by unseen forces.  But any notion of mystery regarding who dunnit it is quickly dispelled by the film's credit sequences, which offers clippings and photographs about the problems of inbreeding and the legends of the backwoodsmen hiding out there in the forest.  By the end of the title credits the only question is how many of these crazy guys are out there in the woods and what specific genetic deformities do they have?  Do not worry, I will not spoil what limited amount of fun there is to have here by telling you the answers.<p>However, before those questions can be answered we have to meet the young folk fated to die horrible deaths.  Chris Finn (Desmond Harrington) is late for an appointment and ends up on a dirt road going through them thar backhills.  After an abrupt encounter with a stalled SUV he meets up with the rest of the menu offerings: the hot to trot Evan (Kevin Zegers) and Francine (Lindy Booth), the happy couple Scott (Jeremy Sisto) and Carly (Emmanuelle Chriqui), and the buffed but recently dumped Jessie (Eliza Dushku).  The group separates in an effort to find help and to make it easy for the first of them to die while the rest of the party finds the proverbial shack in the woods, which will get them up to speed on the danger they are facing.  Fortunately Chris is a medical student, so whether he is looking at road kill or opening up containers in a backwoods refrigerator, he can identify the sort of animal involved.  <p>Screenwriter Alan B. McElroy's idea of grossly disfigured mountain men hunting down young folks is a good enough idea for a slasher flick, although coming up with the cinematic in-breeding of "Wrong Turn" (cross basically any slasher film tha comes to mind with "Deliverance") is a bit diverting since you do not want to be repeatedly distracted during a film by remembering where you have seen similar things before (one episode of "The X-Files" kept coming to mind for me).  But director Rob Schmidt manages to make less out of the material on the screen than what appeared on the printed page.  The signature sequence in "Wrong Turn" is basically a single shot of an axe wedged into a tree (believe me, you will know it when you see it), but most of what should have been harrowing scenes of horror (e.g., the couple underneath the bed) just do not come off the way they should.  Usually when I watch a film I find myself focusing on how a script could have been improved, but this time around I spent most of the time taking the director to task.<p>For some reason I was hoping that the presence of Dushku and Sisto, who have enjoyed major supporting roles on two of the best televison series of the past decade in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Six Feet Under," was a sign that "Wrong Turn" was at least an above average slasher flick.  Maybe I am once again guilty of inflated expectations, but the results were very disappointing, because if this is just an average example of the genre that is an even more depressing conclusion.  The deleted scenes included on the DVD just provide additional nails in the coffin since watching your friends being butchered does not strike me as erotic and dailies of an actress being garotted with barbed wire is not exactly worthwhile.</p></body></html>

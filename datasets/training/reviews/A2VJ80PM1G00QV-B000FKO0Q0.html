<meta name="summary" content="Still Worth Seeing After More Than 15 years"></head><body><p>Nothing to add to the many reviews of this successful pictur, save that it is no flash-in-the-pan. It looks as good today as when it was first to be seen, as a first run movie, on television, and, then, on disc. The chase for an innocent man, seeking only to prove his innocence, is right up there with the best, although not the best among them. Ford is perfectly cast as the hero without "side", without the arrogance of a man of achievement, without the loss of humanity, to which nature predisposes any person in his situation. Repetition has taken some of the luster off the Award winning Tommy Lee Jones performance; he still fits the bill, pretty well, in the role of man-hunter. There is enough action to keep up the pace and more than adequate acting skill, by the supporting cas,t ably to reinforce the stars performance.<br />Those who have never seen the movie, and who like action thrillers, should enjoy this one.  Those who have not seen it for some time, should be able to see it again with almost all the initial pleasure.</p></body></html>

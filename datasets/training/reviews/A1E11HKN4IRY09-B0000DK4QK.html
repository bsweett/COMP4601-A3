The coolest thing about the Jack the Ripper legend is that no one ever truly knew his identity.  The movie itself was very well directed and production design superb, but the plot declaring that the ripper was basically a government hitman and his murders just conspiracy cover-up took the creepiness out of the story itself.  Are Free-Masons really that wacked?  Don't know, don't care.  Maybe they will make a really cool movie about Saucy Jack someday, because this isn't it.</p></body></html>

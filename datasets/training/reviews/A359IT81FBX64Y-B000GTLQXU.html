<meta name="summary" content="A Titanic blockbuster"></head><body><p>The producers of this movie may believe that all the special effects make it unsinkable, but after hitting multiple icebergs of bad plot, bad dialogue, bad character development, even bad background music and a bad torch song, it sinks like a lead zeppelin. The special effects were fine, but I can't say they were better than the special effects in the 1972 version. I can't believe that the same director who did Das Boot and The Perfect Storm did this; it is not Wolfgang Petersen's style to keep things moving from one special effects crisis to the next. This film is the most pathetic so far this year, and I hope it doesn't even garner any special effects Oscar nominations; it's better left on the bottom of the sea and forgotten. There may be survivors in the story, but there are none in the audience.</p></body></html>

His sweetheart Julia (Michelle Monaghan) thinks he works for the Department of Transportation...<br /><br />When one of his pupils is kidnapped by a sadistic arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Hunt decides to assemble his old team to retrieve her, putting in mortal danger his new love...<br /><br />J.J. Abrams--in his first feature film--shot "Mission: Impossible III" with a sense of timing and suspense... We're dealing with full-flash blanks, glass breaking, explosions... And we see Hunt, in a quite interesting shot, running up a wall to enter the Vatican... Also, in the bridge sequence, he runs away from a rocket hit on one of the vehicles... It's cool because the way he's running, the look on his face, before, during and after that impact could only have been done only by an actor as good as him... In China, in an old fishing village, we see him jumping off tile rooftops, with incredible grace, precision, coordination and footwork... Then, with Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell) they jump out of a building on a cable landing on a truck...<br /><br />The special effects, and visual effects are great... They all work together... The Shanghai street chase with Tom leaning out of the car at some insanely dangerous angle to shoot a gun under a truck; Also Tom, in a high-speed boat, on the Tiber River in Rome, Italy; the blowing of a nice spectacular sports car; and, of course, the helicopter chase sequence where, in pursuit, the bad-guy helicopter emerges out of a fireball...<br /><br />Also, in a fantastic shot, in Shanghai, China, when the camera comes in and then goes around Tom as he's standing on top of a Shanghai roof... The camera comes over his shoulder and look down at the ground, so we'll see Tom on the top of the Shanghai building, hundreds feet in the air, and just to show and set up the jeopardy of what he's about to accomplish...<br /><br />Well, I loved the director's work... He's so detail-oriented...The fun, the adventure, the creativity, never eased up...<br /><br />And, please, don't miss Colleen Atwood, entering the Vatican, with a head-turner red dress...</p></body></html>

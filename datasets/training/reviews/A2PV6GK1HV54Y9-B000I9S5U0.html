<meta name="summary" content=""I've come to pray for Jim.""></head><body><p>Based on the true life story of Depression Era boxer, James Braddock, Cinderella starring Russell Crowe as Braddock is a heartfelt and stunning achievment in cinematic history. Renee Zellweger plays Mae, Jim's wife, who stands by him no matter what. In the beginning, the couple and their three small children are happy, healthy, and rich but then the Great Depression strikes, their world is turned upside down. They are forced to live in a tiny apartment, they power is turned off, and one of their children is taken ill by lack of nutrition. The only reason I can't give this film 5 stars is that Cinderella Man can be slow at times, some of the boxing scenes are kind of boring but if you are a guy, of course you'll love those scenes, but overall, the film is classy, enchanting, and inspiring. Crowe and Zellweger are perfection together. Too bad this film wasn't recognized by the Academy, rent or buy this film today.</p></body></html>

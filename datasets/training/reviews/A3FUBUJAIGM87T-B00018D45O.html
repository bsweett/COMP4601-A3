<meta name="summary" content=""Do you mind getting the [bleep] out of my way there, son?" - The Sheriff"></head><body><p>When my brother and I saw the previews for the remake of the 1974 seminal horror movie called "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", I just could not wait to see it on the big screen.  After having seen the original "TCM", my now ex-wife refused to go with me to see the remake.  However, had she gone, she would not have hoped to see less of the madness and the macabre that she would have seen that day especially when compared to the original classic.<br /><br />First, it should be noted that the original is indeed much scarier, much better, much more powerful and intense and a much more effective overall horror movie than the remake.  In fact, the old "TCM" still ranks as one of the very best horror movies ever made.<br /><br />That said, "2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is a fairly solid horror movie through and through...I give this movie a solid 3 STARS and that is excellent from me, especially considering today's garbage that has been consistently pumped out of Hollywood over the last 10-15 years.  Of course, the remake is not without warts, not the least of which is that ridiculously absurd seen where the Jessica Biehl's character, Erin, (forgettable character) chops off Leatherface's arm with relative ease. I can't stop laughing every time I see that ridiculous scene...it's pathetic!<br /><br />As far as the story goes, the remake of "TCM" starts out much the same way as the old "TCM".  Those in the audience who have actually seen the original "TCM" become quickly aware of the absence of the terrific character of "Franklin", the invalid brother of Sally in the original "TCM".  I think that the absence of "Franklin" from the remake hurt this movie's effectiveness because Franklin was the most interesting and dynamic character of the young people that are introduced to the audience at the beginning of the original "TCM".  In a sense, Franklin's character and his personality sets a morbid and ghastly tone for what the audience is in for in the original and this theme is sorely lacking in the remake.  Also lacking in the remake is the terrifying score of the original that was so effective in establishing the deathly mood of the original classic.<br /><br />Unlike the original, the remake relies on this young crowd of "wild" twenty-somethings and the audience discovers quickly that Erin is the moral protagonist of the story.  The movie moves along to a scene where a strange girl is picked up by our young unsuspecting young people...this girl is very strange indeed as it becomes obvious to the audience that this girl has suffered some extreme emotional trauma.  What happens next is somewhat predictable yet very disturbing as the girl commits suicide in the van...the young people are naturally very upset and Erin demands that they contact the police.  Hence, the plot is set into motion.  At this point, it becomes clear that the remake is attempting to deviate from the original classic at least to some degree, although such deviation is not near as effective as the hitchhiker scene in the orginal classic which is far more harrowing than the hitchhiker in the remake.  What is perhaps most obvious about this movie is the fact that the original "TCM" feel or atmosphere is completely absent in the remake, and this is not a good thing either.<br /><br />However, as the plot develops, the sheriff, who actually comes to the help of our hopelessly lost 20-somethings, is not your everyday law man and, in fact, it becomes apparent that this man is actually quite dangerous and very disgusting in his manner.  Meanwhile, Erin and Kemper have gone for help elsewhere and visit a house where a very dangerous presence awaits them.  In their attempt to use the phone, Kemper and Erin are confronted by a very abrasive man in a wheelchair, who is noticeably absent in the original.<br /><br />Basically, Erin and her friends are being tricked into a situation of madness and macabre the likes of which they have never nor wanted to witness.  Leatherface and a crazy family of evil scum attacks Erin and her friends and what was a joyful ride to see a "Lynard Skynard" concert becomes a deadly fight for survival against an unremorseful and downright disgusting enemy who wants these young people for their very flesh.<br /><br />The remake of "TCM" provides the audience with a lot more gore than the original, but does that make it better?  Absolutely not, the original "TCM" had the intrinsic morbid and dark atmosphere with an underlying sense of evil and madness that the new "TCM" of 2003 does not even come close to attaining.  Sure, the gore is effective and the villains including "Leatherface" are quite terrifying in their own right with their violent manner and appearance.  However, the absence of the hitchhiker and the cook is clearly a minus for the remake as these were essential characters in the original classic.  Their absence in the remake hurts this movie significantly.<br /><br />The potential to create terror in the audience is there in the remake, at least at times; and, at times, this movie is very effective in doing that, but the lack of the morbid, dark and macabre-like atmosphere so evident in the original but so lacking in the remake hurts the new "TCM" and represents the tremendous difference between the two movies.  The acting in the original is essential to creating the TCM-feel or atmosphere which is missing in the remake, although the acting in the remake is adequate, and the actor who played "the sheriff" does an outstanding job in his role notwithstanding the character's intrinsic inferiority to the original's "the cook" who most closely resembles "the sheriff" although the characters are definitely different but from the same mold.<br /><br />However, in my opinion, the acting is actually better in the original "TCM" because the acting is essential to the atmosphere that Tobe Hooper creates in the original, and the villains in the original are absolutely terrifying in their: ghastly, maddening, disgusting, cold-blooded and evil nature.  The acting in the remake, as I said above, is adequate and at times good, but it fails to set the tone in the remake like the acting was able to do in the original classic, and I think this is a testament to Tobe Hooper's brilliance as a director.<br /><br />There is no question that the villains in the old "TCM" are much more powerful, intense and more naturally horrifying in a very realistic way than the villains in the new "TCM"...hence, this terrifying atmosphere of the old "TCM" is not present in the 2003 version.  Still, the acting and directing of the remake are pretty good overall and the movie is quite entertaining...there are some good death scenes and there is a sense of terror that the audience can relate to in this movie.  After all, what's more terrifying than redneck scum that have absolutely no regard for the sanctity of human life and have every intention of obtaining human flesh for their consumption?<br /><br />Now, as I have indicated above, the only completely stupid scene in the entire "2003 TCM" is when Erin literally chops off Leatherface's arm with a cleaver which is absolutely ridiculous because it would not have been physically possible for her to perform such an act under those circumstances or perhaps any circumstances...that was absurd and brings the movie down.  Also, I thought the movie was a bit anti-climatic.  Last and least of all criticism would be the obvious attempts to focus on Jessica Biehl's attractiveness as a female...that takes away from the purity and effectiveness of the movie itself as a horror movie.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the new "2003 TCM" remake and I recommend it to true horror movie fans as it is a good horror movie which is so much better than most of today's modern trash, but, that being said, I must point out to my fellow horror movie fans and friends, and trust me when I say this and that is, "there is nothing like the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and this remake is a far cry from the horror, madness and macabre that the audience experiences after watching the original classic called "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre".  Inevitably, casual horror movie fans (especially those who have seen the remake before seeing the original) will unfortunately like the remake better, and this is a tragedy, but all I can do is try and educate those prospective viewers and lead them in the right direction (with this comparative review of the remake to the original classic "TCM") which is most definitely to the nearest DVD store to pick up the original classic and watch it several times before even looking at the remake.</p></body></html>

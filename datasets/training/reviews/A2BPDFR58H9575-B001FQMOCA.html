<meta name="summary" content="The story of Johnny and June"></head><body><p>I did not expect much of this bio-pic because I think it is almost impossible to make a good movie about an artist which not only shows the events of his life but also lets a viewer to take a peak inside that artist's mind to show the creative process with all its tension, uncertainty, selfishness and self-centering of an artist. In this regard, "Walk the Line" is nothing special but as a love story, it is wonderful from the first time young Johnny Cash and June Carter met during the show and she got strapped in his guitar until his proposal many years later on the stage (the only place she allowed him to talk to her). Both Phoenix and Witherspoon deserved the highest praise for their performances that were heartfelt, beautiful, sincere, and emotional. I never been a huge fan of Reese even though I always admitted that she had the acting talent ("Election") but with her role in "Walk the Line" and with her acceptance speech, she has earned my respect and admiration. Phoenix was as good as Reese and the chemistry between them was absolutely real.</p></body></html>

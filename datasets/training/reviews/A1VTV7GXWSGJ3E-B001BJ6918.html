While Vol. 1 was an action driven romp based on the old kung-fu style of filming, Vol. 2 is a more cerebral driven film based on the old spaghetti-western of the late 60's/early 70's. This is a slower paced movie, and as a result, a better plot-driven movie. You could say Volume 1 was merely a introduction to the main story of Volume 2.<br /><br />As with Volume 1, we are treated to a storyline that keeps jumping back-&-forth over a four-year period. After the climatic fight scene with O-Ren at the end of Volume 1 we start Volume 2 back at the masacure four years previously. We are finally introduced to Bill ( a voice only in Vol. 1), played nicely by David Carradine. And we get to see in detail the events that lead up to the masacure.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, Volume 2 is a slower-paced, plot-driven movie. Whereas Vol. 1 had three great fight scenes there is really only one decent fight scene here, between the Bride and Elle Driver (played surprising well by daryl Hannah). This fight probably has the most satisfying ending of all, which I won't give away. Just be forewarned, you could get a wee-bit squemish here. After eliminating Driver from the picture we are finally ready for the showdown between the Bride & Bill.<br /><br />Unfortunately, here is where the movie begins to drag, just a little. First, we have a scene in a Mexican Brothel where "Bea" finds out where Bill is. Then, we see her arrive at the hotel to discover that her daughter is still alive. Although this was a wonderfully played out reunion between Mother & daughter it only leads us to a long drawn-out scene between Bea & Bill where Tarantino must have felt he needed to tie up all loose ends. This part really was almost anti-climatic. We wait through approximately 15 minutes of explaination to see approximately 10 seconds of the climatic fight. It was a just wee-bit disappointing, I'm sorry to say.<br /><br />Still, I enjoyed the movie. And like the first, it is strangely additive. I would recommend it.</p></body></html>

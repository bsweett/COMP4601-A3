Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- December 25th, 2005<br /><br />Running Time- 104-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- R<br /><br />Writer/Director- Greg McLean<br /><br />Starring- Cassandra Magrath, Kestie Morassi, Nathan Phillips and John Jarratt as Mick Taylor<br /><br />Wolf Creek has mostly received a passing grade from horror fans, but the biggest complaint is Wolf Creek is too slow and that sort of bothers me. Too many people complain that horror movies have become more about violence and gore and not enough set ups on the characters and that is where Wolf Creek strays from what the genre has become. Writer/Director Greg McLean could have taken the easy way out and loaded the movie with violence and gore rather than character development and had faceless victims in a faceless movie.<br /><br />But instead of being filled with a body count there are only three main characters and half the movie is focused on them and it's really not until the final 40-minutes is when the action kicks in. It just bothers me what people complain about in the genre isn't here and yet people still feel the need to complain. I thought the first half of Wolf Creek was excellent in setting up the characters and getting to know them and that's what elevates the 2nd half. And actually if anything I'd say any pacing problems were more in the 2nd half rather than the first.<br /><br />The screenplay by Greg McLean was quite solid; the main characters are well developed and also very likeable. They come across as real people and that's what helps keep Wolf Creek strong despite the lack of action. Like I said McLean could have easily taken the easy way out and created a slew of characters and have them knocked off in gruesome ways. But instead we only have three characters and they are developed rather than being killed off one by one. The villain Mick Taylor played by John Jarratt was an excellent villain. The problem with movies like Wolf Creek is the villains are often too likeable and that does create a problem.<br /><br />Mick Taylor is actually quite funny and entertaining, but he's also really creepy and scary. And when he's being funny it's also really creepy. I suppose the best way to describe him is sort of like the characters in Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Like Taylor, they were funny in a really creepy way. Sometimes people who are insane are actually funny in the things they say and do. Not that I laugh at people with mental illness, but they can be funny. And Mick Taylor is funny, but there is something really sinister underneath and the flaw that often brings movies like Wolf Creek down is avoided.<br /><br />Wolf Creek was the feature film debut by Greg McLean and he handles it like a pro; the pacing of the movie early on was slow, but not in a bad way. It's slow paced, but never boring and the time spent with the characters greatly adds to the movie when the action kicks in. McLean takes his time getting to the action when he could have taken the easy way out and made a splatter flick. While the characters aren't the most developed I've see, but they are some of the most likeable and feel like real people and McLean is able to create a sense of looming danger even when nothing is really happening.<br /><br />The 2nd half is when the action kicks in and there was a lot of hype on how disturbing it was, which is sort of true. Wolf Creek is inspired by a true story and you can also see the 70s exploitation film influence as well and maybe I've just seen too many, but for me while it was twisted it's not like what was made out to be, but than again when you've seen enough of these movies it gets harder and harder to shock the viewer. But with that said the scenes in the 2nd half do pack a heavy punch, which has more to do with the viewer invested into the characters and when these terrible things happen to them again it may not be the most shocking, but works on a twisted level due to the amount of time we've spent with the characters.<br /><br />McLean delivers some solid suspense and tension and is able to craft some really dark scenes and the first major character to die was one of the greatest scenes this genre has ever seen. As excellent as the scene was the power lies more with the fact we've gotten to know the character. Though any pacing problems I found more in the 2nd half rather than the first half. There were a few moments in the 2nd half where it slightly dragged, but very little. McLean manages to keep things running smoothly.<br /><br />The acting was solid and the characters as well, which I mentioned before. Nathan Phillips is solid as Ben and Cassandra Magrath as Liz and Kestie Morassi as Kristy were both likeable and sympathetic. But the true star was John Jarratt as Mick Taylor who delivers one of the greatest horror performances and possibly the best of the decade. Like I said earlier the problem with a lot of these movies is the villain is often too likeable and while Jarratt is funny at times he's still creepy and again like I said before even when funny he's still creepy. Mick Taylor is cruel and vile and Jarratt plays the role to perfection.<br /><br />The biggest complaint for Wolf Creek was the first half was too slow, which I simply don't understand. Unlike most movies of this type or horror films in general Wolf Creek takes it's time and sets up the characters and that is what makes the 2nd half so powerful. Wolf Creek is an excellent horror flick and one of the very best of the decade.</p></body></html>

Trouble is, this is actually a ruse by former teammate Carl Weathers, to do some shameless weeding of gun runners south of the border, and the "honorable mercenary" Arnie is justifiably miffed for getting duped. More trouble is that the preceeding team of Soldiers were inexplicably wiped out and skinned by what we soon to discover is a very formidable (and not human) opponent. The action turns here into an escape movie, as Arnie and his team try to make there way to safety, and are hunted by the alien "Predator" of the title. The action is thick & fast, the special effects visceral, and the language more than colorful. This is a macho romp sure, but a good one - regardless of how over the top the characters are made out to be, the acting performances are spot on. Best of all is that this was a "scary" movie, that had you on the edge of your seat, and was gory and frightening to boot. Perhaps it is a sign of the times, that even with the advances in CGI, if this were made today, it would be a watered down version carrying a PG tag, attempting to make more money by reaching a wider audience(like this years Alien vs Predator). Maybe I'm wrong, but this is a horror film folks, should anybody under 17 be watching anyway??. The DVD itself is a let down, and looks like it should be in a cardboard sleeve in a dollar store - that's a real shame. If you want to see Arnie at his bone crunching and predictable best - this is it - Great Movie. Enjoy</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Is this a horror film.....I'm not so sure"></head><body><p>I watched "Emily Rose" when it first came out on DVD a year or so back, but for the life of me could't remember it? This past weekend I dug the DVD out of the closet for another view.<br />While there are some spooky and eerie images found in the film, the movie actually plays out more like a "Law & Order" episode than a horror film. And while Emily Rose gets titled billing, the story really focuses on the Laura Linney attorney character Erin Bruner, and her journey from skeptic to believer. The cast does a really great job, Jennifer Carpenter does a good job as the title character and Tom Wilkinson strikes a perfect chord as the priest accused of allowing Emily to die while under his care.<br />But, if you are in the mood for a horror film, you may want to pick up something else. "Emily Rose" is a decent courtroom drama, along the lines of "A Few Good Men", except in this film, the case deals with possible demonic possession as opposed to a marine's death.<br />It's not a bad film by any means, well directed, and does its best to maintain a spooky mood (but doesn't quite achieve that goal). If you are looking for straight up horror look elsewhere.</p></body></html>

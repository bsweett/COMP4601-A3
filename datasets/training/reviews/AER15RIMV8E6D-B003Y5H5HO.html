<meta name="summary" content="Rooney Mara Saved the Movie For Me!!!"></head><body><p>I don't why I wanted to see this. I've never read the book or seen the original Swedish movie. I know they wanted to establish character development for Daniel Craig's character, Mikael, and Lisbeth Salander but it took forever for something interesting to finally happen. The film is told by two story lines at first, then finally meet up at about 90 minutes in. First off, I thought Daniel Craig's storyline was a little boring. He's asked by a man named Henrik to solve the murder of his niece that happened 40 years earlier. (You can have a drinking game when Daniel Craig puts his glasses on and takes them off every time he finds another piece of the puzzle) Then we have Rooney Mara's hot awkward Gothic character, Lisbeth Salander. I loved her storyline and her character. She is the only good thing about this movie. She's a computer hacker that deals with mental issues and rape. Later in the movie, she becomes Mikael's assistant in finding a murderer. I probably wouldn't recommend THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO!!!</p></body></html>

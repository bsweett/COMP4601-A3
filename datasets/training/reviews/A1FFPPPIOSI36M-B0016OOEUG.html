I know it may be because of the era, but this movie more resembles a play than a cinematic movie. I found nothing visually interesting or beholding here.<br /><br />The story is a murder mystery that takes a 90 degree turn in the middle of the movie...which takes the air out of the whole "mystery" aura. It's really not a mystery amyway since the perpetrator can be narrowed down to only 4 suspects.<br /><br />This movie consists of a murder victim, her trustfund-baby lover (Vincent Price in a very different role for what he would be later known for) , her obviously gay, svengali-like mentor, a devoted housekeeper and an extremely instrusive detective. Each charactor is horribly annoying and spewing out dialogue that is not only unbelievable but also completely intolerable to a normal person. I know in a "film noir", the viewer should accept the quirks for what they are but the dialogue and mannerisms are so utterly ridiculous.<br /><br />The most appealing aspect of the film is the actress who plays "Laura", Gene Tierney. Holy Smokes was she gorgeous and elegant looking. What is fascinating is that she is the voice of reason within the film but, I believe, she suffered from mental illness and led a tragic life after this film.<br /><br />I caught this on cable and TeeVoed it. I watched it because this is considered a must see, "classic" film. In that I watched it late night (my only opportunity), I was only able to watch it in 30 minute increments before I started to doze off. Consider that a warning/sneak preview.</p></body></html>

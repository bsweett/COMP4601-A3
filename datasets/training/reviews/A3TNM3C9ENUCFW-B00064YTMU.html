<meta name="summary" content="Pacy Thriller let down by Predictable outcome"></head><body><p>I was looking forward to seeing this movie after the hype, and found Cruise and Foxx to be both believable and talented in their  respective roles. A brief synopsis finds hard working and "nice" cab driver Max (Foxx) being unwittingly hired for the evening by ice cold mystery man Vincent (Cruise), and then dropped knee deep into an assassination spree, from which he is inextricably trapped. After a moderately slow start, the story builds nicely, with some intelligent plot work, good action sequences, and promises much in suspense, action, and the ability to hold your attention. Somewhere in the middle of the movie this gets lost, and even the most innatentive of viewers will see what's coming next from a mile away, and that's a real shame. Cruise and Foxx play off each other nicely, and there's a strange attraction to Cruises meticulous character, despite his sociopathic tendencies, and ice cold indifference to his victims. This is not a bad movie, but let's itself down with some avoidable mistakes, the main one being to revert to unlikely and implausible outcomes, just to reach the desired ending it self telegraphed earlier. Questions you may find yourself asking are: (DANGER SPOILER AHEAD)<br /><br />1. The US Attorney general building is guarded by one solitary guard, and otherwise uninhabited?<br />2. Despite numerous security features in the building, Max is able to gain entry by simply walking through a side door?<br />3. Max can run, jump and arrive to save the day from half a mile away on a parking lot roof, before Vincent can go from the 14th to the 16th floor in the same building?<br />4. Three armed FBI units, a night club security team, LAPD, and a South American Druglords hit squad ALL in the same building with weapons drawn, ALL miss the target?<br /><br />These are just a few discrepancies, in an otherwise tight and pacy thriller, but given that a multitude of better directions with the story could have been taken, the one chosen is a disappointment. Good movie, but NOT great. Enjoy</p></body></html>

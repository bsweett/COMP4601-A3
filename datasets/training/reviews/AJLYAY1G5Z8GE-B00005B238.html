<meta name="summary" content="Predator Is Just A Great Alien Character!"></head><body><p>A special army forces team head to the jungle at a rescue mission and defeat one opponent army unit magnificently. On their way back, they are faced with the Predator, an alien that got attracted to all the action that was going on with them. He hunts them one after the other and finally gets to Arnold.<br /><br />I just love the superiority of the Predator character. In this movie he hunts down the army, and in the second he hunts down the police.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="'The Thing' on Blu Ray"></head><body><p>This movie destroys, completely, the contention that because the Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, and Rambo movies are so old that, even on Blu Ray, grain and artifacts are to be expected.  "The Thing' starring Kurt Russell is older than all of them, coming out in 1982.  I remember seeing it for the first time on a VHS rented tape on a tiny 19" TV with its tinny speakers, and it still gave my ex wife and a friend the chills making us jump in surprise at many scenes.<br /><br />'The Thing' on Blu Ray brags of an excellent video and audio transfer, and it can keep on bragging.  The Video transfer couldn't be any better.  The colors pop, even the blacks.  In the beginning of the movie there is a scene of the radio room, and the back of the hand held transmitter displays a deep reflective black that is rare.  I saw no grain, artifacts or anything else that would take away from this fine transfer.<br /><br />The DTSHD audio was as clean as one could hope for with excellent steering to the discreet channels where appropriate.  I was surprised that, for most of the movie, there was very little of the LFE channel coming into action, however, as I said, the audio is lossless and quite wonderful.<br /><br />I have had the Standard Def disc for some time now, but am ultra pleased that I bought the blu ray version.  There are no extras on this disc other than the directors commentary so don't expect to find anything but an exciting film transferred to Blu Ray in the best way possible.  With the low price, what a great bargain.  If you thought this review was useful click on 'of help' to let me know.  Thanks</p></body></html>

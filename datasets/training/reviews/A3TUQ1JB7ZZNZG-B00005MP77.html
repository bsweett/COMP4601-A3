<meta name="summary" content="One of the best films ever......."></head><body><p>One Saturday afternoon my parents went out and left me in the house all alone, and they had just bought me a copy of Night of the Living Dead to keep me busy. I rarely get scared at black and white horror films (Exception-Psycho) but this movie had me jumping around like a fool by the end. Night of the Living Dead was directed by George A Romero who hit with two other sequels in this same field. Shot on a shoe string budget of just over,$110,000,it is the story of the dead coming back to life and eating the living. However that is just the start. In the beginning we meet Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and her brother Johnny (Russell Streiner) and they are attacked in a cemetery where they have come to put flowers on there fathers grave. After Johnny is killed Barbara runs to a nearby farm house. A man passes in looking for gas named Ben (Duane Jones) and he decides that they should just stay put and board up the house for protection. More people show up like the cantancorous Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman),his long suffering wife Helen (Mayilyn Eastman),their daughter who had been bitten by a ghoul, and a young couple who is just scared. Ben and Harry hate one another from the outset and continue to fight throughout the film.<br />Night of the Living Dead works on many different levels and in the end it is just a really good horror movie, but it also say's somthing about the fact that no matter how bad things are outside, inside we still can't get along. The acting is very good,(Eastman,Hardman,And Streiner all worked off camera as well and were there from the biggining) and the violence is not very graphic although it is at time a little disturbing but if you see Dawn Of The Dead or Day Of The Dead, or even the remake of this film you will be amazed at just how tame it is compared to those others. This is the film that started all the zombie movies and it has never come close to being equeled. Most of the Zombie movies that come out now are nothing more than an excuse show how much blood and gore they can pack into 97 Minutes (See Lucio Fulci's Zombie if you don't believe me).<br />A remake made of thius film in the early 90's by make-up wizard Tom Savini that was a really bad movie. He should have left well enough alone and remade Plan 9 From Outer Space, at least then we would have seen his movie being intentionally funny........</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good Docudrama..."></head><body><p>I sympathize with the Royal Family.  They don't choose to be Royals.  They have very little choice what they do with their lives, really.  They can't vote, they can't run for office, and they can't be anonymous.  The worst part is that nobody else seems to have any sympathy for them because they have so much money.  As we all know, money buys happiness.<br /><br />This is a docudrama, mostly about the week after Princess Diana's death.  Diana and several other characters in the movie "appear as themselves," as it were, through news footage.  For that reason, we never see the two princes, even though much of the movie concerns them, and they are at Balmoral when the action takes place.  Their absence is a bit too conspicuous.<br /><br />The drama comes from Tony Blair's desperate attempts to get the Queen to make more of a fuss over Diana's death.  To him, it is a no-brainer: the public is terribly upset and want their Queen to help them with their grief.  To Elizabeth II, it is all hype.  Why should the flag fly at half-mast at Buckingham Palace, when that isn't even done for people who still are part of the Royal Family?  The Queen must come to terms with the cult of celebrity.<br /><br />The Queen and Tony Blair (ironically) are the most sympathetic characters in the movie.  Charles and Philip are played as buffoons, which I did not particularly care for.  These are complex people and, truth be told, we will never really know what life is like for that family, no matter how much we'd like to believe otherwise.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="And I liked it! I liked it...All that dirty touching..........."></head><body><p>My caption is from this film and said with such power<br />from the one of a kind Piper Laurie(HI PIPEY)I LOVE<br />HORROR films and unfortunatly us AMAZON/HORROR fanatics<br />really don't have much to choose from,but when we do<br />have a JEWEL like this film it is so refreshing!<br />CARRIE(76)Is without a doubt ONE of thee greatest<br />HORROR films of ALL time.The directing is flawless<br />(what else would you expect from the man DePalma)<br />The cast is top notch and the story(KING'S FIRST)<br />Is amazing and scary at the same time.DePalma tells<br />the story of Carrie who is a pretty girl(though she<br />does not think so)and has no self esteem do in part<br />to her CRAZY religious mother.She has no friends and<br />with the exception of GOD and her mother has no one to<br />talk to.She does however have a power,the power to<br />move objects(telakineses,I spell wrong)This is such a<br />FANTASTIC movie.DePalma gives us DRAMA-ACTION-ROMANCE<br />COMEDY,and of course HORROR.You feel for Carrie when<br />she is at the prom and is Cinderella and you feel for her<br />at the FALL of BLOOD! I am not one to cry at movies but<br />DAMN! DePalma and Spacek for the scene"HOLD ME MAMMA,PLEASE<br />HOLD ME..For I was NIAGRA FALLS(maybe it was smokey in my<br />house..though I don't smoke) The ending is still a punch<br />and will not tell(for those of you who have not seen it and<br />if you have not"WAKE UP")This movie is GOLD!Also the music<br />is FLAWLESS Please see,BUY CARRIE it is A MASTERPIECE!!!!!<br />Also recommend for you lovers of movies to check out other<br />DePalma films for he is ONE of our greatest directors.<br />Check out my friend R.A.Bean's column on the GREAT DePalma<br />for he not only breaks down his work in a professional<br />manner but gives insight to those who are blind to film<br />making.LONG LIVE CARRIE! "SAY IT WOMAN!EVE WAS WEAK!<br />"RED....I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WOULD BE RED........<br />NOTE:I hate remakes(OH! I DO)but also recommend<br />the remake CARRIE for Angela Bettis alone(moochie-moochie)!</p></body></html>

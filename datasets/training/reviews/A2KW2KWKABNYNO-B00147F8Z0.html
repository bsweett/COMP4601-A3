Predator/The Future Governor Movie, also has a fun place in my book. Flash-forward to this unfortunate movie, and the franchise of both characters are utterly destroyed like the nuclear bomb at the end. Real actors? We can use bad/obscure ones! Character building? Who needs it! Gore? Got it! Shock? You'll be horrified!<br /><br />In fact, the only actor I found recognizable is childhood Shawn from the TV show Psych, and an alien leeches on his face and pops out of his stomach... This is a 10-year old kid we're talking about! But why stop there? How about a particularly disturbing scene where an Alien pops out of a pregnant woman, or an Alien finds himself in maternity ward? It's just simply disgusting. Because let's face it, they dumbed it down to today's disgrac... distasteful group of teens. There's teen sex, the blonde bimbo, the gore, and yes, all the intelligence of a gnat is used in this movie. I mean, the majority of the movie is set in a dark, rainy town where it's hard to see any of the action.<br /><br />Overall, if you're a teen, or not a fan of these franchises, or somebody that likes mindless horror films, in more ways than one, then this is the movie for you. For the rest of us "normal" people, don't see this, because you'll be regretting it if you do. By the end, I felt like I had an Alien popping out of my stomach. By the way, what would the citizens of Colorado think of having a nuke dropped in their state? There goes the tourism dollars!</p></body></html>

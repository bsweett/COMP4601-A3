<meta name="summary" content="The movie that sparked the summer blockbuster phenomenon"></head><body><p>28 years ago this summer, an almost-unknown director named Steven Spielberg, at the ripe old age of 25, released a film that caused a stampede at the box office and single-handedly started the phenomenon of the summer blockbuster with "legs", the movie you had to see again and again and again.  Even after all this time, the ominous opening music from "Jaws" still sends a delicious tingle down the spine.  Spielberg's genius lay in turning Peter Benchley's mediocre novel into a well-acted, well-directed, terrifying classic horror movie.  He omitted all the boring side dramas that cluttered up the book and stuck to the bare bones; i.e., the primeval battle between man and a monster fish packing two hundred teeth and an attitude.<p>"Jaws" has more than a little in common with "Moby Dick", especially in Quint's fatal error in making his battle with the shark a personal vendetta, as Ahab did in his hunt for the white whale.  Just as the whale does in "Moby Dick", the shark turns the tables on its hunters and begins hunting them.  We see all of Quint's hubris brought low from the time he swaggers onto the deck of his own boat, monarch of all he surveys, until he ends up being relentlessly chewed up and swallowed by his nemesis.  Spielberg brings all this to us in vivid detail and reminds us that, after all, sharks will be sharks.<p>Spielberg has a gift for humorous touches as well, and he's a master at contrast.  I still crack up over the scene where the two boys scared the bejesus out of several hundred people in fake shark outfits; the laughter turns to horrified gasps immediately in the next scene, in which a hysterical girl points out the real shark only a few hundred feet upstream, ready to chow down on an unsuspecting guy in a rowboat.  The scene with the boneheaded mayor goggle-eyed in outrage at a defaced beach poster, blind to the reality of the threat out in the water, is a howler.  And the scene in which Quint smashes the boat's radio with a stick, effectively cutting off their communication with the outside world, is a masterpiece; the dawning terror in Quint's eyes, when he realizes that it's just them alone with the shark, and he finally realizes what an unequal contest it is, underlines all the folly of setting himself up against a power so much stronger than he is, that he can't hope to understand it, let alone defeat it.<p>So how has this film stood up over the past quarter-century?  Leave the mechanics of the shark's workings out of it; sure, they can do it better now with better technology.  The film still delivers on its premise; it's still one helluva horror movie.</p></body></html>

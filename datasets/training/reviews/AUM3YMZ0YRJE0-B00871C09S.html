We have more than a dozen of his films in our collection, which draw us in for a forget-the-world experience of suspense and drama.  OK, the characters are not necessarily all that deep, but there is a engaging quality to the films that is a magic all its own.<br /><br />Because of the static setting of the film, this is one of the last ones we watched.  It starts slow, with a relationship that is fraught with tension:  Grace Kelly wants Jimmy Stewart, but he is holding back - because she is too perfect, he says, but also because he fears a basic incompatibility.  She is a fashion and social goddess, he a news mag photographer who is convalescing after an injury sustained by standing in the middle of a race track.  She wants him to stay in NYC and take up fashion photography, where they can go to the finest places, he doubts she would want to give up that world and travel to the jungles of Asia with him.  Kelly, who is absolutely stunning in her prime and reeks of NYC sophistication, is wooing him, the doubter, the pursued one.  With a hip cast, all he has to do is watch his neighbors, quite a roster of characters.<br /><br />THere is Raymond Burr in an unhappy marriage, lonely women, and a newlywed couple, who are active behind closed shades all the time (though the new husband shows signs of reluctance and fatigue.)  It is a wonderful social observation of a happening neighborhood, The Village.  Soon, he observes what he thinks is strange, and has trouble convincing Kelly, a detective pal, and his nurse that something is really going on.  However, with so many signs, Kelly begins to participate, in a way to prove to him that she is not what he thinks she is.  An adventure, largely just observed by Stewart from his room, ensues that builds to a frightening climax.  If ever you doubt that Hitchcock has a certain genius, you have to experience this.  There are also flashes of humor and sexual innuendo.<br /><br />There are also excellent critical reviews and documentaries of the restored version, which add to the excellence of this dvd.<br /><br />Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.  Hitchcock is perhaps the only "old" film director that my kids consistently love.</p></body></html>

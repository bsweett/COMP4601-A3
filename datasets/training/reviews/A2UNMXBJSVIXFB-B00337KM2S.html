Right now, I'm taking a course on Civic Engagement & The Power of Social Capital, then another on Business Anthropology. Civic Engagement basically teaches us that society as a whole isn't what it used to be; people are more isolated these days, technology has made us inexplicably more distant from one another, and there just isn't much of a human connection anymore, at least like there used to be in generations past. Business Anthropology is about the concepts of change and difference and how things (be they in life or the business world) are always evolving and need to adapt over time. Enter: Up in the Air, an incredibly accurate testament and indicative measure of the times we're currently living in and the complications that come with it. It's a story about how we choose to live our lives and is backed by a very clever analogy in "The Empty Backpack." Of all the material things we own and all the people we know and the baggage that comes with those relationships, do we really need to weigh ourselves down with that? Our dead-end jobs, friends, and family; is there really a point to having all of these and keeping them close outside of what cultural norms tell us we need? On the other hand, if we didn't engage with one another and actually socialize from time to time, humanity certainly wouldn't be as welcoming and we all probably wouldn't have those friends and family to share some of the happier moments with. I think this movie does a brilliant job with its script and screenplay showing both the benefits and hindrances of choosing between the two lifestyles. Until this semester, I would actually say I was somewhere in-between, but leaning closer to the loner side. However, with these classes and now the viewing of this fine movie, I'd say I'm stuck back in the middle again, but with no real preference. Moderation and balance are always a good thing, right? And with that said, kudos to Jason Reitman for a very poignant film and to George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, and Anna Kendrick for some outstanding performances. Up in the Air may not be everyone's cup of tea, but for those interested in a "ground-based" (there's an oxymoron), slice-of-life drama, that's also a great psychological and character study about how society works, this is definitely worth a watch.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />Brought to you by Paramount in 1080p via the MPEG-4 AVC codec at an original aspect ratio of 1.85:1, Up in the Air is as perfect a picture as you will find. Colors are vibrant from the very beginning of the opening credits sequence and throughout the entire movie, separating clothes, backgrounds, skin tones, hair, lighting, etc. Detail and textures are also very distinct between people and objects, most notably for me between George Clooney and the many suits he wears and the patterns on both his and everyone else's business attire. Black levels are deep, though not amazingly so given there are very few instances of pure pitch blackness. Contrast is also excellent and compliments the fine layer of grain for a remarkably theatrical feel. There are also zero instances of artifacting, debris, and image manipulation. It's not reference material in the sense of wowing your guests, but flawless is still flawless.<br /><br />Audio - 4.5<br /><br />Some may find it odd to give a dialogue-driven character drama a 4.5 for audio, but even with its limited sound design, this DTS-HD track is surprisingly ample. Dialogue is clear with no dropout or volume issues, and what few ambient sound effects there are resonate accordingly from the front and side speakers. But the star of the audio is the music, which really supports the film as a whole emanating profusely from all speakers and creating a subtle, if not melancholy, mood to help convey the story. The only element obviously lacking, though, are any real levels of LFE output. There's one scene during a party that makes for some great bass in the on-screen music, but that's it.<br /><br />Extras - 2.0<br /><br />Armed with only a commentary track (a pretty good one) and deleted scenes (in HD, and also with good commentary), Up in the Air doesn't have much else aside from a couple of features about how they constructed the opening sequence and a storyboard comparison. I would really liked to have seen interviews from the rest of the staff, the author of the original book, or cast members about there thoughts on the film itself, but perhaps they thought the film wouldn't be as well-received enough, and hence, decided not to go through the trouble? That's a shame.<br /><br />Overall - 4.0<br /><br />While the extras are severely lacking, I'd still highly recommend this film for its outstanding story and A/V presentation. It's a story that I, personally, find very enduring and enjoyable thanks in part to its eloquent message about isolation, the benefits of companionship, the deteriorating affinity we have with one another, the impact of change, and just how important it is to see both sides of the coin when it comes to life. With outstanding direction and writing from Reitman, a subtle, yet fun script, exceptional performances by veterans Clooney and Farmiga, and a prominent job by Kendrick (who shows a lot of potential), Up in the Air is one of the finest character dramas I've seen in a while and should be one of the things you keep in your proverbial backpack.</p></body></html>

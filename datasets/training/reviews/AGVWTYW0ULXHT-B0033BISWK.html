<meta name="summary" content="Aliens in a refugee camp - inventive and gripping pseudo-documentary science fiction thriller"></head><body><p>A mysterious alien ship appears above Johannesburg, South Africa. The aliens aboard are weak and dying, and are eventually moved to a shabby refugee camp where they are feared and misunderstood by the locals, and taken advantage of by ganglords.  Meanwhile their technology is being studied by a multinational corporation that hopes to take advantage of their advanced weaponry.  When the timid bureaucrat Wikus is charged with leading an operation to transplant the "prawns" (as they are called by the locals) to a new camp, he is inadvertently drawn into their plight.<br /><br />District 9 represents a truly inventive and exciting new voice in science fiction, that at its best tends to exploit the ideas and resources of the genre (aliens, futuristic technology, alternate realities) in order to explore present day issues, such as how we tend to fear, abuse and exploit "aliens" on our own planet.  Or how our fears can make us vulnerable, and our ignorance makes us weak.  The film challenges us to ask what it means to be human, especially when we treat other intelligent beings as "other."  It's also a thrilling film, that kept me on the edge of my seat.  I loved that the main character was not an "action star" but a timid bureaucrat, both likable in his own way and betraying the prejudices of ignorance.  This is a cleverly written and intelligent film, that plays with the conventions of science fiction genre film by merging with documentary, but without quite falling into the "Blair Witch" or "Cloverfield" style shaky cam home movie realism.  A lot of fun to watch, and left me with lots to think about.</p></body></html>

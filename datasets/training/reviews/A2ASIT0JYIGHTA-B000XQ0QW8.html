<meta name="summary" content="M. Night Shyamalan films should be AVOIDED"></head><body><p>This movie had promise but QUICKLY went down hill.  Not even the likeable Bruce Willis could do much to save this ridiculous mess.  I'm so glad I borrowed it off a friend, rather than rent it.<p>M. Night Shyamalan films are not clever, artistic or even original.  He tries to make his films unique but they fail even before the middle of the film.  Just look at his other film called &quot;Signs&quot;.  Mel Gibson couldn't save that either.  Not even big names can help his movies.<p>Overall, far fetched nonsense films which don't deserve any of our attention.  I'll avoid his films from here on.</p></body></html>

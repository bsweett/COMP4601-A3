And it's no fault of Milla's, whose scenes with the child that she is protecting actually do evoke an emotional response to the parent in me.<br /><br />However, the rest of it is just plain awful, especially down to our nemesis.  At any moment, I expect one of his subordinates to hesitantly cut in, "Sir...ahemmmm...excuse me, sir?  That's not how you wear a nasal strip, sir.  You still snore at night."  Yes, I have a hard time not laughing at the bad guy, especially considering the amount of gratuitous olfactory close-ups that subject us to realizing that there is WIRE MESH on his "nose plugs" which supposedly keep him safe from harm.  Now that it's said, I need to tap the director on the shoulder in order for him to realize that he could still catch airborne illnesses through HIS MOUTH.  (rolls eyes and hammers desk triumphantly).<br /><br />Perhaps it would have been funnier if our "bad guy" had more lines with the letter "s" in it.  "Are you inthane?  How thupid are you?"<br /><br />Admittedly, the action scenes are incredible, but after about 10 minutes, one gets the impression that Violet is so invulnerable that any action scene involving her lacks the suspense to carry the action forward.  Her role is simply to dance around in a circle in a dazzling array of gunfire that takes everyone out and leaves her unscathed.  Somehow, her concern for her well-being seems entirely misplaced given that taking out 20 guys gives her a good workout and a couple stray stands of hair for "injuries."<br /><br />The effects and visuals are also a feast, but there are times it's overdone to the point of annoyance.  The whole scene involving Violet's ever-changing clothes and hair was downright exasperating and the part where the purple sparks dance from eyelid to eyelid almost made me inadvertently laugh--I'm sorry, was this Xanadu?!?  The over-saturated, candy-brilliant colors have been done before, as in "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow", not to mention others.<br /><br />The film starts off with Milla narrating:  "I come from a world that you may not understand."  The way she reads the line, one can almost hear it coming across apologetically.<br /><br />Give this film a decided, and earnest, MISS.</p></body></html>

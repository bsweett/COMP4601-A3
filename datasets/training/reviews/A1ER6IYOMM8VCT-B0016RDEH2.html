<meta name="summary" content="A MAGICAL AND HAUNTING FAIRY TALE FOR ADULTS!"></head><body><p>Most of you who read my reviews know I don't watch many films that are subtitled. I know, I know, I'm lazy, but it's really not that I'm lazy, it's that I find it a bit distracting. Fortunately this film is well worth reading subtitles for. For those of you not aware of this<br /><br />*** THIS FILM IS IN SPANISH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES!***<br /><br />This is a very well made film and beautifully told story. It has a nightmarish quality that will stick with you long after watching it. The film is nothing like I thought It would be and that is one of the reasons I put off watching this for so long. It's really a fantastic film and should not be missed by movie lovers.<br /><br />The film is definitely not for children as it has some graphic violence and it can be scary at times.</p></body></html>

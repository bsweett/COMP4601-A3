<meta name="summary" content="almost as good as the book"></head><body><p>Like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WZAE1I">Stardust (Widescreen Edition)</a>, I thought this movie captured the book almost better than the book itself did. I've read a lot of reviews complaining about the missing parts, but heck, that's what I've got the book for--if I want to read all the little details, I'll read the book. I view the movies as more of a companion to the books than a substitute for them, so I'm expecting things to be left out.<br /><br />The tone was suitably darker, more serious, and the actors are all well suited for their roles and convincing in them.<br /><br />I thought the movie shined where the book was weak: in particular, the scene where a certain character dies. In the book, it was glossed over, almost an afterthought--to the point where I didn't believe it. In the movie, it was clear what had happened.<br /><br />One wee pet peeve: what part of PG-13 do parents of toddlers not understand? I don't care if you let your toddler watch a PG-13 rated movie--well, as long as they're not screaming in the theater when I'm trying to watch--but for heaven's sake, quit complaining that it's too scary for them!</p></body></html>

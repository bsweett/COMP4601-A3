<meta name="summary" content=""On September 24th, you will be forgotten.""></head><body><p>"The Forgotten" is a creepy, chill-inducing, supernatural thriller that could've been a truly great film.  All of the elements are there; a strong cast (Julianne Moore, Dominic West, Gary Sinise), a fascinating plot, eerie music and cinematography, and enough on-screen jolts to leave you with an empty popcorn bag by film's end.<br /><br />The problem is this; the screenwriters set up such an enigmatic, mind-boggling story that it soon became apparent to me that a plausible, satisfying explanation would not be possible.  And I was right.  "The Forgotten" starts off with great promise but it ultimately has nowhere to go.  The script becomes so tripped-up in itself that it ultimately results to cheap, supernatural occurrences in order to explain away everything that's happened throughout the entire film.  I felt cheated.<br /><br />Once the filmmakers resort to a certain overly-used special effect to pull their picture out of a nosedive, "The Forgotten" shape-shifts from a psychological thriller to science fiction and lastly to comedy, and unintentional comedy at that.<br /><br />This wasn't easy film to bring together, I'm sure. The filmmakers tried to keep a balance between creepy weirdness and unbelievability. However, the final premise was just a little too silly to really believe. I was frustrated with this film because I think it actually backed itself into a corner, and then took the clich&eacute; out.<br /><br />Overall, "The Forgotten" is a truly frightening and entertaining film despite its glaring story problems.  I loved how I was getting goose bumps, jumping out of my seat, and yelping throughout the movie.  It was a fun, SCARY experience and I can unashamedly say that I enjoyed myself.</p></body></html>

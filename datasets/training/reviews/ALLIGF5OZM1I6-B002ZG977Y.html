Why does Perseus have a shaved head when everyone else in the film has the appropriate hairstyle for the time period? Why did they CGI Medusa? Why does Calibos look like he belongs in Wrong Turn rather than this film? Why does Hades walk with a staggered limp and have such a dramatic dry voice and a burnt scalp? Why does Zeus need to wear armor while sitting upon his throne in Olympus? Why did everyone feel the need to engrave abs into their armor? Were they really that bored? I know they didn't have cable or Nintendo back then, but come on! And lastly, why was this film re-made at all? It's a Saturday morning classic B-rate 80's flick and that's the way we like it. It's not a CGI infested Hollywood Blockbuster, and attempting to make it so, was a disappointment.<br /><br />But who knows - perhaps Clash of the Titans would have made a good huge Hollywood film, had they done it right. If they had stepped away from the cheesiness of the original altogether, and started fresh - maybe we'd have something. Instead, what we are left with is a sorry attempt and what feels like a collaboration between the corny appeal of the classic, breaded with special effects and this goes together about as good as lasagna and cocoa puffs would.<br /><br />Having never seen the original, my friend leaned over, about 10 minutes in and whispered in my ear, "Why does this feel like we're watching a bad 70's flick?" If memory serves, this was right around the time where Zeus' metal armor was ridiculously gleaming and shining at us like something out of a bad rock video. I smiled to myself and informed her, that we essentially were - as the original was released in 1981, and this version was caked with its long since dried-over cheese.<br /><br />The original is one of my favorite films. It's fantastic. It's a cult classic and is so bad, that is in turn so good; if that makes any sense at all! It's extra jam-packed-filled with B-rate dialogue, B-rate sets and of course, glorious old school stop animated sequences and corny props. Somehow, the giant scorpions looked more convincing in the original.<br /><br />Both films have almost the exact same story; the only major difference being that the orders of events have been randomly shuffled around to appear in a different sequence. And this new version offers Hades as the lead villain, when Calibos was the one causing havoc for Perseus in the original. He still appears here, but looks nothing like he did previously and is only in the film for a small amount of time.<br /><br />While I wasn't a fan of the haircut, even though it fits Sam Worthington every bit as Vin Diesel's fits him; Worthington still delivers a great performance as Perseus. He's a gifted actor and is only getting better.<br /><br />It's also no shocker that Liam Neeson makes for a good Zeus. If I had to picture what God would look like in the form of a man, it would be Neeson all the way. There is something truly majestic about the guy.<br /><br />Had I not recently seen Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightening Thief, maybe I would not have been so disappointed with the Medusa sequence Clash offers us; but I highly doubt it. In Percy Jackson, Medusa was brilliantly played by Uma Thurman and the CGI snakes that were her hair were astronomically more impressive.<br /><br />In addition to this, there was far more depth given to Uma's version of the character, throughout a stimulating scene of dialogue exchanged between her and Percy. No such scene is found in the Clash of the Titans and the CGI is weak and tiresome.<br /><br />The entire flow of Percy Jackson, was better executed and although each scene served primarily to set up the following scene as our hero marched on with his purpose much like Perseus does here; it never felt that way. Clash of the Titans spoon-feeds us one sequence after another like we are a newborn strapped in a highchair. We're not children; we can handle a little more drama. Which of these two films was aimed at kids again?<br /><br />The one thing Clash of the Titans got almost perfect was its climax. Very awesome CGI during the Kraken's scene. Amazing stuff here. Great water-swooping camera shots, and a lot going on at once and the thing was just great to watch as it emerged from the water to reek havoc.<br /><br />The only problem with this scene is that it seems like they spent so much money on making the Kraken look sensational, that they had none left to close the film out with. We go from the Kraken to what should have been an even bigger showdown, to the credits.<br /><br />If you can watch both films and compare them, then great; but if you have to choose between this film and Percy Jackson... I trust you know what to do.</p></body></html>

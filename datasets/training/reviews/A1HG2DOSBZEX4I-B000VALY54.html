<meta name="summary" content="Hip Funny California Noir"></head><body><p>Shane Black's directorial debut has a lot going for it: a good cast, fast paced action, witty dialogue. Unfortunately it also has an overly complicated plot line that has a tendancy to confuse more than it reveals.<br /><br />Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a small time crook who escapes a botched robbery into an audition for a detective film. Whisked off to Hollywood he is paired with a gay PI, Gay Perry (Val Kilmer) hired to get him ready for his casting call.  While in Hollywood he meets  an old flame Harmony Faith Lane (Michelle Monaghan) who gets him embroiled in a pulpish noir mystery.<br /><br />The film throws every cliche at its viewer that it can muster and the overly contrived plot gets somewhat tiresome but there is great dialogue here written by the man who created Lethal Weapon. The acting is good and the chemistry between Downey and Monaghan feels genuine.<br /><br />The disc presents a near perfect transfer but is a little lacking in extras. A four minute gag real and a commentary track with Black, Kilmer, and Downey are featured. This could have been a great film with a little work on the plot. As it stands it's a merely good film.<br /><br />Worth a rental for a few laughs.</p></body></html>

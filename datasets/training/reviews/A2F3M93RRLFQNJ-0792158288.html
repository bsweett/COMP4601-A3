<meta name="summary" content="On DVD at last"></head><body><p>This set of DVDs contains one of my all-time favorite movies and its two sequels.  On the merits of the original movie alone, this boxed set gets five stars.  The remainder is almost supplemental.<p>Raiders of the Lost Ark is a classic adventure movie, an almost flawless film that introduces Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, archaeology professor and treasure hunter in the 1930s.  Recruited by the government to find the Ark of the Covenant (containing the remains of the Ten Commandments), Jones soon runs afoul of the others seeking the Ark, in particular the Nazis and his arch-nemesis, Belloq.  Belloq is actually the best villain in the entire series, an amoral archaelogist whose ambition seems to be to become Jones, so he is always seeking to emulate Indy's professional and romantic successes.<p>Temple of Doom -easily the weakest of the three - is supposedly a prequel to Raiders.  It is not so much action-packed as action-crammed, with so much fighting and fleeing that there is no real time for any real characters.  The villains are second-rate and the cute kid sidekick is annoying, but most grating is Kate Capshaw's character who is thoroughly unpleasant and pales in comparison to the much more interesting Marion Ravenwood in the first movie.  There are also contradictions created by this movie taking place earlier than Raiders:  how can Indy be so skeptical of the supernatural in Raiders if he has previously undergone the Temple of Doom adventures?<p>The Last Crusade returns to the spirit of the original movie, bringing back old characters and situations.  Although there is no Marion, we do have Sean Connery as Indiana Jones's father.  The two of them are racing against the Nazis to find the Holy Grail.  If not quite as good as the original, it is still a decent movie.<p>This is not so much a trilogy as a series, the distinction being that a trilogy is essentially one long story (like Star Wars or the Matrix) and a series is a sequence of individual stories focused on the same characters (like James Bond or the Lethal Weapon movies).  As a series, each movie must be judged on it own merits, and as such, this is a set of one great, one good and one so-so movie.  The supplemental materials are interesting, but if you skip them, you aren't missing a whole lot.  Buy this set for Raiders (which you can't get by itself), and maybe The Last Crusade.</p></body></html>

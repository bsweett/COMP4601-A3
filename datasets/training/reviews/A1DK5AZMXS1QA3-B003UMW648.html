<meta name="summary" content="Great sequel"></head><body><p>This 2nd installment in the Narnia movie franchise picks up one year after the end of the first movie; in England time.  When our four heroes return to Narnia, it is actually a millenium later.  But the ensuing movie is just as exciting as the first one, with even some romance thrown in at the end.  Like any good fantasy movies, Prince Caspian has several grand battle scenes, creatures of various species interacting with each other in English, great swordfighting, and some double-crossing, both by good guys and by the bad guys.  All in all, a great 2+ hours of movie-watching experience.  Some of the movie does take part in the night, so turn of the lights while watching it.</p></body></html>

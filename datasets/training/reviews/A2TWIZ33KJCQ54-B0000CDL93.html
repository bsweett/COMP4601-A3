<meta name="summary" content="A MASTERPIECE ON FILM BUT NOT PERFECT TRUTH"></head><body><p>MY IMPRESSION - - INCREDIBLY WELL DONE DRAMATIZATION: BUT WHERE EXACTLY IS THE TRUTH?<br /><br />To evaluate this film fairly is like evaluating the book "State of Fear". If one agrees with the Author/Director's conclusions, the film or book is great. If not, it is garbage or worse, in one's opinion. I have chosen to treat both of these as prime examples of fictionalization. In that light, this film is terrific entertainment and does indeed get people thinking and politicians worrying.<br /><br />A FICTIONALIZED INTERPRETATION OF THE FACTS - -<br /><br />Of course, it is a shame that everything in the book is not pure fact. Watching this film, one becomes certain that Clay Shaw, played by Tommy Lee Jones in an Oscar-winning role, was certainly guilty as sin. After all, we all but saw him commit the crime. Jim Garrison played deftly by Kevin Costner proves every point including Clay Shaw's perjury as we see the answers to the questions Garrison is asking in flashback form which is followed by Shaw telling yet another lie. The same style is used with John Candy's character Dean Andrews answering the question, "Did you ever met Clay Shaw?", with, "I never met the dude", while he asks for more cashews from Shaw in a simultaneous flashback. Oliver Stone uses this flashback device as a sort of lie detector for the viewers' benefit and entertainment throughout the film to reinforce his point. The benefit is the immediate comprehension of the point that Stone wants to make, but the entertainment value is the more lasting one. In essence, watching these scenes over and over is just as comedic each time but as one gets familiar with the facts [as they are being presented], one can both see the flaws in the argument and be drawn to collecting the facts oneself from more objective sources. If only Stone had been a little more objective with his arguments/facts, this film would have been a great gift to humankind instead of just great entertainment for film fans/JFK conspiracy theorists.<br /><br />ABOUT THE 2 DISK DVD SPECIAL EDITION:<br /><br />There are scenes in this DVD that are not on the VHS or theatrical releases. These additions make much of the rapid-fire quasi-facts presented during the Garrison explanations at trial make more sense. Widescreen helps too, as this ensemble cast does not quite fit in full frame in some sequences.<br /><br />FEATURES: THIS DIRECTOR'S CUT 2-DISK SET IS WORTH THE DIFFERENCE!<br /><br />Deleted scenes are usually best left deleted. This film is no exception as they really slow things down, but they do add understanding to the heart of the film's premise. There is also a thought-provoking feature which details what the Congress has done regarding looking into this matter (JFK's assassination) after this film's release.<br /><br />-- * ABRIDGED LIST OF THE CAST -- *<br /><br />Kevin Costner - Jim Garrison<br /><br />Sissy Spacek - Liz Garrison<br /><br />Joe Pesci - David Ferrie<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones - Clay Shaw<br /><br />Gary Oldman - Lee Harvey Oswald<br /><br />Michael Rooker - Bill Broussard<br /><br />Jay O.

However, as a theatrical piece it has no equal in the genre and is thoroughly captivating to see from beginning to end. As to truth, that is something much harder to ascertain. Having said all that, it is definitely worth seeing, and best if watched while paying very close attention.</p></body></html>

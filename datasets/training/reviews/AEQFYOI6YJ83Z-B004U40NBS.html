<meta name="summary" content="A solid, disturbing ode to psychological horror."></head><body><p>Darren Aronofsky's BLACK SWAN isn't an original film.  Its premise--a young woman experiencing a breakdown amid potentially supernatural occurrences--is a staple of the horror genre.  This is, however, Aronofsky's take on such a film, his personal stamp on a certain style (much as he did with the superior film THE WRESTLER and the sports genre in general).<br /><br />BLACK SWAN follows a ballerina's embrace of "Swan Lake."  Nina Sayers has the White Swan role down pat; but she has never really let loose enough to take on the role of the Black Swan.  Thus, her understudy, Lily, comes into the picture.  But the relationship between the two is complicated: part friendship, part rivalry, part sexual attraction, and the tension escalates into a breathtaking finale that is predictable but nevertheless stunning.<br /><br />Natalie Portman easily deserves her Oscar; her performance is on-pitch and captivating.  Mila Kunis, who has never truly overwhelmed in a serious role, is surprisingly adept here; she manages to be seductive, charming, and scary, all in one scene.  Winona Ryder, as the "older" ballerina Portman is replacing, is equally chilling, as is Vincent Cassel as the stereotypical demanding boss (though his performance is anything but cliched).  Barbara Hershey is a surprise delight as Nina's caring-possibly-psychotic mother.<br /><br />The script is a little flat, which is intentional; this film is as much an homage as it is a stand-alone piece.  Aronofsky isn't aiming for the skies, and that is what makes BLACK SWAN so compelling: it's a small slice of insanity, with some truly disturbing scenes and some fantastic performances.  If it isn't the best expression of Aronofsky's artistic vision, it certainly deserves status as a "personal favorite" among his fans; either way, it is an above-par psychological thriller that deserves most of the praise that has been heaped upon it.</p></body></html>

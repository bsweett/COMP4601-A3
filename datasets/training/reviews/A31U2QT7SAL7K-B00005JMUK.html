<meta name="summary" content="Stunning performances from both Theron and Ricci!"></head><body><p>There's little that can be added to this forum regarding the Oscar-winning "Monsters".  Theron is unbelievably both grotesquely repulsive yet appealing as Aileen Wuornos, a woman that a "monstrous" society shaped.  Ricci, as always, is in fine form as Wuornos' companion.  After appearing frequently in films of late, it's refreshing to see Bruce Dern as Aileen's supportive friend.<br /><br />As I watched the film, I found myself in awe of the lengths that Miss Theron took in tackling this role, turning her strikingly beautiful good looks into something unrecognizable yet totally captivating.<br /><br />The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences got this one dead on the mark when it awarded the actress with its coveted "Best Actress" Oscar.<br /><br />It would've been a greater honor if director Jenkins had won, too!</p></body></html>

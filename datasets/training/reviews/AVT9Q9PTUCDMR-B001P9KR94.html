<meta name="summary" content="great movie; poor DVD package"></head><body><p>The movie is fantastic but don't waste any $ on this DVD release. It looks like one of those put out quickly to cash in on the Oscar buzz. There are zero extras on this. That's right--no commentary tracks, no deleted scenes, no making of's, etc.<br /><br />Come on! There is a huge goldmine of stuff they could have done as to how this movie even got made, a look at the actors who we know little of and a look at Mumbai itself.<br /><br />Shameful release really that shows almost no understanding of the DVD market.</p></body></html>

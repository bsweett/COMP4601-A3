Accidentally they become witnesses to the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago and take a job in an all-girl band to get out of town for a couple of weeks. En route they meet up with Marilyn Monroe. Tony Curtis cons Marilyn into believing he's a rich yacht owner, while Jack Lemmon becomes engaged to a real yacht owner. Eventually everything gets sorted out, the Mob wipes out the St. Valentine's Day perpetrator, and Curtis, Lemmon, Monroe, and the rest of the band escape.</p></body></html>

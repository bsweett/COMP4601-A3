<meta name="summary" content="Stronger family values than you might expect in a strangely delightful film"></head><body><p>I really don't want to talk about the plot of this movie, because it isn't all that complicated and watching it unfold is part of the movie's charm.  And, even more, I don't want to talk about the characters in this movie in much detail, although I am sure many others have.  I don't want to discuss the characters in detail because getting to know them individually and as one motley family is really the point of the whole exercise.<br /><br />The film has a terrific cast and each plays his or her role superbly.  Each makes a terrific contribution to the film, and given the special aspects of some of the characters, that is more of an achievement than you might at first expect.<br /><br />But how can I review this movie?  I think I describe what I took away from it (although you might take away very different things) and maybe offer you some suggestions of what to watch for as the story unfolds as you view the movie.  While the story is simple, it is exceedingly strange.  It might even disturb some to the point of turning it off.  Things are said that more crude than I remember ever being said in my family.  However, there are cruel things that are said in deep hurt that do ring true in their depth of pain if not in their specifics.<br /><br />What finally came from my exasperation with these characters is that they don't realize how much their own focus on what they need from outside of themselves to be happy is keeping them unhappy and keeps tripping them up.  Notice the difference in their individual happiness and joy as an extended family as they set aside these conditions and accept life for what it is offering at that moment.  One of them knows that all the way through the movie.  Notice her role in saving them even when they think it is the other way around.<br /><br />For those of you who avoid "R" rated movies, this has that rating because one member of the family stupidly uses drugs, there are some F-bombs and other profanities (but it doesn't swim in them), and there is a side issue with some porn magazines.  No, this isn't a movie to watch with young kids.  However, it ends up with some fairly strong values even in some very strange contexts.  It is also a group of characters and a van you will never ever forget.</p></body></html>

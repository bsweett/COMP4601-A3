As an aspiring climatologist, I was especially glad to see that behind every minor weather problem there was some truth behind it, not necessarily behind the major climate change however.  The story though is more than just about the weather.  In fact it is really just a good tie-in for a father-son relationship in need of healing, or is that vice versa, plus a few other relationships made along the way.  Either way, the special effects were great, not obviously fake, and the relationships that were formed or deepened, although sped up for movie time, were still powerful and as awing as the storm.  This is not just another epic disaster film, and it should not be treated as one.  I found The Day After Tomorrow to be a great and amusing film, and definitely one to kick off the summer blockbuster season.</p></body></html>

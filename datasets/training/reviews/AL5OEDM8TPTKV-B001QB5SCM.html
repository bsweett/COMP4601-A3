<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly Real and Honest"></head><body><p>Two sisters, Rose and Maggie, at opposite ends of the spectrum, and life. Rose, high pressure wallflower attorney spends her life caring for beautiful, aimless Maggie, harboring a hidden secret of her own. At first, it harbors the appearance of "chick flick", especially when you find out Shirley MacClaine stars as an aging grandmother who lives in a Florida retirement community. But what Curtis Hanson has crafted is a smart, sharp drama that is compelling, emotional, and wonderful.<br /><br />It could have very easily slipped into becoming a Lifetime movie of the week, but Hanson's expert direction, and the excellent performances, allow this movie room to breathe and grow into a fine ensemble piece. Each performance is nuanced and balanced. The always strong Toni Collette pulls off her role as Rose with rage and understanable heartbreak. Cameron Diaz turns in another surprising turn as Maggie, proving she's more than just a pretty face. The two are magic together. Shirley MacClaine's Ella is understated and brilliant, making her all the more believable.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie, and I think you would too.</p></body></html>

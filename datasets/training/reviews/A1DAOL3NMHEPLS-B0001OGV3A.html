<meta name="summary" content="The Most Over-Rated Movie of Recent Times?"></head><body><p>Spectacular production; trite story line; laughably bad dialog. In many places, this cartoon-like movie comes across like an old time "tie 'em to the railroad tracks" melodrama. The fight scenes are breathtakingly choreographed, but about as realistic as those in "Buffy, The Vampire Slayer". It's fun, in a goofy sort of way, but not the "great" movie that many people have credited it with being. A solid three stars, but no more.</p></body></html>

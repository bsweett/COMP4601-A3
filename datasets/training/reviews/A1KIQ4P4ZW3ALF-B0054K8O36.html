<meta name="summary" content="Depp in a Rut in a Tiresome Performance"></head><body><p>First, and most importantly, Depp has gotten into a rut, whereas his previous performances in the Pirates series had a novel, wacky, spontaneous nature to them this performance seemed too rehearsed, too practiced. It lacked imagination, energy and fantasy. One example, was his hanging on to a banner and running/riding on horse drawn carts and platforms. Besides being an old and tired routine it seemded added just to inject some energy into what was a pretty tiresome movie. Other than her physical appearance Cruz added little to the movie.<br /><br />Second, part of that can be attributed to the script which lacked imagination and the dark, foreboding comedy and fantasy we've come to expect. The Cruz as daughter, the mermaids and the fountain-of-youth subplots seemed to be something borrowed as a shortcut through a lack of creative effort; to show us something truly fantastical. The mermaid graphics besides being cheap looking seemed more appropriate for showcasing a Victoria's Secret modeling exhibition. The sword fighting scenes looked like a high school stage revue. And, of course, the same old tavern look. Thus the hackneyed flow to the story. But of course this is a Disney movie so there's no secret to where the monied priorities lie.<br /><br />A very forgettable continuation of the series. That is often the case when the sequels continue primarily because they've become an easily reworked cash cow.</p></body></html>

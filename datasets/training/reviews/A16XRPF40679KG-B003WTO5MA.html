<meta name="summary" content="worst A movie remake in many a year"></head><body><p>Lots of horror movies are b or c or even d movies so I give them breaks on their badness and even give them there own star system. After all I can't compare a low budget horror flick to any A movies. This being a A movie is a example of how to remake another great horror classic and just do everything wrong.  The dog scene was added for shock value and the poor man who actually lived this story the late 'george lutz' was deeply hurt by it. He never killed his dog and that's just one of many ways the movie tries to be hip and modern and shallow. It's poorly done for a A movie , it can't even tell a straight story,  so it has no excuse for the shlockfest it is. Avoid this movie and watch the original which has great acting and class. Wether you believe the haunting actually happened; the story is a great ghost story , perhaps the 20th centuries greatest and the first movie did it justice this one is almost as bad as the 'wicker man'remake or the even worse 'black x-mas' which was a terrible A movie disaster remake of a good b movie 'black christmas'. Anyways at least I saw this on blu ray which had great color and looks far better than the standard dvd but that's all it has going for it.</p></body></html>

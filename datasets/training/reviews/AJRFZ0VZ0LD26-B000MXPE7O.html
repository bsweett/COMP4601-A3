I have not seen a character like this since John Le Carre's agent Smiley.  Edward is a quiet man, who keeps his emotions and feelings to himself. He is also damaged, since as a child, he witnessed his father's suicide.  The emotional void of having a father figure in his life, pushes him towards seemingly caring man such as his mentor at the university and eventually towards career in CIA.  Edward is pushed into a marriage to a woman (played by Angelina Jolie) he barely knows and the marriage is doomed from the start.  Their son, the bond that keeps the marriage together is also a reminder to both of them of their poor match.  As we trace Edward's career thru some of the important events of the cold war, we learn about him as a father, husband, lover and the unscrupulous secret agent.  It is difficult to imagine that sensitive young man, interested in poetry and above all loyal to the people close to him would resort to the dread of a life of a spymaster full of secrets and lies.  But then, as the film reaches its conclusion we almost get to think of him as a an on the suicide mission of his own.  He is not looking into pulling the trigger on himself, but he is walking on the tight rope, close to falling at any time.  Then again, he is so worn out and alone, that after al, he has very little to lose in this game.  Directed by Robert DeNiro with wonderful cast of actors.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This Film's Way Better Than "Pearl Harbor""></head><body><p>(If you don't know why I signaled out this movie for the title of my review, watch this film and listen to one of the songs & you will see why).<br /><br />"Team America: World Police" is the brainchild of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of "South Park". Right from the first scene, Stone and Parker's touch is extremely evident: this film is offensive, vulgar and disgusting, but at the same time, it's so repulsively funny. Granted, I've never seen an episode of "South Park", but if it's anything like this movie, I think I'll enjoy it.<br /><br />"Team America: World Police" tells the story of a special police force that is bent on protecting America, even if it means destroying the Eifel Tower. (And did I mention all the characters are puppets?). When their M - like boss Spotswood learns of an attack put together bu various terrorist organizations,, he recruits Broadway star Gary Johnston to help the team by going the fictional Middle Eastern city Durka Durkastan and infiltrating the terrorists and saving the world,. The plan works flawlessly (and hilariously), or so it seems. Gary and his teammate Lisa fall deeply in love with each other, culmianting int he much publicized sex scene (which is longer thanks to the unrated version). They soon learn that the attack is far from over, and has been planned by North Korean dictator Kimg Jong Ill (who is hilariously). There are some very funny moments included in this film, including:<br /><br />-A two minute vomiting sequence that  is truly gross but extremely hilarious.<br /><br />-A retarted Matt Damon (one of the many liberal celebrities that are lampooned in this movie.<br /><br />-The sex scene (like you didn't see that coming).<br /><br />-The scene where Gary needs to prove his trust to Spotswood.<br /><br />Perhaps the funniest aspect of the movie, however, are the songs. These includce the theme song, "Only A Woman", "Freedom Isn't Free", "The Pearl Harbor Sucks Song", "You Are Worhtress Arec Barrwin", Ill's "I'm So Ronery", "Montage" and the uproraious "Rent" sendup (however, I find it a little disturbing that, for the dvd release, they left in the line "the pope has got it and so do you" in the wake of the tragic passing of the pope).<br /><br />My advice is plain and simple: if you enjoy lauhing, you will enjoy "Team America: World Police".</p></body></html>

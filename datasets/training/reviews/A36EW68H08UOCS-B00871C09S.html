<meta name="summary" content="Grace Kelly and Jimmy Stewart are perfect for Hitchcock!"></head><body><p>Jimmy Stewart is L.B. Jeffries, an action photographer who is laid up with his leg in a cast to his waist after getting too close to an automobile racing accident.  From the rear window of his New York apartment &quot;Jeff&quot; can see the going's on of many of his neighbors - &quot;Miss Lonelyhearts&quot;, a middle-aged lady who seems unlucky in love,  &quot;The Songwriter&quot; who plunks at his studio piano trying to come up with a hit, &quot;Miss Torso&quot; the dancer who entertains many men in between stretching her lithe body across the courtyard from our vantage-point.<p>Jeffries also has a girlfriend, a socialite named Lisa Fremont who is played by Grace Kelly, and the Princess never looked more beautiful or graceful than in this film.  Her introduction into the movie is, in my humble opinion, the most beautiful &quot;close-up&quot; ever done, and when she kisses Jimmy Stewart how many men have wished that it were them?<p>OH! Did I mention there is a spine-tingling mystery story mixed in with all of the above?  One of Jeffries neighbors is Lars Thorwald, played by Raymond Burr, who has an invalid wife who nags and belittles him.  One day the wife is gone.  Has she just gone on a visit?  Or has Mr. Thorwald had enough and done her in?  I won't answer that question, but I promise you'll be on the edge of your seat more than once as you find out.  There is more than one scene where the suspense is almost unbearable.<p>Thelma Ritter is in several scenes as the home-health nurse who comes to look in after the immobilized Jeffries, and she steals all of her scenes with her witty and morbid sense of curiosity.<p>The restoration and transfer of the film to DVD looks great, and the extras are informative and probably about as much &quot;extra material&quot; as could be put together here 4 decades after the fact. <p>Hitchcock made dozens of films, and many of them are considered among the very best ever made.  This is one of those.  Only recommended for those who really want to be entertained.</p></body></html>

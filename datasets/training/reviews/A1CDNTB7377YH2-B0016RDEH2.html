<meta name="summary" content="Compelling!"></head><body><p>Very compelling tale of a young girl who is forced with her sickly and ready to conceive mother, to live with her cruel father in the 1930's war torn Spanish countryside.  Her father is El Capitan of a military force seeking out rebels against the government.  He loves to torture and brutally murder anybody he catches, whether they are rebels or not (warning: some of the scenes are so graphic that they are difficult to watch if you have a weak stomach).  The girl's means of blocking out all this cruelty are the fairy tales her mother tells her.  Suddenly those fairy tales seem to come to life as the girl meets a fairy that takes her to see Faun in the area near the house called the Labyrinth (it is like a large maze).  The Faun tells her that she is a princess from another land and the only way for her to open the portal to get back is to perform three brave tasks.  Spoiler below:<br /><br />The story moves to its conclusion reminiscent of the Twilight Zone tale "Next Stop Willoughby," with a little bit borrowed from the movie "A Beautiful Mind."<br /><br />Don't look for super special effects; however, they are not necessary as the story itself is what makes this movie good.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Similar To The Original"></head><body><p>Same format same results.  Yes, its amusing but the story line is so identical to Meet The parents.  Robert Denero's character is so mistrusting of his future son in law.  Hoffman and Striesand are a couple of goofballs.  A little funny but alot silly and full of nonsense.  Ben Stiller seems like the most sensible one in this film.<br /><br />Don't buy all the hype.  This movie is OK but certainly not over the top.</p></body></html>

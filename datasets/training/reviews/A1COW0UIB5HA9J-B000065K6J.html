<meta name="summary" content="Edge of your seat thrill ride and a nice Blu-Ray"></head><body><p>A year later after the events of Alex Brown's deal with death, a young girl ( Ali Larter) has similar psychic powers like Browns's of predicting death before it comes, she joins up with eight survivors whom escaped from a freak accident on a highway. Only she with the survivors must come up with a plan to cheat death  before it's too late for all of them.<br /><br />This sequel to the instant horror hit of 2000 is probably even more better than the original. It's got plenty of shocks and creative death scenes smothered in gore and accident scenes that are very much realistic, literally killer special effects, good acting, a well done storyline and heck, even Tony Todd The Candyman himself from the original Final Destination returns as the mortician whom knows how to conquer death.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray has a good high def transfer but feels the same as the DVD and the sound is terrific. The extras are the same as the all-access pass featuretes with commentary, bits and pieces featurette, deleted scenes/alternate scenes with commentary, trailers and 3 featurettes plus fact track</p></body></html>

I can pretty much handle anything you can throw at me, but the title suggest I am going to see some really disturbing stuff! To my surprise, the movie has nowhere near the gore I thought it would have. This is a good thing and it is really more in the same vein as Se7en and Halloween etc. A good entry in the horror genre and much better than I expected. I liked the third installment, but I was not too impressed with the second one. If you must see a Saw then this is the Saw to see. ;-b</p></body></html>

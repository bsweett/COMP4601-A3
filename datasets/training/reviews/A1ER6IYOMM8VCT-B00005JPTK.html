Unfortunately, it goes seriously awry in the second half. It's hard to believe as you watch this film unravel from near masterpiece to typical Hollywood action fare.<br /><br />The film is interesting and entertaining to a point, it just has a very unsatisfying ending and it could have used some narration. The narration could have helped explain some things going on, like where are the generators for electricity you have in your house and what is that stuff he poured on his steps etc.etc. etc.?! The CGI creatures are not all that convincing, but I could have lived with that had the film followed the original story. This could have been one of the best Sci-Fi films in history, but it's destined to be forgotten. I think the 'The Omega Man' despite it's flaws is a better film and 'The Last Man On Earth' is too, at least those films had some guts!<br /><br />To make matters worse, the two disc edition is terrible! The only extra feature you get is an alternate version of the movie which is only the last few minutes. The alternate ending is not as good as the theatrical one, but strangely enough both versions have some good points and some really bad ones. If this film had followed the book closer it would have been great, as it is, it's not even on par with 'The Omega Man' or 'The Last Man On Earth'!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Realistic gritty look at gangster life!!!"></head><body><p>Al Pacino is not your average everyday actor, shy in interviews & nervous at awards show, especially his acceptance speech in 1993 for his best actor win for "Scent of a Woman", but when he is in character, he is in top form, he totally embodies the character of Tony Montana, a character with a cult following that even Pacino cringes about when asked about its following,although he did say it has been his favorite character to ever play, in this he is Montana, a cuban refugee who comes to America when Castro ousted many refugees in 1980, he is one of the many refugees dropped off in Miami, who is given a green card in exchange for a favor that involves killing one of Castro's ousted leaders, once a citizen, he & his friend & partner(Steven Baur) begin to build a new life, mainly a minimum wage job in a local resturaunt stand, they yearn for the good life & are soon introduced to Omar(F.Murray Abraham) who offers them lots of money for a drug drop which they agree to,only to be double-crossed by the seller who uses a chainsaw to make his point by killing one of his other friends, which soon prompts Baur & another to retaliate in a rescue attempt in which Tony ends up killing the seller in a revenge-style killing, he then takes the money & drugs to the big man, not Omar, the big man is Frank(Robert Loggia)who takes Montana under his wing as a potential successor, here Montana meets Elvira(Michelle Pfrieffer) who Tony developes a fixation on, Tony soon meets with their supplier in South America who soon has Omar assasinated because he is an informant, Tony & Alex(Paul Shenar)the supplier soon click, & Frank in Miami feeling threatened soon has a hit out on Tony, a hit that goes wrong in which Tony retaliates in a neat fashion, once confronted, Frank is soon killed in retaliation as is a corrupt Narcotics Detective(Harris Yulan)who earlier tells Tony he will bust if not paid off,after this Tony soon heads Frank's operation & marries Elvira, & quickly rises to the top of the drug trade, most notably cocaine, but his new found wealth is compromised as he is soon busted by other Narcotic Detectives in which he is facing jail time,via a video camera which his lawyer cannot get him out of, however his supplier Alex agrees to help him out with his influence in Washington & in the Justice System in exchange for a favor that involves Tony assasinating a International U.N.spy who is bound & determined to stop the drug trade, at a summit in NY, Tony agrees but retracts when he learns that the wife & children are involved in the assassination, this begins his downfall as the supplier now with tremendous heat upon him orders a hit on Montana & his whole Empire, & succeeds in a rather intense conclusion in which Tony takes on an army of assassins, & takes out half before being taken out himself, this movie shows the dynamics of the dangerous world of drug lords, where you can have it all & lose it all if you are not careful, one neat scene is when Tony tells patrons at a fancy restuarant that they are the bad people & that they need people like him to scapegoat, as he says "say goodnight to the bad guy" revealing the hypotcritsy of rich people & their attempt to point fingers at his kind,although out of print, Universal is planning a re-release next year in theatres in honor of its 20th Anniversary, as well as a 2-disc set on DVD which is said to be much better than its initial DVD release now out of print, definately a underrated gangster movie that reveals the Miami drug trade & its reality, Tony Montana is definately the Anti-Hero you love to root for, & Pacino gives his best performance of his career here!!! Mary Elizabeth Monstantonio(The Abyss, Color of Money)is also here as Tony's sister who Tony is vey protective of & it too leads to his downfall, although 3 hours long, you never notice the time!!</p></body></html>

It is a pretty decent film that will be well worth renting once it hits DVD, but I would pass seeing this one in theaters. The acting is good for the most part and the $130 million dollar budget was spent on some good special effects and stunts. I don't regret spending $7.00 on this movie, but it is really nothing memorable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Scott's Patton in Hi-Def"></head><body><p>I have just seen this film in the Blu-ray format and it is superb!! A previous reviewer complained about the lack of grain in the film but that's what made the transfer so great!! Also there is a brief introduction by Francis Ford Coppola before the film starts and it is very insightful about his experiences in gathering information for this classic film.  The transfer, as I stated before, is excellent and duplicates the experience of having seen it in the 70mm format (2:20) in the theatre.  Although the film borders very close to 3 hours, this is one of those films that you wish could last a little bit longer (Scott was dissatisfied with the film and refused the Oscar,later did a TV film version of Patton's last days).  So if you're already a fan of this classic, I do recommend getting this in Blu-ray --I will very shortly!!</p></body></html>

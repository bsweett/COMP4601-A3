<meta name="summary" content="Greatest movie of all time?  Hard to argue"></head><body><p>In 1941 actor/director/writer Orson Welles would release one of the most cherished films to ever hit the silver screen.  Many have cited it as the greatest film of all time, and many more agree that Citizen Kane is the quintessential American movie.  Like all great films it transcends traditional narrative to become something all its own.  The movie almost holds a surreal feel as audiences are thrust into the luxurious, yet lonely life of Charles Foster Kane.<br /><br />Citizen Kane is a great looking film, no question about it.  It's obvious that the sets are fake but the movie uses that to its full advantage.  Each of these sets is so exaggerated and ornate that it allows the film to transcend generations.  It's a kind of timeless quality that is rarely seen in contemporary pieces.  What looked good in this film upon its release still looks good to this day because it is an exaggeration of the American culture, which when someone really thinks about it, hasn't changed much since the time of Citizen Kane's release.<br /><br />Even more important to Citizen Kane's set designs are the lighting mixed with expert photography.  Lighting of Kane becomes the most crucial aspect of discerning his character and foreshadowing his path.  Though the dialogue is often brilliant, Citizen Kane seems to have been made with solely the visuals in mind, because it is clear that the story of Kane's rise and fall can be told through the powerful imagery presented throughout the movie.<br /><br />From being the "voice of the people" through the use of his newspaper (The Inquirer) to giving off the ferocious political campaign speeches clearly inspired by Adolf Hitler, the scope of Citizen Kane never seems to back down in its uncompromising character-study of a man who could never back down.  As the viewer follows his path towards self-destruction they realize that this character is not unlike many who still inhabit the country to this very day.  When they look at Orson Welles as Kane they can see the type of person everyone knows all too well.  Everyone knows about someone who will do anything for love, only to discover he's done all the wrong things.  Kane fails in life because he never learns that an emotion such as love can never be bought.  Gratitude can be bought, or appreciation, but love requires something beyond the material realm of personal interaction.  All these emotional issues are brought to focus by the film's outstanding scope, which is far ahead of its time.<br /><br />What else stands out about this film?  Everyone cites the lighting, directing, and sets, but also one needs to keep in mind: Orson Welles' acting is extraordinary.  He can be funny, tragic, compelling, charismatic, and many scenes he is in make-up in order to play Kane through the decades.  Surely it is one of the greatest performances ever captured on the silver screen.<br /><br />So, is Citizen Kane the "greatest movie ever made"?  Without much hesitation the answer is yes.  Maybe it isn't at times the most entertaining film ever made, but it clearly has the merits that make it worth seeing again and again.  This film looks great, its story is full of loose-ends for the audience to solve for themselves, but most important of all is how well the film has aged.  There are not many, if any complaints to be had in regards to Orson Welles cinematic landmark.<br /><br />Citizen Kane remains the undisputed champion of American cinema...<br /><br />But how is the DVD?  Well, in short: the two-disc special edition is a great restoration of this film and includes a great deal of special features.  The best of these features is a feature length commentary by infamous film critic Roger Ebert and the other being the documentary "The Battle for Citizen Kane" which is a great overview of the conflict between Orson Welles and communications tycoon William Hearst.<br /><br />If you truly love movies you'd be a fool not to have this landmark film as a part of your collection.</p></body></html>

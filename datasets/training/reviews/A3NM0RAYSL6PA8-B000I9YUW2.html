<meta name="summary" content="A promising beginning -- then pap."></head><body><p>The Forgotten rings true to its name, with a stunningly lame and forgettable ending that makes your regret having invested even a small amount of time giving it a chance.  What begins as a strange and reasonably provocative melodrama of a woman who remembers a child that everyone else believes is a figment of her deranged imagination turns into "Plan 9 From Outer Space" silliness about a emotionally immature group of emotionally maladjusted aliens who engage in silly experments on a group of generally mediocre actors.<br /><br />Save your self the money and the time.</p></body></html>

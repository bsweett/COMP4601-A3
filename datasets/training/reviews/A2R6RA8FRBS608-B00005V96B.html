There's action, adventure, scenes that evoke genuine emotion and lots of good one-liners and even a few "sight gags," too. The actors doing the voiceovers were chosen with care and the flow of the movie is very good--the plot unfolds smoothly without becoming too fast or too slow. The script was well written, too. The film even explores the themes of friendship and the universal struggle between good and evil; that's very impressive.<br /><br />When the action starts, we quickly meet two employees of Monsters, Inc., a power plant in the city of Monstropolis which, by the way, is populated only by monsters who scare children. There's James Sullivan aka "Sully" (voiced by John Goodman) and his buddy Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal). Sullivan is number one at scaring children; but his not-so-friendly coworker Randall Boggs (voiced by Steve Buscemi) is a competitor for the number one slot. Other monsters working at Monsters, Inc. include the boss of it all, Henry Waternoose (voiced by James Coburn); Celia the receptionist (voiced by Jennifer Tilly) and Roz (voiced by Bob Peterson), a cranky older monster who's a stickler for paperwork! Roz is not too happy with Mike because he never seems to file his paperwork correctly--or even on time!<br /><br />At Monsters, Inc., monsters generate power similar to electricity by entering children's bedrooms in the human world at night through closet doors to make the kids scream in horror! Unfortunately, however, Monstropolis has a problem; the monsters are just not producing enough power from the children's screams. Another interesting thing is that the kids don't know that the monsters are actually quite afraid--of them! The monsters believe that human children are extremely frightening--and the kids could easily be toxic, too!<br /><br />A big problem eventually arises when James accidentally lets a two year old child into the world of Monstropolis. The state police-like Child Detection Agents need to capture the child and send it back to its home before the child might infect, harm or even kill a monster! James and Mike go through many trials and tribulations just to keep track of the playful and often hard to catch child; and we get quite a few unexpected plot twists and turns before the movie ends!<br /><br />The two DVD version of this film offers us a plethora of extra features which are truly wonderful. On the first disc, there is the choice between viewing the film in widescreen or fullscreen, although you can only get the audio commentary and the 5.1 surround sound effects mix when you watch this in widescreen format. On the second disc, most of the extras are divided into one of two categories: "Humans Only" and "Monsters Only." With "Humans Only" you get a tour of Pixar Studios (at least as it was when this was first released); deleted scenes; a "Monstropolis Art Gallery;" another featurette entitled "Animation Gags and Guide To `In' Jokes"--and more! With "Monsters Only" you get a training video for your first day at Monsters, Inc.; "See The Monsters, Inc. Employee Handbook;" "Learn The History of The Monster World"--and still more! In a general category you also get "Mike's New Car," "Outtakes" and "For the Birds."<br /><br />Monsters, Inc. is a wonderfully animated family film that is sure to remain a favorite for many years to come. Although there are a few potentially scary scenes near the end of the film, I still highly recommend this film for family entertainment; use your judgment when thinking of showing this to very young children.</p></body></html>

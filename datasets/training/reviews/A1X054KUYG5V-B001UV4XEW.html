<meta name="summary" content="Non-formulaic, consistently-funny comedy"></head><body><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Though I felt that the inclusion of the stereotypical Asian character was rather stupid and not very funny, on the whole The Hangover is a fresh, original comedy that doesn't follow any preordained path in giving the audience a lot of laughs (mainly from Zach Galifianakis, who single-handedly makes this movie) and lends itself to compulsive quoting and rewatching.<br /><br />3/4</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Sick Sense."></head><body><p>In the opening, people start committing suicide randomly, finding strangely violent cinematic ways to dispatch themselves - and they haven't even seen this film yet. Cut to Marky Mark, a high school teacher in Philly who is making his kids fail their SATs by filling their heads with nonsense about disappearing bees. Are the bees related? What do you think? When the news of this potential bio-terrorist attack hits the school, Mark decides for some reason to get on a train with his not-quite-clear-how-estanged wife. More deaths follow, the train stops en route.<br /><br />A bunch of third-tier characters kill themselves in imaginatively gruesome ways and Mark uses his science teaching skills to figure out the virus is highly communicable and travels through the air. Genius. A botanist whom he happens across tells him: it's the plants - they've had enough of our non-recycling polluting ways and oak trees are throwing the kill switch on humans. And he believes that. So what better way to escape than with a bunch of strangers spending the next 20 minutes of screen time walking across a field? More people die, surprisingly enough, and their group gets ever-smaller. Wahlberg's performance here spawned a series of sketches in SNL where he talks to chickens and road signs, it's just that good.<br /><br />Finally they reach the house of a crazy old hermit woman who harasses the hell out of them, forcing some high school-level acting from almost everyone in the same scene. She dies too. In a relationship moment, Mark's wife tells him about some tiramisu she ate with another guy and wonders if that's cheating. The next day, they leave the house and mysteriously the virus has completely gone, just like the $10 from my wallet and *just like a scientist on a TV report at the beginning said it would*. They live.<br /><br />In the epilogue set in Paris (the first time M has stepped outside of Philly for a long time), stereotypical French people are walking next to the Eiffel Tower, carrying baguettes and garlic and probably smoking too. They start to kill themselves, just like in the film's opening in Central Park. The wind is heard through the trees as The Happening continues. This summary just saved you two hours. You're welcome.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Certainly inspirational, but possibly a little too focused on money?"></head><body><p>Okay, I may be a teacher for the public education system, but I admittedly have never had to live on the streets.  That probably lends some bias to this story as I have never truly desired money as much as the characters here.  I do not mock or disregard poverty at all, but it's kind of weird to market a movie based on the struggle for wealth to middle- and upper-class citizens when they are already doing reasonable all right.  I guess it's an off sense of morality on my part, but in my case it's weird to see so much focus on material gain.<br /><br />Even so, this is certainly an admirable story that I feel made a more-than-decent movie that brings a tear and a heart ache to me to watch the suffering of a father and son--both excellent people.  I found myself cheering as this common man was able to go against all odds to achieve on Wall Street.<br /><br />This is a role that is somewhat different from others Will Smith has done, but he and his son did an excellent job.  Smith has that character sass and determination that I feel made him perfect for the part.<br /><br />The true story I feel is even more inspirational. Don't get me wrong, this is a great movie and worthy of its praise.  It's just almost patronizing in its way.</p></body></html>

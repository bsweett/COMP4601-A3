<meta name="summary" content="DeNiro And Dakota Save The World"></head><body><p>Not since "Godsend" has a movie had four alternate endings, not to mention both starring the nearly unflappable Robert DeNiro.  Enormously talented child-star Dakota Fanning also stars in this bemusing thriller.  She looks a lot more serious, but no less watch-able as she portrays psychologist DeNiro's dark haired, depressed daughter.  Seems Mommy killed herself, so Daddy decides to move to Upstate New York to get away from it all and purchases a huge house that harbors a mysterious new "friend" of his daughter she calls "Charlie".  Soon, the bathroom contains lots of gruesome wall notes and Dakota is drawing scary pictures of people dying.  Then there are those darn unexplainable deaths that happen.  Who is the murderer?  Is it "Charlie" or the weird neighbor who just lost his own daughter?  Is it the odd local policeman or one of DeNiro's pleasant girlfriends?  The film is well shot and the acting is superb.  The ending did surprise me and was clever, although I should have seen it coming a long time before.  This makes for fun entertainment with plenty of extras to see how difficult screenwriting can actually be.</p></body></html>

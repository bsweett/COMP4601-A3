<meta name="summary" content="Get It While It's Hot"></head><body><p>We straggled through Saturday's blizzard in a Long Island movieplex to find ourselves the only ones in the audience, proving our dedication to action films.  As others have noted, the film is all about snow, so the mood was oddly muted.<br /><br />I never saw the original, but this version was terrific, well acted by Ethan Hawke, Maria Bello and others--even Ja Rule was refreshingly good as "Smiley," always talking about himself in the third person (i.e., "Smiley doesn't like that!")<br /><br />The fellow who plays the current Lieutenant on NYPD BLUE shows up in this film too, he's even more repellent here, but shows a side of himself that I liked.  I found the film well structured, tense, satisfyingly stylish.  OK, so the bad guys' plot was a little overdetermined--you wouldn't think they'd be able to muster up dozens of co-conspirators at apparently a day's notice.<br /><br />Drea Di Matteo was just the same as she is in The Sopranos, except she was lit and made up horribly, she looks like death and should sue the director.  She plays a secretary, "Iris," who likes to have sex with "bad boys," and this bizarre conception just makes you feel sorry for the actress.  Lawrence Fishburne plays her opposite number, and nowadays he's on the chubby side, looks like he's bursting out of his tight sleekly cut suits.  Who ate all the pies, Lawrence Fishburne?<br /><br />Maria Bello has a truly good part for once as the psychiatrist with a romantic interest in Jake (the weary cop played by Ethan Hawke).  I won't reveal what happens, but when she utters the line, "A hundred" (and those of you who have seen the film will know the part I'm talking about), you really feel for her, she shows remarkable bravery and an impressive heroism.  She's one you'd like on your side.<br /><br />We were screaming and cheering all the way through it.  Try to get to see this while it's still in a big theater, you'll have a ball.</p></body></html>

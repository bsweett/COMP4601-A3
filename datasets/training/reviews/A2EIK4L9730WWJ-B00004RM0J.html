When this one came out in 1985 it was a hit and it has everything from action to some romance to some great chases!!!! When a bunch of kids go exploring they come across a treasure pirate ship with treasures that will make the kids rich,but a mob wants the treasure too!!!!! Its a battle between the kids and the mob for this treasure!!!!!! Like i said before this family movie is great for a wonderful night with everyone and its also great to watch over again and again!!!!!</p></body></html>

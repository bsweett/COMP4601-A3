<meta name="summary" content="Lesser Shyamalen in some ways, but nonetheless interesting"></head><body><p>I guess I can see why many film enthusiasts don't like "The Happening" very much.  After the rich visuals and truly "out there" stories of "Unbreakable", "Signs", and, of course "The Sixth Sense", this one feels a little stark and one-note, both thematically and visually.  In the former category, this is simply a story of nature rebelling against man.  Yes, there's some mystery (how far exactly will nature go?), but basically it's a movie about characters running through fields trying to escape toxin-laden winds.  On the latter front, the visuals offer no moody shadows, no scary night scenes, nothing but bright sunlight.  That's a brave and certainly credible choice in some ways (Stanley Kubrick, for example, deliberately filmed "The Shining" as a brightly lit movie to avoid the visual cliches of most onscreen horror), but unless other aspects of your story are rich and complex, sunshine and bright lighting probably aren't the most interesting ways to go in the suspense/horror genre.<br /><br />But having said all that, the movie is still sufficiently creepy and scary, and we care enough about the characters (especially the neurotic but endearing couple played by Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel) to stay emotionally invested in the proceedings.  It's also interesting to see Mr. Shyamalan offer up a hard R-rated film, though one can argue that his previous PG-13 limitations forced him to shock us more creatively and subtly.<br /><br />In the end, if you like movies like "The Birds", "The Mist", the thousand or so entries in the "zombies vs. mankind" genre, or any number of other movies about a sudden scary phenomenon confronting humanity, with people having to pool together to address the crisis or just survive, you'll probably find "The Happening" compelling and entertaining enough. By my own rankings, it isn't nearly as "must see" as the Shyamalan movies mentioned at the outset, but a little more satisfying than the director's more recent efforts like "The Village" and "Lady in the Water" (though those have their merits, too).  It's a pretty good horror movie, no more and no less.<br /><br />Oh, yes-- it also helps that, at pretty much exactly 90 minutes, "The Happening" doesn't overstay its welcome.  One can't accuse Mr. Shyamalan of believing his story is so important that it needs lots of time to fully tell.  He gets you in and out quick.<br /><br />The standard DVD of "The Happening" features breathtaking picture and sound (it's amazing how good standard DVDs look when real effort goes into their making), and a nice selection of extra features that take you behind the scenes of the movie.</p></body></html>

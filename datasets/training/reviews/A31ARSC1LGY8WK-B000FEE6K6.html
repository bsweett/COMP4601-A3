<meta name="summary" content="An excellent expozay of international arms dealing"></head><body><p>"Lord of War" is a companion to other recent fictional satires on the amorality of big business "Fast Food Nation" and "Thank You for Smoking".<br /><br />Nicholas Cage plays an international arms dealer Yuri Orlov who turns a blind eye to the evil consequences of what he trades in. Cage gives one of this typical sleepy/goofy performances and manages to make a potentially unlikable character somewhat sympathetic.<br /><br />The acting and the look of the film are excellent. The filmmakers have managed to go a long way on a modest budget with South Africa doubling for Liberia, Sierra Leone, and other parts of the world.<br /><br />"Lord of War" is an excellent, thought-provoking expozay of international arms dealing and should be commended for raising the visibility of this important issue.</p></body></html>

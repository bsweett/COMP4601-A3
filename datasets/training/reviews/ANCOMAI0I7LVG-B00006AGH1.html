<meta name="summary" content="A half-cooked bore..."></head><body><p>The problem I have with this film is that it isn't thorough enough to really make an impact, and so it wastes some charisma and top-notch special effects on a plot that feels underdeveloped and tiring.  It bounds with clich&eacute;s and doesn't deliver anything truly noteworthy, and so it becomes stagnant and forgettable.  Ben Affleck has charm, sure, and he can act (to a degree) but both Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin handled this character far better than Affleck, who appeared in most scenes to be out of his comfort zone.  I hear from devoted fans of the book (I've never read it) that the film is a huge disappointment in that it doesn't stay true and shifts many plot points to come across more conservative in lue of the time the film was made (so close to the 9/11 attacks).  I can semi-understand the reasoning there, but in the long run it feels like a copout.  That said, I'm not sure those details really would have saved the film from being a total bore.  Honestly, there is just nothing noteworthy here.  I fell asleep the first few times I tried to watch this.</p></body></html>

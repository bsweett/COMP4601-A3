<meta name="summary" content="Sean Connery IS the only agent 007"></head><body><p>Out of all the 007 movies made and all the actors who have played Agent 007, we only end up with ONE real James Bond and that is Sean Connery.With that said to me there is only ONE James Bond movie that has always had my vote and that is "Gold Finger."  It's the most romantic of all James Bond films, the most well acted of all James Bond films and has the BEST music score of all James Bond films.This movie does everything right. Each scene is more trilling then the next, the bitter/sweet romance between Pussy Galore and Bond is the most sexy of all the 007 movies and Sean Connery proves that HE is the best James Bond of them all.  No other James Bond movie has had the impact that this one great story does and out of all his movies is the most believable.  This is for me "the classic" 007 movie next to "From Russia with Love" and "Doctor No."  After "Gold Finger" they were entertaining but started to get somewhat unbelievable and lost my interest really fast.It was just to bad that this film wasn't originally filmed in Magnetic Stereo Sound so that the DVD would be in 5.1.  Could you imagine hearing that music being played on a THX sound system in full stereo sound.  Never-the-less i still give this movie my thumbs-up and my highest and only James Bond review.Roger Moore who i respect and love as an actor especially in the role of Michael Stewart in "The Miracle", my very first review and my all time BEST PICTURE will never have the "class" that Sean Connery has in just this one film. I won't even comment about all the other James Bonds that followed.Buy this film,,,,it's WONDERFUL!</p></body></html>

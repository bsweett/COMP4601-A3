<meta name="summary" content="One of the greatest American films of all time"></head><body><p>Relesed in 1975, "One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest" won all five major Academy Awards:best picture, best actor in lead role, best actress in lead role, best director, and best screenplay.<br />An adaption of a 1962 novel by Ken Kesey, and filmed in the setting of the novel: Oregon State Hospital, this movie is not a love story or a romantic plot. Rather, this is a story of man's struggle in every society where dictatorship aborts dreams and dignities.<br />A recidivist criminal, McMurphy, is transferred to a mental insitution instead of prison.As his trick to spend an easier sentence, McMurphy(played by Jack Nicholson) thought he can leave any time he wishes since he's perfectly sane. The cast of the mental patients was perfectly picked to show a submissive group of people that most of them chose this life and chose being in this asylum.<br />I once read about a scientific experiment were researchers divided a large fish tank in half by putting a glass wall in the middle. A barracuda was put on one side of the tank and a mackerel on the other. The hungry barracuda tried to get the mackerel but smacked into the glass barrier. Again and again, the barracuda smacked the glass in its attempt to reach its dinner. Finally, realizing how futile its attempts were, the barracuda gave up. Researchers then removed the wall to see what would happen. Surprisingly, the barracuda made no new attempts to reach the mackerel. It eventually starved to death even though food was within easy reach.. The technical term for what happened is "learned helplessness". The barracuda had learned to be helpless from its many failed attempts to reach the other fish. When the barrier was removed, the barracuda continued to operate as if the glass wall was still there.<br />This Learned helplessness is the best term to describe the patients of the asylem depicted in the movie. A group of people that couldn't change any thing in their devestating lives and chose to be in a place were things were pre-chosen for them any way. McMurphy , the charismatic rebel by nature, tried to stand up to the main authority represented by a tyrant called Nurse Ratched played outstandingly by Louise Fletcher. The confrontations between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched started to by funny and silly but developed to be tragically fatal as McMurphy finds out that Ratched don't only have the authority to control the patients physically and mentally, but also the authority to keep him in the insititution for ever and even permanantly disable him.<br />The great acting will keep your heart ingaged while the story of a dream, friendship and the sense of belonging is being born among the guys. High prices are paid to reach a dream, but the dream will live while telling the story of:<br />Wire, briar, limber-lock<br />Three geese in a flock<br />One flew east, one flew west<br />And one flew over the Cuckoo's nest.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Fountain is startlingly beautiful, moving, confusing and intense"></head><body><p>It took a second viewing for me to finally understand and completely fall under the magic spell The Fountain leaves on its audience.  Like most people, I was confused but this film possesses an aspect most cannot comprehend at first (which is why I recommend watching it once or twice again before throwing judgement)--instead of presenting a straightforward plot (beginning, middle, end), The Fountain uses an intellectual, but confusing story focused on two love-entwined people throughout time.  The acting is superb and extremely moving, and the blazing nebula finale is sure to be written down in the books for being one of the most beautiful film creations to date.  The music, composed by Clint Mansell, adds to the magic of The Fountain, especially at the end in which Tommy From The Future finally reaches the rebirthing nebula somewhere far in the galaxy and is reborn with his love Izzy, represented here in the form of a dying tree (I know, it sounds bogus but watch the movie!); this startlingly lovely scene, combined with the music, will bring anyone with a soul to tears.  Sure, The Fountain might not be the favorite for everyone, but as far as fantasy films go it definitely holds its ground.</p></body></html>

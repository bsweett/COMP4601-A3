Tomas Alfredson, in Swedish, subtitled, 2008, 116 minutes. Based on the novel by  John Ajvide Lindqvist) This is a film I was dying to see. Knowing the artful beauty and natural giftedness of Swedish filmmakers/actors, and being a vampire 'buff', I couldn't have lived with myself if I had missed this film. I enjoyed and reviewed the American remake. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BLJQOK">Let Me In</a>, it's good but WHY do we keep messing with Swedish greats?) Let me address one thing in order to avoid confusion: this is a 100% Swedish film - but is often cited as a Norwegian film since it premiered in Norway.<br /><br />With KOMMA, it is plain, especially to those like me who saw the American remake first, that it is a nearly scene-by-scene, line-by-line remake. However, there are major departures, and KOMMA is the more artful, frightening and old-school of the two films. I guess since the Swedes are not known for their vampire films, and in America there are far too many each year, well ....<br /><br />This may be the classic horror film, but it is genius and I wish America made them this great. Here young Oskar (K?re Hedebrant), a tormented boy who looks like an ethereal ghost due to his beautiful paleness, meets Eli (pronounced "Ellie" and played by Lina Leandersson) the stunning creature who looks a bit like an angry Italian fishwife. I noted that she resembles the traditional American idea of the vampire: attractive, very pale, very dark hair and creepy silver eyes.<br /><br />Because he is small and gentle, Oskar is bullied to the extent that he begins a transformation into a psychopath. This is perhaps the most frightening thing about this film - we are watching a sweet little boy being turned into a future serial killer, without a doubt. He fantasizes about violence, follows murders and violent crimes in the tabloids and scrapbooks like Martha Stewart - but only the most violent crimes.<br /><br />He befriends Eli and they fall in love. The scenes of Eli's vampirism are much more eerie, more impactful, than I ever expected. Excellent. In this film, you will see a unique transformation that truly shows what the poor girl is suffering. I will not spoil it, it is simply too good. It far outstrips the silly "Exorcist" job they did in the American remake. Why oh why do we unnecessarily remake these classics??<br /><br />Another point I love about Eli is we discover she can fly. This was completely unclear from the remake, and I can't help the constant comparisons because there is no comparison. KOMMA is 100% better than the remake, in spite of the remake virtually copying KOMMA. The colors blend with the action and have meaning; the soundtrack, while more traditional, is more powerful; the approach is so logical there were moments when I felt this was a VULCAN vampire film.<br /><br />The children here do not seem to shoulder the acting burden placed on the American kids in the remake. That is vital, because the director accomplished so much by doing what looks like so little. The kids approached their roles with a minimalism that adds to the horror, and adds to this film's genius. When Eli, who deeply regrets what she is, chides Oskar for being a psychopath because he chooses to be, I dare you not to shudder.<br /><br />It's filmmaking at genius-level, no question. Though I saw tremendous errors, goofs, not really bloopers, I ask you: doesn't it seem at some point that the director is paying homage? Otherwise it's tough to justify all those errors. In one scene I thought I saw Eli wearing clothing that she won't get until much later in the film!<br /><br />This is a film you cannot afford to ignore, and should own. I suppose the remake is enjoyable in its own way, but I cannot emphasize enough how irritating it is to see a remake so soon and so inferior.<br /><br />Get KOMMA and remember how to be warm again - warm with the glow that only excellent horror film can kindle.</p></body></html>

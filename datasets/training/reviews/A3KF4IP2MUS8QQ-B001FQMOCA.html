Johnny Cash was the man - then, now, and forever.  Heck, the one and only album my parents and I both own is Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison.  I didn't really want to learn anything that might damage my opinion of the man.  Complicating matters, you always have to wonder how much of what you are seeing is accurate and how much is the product of embellishment added to make the story more compelling.  Obviously, I already knew Johnny Cash was no angel in his younger days, but I think Walk the Line does succeed in presenting some of his mistakes and problems in a respectful, realistic way.<br /><br />As good as the movie is, it does have some weaknesses.  Naturally, it can't cover Johnny's whole life in detail (nor does it try to), but some aspects of the story could have used more depth and character exploration.  I remember hearing that some relatives of Johnny's first wife weren't all that thrilled with her characterization in the film.  Frankly, I found it hard to judge her at all because we never really learn much about her.  One minute, we see Johnny calling her from overseas, then the next they're married, and then Johnny finally hits it big and goes out on the road.  His wife comes across as a rather shrewish sort, and that's unfortunate because she should be a more sympathetic character in this context.  As far as Johnny and June Carter go, I would like to have seen their relationship ironed out a little bit more, as well.  From the things we see Johnny do in this film, it's difficult for me to understand why June kept coming back to him - as a singer or as a friend.  Even as their relationship grew into love, I never really saw any kind of special spark in their eyes for one another.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix does a fairly good job in the title role, but I was never able to look at him and see Johnny Cash the way I could look at Jamie Foxx in Ray and see Ray Charles.  The man in black was one-of-a-kind, especially in terms of his voice, and I think Phoenix just tried too hard at times to become the man behind the music.  He especially over-emphasizes Cash's mannerisms onstage, and that just kept disconnecting me from the film.  Casting Reese Witherspoon as June Carter ended up being the Hollywood coup of the year, as she does turn in a wonderful performance, but somebody was asleep at the wheel when some of the other cast members were selected.  Personally, I think terrible mistakes were made in the casting of actors to play Elvis, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis, and some other well-known musicians.  Orbison ended up looking like some chess club geek, while Jerry Lee Lewis looked like he should have been hanging wallpaper somewhere, far away from any stage.  It's like they cast some of these parts by pulling random names out of a hat or something.<br /><br />Despite the questionable casting decisions and some obvious gaps in the chronology of the film, Walk the Line does tell a compelling story about a true icon of the twentieth century.  One of the qualities that made Johnny Cash unique was his humanity.  No matter how big he got, he always seemed to be one of us, a regular guy who made mistakes just like we all do.  That's why the Folsom Prison album seems to stand at the very nexus of Cash's career - even hardened criminals felt like Johnny was one of them.  If he could turn his life around after hitting rock bottom, so could any of them - or us.  I think this inspirational message could have been communicated a little more effectively in the movie, but it certainly makes the story worth telling.  Johnny Cash fan or not, Walk the Line is a movie worth watching.</p></body></html>

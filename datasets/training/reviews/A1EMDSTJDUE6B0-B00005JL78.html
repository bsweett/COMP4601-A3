<meta name="summary" content="Spielberg's Still Got It"></head><body><p>Just a year ago or so, I was wondering if Spielberg could still direct. He had been producer of so many films, some of which he had hardly anything to do with, that I wondered if he still had it. This movie shows that he does. Some imperfections and a little long, but generally a very good show. Some of the ideas and effects seem derived from &quot;The Matrix&quot;, but in a good way and not too obvious. A good cross between action, drama and suspense and worth viewing.</p></body></html>

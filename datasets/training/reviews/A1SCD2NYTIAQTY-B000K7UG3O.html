<meta name="summary" content="Predictably Entertaining"></head><body><p>For starters, this is certainly not my usual choice in visual entertainment, as I am definitely not in touch with my so-called "feminine side".<br /><br />The story line was very predictable, following the formulaic designs of most romantic comedies. First, the problem, (guy won't leave home at 35 years old), followed by the attempted solution, which happens to be the professional "intervener", Paula. Thirdly, feelings develop, but the fourth element of the formula gets in the way, (in this case, the whole deal between Paula and Trip's parents gets blown wide open). This is all concluded in typical Hollywood romance style with what has to be the sappiest Hollywood romance ending I have seen.<br /><br />However, in all this predictable formula, there were some genuine funny parts, such as Trip being victimised by nature, (bitten by vegetarian lizards, attacked by a dolphin and brutally assaulted by a chipmunk, among others). There were also some good witticisms from secondary characters, such as Trips two friends and Paula's flatmate, the mockingbird-hating Kat.<br /><br />All in all, it was an ok movie for the romantic comedy buffs, with some light entertainment thrown in to keep the rest of us happy. Not the best, but it was certainly tolerable to a higher degree than some.</p></body></html>

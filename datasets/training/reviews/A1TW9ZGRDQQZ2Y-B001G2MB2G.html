<meta name="summary" content="For a Harry Potter film, it falls in the middle of the pack"></head><body><p>I thought it was better than The Chamber of Secrets and The Goblet of Fire, but not as good as The Sorcerer's Stone or The Prisoner of Azkaban. I didn't like how a lot of the characters were given nothing to do this time around. Even Ron and Hermoine didn't have as much dialogue. With each film throwing in new characters and the old ones staying around, these movies are getting quite congested. For the first time, the story itself seemed to be just a set up for the last two movies, with no clear resolution.<br /><br />This film is the darkest one yet in the series and they really cut down on the humorous scenes. I did like most of the acting, as well as, the SFX.<br /><br />Not the best in the series by far, but worthy of the Harry Potter name.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great story concept!"></head><body><p>Sometimes the mind has tunnel vision. But details need to be ingrained.<br /><br />"Saw" is a no bones, graphic crime thriller. Knowing that going into view this film can only lead to predictable assumptions. Who is the Killer? That question is always in the viewer's mind. As a side note: Your first instinct is usually right!<br /><br />Director James Wan plays with those viewer's assumptions. "Saw" is about a sadistic serial killer with a conscience on changing his victim's outlook. This is a great story with many twists and options to play with as a scriptwriter. Will you make a drastic decision to save your life?<br /><br />"Saw" starts out with a great premise but ends with the believable factor. How much time would it take to set up these elaborate scenarios with life choice decisions?  The plot is intertwined in massive coincidence of circumstances. The inept detectives (Danny Glover/Ken Leung) round out the mislead manhunt.  Hopefully the sequel will be better. But worth viewing to find out who is the killer!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="great debut for Zach Braff"></head><body><p>Zach Braff wrote, directed and stars in this film about a detached LA actor who returns to New Jersey for his mother's funeral.  Finding he still has problems with his dad, he spends his time visiting his old school friends, partying and exploring a relationship with a new acquaintance played by Natalie Portman.  The soundtrack is excellent; the cast is great, the acting is very good, the story is interesting and Braff shows he has an excellent eye behind the camera.  I would recommend this film.<br /><br />Extras include two commentary tracks, one with Braff and Portman, the other with Braff and his DP, editor and production designer; 16 deleted scenes with optional commentary; a 27-minute making-of featurette; 3 minutes of outtakes; and a soundtrack promo.<br /><br />The film can be heard in English or Spanish with English, Spanish or French subtitles.</p></body></html>

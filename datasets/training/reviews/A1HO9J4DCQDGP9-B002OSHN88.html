<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Post War Films Ever Made"></head><body><p>Arriving in Vienna, author Holly Martins, played superbly by Joseph Cotton learns that an old friend Harry Lime, the deminuative Orson Welles has supposedly been killed in a mysterious car accident. In trying to find out what happened to his friend Martins finds himself drawn into the Post-War world of Vienna. Lime was at the heart of Blackmarket operation in the city and his death is to good too be true in the eyes of the authorities. &quot;The Third Man&quot; has some atonishing camera work for its time, who can forget the alley scenes and the long shadows coupled with a fantastic music score that stays in your head long after the movie is over? This is a stone-cold classic with Cotton and Welles at the helm. Well worth watching just to hear the musical score and watch Harry Lime come out of the shadows...</p></body></html>

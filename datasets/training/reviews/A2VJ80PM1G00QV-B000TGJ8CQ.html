<meta name="summary" content="CREDIBLE FANTASY"></head><body><p>Screenwriters, Director and Nicolas Cage combine to make credible this science fiction action film, and in the process create a fine entertainment. Flash forwards become flashbacks become flash forwards, thanks to the specifications provided by the authors for the ability to see the future. Particularly clever is the gimmick that one can see the future but that the very act of seeing and acting upon what one sees can change that future. Would that Edward G. Robinson, now long ago, would have had that kind of foresight, since what  he saw occurred inevitably, despite his best efforts to avoid it (John Triton 'The Mental Wizard' in Night Has a Thousand Eyes).  Cage underplays wonderfully well, the beautiful girl he loves acts like a beautiful girl with whom he would fall in love, and the FBI team chief (as you know, they are all women now) is suitably tough and impersonal most of the time. There is sufficient action to punctuate and motivate the film but the real star remains human. All-in-all, a fast paced and enjoyable 90+minutes with no deeper significance that what you see on screen. (Note, I do mild violence in describing  Robinson's finemovie in the interests of protecting the pleasure of future viewers)</p></body></html>

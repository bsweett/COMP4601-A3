<meta name="summary" content="Fascinating!"></head><body><p>The story is a young doctor searching for adventure comes to Uganda and accidentally makes a friend of the rulers of the country. Soon he discovers that it is not a game and he is lucky to escape alive although he leaves badly hurt.<br /><br />The story itself I thought needed some work, as I found it hard to believe that a person could be so naive as this doctor pretended to be about what was happening in Uganda during Idi Amin rule. But maybe as I have read true stories of people in Stalin Russia being even more naive then this. I suspect that the film was made for a general viewing as it did not show much of the atrocities that Idi Amin created and what it did show was fairly mild.<br /><br />The acting is reasonable. Forest Whitaker, who played Idi Amin, was extremely good.<br /><br />The filming is good.<br /><br />An interesting movie, I thought.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good Remake Of A Classic"></head><body><p>The original "The Manchurian Candidate" is one of my all-time favorite movies.  The movie has such a great story line, acting and ideas.  So when I heard that Hollywood was remaking a classic, I was very skeptical.  But now after seeing the new version, I am pleasantly surprised of how good of a job Johnathan Demme did with handling a classic.<br /><br />This version takes place after the first Gulf War and I believe that the movie is in 2004.  Captain Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington) is having a re-occuring dream about what one of his fellow soldiers, Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber), did when they platoon had got ambushed during a battle.  Raymond Shaw, who has won a Medal of Honor for his actions in the Gulf War, gets into politics and gets put on a ticket as the Vice-Presidential candidate.  Capt. Marco's dreams becoming more clear to him and another former member of his platoon admits to him about having the same dream.  Capt. Marco comes to the realization that him and his fellow soldiers that were captured were all brain-washed and can still be controlled.  Now Capt. Marco's mission is to convince Raymond Shaw to undergo further testing and to find out who is controlling Raymond and himself.<br /><br />This movie had many good things in it.  Great performances all around by Washington and Meryl Streep.  Streep will probably get an Oscar nomination for this performance.  Maybe Streep and Angela Lansbury will both be winnners of Oscars for playing the same character?  Liev Schreiber does a good job as Raymond Shaw.  Of course, this cast cannot be compared to the original that contained Frank Sinatra, Angela Lansbury and Laurence Harvey.<br /><br />The story line in this movie was obviously updated from the original, but throughout, the main story and even some of the dialogue remained the same from the original.  The only problem that I had with this movie is that it may have been a little too long, but not too long that you lose interest in the movie.  I would highly recommend that you do yourself a favor and see both versions of the movie.</p></body></html>

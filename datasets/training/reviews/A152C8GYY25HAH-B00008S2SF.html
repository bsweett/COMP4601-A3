<meta name="summary" content="Middling Bond adventure"></head><body><p>The James Bond film series has entered its fifth decade, making it by far the longest running franchise in film history. Kids who went to see "Die Another Day" were sitting alongside grandparents who saw the original movies ["Goldfinger", Dr. No", etc.] when they themselves were kids. This newest installment is unlikely to be on many people's list of the best Bond movie ever made. It lies somewhere in the middle. What it may best remembered for is its sometimes ridiculous attempts to align Bond with today's teenagers' cinematic tastes. The car chases, the explosions and the special effects in general tend to overwhelm the witty dialog that has always been one of the movies' trademarks. The result is a film that tries too hard to be all things to all people. It isn't that it isn't fun; it's that it isn't as much fun as many of the earlier efforts. This isn't to say that the franchise is dead. It may well outlive all of us. Any series this long-lived goes through periods when it has to evolve. This has happened to Bond before and will happen to Bond again.<p>The plot of "Die Another Day" concerns the evil son [Toby Stephens] of a North Korean leader. Thanks to the wonder of DNA surgery [whatever that is}, the guy has transformed himself into an evil European who has made a fortune in the diamond trade. He has used his money to launch a satellite that has a powerful laser beam capable of mass destruction. It is up to 007, aided by CIA agent Jinx Jordon [Halle Berry] to stop this madman's plan for world domination. <p>Pierce Brosnan gives his usual competent performance as Bond, and Halle Berry is lovely to look at. Stephens almost steals the show as the bad guy, but Bond movies are famous for their memorable villains. <p>There's not much going on in this movie - no subtext, no hidden meaning. It's pure escapist entertainment. There's nothing to think about. It's a ride you either enjoy or you don't.</p></body></html>

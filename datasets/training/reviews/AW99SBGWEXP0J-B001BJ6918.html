<meta name="summary" content="Kill Bill: Volume 2"></head><body><p>The Bride (Thurnman) is back, and set to continue her revenge streak in Volume 2.  Her targets: Elle (Hannah), Budd (Madsen), and of course, Bill (Carradine).  Along the way, we get flashbacks of her training and the wedding massacre that would set her on her course of revenge.  This is a better movie than Volume 1, focusing more on characters than action.  Volume 2 is also a (marginally) better film than Volume 1.  It can stand on its own, and feels more like a Tarantino film, despite being essentially a love story.  To me, David Carradine was the scene stealer as the titular Bill.  Whereas in Volume 1, he was a mysterious figure, he is probably the most developed character in Volume 2.  Tarantino has made two interesting films that really could have been shortened down into one that might have been better than the sum of its parts.</p></body></html>

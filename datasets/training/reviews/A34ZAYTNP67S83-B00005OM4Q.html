<meta name="summary" content="Absolute perfection"></head><body><p>I originally saw this film in the theatre, and after having bought this particular package, I have to say it's a much better movie with the extra footage.<br /><br />If you watch the both versions back to back, the omissions are glaring in the theatrical cut.  The film would likely have garnered more Oscars than nominations had this footage been in the theatrical release.<br /><br />No matter, for those of us who have a love-hate relationship with the DVD industry, this is one director's cut that justifies the format in every single way.  Oh, did I mention the performances?<br /><br />From top to bottom, everything about this movie is perfect.  From the casting to the editing, from the music selection to the writing, there isn't a weak link in the chain.  Cameron Crowe seemingly goes from strength to strength, and this film represents the pinnacle of his life as a filmmaker.<br /><br />Although I grew up with a big crush on Drew Barrymore, I have to say that Kate Hudson (at least in this role) was MADE for the big screen.  Hopefully she'll get more dramatic parts, but I have a feeling this will be the crowning gem in her career.  She's absolutely luminous, and has you alternately saddened and infatuated at various times throughout the movie.<br /><br />Frances McDormand is also stellar in her supporting role; she gets the biggest laughs.  Just when I thought Crowe wouldn't be able to top "Say Anything", he pulls this one out of thin air.  Stunning.</p></body></html>

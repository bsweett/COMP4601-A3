Written by Ehren Kruger (The Ring, The Brothers Grimm) and directed by Iain Softley (Hackers, K-PAX), the film stars Kate Hudson (Almost Famous, Alex & Emma) and Gena Rowlands (Paulie, The Notebook).  Also appearing is Peter Sarsgaard (K-19: The Widowmaker, Kinsey), Joy Bryant (Get Rich or Die Tryin'), and John Hurt (The Elephant Man, Hellboy, V for Vendetta).<br /><br />Kate Hudson plays Caroline Ellis, a nursing student and hospice worker who, after witnessing the demise of a patient, becomes disillusioned with uncaring, corporate medical machine, quits her job, and looks for a position within a household if only to provide care on a more personal level (this is more or less an outgrowth of some unresolved baggage between her and her father, the latter having passed away not so long ago).  Anyway, she ends up taking a position in a decaying, southern plantation house out in the middle of nowhere, working for an older couple named Ben and Violet Devereaux (Hurt and Rowlands, respectively), as Ben has recently suffered a paralyzing stroke, and can barely move or speak. Upon arriving at the Devereaux estate, Caroline meets the family lawyer Luke Marshall (Sarsgaard), the one who actually hired her, along with Violet, who seems none too receptive of little Miss Thang...anyway, as Caroline moves in and goes about the business of caring for Ben, she begins to notice various peculiarities with regards to the house, the most obvious being there aren't any mirrors and there's a hidden door in the room in the attic, one Violet claims she nor her husband have never opened in their forty plus years in residence in the house (what a crock).  Caroline, not buying what Violet's selling, and being the particularly nosey sort she is, manages to open the mystery door, its contents presenting more questions than answers (kind of like when a contestant on the television show "Let's Make A Deal" picked the door with the `zonk' behind it).  After a bit of prying, Violet eventually relates a bit of history with regards to the house and its violent past.  Soon Caroline suspects the source of Ben's condition to be tied to what she found in the attic, and also that Violet may not be the caring, loving, doting wife she appears to be, eventually leading Caroline into a world of hoodoo rituals and beliefs, one populated by spooky characters and sinister motives, not to mention a whole lot of poultry parts, mystery organs in jars, and brick dust...<br /><br />William Hurt is one lucky crud...his limited role had very few lines, entailing him to lay about with a scared and bewildered look on his mug, and included him sitting in a bathtub and having Kate Hudson rub a warm sponge all over his wrinkly body.  Do you know how many guys would pay to have that done?  More than a few...anyway, as I mentioned earlier, I thought this was a great, little film, one that exceeded my expectations, which, honestly, weren't all that high.  I thought Miss Hudson did well in her role, but there were some aspects about her character I didn't care for, particularly her tendency to walk into peoples homes uninvited (a great way to get yourself shot) and just the fact she was a real snoop, the latter illustrated by her efforts to gain access into that secret room in the attic, which she had no business in whatsoever.  Part of this came from her hearing strange noises emanating from said place, but I'll tell you what, that would have only served to keep me even further away from the room as I've seen enough movies to know curiosity kills more than just cats.  One interesting aspect about this film is I think director Iain Softley must have had a real thing for Hudson (who could blame him), as he sure like filming her form in long, lingering shots.  It's funny, as there's like twenty minutes of deleted scenes included on the DVD, and yet the filmmakers managed to retain, intact, mind you, most all of the long, lingering shots I mentioned earlier.  Well, as I said, I thought Miss Hudson did well, but I thought Gena Rowlands' performance was the real treat here...there just aren't that many actresses out there nowadays that can pull off the creepy old bag routine like there were in the past, at least not to the extent someone like Bette Davis, or Joan Crawford could (when I say `creepy old bag', I mean that in the kindest, possible way), but Rowlands managed to deliver.  She works it well, getting her creep full on about three quarters of the way in, right about the time she and Hudson's character were sitting down one evening for some freshly made gumbo (it was about this time Caroline's suspicions with regards to Violet were confirmed).  She never really went overboard, which I actually appreciated as I think it takes more skill to present restrained psychotic than unfettered crazy.  I thought the cinematography was beautiful, the sense of direction strong, and the pacing of the story maintained well throughout the film (the last twenty minutes or so sweeps you up like a strong river current).  One aspect I really liked was how we were presented with a notion of what was truly happening, only have that twisted, and then twisted again, all funneling into an eerie finale.  If you do get a chance to see this film, make sure to take mental notes throughout as once the end is revealed, a lot of little, seemingly random and meaningless aspects of the story will make sense.  I didn't really find this movie all that scary, but it was entertaining.  I am curious about one thing, though...does every movie that incorporates hoodoo/voodoo into the storyline have to feature an old blind woman with the milky eyes?  It sure seems like it...<br /><br />The picture, presented in widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic, looks sharp and clear, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio, available in English, Spanish, and French, comes through richly.  In terms of extras, the DVD is engorged with special feature requiring nearly the same amount of time to sift through as it did to watch the film.  There's like ten featurettes, each running anywhere from two to ten minutes, some dealing with the making of the film, casting, real life ghost stories, a gumbo recipe, the shooting location, the music in the film, and so on...also included are over twenty minutes of deleted scenes (with optional director's commentary), a director's commentary track for the feature, English, Spanish, and French subtitles, and previews for other releases like American Pie Presents Band Camp (2005), The Ice Harvest (2005), War of the Worlds (2005), and Cinderella Man (2005).<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />I've learned quite a few things from this film...people in the south seem acutely prone to strokes, they like to listen to the song "Iko Iko" sung by The Dixie Cups, and using a VW bug to bust through a wrought iron gate is a really bad idea (at least for the car)...</p></body></html>

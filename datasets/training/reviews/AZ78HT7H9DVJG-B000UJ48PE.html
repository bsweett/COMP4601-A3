Well, with Hostel 2, you not sure if the sequel is as good or better than the first one.  If you've seen Hostel, then you know you're in for more blood and gory scenes in this sequel.<br /><br />This time, we see 3 girls lured to Slovakia by a model to the same hostel that was the last stop for some traveling foreigners.  During this time, there is a pagan festival.  One by one, these girls are lured away from each other and to their respective torture chambers.<br /><br />At the same time, we see 2 American men who are excited about their first kill in this covert killing organization.  Of course, one has second thoughts about it but the other is there to get them both pent up for their one-of-a-kind experience.<br /><br />All I can say is that this movie doesn't lack gore.  The storyline isn't too bad.</p></body></html>

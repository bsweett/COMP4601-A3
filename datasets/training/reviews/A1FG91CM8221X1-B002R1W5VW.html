<meta name="summary" content="Nicolas Cage's best performance since Leaving Las Vegas"></head><body><p>In the pantheon of con man movies (now almost a separate genre), Ridley Scott's Matchstick Men combines the witty geniality of The Sting with a little of the sardonic darkness of The Grifters and House of Games. Smoothly and impeccably done, it is the story of Roy, a master con artist whose unadmitted yet progessive guilt over his way of life has turned him into a seething, obsessive-compulsive neurotic. While his partner  (Sam Rockwell) keeps pressuring Roy to go for a big score, his therapist informs him of the existence of a long-lost teenage daughter (Alison Lohman)  from a brief, long-ago marriage. Roy's reaction to this news, his reunion with his daughter and her influence on his work comprise the story of Matchstick Men, a funny and resoundingly entertaining film with one of the most jaw-dropping surprise endings in recent memory. Rockwell and Lohman give excellent supporting performances, but it is Cage--one of the few actors who can go way over the top and take the audience with him--who steals the film with a comic performance that is perfect in every twitchy detail.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Best Movie of 2005- here's why"></head><body><p>Well, you can't argue with success.  I saw "Munich" a couple weeks ago and thought it was such a powerful film that I instantly declared it to be both the best movie of the year and Steven Spielberg's best movie since "Saving Private Ryan."  Alas, the opinion of a lowly history-studying college student means little.  As of today, "Munich" has only grossed $40 million and is shaping up to be one of the biggest commercial flops of Spielberg's career.  By contrast, "Big Momma's House 2"- the wretched sequel to the already unfunny original- grossed nearly as much in its first three days of release.  Hence why I continue to comment on Americans' love of mediocrity.<br /><br />Why has "Munich" debuted to such a mixed reaction?  It is admittedly a difficult film to watch.  So was "Schindler's List," but "Munich" is admittedly less of a milestone, and hence is lacking the publicity it would need to still pull people in.  However, this is still a fast-paced, well-acted, and powerful piece of cinema, and for those reasons alone is a good way to spend two and a half hours (that just breeze by).  However, it is also a frighteningly timely warning about the dangers and moral ambiguities that inevitably accompany a war on terrorism, and how quickly simple vengeance can devolve into borderline murder.<br /><br />Spielberg has not been this focused in a long time- none of his 00's work approaches the quality seen here (with the exception of "Catch Me if You Can," which was much lighter fare).  Eric Bana gives the best performance of his career as a man who is friendly and righteous at first but who is quickly consumed by paranoia and the guilt of ignoring his conscience (and this is coming from someone who also loved him in "Hulk" and "Troy").  Daniel Craig seethes fury beneath a calm exterior.  Geoffrey Rush proves that, in spite of his familiarity now, he can still blend into any role with ease.  The rest of Bana's team are given compelling back stories, and all struggle to conform their moral compasses with the assassin work they're given.  There are scenes here I will never forget- a desparate attempt to save the life of a child suddenly caught in the way of an assassination attempt, the brutal revenge murder of a woman, the scenes of a man making love to his wife while also being unable to stop thinking about the murder of the Israeli athletes at Munich.  From the opening scenes, "Munich" grabs you and never lets go (if you'll forgive that cliched expression, it's appropriate here).<br /><br />More than any other movie this year, "Munich" made an impression psyche that no amount of box office indifference in the world can change.  It aspires to be something more than entertainment, and it succeeds on nearly every level.  Here's hoping that it has a "Fight Club"-like fate and finds its audience on DVD.</p></body></html>

Standing alone, DEAD MAN'S CHEST is as fine a film as any. It's a FOUR-AND-A-HALF star flick.<br /><br />In DEAD MAN'S CHEST, Johnny Depp reprises the role of Captain Jack Sparrow, this time far more fey, who is trying to avoid payment on a debt to the nefarious Davey Jones---his soul. The key to the story is literally a key, the one which opens the Dead Man's Chest, which contains---ah, but what fun would that be if I told you?<br /><br />The difficulty is that an unscrupulous East India trader has become Governor of Port Royal. In order to retrieve the key, the chest, and it's contents, the new Governor arrests the former Governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) on their wedding day, and sentences them to hang by the neck until dead for aiding in piracy---and gives Bloom the opportunity to find Jack Sparrow who is the only one who knows where the key is.<br /><br />In the meantime, Sparrow has his own problems. Now worshipped by cannibals who think he's a god, Sparrow is doing whatever he can to avoid setting foot on a ship again, where he will be easy pickings for Davey Jones. Forced by circumstance (he becomes the next planned entree) to go back to sea, he quickly runs afoul of Jones (a humanoid squid) and his equally bizarre crew aboard "The Flying Dutchman". These characters are wonderfully original and inventive.<br /><br />The majority of this two and a half hour film is loaded with fantastically well-produced action sequences, spectacular special effects, and belly laughter humor. At first a little too frenetic, DEAD MAN'S CHEST soon settles down into its own high-energy groove, and never leaves it. More traditional in its storyline than CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (here, there's a hunt for pirate treasure that must be taken, not put back), the cast, along with Director Gore Verbinski, play it to the hilt, swashbuckling (or in Depp's case, possibly swishbuckling) across the screen, cutlasses at the ready and huzzahs on their lips.<br /><br />Where DEAD MAN'S CHEST isn't playing sea monster make-believe, it is surprisingly historically accurate, and its evocation of place (Port Royal, the pirate haven of Tortuga, and Hispaniola) all ring true. There's even a nod to Shakespeare in Keira Knightley, who masquerades as a young seaman in order to stow away aboard an East Indiaman.<br /><br />Bloom and Knightley and Jack Davenport reprise their earlier roles well. Elizabeth Swann has become a pirate lass, as competent with a cutlass as any man, and Will Turner has changed from the staid village blacksmith into Douglas Fairbanks in THE BLACK PIRATE. Jack Davenport's disgraced Commodore has also gone pirate, and his scornful, bitter, wry sarcasm is delightfully British.<br /><br />If there are slight disappointments here, they are in the length of the film (at 151 minutes, it's a leviathan, and lasts about a paltry but crucial five minutes too long), and in Depp's dialogue, which lacks some of the rapier-sharp wit we've come to expect from Captain Jack, and his portrayal, which waters down, not much but just enough to be noticeable, the snide, crafty schemer that we've come to know. The film is also much darker than its predecessor, taking place largely at night and 'tween decks. If films reflect their era, then we are living through a Dark Age for sure, but mordant wit and sticking to principles may yet save the day. Huzzah!</p></body></html>

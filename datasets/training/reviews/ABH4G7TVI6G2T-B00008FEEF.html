With new director Rick Rosenthal, HALLOWEEN 2 picks up the story literally moments after where the original left off.<br /><br />We follow the wounded Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) to the Haddonfield Clinic where she's sedated and treated for her stab wounds.  Outside, deranged Michael Myers is again on the warpath, with Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) intent on stopping him once and for all.<br /><br />HALLOWEEN 2 delivers more gory moments in lieu of the suspense from the original movie (ie: a nurse gets a drill through her head, and a sexy intern is scalded and drowned in an overheated hydrotherapy pool).  Jamie Lee Curtis spends the whole film either lying on a gurney or limping through corridors in her flimsy hospital gown.  Donald Pleasence is a real treat, as he ramps up the over-acting in his role of Loomis.<br /><br />But why is the hospital so quiet?  Where are all the patients?  Doesn't anybody get sick in Haddonfield?  The semi-abandoned hospital scenes are almost cliche, but the backdrop provides lots of great ammunition for the unstoppable Michael Myers.<br /><br />HALLOWEEN 2 still stands up quite well next to the original movie.  Fans would have to wait 20 years for Jamie Lee Curtis to make her long-awaited return as Laurie in HALLOWEEN H20.</p></body></html>

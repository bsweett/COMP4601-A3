<meta name="summary" content="worth seeing in the movies, i guess"></head><body><p>thou the film itself does not gain much from the big screen (so don't feel bad if you seeit on DVD instead of movies).<br />wahlberg carries his role well, as always, he is totally believable in the role of marine sniper trained to survive against the odds.<br />also enjoyed performance by michael pena and kate mara (accent in which she spoke alone was worth going to the movies) won't tell you about the story, cuz i never do (plus many people have done it already), but will tell you i am impressed that things that are so wrong about america (and world in general) - dishonest politicians (is there any other kind?!), connections between business, politics, money and death, the disregard of human rights, the terrible general state of affairs in the world we live in - have been depicted with so much honesty.<br />very brave.<br />that is something no filmmaker would do in my country..<br />and now to the minuses - rade serbedzija is a minus to any movie, don't know why they even hire that man. i hope he is cheap.<br />danny glover got so old he was barely able to carry his role standing up, PLUS there was an annoying mumble he spoke thru throughout the movie, like he had to speak hru a mouthful of bees (or someone else's fake teeth).<br />God, that (Glover speaking) was absolutely the WORST part of the film.</p></body></html>

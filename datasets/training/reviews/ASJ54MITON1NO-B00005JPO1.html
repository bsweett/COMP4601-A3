Even the construction of some of these scenes, seemed to be lacking in detail, as far as continuity is concerned. Plus, Harrison Ford is noticably older, and so is Karen Allen, who was missing in the last two films. The point being, maybe they should not have waited this long to put out another film.</p></body></html>

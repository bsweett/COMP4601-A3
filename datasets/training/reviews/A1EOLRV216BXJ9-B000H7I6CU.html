<meta name="summary" content="Not just for the CG and the excitement - cool outlook and warm within"></head><body><p>Neither a car nor a sports fan, I can still experience the excitement and fuss over the race as depicted in the first 15 minutes of the film. The CG is so real that one can't tell the difference between the real thing in some of the scenes.<br /><br />What fascinates me is the last hour when McQueen (Owen Wilson) reached Radiator Springs and bonded with the local folk. The scene is breathtaking, the story of the former glory well captured and things got interesting when Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) started to flex his muscles. All these made the final race in California more sentimental and much anticipated than ever. The message is clear, whether it will be heeded is another matter, but it is very worth telling.</p></body></html>

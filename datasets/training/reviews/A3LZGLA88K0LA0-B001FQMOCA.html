<meta name="summary" content="THAT RING OF FIRE"></head><body><p>WALK THE LINE is a well done, convincing portrait of one of country music's greatest stars.  While not a fan of Mr. Cash myself, I learned a lot more about the man via this movie.  Why it works undoubtedly is the performances given by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.  Having won Golden Globes for their performances, the two stars are up for Oscars this Sunday as well, and Ms. Witherspoon is a frontrunner.<br /><br />Phoenix captures the essence of Cash in his physical movements, although ironically, he's probably got a better singing voice than Cash.  He evolves from the starstruck youth to a confident star, although he falls victim to alcohol and drugs.<br /><br />Witherspoon doesn't quite lose her Legally Blonde persona, but as the darkhaired June Carter, she excels in evincing the emotional upheaval Cash brought into her life.<br /><br />Ginnifer Goodwin as Vivian, Cash's first wife, does a fine job as she watches Cash grow further and further from his family life and into Carter's arms.  Robert Patrick is good as Cash's distant and seemingly insensitive father and country/pop singer Shelby Lynne makes a convincing Mama Cash.<br /><br />While James Mangold's direction is very good, the movie itself seems a little too sanitized at times, although exposing Cash's weaknesses is commendable.  A good biopic all around.</p></body></html>

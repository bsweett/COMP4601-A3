<meta name="summary" content="Perhaps one of the funniest movies of all times."></head><body><p>Wow, This is a hilarious movie, probably one of the funniest<br />American movies I have ever seen. Bringing in the use of puppets as used by other series like "The Thunderbirds" , Matt Stone<br />and Trey Parker have hit gold with this movie. Wow where do I start.<br /><br />Originally Trey Park and Matt Stone were set to direct a spoof<br />of "The Day After Tommorow" but that plan was soon removed.<br /><br />They then decided to make "Team America World Police" released<br />by Paramount.<br /><br />This is a movie that is undergoing such buzz in Hollywood and has gotten worldwide attention among movie fans, clearly this is a movie that is unique.<br /><br />Matt Stone and Trey Parker have done what other directors have failed to do in the last few years, used a funny movie to create great satire centering on todays corrupt politics, and worldview ,not to mention our  over emphasis fear on "Terrorism" and American ideals.<br /><br />The movie main plot is that a group of Americans are part of a secret police that well polices the world under the name "Team America" lol Well they hunt down terrorist like Osama Bin<br />Laden and others while acting as diplomatically incorrect as possible.<br /><br />The scene which spoofs Hans Blitzer a weapons inspector against Korean Dictaor Mr. Cho is hilarious. While Matt and Trey obviously are not trying to make a political movie,<br />they obviously gives us their interpretation of what not only goes on in the mind of a terrorist, but the corrupt and often  nonexistent plans that the US has in getting these terrorist.<br /><br />Speaking of which the first frame of the movie is pure comedy as the Team America within a span of five minutes are able to track down Osama Bin Laden, something the poor and disorganized Administration of George Bush and the military has failed to do since September 11<br /><br />Of course theirs spoofs of movies like the Matrix with the Team America often battling with hilarous, over the top martial arts kicks and punches, but its all done with such lack of precision that you cant help but die laughing at the screen.<br /><br />The movie while undergoing tremendous success at the box office and praise from fans, has gotten many cheapshots from many so called professional critics who are anything but professional.<br /><br />Roger Ebert said the movie was nihilistic , lame and that Trey and  Matt'ss attempt was to make fun of "anyone who cares about the war" like Sean Penn.<br /><br />Yet Ebert doesnt mention that spoiled celebrities like Sean Penn and Alec  Baldwin  who say they "care" about the war have an agenda and are using the war to clean their image.<br /><br />Richard Roper on the other hand, gave a great review, calling it a  great piece of satire and that he enjoyed the jokes.<br /><br />However, Trey and Matt also give a nice ode to the troops<br />in America by the song delivered "Freedom isn't Free".<br />Freedom is not free many Americans died for our Freedom<br />and we should never forget that, if it wasn't for the sacrifices<br />of others, we wouldn't have the world we have today.<br /><br />Overall though , "Team America World Police" from the creators of South Park is absolutely  funny that has to be seen over and over again.<br /><br />I can see a couple of months down the line that DVD release of this movie like Fahrenheit 911 is sure to be a huge hit, so see this funny movie now.</p></body></html>

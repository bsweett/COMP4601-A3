<meta name="summary" content="Grab the popcorn and enjoy an Iron-clad summer HIT!"></head><body><p>One of the great pleasures of summer is the release of the big budget, popcorn films that feed the eye with amazing special effects and take the movie goer on an action-packed thrill ride!  Not all summer films achieve the goal of pleasing the masses but this new movie, based on the Marvel comic book hero, Iron Man, does just that!<br /><br />  Robert Downey Jr., the talent and charismatic actor who received an Oscar nod for his turn in "Chaplin", takes on the role of Tony Stark, an extremely wealthy man whose fortune has been amassed by providing weapons to the world's warriors, good and bad.  After being abducted and held by terrorists in the Middle East, Stark realizes the damage his weapons are doing and decides to change the path of his business.  After escaping from his captors using an armor he creates during his abduction, Stark returns to the U. S. and begins working on an improved version that will allow him to fight the forces he has empowered with his own, technologically advanced weaponry.  Thus, the birth of Iron Man, a super hero with a flashy red and gold suit of armor that packs a treasure trove of crime fighting gadgets that would make even Batman jealous!<br /><br />  Aiding Stark is Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), his dedicated executive assistant and apparent future love interest and his best friend Lt. Col. James Rhodes (Terrence Howard).  Jeff Bridges plays Stark's mentor and father figure, Obadiah Stone, a man who took young Tony under his wing after the death of the elder Stark and groomed him to take over the Stark empire.  All three actors do a great job with their parts, especially Paltrow and Bridges.  Hopefully Howard's character will grow in the inevitable sequel.  And, of course, there is the usual Stan Lee cameo, which is quite funny in this film.<br /><br />  Jon Favereau did a great job with this movie and apparently pleased fans and non-fans alike, considering its impressive take thus far, both domestically and internationally.  Although I was a comic book kid growing up, I never read the Iron Man comic books but I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I have to give kudos to Marvel for really making sure that their latest hero films are up to par---Spiderman (other than Spidey 3, which was a disaster), the X-Men films and now Iron Man have all been well made and appeal to everyone.<br /><br />  Grab a friend, buy some popcorn and sit back and relax with the first blockbuster of the summer!  Highly recommend!!</p></body></html>

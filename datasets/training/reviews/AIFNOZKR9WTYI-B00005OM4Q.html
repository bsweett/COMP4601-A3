But this gets about 30 seconds of screen time. For the rest of the time, you get to hear the protagonist getting nagged by his cliche mother who urges him at regular intervals, &quot;Don't do drugs!&quot; You also get to hear him getting the runaround while on tour with the Abe Smellman Group - a band with no appeal, no talent, no existence. The highlight of this band's creativity is when the lead guitarist drops acid and announces, &quot;I am a golden god!&quot; The movie is more or less This is Spinal Tap, with a fifteen year old journalist thrown in... oh yes, and a sixteen year old groupie who bangs all the rockers. That's wholesome, isn't it? Well, its supposed to be. You are not supposed to come walking outta the theater wondering why these guys aren't getting sent up for statutory rape.</p></body></html>

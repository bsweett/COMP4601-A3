<meta name="summary" content="Not the best "Bond" film.  MI6 DATASTREAM on DVD is excellent."></head><body><p>I was hyped and excited this being the 40th Anniversary and 20th film in the James Bond series. The first 25 minutes of the movie is "attention-getting". Great idea Pierce Brosnan had for a story. The delightful Samantha Bond is back as "Miss Moneypenny". They gave her a scene you may never forget. Dame Judi Dench is nice to see again. John Cleese returns this time as the Quartermaster. Desmond Llewelyn passed away in 1999 from a car accident.<br /> Halle Berry as "Jinx" did not impress me.<br /> Toby Stephens, you might dislike as "Gustav Graves" from the beginning. However, I just adore his mother, Maggie Smith and the work she has done.<br /><br /> This film had some special effects that really was too much and unbelievable to take. Let's not get too carried away with the CGI effects. James Bond on the glacier ice water-skiing with parachutes effect looked so fake. It even looked computer animated. And it was.<br /> Advancing technology is fine. Creating new, interesting gadgets is fine too. Some of the "Q" gadgets in past films have become reality in the present. Keep it real, guys.<br /> What I thought was really cool and possibly the coolest villain yet was Rick Yune as "Zao". Great invention of a villain with a diamond-pelted face.<br /> Rosamund Pike as "Miranda Frost" was refreshing.<br />  All in all I was disappointed with Die Another Day (2002), but I thought Pierce Brosnan deserved to make one more movie as "James Bond". This is his last as 007.<br /> If you have seen this film before, click on "Q Branch". Then select "MI6 Database" below. Click "MI6 Database" "ON".

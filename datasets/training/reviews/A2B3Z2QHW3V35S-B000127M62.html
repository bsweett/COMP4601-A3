<meta name="summary" content="Good movie"></head><body><p>When I heard Freddy Vs Jason was coming out in theaters I didn't want to watch it. I thought it was going to be stupid. I thought it was going to be like the Mtv show. I don't remember what it is called. And I can only remember bits and pieces of it. But the makers of the show would make stars into I guess you can say 3D. I'm sure it's not 3D, but looks like it. Then they would make them fight each other in a ring.<br /><br />Well I thought that was stupid. And that is what I thought this movie was going to be about. I bought this movie anyways because I'm collecting all of Jason and Freddy movies. I just finished watching it last night. I really enjoyed it. I was half way done watching this movie when my husband walked in from work. I started it all over again just to watch it with my hubby.</p></body></html>

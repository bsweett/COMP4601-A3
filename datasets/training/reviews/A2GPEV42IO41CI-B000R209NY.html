But first, we meet the unsuspecting partygoers:  Father (Kurt Russell) and daughter (Emmy Rossum), handsome and conceited gambler (Josh Lucas), single mom and her small son, and rich but depressed businessman (Richard Dreyfuss).  The surprise wave turns the ship over, there are countless causalities, but who will survive the climb to the top, er, bottom?<br /><br />Comparisons with the Irwin Allen original are natural, but they really are very different movies.  The 1972 version was character-driven.  We knew a lot about the personalities and histories of the main cast and cared about them.  There was a lot of inter-personal drama that was quite enjoyable and special effects were limited to the upside-down roll of the ship.  The new "Poseidon" is all about the CGI effects, and they are truly outstanding.  The flipping of the ship is much more violent and realistic this time around, and it's just the start of the action.  And there are enough underwater scenes to have you holding your own breath as you are caught up in the excitement.  We know almost nothing about the characters, but that didn't bother me as the star of the show is the explosive action.<br /><br />The director maintains a high level of tension throughout the film; the danger never lets up, and the pace is quick.  We know some of the cast won't survive, but we don't know who, and that keeps us involved.  (I was surprised no one said, "Let's climb to the bottom of the ship and get out that way; you know, like they did in "The Poseidon Adventure"!)  Action fans will surely enjoy this non-stop thrill ride.  Heartily recommended.</p></body></html>

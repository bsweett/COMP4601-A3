<meta name="summary" content="Now, This is a Great Film!"></head><body><p>"Taxi Driver" is a classic, no matter what anyone says.  It's even considred one of the best 100 films of all time by the American Film Institute.  That alone says a lot, because a film donesn't reach that spot by accident.  This is a timely classic that continues to entertain people all around over and over again.<p>Directed by the great Martin Scorsese, this is the story about a man named, Travis Bickle.  He cannot sleep so he decides to be a taxi driver by night.  From his job he has seen the worst of the worst, and every day he seems to be losing his mind.  He turns psychotic every day and it only gets worse.  It eventually gets to the point where Travis wants to kill someone; anyone.  This is a terrifying glimpse into the darkest parts of city life that very few dare to explore.  This is the tale of one man who has had enough.<p>The movie is very well directed and written.  It is beautiful, dark, and haunting.  Disturbing as it may be, the story has such realism to it.  Robert De Niro outdoes himself in this film.  You can sense his drifting into madness so clear that it's scary.  They could have not achieved this goal if they had casted someone else for the role.<p>My favorite scene in the movie has to be when De Niro is talking to the secret service man.  It's so funny and yet so chilling at the same time.  And, of course, who can forget watching De Niro talking to himself in the mirror.  "You talkin' to ME?"<p>This new DVD version is beautiful.  The picture quality is outstanding, considering how old this film is, and that I once had the older version that just came out when DVDs were only getting started.  Lots of special features on this disk.  If you have the older version of this movie and you love this picture, I urge you to go and get this newer version of the DVD.  It is ten times better.<p>This is a classic, and no one can ever take that away.  However, keep in mind that since this is a classic, it does not mean that you will like the movie.  I cannot tell you if you will like it or not, and neither can anybody else.  Just because "Citizen Kane" is a classic didn't change the fact that I didn't like that movie.  If you are currious to see it, then rent it and see if you enjoy it.  Even if it turns out that you don't like it, I clearly doubt that this will be the worst rental you will choose.  "Taxi Driver" is a magnificent work of art, and it is film-making like you have never seen.  A great movie that can never be duplicated.  A spectacular film.  Not one single complaint here.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""I've *done* Superman!""></head><body><p>I don't know what it would be like viewed normally, but we went to see the IMAX version with the four 3-D sequences tipped in, and it is out of this world!  The whole theater was filled with the sounds of the audience screaming and crying and gasping and applauding, the way very few movie experiences inspire one to do.  Afterwards we just lay there flattened out as though run over by a bulldozer or after the pleasures of orgasm.  Of the 3-D sequences, the last is disappointing after the second and third, which are visceral, passionate, full-bodied film-making.  The first one is just Superboy learning to fly, and then Clark of the present remembering himself as a boy on Jonathan and Martha's farm way back when.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey, who I don't llike in general, was great in this and well worth every penny, but Parker Posey, who must have been somewhat cheaper, was just as good, making you wonder if stars are really needed in these big ticket blockbuster.  If you ask me, Kate Bosworth wasn't old enough to play Lois properly, or to play anyone with a child, her anorexic body doesn't seem developed enough to have given birth in the past, especially to a little boy who might actually be a super-baby.  Bosworth tries hard, but she's simply miscast, they might have found someone 25 or 30 to play the part.  She's got something, and the more I got into the picture I found her screen chemistry with Brandon Rotuh fairly overpowering, but at the end of the day she just was too young.  Maybe in the sequel, if they maake a sequel.<br /><br />What about it, Warner Brothers?  You might be disappointed with the box office returns, but millions of fans have seen the film and most of us have loved it!  We'd see another if you let Bryan Singer do it again.  Okay, maybe the little boy was kind of an ugly tyke, with that messy hair he didn't look like the little rich boy he was supposed to be playing, but some kind of savage from Appalachia or somewhere where they don't have hair scissors.  He was silent where he should have talked, and when he talked, he didn't seem very bright.  I'm sure his mother moves him in real life, but casting agents, Hollywood is filled with cute, talented child sctors, is this the best you could do for the biggest child's part in decades?  Otherwise this was the movie of the year, if you were lucky enough to watch it on tbe IMAX screen and scream your lungs out, especially when the growing crystal city snags Lex Luthor's big yacht, the GERTRUDE, and lifts it high into the air until the front and rear parts of it threaten to snap off in 3-D!</p></body></html>

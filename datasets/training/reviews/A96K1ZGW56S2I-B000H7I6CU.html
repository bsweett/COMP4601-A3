It's the biggest racing event of the year and there are three favorites to win:  conceited Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton), The King and reigning champion Strip Weathers (Richard Petty), and young maverick Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson).  McQueen seems to be a sure bet to win, but at the finish line the race ends in a three-way tie.  The officials decide that a run-off race between the three cars will be held in L.A.<br /><br />On the road trip across the country to L.A., Lightning finds himself stranded in the dessert.  After a late night chase with a cop, McQueen finds himself in the jail of small town Radiator Springs.  The judge, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) sentences McQueen to refinish the road he destroyed.  Time is running out until the big race off in L.A., but his community service allows McQueen to finally know and understand that the most important things in life don't necessarily involve living in the fast lane.<br /><br />CARS was faulted by many critics at the time of its initial release as being a good movie with some impressive voice talent, but, nevertheless, the worst of Pixar's films.  There's a reason for this.  CARS is all about small towns, NASCAR, and Route 66.  Most critics live either on the West Coat, the East Coast, or in Chicago.  The movie greatly appeals to middle America, the heartland of the country.  For someone used to a metropolitan lifestyle, CARS must be difficult to understand.  However, for anyone who lives in middle American or who has an interest in NASCAR or Route 66, CARS is a film that you will probably adore.  I know I do.</p></body></html>

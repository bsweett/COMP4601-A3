<meta name="summary" content="A Fun Movie For Fans"></head><body><p>"Red Eye" is a throw back to the days of Hitchcock, when movies were more of a mind trip and what would I do in that situation. That is the case here in this film. As I watched this movie, I thought about what I would do if this happened to me. Wes Craven, even though I love his other movies, has proven that he can do other things besides slashers and be amaazing.<br /><br />The acting in the film was really well done and I wasn't disappointed at all with who I was watching this movie for, Cillian Murphey. He is one of the most talented recent actors to emerge. No matter how many times I see him in a movie, he always amazes me. As in Batman Begins, he makes an excellent villain. Rachel did an equally amazing job in the movie. Like I said, I tried to figure out what I would do in her place and it shows the acting talents of both the heroine and the villain.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a fan of thrillers and movies that put you in that situation, this movie is for you. I highly recommend this film to both fans of thrillers and the actors/actresses who are in this movie. I don't think it needs a sequel, but I could see one being done.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Almost makes you not want to fall in love"></head><body><p>There is a difference to me between making a film with relationships connecting in different ways because it's logical and that's where it would most likely go, while others look like it was written just simply to see it happen. Closer is one of those films that halfway through you just ask "why am I watching this anyway?"<br /><br />Dan and Alice catch each other's eyes walking on the street in London. But Alice's unknowing of England's traffic direction gets her hit by a taxi. And so a relationship blooms. Months later(or years it's never mentioned), he decides to write a book about Alice's escapades(she's a former stripper). While being photographed for the book jacket, he lusts after the photographer Anna but she rejects him. In a weird way to take revenge he impersonates her in an online sex room(probably the funniest but awkwardest scenes I've seen) and wants to meet. Imagine the shock that the real Anna actually shows up and they get married.<br /><br />And basically the film is a big series of turnabouts. When the characters are with the one they love, they long for the one they really love. And so basically each man has sex with each woman and it's basically like a big orgy with none of the other characters participating. You just wonder "can't you 4 just move in together and sleep with whoever?"<br /><br />To me the 2 better performances are Clive Owen and Natalie Portman. He comes across as a kind of cold-hearted man but just really direct and forward and emotional but in a more menacing way. She plays her character as someone who justs wants things to work out but things just get in the way. In the Professional(or Leon in some cases) she played a young almost Lolita type while here it's almost full blown but there's still this aura of innocence with Natalie that makes her character a bit tragic.<br /><br />Jude Law almost looks like he's sleepwalking through the film and Julia Roberts looks quite miscast. Her character calls for her to be a bit detached about all the wrongdoings that she does, an almost who cares attitude but she doesn't come across that well.<br /><br />If you're in a "that b****/***hole broke my heart" mood, this film's perfect but taken generally, it's kind of unneccesary, if only to watch Natalie in a stripper role(no guys, she does not show anything, sorry).</p></body></html>

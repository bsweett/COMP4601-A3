<meta name="summary" content="Amazing Adventure Political Thriller"></head><body><p>This is a great film.  Mark Wahlberg is always reliable for turning in a quality performance so sometimes he can be taken for granted.  Remember how he shocked everyone with his excellent performance in Boogie Nights?  Well here he possesses an amazingly strong constant presence that never lets up.  He is an action adventure superstar.<br /><br />The simple basis of the plot is that he is a shooter for the war/government in retirement and is called upon to undertake a special mission.  That is all I will say for nothing else about this movie is simple.<br /><br />The movie is a high octave full force action thriller and the action sequences are amazing lighting up the screen.  There is graphic violence but it is very well executed and fits the format of the film.  It is not gratuitous.  The film is also a thriller with a strong political edge.  How all this mixes together so expertly is due to the true craftsmen who have put this film together.  And Wahlberg allows the strong esemble cast to shine and does not try to steal the show even though it is totally his.<br /><br />This movie literally blew me away.  I really did love it.  It is over 2 hours in length and the time flew by with action and shocks and plot twist too many to mention.  Highly recommend.</p></body></html>

And kinda-sorta good fun to watch. Best thing about it is seeing McLovin again, except this time as a stuffed-nose anarchist. Nicholas Cage was pretty good, even if he was acting like a robot. The appearance of bottled rage, perhaps? The mafia boss was not really that dangerous-looking, at least not until he shot that kid in cold blood in the middle of the street. Yuck.</p></body></html>

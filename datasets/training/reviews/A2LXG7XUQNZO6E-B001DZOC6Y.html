The acting was incredibly hokey, I kept waiting for a punchline, and there's really no resolution but I did find many of the suicide sequences to be absolutely chilling. I wouldn't say I'm the biggest Mark Wahlberg fan but his performance was positively Oscar worthy in comparison to the "caught in the high beams" look on Zooey Deschanel's mug throughout the run time. I don't intend for this to sound mean-spirited but she's just not a good actress, much of her work seems to feature the same wide-eyed, emotionless, monotone-speaking character. As a love interest and leading lady, I feel she was a poor choice for this role.<br /><br />The comic relief in The Happening was awkward, the tender moments between Wahlberg and Deschanel were unconvincing and the resolution was...well...a preachy non-resolution. Yeah, I said preachy, what normally would work better as subtext becomes text here and it's handled clumsily. There is no punchline, there is no twist, what you see is what you get and what you get is a predictable and pretty darn pedestrian episode of The Outer Limits or The Twilight Zone.<br /><br />I didn't turn off the DVD or get up and walk away while the film was playing; I was interested in what was happening, I wanted to know more about the situation, and despite Zooey Deschanel's Robby The Robot impersonation I actually cared about the characters for some strange reason. Unfortunately, The Happening just didn't hit the spot, it all felt so cheesy and heavy-handed. If you're an M. Night Shyamalan fan, you'll probably come away from this a tad bit disappointed; be sure to rent first.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Samuel L Jackson shines in this mediocrity"></head><body><p>Let's start by saying most people think Quentin Tarentino is a genuis or a hack.  I feel closer towards the later.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick created the non-linear time movie with his masterpiece, The Killing.  The reason that it worked in that film was that Kubrick used this technique to simplify the storytelling.  He took each scene to its conclusion.  Then went to the next scene from the start even if it was before the conclusion of the last scene.<br /><br />In this film it is used as a way to cover a mediocre script and direction.  This film was not editted in time sequence.  The film jumps back and forth in time with no reason.  For example, there is a scene where one of the characters is killed and five minutes later he is alive again.  The reason why, who knows for sure.  The one thing is that most people who loved the film usually are talking about all the graphic violence not the plot.<br /><br />Critics hailed this film but most were not talking about the movie by the film maker.  This is another case of critics wanting to create a new star (and in their own way become the one who discovered him.)  This was one where they talked or wrote more about Tarantino and not the film.<br /><br />The one good thing in this film was a stellar performance by Samuel L Jackson.  He is one of those actors that Hollywood doesn't know what to do with and he once again shows his great talent. (But I would say don't waste your money on this if you are a fan of his there are many better films.)<br /><br />If you want to see a great action pact film with great style then get Kubrick's The Killing, Danny Boyle's Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie's Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrells.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Too Clever By Half"></head><body><p>I love both Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer but I don't have a lot of positive things to say about this movie. I found it too talky and its plot was not believable. It was really hard for me to suspend my disbelief while watching it. None of the characters were endearing and it was a challenge to care about what happened to them. Also, in real life, there would be no chemistry between Downey's character and the female lead, Ms. Monaghan. Her history and the reprehensible manner in which she treats him would preclude his devotion (unless he was a complete masochist). Further, and to my disappointment as I'm an extremely politically incorrect person, I found all the gay jokes about Kilmer's Perry obtuse. I really don't think anyone cares about that stuff much in this day and age. Overall, the interactions are too clever by half, and Downey's narration is a bore. Most of what's supposed to be funny...is not--a waste of time in my view.</p></body></html>

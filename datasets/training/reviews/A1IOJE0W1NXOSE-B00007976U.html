<meta name="summary" content="Riveting psychological drama"></head><body><p>Sy Parrish has no life,so he adopts that of a family of customers<br />who bring their photographs for developing to the store where he works.  Their seemingly happy family life is in complete contrast to his own lonely, stark existence.  His apartment is symbolically white with very little furniture or decorations other than the hundreds of photos he has taken of the Yorkin family and put up on his wall.  He gently insinuates himself into the Yorkins' life by attending the son's soccer practice and striking up a conversation with the wife at a fast food restaurant.  Things come to a head when Sy discovers that all is not well in the Yorkin home and he sets out to extract revenge from an unfaithful family member.  Robin Williams' performance is wonderful, down to the last detail and he draws the viewer into the ever-deepening abyss of his gentle madness.  The photography, imagery, music, and set design all contribute to an engrossing viewing experience.</p></body></html>

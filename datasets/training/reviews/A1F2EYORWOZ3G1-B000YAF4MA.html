I finally broke down and rented it and I'm so glad I did.<br />I've read some other reviews and agree with some of them.<br />But, what I got out of this movie goes a lot deeper.<br />This movie speaks to me of the ties in human nature. The ties to family, to our work, our identity, our ideals, our religion and even to strangers. There are countless ties that bind us each and every moment of every day. How tight the tie is depends on the moment, the situation, other who are present.<br />In this movie, the main characters loosen their ties and focus on themselves. They set out to accomplish things they wish they had done in their life....before their death.<br />This movie also shows how reaching a dream isn't done alone. Whether we think about it or not, we do not live alone in this world. However, how much consideration do we often have toward each other? Even those who are 'invisible' to us most of the time?<br />I can't begin to tell you how deep you can go with the thoughts provoked in this movie. But I will tell you this. If you see only one movie to shake the cobwebs out of your brain and make you aware of 'Life'... this should be it.<br />Cudos to Rob Reiner and all that went into this movie. Definiely a classic.</p></body></html>

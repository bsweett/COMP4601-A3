Pregnant at sixteen is the unwitting challenge of her few years, one that she undertakes with such detached sarcasm her champions wonder if she really understands the scope of what's happening.  It is that aloof attitude that keeps Juno, her family and friends from being saddled with an otherwise intensely dramatic situation.  Or does it?  I found myself wondering if this film considered itself something teens and adults alike should relate to, with all its witty banter and smarmy camaraderie, or should we embrace such situations exactly as Juno, with a removed understanding of our strengths and limitations and the knowledge that our actions stand to impact a great many others, potentially in wonderful and terrifying ways?<br /><br />Juno hits the mark, and it does so in a refreshingly smart way.  If you want an underlying moral of the story you will find one.  If you want fast-paced tight lines from relatable characters it's all there.  Or you can just take the film at face value--the stellar big screen break-out creation of Diablo Cody, a woman with a keen eye for calling life like it is.</p></body></html>

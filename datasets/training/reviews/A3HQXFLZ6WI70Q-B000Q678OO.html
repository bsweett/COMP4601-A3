<meta name="summary" content="Weird but awesome"></head><body><p>This is one hell of a weird movie but it is a good weird. Weird like Fight Club, Donnie Darko, Inception, Space Odyssey, Requiem for a Dream, etc. Very good audio and video. But the dialogue is a bit hard to catch since it's spoken in thick British accent.</p></body></html>

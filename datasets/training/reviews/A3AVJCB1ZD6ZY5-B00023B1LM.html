<meta name="summary" content="Bourne again?"></head><body><p>He comes to on a fishing boat with bullets in his back and no idea how he got there, who shot him, or why. Oh, and he's got a bank account number on his body.<br /><br />When he goes to the bank, the safe deposit box is full of money and at least half a dozen passports with different identities.  So, which one is his?  In some ways, he has a chance to start a new life--but the old one really isn't leaving him behind.<br /><br />People are chasing him--with guns.  More important than that, how does he know just how to evade them?<br /><br />"Bourne" is a riveting story about a man who's in a terrible position and unable to really know who is friend or foe.  This film has one of the best car chase scenes I have ever encountered--with a Mini Cooper, no less!  The book was good, the film almost better.</p></body></html>

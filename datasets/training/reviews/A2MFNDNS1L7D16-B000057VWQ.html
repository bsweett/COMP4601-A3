<meta name="summary" content="An America that was."></head><body><p>Or was it really ever thus? Small town America before World WarII: innocent, insular & secure. I"m not sure. I am sure it is the pinnacle of American movie making & story telling.  The scene, at the end when Clarence takes  George on a journey through his life is on par with The Christmas Carol. But I hope nobody tries to remake this. Jimmy Steward, Donna Reed, Henry Travers & a glimpse of the great Lionel Barrymore. You'll recognize the rest. You haven't seen It's a Wonderful Life? You must be ten. You will.</p></body></html>

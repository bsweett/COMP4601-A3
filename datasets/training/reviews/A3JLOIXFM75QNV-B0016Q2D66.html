<meta name="summary" content="Morose and not always pleasant"></head><body><p>Revolutionary Road begins in an almost promising manner with a seemingly content couple meeting, then sort of flash forwards into their lives to a sunny suburb where they live in a lovely home with children, and everything seems peachy.<br /><br />Unfortunetely underneath their calm exteriors, the couple, played to perfection by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio really aren't all that happy with their lives.<br /><br />The plot is both simple and complex. The film is really about the emotions of the characters. The distrust, deception, adultery- you name it and it can be found in this film.<br /><br />It is not always pleasant to watch but you almost can't stop watching the pair of spectacular actors do their thing. If it weren't for them, I don't think the film would be as interesting.<br /><br />Truthfully, after watching it, I can't really make up my mind as to whether I liked this film or not. It is an odd type of film where really you should despise every character and their situation, and yet you find something redeaming along the way.<br /><br />The film is certainly a downer and I'm not sure of a second viewing. It is a well-crafted movie with minor flaws which don't really detract but make it that much harder to enjoy it.  It certainly makes you think and I suppose it accomplishes that much at least.</p></body></html>

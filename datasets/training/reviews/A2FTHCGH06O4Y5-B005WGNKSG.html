<meta name="summary" content="gratuitous rape scenes"></head><body><p>A rather forgettable serial killer movie.  The thing that's always gonna stick out in my mind, though, is that in the first half of the movie there are three very brutal and graphic rape scenes that had nothing to do with the plot and could have easily been dispensed with.  Really ruined the movie for my family.</p></body></html>

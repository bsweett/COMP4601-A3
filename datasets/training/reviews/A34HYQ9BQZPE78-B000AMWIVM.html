Most people that dislike it will say because it's too gruesome and twisted for them. That's understandable, because "Saw" is one of the definitive in the infamous but small, "torture horror" subgenre. So that explains why people would dislike it, but what about the people that like it?<br />Well I, for one, loved this movie, and here's why: "Saw" is not just a movie about people getting thrown in a room and slicing their legs off with giant blades or else their friends will get decapitated. No, "Saw" is actually a lot more than just a "torture" horror film.<br />If you manage to look past the gruesome violence of this movie, what lies beneath is actually a very intelligent crime film, like a really good episode of "Law and Order" or "NYPD Blue", just with harsher graphic content.<br />This movie also shows us the villain's ideals. It tries to convince us that Jigsaw, the villain of the movie, is actually not a serial killer and just goes about showing people the value of life in his own, twisted way.<br />A lot of the movie is also a flashback to the police-story behind it, whereas the present in the movie takes places where two guys are chained down and locked into a room, set to a timer.<br />This "Saw" is actually a little less graphic than any of its following sequels, save for a gory headshot and sawing through your own ankle. But what this movie lacks in the heavier gore of its sequels, it makes up for in its exciting suspense and smart film-making.<br />Overall, "Saw" is one of those movies that you have to give a chance before you decide whether you like it or not. I'm sure glad I gave it a chance, because it showed me that rumors and popular talk can trick you into thinking whether or not a movie is good, or something like that.<br />But anyway, if you want a great horror movie, mixed in with some crime and thriller elements, give this a shot. You may just end up loving it. Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></body></html>

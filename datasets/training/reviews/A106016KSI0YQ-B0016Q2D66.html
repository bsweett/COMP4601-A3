<meta name="summary" content="American screams"></head><body><p>Richard Yates's famous 1961 novel about the wrong side of the American dream has fascinated readers (and other writers in particular) for years because of its bleak questioning of Eisenhower-Kennedy era middle-class values. The film rights were tied up for years, and finally in 2008 this beautifully shot movie adaptation came out. In 1961 the misery of Frank and April Wheeler, an idyllic couple who have compromised their youthful aspirations to be part of the creative class in order to raise their children safely in suburbia, seemed very new and incisive. But by 2008 it's hard to work up much sympathy for Frank (Leonardo di Caprio) and April (Kate Winslet) since all they seem to do is scream at each other when they're not smugly congratulating one another on how much better they are than everyone else. They're just about irredeemable characters, and even worse is the awful, artificial conceit of the electroshock patient (the son of their realtor) who comes to their house to tell them "the truth" (as Richard Yates saw it) as to their compromises and weaknesses. Without Yates's beautiful prose to carry you along you're just left with his ideas about American life, which have not aged well and carry an appalling strain of misogyny to them (especially given April's final fate and the plot reasons for it). DiCaprio is miscast in the central role of Frank, and though he works hard, he doesn't seem adult enough to carry off the part. Winslet--intelligent and alert to everything--fares much better, although even she cannot make April very sympathetic. Michael Shannon is also as good as anyone could be reasonably expected to be in the awful role of the crazy truth-teller. The film has some terrific cinematography, but it's really not worth seeing just for that: almost everything this film has to say was done much better the year before by the AMC cable series MAD MEN (where you don't have to put up with all that screaming, either).</p></body></html>

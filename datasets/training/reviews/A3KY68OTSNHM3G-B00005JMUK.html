<meta name="summary" content="The True Story of Aileen Wuornos"></head><body><p>Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci star in this graphic and true story about Aileen Wuornos, an abused prostitute who was convicted of killing at least seven men in Florida.<br /><br />Theron stars as Wuornos, while Ricci stars as Selby, a young and extremely naive girl who becomes involved, both romantically and eventually on the run with Aileen.  Aileen met Selby in the midst of her spree, and after spending time with her, she begins to fall in love.  Due to these feelings she's developed, she longs to have a real life and a real relationship with Selby.  However, she can't stop the killing.  She kills for revenge for the years of abuse she suffered, and she also kills for money for herself and Selby to survive.  Most of her victims were married men.  Aileen tries to get a "real" job, but no one will hire her due to her lack of skills.  As her life continues to crumble, even Selby begins to question her.<br /><br />Eventually, Selby finds out what is really going on with Aileen, and she cooperates with the authorities to convict Aileen of multiple murder.  After being convicted and sentenced to die, Aileen Wuornos survived for twelve years on Death Row before finally being executed in October of 2002.  Aileen and Selby never spoke to each other after Aileen's trial.<br /><br />This is a very good movie.  Charlize Theron's portrayal of Aileen Wuornos won her an Academy Award for best actress.  Christina Ricci's performance of the confused and easily-influenced Selby was excellent as well.  Be warned: the violence and language contained in this movie makes it suitable for mature audiences only.  I highly recommend this film.  Watch and learn about one of history's most notorious serial killers.</p></body></html>

While this was happening, Admiral Kirk was helping to train a new crew of mostly cadets on the Enterprise and, as fate\writers would have it, happened to be in the area when Khan takes an interest in the Genesis project. From there we learn more about Kirk's past, get introduced to new characters (Lt. Saavik), here Kirk yell "KHHAAAAAAANNN" (love that), and get the plot device to make the next movie.<br /><br />Despite several liberties taken with the previous story line, like Chekov being recognized by Khan when he was not cast in "Space Seed", this gets most important elements right and is a good representation of the Star Trek franchise.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></body></html>

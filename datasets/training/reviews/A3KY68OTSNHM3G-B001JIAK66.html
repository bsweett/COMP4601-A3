<meta name="summary" content="A Thrilling Movie With Awesome Special Effects"></head><body><p>Hugh Jackman stars in this exciting movie as Van Helsing,a former priest who is sent by the clergy to Transylvania to save the final surviving members of a family who have been fighting Dracula for four centuries.  These surviving members will be doomed to extinction unless Dracula is destroyed before the last family member dies.  So Van Helsing and is trusty sidekick Carl (David Wenham) set off to face Dracula with an arsenal of weapons to aid them, including a cool repeating crossbow.<br /><br />One in Transylvania, Van Helsing and Carl meet Anna Valerious, played by Kate Beckinsale. It is her family that has been trying to destroy Dracula for so long.  Now, the three must band together to kill Dracula before it is too late for Anna.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie, and the special effects are some of the best that I've ever seen before.  The beginning of the movie was my favorite part.  The black and white scenes of the attack on Castle Frankenstein reminded me of the Frankenstein movies from the 1930s with Boris Karloff.  Even the scene in which the townspeople burn down the windmill with Dr. Frankenstein and his monster trapped inside is carefully reproduced from the original film.  The monsters in the movie are really scary as well, especially the werewolf which attacks Anna's brother.  Dracula's "wives" flying and attacking the townsfolk while Van Helsing shoots at them with his crossbow is exciting to watch, as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.  Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, and David Wenham give excellent performances, but Richard Roxburgh's portrayal as Dracula is the best performance of the movie.  Shuler Hensley does a fine job as well as Frankenstein's monster.  Watch this exciting and thrilling movie and see the Wolfman, Frankenstein, and Dracula all together in the same film.</p></body></html>

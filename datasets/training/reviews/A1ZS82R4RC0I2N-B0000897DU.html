<meta name="summary" content="The Real Slim Shady?"></head><body><p>Eminem`s first experience as an actor is a surprising one, developing an interesting character in a good urban drama. Curtis Hanson is the man behind the camera here, and his past work in acclaimed movies like "Wonder Boys" or "L.A. Confidential" gave him enough knowledge and recognition to get his hands on this project. <p>The story isn`t too original, but is well told and acted. Eminem plays Rabbit, a youngster from a Detroit neighbourhood with a messed life who`s trying to find his role in the world. His main passion is hip hop, so he looks to find his future in music, getting away from a life with low perspectives and choices. <p>Hanson captures well Rabbit`s story and the atmosphere of the community he lives in, showing the conflicts he must face to achieve his goal. The realistic direction and the gritty, dark photography add a natural, credible tone to the movie, showing how`s life in those convulted suburbs. The plot is deep enough and never gets too melodramatic or politically correct, despite the somewhat preachy and predictable ending.<p>Not a masterpiece, but given that most films with or about musicians are generally weak, "8 Mile" stands above average and succeeds delivering a tension-filled and well-written story, with characters worth caring about. It`s also one of the few mainstream movies that focuses on how`s life within the hip hop (sub)cultures that continue developing nowadays.<br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

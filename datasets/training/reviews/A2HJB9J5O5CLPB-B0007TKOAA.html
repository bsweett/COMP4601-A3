I have heard the frustration in reviews from folks that don't like wine lovers, Lost In Translation, or wry, witty situations.  They want belly laughs, feces jokes, more naked people, or less naked people.<br /><br />I didn't care for Paul Giamatti in American Splender.  This had less to do with Giamatti than my own distaste for characters and screenplays that whine about the human condition.  In Sideways, I got over it.  Giamatti is a very fine actor.  If you want to see the difference between good acting and poor, see Adam Sandler in Spanglish and then Giamatti in Sideways.  It's a revelation.<br /><br />The events of our buddy movie seem a bit stretched, especially the lost wallet scenes, which though funny, couldn't actually happen.  Drowning your sorrow in wine, that could happen and most of the film is pinned on the idea that two opposites from their college days could drive around picturesque wine country, get drunk, get laid, and in one character at least, learn something about the grueling trials of manly life.  Sideways is not perfect, but it does have a nutty, aromatic, fruity bouquet.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Best of them all"></head><body><p>After 4 Alien films, this is still my favorite.  A case can be made for Aliens, but to me Aliens is a straight out action film.  Alien however is a brilliant combination of horror and sci fi.  It is very creepy, but also has some intense action.  I would pick up the box set with all the bells and whistles.  While the 3rd and 4th part has some flaws, they are all worth watching.</p></body></html>

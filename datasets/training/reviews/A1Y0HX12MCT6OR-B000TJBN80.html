<meta name="summary" content="28 Plot Holes Later"></head><body><p>28 Days Later was an excellent horror movie that revived the zombie genre (before 14 year old kids who laugh at Chuck Norris jokes and masturbate to 300 killed it again) similar to Romero's Night of the Living Dead. So director Juan Tacos Burritos took the next logical step in the story and centered it around the military trying to re-establish civilization in a small sect in London called district 1, even though London all around them still rots with dead bodies and likely still harbors the infection.<br /><br />Anyways one of the characters played by Robert Caryle survived the outbreak and is given the job of caretaker, where he has access to everywhere inside the district assigned by the military... why? The movie never hints that he was in the military, he doesn't act like a military man and sure doesn't walk like one, so either the army is handing out these extrodinarily private security tasks to random civilians or the movie needs plot convenience to move along.<br /><br />So Robert Caryle's two kids Maggintoggle Poots and Imogen Toots reunite with him and miss their mother, so they decide to sneak back into infected unsafe London to grab memorabillia and pictures, because patience is for suckaz. So two little kids sneak out of a heavily armed and guarded military base that is under heavy survellience by going on the side of one of the bridges, don't worry as the movie progresses you'll come to realize this is the most inept militia ever. Eventually they discover their mother in their old house, who's still alive and dormantly carries the infection in her. But if she can do that, other people presumably can too, but you never see them in 28 Days Later, so I just presumed that they got beaten to death or something when this plot point came up. However the mother who was in a house in the excellent opening sequence got trapped in a room with the infected flooding in, they didn't beat her to death? Did they leave her alone, because they could sense the infection or something? Did they just puke blood on her and leave? Not really a plot hole but something that bothered me.<br /><br />So the military scientist's find out about the mom's situation and leave her restrained in a room with 0 guards and non-monitered survellience. Robert Caryle, using his handy dandy plot inconvienience card get past all the sercurity to the detained rare subject who can be the cure to infection, and after leaving her to die decides to start macking on her, knowing fully well about the infection, that she was left out in the infected London wastes, and not even asking what she went through, decides to start sharing saliva with her, until suprise suprise, he gets infected. Now many of my friends have argued whether or not she did that on purpose to get revenge, but if she indeed infect her husband out of revenge she got brutally killed afterwards, hundreds of people died, and her kids lives were in peril, so yeah, great revenge plan mom.<br /><br />So the now-infected Robert Caryle (probably still weilding his access card) runs around the military compound and kills multiple soldier's who were presumably trained to deal with the infected, and ends up killing all of them. One unarmed infected man without armor vs approximately twenty armed guards. Hm. The rest of the military is alerted and stuffs all of the civillians in a dark cramped basement for their safety, forgetting that the back door is unlocked and Robert Caryle-zombie has apparently found it and broke in. Now people have compared this level of military incompetance to the American troops in the Middle East, politics aside that sounds like a slap-dash excuse of "oh yeah, we meant for those soldiers to be s***ty at their jobs, see it's like topical and current!" I don't buy it.<br /><br />So the people start pouring out of the basement out into the streets were snipers are poised, and chaos breaks out via shakey cam and the snipers shoot to kill everyone basically, wait are the military guys incompetent fools? I don't understand, please movie, spell that point out for me more. So the people in hiding are intercepted by two soldiers, Jermey Renner and Rose Byrne who try to protect the people and escort them out. Eventually the group is literally chased out of the city by an explosion and into the outskirts while the city is being firebombed (and Robert Caryle-zombie avoids inceneration by ducking in an alleyway, whatever I don't care anymore).<br /><br />So Jermey Renner's token black friend lands in his helicoptor and says he's only taking his friend, not anyone else or else he'll get shot down. A bunch of infected show up that survived the fireblast and are coming towards the survivors (I wonder if the big loud helicoptor had anything to do with it) and in true action stupidity token uses his helicoptor propellers to slice up the horde, spraying blood all over his helicoptor. Yeah carrying a few kids on your helicoptor will get you shot down but infected blood painted all over your helicoptor won't. Again, the helicoptor couldn't carry the kids until one of them was infected, for sequel purposes defy consistency and logic. (P.S. interesting how Planet Terror and 28 Weeks Later came out in the same month and had the same stunt, anyone know which came up with the idea?)<br /><br />So the helicoptor leaves them and they're running away from even MORE remaining infected that survived firebombing and helicoptor slicing, and they run into the city, which is now being gassed (for all the military's thorough efforts, Robert Caryle-zombie can survive them all). So the survivors minus Jeremy Renner are driving through desolate London when an attack helicoptor comes, sees a car driving, and starts blasting at it with miniguns. Not only are they taking 'Code Red' to laughable extremes, but how do those fools in the helicoptor miss a lone vechicle, it's like shooting at that car for about a minute or two and can't hit the damn thing.<br /><br />So the car goes into the subway and there's only 1 zombie alive, of course it's Robert Caryle, for DRAMA! So he offs Rose Byrne in a shot that Quarantine later ripped off without shame then bites Muggleton Poots or something until Imogen Toots through tears shoots him off with loud soap-opera music blaring to remind you that this is really a family drama. So now Poots (or was it Toots?) is dormantly infected, and so NOW the helicoptor pilot will take them up, and there's no apparent sign that token black pilot will get shot down. Hm.<br /><br />So 28 Weeks Later was entertaining and had high ambitions, the acting was good and the whole story was pretty interesting, it just had so many plot holes glaring me in the face that I couldn't come to enjoy it as much as 28 Days Later. Sure Days had some plot holes too, but they were fewer and far between and were more ambigious instead of just plain vanilla stupid like the holes in Weeks. So some great scenes that are few and far inbetween don't make up for an overall jarring and bumpy experience of a movie. If you must watch this open a few beers first so you don't have to think very much about all the dumb crap this movie tries to get away with.</p></body></html>

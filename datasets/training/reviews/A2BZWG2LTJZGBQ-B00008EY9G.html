<meta name="summary" content="I left the theater speechless"></head><body><p>I think there are two basic types of movie watchers.  The first goes into each film trying to figure it out.  That's the whole goal.  If they succeed, then the movie is "predictable" and "stupid".  If not, then the "plot made no sense" or "whole thing was just so boring" and other comments.  No way to win.<p>The second type of movie watcher sees the film to enjoy the movie and does not make guessing the twists or the endings the whole goal.  This is me.  Because of this, I was truly able to enjoy "Identity", especially when the story took its turn.  <p>You see, anyone remotely familiar with great stories in the last hundred years has heard of Agatha Christie's "And Then There Were None" where one by one people die at the hand of some unknown killer on site, since leaving the scene is impossible.  The killer must be one of them.  For the first hour, this appears to be a retread of this classic tale.<p>At this point in the movie, either you are in category 1 and you hate the film, or you are in category 2 and you love it because it will challenge you and it will hit you hard.  Even if you are able to see the surprise coming, you have to admit that looking through the story it does not cheat.  It stays faithful to the parameters it has set and that's all you can ask.<p>Yes, the acting is good and the screenplay is well executed and editing and all that, but this film does not depend on the actors.  It works well as fiction and I think you could have replaced the actors with other capable performers and not lost much.  Very few people I have spoken with have been real concerned with Cusack's or Liotta's performances.<p>I will admit that the very end seems a little tacked on.  Hollywood seems to have a formula they have to follow and one is an ending like this one.  It works, but it is unnecessary.  The movie actually twists twice and it does not have to.  <p>Just look at the comments throughout these reviews.  Most are either love or hate.  I think some people get mad when movies put one over on them... not me!  I'll be first in line to get the DVD when it comes out.  This is simply one of the most effective horror movies I have ever seen.  It's Hitchcock meets Christie meets Steven King.  I hope you enjoy it.</p></body></html>

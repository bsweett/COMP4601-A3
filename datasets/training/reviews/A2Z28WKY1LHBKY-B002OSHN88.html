<meta name="summary" content="Lime's Last Line"></head><body><p>There's only one thing wrong with this movie, and that's Harry Lime's famous line. I believe it was written by Orson Welles himself. Graham Greene would never have been so flip, nor would he have inserted such an empty wisecrack. The line should have been: "In Italy for thirty years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, bloodshed. They produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love, five hundred years of democracy and peace. And what did they produce  --- Albert Einstein. So long, Harry." Of course, it would have to have been said by Holly.<br /><br />The camera angles also seem to have been heavily influenced by Welles's Citizen Kane, but here they work much better, since they are mostly non-studio. After reading all the reviews, I'm amazed at how this picture divides opinion, and equally amazed by some of the remarks. I can't understand why Hitchcock keeps getting mentioned. This film is quite unlike anything by Hitchcock. Although I believe Greene and Hitchcock have the influence of the Roman Catholic church in common, which causes them both to be concerned with the question of guilt, Hitchcock is an out-and-out Freudian, which means he is not really interested in the morality of human motivation; whereas Greene doesn't appear to be a Freudian of any sort at all. His concern is with questions of good and evil: the choices facing humans when they are presented with a dilemma. What is right, and what is wrong. This film is superb in the way it presents these dilemmas. Cotten is absolutely ideal as the weak, undecided, ordinary man, fascinated by those who are more charismatic than himself, and stumbling in his attempts to discover the right decisions to make. James Stewart would have been nothing like as good. This film isn't about the Orson Welles character, it's about Holly Martin. Martin is himself the real third man, hovering between two extremes in a very grey area between black and white.<br /><br />The ending is exceptionally good, as the desirable woman walks straight past him, having come to her decision on purely emotional grounds, unaffected by the immorality, callousness or cynicism of the man she had committed herself to. Holly's feeble attempts to do the right thing leave him floundering. He would have done better, like everyone tells him, to fly straight back home and forget about the whole thing. After all, that's what most average Joes do: just ignore anything difficult or unpleasant, and look the other way. This is pure Graham Greene-land. It's not in any sense a thriller, or a suspense story, but an intellectual debate about right and wrong. Some of the comments by the reviewers on this site seem so mentally dense it makes one weep.<br /><br />Now that I've watched the really outstanding documentary on the second disc, with the commentary spoken by John Hurt --- a great actor --- I'm even more staggered by the out-and-out stupidity of some the site reviewers. This analysis of the film, and its making, shows up precisely what an intellectual jerk Selznick must have been, what a sucker-milking money-maker, just like Harry Lime himself, and how a huge percentage of Americans are simple-minded hicks, without the remotest conception of aesthetics, or the multi-layered meanings of Europe's two thousand years of history, culture and suffering.<br /><br />After watching Murnau's Faust, it becomes even clearer that, at the height of the ferris wheel, Welles has been cast as Satan tempting Everyman.</p></body></html>

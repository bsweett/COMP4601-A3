<meta name="summary" content="Good here, better bigger."></head><body><p>Even though I own this movie on DVD, I had to catch it on a special midnight screening last night so that I could finally see it in all it's big-screen, publicly squeamish glory.<br /><br />I'm not saying it needs it, but on the big screen this film is so much more obviously amazing.  The crazy angles and tracking shots are very involving and basically disallow the viewer from not getting trapped into its story.<br /><br />Especially nice about this movie is its fun.  The makers obviously never wanted to let up, so it just delves right in and never stops.  Not only does it not matter that a lot of the events in this film are unexplained, most of the time nobody thinks even to point that out.  The movie is so true to it's own desire to just immerse and never come out for breath that it is wonderfully self-secure.  It only gives a few tidbits of why things are happening to give the audience some foundation so as not to just float away in a random haze of chaos.<br /><br />On a smaller screen, the effects don't seem very special, but on a wide-screen, they are quite good and still very fun.  The entire movie is by no means the greatest horror film in existence, but everything in it is good and just as good as it needs to be.<br /><br />I'd say all horror fans should see it, but especially if there's a showing in an independant theatre nearby.  Then buy the DVD anyways because how else can you say you own a film where a woman gets raped by a tree?<br /><br />--PolarisDiB</p></body></html>

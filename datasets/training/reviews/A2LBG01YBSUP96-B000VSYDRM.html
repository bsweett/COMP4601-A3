<meta name="summary" content="very original,but the ending stinks"></head><body><p>this is one of the more creative movies ive seen in a while.baby born under a table at a fish market where his uncaring mother was working.even worse,she hoped he died (theres more to this but youll have to watch it for yourself).<br /><br />baby grows up and his life got no easier.his only skill;extraordinary sense of smell.i mean,he can smell the exact ingredients of perfume and from great distances.a smell,or,to be more exact,a certain fragrance,is now his obsession.<br /><br />he,jean baptise,is given apprenticeship at a famed perfumers shop (d hoffman).here jb tries to hone his gift/curse.this is also where the killing takes off.his need to kill is due to his need for the perfect scent.<br /><br />this is very well done and didnt go for the jack the ripper kind of violence.one may actually feel sympathy for jean baptiste for he doesnt kill out of hatred,but out of necessity.<br /><br />as for the ending...........SPOILER ALERT !!!!!!  STOP READING !!!!!!<br /><br />i would have accpeted the mass orgie.but only as a figment of jb imagination as hes being punished.how i would have done it was have jb led to the cross where the torture would take place.then,in slow motion/dreamlike mode,jb would imagine his scent being so wonderful no one could resist.but in the real world,we see the punishment being doled out in unrelenting cruelty (picture braveheart's ending to some extent).<br /><br />to make the 1st nonsensical part of the ending even worse,jb walks away,goes back to where he was born,bathes himself in his love potion,gets mobbed and .....evaporates ?!?!?!?!? he literally ceased to exist.its a shame it ended on such a weak note,imho.</p></body></html>

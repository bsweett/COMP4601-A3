<meta name="summary" content="Like A Senior Thesis"></head><body><p>Some of these reviewers have panned this movie as a misuse of great acting talent.  Fans of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, particularly, assert that their boys were underserved by this film.<br /><br />If you've never seen this movie before, here's a suggestion.  Look at it as sort of a senior thesis in filmmaking.  It's chock-full of original, quirky ideas, many of which are calculated to get people mad.  This is the concept meant by the word "sophomoric."<br /><br />Two angels that have lost favor find a technical loophole with dogma which will allow them back into heaven.  So, it's a "quest" movie where the questors are fallen angels, and their quest lacks legitimacy.  As written, the angels have become imps in the classical sense:  they have a mean-spirited, mischievous sense of humor.<br /><br />People object to many things here, but perhaps one of the things that most sticks in the throat is that Jay and Silent Bob, two characters that define the terms "slacker" and "low-life," end up becoming the instrumentalities that God uses to restore balance to the universe.  But that notion has plenty of precedent in the New Testament anyway.  Read it some time...<br /><br />Anyway, taken as a senior thesis, this is actually a satisfying movie.  As a catalyst for talking about the traditions of the Catholic Church, even, it serves a halfway decent purpose.<br /><br />And, if you're looking for a more suitable vehicle for Ben Affleck, try "Pearl Harbor."</p></body></html>

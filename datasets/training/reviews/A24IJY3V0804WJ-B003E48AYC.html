<meta name="summary" content="Reimagining a classic"></head><body><p>I read in an interview that Tim Burton was not pleased with the original Alice in Wonderland book as he never felt a connection with the characters. So with this movie he sets out a clever reimagining of the classic. Alice is shown as a complete opposite of the expectations of women of that period. The book is familiar to most of us however the retelling is what drew me to this movie. Tim Burton does not disappoint in bringing the book to life with vivid scenery and colorful landscapes with colors out of this world with the help of amazing makeup and costumes. I enjoyed this movie for these features and gave it three stars. 10/16/10</p></body></html>

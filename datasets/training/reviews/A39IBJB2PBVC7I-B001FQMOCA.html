<meta name="summary" content="Because You Whine, I Cross The Line"></head><body><p>Walk The Line is a well crafted movie featuring exceptional performances.  It's long, and there are whole sections where little seems to be happening, (or worse, the same things seem to be happening over and over), but it's worth it for two short scenes.<br /><br />The first is when Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) cleans up his act (for the moment) and walks onto the Folsom Prison stage a fully formed star.  At that moment he is in complete command of his technical abilities and sense of self.  He is contrite and cocky, even feisty, and gives his audience exactly what they want and need.<br /><br />The other is almost antithetical.  June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) is alone on stage, bathed in a blue spotlight.  She is performing Wildwood Flower, accompanying herself on autoharp.  Her tone is clean and open, this is a woman who grew up in music, the stage is where she feels most comfortable.  She doesn't dazzle, she merely gives.  Wildwood Flower is an example of purely beautiful Appalachian folk music, a far cry from the ersatz Elvis eyewash forming the foundation of Cash's early career.<br /><br />Though strong, the film has major flaws.  For one, country music itself is almost a total write-off, it's borderline unlistenable.  Next, Cash was never much of a singer, which explains his tuneless mumbling.  The Man In Black was also just an average guitarist, although he did pen a few catchy songs.  June Carter, by contrast, was a treasure and Reese Witherspoon's performance is nothing short of amazing.  Witherspoon captures all of Carter's ebullience, energy, and sheer charm, without ever seeming artificial.  This raises another point.<br /><br />Lately it's fashionable for actors playing musicians to do their own singing, presumably in an attempt to lend authenticity.  This charmingly idiotic conceit is exclusively predicated on thespian vanity.  (Does James Brown perform Shakespeare In The Park?  Think about it.)  Film is artifice, acting is artifice, why intersperse documentation?  In fact, having Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon lip-synching would be more, not less, authentic.<br /><br />Another drawback is that the story, however accurate, is a weather beaten cliche.  A tormented kid of humble means and limited emotional resources fails to navigate the corridors of fame successfully, falls, and gradually pulls himself out of the gutter a sadder but wiser man.  It's beyond tired, it's plug-and-play.  Of course, the Johnny Cash story is already well known so this paint-by-numbers exercise is even less surprising than usual.<br /><br />Biopics leverage pre-existing fame and convert it to income, after all, the advance work is done.  Since there are no surprises to be had, the only question is - is WTL well done?  Fortunately, the answer is yes.  Phoenix and Witherspoon both dazzle.  Had Cash been more than a two-chord picker boasting a deep baritone and a vocal range almost approaching one full octave, had he, for example, been an actual artist with something worthwhile to say and an interesting way of saying it, it would be easier to care about his simplistic obsession with self-destruction.</p></body></html>

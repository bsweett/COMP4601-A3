<meta name="summary" content="Not magical in the slightest"></head><body><p>I've been interested in the legend of King Arthur for a while, and although it doesn't quite come near my obsession with the Titanic, it still rouses my curiosity every so often. Hence the fact I've been dying to see this movie since it came out, but decided to wait for the director's cut DVD, so I could see the gorier version that wasn't shown in the cinemas. I got it for my Christmas, along with the book! Woohoo!<br /><br />I've seen a few of the Arthur movies made - Excalibur (which I barely made it through), Merlin (TV movie with Sam Niall), and Mists Of Avalon. The last two were excellent, and I must admit, I was hoping for something as magical as they were both. I was bitterly disappointed when this didn't come anywhere close to magical, and instead, seemed intent on ripping off both Braveheart & Lord Of The Rings (according to my Dad - I still have no desire to see these movies).<br /><br />The characters are indistinguishable from each other in this - if I didn't like a certain Welshman Ioan Gruffud (can't pronounce his name however), playing Lancelot, then I'd be hard-pressed to tell the difference between him & Clive Owen, who played Arthur. The rest of the characters were barely given a proper introduction, and throughout most of the movie, I was lost as to why these people with long hair wanted Arthur's, and his men's, blood on their hands. Merlin barely made an appearance, he was referenced once, and that was it. Guinevere, played by a monotone and bored sounding Keira Knightley, didn't appear until halfway through the movie, and then barely appeared there after. Although they made sure they got shots of her in what can only be described, as a couple of bits of sticky tape for an outfit - at least she doesn't have enough to burst out of it. The `romance' between her & Lancelot was little more than a teaser, and not at all like the other movies, where she marries Arthur & then has an affair, or they have a threesome. And I did not think it was the done thing in those days for any physical contact outside of marriage. Slow down girl!<br /><br />Another thing I did NOT understand was the fact that Jerry Bruckheimer's name is splashed everywhere to do with this movie, which led me to think he actually directed it. But a guy called Antoine Fuqua, actually directed it. Bruckheimer just threw a pile of money at it, in order to get it made. I still don't see why his name is everything. Poor Fuqua isn't getting much recognition for his work. Michael Bay was originally supposed to direct, and with him, it was in development for five years. He left due to budget concerns. (I'll probably get an in-depth lecture about this entire paragraph on the ins & outs of directors, producers, and everyone inbetween that.)<br /><br />One section of the movie I did enjoy immensely was Arthur & his men pitted against the Saxons - at least I think that's who they were. They were about to fight on top of a frozen lake, which proceeded to crack beneath their combined weight, and the camera actually films beneath the ice - although it's probably very clever camera/computer trickery. This scene is quite close to being magical, but not enough.<br /><br />Most of the characters differ slightly to what I've seen them portrayed in other movies. Guinevere is normally a weak little girl, who'll kick off her knickers at any sign of a guy's attention, even if she bound in marriage to another guy, but in this, Keira Knightley played a snarling warrior, who's an expert archer. Clive Owen did not have the charisma to play Arthur, even though in other movies, he's basically a weakling, being pushed by the women around him or having to consult Merlin before he did anything. His eyes, although dark, were not in the least bit sexy, and were almost dead. And Lancelot seemed to be devoted to Arthur until the end - no running off with the girl there!<br /><br />Another quibble about the number of knights - didn't the legend state that there were twelve knights? There were only seven in this, and only four left by the end of the movie.<br /><br />At the start of this movie, it's described as being the `real' story of King Arthur, which was set many years before the fairytale/legend came about. Frankly, despite the fact I'll probably watch it again at some point, I'll be sticking to the fairytale/legend from now on. It's never a good thing when you see the `real' story, after you've been brought up on/told about the fairytale. Would you like to see the film version of Hansel & Gretel? They didn't get eaten up by a old woman/witch/hag in a house made of sweets - they ran off, got married & had babies together. Or Cinderella didn't marry the prince. Instead she became a businesswoman, and never let another man touch her again. (OK, I went a bit mad there - but I think I know what I'm talking about.)</p></body></html>

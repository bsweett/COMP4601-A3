<meta name="summary" content="Few Better Than Rodriguez"></head><body><p>When Robert Rodriguez makes a movie like this, Sin City or Desperado, you know you are in for something cool. Always looking for a new place to stick a gun, he is one of the few directors who can grab a genre and re-energize it; This movie is just fun all around; I found it much more entertaining than Deathproof(too much talking for me...), and seemed to capture that style, camp, and look of the 70's exploitation movie just a little better. I loved alot in Deathproof, but felt it could have lost a little more in the editing room, made it a little tighter... Rodriguez keeps the quirky talk and moves us right along with it; Way over the top, ultra violent, and some things you may not have seen in a movie before(everyone knows about the machinegun leg by now, but I think it's a first!). Well acted, shot, scored, and written. You could tell this was Robert's 'baby'.</p></body></html>

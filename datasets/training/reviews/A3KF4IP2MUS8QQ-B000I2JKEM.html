<meta name="summary" content="A dark masterpiece of Burton's unique imagination"></head><body><p>Wouldn't it have been great to have been buddies with Tim Burton as a child?  He must have been the coolest cat around, a genius with an imaginatively poetic attraction to the darker side of things.  As a filmmaker, Burton's sort of an enigma to me.  Just look at Corpse Bride.  Apart from weird folks like myself, I don't see much of a target audience for this film.  Children may well find the start of the film a little tedious, since nothing big happens for a while, and both the story and music seem to play more for adults.  Sure, kids will find their fair share of laughs in the film and will surely enjoy the uniquely odd representations of Burton's characters, but issues of love, marriage, and death aren't exactly popular topics among the younger generation - and, truth be told, there's an element of sadness in the whole story, especially the ending.  Yet Corpse Bride is an animated film, and animated films aren't known, as a general rule, for packing in adult crowds at the movie theater.  Despite the absence of any obvious target audience, though, the film garnered many favorable reviews and more than paid for itself at the box office alone.  I don't think there's another filmmaker out there that could do what Tim Burton does and be so extraordinarily successful at it.<br /><br />I'm not sure it will be the very first word, but "unique" should certainly appear somewhere on Burton's future tombstone.  While many a filmmaker never develops a style of his/her own, Burton is all but bursting with style.  I love the Gothic, decidedly odd-shaped inhabitants of this fictional world - and I find it very interesting that he imparts color and life only to the world below, juxtaposing this with the dreary, colorless greys of life among the living.  The wonders of stop-motion animation apparently know no bounds, and it's great to see a famous filmmaker not only continuing in the grand tradition but raising the bar for future efforts of a similar kind.<br /><br />Boy meets girl.  Boy accidentally marries a corpse, etc.  Not your typical story, is it?  Poor shy, clumsy Victor (Johnny Depp); one day, he could probably count the number of women he's spoken to on one hand, then the next day, he's fallen in love with one girl - Victoria (Emily Watson), the girl his parents arranged for him to marry - and found himself betrothed to another, one who happens to be quite dead.  Really, though, I thought everyone knew better than to place a wedding ring on any inanimate object - that's just asking for trouble.  Victor does it while he's practicing his wedding vows, never realizing that he is speaking to and placing the ring on the finger of a corpse bride rather than a dead branch.  Poor Emily (Helena Bonham Carter), who was murdered right before her own wedding, has waited years for her true love to come and rescue her from her final resting place in the woods.  Suddenly finding her dream come true, she pops up and immediately absconds with her new "husband" to her own home in the lower world.  Naturally, Victor is more than anxious to leave the company of the lively but obviously very dead inhabitants of Emily's world and return to the world above - and to Victoria.  The viewer is necessarily torn by everything that happens from here on out.  On the one hand, there's sweet Victoria yearning for Victor to return and marry her; on the other hand, there's Emily, who loves Victor and truly deserves to be happy after her truly sad travails before death.  It's a harder choice than you might think, especially since Emily is - dare I say it - pretty hot for a corpse.<br /><br />Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is, to me, a rather sad movie.  It will make you laugh, but it won't leave you laughing.  In any lovers' triangle, one of the three parties necessarily ends up the loser, and you will find no exception to this rule here.  The story plays out quite well indeed, but there's no getting away from the sense of melancholy inherent in the ending.  The only issue I have with this rather remarkably impressive film, though, is its running time.  Not counting the credits, you're looking at about 71 minutes - and it felt even shorter than that.  I would gladly have spent much more time in this literally jaw-dropping (watch for it), surreal, visually incredible world of Burton's imagination.</p></body></html>

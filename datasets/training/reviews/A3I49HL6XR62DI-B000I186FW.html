Ever think about conspiracy theories? Ever wonder if bird flu is for real? Ever wonder if the media are in collusion with the government to distract the public from really important issues? Ever wonder what the difference between a terrorist and a freedom fighter is? Ever wonder where governmental protection stops and totalitarianism begins? Ever think about what it would feel like not to live in fear? This film is highly recommended. It is an allegory of our times and our potentially dangerous future. YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM. Remember, remember the fifth of November . . .</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Long But Not Terrible"></head><body><p>I personally have not ever read the comics and didn't even know it was based on a comic-we went mostly because the special effects looked awesome.  I didn't think it was a terrible movie; a quite long movie I will say it was.  Almost 2 hours is quite long.  I personally thought Keanu was okay as an actor in it.  I didn't like the Gabriel role or the person who played Satan.  I LOVED that fact that once again Gavin Rossdale was in a movie-and he pulled off his part well to but seemed to be stretching also.  It just felt forced acting from ALL the actors and actresses.  But, the plot was good and the special effects rocked!  So I look over the acting.  I personally wonder if many people don't like the movie because it relies heavily on religion and you may start to debate your own faith?!  But, I found that part interesting and part of the suspense and sort of a horror factor came from the religion role.  It was a heck of a lot scarier than Bogeyman and Hide and Seek; for the fact that it was better at putting you in the movie and also catching you off guard more often.  Personally I think this movie is worth catching.  It isn't terrible but it feels super long-that is my biggest complaint.</p></body></html>

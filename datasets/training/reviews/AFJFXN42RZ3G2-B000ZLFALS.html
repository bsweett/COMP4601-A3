Taymor visually displays the tumultuous 1960s, and uses the most popular and influential music of The Beatles, which brought the generation together. Besides the music, the story line and the very artistic images make the film, which conveys the confusion, revolution, and love that was generated by one of the most misunderstood generation.<br /><br />The interesting aspect about the film is that the six major characters possess names from Beatles songs. First, there is Jude ("Hey Jude") from Liverpool, England, who takes a respite from his job as a ship dockworker, and heads for New York City to find his long-lost father who works as a janitor at Princeton University. Second, there is Lucy ("Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"), who waits for her high school sweetheart who is fighting in Vietnam. Third, there is Max ("Maxwell's Silver Hammer"), Lucy's brother, a Princeton dropout, who moves to Greenwich Village and becomes a taxi-driver, but is later drafted into the war. Fourth and fifth, Sadie ("Sexy Sadie")and Jo-Jo ("Get Back"), the musicians in the film who are a cross between Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix, but act more like Ike and Tina Turner. Sixth, Prudence ("Dear Prudence"), the lesbian-cheerleader from the Midwest, drifts in and out of the picture.<br /><br />There is plenty of symbolism in the film that crosses a variety of genres, which include music, art, and politics.  Foremost, the images in the film represent the events that shaped the Sixties, such as the Anti-war movement, Civil Rights Movement, Vietnam War, hallucinogenic drugs, and free love. And the highlights of the film is the appearance of Joe Cocker and his rendition of "Come Together," and U2's Bono who plays Dr. Robert and sings "I Am The Walrus," (he almost looks a little like Dennis Hopper's character in EASY RIDER).<br /><br />Overall, ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is a no nonsense entertaining film that relives one of the most powerful periods in American history. At times, the images of yesterday almost resonate an ironic present.</p></body></html>

Well, the movie only came out on August 31st of this year, which I thought was two months early for this particular film, but apparently that was so they could still get the DVD out in time for it to be an ironic if not perverse stocking stuffer (the movie was still in theaters at the start of December).  Marketing strategy aside, it should be made clear that this film is actually more than a remake of John Carpenter's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00104AL5Y">original</a>.  The story of how young Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch) became a killer as a little kid is now the entire first act of the film and not simply the prologue, and in Zombie's revisions it is made clear why Michael picked up that big knife and started slicing and dicing.  Bullied at school, abused at home by his wicked stepfather (William Forsythe), and saddled with a stripper for a mom (Sheri Moon Zombie), Michael has more than his fair share of issues.<br /><br />We also get to see some of Michael's sessions with Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) and what happened to make Michael's baby sister an orphan.  This reflects the other significant difference between this and the original, which is that this time around we know that Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) is Michael's sister.  Actually, in the final analysis this movie covers what happens in the original and what happens in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LC4Q">sequel</a> (and if you want to stretch things Michael's fascinating with masks could be a wink and a nod to the atrocious "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AOX09">Halloween III - Season Of The Witch</a>").  Not that Laurie ever makes it to the hospital, but in the end it come to the siblings.  That sounds like a lot, to condense two movies and add a whole new first act, but once Zombie gets to Halloween present he concentrates on hitting the highlights from the original and throwing in plenty of echoes from the originals: "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009NHC0">The Thing from Another World</a>" is still playing on the television and "Mr. Sandman" is still being sung.<br /><br />Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at Zombie's strategy in making this film.  On the one hand he sticks to the unforgettable music of Carpenter's original score, but on the other he avoids going head to head with that movie's iconic scene when Laurie finds the tableau display of Annie's corpse.  I also have to say there was a lot less blood and gore than I would have suspected given Zombie's previous cinematic efforts (e.g., "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AXWHSA">The Devil's Rejects</a>"), but there is a concerted effort here to be more in the style of the original and it is nice to be reminded that a good door slam can be more terrorizing that a geyser of blood.  It is for that slight change in sensibilities, plus all the nifty DVD extras, that lead me to round up on this one.  It goes without saying that the remake does not surpass the original--which stands out in our memories because for most of us it was the first time we saw the killer keep getting up again and again--but no one ever thinks that is going to be the case, so when that turns out to be the case it is not a surprise.  Just do not be surprised when you finish watch this remake that you do not feel the urge to go back and enjoy the original yet again.</p></body></html>

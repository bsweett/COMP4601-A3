Granted, it is a Hollywood interpretation of the famous epic and is, therefore, inaccurate.  The screenwriters, however, clearly love Homer's tale and try to do justice to it.  They've just tried to tweak it a little.<br /><br />We see remorseless Agammemnon sacrifice his only daughter so that favorable winds will blow for the Greek fleet.  We see near-immortal Achilles playing with his women prior to deadly battle.  Actually this scene doesn't accord with the Iliad.  Achilles, who has been warned of his death at Troy, has dressed up like a woman and is hiding with them.<br /><br />We see Paris and Helen too weak to subdue their fatal desire.  We see Hector and old Priam--for reasons we never completely understand--refuse to discipline the wayward couple and return fair Helen to her husband.<br />We see the mechanical Achilles slaughter ranks of his enemies.<br /><br />Still, the story does diverge from the Iliad.  There is a duel between Helen's husband, Menelaus, and Paris.  Menelaus proves victorious but, when he goes to kill Paris, Hector intervenes and slays the cuckolded man.  Not true.  In the story Paris is whisked away to the arms of Helen by the Goddess Aphrodite.  Menelaus lives to reclaim his wife after the fall of the doomed city.<br /><br />The other, more fundamental change the scriptors made, was to minimize the supernatural component of the story.  Most of the events have natural explanations whereas, in the Iliad, events are dictated by bickering Gods.<br /><br />No matter.  Hector, both in the movie and in the Iliad, is sympathetic as the doomed hero fighting for his city.  He's a mighty warrior but he must fight against the Achilles demi-god.  He almost prevails but, in the end, there is no escaping death at Achilles' hand.  It is, after all, fate.<br /><br />I love the story so I liked the movie.  We are witness to events 3,200 years ago still we take sides and--even though we know what the outcome must be--we hope things will turn out differently.  It's remarkable in its own way.  Since the fall of Troy countless cities and civilizations have fallen but Homer's tragic tale makes us weep.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God" on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico.</p></body></html>

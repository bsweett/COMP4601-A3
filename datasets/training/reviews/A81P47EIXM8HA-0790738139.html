<meta name="summary" content="NEW VERSION DVD review...."></head><body><p>Rather than review this amazing modern Noir...I just want to say..BUY this new version...it looks fabulous and the bonus features are  PLENTIFUL and very meaty with content and the good  news is they ALSO have brought over the features from the first release allowing all of us to dump that one and that isn't always the case.  They also have a nearly 1  hr  TV  movie/pilot called LA CONFIDENTIAL starring Keifer Sutherland which is fun.  There is also a bonus CD disc of music which is icing on the cake.  I just spent a few hours watching all the bonus features and will absolutely watch them again ( a rarity) and as I  said..the movie never  looked better..I've only checked out a bit of the commentary which has a staggering  number of contributors and should make another viewing  of the movie with it running a fun trip indeed.  WB  does  it well when they re-issue and not just with the sexy new cover image  ..this baby got a complete overhaul...<br /><br />enjoy!</p></body></html>

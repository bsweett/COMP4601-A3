<meta name="summary" content="Fashionably Engaging"></head><body><p>Cute story about a young college graduate seeking to become a journalist and takes a job working for a fashion magazine under Miranda Priestly, the demanding high-powered executive whose connections extend across the globe.<br /><br />Although the movie center's wound Anne Hathaway's character, Meryl Streep steals the show.  Her represntation of the dragon lady boss was dead on!  Not the high-octane-greedy-loud-mouthed CEO so typical of Hollywood films, but a very realistic view of Bosses at the top and the manner in which their subordinates react to meet their demands. She's controlled, soft spoken, unyielding and very firm...and she knows the business better than anyone else.  It's funny to watch people scramble to meet her impossible demands.<br /><br />Amazing clothes!  I have a new appreciation for the fashion industry.  I didn't realize so much went into it. Enjoyable chick flick with amazing couture.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A fun romp, but not up to usual A or P standards"></head><body><p>What I did NOT like:<br /><br />1. The heroine was not strong enough to convince me she was what she was supposed to be.  I did not believe for a minute that she had the skill to lead that group.<br /><br />2.  There were too many stories going on in the beginning causing the viewer to be too distracted to get into what was happening.<br /><br />3.  Not enough development in the middle of the movie, it just whams right into "my enemy's enemy is my friend" then ends.<br /><br />4.  Sliced and diced apparently.  When will the money-men stop trying to govern the art of film?  This movie should have been full of the same fright and gore that made Aliens & Predator II so great.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />1.  The plot overall was a good one.<br /><br />2.  The team members<br /><br />3.  The scenery and special effects.<br /><br />4.  Lance H. is always great to watch, died too soon.<br /><br />5.  The archeologist was great, he died too soon though.</p></body></html>

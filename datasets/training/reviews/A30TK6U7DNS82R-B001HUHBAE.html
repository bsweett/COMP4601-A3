<meta name="summary" content="An American Tale"></head><body><p>First of all, I loved the multimillion dollar recreation of San Francisco in its days of hippie glory in the 1960s and 1970s.  As though to show time changing, Fincher calls in all his CGI friends to building the Transamerica Pyramid (600 Montgomery Street) before our eyes, and eventually leaves it as another tall, lit-up silhouette on the famous horizon.  Better than anything else, the Pyramid shows the difference between the new and the old city.<br /><br />Anthony Edwards makes an amazing return (and his hair does too) playing Bill Armstrong, the lead detective on the case and the partner of Dave Toschi, an outspoken Italian-American cop played in colorful, John-Garfield-in-Tortilla-Flat style by Mark Ruffalo.  I nearly didn't recognize Ruffalo without Reese Witherspoon or Jennifer Garner playing opposite him, but here he is as the man's man many think that Dirty Harry Callahan was based on, and he's almost convincing.  As a pas de trois between three fabulously talented male stars (Ruffalo, Jake Gyllenhall, and Robert Downey Jr.) ZODIAC is never boring, and whenever Anthony Edwards comes on screen the movie rises up another notch.<br /><br />Maybe the women don't do so well, though Clea Duvall is striking as the jailbird sister of one of the very first Zodiac victims.  But whoever is playing Ruffalo's wife has almost nothing to do except cast knowing silhouettes, and Chloe Sevigny, as the love interest for Robert Downy Jr's character, looks sour throughout, like someone was feeding her lemon flavored epsom salts through a tube.  Ciara Hughes makes an astounding screen debut as the mysterious Darlene Ferrin; you can believe that whoever committed the Zodiac murders knew her well and wanted to know her better.  I expect this beautiful young actress will have a great career in Hollywood, if she wants one.<br /><br />But basically you will want to know how creepy the show is--and the answer is plenty.  The movie begins with a radio segue, from Three Dog Night singing "Easy to be Hard" into the acid-rock freakout of John Paul Bonham, Alan Parker, Jimmy Page proto Led Zep of Donovan's "Hurdy Gurdy Man" as the suspense and the darkness ratchet up.  Putside the theater the marquee blinked on and off all evening, "WHY DID THE KILLER STOP KILLING?  IS HE STILL ALIVE?  COULD HE BE SITTING NEXT TO YOU?"  You didn't even want to look up to see who was anywhere in the rows around you.  If someone touched me I would scream.</p></body></html>

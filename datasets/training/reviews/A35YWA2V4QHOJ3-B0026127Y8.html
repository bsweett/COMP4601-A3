<meta name="summary" content="Shedding light on human trafficking"></head><body><p>I wish I could say that the plot of this film is contrived, unrealistic and would never actually happen to anyone in real-life. I really do wish that were the case.  Unfortunately, the opposite is true:  the plotline is about as accurate to what happens as a plotline can possibly be.  It sheds a light on a crisis of growing proportion in the world, yet one that gets all too little exposure:  human trafficking.<br /><br />Bryan (Liam Neeson) is an ex CIA spook whose daughter is ambushed / kidnapped while on a trip to Paris.  Luckily for her (and unluckily for her captors!), his skills give him an unexpected advantage in tracking down the thugs who took her from him.  Bryan takes on the HT network with all the grace of a wrecking ball ramming into a 100 year old building!<br /><br />Kidnapping for ransom is something that tends to only happen to the wealthy.  After all, kidnappers who are after $$ have little incentive to kidnap people who are of a modest financial worth.  Human trafficking, on the other hand, is an entirely different animal.  It can happen to anyone, anytime, as selling the person to a 3rd party is the objective, rather than selling the individual back to their family / friends.<br /><br />For this reason, this movie is a must-see as it sheds a much needed light on an all too frequent egregious practice.  It points out how the culprits operate in preying on "soft targets" who are far from home.  I can honestly say that viewing this movie could actually save lives in the "real" world in which we live.</p></body></html>

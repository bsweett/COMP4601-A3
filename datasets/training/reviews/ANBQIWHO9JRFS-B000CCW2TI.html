<meta name="summary" content="7/10. Very efficient thriller from Craven"></head><body><p>When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was stunned.  Was Wes Craven actually making a serious movie again? Apparently so.  However, I'm actually more forgiving of Craven's recent material than many  serious horror fans, as I actually liked all the 'Scream' movies (Even though they're about 1/10 as clever as they think they are), and found 'Cursed' to be passably entertaining, even if it was undeniably crappy.  Still, quasi-parodic horror films have never really been my bag, and I was definitely getting pretty tired of them, so it's nice to say one of the main purveyors of that sorta thing has gone straight, again.  Now, 'Red-Eye' isn't great, by any, means, but it's well made and well acted and tightly plotted and paced.  That's enough.<br /><br />As you probably already know, 'Red-Eye' is about Lisa Reisert, a hotel manager whose accosted on a plane by Jackson Rippner, a terrorist who wants her to move Homeland Security chief Keefe to a different room, presumably to allow him to be assassinated more readily.  If she doesn't do this, Jackson's cohorts will kill Lisa's father.  That's really about all there is to it, and it's, naturally, about Lisa's trying to prevent either deaths, and communicate her situation to others etc.  As noted before, this film is extremely efficient, as  it's about 75 minutes long if you don't include the credits  Most thriller or horror films have a bit of tiresome filler, somewhere, but 'Red-Eye' has virtually none, setting up the premise cleanly and giving us little information we don't need.  (For example, I like how we never learn who Jackson is and why he wants to kill Keefe, because, seriously, what difference does it make.)  Yet, it also avoids making Lisa a completely hollow, faceless character, unlike so many thriller or horror protagonists. (And she's certainly more likable than Neve Campbell or Christina Ricci were in Craven's last few films)<br /><br />The key to the film is Cillian Murphy's fantastic performance as Jackson.  I first saw Cillian in the brilliant movie '28 Days Later', where he was the protagonist, but he's moved onto villainy now.  He was pretty cool in 'Batman Begins', but he definitely takes it to the next level here, providing your classic menacing, but also charismatic and cool villain, all while still seeming to be essentially human. Of course, this leads to a minor caveat: Jackson is more charismatic and intriguing than Lisa, so I was generally rooting for him, making it somewhat frustrating when he's repeatedly foiled.<br /><br />Many have complained about the final act of this movie.  It takes place on the ground, at Lisa's home, and is fairly conventional.  Frankly, this  could easily pass for the  ending of a slasher film, where Lisa runs about the house and fights Jackson with various household items.  Again, I have seen this ending plenty of times before, but it still works. And, it is particularly well done, if for no other reason than the characters involved are better drawn and more interesting than they'd usually be. (And, for once the film has a reason why the protagonist wouldn't just run the hell outta there. i.e. if she does, her unconscious father will be left at Jackson's mercy)  And yeah, some of the events leading up to this are highly unlikely, but I've seen plausibility stretched plenty further a hundred times before.<br /><br />As usual, Craven's direction is nothing particularly flashy, just with lotsa tight, claustrophobic close-ups while they're on the the plane.  And, when they actually get back to the house, the scene is a lot more coherent than that sorta thing usually is.<br /><br />Lastly, the film has a few attempts at humor, most of which are extremely lame.  But again, there isn't much.<br /><br />Well that's it.  Not a brilliant film, but a sufficiently intriguing scenario and a great performance from Murphy.  Definitely worth checking out.<br /><br />Grade: B</p></body></html>

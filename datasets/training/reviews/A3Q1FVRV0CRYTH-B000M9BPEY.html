Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is dieing, and it's becuase of this, and because of this only, that his son William (Crudup) returns home with his pregnant wife (7 months to the day).  William has no relationship with his father, mostly because he has a misconstrued perseption of who his father really is.  All he has in memory of his father are the 'tall tales' he told him as a child.  Theres a fundamental truth that runs throughout this film, and it's that as children sometimes we take our parents for granted, we assume the worst, and worse yet, when we don't understand them or don't want to understand them we can write them off completly.  As William finds out through the recollection with his fathers stories, not everything he knows is a lie and his idea of who is father is couldn't be further from the truth.  Albert Finney gives a brilliant performance, as does Ewan McGregor who plays Edward in flashbacks of his younger years.  As much a fairytale this film may be, it's not that far from reality.  A sweet and endearing film, truly exrtaordinary!</p></body></html>

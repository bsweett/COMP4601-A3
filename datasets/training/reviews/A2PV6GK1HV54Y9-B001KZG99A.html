I was so bored and confused by this train wreck, I lost interest after 45 minutes of nothing. Robert Downey Jr. is horrible, he brings nothing exciting as Iron Man, highly over-rated actor. I give this film two stars thanks to Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard, wish they were in it more, they are the real deal. This is one action film I won't be seeing twice, yuck!</p></body></html>

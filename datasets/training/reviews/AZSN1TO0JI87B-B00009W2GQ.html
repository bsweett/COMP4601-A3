<meta name="summary" content="A revolution indeed."></head><body><p>I pretty much had my own idea of how this movie was going to be when I finished watching 'The Matrix: Reloaded' this past Spring. 'Reloaded' was somewhat of a disappointment for me, but it was neccessary. Since May I had it stuck in my head that 'Reloaded' was meant to bridge the gap between the first movie and the last movie, and that is was. Just as the first was a perfect, mysterious and fantasic beginning, 'Revolutions' is a no-holds barred, rollercoaster of action and emotion that closes out the trilogy with a bang. There is an entire action sequence that involves the machines penetrating Zion (the last living city, for those of you not in the know) where we are taken away from the main characters for about 40 minutes -- and you don't even notice! It is so easy to be engrossed in the action in this movie. All I ever heard was the hype about that darn freeway chase in 'Reloaded' that didn't seem to amount to anything. The action sequences in this movie are completely wild and over-the-top. And if action isn't what you are looking for, everything else is still here. The love story between Neo and Trinity is at it's strongest by this point, and of course with the way things work out, it would have to be. This movie also isn't as confusing as some would have you believe. As someone who hasn't submerged himself in all of the 'Matrix' multimedia that are said to be vital (video-games, cartoons, books, magazines, underwear, shot-glasses, vitamins...maybe I'm getting caried away), I walked away from this movie with a perfect understanding of the series as a whole and overall, I loved every minute of this movie. As said before, 'Reloaded' may have been a bore, but it made this movie possible. Don't let that disappointment (I know a lot of people were) damper your mood for seeing this movie. 'Revolutions' is a cinematic milestone. A must-see for anyone with even a casual interest in the 'Matrix' world.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Probably Should Not Have Split Year 7 into Two Films, but Entertaining Nonetheless."></head><body><p>The producers of the Harry Potter film franchise seem to have given up on using a different director with his or her unique style for every episode. "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1" is the third Harry Potter film directed by David Yates, whose previous work was mostly in British television. Yates seems to have been charged with directing the young wizard's darker years. J.K. Rowling's tome of Year 7 would have benefited from much tighter editing, but, unlike the previous two volumes, the filmmakers did not decide to correct this flaw for the silver screen. "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" is being presented as two installments on film. This is its only serious flaw. It could, or should, have skipped some of the wizard trio's camping adventures to create one, more focused three-hour film.<br /><br />The film begins on a dark note, literally. The Minister of Magic (Bill Nighy) announces, "These are dark times," and the headlines of The Daily Prophet scream, "Dark Mark Sparks Panic." Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) erases herself from her parents' memories, and The Order of the Phoenix prepares to escort Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) to a safe house under deep cover. But Prof. Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) betrays their plans to Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). Even the rare festivities of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding are interrupted by the death of the Minster of Magic and an attack of Death Eaters. Harry, Hermione, and Ron (Rupert Grint) are forced to flee. The only way to save the world from Voldemort's wrath is to find and destroy the remaining horcruxes that preserve his soul.<br /><br />There is an oddity in the tone of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows". It gives the impression that all of the necessary information won't fit in the film, yet there is a lot of storyline that could have been cut out to make the film stronger. Too much included, while at the same time not enough is explained. True to the book, however, the film does not shy away from the realities of a fanatically oppressive faction coming to power in the wizarding world: persecution, torture, and death. And a lot of dark imagery. This might be too frightening for Harry Potter's youngest fans. The level of mayhem probably qualifies it as an action movie. The film is generally entertaining, if meandering in parts. I found the animation that illustrates the pivotal "Tale of the Three Brothers", as found in "The Tales of Beedle the Bard", particularly effective.</p></body></html>

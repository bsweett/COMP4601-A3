We then have just a glimmer of hope that they won't have to leave. (If they can find an old pirate's treasure.) Now what is interesting here is that the hope revolves around a willingness to believe again as a child.<br /><br />Now what is interesting here is that the 4 young friends set off on this journey together, and gradually, Sean Astin's older brother, his possible girl friend, and her friend join the party. (The party started with 4 young children, and 3 older people ended up joining the party.)<br /><br />They go through an interesting series of caves filled with traps in hopes of saving their homes. What is especially interesting here is that no one is there without a purpose. (Corey Feldman knows Spanish and can read the map; Data has some gadgets that may prove useful; Andy can play the keyboard at a crucial time; Brandon is a little older, so he may be acquainted with some dangers the younger crew is not ready for, etc.<br /><br />Of course, we can't have it that easy. They are later persued by 3 The Fratellis who are very bad. But they carry a charm that makes them likable despite their crimes.  A signature moment is when one of the Fratellis complains that his mother always liked the other son better, and then she slaps him and says: "That's right."<br /><br />An especially funny moment with the Fratellis is when they want their prisoner Chunk to tell them EVERYTHING about the hidden treasure, but he takes it literally, and tells them every bad thing he ever did. And one of them gets interested in Chunk's confessions and responds: "I'm starting to like this kid."<br /><br />While the movie may seem simple, it is never boring. And the delightful interaction of the characters who aren't exactly experts, but who all have something to contribute to this journey may very well thrust this movie into the classics.<br /><br />It is emotionally enduring; funny; suspenseful; and full of adventure. Why? Because it's "The Goonies!"</p></body></html>

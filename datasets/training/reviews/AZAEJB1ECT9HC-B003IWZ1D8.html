<meta name="summary" content="What More Can One Say About Psycho?"></head><body><p>After all these years, what more can one say about Psycho?  It is simply the scariest movie ever made.  I saw it in the movies when I was ten years old and now, 50 years later, it is still terrifying.  I previously bought it on DVD.  However, now with the 5.1 sound and improved blu-ray picture, I've purchased it again.  And it was worth the price.  The picture is great and the 5.1 audio tremendous.  You can really hear that water coming down during the shower sequence and the rainstorm that brings Janet Leigh to the Bates Motel.  There are numerous special features including a long Making of Psycho retrospective (on the DVD as well. )  There are two new extras: a short entitled "In the Master's Shadow: Hitchcock's Legacy."  This is excellent.  There is also a special feature on the creation of the 5.1 sound heard on this blu-ray.  I also listened to the audio commentary by Stephen Rubello, author of "Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho."  The commentary is excellent.  It is such a pleasure to hear an audio commentary by someone who knows what they are talking about.  I particularly enjoyed his little anecdote about how overjoyed Hitchcock was with the performance of Simon Oakland as the Psychiatrist who explains what has been happening, near the end of the film.  I thought Oakland was great and have always enjoyed that scene.  Apparently Hitchcock got up from his chair after the sequence was completed and shook Oakland's hand, telling him that he had saved his (Hitchcock's) film.  I always find anecdotes like that interesting.<br />If you have never purchased Psycho before or never seen it (if thats possible,) then this blu-ray version is the one to get.  It is one of the most famous, frequently discussed and debated and most freightening films ever made.  It still holds up today and will probably hold up forever.  I heartily recommend it.  And remember to watch it with the lights out.</p></body></html>

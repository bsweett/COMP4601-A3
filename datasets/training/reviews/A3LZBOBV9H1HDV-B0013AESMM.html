The story by Roderick Taylor & Bruce A. Taylor and the screenplay by both Taylors & Cynthia Mort is excellent! The music by Dario Marianelli (who also did the music to the upcoming "Atonement" (2007) is excellent! The cinematography by Philippe Rousselot (who also did the cinematography to the upcoming "Lions For Lambs" (2007) & "Interview With The Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles") is excellent! The film editing by Tony Lawson (who also been working with Jordan since "Michael Collins") is great. The casting by Laura Rosenthal (who also did the casting to the upcoming "I'm Not There" (2007) is excellent! The production design by Kristi Zea (who also did the production design to "The Departed" (2006) & "The Silence Of The Lambs" (1991), which also starred Foster) is excellent! The art direction by Robert Guerra (who also did the art direction to "The Good Shepherd" (2006) is excellent!

<meta name="summary" content="Hard Candy"></head><body><p>A relevant film which looks at the darker side of internet chat room dating. An older man with a strong interest in teenage women finally hets his just-desserts when he messes with the wrong girl. Sure, alot of it is not convincing especially when the girl is far too mature for her years, but the film still works. It has a strong message and that is what is important.  Excellent performances by Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page. It's not a film I would watch again, but it definitely had us glued to the screen for the duration of the film. Well done!</p></body></html>

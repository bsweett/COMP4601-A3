Caruso has had his share of flops (Taking Lives, anyone) but with Distrubia he pretty much hit pay dirt and will without a doubt, make movies for years to come. Eagle Eye reminded me of Enemy Of The State in a lot of ways, and being that I'm a consiprasit, I could identify with the film and its paranoia. Shia Labruf (who I'm not tired of yet) turns in another good performance and he easily shows why in the next three to five years he'll be on Hollywood A-list. The nature of the film doesn't require Shia to be a hard-core action star, he's just an everyman put in a situation he doesn't want to be in. Michelle Monaghan does all right in the film but she has yet to equal her performance in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. The rest of the cast from Anthony Mackie & Rosario Dawson to Billy Bob Thornton all walk through their roles with ease. Eagle Eye is nothing more than popcorn escapist entertainment, and I can wait to see Shia in Transformers 2.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wow, critics are stupid!"></head><body><p>I have the whole Chronicles of Narnia series in one book and read The Magician's Nephew and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The Magician's Nephew probably should've been made a movie. Since it comes first and shows the creation of Narnia, how the animals talk and how the witch got there and how the lamp post even got there. Starting off with everything already there might confuse people who never read the books.<br /><br />  I think since I read the book, it's why I enjoyed the movie so much. But if you haven't you'll be entertained but think the movie is uneven and should explain stuff like how the witch got there and how she got in power. Anyway although those things should've probably been included, this is a very very faithful adaption of the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. It's what it should be like and is pretty much everything I read from the story. I mean the things that are missing aren't from this story, are from the story before it. So this can't be called a bad adaption at all. I guess those critics who gave it ** or ** 1/2 didn't read the books because this is the book about 95%.<br /><br />  Even the casting of Tilda Swinton as the Witch, is just brilliant. She is the part and just the way you'd picture her while reading. The special effects are perfect and should be nominated. The Lion looks great and is sometimes hard to believe he is computer animated. Liam Neeson is well fit to talk for him as well. Like I said Magician'ss Nephew should've been made so people who never read the books know what's going on. Still though the movie is enjoyable either way.<br /><br />  A lot of reviews are even calling the film a yawn. Even Ebert who gave it *** used the word "yawn" in his review header. I don't see how the movie is a yawn at all. Even when you think it will drag on, it doesn't. The movie goes pretty smoothly and isn't boring at all. There's enough wonder and entertainment to keep your attention through-out. Critics are the boring ones. They can sit through a boring 2 hour and 20 minute drama with no complaints. But when a fantasy is 2 hours and 20 minutes with action, adventure and wonder, they call it a yawn ? I doubt all the people clapping afterwards thought it was a yawn. The movie had so many loud and thrilling moments that it should've probably have been PG-13. So no way should the word "yawn" be used to explain this movie. I only think it was probably a little too violent to be PG and the kids voices can be annoying from time to time lol. Those are about my only complaints though.</p></body></html>

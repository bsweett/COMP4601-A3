<meta name="summary" content="The Fugitive"></head><body><p>A textbook example of a first-rate thriller, buoyed by Davis's breathless pacing and a picture-stealing performance from Jones, who won an Oscar. Drawing from his Indiana Jones days, Ford is just right as the besieged hero always one step ahead of disaster, but Jones's Gerard, whose drive is offset by a wry, folksy humor, is intensely charismatic as the intrepid hound-dog on Kimble's trail. Over ten years after its initial release, it's worth another peek if you haven't seen it since. First-timers should definitely plunge.</p></body></html>

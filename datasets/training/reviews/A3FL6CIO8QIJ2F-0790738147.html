Sometimes the studios are guilty for squandering money from consumers when they release a film yet again on DVD, only with a different cover art and if the purchaser is lucky you might get some extra new bonus material. However, with the rerelease of "LA Confidential" the studio gave the film a complete overhaul, not only in the DVD art, but the film itself has been completely restored to impeccable quality and there are a ton of new bonus features. Buying this new set is like watching the film all over again!<br /> "LA Confidential" deals with the underbelly of Hollywood in the 1950's where sex, greed, political scandal, and murder are examined by a bunch of Los Angeles police detectives headed by a then-unknown Russell Crowe in one of his first big-screen acting gigs. Guy Pearce (known for playing a drag queen in "Priscilla-Queen of the Dessert) and Kevin Spacey are Crowe's partners-in-crime. The film is stolen by the convincing performance by Kim Bassinger who plays a sexy Hollywood starlette who happens to be a call-girl. This role won Bassinger the Oscar for Outstanding Supporting Performance by an Actress. The movie also won the Oscar for Best Screeenplay.<br /> Upon release in 1997 the movie was a huge financial success raking in nearly $130,000,000.<br /> The DVD is filled to the brim with extras including new interviews, commentary, and more and comes with a bonus CD that features music from the film.</p></body></html>

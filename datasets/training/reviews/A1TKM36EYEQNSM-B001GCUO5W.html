<meta name="summary" content="Has you asking questions throughout"></head><body><p>This film may only be a one time view for some.  There are so many questions that you have throughout the movie and it seems they are answered at the end.  However, the last shot creates a question, so, is what you have at the end the reality or not?<br /><br />Similar in ways to movies like 'The Green Mile' in its depiction of the death of three children or like the surprise you may remember at the end of 'The Sixth Sense.'  This movie is sometimes very riveting and you are wondering if he is getting deeper into problems as the movie progresses.<br /><br />To me, there may have been a better viewership of this one if the trailers did not make it look like a horror movie.  At least to me, seeing what they portrayed made it look like that more than a suspense thriller.<br /><br />Dicaprio does a great job in his intensity and his confusion in dealing with his days attempting to solve a puzzle at the institution.  Is he going after someone, trying to expose a conspiracy, or what?  Ruffalo, Kingsley and von Sydow are just excellent in their delivery.  Kingsley comes across as compassionate, then he is adversarial, then down right confusion.  Since the movie takes place just a decade after WWII, you don't know if von Sydow's character is a former Nazi or not.  This all adds to the issues that Dicaprio is attempting to uncover.<br /><br />I would have viewed this earlier if not for thinking it was more of a horror film.  Overall, the plot is engaging and you are wondering when the next 'big thing' is going to happen.</p></body></html>

Great action sequences gave this film an edge over many of the other films that we saw this year. While watching this movie you really felt for the characters, and were really wanting them to catch whoever killed their beloved adoptive mother, although they go about it in the wrong way, you still had a sense of urgency. Very violent, profainity throughout, but with this kind of material..would you expect anything less???<br /><br />Really great movie for those that enjoy action with a real story attached to it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ham Versus Egg"></head><body><p>As she did with the two competing young American women in contemporary Tokyo (Anna Faris and Scarlet Johansson), omce again Sofia Coppola has written and directed a story, based on her own life, of an unsatisfied young bride hungry for attention who must contrast her own stifled dreams with the dramatically sensuous life of a rival.  In this case Coppola casts Asia Argento as the legendary Madama Du Barry, the favorite of the king.  Argento, the daughter of Italian horrormeister Dario Argento, is but one of several actors cast here because they, like Coppola herself, are "Hollywood royalty" and thus lend the picture an extra dimension by their mere presence in the cast list--Danny Huston, the son of the late John Huston, plays the Emperor of Austria here, in a few amusing scenes.<br /><br />It is said that just as she pursued Bill Murray for years, hounding him into taking the lead role in LOST IN TRANSLATION, Coppola used all her wiles, but unsuccessfully, hoping to lure French film icon Alain Delon into playing Louis XV, the man who kept Madame Du Barry constantly on hand no matter how much scandal it created in court.  Alas, Rip Torn took the part and plays it exactly as if he thought he was still filming THE LARRY SANDERS SHOW.  He's great and all, but a little out of place, whereas he should have been the still, ominous center of the film, the master of everything he controlled.<br /><br />It was whispered that Du Barry had been arrested 14 times on charges ranging from prostitution to witchcraft by the time she was presented at court in 1769, about a year before the action of Coppola's film takes place.  What a spectacle Asia makes of herself--licking Torn's face, feeding him wine and bits of food, letting him slobber up and down her generous cleavage.  "Don't hold back," Coppola must have told her.  "Remember, you're a magnificent wench!"  To ensure she gave the performance Coppola wanted, the director arranged for Asia Argento to watch a special screening, at the Cinematheque Francaise, of King Vidor's DUEL IN THE SUN, in which Jennifer Jones rips up the screen with passion as the "half-breed" Pearl Chavez.  Elderly theatergoers with long memories might recall that Ethel Merman, of all people, also essayed the part of Madame Du Barry, but Merman was refined as Gwyneth Paltrow compared to the finger licking, throw your head back and laugh evilly je je sais quoi of Asia Argento.<br /><br />Next to whom, poor Kirsten Dunst can do very little except refuse to speak to her.</p></body></html>

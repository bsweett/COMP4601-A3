<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful scenery + Spectacular special effects + Good fighting scenes + Very little dialogues = Worth watching"></head><body><p>I've not read the book this movie was based on. So, I don't know how much different it is from the novel.<br /><br />The scenery is poetic and attractive. The best thing about this film is the spectacular special effects, especially the water creature and the mice. They look life like. There is some good humor too. For example, when the cat was tied up by the mice. The fighting scenes are realistic and exciting. The sword fighting between Peter and King Miraz is tense and engaging.<br /><br />The big problem is it has very little dialogues. That does not help me connecting with the characters. This movie is all about action and beautiful pictures. It's still a good movie for kids.<br /><br />For this kind of genre, Lord of the Rings is still the only one on my Favorite list.</p></body></html>

I have not read Heinlein's book yet, this review is  based solely on the movie.  In its campy format you will find humor and entertainment in what can only be described as a dismal futuristic setting!  Dazzling performances by Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards and the alluringly gorgeous Dina Meyer!  Starship Troopers is a big movie that I have watched and enjoyed over and over again.  The director and producers did an outstanding job in making this film and its "bugs" exceptionally realistic.  Keep in mind that due to its brutal realism, this film is not for the faint of heart or the extremely young viewers.<p>The premise:  MINOR SPOILER<p>Picture a futuristic setting where the "problems" of democracy have been erased and one world government has been established, in effect, removing all of the borders and citizenship is earned through federal service.  We're introduced to the main characters that are in their last days of high school and preparing to enter federal service to earn their citizenship.  Among those main characters we have Johnny Rico, Carmen Ibanez and Dizzy Flores.  In short, Johnny loves Carmen, Carmen loves herself and her future and Dizzy loves Johnny, whew!  We're taken from there to Johnny and Dizzy being in boot camp for the Mobile Infantry and Carmen in flight training.<p>Klendathu, the home world of the bugs has been making attempts to destroy Earth by flogging asteroids at it.  Unfortunately, one makes it through the defenses and destroys the love triangles home town!  Earth immediately mobilizes its forces for an attack on the Klendathu home planet, where they are subsequently massacred by a much larger force of "bugs" than they collectively expected.<p>What follows from here can be described in no other terms than outstanding science fiction, action and drama rolled into one of the best Science Fiction flicks to ever grace the Silver Screen.  If you're even a minor Sci-Fi fan this DVD is a must for your collection!<p>On side B, we're treated to some wonderful test screenings between Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards, deleted scenes, theatrical trailers, a documentary and some very enthusiastic behind the scenes footage.  {ssintrepid}</p></body></html>

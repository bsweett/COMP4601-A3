Admittedly I had barely seen any previews and just new it was about some teenager pretending to be a superhero, but I thought it would be a comedy along the lines of Scary Movie, or Napoleon Dynamite.  I was wrong.<br /><br />Dave Lizewski is your normal average geeky kid.  Until he gets the idea to become a super hero that is.  Then he becomes a little bit more.  But being a super hero isn't all its cracked up to be when the crime starts fighting him back.  And then new super heroes start appearing on the scene, all with different agendas.  Dave feels a little over his head but can't help but get drawn in.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Dave Lizewski/Kick Ass-Aaron Johnson<br />Damon Macready/Big Daddy-Nicholas  Cage<br />Mindy Macready/ Hit Girl-Chloe Moretz<br />Chris D'Amico/Red Mist-Christopher Mintz-Plasse<br />Frank D'Amico-Mark Strong<br />and others...<br /><br />Nicholas Cage has his ups and downs for me, but I actually liked him in this.  I thought he did a great job and liked the voicings and expressions he used for his character.  It added to the comedic value.  Chloe Moretz as his daughter was also very good as well.  She plays quite a controversial character (young girl killing, swearing, etc.) but made it very believable.  That being said, the main character played by Aaron Johnson didn't really do anything for me.  He was important to the film but I thought he could have been better.  As it stands, I didn't really care what happened to him.  The bad guys weren't exactly intimidating either.<br /><br />As said before I had expected this to be more comedy.  While it was to an extent, I would peg it more action/adventure/drama because it did have a lot of serious parts.  Because of all that adventure though, there is a lot of gore and murder in this movie.  Those with faint constitutions may want to think twice before watching.  There is a lot of cussing as well.  For a plot I think this one was actually pretty good.  The movie has a point when it asks why more people don't try to be real superheroes and it does a good job of pointing out why that is.  A downside though is that the pacing is rather poor and this movie, despite being an action film, kind of dragged for me and spent to much time on irrelevant details.<br /><br />Not the best of movies but not the worst either.  I'd probably rate it 3.5 stars in total.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011</p></body></html>

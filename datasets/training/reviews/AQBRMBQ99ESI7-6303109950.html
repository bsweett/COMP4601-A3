<meta name="summary" content="Watch it for the Entertainment, Not the History"></head><body><p>The story of Wyatt Earp is fairly well known. People have heard of the gunfight at the OK Corral. Doc Holliday is a name known from legend. All these elements and more are present. I have no idea how historically accurate their portrayals are and I don't care. What I do care about is that this was a fun movie.<br /><br />Wyatt Earp and his brothers move to Tombstone to try and put their pasts behind them and cash in on the silver rush. While there, they get sucked back into the law enforcement business and try to clean up the town for decent folk. The problem is that the bad guys are really bad. As a result, the bad guy body count just keeps climbing until Wyatt triumphs. That's the story but it is not the "entertainment".<br /><br />I like seeing the bad guys get their comeuppance as well as the next guy but what makes this movie work is a combination of the story and the characterizations and the acting and the cinematography. It's all good. Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday does an especially fine job but the others get kudos as well. The good guys are "good" but they do have their human problems as well. The bad guys are nothing but bad and, eventually, dead.<br /><br />No one is going to earn academic credit for the history in this movie (I hope). That is beside the point. The purpose of this one is to see the good guys beat the bad guys and feel good about it. That alone is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Put your mind on hold and just sit back to enjoy it.</p></body></html>

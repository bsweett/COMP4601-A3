<meta name="summary" content="Least-Favorite Clancy Movie"></head><body><p>To date, this is probably the worst Clancy adaptation. Granted, this is set in a time frame before the others, but it is hard to imagine Jack Ryan being THIS incompetent. Come on, even summer interns would not have such problems. Some details are left out or hardly mentioned at all and other trivia goes on and on. Not to mention the lame how-fast-can-we-end-the-movie ending. Seems like the production must have been shut down and they had to scrounge what sections of film they had. Compared to the other Clancy movies I would give it an even lower rating, but since it is watchable in its own right, three stars.</p></body></html>

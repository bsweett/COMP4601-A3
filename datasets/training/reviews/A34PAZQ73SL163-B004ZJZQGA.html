<meta name="summary" content="Jolly Good"></head><body><p>This is an absolutely delightful film. Just how good In Bruges was took me by surprise. For one thing, the scenery was absolutely breathtaking--"it's like a fairy tale and all that." Personally, I'd take the same interest that Brendan Gleeson's character had in the city's architecture and beauty, but all of that is small beer compared to its plot and the excellence of the performances. I don't know much about Colin Farrell but loved him as Ray. He's very engaging and you can't help but cheer for him. Ralph Fiennes was actually the highlight of the film in my view. You can't wait to see him in person after his phone conversations and basically he becomes our primary focus once he appears on screen. In Bruges is a perfect mix of drama, action, and comedy--a combination that conforms to my taste as if it were made of spandex. It's a jolly good time and a great film.</p></body></html>

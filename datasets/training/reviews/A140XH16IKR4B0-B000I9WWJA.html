The film's plot advances by millimeters, in a seemingly unknowable direction. Folding back upon itself via the use of flash forwards and dramatized hypotheticals, the film always returns to the present, sometimes, but not always enriched by its wanderings.<br /><br />A well-planned hostage situation develops at a New York City bank. Dozens of hostages are taken, and they are cowed into submission by acts of profanity and violence. Keith Frazier, an NYPD detective and hostage negotiator played by Denzel Washington, is brought in to get into the minds of the criminals and to end the crisis. But this is no ordinary hostage situation, as the hostage-takers aren't playing by the normal rules. What are they after? Why are they stalling for time?<br /><br />The bank's philanthropist owner (Christopher Plummer) has taken an unusual interest in the situation. When he contacts a high society fixer (Jodi Foster) to retrieve property from the besieged bank, it becomes clear that he has a greater stake in the crisis than the good name of his bank. Foster, Washington and the lead hostage taker (played with intelligence and canny reserve by Clive Owen) soon find themselves in a dance of wills and activity.<br /><br />Spike Lee's cinematography is terrific. A long shot of the Brooklyn Bridge  is just one of many ornaments to this well-made film. The writing and the plot are believable -- and hold back on the unrelenting sarcastic chatter that makes up so many forgettable cop movies. The final plot lines are not tied up until literally the final few seconds of the film.<br /><br />Other than the pace of the film -- which mimics the wait-and-see pace of real negotiations (but is slow to the point of torpor) -- "Inside Man" is brilliant.</p></body></html>

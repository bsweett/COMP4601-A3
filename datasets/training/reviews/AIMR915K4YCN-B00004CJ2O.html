The camp has been known as &quot;Camp Blood&quot; ever since. In 1978, a man named Steve Christi decided to re-open the camp. It was the worst decision of his short life. FRIDAY THE 13TH is the classic original in what has become a monotonous stream of inferior sequels (10 to date and counting). Yes, there is a &quot;body count&quot;, but at least there's a good, creepy story to carry the carnage! Long before there was a mindless, invincible stalker and his 20+ year murder spree, there was the REASON for it all. In this first movie, we get the actual motive for all that hideous rage and it's gory result. This is a tale of vengeance fueled by insanity. Yes, we get to see WHO is killing the new arrivals at Crystal Lake. More importantly, in this one we get the answer to WHY they are dying. Yes, there is a Jason Vorhees. However, there is someone else who is equally frightening. Someone who will stop at nothing in order to exact revenge. This person is bitterness incarnate, compelled to destroy in order to feed the inner demon. To get &quot;justice&quot; for something that cannot be made right. We get a quick peak at the agony that started the bloodletting. This is rare in this type of movie! A well told campfire story, best viewed alone on a dark, rainy night. Highly recommended...</p></body></html>

"The Chronicles of Riddick" has no character development, no plot, in fact the video game is way better. In fact all Vin diesel does is trash talk, show his muscles, and adds no demension to the character. I want to know more about Riddick, I want to think more about Riddick, did he have a family before he became what he is, or are they just going to subject us to mindless action and no plot. Hopefully they'll add a third intallment, so I can find out. This film needs better acting and more meaning behind the action. "Kill Bill" showed that behind all of that blood thirsty action that there was a love story in the middle of it all. Why can't we get the same treatment and let it be entertaining as well.</p></body></html>

I thought the movie would offer something along the lines of the famous Ray Bradbury story. Boy, was I ever wrong.<p>The movie is, well it's just a movie. But it's the first time in a long time that I actually considered walking out of the theatre.  The convoluted plot begins near the end of the film, then flashbacks thirteen years before in time. Ashton Kutcher's character is a child who starts suffering from blackouts and has brain bleeding, similar to his father (who lives in a mental institution). Kutcher's character soon learns that he can travel back through time by reading journals from his youth. He has to concentrate on what he is doing and he is only able to travel back in his own life and control his former self. That doesn't really make any sense and the movie doesn't either. I guess the best way to describe it is a cross between SOMEWHERE IN TIME and BEING JOHN MALKOVICH.<p>The movie doesn't really make any sense. I heard several people say near the end of the film, "I have no idea what is going on." Also, the film is such a bizarre blend, that it just left the audience confused. For instance, there were several times in the movie that were clearly meant to be serious, but not in a shocking way:  several people were laughing and several people were gasping in shock. Of course, besides all the confusion, there's also the fact that the film doesn't remain true to logic.  For instance, Kutcher's character goes back in time to the exact same period of his childhood at least two times. His character performs different actions all three times, which makes no sense whatsoever.  As for the "big questions" this movie supposedly raises, it really doesn't ask any. It just appears that it does, kind of like a political candidate appearing to answer a question without really answering it.<p>Just trying to write about the movie is confusing and is gives me a headache. I would recommend staying away from this film at all costs because it really is a waste of your time (the only things worthwhile in the film are Kutcher and Amy Smart and the eerie musical score). However, if you do see it, be forewarned--you won't be able to travel back and repair your "mistake".</p></body></html>

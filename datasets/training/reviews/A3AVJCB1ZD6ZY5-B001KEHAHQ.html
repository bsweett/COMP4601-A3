<meta name="summary" content="Martin never equals Sellers, but Martin + Kline comes close!"></head><body><p>I was pretty reluctant to view the new film because, I love the original series with Peter Sellers.  In my opinion, the first "Pink Panthers" are some of the funniest films ever made.<br /><br />While Steve Martin alone does not match Peter Sellers' comedic genius, Steve Martin and Kevin Kline make up a great duo.  They were several times when I lost myself laughing uproariously.  The film is worth viewing just for the two of them.<br /><br />The plot:  France's well-beloved soccer coach is killed just 3 weeks before the French Medal of Honor.  The chief Inspector of International Police (Kline) realizes he cannot take the case.  So he brings in Clousseau, thus depriving a remote French village of their idiot, and sets him on the case planning to take over at the last minute and solve the crime.  To his surprise and undoing, Clousseau stumbles into the solution.</p></body></html>

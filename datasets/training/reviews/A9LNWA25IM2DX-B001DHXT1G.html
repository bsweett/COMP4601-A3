<meta name="summary" content="Incredible in HD (Actual Bluray review)"></head><body><p>The Movie<br /><br />Presented in what I understand is the first ever not-blue-BD case and with a limited edition 3D cover, the incredible film from Louis Leterrier arrives to BluRay. I do not intend to get into many details of the film as other reviewers have already done so, the franchise reboot was indeed of great help, the cast and their performances are simply incredible and very serious for a film of this kind. What made this Hulk movie better than the previous one is the fact that the people behind it are trying to set the Marvel universe in a real-world scenario, with great results. Add the factor of Marvel being involved, the special cameo by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), several references to the "super-soldier" and the imminent coming of an "Avengers" film and even non-fans will want more!<br /><br />The picture and audio quality in the BD are superb, while the movie does not have too many sequences that could take advantage of the format (such as "Speed Racer" by the Wachowski brothers) the fight sequences look and sound clean and sharp. The level of detail high definition brings is very notorious in this BD as the deleted scenes included are presented in standard definition, so after watching a HD film presentation and going to the extras to watch the material not included the difference in quality is huge (Not sure really why the deleted scenes were not presented in HD though)<br /><br />The Extras<br /><br />All extras except the deleted scenes are presented in full HD.<br /><br />The famous alternate opening sequence is included, Leterrier was known of being very fond of this sequence that was removed in the end. The digital effects in this sequence however, were not finished for this release, so the little bit we see of the Hulk is a rough CG shot.<br /><br />An animated comic in which they based one of the sequences of the film is also included, for me, watching a comic book drawn by Tim Sale animated in HD was a very interesting experience being a fan of him. As a reference and if you are not familiar with his work, he also draws all the paintings used in the TV show "Heroes".<br /><br />Documentaries included are "Making of the Incredible", "Becoming the Hulk", "Becoming the Abomination" and "Anatomy of a Hulk out". Each of them has interviews with the people involved in each process, from the motion capture artists to the actors bringing those characters to life in the film.<br /><br />The picture in picture feature provides a lot of details and interesting facts but it requires of course of watching the movie at least a couple times more. The UControl feature also includes data from the comic books that inspired shots in the film as well as character files.<br /><br />The feature I was more excited about is the only one presented in standard definition. There are several deleted scenes included; watching them you can see that one of the sequences that suffered more is the one with Betty and Banner at her house. Also there were more references to the "super soldier" that were removed. Unfortunately the fact that these are not HD makes them look bad and out of place in a HD presentation.<br /><br />Audio for the main feature is presented in DTS-HD 5.1, Dolby digital 2.0, Spanish and French 5.1. Subtitles included are English, Spanish and French.<br /><br />A digital copy of the movie is also included.</p></body></html>

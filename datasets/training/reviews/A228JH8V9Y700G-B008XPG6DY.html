Perhaps the best thing about these movies is guessing who really is the villain and what the bigger plan is.  For me, I guessed the ending about halfway through the movie and left the remainder to unfold.  Still, this was a good movie.<br /><br />Clive Owen plays Charles, a well to do, average guy in a Chicago suburb who is living a somewhat boring and somewhat troubled life.  His marriage is not exactly happy these days, and he has a sickly, diabetic child who is taking a toll on him.  On a train to the city one day, he meets a clever, cheerful Jennifer Aniston.  They go from casual aquaintences to friends, then, thinking this is going to turn into a Fatal Attraction-esque movie, he decides to have a tryst with Aniston in a sleazy hotel room.  Their encounter goes terribly wrong when a mugger breaks in, and soon he is being terrorized literally and figuratively by his own guilt and the mugger's continued harassment of him and his family.<br /><br />How many little moments of insanity have cost us things?  Adultery, wanting to steal that pretty little item, greediness, and jealousy have always motivated us to do things we wish we hadn't.  And we wish we hadn't given into those little wants or needs that ended up costing us things.  It is part of life's learning experiences.  None of us are perfect.  This is an extreme example of what happens when we don't think about the consequences of our actions.  A good movie, a tad predictable, but still a good time.</p></body></html>

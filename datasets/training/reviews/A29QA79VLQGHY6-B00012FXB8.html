The behemoth stands at the intersection of video obsession and science-fiction geekdom, a space nearly as creepy as any visited in the films. Not scared off? Climb aboard -- here's one long strange trip worth taking. <p>DVD producer Charles de Lauzirika (&quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;) has pulled together a quarter century's worth of &quot;Alien&quot; matter -- outtakes, production clips, art elements, promo materials, etc. -- somehow emerging with a coherent package. Some elements return from the series' fairly ambitious video past, but much of the content is new or unseen.<p>The set's backbone is what amounts to a 12-hour documentary, carved up into digestible segments of about three hours (and then again into featurettes, if the viewer chooses that navigation option). De Lauzirika weaves a tale populated by a Shakespearean cast of heroes, villains and martyrs, most of whom have their say in new interviews. Even the DVD docu itself is not without drama -- De Lauzirika pulled his name from the piece on &quot;the tragedy of Alien 3&quot; after the studio removed some of the more volatile material about the shoot.<br /><br />In addition to great-looking versions of the four original theatricals, &quot;Quadrilogy&quot; streams in alternate versions of the films, basically director's cuts, three of them new to home video. The directors briefly introduce the rearranged movies, and join key cast and crew members in new commentaries. Only director David Fincher of &quot;Alien 3&quot; is missing in action, a shame because his film went through the most radical renovation.<p>The &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot; layout gives viewers a fighting chance, with a logical and uniform approach to content. Menus look good (and creepy), with little guesswork required. (Unfortunately, there's no main onscreen index.) Each title takes up two discs: one for the film(s) and another for bonus materials. A ninth DVD does clean-up with trailers and such. The films' release dates crack open a few Easter Eggs.</p></body></html>

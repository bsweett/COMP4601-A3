<meta name="summary" content="The Most Inspiring Musical Of The 20th Century."></head><body><p>In the 1960's Julie Andrews played a part in two of the most definitive musicals of the 20th Century. Disney's Mary Poppins and Rodgers & Hammerstein's The Sound of Music, both gave someone a clean cut fun and heart warming experience that had many people humming the songs for decades. Out of the two I would say The Sound of Music is the better and has left me with a huge level of admiration for Dame Julie Andrews. She has an amazing singing voice, and a class and grace unmatched by any fellow actress.<br /><br />The film tells the story of a young clumsy nun named Maria who is considered a nuisance by most of her fellow sisters in the convent. One day she is sent out to the Von Trapp family as the house led by Captain Von Trapp is after a new governess to take care of his 7 children. The Von Trapp household is led like one of his old navy ships, where he commands his children with the blow of a whistle forcing them to march and work, but there is no play. Maria becomes determined to teach the captain and the children what it's like to have fun, and one time whilst he's away to Vienna she takes her chance to let the children have fun and teach them to sing. This leads to a heart warming story which allows the children to sing and represent their home country of Austria.<br /><br />In my personal view this film hasn't aged a bit, I haven't seen it for a few years and actually think the last time I watched this was when I was 10 years old (I'm 22 now). Watching it again today, unlike most films from my childhood, my opinion of this has not changed one bit, I still love it as much as I remember doing so all them years ago. The intro actually gave me chills as I began reminiscing of this film and how good it actually was.<br /><br />The music of course is the main focus of the film, it has some of possibly the most catchy and memorable songs that could have you embarrassingly singing along at the top of your voice. Health Warning: You could end up with a sore throat after trying to sing-a-long. The kids are amazing with their music pieces as the general harmony of them is shocking, even considering their age with the youngest being 5. Of course Dame Julie was on top form and served as the delightful support for the child choir.<br /><br />The setting of the film in 1930's Austria actually gives this film a beautiful look, which gives you the understanding just as to why the character of Maria is such a happy person. If I were certainly living in such a beautiful country I have no doubt I would be the same. The film was primarily shot on location with very little need for purpose built sets or cardboard backgrounds. Because of the beautiful environments if done right it will look even more spectacular on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />I don't think this classic is really for a new audience as most young viewers wouldn't really appreciate the light hearted attitude and general good feel of it all. It wouldn't fit in with todays standard of films, it doesn't have violence, it doesn't have crude language and it doesn't have a smidgen of nudity. It's a wholesome film for the entire family, it doesn't need parental guidance or anyone to explain the film. I would say that although it's unlikely to captivate any new or young audiences, it's a film that will certainly convey a good and hearty message of love and positivity.</p></body></html>

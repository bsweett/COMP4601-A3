When he thought he was actually fighting in Afghanistan. Now he finds himself in somebody else's body, on a train, with a pretty girl that he never saw in his life. While he still struggles to figure it out, the train blows up in a fire ball.<br />Rewind. Do it again. Captain Goodwin, Colleen, tells our hero, Captain Stevens, Colter, who is in some kind of capsule, via a screen, that he has 8 minutes to find the bomb and to figure out who is the bomber. And back to square 1. More than once. Some progress each time.<br />I liked it, I am usually fascinated by time travel stories. Going back and changing the past looks like a pretty good idea to me. Never mind the complications.<br />If you think of figuring out the holes in the plot, be my guest.</p></body></html>

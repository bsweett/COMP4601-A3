<meta name="summary" content="The Bourne Supremacy (Blu-ray)"></head><body><p>Movie - 5.0<br /><br />As I said in my review of the first film, I stand by the belief that the Bourne franchise has ultimately changed the face of spy-thriller movies forever. Sure, the occasional flashy James Bond flick was fun to watch, but there's only so much style you can take after a while till it becomes a bit redundant. Thankfully, these Bourne films were so successful that they were able to re-imagine Agent 007 in a different light, a dark, grittier one that you can clearly see in their current films since Daniel Craig took over the title. But that's beside the point. The point is that I'm really, really thankful because if Doug Liman and Paul Greengrass never directed these, who knows what kind of mediocrity we'd be having to put up with instead. The Bourne Supremacy opens up 2 years after the end of Identity. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and Marie (Franka Potente) are living in Goa supposedly out of the grasp of anyone looking to find them. Bourne has recently begun having nightmares about a man and woman he once assassinated, but still can't manage to piece together anything else relevant between that and his past days in Treadstone. Meanwhile, an operation in Berlin to uncover a mole amongst the top CIA brass, led by Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), goes south when a Russian federal agent, Kirill (Karl Urban), infiltrates the deal and takes out the informant while leaving a fingerprint of Bourne to cover his tracks. Then in an attempt to put Bourne out of the picture, Marie is killed in his stead. Grieved and angered by the loss, Bourne sets out to find those responsible. However, in his pursuit of vengeance, he would discover things about his past that would change him for the better. The Bourne Identity was a refreshing breath of fresh air showing us a man who, at one point, was a cold-blooded killer doing his duty, but upon certain events had a change of heart. A major reason for that was because of a woman he met, a woman that stayed with him and showed him the side of life he had been missing out on. Upon losing her, this man would once again fall into the web of coverups, deception, and lies in search of truth, retribution, and eventual redemption. As if Identity didn't establish the humanity within Bourne enough, Supremacy takes that aspect even further by provoking an act of pure, motivated revenge, that otherwise evolves into a search for inner peace and a realization of humility. With this being the first of director Paul Greengrass' installments, the pacing of both the plot and action are doubly intensified. In addition, the cinematography, fight and stunt choreography, music, and production easily surpass its predecessor. The camera cuts are as quick and vicious as Bourne's ability to take people out, the fights more brutal, the chases more adrenaline-pumping, the music more pulsating, and best of all, the story more symbolic. This definitely takes care of the emotional side of the story arc, and even then, the final part of trilogy will manage to surpass that. Keep going, you're almost done.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />- Video codec: VC-1<br />- Video resolution: 1080p<br />- Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />Same director of photography, different director for the movie. The result: an amazing and visceral image compared to the first one! Paul Greengrass did a superb job not only propelling the franchise to new heights with the story, but also with the aesthetic presentation. Black levels are very deep (maybe a little too deep for some) making that sense of mystery and intrigue established in Identity that much more mysterious and intriguing. Even as hot and bright as the colors are in the Goa scenes, the blacks and more balanced contrast give the overall image so much more definition. The colors, by the way, are quite bold this time around. Goa alone has an exuberant amount of reds, oranges, and browns that make you feel like you're in the heat with Bourne and Marie. And even with a very fine layer of grain, detail and sharpness remain intact. Just look a the sweat running down the characters' faces, the texturing in the trees, ground objects, and street markets. And only a fraction of the movie even takes place here. The journey to Berlin is considerably darker, with a lot of the backdrops having more opaque set pieces, more interior shots (with small rooms and such), and a few more scenes shot at nighttime. The black levels are amazing here, but there's surprisingly a sparse amount of noise and grain to get in the way. And finally, the last part of the film in Moscow has a lot of color differentiation. The car chase sequence displays excellent detail in terms of line delineation and object clarity, especially when things start crashing and parts, glass, and other debris go flying around the street. My favorite shots for reference are the scene in Goa when Kirill is standing on the beach looking for Bourne (lots of color), the scene in Munich when Bourne pays a visit to the sole remaining Treadstone agent (lots of grain, but also lots of detail considering how close up the shots are), and finally the car chase in the Moscow tunnel (a little dim, but not super-dark, and again, lots of grain and detail). Some people may think the grain is a bit excessive, but I love the filmic texture it adds. And because of that I can't find any fault in the video.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Languages<br />- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />- French: DTS 5.1<br />- Spanish: DTS 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles<br />- English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />In conjunction with the newer cinematography, the sound is also vastly improved. While the quality in Identity was pretty top-notch itself, there weren't enough moments for it to truly shine. The design and mixing in Supremacy, however, is quite aggressive. The biggest upgrade I noticed immediately is the general immersion. Scenes like the bustling streets of Goa or the protest rally at Alexanderplatz offer all kinds of separation and directionality. You can hear individual vehicles making noise, people talking, the change in volume when objects are in the way, the transference of sounds when the camera pans or cuts to a different angle, and these aren't even the real action sequences. Stuff like the foot chase in Berlin and the car chase in Moscow offer even more sonic perfection in terms of subtlety, dynamic range, and overall buoyancy. My favorite aspects of the audio, though, are its isolation, and the way the music is used. Particularly, I really love the scene where Bourne fights the last Treadstone agent. There's absolutely no music here, and the fight itself is contained in this small little area where you can hear every punch, shuffle, footstep, knife swipe, and paper slap without a single exterior source to disturb it. I personally think this is the most intense scene of the entire film, and a lot of it has to do with the sound, or lack thereof. And then there's the music. The more I keep listening to the score and sampling all the various parts of the movie for reference, the more I'm starting to like John Powell. As a composer, he really lets loose here with the strings and drums. The level at which the music is played is as subtle as the movie's sound effects, and when the pieces actually are played, it really puts you in the scene. LFEs are especially pounding, as the score pulsates and propels the action. Meanwhile, the car chase is probably the other big sequence to pay attention to. The cars running into each other and crashing offer up some pretty good rumbles that, if you have a decent sound system, should provide plenty of room-shaking bass. And yes, like the story itself, the sound gets even better in Ultimatum.<br /><br />Extras - 4.5<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (Director Paul Greengrass)<br />This is a much different commentary than what Doug Liman gave for Identity. While Liman talked a lot about the technical aspects of the filming, Greengrass goes very in-depth about the writing and how he wanted to present certain themes/ideas through the action, especially in the way it was shot. A lot of people complain about the shaky camerawork and quick editing, but Greengrass repeatedly emphasizes how he wanted to keep it "real" (which is also presented as a short featurette on its own in the special features). In allowing the cameras to be handheld and literally follow Bourne's character in everything he does, its intent is to put the audience with him, as well as give the film a more gritty feel. He constantly breaks down key moments of the film as they unfold and goes on to talk about the actors, namely, why he cast them, what he liked about them, and how their personalities reflected well in their characters. There were a few more dead spots in this commentary than there were with Liman's, but it's just as informative and worth a listen.<br /><br />- Explosive Deleted Scenes (SD; 10:46)<br />Not much to say about them.<br /><br />- Matching Identities: Casting (SD; 5:23)<br />Talks about the casting. Greengrass starts off by giving Damon high praise for his ability to play both sides of Bourne so well (the tortured soul, and the ruthless killer). He also says he liked the choice of Allen to play Landy, as he thinks she's quite classy, much like Chris Cooper was for his role in Identity. He then goes on to talk about the film not having one bad guy, but that they were all part of a bad system (which will become very important for the third film).<br /><br />- Keeping it Real (SD; 4:58)<br />Talks about the process of selecting Greengrass to become the new director of the franchise. He says he wanted to portray a truthfulness and realism, which shows through the shaky-camera cinematography. He also makes the point of not wanting the actors to think too much so that their movements are more instinctual and intense.<br /><br />- Blowing Things Up (SD; 4:00)<br />Shows how they blew up the house in Munich and how they didn't us any CG because they wanted more realism to it. Interestingly enough, they got the whole shot in just one take.<br /><br />- On the Move with Jason Bourne (SD; 4:45)<br />Takes a look at the scouting and talks about how they wanted to film the real places in Europe for the film. Berlin was chosen for its historical relevance and as an homage to old spy stories. Moscow was chosen because the city itself has never really been used for movies and because Greengrass felt it gave off a vibe of truthfulness. And then Goa was chosen because it reflected the exuberance and restlessness represented in Bourne's character at that moment in the film.<br /><br />- Bourne to be Wild: Fight Training (SD; 4:21)<br />Shows us the staging for the fight between Bourne and the last remaining Treadstone agent. Fight coordinator Jeff Imada goes over the basic concept of the Kali style used, Greengrass points out how he wanted to really use Venetian blinds for the aesthetic of the scene and that he wanted the fight too look sloppy and raw, yet structured at the same time.<br /><br />- Crash Cam: Racing Through the Streets of Moscow (SD; 5:58)<br />Shows us how the riveting car chase sequence was filmed. They wanted this to be better than the one in Identity by putting a sense of desperation in Bourne to get to his destination, and they did so by making all the cameras either loose or handheld and putting them either in the car or very close to the windows.<br /><br />- The Go-Mobile Revs Up the Action (SD; 6:49)<br />Talks about the Go-Mobile, a camera rig that essentially attaches itself to the front end of a vehicle to put an actor right in the action of a car-driving sequence. They say it's built to be safe (with a very low center of gravity so it never tips over) and that it allows for a lot of different camera angles you wouldn't normally be able to get.<br /><br />- Anatomy of a Scene: The Explosive Bridge Chase Scene (SD; 4:40)<br />A look at how the foot chase in Berlin was filmed. Damon says shooting it was safe and fun.<br /><br />- Scoring with John Powell (SD; 4:46)<br />I love when we can actually take a look at the scoring of a film, especially here because I feel the music in the Bourne series is such an important driving force. Powell says he doesn't conduct, but likes to offer a lot of input during the process. He also says the score itself re-uses a lot of the themes from the first film, but that the new one created for Goa is meant to represent Marie and that it follows Bourne around till the end of the movie. Specifically, it's a theme that plays during her funeral scene, then comes full circle to symbolize his eventual atonement.<br /><br />- The Bourne Mastermind (Part 2) (SD; 4:42)<br />More rehashed interviews with Ludlum that you might have already seen if you watched the ones on Identity. There's a little more additional retrospect here, but not much else.<br /><br />- The Bourne Diagnosis (Part 2) (SD; 5:39)<br />Gives us a little more psychological analysis on Bourne, most notably how his flashbacks are tormenting him and how Marie represents his humanity and the choice of living. And upon her death, his quest for revenge sets Bourne on a journey to find his past and some eventual answers to what's been troubling him.<br /><br />- U-Control<br />More interactive PiP applications that play during the film:<br /><br />- The Bourne Dossier<br />Same as the Treadstone Files option in Identity. It's just a bunch of statistics and factoids in the form of a gimmicky spy computer thingy for people, places, and certain situations. It's cool if you like trivia, but like I said, it's a bit of a novelty, if anything else.<br /><br />- Bourne Orientation<br />Recaps of important plot points, though not in the sense of interviews like the actual PiP commentary. It's a bit redundant and totally okay to skip it.<br /><br />- Picture in Picture<br />The real meat of the extras. It's actually quite humorous at the beginning when producer Frank Marshall says that the feature was made exclusively for "this HD-DVD," which obviously is a dead format now, but after that it's pure gold in terms of information. The PiP takes most of the footage from the other special features listed above. However, it also includes a very large amount of interviews and footage not included in said extras and is full of crucial commentary and analysis of the story itself, as well as a few anecdotes from cast and crew. Most of the feature has the actors breaking down their characters and talking about what it was like working with one another. I was very glad to hear interpretations from Brian Cox and Karl Urban, who play antagonists, but really don't get a whole lot of screen time in general to fully develop themselves. So to hear them talking about how the characters fit into the plot and what they thought about their roles was very interesting. This is by far the best special feature on this disc, and I wholly recommend you make it a mandatory watch if you're interested in the production of the film itself and its literary composition. And unlike the PiP in Identity, this one actually runs for the entire length of the movie, as opposed to 3-5 minute chunks for 8 chapters.<br /><br />Overall - 5.0<br /><br />While the franchise is changing directors at this point, the plot still continues to thicken. I find it to be an interesting take on the character of Jason Bourne. And to further iterate, I really, really thank the people involved because without the Bourne movie franchise, James Bond wouldn't have followed suit, and I don't think I would love the Daniel Craig movies as much as I do today. In the meantime, Universal presents Supremacy with some demo-worthy A/V specs and a deceptively informative set of extras. Do yourself a favor and get ready for a spy-thriller with a lot of heart, then prepare for an even more thrilling adventure in the final act, Ultimatum.</p></body></html>

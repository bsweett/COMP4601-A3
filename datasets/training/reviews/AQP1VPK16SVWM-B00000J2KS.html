<meta name="summary" content="Classic satire but it isn't for everybody-Revised review for 40th Anniversary release of 5/31/11"></head><body><p>Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" is a dark, brutal satire of the youth culture of the 70's a sort of inversion of the "peace, love" generation that preceded it that captures the narcissitic 80's a full decade before the "Me" culture of greed and self involvement took center stage.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is the same transfer as the previous Blu-ray disc and some clips from the new documentary stuff looks better than THIS transfer. This transfer doesn't look horrible BUT WHY Warner didn't include the 4K new transfer they just did for the new theatrical showing is beyond me. They could have very easily because they didn't just throw the old disc from the previous set into new packaging.<br /><br />What's in this edition?<br /><br />This latest 40 anniversary two disc edition features the same transfer as the previous edition so if you are looking for an upgrade the image quality is exactly the same encode (although freeing up some of the disc space may have improved the quality slightly I didn't see it). We also get a lossless DTS 5.1 mix rather than the uncompressed LPCM soundtrack--the only difference is the latter consumes less disc space but they are comparable in quality.  The inclusion of the previous transfer isn't necessarily a bad thing as Warner did an exceptional job and the additional room on the disc allows for a very slight improvement for the film. Keep in mind that "A Clockwork Orange" is a 40 year old film and, as such, it looks quite good and striking for its age but it's unlikely to look like it was shot yesterday. There's plenty of fine grain on display as well giving the presentation a nice, striking quality.<br /><br />The real reason to upgrade this if you are a fan of the movie and Kubrick is the inclusion of Jan Harlan's documentary on Kubrick (Harlan was Kubrick's brother-in-law and co-producer for many of his films)on disc two. It's an exceptional documentary that was previously only available in the Stanley Kubrick DVD boxed set from a couple of years back. It is, however, presented in standard definition. All of the special features from the previous single disc Blu-ray have been retained.<br /><br />Ported over from the previous edition is the documentary "O Lucky Malcolm" (referring to another dark satire that the star Malcolm McDowell was involved in "O Lucky Man")but not on disc two. "O Lucky Malcolm" is presented in HD.<br /><br />We also get the excellent commentary from Nick Redman and McDowell that is both enlightening and an intelligent take on the meaning of the film now and then.<br /><br />We also get some new special features in high def but including one with McDowell recalling working on the film while flipping through production photos and another where he recites Alex's opening speech as other directors discuss how our world reflects the world of the movie (It does and it doesn't. It's also much more complex than that)and how it influenced other films.<br /><br />Finally there's the "book"--the Blu-ray discs are housed in a hardcover book with production photos.<br /><br />Kubrick's adaption of Burgess' novel is a sort of  inverted Pygmalion. As brilliant as Burgess' novel, the film brings some of the best sequences in the  novel to life with stunning, brutal clarity and satiric wit. Burgess himself  acknowledged as much stating that Kubrick's film was a "radical  remaking of my own novel" that was every bit Kubrick's as the source  material was Burgess.<br /><br />Kubrick's  most controversial film ( perhaps even more so than Lolita), this is a  classic film that is a radical as mainstream cinema gets.<br /><br />The bottom line: Should you buy this again if you have the single disc Blu-ray? I'd say no unless you don't have the Kubrick documentary which is excellent (although it would have been nice to see that upgraded to HD)and the few new featurettes included. The price difference may make a difference in that decision as well since this is a bit more expensive than the original single disc edition. If you don't have it--get it but if you have the previous single disc edition (unless you must have the excellent documentary "A Life in Pictures" about Kubrick), I'd skip this edition and spent your money on something new like the forthcoming reissues of "Lolita" and "Barry Lyndon".<br /><br />If you have the previous edition--wait until they reissue this with the 4K upgrade for the Blu-ray edition.</p></body></html>

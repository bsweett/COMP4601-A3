<meta name="summary" content="Movie-Making Breakthrough, and a Great Story as Well"></head><body><p>This is a movie that needed to be made. It was just the right vehicle with which to go mainstream with a gay love story.<br /><br />It starts in 1963, when Ennis and Jack spend the summer as sheepherders (not cowboys, although Jack also does rodeos) on Brokeback Mountain. In a scene that seemed completely authentic to someone with no personal experience of homosexuality but plenty experience in sexuality, they end up making love one night in their tent. And we have to say making love, not having sex. There is real feeling here along with the masculine horseplay. Thus begins a loving friendship that lasts over 20 years, mostly on "fishing trips" and other camping adventures away from wives and prying eyes.<br /><br />Remember this starts in 1963, long before the word "gay" had been developed as a healthy way to describe male homosexuality. They had a lot nastier terms in those days. And Ennis remembers when he was a child, his Daddy took him and his brother to view the remains of a man who had been mutilated and killed for being one of a couple of men who lived together. Understand this: he did NOT happen upon the corpse accidentally; his daddy took him to see it. As Ennis said, he probably was one of the people that did it.<br /><br />So naturally they want no one to know about their relationship. Thus the movie explores some of the hazards of closets.<br /><br />OK, no spoilers here. But you definitely do not have to be gay, or even bi, to appreciate this movie. That is exactly what's so valuable about it. Even straights can have real sympathy for the two close friends, likable guys, who look the part, but just don't quite fit the stereotype of the he-man of the western mountains, the rodeo and the ranch.</p></body></html>

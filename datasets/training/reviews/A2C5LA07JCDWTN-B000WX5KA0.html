Taxi Driver is more than a  little rough around the edges, although it is leaps and bounds better than  Mean Streets.  The film has an urban feel and Scorcese truly captures the  essence of the city through magnificent cinematography.  However, De Niro  is a master at grasping the audiences attention and not letting go.  You  never really know what Bickel is going to do next, he is a loose cannon in  a dangerous urban jungle.  Travis Bickel is every American's nightmare and  wet dream rolled up into one.  This movie requires repeated viewing, but I  will say this, Taxi Driver has one of the most memorable endings that you  will ever witness.  Happy Viewing!  P.S. This movie has warped my fragile  little mind!</p></body></html>

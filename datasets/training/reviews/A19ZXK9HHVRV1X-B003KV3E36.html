<meta name="summary" content="Dreadful action flick"></head><body><p>There's something inherently distasteful about taking a real-life tragedy - the genocide in Burma - and using it as fodder for yet another fantasy-fueled "Rambo" movie.<br /><br />After a 18-year hiatus, Sylvester Stallone returns to one of his two signature roles (the other, of course, being Rocky) - that of Vietnam War vet, John Rambo, the world-weary and cynical reluctant warrior who, in this installment, is hired to lead a group of mercenaries into Burma to rescue some American missionaries being held captive there.  Rambo may not be able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, but he is certainly capable of wiping out a whole cadre of Burmese soldiers all by his lonesome.  The poor people being systematically slaughtered under that regime will, I'm sure, be relieved to hear he's on his way.<br /><br />Despite a terrifically high body count and endless footage of stomach-churning carnage, it's amazing just how utterly dull an action movie "Rambo" turns out to be.  Stallone, as always, mumbles and grunts his way through his part, which, considering the laughably pretentious dialogue assigned to him (especially in "reflective" voiceover narration), is probably the wisest choice he could have made under the circumstances.  Graham McTavish displays some fire in the belly as a belligerent mercenary, but he's the only one on either side of the camera who seems to be putting any real effort into the movie.</p></body></html>

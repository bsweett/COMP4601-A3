Oh, yeah, this movie."></head><body><p>While the first couple of Terminator films were by no means great works of art, they'll seem like "Citizen Kane" compared to this unrelentingly tedious sequel.  Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role as a "good" Terminator, once again sent into the past to stop an assassination by a "bad" Terminator (Aryan poster girl Kristanna Loken) that will change the future.  Or will it?  Never mind trying to make sense of what is going on on or why this film contradicts its predecessor, the plotting and dialogue are the stuff of 13-year-old imaginations, which is to say that lots of things happen but without the requisite character interactions to make you care anyway.  Instead, there are plenty of explosions and shoot `em ups, orchestrated by director Jonathan Mostow without the energized, pornographic attention to detail that talented schlockmeisters like James Cameron can bring to bear.  Nick Stahl, who looks so much like the lead in "Malcolm in the Middle" I expected him to break wind, is a better John Connor than the irritating Edward Furlong, but that isn't saying much.  Once promising TV star Clare Danes vacillates between stupid and annoying in her portrayal of a veterinarian who is, well, stupid and annoying - in fairness to her, the script does give her such gems as "Oh, my god" and "Let me out of here!" for banter.  Despite all the money spent on this film, it seems rather half-baked, and even the noisy climax in some relatively impressive sets will lull you into a stupor.  One of the few redeeming qualities, though, is to watch Schwarzenegger obviously age from the slathered-in-makeup, perhaps digitally revised figure he is at the start of the film.  Maybe they'd exhausted the budget for such niceties by the middle of filming.  "Terminator 3" might please less discriminating viewers, but anyone looking for an edge-of-your-seat thriller would be advised to look elsewhere.</p></body></html>

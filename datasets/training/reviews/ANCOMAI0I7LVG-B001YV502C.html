It's heartbreaking, eye opening and most of all heartwarming with its depictions of hope shining forth from the bitterness of the present.  In `Children of Men' we encounter a torn London, savaged and broken down with despair and hopelessness.  The world has collapsed in the few short years following the infertility epidemic and now, resting in the year 2027, all seems to be lost.  The film does a brilliant job of capturing the feeling of hopelessness and apathetic attitude that forms in the hearts of earths residents.<br /><br />There is no reason to care anymore because humans in general have no future.<br /><br />This is where we meet Theo Faron.  Theo's life is all but dead to him.  Clive Owen masterfully displays the utter desperation that plagues this mans soul.  We can read this across the crevasses of his face, the saddened expression in his eyes, the downward slant of his brow and then sulk in his step.  Even his words struggle to find themselves as he speaks to others in attempts at communication.  This is the first thing that I noticed about Alfonso Cuaron's masterpiece.  Clive Owens performance beautifully compliments the ravaged setting he inhabits.<br /><br />Theo finds himself kidnapped and violently escorted to a secret meeting with his ex-wife Julian, the leader of a rebel activist group.  She is requesting his assistance in transporting a young woman, a refugee who has a secret, a very important secret.  He soon finds out what that secret is when he meets young Kee, a Fiji born woman who is, believe it or not, pregnant.  Thus begins a harrowing journey to transport Kee to meet up with `The Human Project', an organization willing to help her.  Theo meets much opposition along the way, some expected, some not, but the journey is worth any cost.<br /><br />Alfonso Cuaron was unfairly snubbed a directing nomination last year.  He brilliantly crafted this film so that the audience can take this journey alongside Theo and Kee, feeling every emotion and even stirring some new ones in the pit of our souls.  The film is expertly executed and completely absorbing to watch.  The sets are so real, so authentic, so engrossing that I could feel the concrete floor against my feet and breathe in the thick air.  The cinematography is orgasmic and it's an utter shame that it lost the much deserved Oscar.  As the camera swept through each scene I found myself inching closer to the screen to take it all in.  The sound editing, the visual effects, everything about this film is effortlessly maneuvered to linger in the minds of the audience.<br /><br />`Children of Men' is ultimately a film of hope and survival.  It wisely establishes a bleak reality before coming forth with glimmers of a better tomorrow (in fact the boat Kee is trying to reach is rightfully named `Tomorrow').  It cements itself in the hearts of the audience so much so that it draws on raw emotions.  There are moments that brought me to tears especially as the film comes to its climax.  Being a new parent I was moved deeply by this film, a film that proved what we all know, that children are our future, our only future and without them life is not worth living.</p></body></html>

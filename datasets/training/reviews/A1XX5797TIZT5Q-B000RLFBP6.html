<meta name="summary" content="Great bonus material, but..."></head><body><p>A couple of words on this DVD edition.<p>Though this is the &quot;director's cut&quot; of the film, I find the theatrical version superior.  The excised material is extremely violent, but that's not why  they don't work as well -- after all, ultraviolence is a motif in this  film.  The extra two, three shots of &quot;Mr. Kinney' being shot even  after he's sprawled on the table are actually funny (if excessively gory),  but the Murphy death scene is actually hurt by the extra material.  The  original scene was already highly arresting; the extra shots of Murphy  screaming, his arm being blown off, and the loving close-up on the hand  actually took some of the momentum from the sequence (while upping the  sadistic factor).  The worst part, though, is that the extra shots of  Murphy's shooting pointed out the poor sound editing in the sequence:  During the reaction shots on Emil, Clarence and Joe, you don't hear  Murphy's moans, making the shots on Murphy and the shots on the crooks seem  like they're in two different worlds.  And the virtuoso 180-degree dolly on  Murphy before Clarence shoots him in the head?  That slowed down the pace  and didn't offer much that was new.<p>Other than that (thankfully the  &quot;restored footage&quot; only applied to two scenes), this DVD edition  is great -- with Criterion's usual care for production history, commentary  tracks (Verhoeven and Neumeier sound awfully interesting, pointing out the  potential &quot;silliness&quot; of the script in its development stages),  and extra options, you can't lose.  I *did* experience two glitches when I  got this DVD, but hopefully those weren't across-the-board defects that  occur on every copy.</p></body></html>

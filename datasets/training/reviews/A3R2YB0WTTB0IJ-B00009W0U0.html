<meta name="summary" content="ROB ZOMBIE, OPUS 1"></head><body><p>**** 2003. Written and directed by Rob Zombie. Four young people lose their way and drive finally to the Firefly's, a family of vicious killers. Rob Zombie's first movie deserves our utmost attention as it reveals a true filmmaker that will confirm his skill four years later with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VKL6ZC">Halloween (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>. Highly recommended."</p></body></html>

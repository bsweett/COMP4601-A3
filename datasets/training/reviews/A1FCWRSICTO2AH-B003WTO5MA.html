<meta name="summary" content="A bad remake"></head><body><p>I like horror flicks.  So I was looking forward to seeing the remake of "The Amityville Horror."  It's a pretty simple formula: haunted house with secret(s), unsuspecting family, things start getting weird, etc.  The original 1979 version had a certain cheesy charm, but not enough to bar a remake.  Well, I was wrong.  The new "Amityville," is a really bad movie that makes the older version seem better than it actually was.  And it can't even stick with the original (no floating pig eyes outside the second story window!), but goes poaching on "The Shining," "Poltergeist," and other post 1979 horror efforts.  What a mess.  The movie does establish that actor Ryan Reynolds (George Lutz in the film) has got an impressive six pack - which is, I suppose, something when you can't act.  Seriously, there's very little character development, and as a result there is little real horror generated.  It's hard to care about these people.  The kids are good. - especially actor Jesse James, playing conflicted 12 year old Billy Lutz.  But their parents, as played by George and Reynolds, hardly rise above walking talking manikins.  Maybe Romero could use them for his next "Dead" movie. The net result has me wanting the 1979 version with a hammy Rod Steiger, a moody James Brolin and a screaming Margot Kidder, and lots of flies.  Oh, and a creepy house with "eyes" that stars.</p></body></html>

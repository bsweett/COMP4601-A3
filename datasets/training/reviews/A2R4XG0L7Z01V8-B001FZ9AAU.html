I'm one of the many who probably hasn't read the comic books. And as a smart person said when we were sitting in a (very packed) cinema, 95% of the people in the cinema wouldn't have read the comic books either.<br /><br />So what did I know about Iron Man? Well, from the endless photos of Gwyneth Paltrow looking gorgeous, wearing very short skirts, and very high heels, in the press, I guess that she has a small role in it? I didn't see any photos of Robert Downey Jnr promoting the movie, it all seemed to focus on Gwyneth's very long legs.<br /><br />From the impressive beginning, you know that Iron Man is going to work. Although the VFX do feel similar at times to Transformers (done by the same company, Industrial Light & Magic, don't you know), it succeeds where Spiderman 3 spectacularly failed. Not only is Robert perfect for the Tony Stark/Iron Man role, he's cute as well. Hello!<br /><br />The story is basically like this: Tony Stark is CEO of Stark Industries, which produces really hi-tech weapons for the military. After his father's death, Tony inherited the company, and is now a billionaire. He has a fancy house, and a love for women. Who he then gets his assistant to throw out once he's finished with them. When in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new weapons test, his convoy is attacked, and he is injured, and taken hostage, but his life is saved by a doctor. When the terrorists force Tony to reproduce the weapon, he builds an impressive suit of armour, and escapes. The suit gets destroyed but is rebuilt in the US, where it gives Tony what else, but superhuman strength. He wants revenge.<br /><br />The special effects & technology used in this movie will absolutely blow you away. I mean, wow! It's absolutely breath taking. I'm not going to ruin this movie for anyone who hasn't yet seen it, but go, go, go! The action scenes in themselves are unreal. Not only do they work, but they take your breath away.<br /><br />The supporting cast was amazing. Gwyneth played the part for Pepper really well, and even managed to run a little in skyscraper heels. How does she manage it? I can barely walk in heels never mind run. Terrence Howard I have a feeling might get a bigger role hopefully in the next movie, it's certainly hinting that way. Jeff Bridges as the bad guy was unbelievable. The bald head really gave me the creeps, and gave the character an extra something. He's a seriously unlikeable character, and makes you root for Tony even more. And for all those reviewers who have complained that Samuel L Jackson is listed in the cast, but doesn't appear - hello duh??? I'll give you a hint. His scene was not left on the cutting room floor. He does appear. You just have to find the fast forward button. Put it this way, there will definitely be a sequel.<br /><br />I cannot wait to get this movie on DVD. Hopefully, it will be two discs (no bare bones DVDs for me!), loaded with extras and I want LOADED!!! I want to know how they did this, how they did that, and I want to see Robert in training. Woohoo. They can go all out with the extras on this DVD so lets hope they do.<br /><br />All I can say is go see this movie. You will not regret it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="How people live with fear"></head><body><p>Radio announcer Erica Bain (Foster) had the perfect life.  Her show's going great.  She loves her fiancee, Dr. David Kirmani (Naveen Andrews).  Then they are attacked one night in the park while walking their dog by a vicious band of street punks.  Erica awakens from a coma after three weeks to discover that David's family had to let him go while she was unconscious.<br /><br />She's afraid to walk the streets anymore, even the most innocent passerby makes her wary.  So, she buys an illegal gun.  Next, she takes up smoking.<br /><br />A friend tells her she's got to figure out a way to life.  That's the hard thing. The story tells how fear changes a person and makes them wonder if they will ever be the same again.<br /><br />Erica starts out innocently enough, defending herself against a robber who killed his wife. Next, it's a pair of punks in the subway who rob an innocent person and then pull a gun on her.<br /><br />Almost every person who's been hurt has wanted to seek vengeance in some way.  The dream is a lot harsher than the reality.  "The Brave One" is painful to watch, but it's worthwhile.  Jodie Foster's given the best performance of a life full of strong performances.  Also, kudos to Terence Howard as Detective Mercer.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, September 2008</p></body></html>

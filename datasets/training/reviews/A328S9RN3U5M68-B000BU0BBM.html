More the Opposite!"></head><body><p>Few complain when writers and directors take a fresh take on an old story: at times the new approach even enhances the original. Sadly, that is not the case with THE BROTHERS GRIMM.  Though Terry Gilliam is well recognized as one who makes magic out of old things retold, this time the magic seems to have been concentrated on costumes, weird head pieces, claustrophobic haunted villages, and animated effects. As a result the story is left behind and without a decent script, leaves little for the actors to mold into anything.<br /><br />This telling of the Brothers Grimm is more grim than fantastical.  Instead of fairytale writers, these misanthropes are snake oil salesmen out to purge villages of their demons (all a part of show that pays them well).  Matt Damon and Heath Ledger are the wily two and try their best to make the story happen. Interspersed in the derring-do are snippets of the fairytales that came from the imagination of the brothers and they serve as sidebars of some interest, albeit distorted versions, intensely altered versions of Hansel and Gretel, Little Red Ridinghood, etc.<br /><br />There is a reason this film took so long to make and ran up high production costs: the production company was trying to make it work and failed.  Mildly entertaining but hardly worth the long hours it seems to take to tell it.  Grady Harp, December 05</p></body></html>

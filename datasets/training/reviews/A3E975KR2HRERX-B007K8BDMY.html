<meta name="summary" content="Glorifying a deluded man..."></head><body><p>Edited: I'm going to admit one thing. Werner Herzog is an amazing man and I in a small way now understand why he made this movie. After watching more of his works like 'Little Dieter needs to Fly', I've come to the reasons of why he does this types of movies. I'm giving this three stars now for knowing who the Director is and NOT because of that story of a Deluded man-boy who by his own actions killed a women for his pride.<br /><br />The man within this movie was real. That is the only truth within that is undeniable, but to place such praise on this one individual who "fought the man" to protect one single animal that was never endangered was ludicrous from the very start. Soulful music and "grand" over-reaching narration does not make ones' tale epic. So driven was this man that he ignored all those danger signs about a Wild Animal and while he himself was narrating his "sad" tale he was attacked and mauled by the very animal he believed he was protecting. How do I know this? Because his recorder was still on while the bear was Tearing him apart.<br /><br />(REDACTED)<br /><br />No. It as I wrote before, glosses over his end with a tragic soulful farewell speech about how "noble" this deranged person was and that what his activities where truly for...<br /><br />(REDACTED)<br /><br />Remember that if you decide to buy this video.</p></body></html>

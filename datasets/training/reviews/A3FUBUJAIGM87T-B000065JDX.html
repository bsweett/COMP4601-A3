<meta name="summary" content="0 STARS:  Bloody awful rotten garbage!!!"></head><body><p>I truly hate this movie called "From Dusk Till Dawn"...it is horrible!!!  What a loser of a vampire movie this was.  "From Dusk Till Dawn" is about as terrible as a flick can get.  I can only reluctantly write a review about this trash, but if it will save some real horror movie fans' money, I guess I will have to do it.  This movie has Quentin Tarratino's hands all over it and I was apprehensive about it from that standpoint, but when I actually sat down and watched this stinking garbage, I just rolled my eyes and suffered through one of the worst vampire movies ever made.  Here's the bottom line: if you are looking for rotten garbage, buy this DVD...but, on the other hand, if you are looking for a good horror movie or a good vampire movie, avoid this like the plague that it is.  I'm not going to rehash this absurdity of a plot, but I will say that it involves a group of people that end up going to some ridiculous strip club that is full of vampires...yes, I know that the storyline is ridiculous, and the acting is average and that does include Mr. Clooney. Basically, this movie turns out to be an outrageous gorefest signifying NOTHING and with STUPID and cheesey comedy...it's not scary whatsoever or even remotely intelligent.  Ladies and gentlemen, this movie is a total joke!!  If you are a sophisticated and intelligent horror movie fan, you should STAY AWAY from this trash...you'll thank me later.</p></body></html>

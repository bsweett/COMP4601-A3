<meta name="summary" content="Not your father's Narnia"></head><body><p>More than a thousand years after the end of the first film, Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes), the rightful heir of Telmarine, flees for his life from his usurping uncle (Sergio Castellitto) and makes common cause with the remnants of the Narnians, who live hidden in the forest.  When they call for help, the four Pevensies (Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley, and Anna Popplewell) are magically summoned from England to resume their roles as the defenders of Narnia.<br /><br />Those who have read C.S. Lewis's gentle parables may be jarred by the shift in atmosphere.  This is a dark, grim, and scary film, which didn't bother me but may give some parents pause.  I enjoyed the scenes of court intrigue among the nobles of Telmarine, but children would probably be bored.  There are some very lengthy and violent battle scenes that were glossed over in the novel but take up the lion's share of screen time here.  These are not necessarily criticisms, just warnings to those who expect director Andrew Adamson and his co-scripters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely to remain true to the spirit of the books.  I found this film to be overlong but exciting.</p></body></html>

The ads for "Watchmen" promised a visually stunning superhero movie, and while it certainly delivers in that respect, I never imagined that it would also be such a complex, thought-provoking morality play, one that takes plenty of time to develop the characters into people we can actually invest in. I suppose I could have known this ahead of time had I read the original graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, but to tell the truth, I didn't even know of its existence until the summer of 2008. No matter--the film is a work of art unto itself, not merely in terms of its look, but also in terms of its attention to character and its willingness to tackle weighty political and social issues. The tradeoff is a plot that's often very difficult to follow, mostly because, at a hefty 163 minutes, there's a lot of story being told.<br /><br />It's a story that takes place in New York City in 1985. Not the actual 1985, mind you, but a 1985 in an alternate reality, one in which Richard Nixon has just been elected for a fifth term as President. Even though superheroes are commonplace, they're all mere human beings, which is to say that they have no actual superpowers. At a time when the United States and the Soviet Union are engaged in a heated nuclear battle, superheroes, also known as Watchmen, are seen more as vigilantes, and it isn't long before their actions are outlawed. Despite having disappeared from the public eye, it seems there's a conspiracy against the Watchmen, who are now being murdered one by one. Kick starting the story is the murder of Edward Blake, a.k.a., The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan); this reunites the remaining Watchmen, who take it upon themselves to solve the mystery of his death.<br /><br />Most of the film is built around in-depth character analyses, which gradually help to explain why these people are the way they are. The Comedian, for example, is so named because, from his perspective, life is all one big joke. Having been commissioned by the American government to assist in certain operations, he's cynical and world-weary, pretty much to the point of hostility. It would be too much to say that we're made to care for him; we see him do some pretty reprehensible things, none of which I'll describe. We are, however, made to understand where he's coming from. At a certain point, he finds that he's no longer laughing at how much of a joke life is.<br /><br />There are many other characters. There's Laurie Juspeczyk, a.k.a., Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman), whose troubled mother, the original Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino), had ... an encounter with The Comedian many years ago. There's Daniel Dreiberg/Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), a technically savvy retired superhero, whose "basement" is an abandoned subway station filled with various machines. There's Walter Kovacs/Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), the only Watchman to continue his pursuit of vigilante justice. Appropriately, his cloth mask is decorated with inkblots that continuously shift around, and as is the case with a real Rorschach test, he sees only what he wants to see in the world around him. There's Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), the only Watchman who has publicly revealed his identity. It's said on a few occasions that he's the world's smartest man.<br /><br />The most fascinating character is Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), the only Watchman who has actual superpowers. His story is definitely one for the comic books; he began life as mild-mannered nuclear scientist Dr. Jon Osterman, but as the result of a lab accident, his body and mind were transformed, allowing him to exist beyond mortal notions of space and time. His voice is distinctly human, but his body is a glowing-blue spectacle made of light and energy. Even though he uses his abilities to assist the American government in its efforts against the Soviet Union, it's obvious that he has drifted apart from the rest of humanity. It's easy to see why--joining with the very fabric of the universe must make life as we know it seem awfully insignificant. He makes this point on the surface of Mars, where he unearths a towering sphere of crystalline gears, all of which rotate in very clock-like patterns.<br /><br />And yet, there's the sense that some part of him, however small, is still human. Consider the fact that, even though he appears mostly in the nude, he always dresses in a suit for important events, like press interviews. How is it that a being from another plane of existence would have even a modicum of humility?<br /><br />As we near the end of the film, an ethical dilemma is presented, challenging the audience as well as the characters. What it basically boils down to is: Is there a point at which peace comes at too high a cost? You be the judge. All I can say is that it's a fitting question for a film this well crafted, not merely on a technical level, but on a narrative level, as well. It's an ambitious superhero fable that surges with action, drama, and humor, at times brutally violent, at times contemplative, always staying fresh and exciting. It's always risky making a film adaptation, and admittedly, I was worried that "Watchmen" would follow in the footsteps of films like "Silent Hill," which was only understood and appreciated by fans of the original video game. Speaking as someone who hasn't read the graphic novel, I'm happy to say that "Watchmen" is not elitist entertainment. Not bad for something that was once considered unfilmable.</p></body></html>

Thinking it would be a politically correct history lesson, I was happy to find it has a compelling story, as well as a striking portrayal.  While recent nominee, Forest Whitaker, as the self-titled bloody dictator, Idi Amin, has been justly heralded, the whole movie is effective and includes other fine performances.<br /><br />It all starts in 1970 in Scotland where Nicholas Garrigan (James Mc Avoy--remember him as Mr. Tumnus in 'Narnia'?) becomes a doctor with glowing admiration from his doctor father.  Rebelling against the mold as many of his generation, he spins the globe to give himself the fate of going to Uganda.  There he immediately makes a big impression, even at first making a dent at the local clinic.  He's come at a crucial time when a military general has taken over the government.  He and his love interest, Sarah (Gillian Anderson), go to one of Amin's speeches.  They leave early, but are diverted to meet the charismatic leader after he has hurt his hand in an auto accident.  Helpful from the first, Nicholas is summoned to become Amin's personal physician.  He declines at first, wanting to be the humanitarian he came to be, but, after a party and a series of assignments, he can no longer refuse.  Amin was a polygamist with many children from each wife. After healing a boy after an epileptic fit, Nicholas becomes a top aide.<br /><br />What's so effective about how director Kevin Mc Donald unfolds the story is that, even knowing Amin's history, the brutal nature of his bloody regime reveals itself as if for the first time.  McAvoy's performance puts us in the driver's seat, and from there we get conflicting evidence.  There's a harrowing scene as Amin's enemies fire at Nicholas and the tyrant in Nich's newly acquired car.  Then, there's the nature of Amin himself.  He is so funny and affable--such a likable host, we briefly forget that he's a dictator.  In one scene he has a double as himself play a practical joke on Nicholas.  (The jokes are more unnerving than his temperamental side, for it has us holding our breath for the other shoe to drop.)  His generosity toward Nicholas make him seem so human.  That is until we start to see his paranoid and fickle side slowly develop.  In the meantime, Nicholas is approached by a British official, Nigel (Simon McBurney), who seems to be steeped in his own self-interest...even though eventual mounting evidence supports his claims.  He also develops a dangerous alliance with Kay (Kerry Washington), one of Amin's wives.  Between his slowly growing knowledge and some unmentioned missteps, Nicholas is sitting on a ticking time bomb.  Harrowing, but more thoughtful than most chase movies, 'The Last King of Scotland' is a sharp and skillful reinenactment of a dark chapter of history.</p></body></html>

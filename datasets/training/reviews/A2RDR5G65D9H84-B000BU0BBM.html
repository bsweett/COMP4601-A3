<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining fantastic tale with a nice dose of satire"></head><body><p>A few days ago I finally decided to get a new TV. I went for a 1080p LCD and a Blu-Ray player to go with it, and as soon as I got these I wanted to get a movie to try out the 1080p definition.  This film seemed like a good choice, since I thought that the colors and characters of a fantastic story would allow the player to showcase its qualities. I really did not expect the plot to be all that great, but that was not what I was interested in at the time.<br /><br />The quality of the image was absolutely breathtaking, and superior to a couple of other Blu-Ray movies I have watched afterwards. But what was even more surprising was that the story was actually pretty good. The film immerses us in a town in the Germany of the early nineteenth century. But this is a fictional Germany, which is occupied by France, and in which we find a town next to an enchanted forest. The brothers Grimm are con artists that go from village to village feeding people's fears and charging them for eliminating the evil spirits. Running into the real thing is a rude awakening.<br /><br />If you enjoy fairy tales, this movie will keep you entertained throughout its duration, with an amusing story, satiric elements connected to famous fairy tales, and beautiful scenery. The performances of Damon and Ledger are actually pretty good. Even though it is hard to play roles that are a little "silly", these actors do a decent job at it. That is not the case with Peter Stormare, who plays the role of Cavaldi, an evil torturer who has a change of heart after meeting the brothers. Stormare is absolutely outstanding in his role, and leaves a long lasting impression.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to adults that enjoy fairy tales. But beware; this is not a movie to watch with your small children, mainly because in the same vein as the actual stories from the Grimm brothers, there are some scenes that may be too scary for little ones.</p></body></html>

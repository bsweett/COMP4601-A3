<meta name="summary" content=""Moon" is brilliant!"></head><body><p>"Moon" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: It is the near future. Astronaut Sam Bell is living on the far side of the moon, completing a three-year contract with Lunar Industries to mine Earth's primary source of energy, Helium-3. It is a lonely job, made harder by a broken satellite that allows no live communications home. Taped messages are all Sam can send and receive. Thankfully, his time on the moon is nearly over, and Sam will be reunited with his wife, Tess, and their three-year-old daughter, Eve, in only a few short weeks. Finally, he will leave the isolation of "Sarang," the moon base that has been his home for so long, and he will finally have someone to talk to beyond "Gerty," the base's well-intentioned, but rather uncomplicated computer. Suddenly, Sam's health starts to deteriorate. Painful headaches, hallucinations and a lack of focus lead to an almost fatal accident on a routine drive on the moon in a lunar rover. While recuperating back at the base (with no memory of how he got there), Sam meets a younger, angrier version of himself, who claims to be there to fulfill the same three year contract Sam started all those years ago. Confined with what appears to be a clone of his earlier self, and with a "support crew" on its way to help put the base back into productive order, Sam is fighting the clock to discover what's going on and where he fits into company plans.<br /><br />The cast led by Sam Rockwell (in a career-best performance as Sam Bell) is excellent! The directing by Duncan Jones (who also wrote the story) (who also directing the upcoming "Source Code" (2011) is brilliant! The story by Jones & the screenplay by Nathan Parker is brilliant!<br /><br />The music by Clint Mansell (who also did the music to "Requiem For A Dream" (2000), "The Fountain" (2006) & "The Wrestler" (2008), which were directed by Darren Aronofsky) is brilliant! The cinematography by Gary Shaw is brilliant! The film editing by Nicolas Gaster (who also did the film editing to the upcoming "Welcome To The Rileys" (2010) is brilliant! The casting by Manuel Puro & Jeremy Zimmerman is brilliant! The production design by Tony Noble is brilliant! The art direction by Hideki Arichi (who is one of the set designers to the upcoming "Robin Hood" (2010) & Josh Fifarek (who also did the set decoration to "Mulholland Dr." (2001) is brilliant! The costume design by Jane Petrie (who also did the costume design to "28 Weeks Later" (2007) is brilliant!<br /><br />This is a brilliant and impressive sci-fi thriller that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat. This is a brilliant debut for Duncan Jones and a career-best performance for Sam Rockwell, thus far. The visual effects are impressive. This is one of the best films of last year.</p></body></html>

I think it's a fine screen adaptation of the Stan Lee/Jack Kirby Marvel comic. (But it's not very much like the TV series with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, so maybe that's why it's getting such negative reactions.)<p>For comic-book geeks like me who were born in the early 1960s and grew up reading Marvel Comics (waaaaay cooler than DC), the last decade or so has been like a wet dream come true. Finally, the geeks have grown up and figured out ways to make possible _on the screen_ what those writers and artists used to do _on the page_. And filmmakers have already driven the Superman and Batman franchises into the ground, so they're finally getting around to the _good_ comics.<p>Well, it's going to take some doing to beat the X-Men and Spider-Man films, and I don't think this one is _quite_ up to that level. But I can't imagine why any reader of the Hulk comics would find it disappointing.<p>Stan Lee _always_ envisioned the Hulk as a combination of Jekyll/Hyde and Frankenstein. _Both_ of those stories are dark tales of scientific hubris and the horror it can wreak.<p>This screenplay and Ang Lee's direction take this film in precisely that direction (with some nanotech updates), and _of course_ the introductory exposition and development take some time. I don't think it's overlong; I think it's just right. (Granted, if you popped in the DVD just to watch an angry guy turn green, you may be a little impatient. But I don't see that as Ang Lee's fault.) The misuse-of-science theme is nicely sustained throughout the film (Glenn Talbot works for 'Atheon'; hee hee) and there's some genuine suspense as we s-l-o-w-l-y learn what was really happening in all those flashbacks.<p>Eric Bana is right on the money as the tortured and repressed Dr. Bruce Banner; Nick Nolte is pitch-perfect as his brilliant but deranged father David Banner; Jennifer Connelly is Jennifer Connelly; and the rest of the cast are in good form as well.<p>The CGI Hulk is -- no pun intended -- groundbreaking. I suppose if I really wanted to pick nits I could do it, but come on; this is pioneering motion-picture technology, and it's amazingly well done. (Ten years ago this stuff couldn't be done at all, and now we're complaining because some of us can _tell_ it's CGI? As opposed to what? A fifteen-foot-tall green actor?)<p>And real comics fans can have fun spotting the little references to the Marvel series. (Bruce _and_ David Banner? Bruce _Krenzler_? This stuff is nicely handled, if not exactly retconned, in the screenplay.)<p>I'd probably subtract half a star for a couple of slow spots, a little overuse of that comic-bookish splitscreen stuff, and some confusing action at the end. All in all, this film isn't quite as crisp and clear as the excellent X-Men films. But it most definitely partakes of That Ol' Marvel Spirit, and in particular it exemplifies Marvel's trademark ability (also exemplified in the X-Men films) to make the viewer empathize with the 'outcast' under attack from the 'real humans'.<p>If you want Bill Bixby, go watch an old episode of _The Courtship of Eddie's Father_. This is a terrific movie.</p></body></html>

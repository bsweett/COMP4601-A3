<meta name="summary" content="Gotham City"></head><body><p>This new DVD edition should definitely replace your old Batman DVD or, God forbid, VHS tape.  There are hours of bonus features included, mostly done in documentary format.  All angles are covered on the 2nd disc.  Beginning with the original Batman creator, Bob Kane, through the lengthy history of Batman, to the ultimate cinematic adaptation by Tim Burton, who also speaks at great length about the production of the film.  This is very interesting material that a fan will truly appreciate.<br /><br />This movie spoke for itself at the box office.  The combination of Tim Burton's vision and direction, impeccable casting and wonderful special effects took the movie world by storm and reached far beyond the silver screen.  For a while there, you couldn't look anywhere without seeing the Batman logo.  They did some job marketing this movie...<br /><br />I still feel this is the best Batman movie.  Points can be made in favor of the most recent Batman Begins, but having no precursor, Burton's Batman set the stage wonderfully to begin the modern Batman film-making era.  After all, it seems people have granted such praise to Batman Begins, in part, for how it represents a return to the "darkness" of the original.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Cleric"></head><body><p>Equilibrium sheds light on human civilization following WWIII with efforts under way to prevent WWIV.  Having (barely) survived yet another world war, humanity has placed its hopes on a strict regime that forces drugs on the citizens in an effort to suppress all feelings (thus doing away with hate and aggression).  To implement law and order, and oversee the administration of the drugs, the state's leadership relies on the services of a special kind of enforcers known as the Clerics.  One such Cleric, however, will discover that what he's been fighting against might just be worth saving...<br /><br />Christian Bale, Sean Bean (from LOR), Angus Macfadyen (from Braveheart), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!<br /><br />There are strong hints of 1984 and Brave New World as well as the Matrix, Aeon Flux, Ultraviolet, and V for Vendetta so the movie falls into the sci-fi/action/adventure/mystery type of category.<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the music, the battle sequences, and the special effects are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, Equilibrium will surely provide for an evening's entertainment, as it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over!</p></body></html>

Guillermo Del Toro ("Devil's Backbone," "Cronos") attempts to do just that with his concurrent stories of Franco Spain, 1944 and a child's dream world, fable mirroring the realistic part of the film in the fairy tale form though Del Toro never makes it explicitly clear if Ofelia's world is only in her mind or if her world has a place alongside the real.<br />Ivana Baquero as Ofelia is a bookish young 10 year old. Her vibrant eyes are full of wonder as she accompanies her pregnant mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil) into the Pyrenees to meet her Mother's new husband (the multi-lingual Sergi Lopez as a nasty, despotic Captain Vidal in Franco's army) and to wait for the birth of her mother and Vidal's child.<br />Vidal has been sent to this remote place to put an end to a small army of freedom fighters/rebels who oppose Franco. Lopez's Vidal is so vile and cruel that we are made to wonder how beautiful, kind, loving Carmen would have married him much less deigned to have his child but this is never explained. When Carmen goes into labor, Vidal tells the doctor that if a life or death choice is to be made, the doctor is to choose the child over Carmen. Vidal also proves to be the only one who goes over to the other fairy tale side of this film. And as such he arrogantly stains and mutilates Ofelia's world of Fauns and Fairies.<br />"Pan's Labyrinth" is very dark, both production-wise and thematically. When Ofelia descends into the Labyrinth she is not going to a better, kinder, light-filled place but a place fraught with mystery and reeking of the dark. In essence then she goes from the darkness into a darker place which turns the mood of the film topsy turvy particularly if you think about other similarly themed films: "The Wizard of Oz'" going from black and white Kansas to full Technicolor Oz and Alice's descent into the wonder of "Wonderland." And this is key as you try to unlock some of the mysteries of this dazzling film: in order to know the light you must know the dark is how "it" usually goes...but not here.<br />Though seemingly simple on the surface, "Pan's Labyrinth" is anything but.</p></body></html>

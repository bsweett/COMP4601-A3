It's a not unfamiliar story, where a chemical weapon produces horrific results, with a band of survivors battling to stay alive.<br /><br />The strong cast is led by Rose McGowan who takes on the physically demanding role of Cherry.  Freddy Rodriguez is the mysterious Wray, a man with an assortment of deadly skills.  Michael Biehn, Josh Brolin, Marley Shelton, Naveen Andrews, Jeff Fahey, Tom Savini, and Michael Parks, all excel at playing some rather unusual characters.  Topping it off are appearances by Bruce Willis, and Mr. Tarentino himself, as dedicated military men on very different missions.<br /><br />There is a wealth of information in Rodriguez's commentary track, and the bonus materials on Disc 2.  John Carpenter is repeatedly mentioned as an influence.  Casting was done with a minimal script, and Rodriguez then finished the screenplay, writing with the actors that he had cast in mind.  The decision to make Cherry a dancer, and open the film boldly with her performing on stage, is a character embellishment that many will appreciate, as Ms. McGowan certainly has the moves down.  The reasons for using the `missing reel' ploy are explained, and though it jumps the action to the middle of a firefight, whether it makes for a `better' story is open to discussion.  The feature '10 Minute Film School' reveals how many of the special effects were accomplished.  Other featurettes highlight the cast, including some unlikely members from Rodriguez's real life.  It's not mentioned, but when Cherry has a minigun attached to her leg, it appears that more of her real leg remains than was previously shown.<br /><br />The film was shortened to make it more suitable for the theatrical release.  This expanded version contains some additional scenes that fill in a few of the gaps.  Some may feel that an incompletely developed story, detracts a bit from the film's luster, while for others it may not be an issue.  Either way, Planet Terror gets mostly positive marks as a fun film, with some cool action scenes, and the machine gun legged Cherry is hard to forget.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Moby Dick revisited... so much more than "gore!""></head><body><p>"Gore" is the least interesting thing about this film. It's the humorous and believable characters that compel the story.<br /><br />The sheriff fearful of the water! The preppy marine authority! The old salt fisherman traumatized by his past... another "Ahab."<br /><br />The dog and cat chase between these three characters and the monster shark will have you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />The John Williams score is brilliant... who among us hasn't mimiced the "shark approach" tune on occasion?<br /><br />This film is timeless.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel "the Shroud of Torrington."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Avoid This "Fog" and Go for the Original"></head><body><p>Carpenter must be very hard up for money as that would have to be the only reason he would ever let someone remake his classic.  Like a number of his films, the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AM6OQ2">The Fog</a> failed to find an audience until being released on VHS/DVD where it is now considered something of a classic.  It had one of the best atmospheric direction jobs I can ever recall.  How could anyone think they could improve upon this film is a mystery to me.  Steer clear of this fog and go buy or rent Carpenter's original.</p></body></html>

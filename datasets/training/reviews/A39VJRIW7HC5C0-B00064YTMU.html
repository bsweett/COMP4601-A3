<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly Formulaic"></head><body><p>Although the phrase "I don't see what all the fuss is about" will no doubt earn me scores of non-helpful votes from fans of the film, I must say that I was surprised at the reception received by this film.  Beyond the solid direction, there's very little original territory here.<br /><br />I must say that I knew nothing about this movie when I walked in.  I did not know that Tom Cruise was the villain, something that people have payed way too much attention to.  If they cast Michael Jackson as a missionary it doesn't make it neccesarily a good film.  Similarly, casting Jamie Foxx as a non-comedian is no bolder than casting rap stars on Law and Order Special Victims Unit.  Casting two actors agaisnt type won't overcome a hackneyed script.<br /><br />Is there any doubt that Jamie Foxx will survive this movie?  Is there ever a question that he will be reunited with Jada Pinkett Smith by the climax of the film?  Is there any reason to have the cop-who-knows-there's-more-to-the-story-but-his-fellow-cops-won't-beleive-him?  There is nothing original here, and solid performances and superb direction by Mann don't elevate this beyond a standard thriller.  5/10</p></body></html>

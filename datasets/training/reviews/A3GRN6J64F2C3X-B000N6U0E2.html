It was also a little strange to see brokerage employees as heartwarming guys who want to see Will's down-on-his-luck Chris Gardner character succeed.  But I guess the movie gets a few points for unpredictability on that score.  Generous extra features give us a look at the real-life Chris Gardner, the novelty of Will Smith working with his young son Jaden, and the amusing situations arising from the film's Italian director- Gabriele Mucchino- not being able to speak very good English.  I definitely enjoyed "The Pursuit of Happyness" (despite the title's annoying and intentional spelling error), but to part company with several of my fellow Amazon reviewers, I can't say it's one to write home about.  Crisp, sharp image and excellent sound on the DVD, though.</p></body></html>

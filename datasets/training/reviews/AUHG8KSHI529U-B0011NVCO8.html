<meta name="summary" content="A compelling crime story that never glamorizes crime and let's us see its horrible effects"></head><body><p>While there is a real grit to this film, it is never sensationalistic and does not glorify crime.  This is the story of two real life people, Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts.  Frank Lucas grew up in North Carolina and fled to New York to avoid trouble with the law.  On the streets of Harlem he became the right hand man of a gangster who ruled Harlem under the Italian mafia, Bumpy Johnson.  After Bumpy died, Frank rethought his position in life and what he wanted to do about it.<br /><br />What he decided to do was become the main supplier of Heroin in New York and New Jersey.  He hatched a scheme to go to Vietnam and Thailand and from there into the mountain jungles to buy uncut heroin direct and cut out all the middlemen in the drug trade.  How he got it back to the states is one of the interesting plot points of the movie and if you were alive during those years you probably remember the news stories after he got busted.<br /><br />Along the way, he brings his family up from North Carolina and they build their own drug business that is so effective (the Blue Magic brand heroin they sell is twice as potent at half the price) that the Mafia works out a deal to buy wholesale from him!  Yes, he is ruthless.  Yes, we see the squalor of what his drugs do to people.  Yes, we see the degradation of the women who work to cut and package his dope and have to work naked so they can't steal anything.  We briefly see the brothels, but the way they are shown nothing could be less sexy.  It is all just so sad and filthy.  Unlike the Godfather films, this movie doesn't try to pretend there is nobility and doesn't separate us from where Frank's millions come from.  However, Frank separates himself.  We see scenes of him at Church with his mother, of them holding hands and praying around their Thanksgiving Day meal, and so on.  Frank views himself as just another business man moving a commodity that people want and are going to buy with or without him.  So, he rationalizes, why not cash in.<br /><br />Pursuing Frank is Detective Richie Roberts.  Remember, this was the time of the movie "Prince of the City" and the police force was notoriously corrupt.  This was especially true of the drug squads.  Richie will not take.  He just wants to be an honest cop and this confuses and enrages the crooked cops, but gets him on a team trying to actually go after the big drug dealers.  The death of his former partner who got into heroin gives him a lead to the Blue Magic brand.  You see, the junkies weren't used to the stuff being so potent and there were many deaths from it.  The movie's main plot is how Richie learns about Frank and finally brings him down.  A nice twist in the film that was also a part of real life is that Richie was also going to law school and passed the bar.  So, when it came time to prosecute Frank, Richie did it.<br /><br />The extras disk has a feature that shows the real Richie and Frank and how they are still friends today.  Richie eventually became a defense attorney and worked to defend Frank and get him out of jail after serving 15 years instead of the 70 he was sentenced to.<br /><br />An interesting and honest film that I found quite compelling.  Frank is played by Denzel Washington and Richie is played by Russell Crowe.  They both do superb work.</p></body></html>

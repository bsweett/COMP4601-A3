<meta name="summary" content="Horrifying and INTENSE"></head><body><p>"Dawn of the Dead" is the 2004 remake of the original 1978 classic horror film.<br /><br />THE STORY: When dead people start coming back to life it seems like the end of the world. A group of people (led by Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jack Weber and Michael Kelly) hold up in a shopping mall to survive while the dead increasingly congregate outside. What's going on? What can they do? How can they survive? And is there any hope?<br /><br />Although the basic plot is the same as george Romero's orginal film the characters and storyline are completely different; hence, this is more of a re-envisioning rather than a true remake. Personally I prefer it this way. We already have the original so let's see a different take. No?<br /><br />I just saw this film last night and it was so freakin' horrifying and INTENSE I couldn't sleep for two hours. This, for me, reveals the true effectiveness of a horror flick -- whether or not you can sleep afterwards. In this sense "Dawn" is a 5/5 Star film all the way.<br /><br />What I liked about the story is that it takes the material seriously; there's no, goofy, campy, unrealistic vibe. What would it be like if dead people REALLY started coming back to life and seeking out living flesh to eat? This is the approach the filmmakers take here.<br /><br />One reviewer complained that it was unrealistic that the characters on occasion would laugh, smile and joke around during such a dire, hopeless situation. But this isn't unbelievable at all. It's a natural defensive mechanism of the human psyche to try to have fun, joke and make the most out of a bad situation. I've seen it numerous times in my life and the lives of others over the years (car accident, hospitalization, destruction of property, serious illness, death, etc.). Besides, the film more than adequately portrays the downside of human reaction -- depression, violence, grief, madness, etc.<br /><br />The only negative I can cite is the speeding-up effect used in the Third Act. It worked at times but too often it came across as awkward or amateurish and just served to confuse the viewing experience.<br /><br />Some people didn't like the zombie birth scene but I found it well-done and effective.<br /><br />The original was filmed at the Monroeville Mall near Pittsburgh, PA, while this remake was shot at the (now demolished) Thornhill Square Mall in Ontario, although the story takes place in Milwaukee.<br /><br />The threatrical version runs 101 minutes (the version I saw) and the Director's Cut 110 minutes.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a truly intense, horrifying flick you can't go wrong with this 2004 version of "Dawn of the Dead."</p></body></html>

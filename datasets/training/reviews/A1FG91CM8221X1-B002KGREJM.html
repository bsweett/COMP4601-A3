If there has ever been a cinematic performance that can truly be said to burst out of the screen, it's Whitaker's. His Amin is intensely alive, unpredictable, and terrifying; staring at the other characters with his unreadable, strabismatic gaze, you never know whether he's going to hug or kill them (there's a 50-50 chance between the two). Therefore, it's a surprise when seeing the film for the first time that Amin is not the lead character. It's Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy), a young Scottish doctor who's an amalgam of several Europeans unlucky enough to have been in Uganda in the 1970s. Garrigan, who comes to Uganda on a lark, is fun-loving, well-meaning, vaguely idealistic but with a wobbly moral compass. A chance meeting with Amin leaves Garrigan intoxicated with Amin's powerful charisma and charm; Amin, for his part, is convinced that Garrigan is the miracle-working adviser he's been seeking. Thus begins a toxic relationship in which Garrigan, first naively and then willfully, blinds himself to the obvious warning signs of Amin's true nature. By the time Garrigan finally wakes to Amin's insanity and the hideous carnage of Amin's rule, he finds he has no friends; all those opposed to Amin see Garrigan as Amin's "white monkey," as a British diplomat sneeringly tells Garrigan. Eventually, even Amin passes moral judgment (as well as judgment of another kind) on Garrigan: "Did you ever do anything in your life that is good?" the bloody butcher asks the well-meaning but silly doctor. And that is a judgment, Macdonald implies, that could have been passed on far too many of us in that situation. McAvoy is excellent as Garrigan, but the character's behavior is so stupid at times that you just want to slap him. When Whitaker is on screen, the movie really comes to life. And we, like Garrigan, are seduced.</p></body></html>

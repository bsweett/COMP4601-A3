<meta name="summary" content="A Wild Surprise"></head><body><p>I thought this movie would be complete s**te, being another peurile attempt at resurrecting the waning careers of some has-been stars. In the event, I was surprised to see a movie that not only made me choke with laughter, but also had a very good ending as a bonus.<br /><br />The story follows four surburban Harley riders in the midst of their respective mid-life, boring, surburban lives. They each have nothing to liven up their quickly aging lives except the annual suburb's parade in which they ride their Harleys in formation. Exciting stuff. One of them comes up with the brain wave to take a road trip. A long story short, they all agree to go, and four of them set out for the Pacific U.S. in an adventure that has no plans, and no cellphones.<br /><br />The format was pretty predictable: the four would do something, and something would go wrong. The trick was guessing what went wrong with each new event. The humour is fairly slapstick in nature, though there is a deeper side to it. I have to admit, the deeper side comes in pretty shallow, in all honesty.<br /><br />This is no deep movie, though the critique of mid-life surburban boredom could be a target of the movie's comment. However, the movie is one that will appeal to the most basic of humours, (that is, like myself), and will keep one entertained for the duration. I am not sure it is worth a second or third viewing, but it was sure funny during the first one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding Film on an Outstanding DVD...."></head><body><p>This review refers to the Fox War Classic (20th Cent Fox)DVD(single disc)Edition of "Patton".....<br /><br />A film that recieved nearly as many honors as Patton himself, 8 Academy Awards(including Best Picture,1970, Best Actor and Best Director), among numerous others, Golden Globe and Directors Guild included, now gets the royal treatment from 20th Century Fox. It is a beautiful transfer of this 33 year old film that is a pleasure to watch. The picture in Anamorphic Widescreen(2.35:1), which shows off the beautiful cinematography is incredible.It is clear and sharp with vibrant colors. The choice of sound is 5.1 Dolby or Stereo Surround, and is excellent as well. The dialouge, the music, the sounds of battle all surround you wonderfully. It may be viewed with captions in English or Spanish that appear in the black bar area(although the English subtitles, when the Germans are speaking are in the picture itself).One of the special features is an audio essay that you can choose to run during the film. The speaker is Charles Provence, the President of the Gen. George S. Patton Historical Society, and he presents a total picture of Patton. He speaks about his days as a child, as a young Lt. in the Army and all Patton's amazing accomplishmnets in his lifetime.He also speaks of certain incidences in the film and exactly the way they really happened(i.e. the slapping incident) The essay runs about 1:20 and is highly captivating and informative. Not much else in the way of bonus material, but it does come with a little booklet that  gives Patton's achievements in a time line form. For me the quality of this DVD was bonus enough.<br /><br />The movie itself would be a welcome addition to any history, film or war buff. Director Franklin Schaffner has done an expert and meticulous job of filming a fascinating look at a fascinating man who is such a huge part of our history. Patton's invovlment in WWII, his genius at military tatics and his overwhelming personality are all very much a part of this film. His disdain for "cowards", his admiration of the fighting men, who feared him but proudly fought for him, his obsession for glory, his poetry, his belief in reincarnation, the battles, his adversities and triumphs all make for a captivating story.<br /><br />Geroge C. Scott plays Patton in a way that you would think it was Patton himself on the screen. Karl Malden also turns in a wonderful performance of Gen. Omar Bradley. Karl Michael Vogler(Rommel),Richard Munch(Gen Jodl) and Michael Bates(Montgomery) add their wonderful talents as well. Jerry Goldsmith's score has great feeling and is perfect for this film. The movie was based on material from books by Omar Bradley(A Soldier's Story) and Ladislas Farago(Patton: Ordeal and Triumph).<br /><br />A terrific addition to any film library...<br />Thanks and enjoy...Laurie<br /><br />also recommended:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CC7PR6">A Bridge Too Far</a></p></body></html>

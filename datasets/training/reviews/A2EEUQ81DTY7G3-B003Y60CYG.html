Is he supposed to be funny, or whimsical or perhaps even satirical? Written by Keillor himself and directed by the legendary Robert Altman, A Prairie Home Companion centers on the premise that everyone is about to say goodbye with the final broadcast of the actual old-time radio variety show taking place the Fitzgerald theater in St. Paul, Minnesota.<br /><br />Various artists have come along for the ride: Yolanda Johnson (Meryl Streep) and Rhonda Johnson (Lily Tomlin) are the last remaining members of a musical family whom Yolanda describes to her daughter Lola (Lindsay Lohan) as "the Carter family, only not famous."<br /><br />Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly also make an appearance as a duo of singing cowboys, and a hard-boiled private detective Guy Noir (Kevin Kline) is the story's bumbling and ungainly narrator. While Guy is waiting for the new boss (Tommy Lee Jones) to make an appearance, Guy doesn't know what to make of the apparition in a white trench coat who shows up unannounced, especially when she looks like Virginia Madsen.<br /><br />A Prairie Home Companion is beautifully shot and remarkably cozy and atmospheric, and it has many lovely and funny moments, but there's not a lot going on. Dramatically, it's melodious to the point of torpor. Obviously the film has a folksy and low-key appeal and will probably only really appeal to fans of the radio show.<br /><br />But the film only really comes alive when the various artists sing - including a fabulous Meryl Streep. Of course, Altman uses his usual trademark of the wandering camera, strolling from character to character, pausing to watch and listen as they tease one another, natter on about trivia, reminisce about the old days, worry about the future and partake of flatulence.<br /><br />Everything in this movie just comes across as so old fashioned, from the songs to the stories and  - apart from Meryl - it's all a bit boring. Only the ribald jokes of Dusty and Lefty have a trace of novelty and bawdiness invested in them. Corny and quaint are two words that apply to this movie, but another two words tedious and lackluster could equally be applied.  Mike Leonard October 06.</p></body></html>

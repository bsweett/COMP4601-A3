<meta name="summary" content="Awesome Movie"></head><body><p>Your favorite toys are back in toy story three. toy story three is about what happens when andy goes to collage. I think this movie is great. The original cast is back except Jim Varney(Who Plays Slinky Dog In The first two) R.I.P., and some new cast like the legendary whoopie Goldberg and Michael Keaton who plays Ken. This movie is well made. It is true that it is kind of a sad movie. but i think it needed to be told to conclud the toy story movies. Is this the last? Probably so. well all in all eveybody had a good ride and people will mess these characters. I think alot of people can relate to this movie. Even The villians story was sad, you probably would turn sour if someone left you behind and then you found out that they replaced you. The movie had a great ending even though it was a tearjearker. All in all this movie was awesome and it will be a Disney Classic.</p></body></html>

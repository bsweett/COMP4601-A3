<meta name="summary" content="Such a dignified queen"></head><body><p>Perspective changes with time. Now I can empathsize the Queen. To issue an immediate statement after Princess Diana's death would be irresponsible, an act more suited for a populist cum politician. To be able to stick to her principles (even as it may be out-dated), reflect upon the escalating crisis and do the only thing (not necessarliy the right thing) left to do for the monarchy makes Queen Elizabeth II a truly outstanding soverign. Such is the wonderful script which makes the movie  thought-provoking, warm and intriguing.<br /><br />Helen Mirren is brilliant in her portrayal of the Queen. I especially like her subtlety, her "stubborness" without offending anyone. Instead, she has my complete sympathy. The movie is shot in such a beautiful countryside and full of metaphor. The Queen love the dogs, the deer and may very well be more at ease displaying her emotions toward the animals than towards people. The dialogues may be far from what actually happened but the Queen's personality is wonderfully portrayed.<br /><br />This is really a film that has done justice to the royal family and provides a refreshing angle towards the historical event of Princess Diana's death. Don't miss it.</p></body></html>

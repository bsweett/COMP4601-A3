<meta name="summary" content="The Queen did her Duty"></head><body><p>The Life of a Sovereign is not an easy one. Being Her Majesty demands much. When Elizabeth the Second was crowned in 1952 she was a mere 25. Just a girl she took an oath to God and country that she would serve the British people till death. The Queen covers the period of time when Princess Diana died in Paris in 1997. Helen Mirren gives a stunning portrayal of Elizabeth II (just as she did Elizabeth I)of a monarch whose judgment stirs debate from her subjects.<br /><br />When Princess Diana dies the Royal Family takes the position of keeping it a private matter. The public though has a different idea. Between the Windsors, the general public, and Prime Minister Tony Blair, a week in the life of the Royals in the aftermath of Diana's death ... reveal much about why the Windsors are the way they are ... and why Diana's shadow in death still outshined them all.<br /><br />An interesting look into the role of duty, tradition, and obligation of the British throne.</p></body></html>

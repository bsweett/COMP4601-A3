His films, conceptually, always seem to want to convey a deeper message, meaning or metaphor. This is welcomed for me, but this film, Lady in the Water was a mess. The characters seemed to be created like caricatures, and for me, could not be taken seriously. The film felt 10 hrs long, and the entire film was a garbled mess for me. PQ and AQ clear, but not the best. Technically-4/5. Film 1/5. Ugh.</p></body></html>

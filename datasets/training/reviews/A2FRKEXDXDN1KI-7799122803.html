<meta name="summary" content="Blu-ray: My thought after the film was over was..."Is that it?""></head><body><p>"Alice in Wonderland" is Tim Burton-lite but that will appeal to the young and old, without becoming overly dark or twisted.<br /><br />The 2010 film directed by Tim Burton ("Corpse Bride", "The Nightmare Before Christmas", "Beetlejuice") and a screenplay by Linda Woolverton ("The Lion Queen", "Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey", "Beauty & the Beast") is loosely based on the Lewis Carrol 1903 classic "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland".<br /><br />Featuring a production by Team Todd (The Austin Powers films, "Memento", "Across the Universe"), the 2010 Disney incarnation received a lot of buzz when the announcement was made that the film would feature a reunion of both director Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp but the that the film would feature a cast tat would include Mia Wasikowska, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Crispin Glover, Alan Rickman and many more.  The film would also receive buzz about the creation of the world of Wonderland and the extensive use of CG, especially with its steep production budgeted at around $200 million.<br /><br />Despite receiving reviews that were 50/50 from film critics, there is no denying that a Tim Burton film would bring people to the theaters and in this case, the Burton and Depp mystique would help bring in over $996 million dollars in the box office.  The film would achieve the sixth highest grossing opening weekend of all time and the highest opening weekend for a non-sequel and also surpassing "Avatar" in the IMAX and is currently the highest grossing film of 2010.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />"Alice in Wonderland" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1) and for the most part, "Alice in Wonderland" is a film that showcases a great amount of detail on Blu-ray but in terms of colors, for example, Alice going with her mother for a party, the color seem quite muted (like it's overcast) and I looked at it as a way for the film to show the viewer how Alice was a bit disenchanted with her life.  When she falls into the hole, we notice a different, surreal landscape that was created digitally.<br /><br />In fact, you will see in the special features that a large part of the film was created alongside a green screen, so for the most part, the film is CG-heavy and one can expect gorgeous CG graphics for Wonderland.  Blacks are nice and deep and scenes such as the Red Queen's lair and the use of reds are quite vibrant.  And as mentioned, there is a good amount of detail.  From Mad Hatter's hat to the tea party and more.<br /><br />As for the DVD version that is included with the three-disc Blu-ray release, the DVD is presented in Widescreen 1:78:1 (enhanced for 16?9 televisions).<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />"Alice in Wonderland" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA (48 kHz/24-bit), English 2.0 DVS,  Spanish and French Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  The lossless audio was very well done as the film is quite immersive.  From crowd ambiance, to the smallest noises created by the Red Queen's servants to the thunder clouds approaching nearby, to the galloping horses, the march of the soldiers and more.  Dialogue is crystal clear through the front channels as Danny Elfman's music utilizes the front channels while the surrounds utilize the special effects.  From Alice falling through the hole and hitting various objects to the various characters running from the Red Queen's soldiers and more.<br /><br />"Alice in Wonderland" may not be action-heavy but the 5.1 DTS-HD MA is no slouch either.  Audio is well done for this film and overall, a satisfying, immersive lossless soundtrack.<br /><br />As for the DVD version that is included with the three-disc Blu-ray release, the DVD is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and English 2.0 DVS French and Spanish.<br /><br />As for subtitles, the film is presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"Alice in Wonderland" comes with the following special features (in 1080p High Definition or 480i, Audio in English 5.1 or 2.0 and subtitles in English SDH, French and Spanish):<br /><br />  * WONDERLAND CHARACTERS: (27:56)  This segment contains the following special features:<br /><br />- Finding Alice - The special effects, costume design and more.<br /><br />- The Futterwacken Dance - Futterwhat?

The 3-Disc release comes with a slip cover featuring artwork different than the main cover insert.  Also, the film comes with a DVD version of "Alice in Wonderland" and a Digital Copy.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Tim Burton was able to create a magical world of Wonderland with its characters with the heavy use of CG.  The film was literally filmed with a big green screen all around and people having to wear it while most of the work was then added via post-production in making sure the characters, the scenery and of courts the animals and inhabitants of this world are captured quite well in the film.  So, I had no doubt that the Blu-ray release would look good because mostly everything is CG-driven.<br /><br />"Alice in Wonderland" is a film that was received 50/50 and for the majority of the critics who are familiar with the Lewis Carrol novel, the film was a major deviation from the actual story.  Whereas the novel was about a young Alice who ends up in Wonderland and interacts with the inhabitants of the land including the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the King and Queen and Duchess and literally an adventurous experience of a girl in a new land.<br /><br />As for the Linda Woolverton screenplay, the film is about a young adult Alice who faces adulthood.  Not knowing how to explain her emotions and being asked to take part in a marriage (in which she doesn't love the man), she just wants to escape.  In Wonderland, this escape from reality is where Alice gets to know her true self and learn how to stand up for herself without anyone calling the shots in her life.  Call it a coming-of-age film, "Alice in Wonderland" deals with a young woman not knowing her true strength but when her life and her new friends lives are in danger, she is the only one that can defeat the Red Queen's biggest weapon.  She may not think that it is possible but her brief stay in Wonderland will eventually be an incredible test.<br /><br />Typically, I am a reviewer who tends to find CG-driven films to be quite banal of late.  Granted, "Avatar" was a film that was extremely well-crafted and as for "Alice in Wonderland", I actually enjoyed the world that Tim Burton and staff was able to create. Wonderland may be lush but a CG film can only go so far.  It depends on the characters and its storyline.  And reading a number of reviews, the film was split 50/50 for critics who enjoyed it or those who felt the film was to astray when compared to the original novel or just more eye candy and an unappealing film.<br /><br />Sean P. Menas, film critic for The Salt Lake Tribune wrote, "Burton's overamped, visually frenetic and chaotically action-heavy adaptation of "Alice in Wonderland" manages to be both too much and not enough of what a retelling of Alice should be."<br /><br />I have to agree with Sean P. Menas and that "Alice in Wonderland" is a film that could have been an amazing trilogy if given the chance.  As I pondered about the film, sure, images of "Lord of the Rings" came to mind but it would have been great if there was more to the story of "Alice in Wonderland" because 109 minutes did not seem enough.  And I felt that Tim Burton's storyline was diluted by its pacing of trying to get from point A to point B so quickly that I found myself more in-tuned with Alice's character and Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter was just a creepy character that needed more time.  Even the Cheshire Cat which was so instrumental in the novel was left with very little in the film.<br /><br />Michael Smith of the Tulsa World writes, "A disappointment on a massive scale canvas, Burton's "Alice in Wonderland" is a beautiful, giant bore that's almost comedy-free. It may be of some interest to adults, but kids will be bored to tears, unless they don't listen to the leaden dialogue and imagine they are watching a new video game."<br /><br />Although, I didn't find "Alice in Wonderland" as a giant bore, I found it to be entertaining and felt it was a film that had potential but in the end, making you feel it was OK or good but not fantastic.  I can't call the film a disappointment on a massive scale, especially as it is one of the highest grossing films of all time.  I also feel that with the pairing of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, the films success was facile and if anything, their pairing would lead to financial box office success but I may not be an erudite when it comes to the original novel's storyline but I do feel for the film, the story of "Alice in Wonderland" could have led to more sequels and stretch out the story to make us care for the characters and even Wonderland itself.<br /><br />We are told that Alice has been to the Wonderland many times before, even painting roses for the Red Queen and this is where I find the biggest fault of the film.  The original novel would have served a better first film for "Alice in Wonderland", taking her to adulthood and bringing her back as featured in this film as a sequel.  This would have made sense and a much more engaging film.<br /><br />I did enjoy Mia Wasikowska as Alice.  She fit the part of a young woman trying to find herself and both Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway did a wonderful job playing the queens.  And Johnny Depp, he was wonderful as the Mad Hatter but for each of these three characters, once again, I just felt there was more storyline for these characters that could have been developed.  I felt there was too much emphasis on the glitz and the look of the world while watching a girl who was trying to find her inner strength.  Granted, that was the writer's intention but for all these characters introduced, including the CG animated animals who play a major part in the film, it would have been great to see these characters explored a bit more.  If anything, making the viewer care enough to see them rescued or have created some emotional connect to them.  I just felt the pacing of the film was a bit rushed.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, there is no doubt that "Alice in Wonderland" is a beautiful film with tremendous detail.  The lossless soundtrack is very good.  A good amount of special features and you do get a DVD and digital copy for the 3-disc release.  So, as a total package, its a pretty solid Blu-ray release from Disney.  If you enjoyed the film, you will most definitely enjoy the Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Overall, I was content with "Alice in Wonderland" and I'm sure that both parents and children may find the film entertaining.  Those who are familiar with the original story may feel the storyline's deviance from Lewis Carroll's work to be too much of a difference and for children, for the most part, this is a safe film with not much violent content until the latter end of the film in which Alice goes against the Jabberwocky.  Some parents might find the scene a bit too much for younger children and in that case, parental guidance is suggested.<br /><br />But for me, I felt the film had tremendous potential but missed its target.  Sure, it was a box office success but as  I watched the film alongside with my seven-year-old son, after the film was done, the words that came out of his mouth was  "is that it?"  And like my son, I felt the same way about "Alice in Wonderland"... "is that it?".</p></body></html>

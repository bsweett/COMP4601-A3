<meta name="summary" content="Letting Michael Bay off his leash was a bad idea..."></head><body><p>Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen is one of the most desperate attempts I have ever seen by a movie in its desperate ideas of entertainment. Coming only two years after the release of the first Michael Bay Transformers I knew this movie was not going to be anything special, because a sequel that is pushed into completion within two years is never a good sign. Regardless, I decided to hop over to see this movie after having spent a wonderful time with Pixar's latest release, Up (more on that delightfully entertaining movie some other time).<br /><br />This is the first time I shall really spoil a movie's plot points in a review, because trust me, if you are a rational human being you shall stay clear from this movie knowing its clich&eacute; plot and offensive characters. If you don't want to be spoiled don't read any further, but trust me when I say, even if you enjoyed the fun popcorn film that was Transformers(2007).<br /><br />The movie begins with what we find to be an alliance between the military and the Autobots from the first film as they work together in an attempt to destroy all remaining Deceptacons on the planet Earth. I suppose this was a better idea than simply repeating the exact formula of the first film, but it's just handled very childishly. This entire idea leads up to a huge, explosion filled fight with some sort of giant wheel-bot, that after a few minutes seems to be giving the Autobots the slip (of course in a Michael Bay film a giant robot destroying much of a highway is easy to cover up by the government. Durr-hurr). But what's this? A military cargo plane is flying overhead and heroic music has kicked in! Can it be? My God, it is! Here comes the toy world's most beloved robot character, Optimus Prime! Only problem is that Optimus seems to think he's in a 1980s cop film, because I wouldn't be joking if I say the first thing he tells the tinker-toy from hell after parachuting onto it was " Pull over!" Great! Optimus Prime has now become RoboCop! By the way, get used to one-liners like this- they make up most of the movie's dialogue.<br /><br />The first problem I find in this is that the first film implied that the entire remaining robotic forces of both sides were on Earth and that there were not many others. The way this film is I believe there are THOUSANDS of Decepticons and Autobots still left in reserve and will probably be seen in some giant Lord of the Rings style battle when the third entry comes round, because as bad as this film is it will undoubtedly make a lot of money no matter how bad the word of mouth.<br /><br />The military involvement is vague and they are, as is sci-fi tradition, failing to help in any way! Have you ever once seen a sci-fi/action movie where World domination seeking robots are brought down by machine gun fire? Makes you wonder what the humans are doing here in the first place! They're probably cushions for the robots whenever they fall- don't want those bright paint jobs ruined. Well, that would explain why so many of the robots in this film have red on some part of their paint job.<br /><br />Cut through the opening credits and go to our loving family from the first film. These segments between Sam, his parents, Bumblebee, and Sam's mechanic girlfriend (played by more curves than brains actress Megan Fox) are something that totally turns to movie upside down whenever they occur. No longer are you watching a mindless Rock `Em Sock `Em movie, but you've gone into a sitcom I like to call "That Robot Show." Whether it be Sam's dogs humping each other or his mother randomly getting off on pot-brownies these segments will stoop to anything in vain attempts to make you laugh (as if the absurd action sequences aren't funny enough of a joke). The worst part about this is that there are more of these sitcom scenes than there are actual Robot-versus-Robot moments. I know this is a brainless movie but I would rather see brainless violence than laugh-less "comic" interludes.<br /><br />Speaking of vain attempts at humor let me move right along to perhaps the worst aspect of this entire mess of a film: The Twins. Where to even begin with these unpleasant characters...Throw Jar Jar Binks into a ghetto, blend him up and split him into two and that would sum up how incredibly annoying these characters are, and if their presence wasn't enough to bother you they've made sure to provide you one of the most offensive portrayals of African Americans you will ever see in a big-budget action film. These robots...even their design screams of racist stereotype. One of them has big lips, another has big ears, and one even has a gold tooth (!!). I don't know who approved these characters or this portion of the script during development but surely no rational being could have thought these characters to be a good idea.<br />We also have some shameless rip-off of what appears to be The Terminator as a Deceptacon has taken to form of an attractive girl who seems to have her eyes set on Sam. You know something tells me that if I had the ability to take the form of humans I would use myself in a lot more productive manner than being a tease for college boys at Princeton (which seems to be a party university according to this film).<br /><br />None of the plot really makes sense other than to come up with as many cheesy one-liners and explosions as physically possible. When the bad guys chase Sam they don't pursue, or stalk him- they just choose to blow everything up at random. There is something called tension that even a bad film can pull off, and it does not involve constant wall-to-wall explosions. Go back to the first two Terminator films. Remember how intense it was to have our human characters in a factory where a deadly machine could be anywhere? This didn't involve any explosions, or gunshots, but it sure as hell managed to create tension and edge of your seat moments.<br /><br />This Transformers script came from the writing team of Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, who earlier this Summer movie season also had their names on the incredibly entertaining Star Trek reboot. So what went wrong with them in Transformers 2? Well, Star Trek had some racial stereotypes, and silly jokes, but they never became annoying or offensive to the viewers. Why? I give credit where credit is due, and that was the talent of director J.J. Abrams (Mission Impossible 3, TV's Lost). Unlike Michael Bay, Abrams knew what was worth cutting and what was worth keeping in, and the result was a movie that brought laughs, intense action, whimsical characters, visually stunning special effects, and to top it off it was edited to perfection, running just a bit over two-hours. Transformers 2 seems to have had little to no editing, running at two-hours, thirty-minutes and the director - Bay - seemed so content with what he was doing he never stopped to question what he was doing.<br /><br />The result of Transformers 2 is an overly long, boring movies with very few memorable characters or action sequences...At least 300 had fun action sequences to make up for its absurd, poorly written script- same case with the first Transformers. The action sequences of Transformers 2 are miserable to watch because you can't tell what's going on unless the cheesy slow-motion moments are thrown in (and one even has a bad shot of Optimus being punched in the face and having...PURPLE ROBOT BLOOD fly from his mouth).<br /><br />I'll admit to liking some movies that involve turning your brain down a notch, the first Transformers film being an example of this, but this movie just went too far. At two hours and twenty minutes I thought the first film was forty minutes too long and this sequel is only longer and much less comprehensible. Some people say these films are the exact same thing and I have to strongly disagree. In the first film you could find the characters enjoyable and sometimes even whimsical. This one everyone is a cardboard cutout. First film the special effects were enough to dazzle you. This one they are so elaborate and over developed that you often had trouble understanding what was going on! This movie is an attack on your senses, plain and simple, though it's bound to make plenty of money and a third film will undoubtedly be spawned I can only say that no one will be talking about this series five years from now. It is just a passing fancy, something pretty to look at, like the cars showcased in this movie.  Whoever kept Michael Bay in-check for the first film needs to come back.<br /><br />Only good part of the film is seeing the new Corvette Stingray. Now that's a nice car, but not something [...] Luckily I snuck into this mess and paid nothing (and even then I want a refund).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Boy Meets a Girl and She Is a Vampire: Dark Fantasy / Horror with a Diffrence"></head><body><p>The tagline of the chilling Swedish thriller "L?t den r&auml;tte komma in" ("Let the Right One in") goes like this: "Eli is 12 years old. She's been 12 for over 200 years and, she just moved in next door." And Eli has a secret to hide, a big, dark secret that a 12-year-old boy Oskar, who befriends Eli, is to know very soon<br /><br />Perhaps you already know the secret of Eli, an enigmatic girl with a pale face. Yes, she is a vampire. Not much is known about her past. Set in the early 80s, the film follows the story of a bullied boy Oskar and Eli, a girl who lives with a tired, middle-aged man H?kan. His past is shrouded in nearly as much mystery as Eli herself. All we know is H?kan, always faithful to Eli, is ready to do anything for her - even if it may violate laws.<br /><br />"Let the Right One in," based on the book by John Ajvide Lindqvist (which I haven't read), is not just a vampire horror. It works as a horror, and it scares us in a most unexpected way (like a stylish swimming pool sequence which is unforgettable), but the film is also a very dark version of a "boy-meets-girl" story. The difference is, their romance is not always sweet, and the couple's "happiness" does not necessarily mean that of the others around them.<br /><br />Director Tomas Alfredson gives a unique twist to the now familiar conventions of vampire tales: gender-reversed roles of main characters, for instance (compare this one with the "Twilight" saga). To some viewers the most intriguing part of the film would be the untold story of Eli the vampire. Where did she come? Is she alone? The film is set in the 1980s - but why is that? Possibilities are suggested and they are open to our imagination. And what makes the film special is the cold atmosphere and the chemistry between the leads.<br /><br />"Let the Right One in" is a smart vampire movie with a few things to add to the genre.</p></body></html>

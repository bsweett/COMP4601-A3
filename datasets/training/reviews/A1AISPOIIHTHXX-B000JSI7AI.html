<meta name="summary" content="A great love story or overhyped liberalism?"></head><body><p>This movie got a large amount of controversy, all of it going to its theme: homosexuality. While it certainly feels like a breakthrough film, there have been films with the very same theme before. Most of them, however, are barely seen as they're usually arty independent movies or foreign ones. Brokeback in many ways shows that it's still a problem with people and while it may have some storytelling issues I have a problem with, it's still a solid story, it's only missing something that makes it an absolute masterpiece.<br /><br />In probably one of the most slowest opening 40 minutes I've ever seen, we follow Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar as they become sheep herders. Alone for a long time, the 2 act on feelings that they might love each other. Of course the problem is they're both men which is very frowned upon at the time. The 2 go home and end up leading separate lives but are very much wondering about the love that could've lasted.<br /><br />Flash forward 4 years and Ennis marries Alma who gave birth to 2 daughters while Jack meets Lureen and they have a son. A meeting between the 2 men rekindles their relationship and now have a decision to make: to continue in short and increasing gaps of time or call it off forever, not experiencing each other's love anymore. This of course doesn't sit well with either of them, or their wives.<br /><br />There will be people who probably won't like this review(or any other like it) where I don't outright praise the film for the masterpiece that it is and that I either don't "get it" or I'm a homophobe. I'm not gay but I don't go after them either, it's love period regardless of who's in it(although I do have problems with animal lovers and pedophiles). The film has been called groundbreaking but really it's just a love story, only with 2 men. What about movies where the underdog team actually lost instead of triumphing in a big finish? Or a crime story that has the killer actually win? Storytelling wise these could be called groundbreakers too and they've been done before as well.<br /><br />Acting-wise it's straight across the board with Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway proving that they can be actresses(the latter's turn in Havoc was just wasted). Jake Gyllenhaal is good as well but the biggest attention went to Heath Ledger. Granted it's a very good performance full of nuance but at the same time, he almost mumbles through the entire thing. I'm glad I put subtitles on sometimes, otherwise I wouldn't know what he was saying half the time.<br /><br />It's odd how the filmmakers want us to root for the love of 2 gay men despite the fact both are committing adultery, one of which is actually with 2 others, including his wife. The other actually ends up getting divorced because of it and to see the 2 men get together only to hide away their feelings and be quiet about it you kind of wonder, "they seem happier with their women don't they?" It's slightly manipulative as well since the cinematography during their passionate love trips are beautifully shot with mountain ranges while their normal homes have drabby looking houses, crying kids and depressed looking wives. It's no wonder we want to root for the men don't we?<br /><br />I will give the film props though: it is a love story and it's handled nicely if one sided and the actors are more than willing to show it. It might seem like I'm using more from the con list but it does have great cinematography, a relaxing(if extremely repetitive) score which I have no idea why it won the Oscar. The story between the women could've been handled better though. Michelle Williams literally drops out at one point in the story and the direction on Anne Hathaway during her last scene makes the ambigious ending even moreso.<br /><br />Expect a double dip, this one is guaranteed. Obviously wanting to capitalize on the Oscar attention, the film comes with a very barebones disc, coming up with no more than 4 featurettes. No commentary? Deleted scenes? Coincidentally, Crash which got the upset Best Picture win over this film is released on the same day with a bigger release. Trying to steal thunder, methinks? It's a solid story and while it is a good film, I can see why it lost, although personally, Crash is no better.</p></body></html>

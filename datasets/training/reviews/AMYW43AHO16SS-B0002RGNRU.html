<meta name="summary" content="An incredible ride I've never experienced in a movie before!"></head><body><p>We really don't see what goes on in a person's mind.  This is the closest we get to what a person is thinking.  Charlie Kaufman's screenplay is bold and innovative.  It may leave many people confused and bewildered. But it makes sense for everything that happens when you want to get rid of someone's memories.<br /><br />Jim Carrey has proven he's not just a funny man.  He can be a serious actor worthy of Oscar consideration.  Kate Winslet is marvelous as Clementine, the girl who undergoes the procedure to erase memories of Joel.  This movie is happy, charming and unforgetable.</p></body></html>

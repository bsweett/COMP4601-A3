<meta name="summary" content="This is how movies is suppose to be"></head><body><p>This movie got straight to the action before any plot even started which made the movie even better.Most people judge this movie by saying it's stupid and not having any point,but people who love to have fun with action films,this is for you.It's fun,<br /><br />scary,and gets you going,and it doesn't have stupid love stories in it.</p></body></html>

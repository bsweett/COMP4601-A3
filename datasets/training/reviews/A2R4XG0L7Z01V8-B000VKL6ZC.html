<meta name="summary" content="I have to admit, I wasn't a fan of the original Halloween"></head><body><p>In fact, I was actually bored throughout the first Halloween, and never bothered to watch any of the MANY sequels. My mum loves the original movies for some reason, but I just never saw the appeal.<br /><br />When I was asked to go and see the Rob Zombie 'remake', I was sceptical to say the least. I didn't remember too much of the original, the occasional scene here and there. But I do like Rob Zombie movies, and own House of 1000 Corpses and Devil's Rejects. He at least seemed like a good choice to do a remake, even if it was unnecessary.<br /><br />The movie starts with a young Michael Myers at home with his mum (Sheri Moon Zombie), his older sister, his baby sister, and his deadbeat stepfather. His stepfather and mother have many screaming matches during the opening scenes, and Michael seems to be caught up in all this. His older sister doesn't seem to care about him, his younger sister doesn't have a clue what's going on, and his mother would care about him if she wasn't constantly trying to clear up after his stepfather and doing her poledancing job. The sister's promiscuous, and looks to follow in the footsteps of her mother with a deadbeat boyfriend.<br /><br />I won't reveal anything more about the movie, for those who haven't seen it (but you need to go and see it). Sheri Moon's role is unfortunately, not as long as her previous movies, but she's still terrific, if getting a tad skinny.<br /><br />What shocked me about this version of Halloween, is that I actually found myself sympathising with Michael's character. With the whole build up as to what started him off killing (what do you expect with that family?), Rob Zombie does give the impression that he's trying to give Michael a heart, a conscience. The other strange thing is that after the age of 10, you never see Michael's face. He's hiding his face behind his hair, and eventually, the infamous mask, and you desperately try to picture a grown up Michael, but it didn't work for me, I always ended up picturing a 10-year-old's face behind the mask.<br /><br />The film does start to stutter when it skips to the present day, which I think was supposed to be set in the mid nineties, and it did start to go on a go slow for me.<br /><br />Halloween I didn't think was scary, much the same as I thought about the original. But it's so, so, so gory, it's unbelievable. A teenage girl (the actress was in her late twenties) lying topless, stabbed numerous times, still alive. A man, with his throat slashed, still desperately trying to work out what has happened, as the blood bubbles down his front. Bleurgh.<br /><br />There's a great cast in this, of course including Sheri Moon Zombie, Brad Dourif (unrecognisable from his role as Billy in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest), Malcolm McDowell, and look out for Captain Spaulding too. Hehe.<br /><br />There is nudity in this - pretty, pert, perky teenage girls rolling around in bed with deadbeat men, and sending their men out for beer. Watch out for one funny bit, where the 'boyfriend' walks back in with the beer, and the girl doesn't even notice he's grown about a foot and a half in a few minutes. Hello, you'd think that would be obvious! Now get your chest off the screen and die already.<br /><br />Halloween 2007 is definitely superior to the 1978 version in my opinion. Many, many reviewers are going to heavily disagree with me on that point, and I've already seen my fair share of one star reviews. But it's not a bad movie. It's well worth seeing, and believe me, if you don't find it scary, you will be turning your face away from the screen when someone gets their throat cut.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Coen's near masterpiece"></head><body><p>Like their debut film, "Blood Simple", this dark film noir is set in Texas but unlike that film the ending leaves you perturbed. Perhaps what they're saying by the ending is that evil will always persist in this world no matter what ends you do to eliminate it. Again, it's definitely a matter of intepretation but I found this film deserving of the Best Picture of the year at the Oscars.  The great Spanish actor Javier Badem deserved to win for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of pure evil and Josh Brolin gave a career making performance as the pursued. Also the breathtaking cinematography of Roger Deakins deserves mention and I will definitely re-see this film on Blu-ray. I guess what prevents me from giving this fine film a full 5 stars is of course, the ending but don't let that prevent you from seeing this excellent film. Perhaps the Coen's best film to date since "Fargo".</p></body></html>

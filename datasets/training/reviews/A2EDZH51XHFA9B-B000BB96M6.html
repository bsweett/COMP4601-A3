They descend from a common ancestor, but have no more in common than you or I do with the Monkey Chain of Trust. (Well, not me. I'm not so sure about you sometimes.)<br /><br />In some ways, this version is closer to the source material than the older one-- for example, they have the right Oompa-Loompa songs this time (and thank Heaven for that). For about half the film, the kids seem truer to their book roots, as well, though things have been updated a bit (Mike Teevee, for example, is now a videogame devotee instead of a watcher of TV Westerns; either way, he gets his daily quantity of violence). Apart from that, though, this movie diverges as widely from the book as does the first one, but in decidedly odder ways. Not that this should be much of a surprise from Burton.<br /><br />The character of Willy Wonka, played here with far more an air of overt menace than Gene Wilder took in the original film, is the principal oddity. Wilder played things off as a nice fatherly sort of chap, which made it kind of hard to believe when he suddenly turned around and started raging. Depp's Wonka is thoroughly screwed up from the very start, and were I a ten-year-old about to accompany him into a factory, I'd have to check to make sure chocolate hadn't gotten into my britches on a regular basis. Whereas Wilder's Wonka was all about showing off the goodies, and taking as much delight in them as the kids did, Depp's version wanders through the landscape as if he has no idea what he's looking at. Positively creepy. (This makes the cutting of the original film's most infamous scene, the boat ride, all the more inexplicable.) One could make a pretty strong argument for Depp's character mirroring Willem Dafoe's brilliant performance as Count Orlok in Merhige's Shadow of the Vampire rather than anything that came out of the mind of either Dahl or Wilder.<br /><br />It's not a bad comparison, though one has to buy the idea that Depp himself actually took the path that Murnau (John Malkovich) provided as Orlok's cover story in Shadow. Depp looked into the motivations of his character, which are explored in depth here, and came up with a neurotic bag of bones who's so ill-socialized that, even when it comes to the moment he's been dreaming of these past few years, we still can't buy it. I'm relatively sure no one reading this review could possibly have gone their entire lives without seeing either the original film or this one, but I'll still not spoil the ending for you; let's just say that when it happens, it doesn't sit right.<br /><br />This is an immensely interesting film for all the wrong reasons. Johnny Depp's character is endlessly fascinating, but that's a whole different ball of wax than saying Willy Wonka, or the film that surrounds him, is immensely interesting. ** ?</p></body></html>

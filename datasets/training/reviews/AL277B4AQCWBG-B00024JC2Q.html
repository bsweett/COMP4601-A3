The plot's thin and the jokes are thinner.  Sure, there are some good moments - the quid-pro-quo interrogation of Will Ferrell, and an acrobatic knife-wielding Korean kid - but nothing is really laugh-out-loud funny.  With moments like the "dance off" echoing the "walk off" from "Zoolander", you get the feeling these guys are already repeating themselves.  Still, you just want to like them anyway.  Despite a bad script, the duo have enough onscreen presence to have you giggling: Stiller's frustrated-little-guy shtick gets another incarnation in Starsky, the by-the-book cop trying to live up to the reputation of his policewoman mother, and Wilson's laid back, laconic, almost Zen-like 'non-acting' continues to pay off for him.  They're almost enough to carry the film, but not quite.  Watching Stiller and Wilson is like watching your two kid brothers on screen: you want to like what they do, you want to see the best in it, but sometimes it just isn't there.  When it works for them, as it so often does - in marvellous movies like "The Royal Tenenbaums", "Zoolander" and "Meet the Parents" - the results are hilarious.  But when they fail, it breaks your heart.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What an unexpected surprise!"></head><body><p>This is the movie that put Josh Hartnett on the acting map for me. His earlier works have been easy enough to avoid and consider yourself lucky if you've been able to do so. I do hope this is a transition on his part into better roles; he was entertaining. His quick-witted quips keep you laughing and help you avoid the need to wonder what on earth is going on in the movie. They fill you in due time, even though I wouldn't be surprised if you figure out the ending before it unfolds; you wouldn't be the first.<br /><br />It seemed a little silly to have Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley in roles such as these since they were relatively small roles. But they definitely added big names to draw attention to a movie more people should see.<br /><br />I feel like I should have more to say about this movie, but I can really sum it up by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed Lucky # Slevin.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A movie worth watching!"></head><body><p>The Forgotten brings to the screen the story of a mother who refuses to accept what everyone (including her own husband) seems to be telling her about her son never having existed and having been part of her imagination all along.  Things get more complicated when she begins sensing not only that she did have a son, but that he is still alive, and that there are others who are also having similar feelings...<br /><br />It is a movie about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, inner strength, courage, sacrifice, and how love-motherly love, can overcome and prevail even in the most difficult of situations.<br /><br />There are slight hints of Arrival, and strong/obvious elements of the X-Files.<br /><br />Julianne Moore, Dominic West, Gary Sinise, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!<br /><br />The only setback is in relation to these characters not having, not having parents-grandparents, brothers-sisters, best friends-distant friends, or is everyone under the effect?  If so, the main characters should be at least seen trying to get a hold of EVERYONE they know, not just the neighbor, for verification.<br /><br />The plot, the setting, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music are all EXCELLENT!<br /><br />In conclusion, The Forgotten is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment; it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.</p></body></html>

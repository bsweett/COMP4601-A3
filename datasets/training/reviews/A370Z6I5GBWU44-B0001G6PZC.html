<meta name="summary" content="Good movie"></head><body><p>This is a pretty enjoyable movie with a good amount of Japanese history in it. It's not entirely accurate, but it is still a good film nonetheless, and Tom Cruise does a good job in his role. The setting of Japan is also done well as well as its Westernization as Japanese citizens either embrace it or fight against it. Overall a good historical film.</p></body></html>

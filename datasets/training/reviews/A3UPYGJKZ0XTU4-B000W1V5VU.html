Dialogue and Plot Induce Hazy State."></head><body><p>"Ocean's Thirteen" is better than the abysmal "Ocean's Twelve", but this is another exercise in panache from Steven Soderbergh and all-star company with limited entertainment value. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his gang plot a revenge job this time. Mentor Ruben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould) has been swindled out of his share of a dream Las Vegas hotel by business partner Willie Bank (Al Pacino). The gang intends to compel Bank to restore Reuben's share by making the hotel's Grand Opening go very wrong. If they can cause the casino to lose money, Bank will default on his loans. And if they ensure the hotel won't receive a 5-star rating, Bank will be humiliated.<br /><br />To call this plot flimsy would be generous. "Ocean's Thirteen" is a series of disjointed conversations and glamorous sets. It jumps from one person or place to another with little reason. The point seems to be mediocre one-liners and a striking color palette. Soderbergh fills the screen with oranges and cerulean blue. Most scenes could have been left out. The crime itself is dull as dishwater, an unforgivable fault in a heist movie. But all the frenetic editing and meaningless scenes left me to ponder the fabulous colors. The production design and lighting earn all 3 stars. "Ocean's Thirteen" is a 2-hour fractured vignette of a fantasy Las Vegas. Cutting a half hour would have helped.<br /><br />The DVD (Warner Brothers 2007): Bonus features include some deleted scenes and 2 featurettes. "Vegas: An Opulent Illusion" (22 min) is an interesting documentary on the evolving culture, architecture, and economy of Las Vegas. It interviews an architect, casino host, owner, and others about the Strip's constant reinvention, the lure of casinos, the lifestyle of high rollers, and the current transition from mega resorts to design-oriented architecture. In "Jerry Weintraub: Walk and Talk" (2 1/2 min), the producer takes us on a tour of the casino sets. Subtitles are available for the film in English, English SDH, French, Spanish. Dubbing available in French and Spanish.</p></body></html>

Released in the 1980's it had a big fight with the MPAA to keep it R, not X!<br /><br /> Basicly, it's about this Cuban guy named Tony Montana who was a criminal in Cuba, after escaping a camp in Florida for Cuban criminal immagrants, joins the life of crime. And so begins the rise [and fall] of Tony!<br /><br /> If you liked GTA, you will like this! Lots of action, swearing, crime, you name it. It's a pretty long movie, so hold on! A mob masterpiece!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - The Movie"></head><body><p>Ok, so I'm probably going to be fairly unpopular with my assessment of this movie, but considering the 4th book is probably my favorite (equally tied with the 1st) I expected a lot from the movie, and it just didn't deliver for me.  On a different subject though, if you're reading this review and haven't seen any of the other movies or read the books yet, turn around, go start at the beginning.  You'll regret it if you don't because such a wonderful series as this has to start at the beginning.<br /><br />Harry Potter is in his fourth year at Hogwarts, like usual he has the summer to be with his aunt and uncle though (who are loathsome people).  But this summer is a little different, the Quidditch World Cup is going on and Harry attends with his friends and their family.  But something goes terribly awry at the tournament, and it sets the tone for the rest of the year.  Harry's nightmares too point to something terrible happening, something involving Voldemort.  But at school these fears are quickly put aside when it is announced that the Tri-Wizard tournament will be held at Hogwarts, and include two other schools.  The all boys school Durmstrang, and the all girls school Beauxbaton.  One champion will be picked from each school to compete in a series of challenges and ultimately be the winner of the Tri-Wizard Cup.  The only problem is, Harry somehow becomes a fourth contestant, and the games can be brutal.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Daniel Radcliffe: Harry Potter<br />Rupert Grint: Ron Weasley<br />Emma Watson: Hermione Granger<br />Robbie Coltrane: Rubeus Hagrid<br />Ralph Fiennes: Lord Voldemort<br />Michael Gambon: Albus Dumbledore<br />Brendan Gleeson: Alstor Moody<br />Gary Oldman: Sirius Black<br />Miranda Richardson: Rita Skeeter<br />Alan Rickman: Severus Snape<br /><br />What can I say about Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson that I haven't already?  They make a great team on the set and you can truly believe they are the best of friends.  I enjoy watching them in every single movie.  The same with Coltrane as Hagrid, you can't help but love him as he stumbles around on the screen.  Gambon as Dumbledore had a larger part this time, and while I appreciated that, I just didn't feel the warmth from him like there is in the book.  He just was written more approachable than the role is actually played so that is a bit disappointing.  The new characters in this movie were cast ok, but none of them have the charm that the original cast members do.<br /><br />The plot did not really follow the book that well.  Sure there are plenty of moments that are the same, but for a lot of the important things it was vastly changed.  And I did not like that at all.  Especially the last challenge of the Tri-Wizard tournament.  It didn't even remotely resemble what was in the book and it was a very small part in the overall scheme of the movie.  It was disappointing.  The same with a lot of the interaction of the three schools.  So much was missed and I think it really detracted from the magic of the movie.  Actually, despite the movie being so long, it just felt rushed, like they didn't care about the details in this one.<br /><br />Luckily the cinematography was mostly back up to par in this movie.  Everything seemed more authentic, but as said before, lacking in detail.  There were so many things they could have included from the books to make it spectacular (sphinx anyone?) and they just didn't for whatever reason.  The music was still good, and I still get that shiver down my spine when I hear the opening music, so I'm glad that there is something I can rely on.  Although the music/choreography for the introduction of Beauxbaton was just plain weird to me (watch and see if you agree!).  By contrast, Durmstrang's entrance was much better.<br /><br />I'll always watch all of the movies and enjoy them, but I do admit I cringe a little bit when I get to this one.  If I hadn't have read the books I probably would have enjoyed it more, but it still would have felt rushed.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012</p></body></html>

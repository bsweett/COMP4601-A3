From beginning till end, I found my attention transfixed on the screen, the story is that compelling.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood plays an aging Korean War vet, Walt Kowalski who has recently been widowed. He seems irascible, perpetually squinting in disapproval, basically a curmudgeon. He does not seem to have a loving relationship with his two grown sons who are both married with families of their own. Walt is also something of a racist, spewing some racial slurs at the Hmong family that has moved next door.<br /><br />Within this setting, Walt's path crosses that of the Hmong family next door with some surprising results - the young Hmong teenager, a boy named Thao [Bee Vang] is an alienated teen who is being pressured by a group of Hmong gang members to join them. Although Thao is disinterested, he is forced by the gang to steal a prized 72' Gran Torino from Kowalski's garage. The attempt fails when Thao is interrupted by Kowalski, and this acts as a catalyst for all the events that follow.<br /><br />The gang members, infuriated by Thao's failure, return to bash him up, but are faced with Kowalski's wrath instead [he just wanted them off his lawn]. Later, Kowalski rescues Thao's sister, Sue [Ahney Her] from being harassed by a group of black guys and she worms her way into Kowalski's good graces, taking all the slurs in her stride and eventually gaining Kowalski's genuine affection. Gradually the Hmongs next door cease to become just another group of "gooks" but like a real family to Kowalski, something he has never really had, except with his beloved late wife. But, the Hmong gang refuses to let Thao alone and this sets off a chain of events that truly reveal the depth of Kowalski's bond to the family.<br /><br />There are so many complex themes explored in this movie - aging, loneliness, racism, peer pressure, evil , faith, courage, alienation, and many more. Yet, in Mr Eastwood's capable hands, these myriad themes are all linked together in a seamless fashion, giving viewers a movie with real soul - insightful and deep, and thought-provoking. The climax when it comes, is simply mind-blowing and so very beautifully executed, delivering a powerful message.<br /><br />The movie is definitely carried by Eastwood's portrayal of Kowalski as the old racist war vet who in fact embodies real courage, steely determination and plenty of heart. The actors portraying the Hmong seemed rather stilted in their performances, especially Bee Vang's Thao, though I liked Ahney Her's portrayal of the acerbic and candid Sue. There was also another highlight performance, that of the Catholic priest, Father Janovich [Christopher Carley] who seems initially way out of his depth in trying to get Walt to confession [as per Walt's late wife's wishes], and whose baby-face actually belies a strong character, determined to do the right thing.<br /><br />"Gran Torino" is a gem of a movie, and is one of those rare dramas of substance that had me pondering about issues long after the credits rolled.</p></body></html>

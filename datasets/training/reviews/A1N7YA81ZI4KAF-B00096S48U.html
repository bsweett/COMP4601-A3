<meta name="summary" content="Nicely Done Remake of a Horror Classic Still Manages to Induce Fear But the Original Remains Superior"></head><body><p>An American Diplomat living in the UK, Robert Thorn (Liev Schreiber) and his wife Katherine, (Julia Stiles) have their lives turned upside down when strange occurrences begin to plague their lives and all seem to be connected to their son, Damien Thorn, who may be the antichrist as foretold in the book of Revelations. The evil forces that are protecting this spawn of Lucifer will do anything to protect his identity and death befalls anyone who dares to investigate this secret.<br /><br />This better than expected remake of the 1976 horror film is technically well done with good performances from the ensemble cast and offers some unnerving imagery and tone. Since this is almost a by the numbers remake of the original, there is very little suspense. Those who have seen the original already know what is going to happen to these characters and to keep them interested, they updated the material (linking the return of the antichrist to today's current events) and inserted a couple of nifty dream sequences which are brief but effective and in one instance, incredibly hair-raising (Robert Thorn's brief dream in Italy- Gotta Love that smiling Priest). I also noticed there is an emphasis on the color red throughout- red flowers, red fruits, characters draped in red cloaks, red night gowns and in one genuinely scary scene, a person draped in red, runs across the screen in the distance just as one of the characters is about to meet their end. Some may find this in your face symbolism a bit too heavy handed but I found it effective.<br /><br />Although the performances were good, I did find the cast a little too young to be truly believable in their roles. There was a maturity and a certain air of sophistication the 2 original leads conveyed that is missing here. However both lead actors still managed to turn in solid performances. I especially liked Julia Stiles. Her take on Kate Thorn differs from Lee Remick's. Stiles gives us a more distant Katherine. One who comes under suspicion of her offspring quite early on and never manages to let go. She seems extremely annoyed by him and once convinced of his malice, she is consumed by fear and paranoia. Despite of what some detractors say, I found her performance the most believable of the bunch and her character, although a lot more rougher around the edges than Lee Remick's portrayal, managed to induce real sympathy. She is after all a victim. Another stand out was Mia Farrow who plays Mrs. Baylock minus the accent. Billie Whitelaw who played the original was sinister enough and resembled a brutally demented Mary Poppins. Farrow's take on this character is still charming but her wickedness is less obvious. Although I do love her sinister smile as she feeds Damien his strawberries just before the vicious little demon gets on his scooter of doom and rides it towards his unsuspecting mother.<br /><br />My only disappointment in the casting was with the choice of Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick as Damien. Admittedly, he is a creepy kid but he fails to convey that innocence that Harvey Stephens, the original Damien had. What I loved about the original, was that Damien, at times, looked angelic and seemed unaware of the chaos that was taking place around him. It was as if he wasn't fully conscious of who he was yet the creepy characters around him made it clear to us that he was the devils offspring. Evil is at its most scary when it comes wrapped in childish innocence. Davey-Fitzpatrick is creepy from the get-go. Another major disappointment was with Marco Beltrami's score. It is good enough but when you are competing with Jerry Goldsmith's original, you better out-do yourself and in this case, the score fails to deliver the chilling magic of the original. The death sequences are pretty standard. They are carbon copies of the original (with the exception of Kate's grisly demise and the photographers decapitation is executed differently) so not much to report here.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is good but when compared to Donner's original, it is inferior. You can say the same about the cast. They do their best but comparing them to Gregory Peck and Lee Remick is not exactly fair (although I did like Stiles) and despite some new elements added- the dream sequences, the hooded demon dog cameos etc and higher, glossier production values, "The Omen" (2006) will forever remain inferior, at least in my eyes, to the greater original visualization of hell on earth.</p></body></html>

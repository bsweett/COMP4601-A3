<meta name="summary" content="Bruce Willis is a superhero"></head><body><p>In "Unbreakable" Bruce plays an everyday man David Dunn who has extraordinary powers. After escaping a tragedy unharmed he starts to think that there is something wrong with him because he's never been hurt in his life. David comes to meet another gentleman on the other side of the pendulum, Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) who has gone out of his way to follow David's miraculous powers. The more the plot unfolds the more we learn that David is such a heroic and humbled man who just wants to find out why he is like this. Bruce Willis was especially believable during the scene with the gun. There was so much passion in his voice. But it's not until David starts to embrace his special powers that he was born with does he really start to see what is going on around with him. It's like he is able to step outside of the box and look at the entire picture and that picture isn't very pretty and it's not very nice to look at. And that's why this role was so perfect for Bruce because he was able to channel his natural abilities of drama and even action to give such power and credence to an everyday man who happens to be everyone's hero. There is a plot twist that will really catch you for a loop, I can't imagine anyone would expect it. This is a wonderful movie because it's both uplifting and empowering and shows that heroes or angels or whatever you want to call them walk among us. "Unbreakable" is also an affective movie for displaying evil and virtu in the most semblance and basic ways. Robin Wright was also excellent playing Bruce's wife because there was an almost severe and magnanimous quality about her character that came shining through. If you enjoy Bruce Willis (and who doesn't?), dramas with a twist ending or just excellent movies that you can be proud to share with your entire family than this movie is for you.</p></body></html>

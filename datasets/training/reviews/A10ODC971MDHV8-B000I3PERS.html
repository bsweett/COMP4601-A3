<meta name="summary" content="Braveheart"></head><body><p>Epic, grand-scale moviemaking at its best, Gibson's Oscar-winning tale of heroism and courage in 1300s Scotland marked a sensational triumph in the director's chair for the durable star. Ruggedly charismatic, Gibson plays a peaceful man reluctantly drawn into the violent drift of history, after which he becomes a ferocious leader and combatant. Sophie Marceau is alluring as Isabelle, a stunning English princess who draws Wallace's eye and heart, but the film really blazes thanks to Gibson's savage, jaw-dropping battle sequences. Even at three hours, "Braveheart" never loses its interest or intensity.</p></body></html>

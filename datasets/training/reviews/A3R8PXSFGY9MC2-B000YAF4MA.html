<meta name="summary" content="The Bucket List"></head><body><p>'The Bucket List' is a film showing two masters of their art in fine form. Both Nicholson and Freeman manage to pull off the perfect mix of comedy and poignancy in this film without becoming too cheesy or schmaltzy. The premise is actually very simply (2 terminally ill patients working their way through their own Bucket list) but manages to capture their relationships, fears about dying, philosophy about life and more besides in it's short but very sweet 90 minutes. I was kept thoroughly engaged the whole time and enjoyed every minute as they worked their way through a variety of experiences, from sky diving, getting a tattoo, to kissing the most beautiful girl in the world and a whole host of other things. This made for a fun film, with the right elements of humour and sadness and made a serious point about relishing your life without hammering the point home. It left me wondering about what experiences I've yet to try and with an all round good feeling. You can't ask much more from a film really. Great story, great acting and well worth a try.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

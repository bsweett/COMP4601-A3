<meta name="summary" content="Interesting, but less than great"></head><body><p>Interesting premise that never quite achieves its potential narratively or cinematically.  And the special illusions that Norton's character performs onstage aren't really that interesting anyway.<br /><br />This film, like "The Prestige", never quite fires on all cylinders.<br /><br />Rufus Sewell is quite good in this, though.  His character is far more interesting than those of the movie's two leads.</p></body></html>

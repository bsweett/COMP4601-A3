<meta name="summary" content="Man on Fire is a Great Revenge Movie"></head><body><p>Very few actors possess the talent to make a successful revenge movie. This is pure escapism.  Only a great one can pull it off.  Man on Fire definitely does not have a complicated plot.  There are few surprises and one can easily predict what will happen in the next scene.  This film includes the expected sweet little girl, Pita (Dakota Fanning), who is guaranteed to pull at your heart strings.  She is adorable, innocent, and all that other mushy stuff.  Denzel Washington (John Creasey) portrays the conventional former American secret agent who one upon a time ruthlessly dealt with our country's enemies.  Reading the Bible helps to unburden Creasey's guilty soul, but alcohol helps him get through the day. He is traveling through Mexico when a buddy from the old days, Rayburn (Christopher Walken), persuades him to earn some money as the body guard of Pita.  Abductions are an everyday event in this one step above a third world country.  Corrupt police are a ho-hum reality.  The well-to-do are constantly targeted, and Pita's family will be no exception.  Criminals grab her, something goes wrong during the exchange of money for the child, and you should be able to figure out the rest for yourself.<br /><br />Now comes what you really desire to see in this movie: John Creasey exacting revenge on the bad guys.  The dude punishes the evil doers in some unpleasant ways.  It's gory, brutal---and very satisfying.  Gratuitous violence can sometimes be rewarding.  Hey, we all can't be another Mahatma Ghandi! Denzel Washington should be considered for an Academy Award for his performance, but this type of a artistry rarely garners such respect and adulation from the Hollywood community.</p></body></html>

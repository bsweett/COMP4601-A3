<meta name="summary" content="A Cinematic and Artistic Look at what we call Life"></head><body><p>This movie is visually stunning but it is not intended for those who need constant action.  After a confusing start this movie bloomed into something incredible.  Really hard to describe in words it had such strong spiritual overtones than anyone who has faith will feel more enlightened.<br /><br />This journey begins in 1500 A.D. as the main character is a Spaniard in Ancient Mexico in search of Eternal Life.  It is said a tree possesses this power.  Although you are not really given that information at first it becomes evident how beautiful the cinematography is.<br /><br />The Fountain focuses around 2000 A.D. and the story of a doctor who is fighting to keep his beautiful wife alive.  It is not necessarily her physical beauty but that of her spiritual presence that makes her an amazing character.  Full of energy and life despite being stricken with cancer.  Her husband cannot accept this journey she is on.  Instead he continues to focus on some way to keep her alive.<br /><br />I watched the Blu-ray edition.  This movie is chock full of special features making much more of an experience for those who want to watch.  The picture is not superb as compared to other Blu-rays I have seen.  The audio for the most part is also average.  I believe all versions include the same special features.  I would say if the DVD version is much cheaper to get that one and watch it on an upscaled DVD player.<br /><br />The movies visual appeal also makes it confusing at times as The Fountain continually switches from past, present, and future.  The stories begin to meld make it more understandable.  What is left is an understanding over what life is really about.  This movie is not intending for everyone.  Those who may enjoy are probably spiritual and open minded enough to accept different theories of life.  It may be a tough movie emotionally for those who lost someone close in their life.  I loved the movie and somehow feel more enlightened after going on this wonderful voyage.</p></body></html>

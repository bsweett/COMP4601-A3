When she starts having visions, in particular that of a young dead woman, she becomes increasingly more agitated by the idea that a ghost needs to communicate some horrendous truth to her.<br /><br />It's kind of like `Gothika', just not as bad.<br /><br />It's a very good thing that Michelle Pfeiffer chews this film up.  She just attacks this performance with so much dedication and fearlessness that you almost forgive her for giving way to this choppy (and at times rather silly) script.  She's actually very close to fabulous here.  Shockingly, the acting all the way around is pretty great.  Even Harrison Ford, an actor who is very hit or miss (more often miss) for me.  He carries the eerie sense of destructive charm that suits his character flawlessly.  I also thought that Diana Scarwid was rather great here as well, serving up your typical token `best friend' role with a twist.<br /><br />I only wish that this film didn't wear its influences on its sleeves.  The film borrows so heavily from other, more successful films of this nature, and it's blatantly obvious.  When you look at a film like `The Sixth Sense' (one of many that this film borrows from), you can see how they used originality to their advantage to create something that will break boundaries.<br /><br />This film doesn't do that.<br /><br />The film kind of escalates to a rather chaotic and unsuccessful ending, but there are moments throughout that balance things off, helping `What Lies Beneath' become recommended viewing.  This is far from the best in the genre, but it's also far from the worst (I give it a C+. verging on a B-).  It's fun and spooky, and even when it reaches levels of ridiculous camp (such as that laughable possession scene), the film is redeemed by committed acting that never fails to sell the unsellable.</p></body></html>

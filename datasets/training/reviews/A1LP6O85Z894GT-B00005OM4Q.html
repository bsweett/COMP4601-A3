<meta name="summary" content="One of the best films of 2000"></head><body><p>Cameron Crowe, former teenaged rock critic matured into essayist, screenwriter and film director,  created my favorite film of 2000 (tied with "O Brother Where Art Thou") by bottling a precious ingredient found in few movies- real magic. <p>Drawing from his own rich autobiography, Crowe vividly relates the journey of a teenage Odysseus (played here with wide eyed purity by Patrick Fugit) who embarks on a journey of discovery, pain, love, maturation, loss and spiritual awakening. <p>The magic of Almost Famous lies in its characters' abilities to reach that most heroic of human experience: transformation into a better self.<br /><br />Fugit plays William Miller, a fifteen year old genius based upon Crowe himself, who is given the impossible task of writing a "think piece" in Rolling Stone magazine about a fictitious rock and roll band called Stillwater. Forced to travel the road with the band and their entourage of "professional girl friends/fans/groupies"- called band-aides here, Miller finds himself caught between staying true to his calling- writing honestly- and betraying new found friends. <p>Crowe's genius, as previously expressed in his earlier films Say Anything, Jerry Maguire and Singles lies in his ability to craft through careful collaboration with his always superb casts, real people who despite great character flaws and warts, have the spark of goodness inside them. In a Cameron Crowe film, everyone has the chance to be saved- and in their own way- everyone does end up forgiven and transformed.<p>Unlike many of his cold-hearted, mean spirited and cynical film making peers who actively seek out the sordid, the ugly and the destructive in society, Crowe possesses a sincere love not only for his characters and the world they inhabit but for the audience as well. That love radiates throughout every frame of every film he makes (this does not speak to his misstep "Vanilla Sky")<p>Crowe also possesses an uncanny instinct to marry music with the film. The sequence fusing Elton John's "Tiny Dancer" to a Stillwater's collective forgiveness of Russell Hammond is pure bliss. Of course Crowe creates many other similar sequences with music and image.<br /><br />This is not to suggest Almost Famous sugarcoats the harsh realities of an early 1970's rock and roll experience. Crowe is too honest a storyteller to allow that.  Free sex, drugs and the related decadence are ever present as are the consequences for such behavior. There is a real general callous soulessness that lurks on the tip of each scene threatening to consume the frail humanity of this Odyssey. But that evil is held at bay and ultimately destroyed by the great good that certainly dwells in every character's heart.<p>As consistent with all previous Crowe films, the acting ensemble is perfect. She has so many scenes that literally broke my heart while making me smile. Billy Crudup as self obsessed guitarist Russell Hammond, although far too good looking for any real rock star, swings gloriously unpredictable between sullen silence, affable congeniality and rage. He is a star in the making. Jason Lee, as lead singer Jeff Bebe, possesses just the right amount of shallow intellectual posings, narcissistic self promotion and paranoid uncertainty that prevails so many in his vocation. Frances McDormand is absolutely perfect as Miller's hyper-protective Mother. <p>The director's cut DVD is a God Send. The commentary by Crowe and his mother is priceless as is the fleshed out sequences which manage to humanize and elevate the characters even more. Being able to read the complete script is fascinating also as a reference point. It proves the old addage that all good films must begin with a great script.<br /><br />Almost Famous is Absolute Magic. Don't miss this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="PUNCH-DRUNK ON STYLISTIC SCATTERSHOTS"></head><body><p>It's a thin blurry line that separates a classy production of "The Insider" cadre from the indulgent eye-numbing pablum showcased in movies like these, which are fun for 10 minutes but then begin to grate with pointless shots and flashbacks.<br /><br />The story of our Man on Fire is not too bad, it takes its own sweet time to come about, but holds your attention if only for the jarring curiosity to figure out what's going to happen and to whom.<br /><br />The little girl even offers some very compelling moments in the earlier bits of the film. Smart, cute kid.<br /><br />Until it all comes loose with genre devices -- hardened professional killer softened by his friendship with a cuddly child, or a startlingly imaginative rampage of revenge.<br /><br />Cliches as old as the trees abound, "Revenge is a dish best served cold", which forms a feeble precursor to the full justification of our urban cowboy's unbridled violence -- "...because he can deliver more justice in a weekend than the highest authorities working in tandem with the media could deliver in 10 years".<br /><br />Denzel is reliable in inducing his usual doses of intensity but I couldn't help dismissing his character as a caricature when he began chasing goons all round town with gaping bullet wounds in his chest. If the director was going for a humorous touch, it surely sneaked in.<br /><br />Don't miss the intriguing epilogue assuring viewers that Mexico City, seen as little more than a smouldering cauldron of murder and corruption for the previous 140 minutes, is actually "a very special place".<br /><br />More than one can say for the movie, but just about as credible.</p></body></html>

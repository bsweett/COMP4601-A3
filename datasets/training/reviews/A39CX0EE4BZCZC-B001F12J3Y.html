<meta name="summary" content="One Of The Best Animated Films Ever"></head><body><p>I found myself saying "wow" over and over as I watched this movie on DVD went it came out just before Thanksgiving of 2005. Since then, I've seen it a half-dozen times and it continually amazes  Each time I think I'm watching the most beautiful or amazing artwork I've ever seen drawn for a movie. The visuals are just stunning, scene after scene.<br /><br />The sound ain't bad, either! Those not playing this on a surround system are missing an integral part of this movie and a lot of fun. The roar of train as it comes and goes, for one example, is awesome.<br /><br />It isn't just the great visuals and audio; the story is extremely entertaining all the way with some very adventurous scenes. There are a couple of roller coaster-type scenes which were especially fun, and actually thrilling.<br /><br /> Normally, 100 minutes is a bit long for me to sit through an animated film but this was filled with so many amazing sights and fun action scenes that time was no problem. Along the way are some touching messages about sharing life with other humans, and about giving.</p></body></html>

As is the case with many sci fi movies, the weaker acting is a bit of a distraction but the solid story and exceptional special effects easily carry the viewer through to the end.  I was tempted to upgrade to Blu-Ray but the widescreen DVD is exceptionally sharp, rivaling SuperBit and THX transfers on the high def screen.  The additional footage of the director's cut definitely adds significance to the story.  If you keep a Sci Fi movie library, The Chronicles of Riddick is a must have.</p></body></html>

Do I call out the haters and point out that the bulk of their complaints were based on the movie not being what they thought it'd be? What about the epic 7.1 soundtrack and score? The ferocious Noomi Rapace? The synthetic David? The fact that the Prometheus ship looks like a Firefly on steroids? There are a few hundred reviews that wrongly wax on plot elements and acting. Here's the film AND the BD review:<br /><br />This IS an ALIEN movie. We are watching the start of it all. While the film takes place in the same meta-plot, it is easy to see the creatures presented being some how related to xenomorphs... maybe with a dose or two of Cthulhu mentality - tentacles a plenty.  The BD release has some great features by way of deleted scenes (some that might have done better to have been kept in the film), commentary tracks (Ridley Scott pretty much narrates the film, but it's not as bad as it sounds; he gets really excited about this film), and a background featurette that focuses on Wayland. The visuals are amazing on an up-to-date BD player, and as I said, we get the treat of 7.1 (which shook my apartment, literally, at normal volumes; so be mindful of the volume unless you want your photos and whatnots to get shaken off the walls at what you might consider a 'normal' volume). It's overpowering at points, but it sounds great despite the heft of it.<br /><br />Enjoy this for what it is - a long awaited reunion to the Alien epic universe. We're just going to be experiencing some elements that were never covered in the Alien franchise. Where does that leave us?<br /><br />Where else, but in the trusted hands of Mr. Ridley Scott. It seems this new trilogy is going to answer more than the questions left open by the film Prometheus. We're getting to see some answers that have gone unanswered for over 30 years. Key word there - some.<br /><br />I've waited this long; the promise of two more films in this series have me waiting, hopeful, that Mr. Scott can deliver the next movies on the same level that is Prometheus. Beautiful. Epic. Eerie. And more than a little... alien.</p></body></html>

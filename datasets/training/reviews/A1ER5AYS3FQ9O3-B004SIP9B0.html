<meta name="summary" content="Mirren's performance is stunning as is the script"></head><body><p>Picking Helen Mirren to play the queen was an act of genius but even her spectacular performance could not have saved a lackluster script. I find it quite an achievement that this movie was able to create a (sometimes) sympathetic portrait of a woman who fell out of public favor in many circles after Princess Diana's death.<br /><br />  All the politics of the situation are played out in detail, giving a look at how the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and Mirren did a certain amount of dancing around the situation and the tensions there. The Queen was criticized for her stiffness and lack of emotion, but somehow this film manages to show the cracks in that rigid facade, doing so with a certain modicum of wit and grace. Also, I found myself surprised that the film actually made me think about the possible  benefits of a certain amount of reserve and decorum, commonly known as the "stiff upper lip", although I still feel there was far too much coldness on the Queen's part after the Princess died. It is a small miracle that the film manages to make her the slightest bit sympathetic, especially considering the bias many may feel against her because of her actions after Diana's death.<br /><br />  However you feel about the terrible events of Princess Diana's tragic accident and the events that followed, this movie is a superb portrayal of a woman who may be far more complex than believed. Watch it the first chance you get!</p></body></html>

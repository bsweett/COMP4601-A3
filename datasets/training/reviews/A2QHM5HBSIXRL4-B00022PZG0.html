<meta name="summary" content="Mike White's perfect Jack Black Script"></head><body><p>&quot;School of Rock&quot; was written by the increasingly prolific screenwriter and actor Mike White.  Here, White shows that such eye-openingly good works like &quot;The Good Girl&quot; (with Jennifer Aniston) and the critically acclaimed &quot;Chuck and Buck&quot; were no flukes.  For the first time since &quot;High Fidelity,&quot; Black is given material that suits him.  Credit White for writing and building a movie around Black's talents.  And if you think that sounds easy, go talk to makers of &quot;Shallow Hal&quot; and other Black miscastings.<p>From an acting perspective, there's Black above all others.  White modestly stays in the background.  His girlfriend Patty (Sarah Silverman) is pretty much a one-note shrew (that's the role written for her).  Joan Cusack is great when she appears - her little moment gathering herself alone in a hallway in face of an onslaught of parents is the movie's one bit of dramatic acting.  The kids are really superb.  I assume that's really them playing those instruments.  There's none of the tricky camera work when musical fakery is involved (shots of the head, shots of the hand).  You get full body shots - guitarist Zach (Joey Gaydos Jr.) expertly working the chords, keyboardist Lawrence (Robert Tsai) dexterously working up and down the scales.<p>As far as Black is concerned, I don't think this is acting at all.  This role appears to be him to a 'T'.  Credit Mike White for envisioning a really cute, smart movie around that thought.</p></body></html>

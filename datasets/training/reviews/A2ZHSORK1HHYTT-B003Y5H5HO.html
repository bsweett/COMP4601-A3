<meta name="summary" content="In Search Of Lisbeth Salander? -- Not In The American Version"></head><body><p>The major difference between the Swedish version and the American version, is the portrayal of Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />First: If you read the novels, you know that Lisbeth Salander was only 5 feet tall and weighed 90 lbs.  In the Swedish original, Noomi Rapace is actually 5'3" tall, and in the American remake Rooney Mara is 5'6".  Folks, there was a reason author Stieg Larsson made his heroine 5 feet tall.  He wanted this little girl to be a gallon of nitroglycerine read to explode -- like she did when she kicked ass on two Hells Angel types.  This was an essential part of the plot -- that someone so small, could be so violent.  Making her 5'6" loses this dramatic point.<br /><br />Second: Facially, in the novels, Lisbeth is not pretty, or would even be considered attractive on any level.  She is described as having a boyish figure and facial piercings.  This is accomplished in the Swedish version with Noomi Rapace -- nude, she is flat chested and her body and face are just so-so.  In bed she is not truly sexy or sensual -- she gets on, gets off, and is finished.  She does not make love.  The Swedish director deliberately cast this actress to accomplish this faithfulness to the novel.  The American director made Rooney Mara look -- at times -- beautiful.  She does not have a boyish body; she has a very young womanly body with normal size breasts. In bed, she is very attractive.  Very sexual, very sensual.  She makes love.  This is not Larsson's Lisbeth.<br /><br />Third: Psychologically, Lisbeth is an introvert who is filled with hostility.  In the Swedish version, the reporter slowly works his way into her confidence, and she (somewhat) lets her guard down for him.  The American version carries none of Lisbeth's borderline psychosis.  Rooney Mara, as Lisbeth, just "acts" like she is pissed off at the world.  It doesn't take much for the reporter to get her into bed.<br /><br />Conclusion: Stieg Larsson in his triolgy set himself a monumental task:  He asked himself, can I make a small unattractive girl, who is extremely introverted and hostile, and continually acts antisocial and like a bitch -- have the reader (audience) come to like (maybe love) her? This is a girl that we would never sit next to on a crowded bus -- but by the end of the novels (movie) we'd have her over for dinner.  Make no mistake, probably 90% of everyone who saw the Swedish film disliked this obnoxious character from the opening scenes, but by the end of the movie we were rooting for her.  The American version loses this quality of character.  Rooney Mara is tall, attractive, and her Lisbeth is not really super obnoxious or completely introverted.  Once again, her version of the character just "acts" pissed off.  The director missed the point.<br /><br />Sure, see both versions, and maybe read the books.  If you want Lisbeth Salander, you will only find her in the Swedish version.  The reviewers who thought the American version was as good or better than the Swedish version, did not understand the character of Lisbeth.</p></body></html>

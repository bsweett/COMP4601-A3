<meta name="summary" content="OK sequel"></head><body><p>The second film in the Planet of the Apes series is a reasonable sequel, but really lacking most of the originals zest and panache. Charlton Heston briefly reprises his role as Taylor, and in fact the opening to the film, is a reprise of the ending of the original, which is the best bit of the film. Heston reappears in the last 15 mins as well.<br /><br />With the surprise element lost (because of the ending of the first film), the sequel is mostly formulaic and limited to occasional good scenes. But none have the impact of Hestons first words to the Apes, or the impact of finding the Statue of Liberty on the beach in the original film.<br /><br />The special effects retain the same high standards as the first film for the apes, but the matt paintings used in the underground scenes now look obvious and dated. Brent as played by James Franciscus is effectively a Charlton Heston/Taylor look-a-like except he doesn't have the screen prescence that Heston brought to the Taylor role.<br /><br />So overall this is a decent film. Its a lot better than some of the later sequels, but not a patch on the original. Buy if cheap, or get it in the boxed set of 'Ape' films if the price is right.</p></body></html>

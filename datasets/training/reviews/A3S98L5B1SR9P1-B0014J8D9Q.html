The acting, directing, story, scenery is all A+. You can't help but like Eastwood's character and are eager to see him and Morgan Freeman ride off together to collect their last bounty. Gene Hackman's lawman is both calculating and chilling. Eastwood leaves a true legacy with this movie.</p></body></html>

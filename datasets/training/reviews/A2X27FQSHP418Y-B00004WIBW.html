<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic tale !"></head><body><p>Burton managed to make an outstanding picture, based on folklore, without being cheap or commercial. The movie is funny, fast-paced. The Headless Rider is a fearsome warrior, a kind of RPG Games warrior. Johhny Depp gives total credibility to Incabold Jones, the &quot;great&quot; technical detective. In the end there is some unforgettable humour scenes. Funny also is Walken, who doesn't speak a world the whole movie !  Great !</p></body></html>

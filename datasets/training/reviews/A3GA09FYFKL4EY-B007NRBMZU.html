<meta name="summary" content="This film shows how underrated Ashton Kutcher is as an actor"></head><body><p>Ignore "Dude, Where's My Car" and the campy pranks on Punk'd - Ashton Kutcher is first and foremost an actor, and it shows in this dark drama of a sex abuse survivor who struggles to change history to protect both himself and those he loves. An interesting premise based on the "if you could, should you try"? question of time travel and altering history. Kutcher's angst is excellent in this accurate portrayal of an abuse survivor.  The scenes of child molestation, while suggested and not shown, are deeply disturbing as they should be. Recommend for very mature audiences.</p></body></html>

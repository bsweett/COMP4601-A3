<meta name="summary" content="The kingdom of boredom"></head><body><p>Saudi Arabia looks like a cross between Vegas and Iraq in this incredibly illogical, boring film signed Peter Berg. Jamie Foxx does his best to look like Denzel Washington, and even succeeds to a large extent, but not even he can save this production. The only action scenes are in the beginning and at the end ("Abu Hamza, I presume?"), and the ending feels strangely lachrymose. Frankly, this is so bad that it only deserves one star, but since I don't like Wahhabis, I suppose I have to give it two. And now, a weather forecast!</p></body></html>

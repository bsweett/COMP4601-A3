<meta name="summary" content="QUAID AND GRACE PROVIDE GOOD COMPANY"></head><body><p>What's so refreshing about IN GOOD COMPANY is is lack of predictability and cloying sentimentality.  Dennis Quaid and Topher Grace are marvelous as the protagonists of the movie, and they get fine support from Marg Helgenberger and Scarlet Johannson.  The relationships that develop form the heart of the movie, and it is both comic and bittersweet.  Grace is a revelation as he captures the youth but competitive aggression of a new boss, and Quaid captures the frustration in having to work for someone half his age.  All in all, a very entertaining and well done film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Training Day" is very powerful and very intense!"></head><body><p>"Training Day" is among one of those films that you would have to watch very carefully to find out exactly what is going on throughout. And yet, it is so entertaining and so powerful that you would not believe Denzel Washington's performance in this movie until you have seen it! And speaking of his performance, you get to see a side of Denzel that you have never seen before...as the bad guy! That's right! Washington stars as veteran Detective Sargeant Alonzo Harris, a "lone wolf" cop that, to him, has spent too many years obeying the law, etc., that he goes over the edge (a.k.a. "crossing the line"). This film is also about a fresh-faced LAPD rookie named Jake Hoyt (an excellent Ethan Hawke), who is anxious to join the elite narcotics squad headed up by none other than Harris himself. So Harris has agreed to give Hoyt a shot at joining his team with a one-day ride-along during which Hoyt must prove his mettle if he wants to make it into narcotics. As the day wears on, however, it becomes increasingly clear to the greenhorn that Hoyt's experienced mentor has blurred the line between right and wrong to an alarming degree, enforcing his own morally compromised code of ethics and street justice. In conclusion, I would like to say that "Training Day" is nothing short of being intense. This is one of Denzel Washington's most frightening performances that I have seen on the big screen in a long time. And I would like to say this: "Denzel, please stick to the good guy roles. I know that this is a major change for you, but pleeeease stick to what you're really good at...and that's bringing out the good in you in any film that you make." "Training Day" is a great DVD addition to any Denzel Washington collection!</p></body></html>

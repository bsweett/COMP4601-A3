What I CAN decide is that this movie can be described as pure escapism. Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold Vosloo, Patricia Velasquez, and (even) The Rock have given fine performances. The special effects may be a bit too over-the-top but it's still marvelous to look at. Fast pace, fast adventures, and a different music score (this time it's Alan Silvestri and not Jerry Goldsmith) give feast for the eyes and ears. Watch this movie. It'll help you escape far far away.<br /><br />A-</p></body></html>

I was expecting to see a moderately entertaining class B film and discovered a hard, solid and intelligent cinematographic work.<br /><br />The story is quite complicate and requires the audience to be paying special attention.<br /><br />It starts showing Evan, a young boy, whose father is interned in a psychiatric institution and his mother is stressed fulfilling maternal and paternal roles.<br /><br />He is prone to suffer blackouts which left him without recollection of what happened pending them.<br /><br />The psychiatrist that had nursed his father is consulted and recommends him to keep a detailed diary as to enhance his memory.<br /><br />Several critical scenes with Evan passing out and covering a period of 15 years are shown.<br /><br />He finally gets into university, applies to study psychology and specializes in memory phenomena.<br /><br />Suddenly when reading his diary he is able to remember what happened that time, but not only that he actually "re-lived" the moment.<br /><br />That's the real kick-off the action. He is able to go back and change some critical fact (trying to suppress evil consequences). Well... those consequences ARE suppressed but a sort of new alternate universe emerges and... new awful events will occur or has already occurred.<br /><br />Evan doggedly goes back time and again, muddling everything up to the last desperate effort.<br /><br />The film is co-directed and co-wrote by Eric Bress & J. Mackey Gruber and they prove to be a good team in both aspects. I hope they'll keep this quality level in future releases.<br /><br />Playacting is compact and convincing. The group of kid & juvenile actors and actress keep a resemblance with the adult characters really astounding (I don't know if it was enhanced by make-up or other techniques).<br /><br />It is a shocking movie. Some scenes are revulsive but not gratuitously as I've seen in many recent films. So be aware of this situation in order to decide who will be able to see it and who don't.<br /><br />This is a highly recommended film for sci-fi aficionados and general public.<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

This kids film is some ballsy stuff. Ballsier than Apocalypse Now. OK, you may eviscerate me now!!<br /><br />Being a fan of Toy Story 1 and 2 when I was a kid, I knew I was in for a serious ride when I went to the 4 PM IMAX screening on opening day. As I walked into the the theater, I had to tell myself that this is it, this is the last Toy Story movie ever, that I will never see another Toy Story movie again. So as the movie began playing, I prepared myself to say goodbye to my favorite walking talking toys.<br /><br />This movie is simply a gem. I had anticipated it all the way back when I saw the trailer with Up. The whole theatre went "Oh COME ON!!!!" when they found out they had to wait a year to see it.<br /><br />Toy Story shows that Andy has grown up now, is going to college. The toys have been donated to a local daycare, which may seem like a happy place to all the other toys, but Woody can't shake the fact that the person he grew up with, Andy, is away from him now. Sunnyside Daycare has rowdy kids though, who do nothing but destroy the toys. Even worse, Lotso Huggin Bear, Ken, all the others seem nice, but are evil and cruel bastards. Furthermore, Buzz has been reprogrammed to be on Lotso's side. Oh no! The toys must reprogram him, and furthermore, get the HELL out of Sunnyside!!!<br /><br />The film is, in a word, spectacular. I was expecting it to suck, but surprise surprise!!! I loved this film. Great voice acting, great direction, animation is spectacular, and the best thing of the film? The darkness. One incredible scene is where the toys face death as they find themselves in the furnace near the end of the film. That scene had me on the edge of my seat, and hit me like a big bag of bricks. Just powerful, incredible stuff. And BOY did I cry like a baby at the end!!!<br /><br />Overall, it's time to say goodbye to Woody and Co, and TS3 is the perfect opportunity to do so.</p></body></html>

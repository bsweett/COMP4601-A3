<meta name="summary" content="fun korean monster movie."></head><body><p>This is a well made Korean monster movie. It's got humour and lots of great scenes. This is topnotch sci fi really and it's a fast paced movie. This was a hit movie in korea and was good enough to be shown over here. We need double features back because good movies like this one need a outlet here. The acting is very good too. On blu ray this looks great and it's a newer movie and that helps. It harkens back to the old monster on the loose movies and in this case the monster just wants to live actually. A fine flick that the korean's loved and so do I. It has english subtitles as well.</p></body></html>

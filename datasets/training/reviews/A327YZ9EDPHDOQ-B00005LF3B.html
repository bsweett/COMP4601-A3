<meta name="summary" content="One of Tom Hanks' best!"></head><body><p>Cast Away with Tom Hanks is the story of survival after a plane crash and the evential survival skills facing our hero in this movie. It puts the TV reality series "Survivor" to shame. Excellent film with its story line and the eventual rescue in the end. Not to be missed by the Tom's many fans! I enjoyed it!!</p></body></html>

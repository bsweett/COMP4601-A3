<meta name="summary" content="A Solid Thriller, But Not a Knock Out"></head><body><p>Doing a remake of a first class movie is asking for it. Not only should the remake be at least as good as the original, but the remake has to fight all the recollections of those who saw the original...and, I suspect, of a lot of the recollections of those who didn't.<br /><br />I thought that this remake did a first-class job for two-thirds of the way, but then lost it a bit. Even so, it's a solid movie in my view with a nice twist on the original.<br /><br />For me, the acting and emotional impact of the original centered on Angela Lansbury, followed by Sinatra and then Lawrence Harvey. In the remake, I'd put Washington first, followed by Schreiber and then Meryl Streep.<br /><br />The original seemed to me to be all about paranoia, and made all the more effective because Harvey, as an actor, had such a stand-offish personality. "It's not that Raymond Shaw is hard to like. He's impossible to like!" A lot of people felt the same way about Harvey. I think that's the main reason he was so effective in the role. That, combined with the poisonous ego and ruthlessness of Lansbury's role as the mother, made a real psycho study. Lansbury's kiss on her son's lips created, for me, a "Whoa, wait a minute" moment. Streep's approach to the kiss, but with it not shown, didn't have the same impact at all.<br /><br />The remake, for me, teetered more into relationships, with Washington more dominant in the movie, with Schreiber next and being more sympathetic and likeable, and with Streep being less poisonous and much funnier. If Lansbury with her performance stole the show in the original, Streep with her performance kind of set the remake off center. I thought the original ending, with Raymond's death and Sinatra speaking what Raymond's real medal of honor citation could have been, had a lot of emotional power. The remake's version (after the twist) was much more conventional.<br /><br />I hope this turns out to be a turning point for Liev Schreiber's film acting career. He's done a number of films but has never broken through. But the guy is a powerhouse stage actor who can handle anything from Shakespeare to Pinter, and regularly does. Everything I've read about him underlines how he can dominate a stage. Brainwashing is a little old hat nowadays, but Schreiber make's Raymond's situation believeable. He's an actor to keep an eye on.<br /><br />And while I think Meryl Streep's performance keeps the movie a bit off balance (its such a showboating turn), she genuinely is repellant, funny and scary all at the same time.<br /><br />Richard Condon wrote the book these movies were based on. If you enjoy paranoia, read another of his books, Winter Kills. It's a good read, and made a good movie.</p></body></html>

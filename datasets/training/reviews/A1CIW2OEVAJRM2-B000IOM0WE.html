<meta name="summary" content="A female James bond in a futuristic cyberpunk era"></head><body><p>Based on what was orginally an animated series of violent and sexually explicit cartoons, it's well been said that the heroine Aeon Flux is pretty much a female James Bond in an futuristic cyberpunk era.  Aeon lives in an apocalyptic setting, where the world has been decimated by a fatal virus and the 5 million survivors have been living for 400 years in an enclave called Bresna under the leadership of the Goodchild family that saved it.  But conflict emerges when members of the populace start strangely disappearing, and an underground resistance force known as Monicans emerges, in an attempt to assassinate the current leader of the Goodchild clan.  Aeon Flux gets the assignment to take out Goodchild, but in the process makes some startling discoveries that cause her to rethink which side she's on.<br /><br />The primary focus of the film is an action drama, with Aeon Flux and her fellow characters getting lots of camera time doing all kinds of cartwheels and handsprings in the modern setting that is their playground.  It's been said of the animated protagonist that she is "provocative, sexy, and acrobatic" - and that's exactly the way Aeon comes to life on the screen as well.  The film was pleasantly free of the crude humor or vulgar language that tends to be combined with this kind of character and action, but expect to see some sexual connotations (with a strong feminine character like Aeon, how can you not?), and lots of violence.  Although most of the victims are faceless, there were occasions where the blood and gore forced me to look away, and it's not surprising that the film got the PG-13 rating it did for this reason.  If the two main protagonists came across somewhat emotionless, they made up for it with the energy of their action and the destruction they cause, particularly Aeon's superhuman acrobatics.<br /><br />The action is backed by a relatively interesting, if not simple plot, which raises some interesting intellectual questions about contemporary ethical issues, cloning in particular.  In a world where the entire population has become infertile, Trevor Goodchild's quest is to find a way for normal pregnancies to happen, but his brother thinks that the status quo where the human race can only be perpetuated by cloning is a utopia that needs no change.  Perhaps nowhere is this better articulated than in the closing stages of the film, where the question is raised about whether a form of immortality achievable through cloning is superior than to a mortal life.  Aeon says: "We're meant to die. It's the only thing that makes things matter. ... To live once for real, and then give way to people who might do better. To live only once, but with hope."  The implication seems to be that even if human cloning were ever to be successful, it wouldn't make human life more valuable than it is at present, even with its mortality.<br /><br />This kind of dialogue seems to raise deep questions on an important contemporary issue, and even hints at a moral stand against cloning.  But in reality the film only scratches the surface of it, and never really addresses these serious questions except for raising them in a somewhat vague manner at the very end.  Not that it matters - in the end Aeon Flux is really about cool looking fight scenes and a futuristic spectacle with intense action sequences.  And in the process, like much other science fiction, it shows the illusion of a utopian dream, namely that even if cloning does hold the promise of utopia, it would still result in a world where humans are inherently flawed.  Cloning won't redeem humanity, and Aeon Flux won't redeem the genre of science fiction, but it's a fun ride.  While it lacks substance, but it's still reasonable entertainment.  - GODLY GADFLY</p></body></html>

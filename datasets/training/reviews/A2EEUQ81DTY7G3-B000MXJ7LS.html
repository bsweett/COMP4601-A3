In this evocative reenactment of that fateful day, the director uses a lot of restraint, consequently we hear the planes hit the buildings but we never see them and we see the people racing from the scene bloodied and battered, and we also get the immense scale of the disaster through a spectacularly recreated set piece.<br /><br />With moderation and tact, Hollywood sentimentality is largely kept at bay, as the viewer is swept into a very personal account of what it must have been like to be trapped inside the wreckage and rubble of the giant towers.  The movie opens on the morning of September 11th and it's just like any other day in New York, the sun comes up, the Fulton Fish Market opens for business, and commuters get on the train or the Staten Island Ferry.<br /><br />Two Port Authority cops, Sgt. John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Officer Will Jimeno (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) go to work but little do they know what was to become of them that day. A tremor is felt in the P.A.'s offices within the World Trade Center, followed by confusion as McLoughlin leads his men from the Port Authority bus terminal toward the towers. They thread through fallen debris with the intent of evacuating office workers,<br /><br />McLoughlin, Jimeno and three others get to the concourse between the towers. Then the columns buckle, the first tower begins to collapse and the men are trapped. Their wives - Donna McLoughlin (Maria Bello) and pregnant Allison Jimeno (Maggie Gyllenhaal), along with thousands of other families have know idea where they are and what has happened to their husbands and scenes alternate between the trapped survivors who are trying desperately to stay awake and alive and their families who anxiously wait by the phone.<br /><br />The acting in this movie, particularly by Gyllenhaal and Bello is quite phenomenal - no mad histrionics here, just a deep anxiousness, confusion and sadness as both wives try to cope with the magnitude of the disaster in different ways. Donna sort of shuts down and goes into a state of temporal denial, whilst Allison ponders how she can begin to raise her children without a father.<br /><br />World Trade Center is far from a gripping and fast-paced thriller, and it doesn't glamorize or even cheapen the events of that day, rather the drama comes from how these men survived - keeping each other's spirits up when they were pinned down in pain and suffering internal bleeding. And these scenes, shot in a re-creation of Ground Zero masterfully built by production designer Jan Roelfs, are simple and direct in their concentration on the immobilized policemen.<br /><br />I have just one problem with this movie and that was the decision to cast Nicolas Cage as Sgt. McLoughlin. Maybe I'm biased, but I just didn't buy him playing a Port Authority Cop, his performance, especially in the opening scenes come across as a little forced. Still, the movie as a whole is generally well done with Stone successfully anchoring us in the chaos of ground zero.<br /><br />World Trade Center certainly isn't out to make a political statement about terrorism or the inaction of the government leading up to the disaster and the only view of the outside world comes from Cable TV which becomes a refrain of information feeds and sober political analysis, including a brief speech from the President.  But Stone is largely determined that his movie be about all of us, showing how these events happened to everyone, everyday people doing their jobs and living their lives.

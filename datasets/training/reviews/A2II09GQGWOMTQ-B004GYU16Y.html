<meta name="summary" content="Salt is a solid action/spy movie."></head><body><p>I knew this movie was Angelina Jolie doing the James Bond thing...sort of.<br />When I popped the DVD in it gave me three options.<br />"Theatrical Version"<br />"Director's Cut"<br />And the version I ended up watching "Extended Cut".<br /><br />Jolie turns in a great performance along with the rest of the cast.<br />Solid direction.<br />A decent score.<br />Pacing was spot on.<br />The only thing I found a little disappointing as I do with all films like this is how unrealistic it is.<br />Jolie and crew simply walk away from accidents and falls that would kill anyone without so much as a scratch and not a hair out of place.<br /><br />That minor gripe aside, the film is a blast.<br />Great popcorn movie that doesn't require a lot of thought.<br />I give it my recommendation.</p></body></html>

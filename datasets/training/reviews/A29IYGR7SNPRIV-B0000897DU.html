Eminem is nothing less than wonderful in his first starring role and brings surprising energy and intelligence to his role as would-be rapper Rabbit. Everything about the film feels right, feels authentic--including the rivalries and the affection shared by Rabbit and his friends. The big bonus is Kim Basinger (who owns an academy award for L.A. Confidential--for reasons not at all clear to me) who pulls out all the stops and turns in a stunningly gritty performance here as Rabbit's slow-witted, beer-swilling, man-hungry trailer park mother. This film doesn't feel artificial in any way; all the sets seem realer than real and the aura of poverty is almost tangible. While the story of a young man with a dream isn't anything new, the script, the performances and Eminem elevate it beyond the ordinary. And big points have to go to the non-Hollywood ending. Reality is winning the day and then catching a bus to go back to work.<br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

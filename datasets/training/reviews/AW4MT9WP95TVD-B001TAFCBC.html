It is so creative and romantic and beautifully acted that I was riveted to the screen.  Carrey - who usually makes me really crabby - is just great here.  I can't even describe how this film finally changed my opion of him.  Winslet is like a piece of of eternal sunshine, Dunst, Ruffalo, et al. are each excellent.  This movie is funny, moving, suspenseful and romantic all in one. Beautifully filmed and with a great score, I can't recommended this one enough.</p></body></html>

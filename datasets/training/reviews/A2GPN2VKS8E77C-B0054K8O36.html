<meta name="summary" content="After The Curse Of The Black Pearl, Dead Man's Chest And At World's End, What Else Can Happen? Sail On Stranger Tides, Of Course"></head><body><p>Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />Thus far in my travels with the Pirates Of The Caribbean, I've experienced The Curse Of The Black Pearl, opened the Dead Man's Chest, and sailed the weird and haunted shores At World's End. So, when the opportunity arose for me to set sail once again On Stranger Tides, how could I resist? Personally, I enjoy all three previous entries in the series, with my only complaint being that there are no deleted scenes on the DVD of Dead Man's Chest (some scenes were filmed, but ultimately cut; I think it's always nice to include deleted scenes from a movie and know why they were excised, as some think the scenes were absolutely neccessary whlle others might might not, but enjoy seeing them nonetheless), and only two deleted scenes were included on the DVD of At World's End (I know that twenty minutes worth of footage was cut from the film, including a scene where Admiral Norrington tries to persuade Governor Swann from killing Davy Jones, and for some reason, those twenty minutes were not included on the DVD as deleted or extended scenes). But I digress.<br /><br />This latest voyage with the Pirates Of The Caribbean is another gold mine for Walt Disney Pictures. The twists keep on coming, there's still action & romance a-plenty, and of course, a dash of rougish charm. Captain Jack is back, and this time, he's joined by yet another lovely young lady who is easy on the eyes (as well as a good actress), and Barbossa has apparently switched sides. As with the previous films, the plot is very engaging, and you're never bored for a moment. The score is excellent, remeniscent of the first three movies while incorporating new themes as well.<br /><br />Biblically speaking, there is barely any offensive content, as is usual with Disney films, and consistent with the previous three movies. There is violence, but as expected, it is never graphic and mostly bloodless. There's one moderate imprecation used (during the film's climax), but it's appropriate, given the situation. And of course, there is the innuendo, but given that it's a pirate film, but a Disney movie at heart, it's always light and humorous. I admit, I had my reservations about the mermaids when I saw the trailer (I thought, "Do they HAVE to be topless? This is a DISNEY movie.") As it turns out, my reservations were unnecessary, as the screenwriters and director were discreet in filming the scenes with the mermaids. Nothing is shown. There is a Christian missionary in the film, and he is portrayed in a positive light, unusual for a non-Christian movie, but of course very commendable. Though he IS on the receiving end of some light-hearted quips, his calling is never disrespected, and as per the previous movies, God's name is never taken in vain. (It's a Disney film, and with the disappointing exception of the recently released John Carter, which I have not seen, Disney has respected the Name of God, at least when it comes to their movies; in television, that's another story). SPOILER ALERT!!! As in the previous entries, Jack sacrifices his own selfish desire to do what he knows in his heart is the right thing to do. SPOILER ALERT OVER!!! I highly recommend that you accept this latest invitation to sail with the Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.<br /><br />I think the film could have been rated PG.</p></body></html>

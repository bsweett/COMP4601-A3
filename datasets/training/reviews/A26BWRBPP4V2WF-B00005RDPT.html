<meta name="summary" content="A classic popcorn movie - poor DVD edition"></head><body><p>Perhaps understandably, Steven Soderbergh wished to make a film for the fun of it, after his more serious and critically aclaimed Traffic and Erin Brokovich.  With that criterion, Soderbergh succeeds beautifully - this is a fun film, a popcorn movie in the best sense of the term.  Unfortunately, it doesn't quite pull itself up enough to be a film that one would wish to watch over and over.<br /><br />The story - Danny Ocean, newly released from prison, hatches a plot to rob the vault at a Vegas casino, estimated to be worth 150 million.  He gathers 10 associates to help and we're provided with a complex but not complicated plan to break into the vault and more importantly, to escape with the loot.  To Soderbergh's credit, he keeps us guessing as to how the plan will ultimately unfold, and his solution is both deceptively simple and elegant, without cheating (a VERY important point!).<br /><br />However, Soderbergh's most important contribution is his reputation as a director, enabling him to bring in big names for relatively small parts.  This makes the film work, as the audience immediately recognises the actors and can therefore keep each character straight in his/her mind.  With 11 heist plotters, plus the casino owner and his girlfriend, gives 13 major characters - quite a number for a 2-hour film!  In fact, much of the fun is provided by the performances - Brad Pitt (for my money, the best actor of his generation), Julia Roberts (arguably the biggest movie star in the world), Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner, Andy Garcia, Matt Damon, etc., etc., etc.  George Clooney, the putative #1 star, makes no attempt to hog screen time and all seem happy to be part of the ensemble.<br /><br />But..... The film never really rises above its genre.  It's fun, but you don't take it home with you.  Enjoy it for the couple hours it runs, but it's unlikely to leave much lasting impression.  Part of that is because there's no reason to buy this DVD.  It consists solely of a 15-minute making-of featurette (possibly the most annoying, self-agrandising featurette I've seen in years!) and 2 audio commentaries.  The one by Soderbergh and his screenwriter is informative, but the second, by Andy Garcia, Matt Damon, and Brad Pitt, is the only real reason to buy the DVD - it's almost as much fun as the film itself.  (Pitt, especially, seems to have taken an interest in doing commentaries, and I welcome actors' contributions to them).</p></body></html>

A nice film all around."></head><body><p>When a normal taxi cab driver winds up with a hired assassin you would think it would be non-stop action for the whole film.  Yet it is not, and that is one of the great aspects of this movie.  Jamie Foxx plays the average guy, a taxi cab driver with hopes and dreams that he understands will never be his.  Cruise plays the calm yet calculating killer who is just trying to get a job done.  We can relate to Fox's character the most, but, like Reservoir Dogs, redemption is the theme here. Redemption in the sense that both characters try to explain to each other, and themselves, why they do what they do only to get a better understanding of their mediocre life.  Both are given the power to change their life, but the story is really whether one will.<br /><br />The director, Michael Mann, adds to the story with offbeat camerawork, including a lot of hand held shots used with a lesser quality camera.  This gives the movie a more distinctive feel, while the great music overtones Cruise's and Foxx's characters life with mellow serenity.  Actually my favorite part is not the action, yet instead it is the three or so minutes where Michael Mann just does some beautiful shots, all while an Audioslave song, Shadow of the Sun, plays over.  Michael Mann repeats that same kind of filming later too.<br /><br />In summary, Collateral, is not too quick action wise, has very little "gore", and has no twists in it.  That is because this is a more intelligently done action film, with great characters, cinematography, and a beautiful score.  I feel that Collateral is definitely deserved of some Oscars.</p></body></html>

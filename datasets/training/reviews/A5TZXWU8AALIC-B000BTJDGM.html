<meta name="summary" content="A Solid Supernatural Thriller with no easy answers"></head><body><p>Most of this film is structured as a courtroom drama.  It begins just after the death of Emily Rose in the home of her shattered family as the priest who was acting as her exorcist is arrested by the police.<br /><br />A very intriguing opening.<br /><br />And there's no actress better than Laura Linney as the defense attorney hired to defend the priest in a negligent homicide trial.  As Emily's story is told in flashbacks during the trial's testimony, the viewer, like Linney's character, begins to realize that the most unbelievable aspect of the case--that demons and evil exist outside of ourselves--might just be at the bottom of the case.<br /><br />Excellent performances from everyone, sharp writing.  This film doesn't have the overwhelming dread that THE EXORCIST left with audiences but its ambition is a little more involved: it asks questions for the audience to answer for themselves.<br /><br />If you're looking for an artless, empty slaughter house of a horror movie, then move on.  There are plenty of slasher and zombie fests out there.<br /><br />But if you're looking for an intelligent, well-made film that doesn't limit itself to one side or another, then check this one out.</p></body></html>

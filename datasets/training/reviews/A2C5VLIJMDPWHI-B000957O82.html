<meta name="summary" content="Will Smith did it"></head><body><p>This movie was unrealistic in some parts (who buys someone something as expensive as scuba gear on a first date or lets a person come to THEIR house after they have an allergy attack) but other than that, the movie was unstoppable. It was hilarious, it was a realistic view at the dating scene (minus the above antics), and Will Smith carried this movie all the way through.  I enjoy any movie he's in, to be honest with you. But I don't think the movie would've been good without him.</p></body></html>

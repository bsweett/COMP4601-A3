<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly better than I had expected"></head><body><p>Going into the Fantastic Four movie, I'll admit that I expected something completely abysmal.  However, with so many of the comic to film adaptations trying to be serious and move beyond their source material (i.e. Superman Returns), sometimes it's better to have a comic book movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and just sets out to be something that many films of this type aren't: fun.  And Fantastic Four is certainly mindless fun all the way.  Scientist Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), his ex-girlfriend Sue Storm (a blonde haired and blue contact lens wearing Jessica Alba), her daredevil brother Johnny (Chris Evans), and Reed's longtime friend Ben Grimm (The Shield's Michael Chiklis) are all transformed into the super powered team, who find their hands full with instant celebrity and their evil, super powered nemesis Victor Von Doom (Nip/Tuck's Julian McMahon).  The CGI effects are in full effect, the action is campy, and the cast is game (Chris Evans is a nice pick as the hotshot Human Torch), while the makeup and costume effects for the Thing are very well done.  It's loaded with leaps in logic and plot points which are laughable, but that's part of the film's appeal, and that's always been part of the comic's sense of appeal as well.  It works to a point, and Fantastic Four is a fun trip as long as you don't take it seriously or expect anything such as the lofty heights set by X2: X-Men United or Spider-Man 2.  Look for Marvel icon Stan Lee in a humerous cameo.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="DiCaprio the Mercenary"></head><body><p>I thought this was a pretty good movie but I also think it was limited and pretty sappy. Leonardo DiCaprio was very good as the young mercenary. Djimon Hounsou has a good look but I don't think he is a very good actor beyond that. Jennifer Connelly is the same. She is not a very good actress. This movie does expose or bring to the mainstream public the story of the blood diamond trade. That is commendable. But I think it got to be a bit sappy and a bit of a 'feel good' movie. I enjoyed it for the most part but think it was kind of unrealistic in its hollywood feel good 'happy ending'.</p></body></html>

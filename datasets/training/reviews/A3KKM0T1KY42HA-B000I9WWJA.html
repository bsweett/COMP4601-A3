<meta name="summary" content="Lee's Best Since Malcolm X"></head><body><p>Denzel Washington comes through for Spike Lee again in this awesome thriller. And Denzel is joined by other A-listers like Jodie Foster, Clive Owen, Willem Defoe and Christopher Plummer in this extremely well-done bank robbery movie...seemingly.<br /><br />Seemingly is the key word here. The robbers are trapped inside the bank and take hostages. As the situation escalates, Denzel's hostage negotiator character discovers that, as he says in the movie trailer, "this is no bank robbery", and the details of the criminal's more "perfect heist" are revealed.<br /><br />Spike Lee clearly has the talent to put together a classy, well executed action movie, and he will hopefully devote more of his talent to these kinds of films, because Inside Man really works.</p></body></html>

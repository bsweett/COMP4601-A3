It's missing something that the others had. It seems like it has a different screen-writer and I also missed Danny Elfman. When the film was being filmed I remember reading something about him actually never wanting to work with Sam Raimi again for some reason. So he's not back even if you do hear some of his original score here and there. I also think the story is sort of a mess, too much happening it once. It's sorta messy. I read the novel based on the movie before the movie came out and it's surprisingly more solid in some cases. I mean the stuff with the Sandman is better done in it and we understand him a bit more. The screenplay itself isn't developed well. It has it's scenes of emotion that do work but most of them come at the end.<br /><br />  Yes we have scenes with crying and argueing but that can be more annoying than it's entertaining. Kirsten Dunst for instance, she rarely smiles in this movie! She just accuses Peter of stuff through-out and whines about her acting career. Oh of course she gets taken by the bad guys once again too. Bryce Dallas Howard looks her best ever! as Gwen Stacey and she's not even developed much. She's just around to make Mary Jane jealous but the film could've used more of her. She's fresh to the movies and at least is happy and doesn't complain. Plus James Cromwell (Babe) is a great actor but he's pretty wasted as well as Captain Stacy, Gwen's father.<br /><br />  People complained that Topher Grace wasn't built enough to play Eddie Brock. Yes he's mis-casted but that's in style these days, I mean you have Heath Ledger playing Joker in the next Batman film for god's sake. I think Topher does a fine job even if I do think he would've been a great Spiderman if Tobey didn't come back. Through most the movie he has nothing to do but run around with a camera. When he becomes Venom he's awesome and Venom is awesome but he's not in the film enough. When you have 3 villians, Venom should of course take up most of the movie but he doesn't. We have Peter wearing the costume through a lot of the movie and when he does his hair turns black but no one even mentions once how odd it is that his hair keeps turning color back and forth. Anyway I guess that's not that important lol. The black costume is mostly used to show how Peter lets hate take over him and how it's not good to let hate take over. I would've preferred more of Eddie Brock as Venom though.<br /><br />  The film has a lot of too many simple flaws. We're supposed to believe that the Sandman just does bad stuff for his daughter. Yet the script just has him looking at her pic all the time and she's not used the way she is in the novel based on the movie. The Sandman's emotional scene in the end just sorta comes out of nowhere. It was actually done better in the book  since you had the daughter involved. Plus you also had a part in the book where he turns into a sand castle for his daughter. The movie could've used that too. Instead he never gets to have as big of a presence as the Green Goblin or Doc Ock. Plus like I said, I liked Topher Grace as Eddie Brock but he wasn't used enough either. But unlike in the book it's never explained why he knows stuff about Peter and Spiderman now that he has the stuff on.<br /><br />  I admit that the Harry Osborne stuff isn't done that bad though. Eventhough he has memory loss through most the movie and forgets that he blames Peter for his father's death. I've seen too much convenient memory loss in Smallville to wanna see it in Spiderman too lol. But I think the drama involving him is one of the stronger things the movie has going for it. Tobey Maguire is a good actor but in some scenes he didn't even look like he got in shape for the movie. I mean people have knocked Topher's built but he even looked in better shape. Tobey looked so bad in some scenes that I feared for his health. He has some scenes that he's really good and some that his heart barely seems like it's into the movie. Kirsten Dunst seems like her heart is barely into as well. Still though unlike 2 critics on Ebert & Roeper I can't just give the film a careless thumbs down! It's not the best, but it's just not a bad movie either. It's at least a better 3rd movie than X-3 was. But Sam Raimi maybe needs to read more of the comics and try to get his head back in the game because he barely seemed like he was there this time around as well.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It stunk"></head><body><p>This is a movie about two guys who love to do drugs and, while high, develop a craving for a certain fast food burger. On their journey to get these burgers they do more and more drugs. This only makes them happier. One of them even has a dream where he marries a bag of marijuana. In the end, they set out to get more drugs. I'd say these two young men have a problem. But drugs only seem to add fun and adventure to these guys so why not? I didn't find most of this movie to be funny. Potty humor, gay jokes, and racist jokes aren't what I call entertainment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="To preserve the essential scents to immortalize the memories!"></head><body><p>This is a very original film, based on the exacerbation of the smell, and impelled o unsuspected heights. Based on the famous best seller of Patrick Susskind, the cinematographic proposal was very satisfactory. This promising director handled with secure hand and firm conviction this weird story about a human being with a visible lack of affection and tender (since the moment he was born) who found his bliss through the pleasure of enjoying and even to recognize the most unexpected scents and, to separate them and back to join them in new and attractive proposals.<br /><br />The suspenseful frame I which the movie undertakes is filled of daring camera work and so the edition process and the enigmatic presence of this strange collector of scents and something else that you must find out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The King of the Spoof Scores Again!"></head><body><p>It's a funny thing about comedy; it seems to be of and for its time and very few age very well.  I remember as a kid when I first watched this film that I laughed until I cried.  Then I watched it again a few years ago and I absolutely hated it.  Now after having watched the original Frankenstein movies upon which this spoof is based, I actually like it again as I can compare and see exactly what scene from the original is being spoofed although I have to admit that many of the jokes don't pack as much of a punch as they did when I first watched this film.<br /><br />This is why I really respect some of the older comedians that can still get a laugh out of me after many, many years such as some of Buster Keaton's (Sherlock Jr.) and especially Charlie Chaplin's work (Modern Times, City Lights, The Gold Rush, The Great Dictator etc) not to mention the Marx Brothers (Duck Soup, and the other movies)too.  I've come to realise that as much as I enjoyed and laughed at scenes from "Meet the Parents" and "Something About Mary" for example that future generations will probably wonder what the fuss was all about just like the way many of the reviewers with negative reviews feel about this film.  That's why I'm convinced you cannot have a "funniest comedy of all time!" as the dvd cover claims here because what is funny for one generation very rarely remains so for another.<br /><br />Still, this was enjoyable and if you actually go back and watch all the original Frankenstein movies from the very good first two to the much less so others, you'll appreciate this spoof a whole lot more.  Marty Feldman made this film for me as he was still really funny in his role as Igor although the entire cast was excellent and Teri Garr kept reminding me that she was the original Phoebe of "Friends" fame in terms of mannerisms and behaviour.<br /><br />The dvd itself has a few good special features such as a making of documentary and a few interviews but the sound quality is only in Mono and the picture quality hasn't been restored and while ordinarily this would be something to complain about but as Wilder wanted this film to closely resemble the original Frankenstein films one can't really complain as these "imperfections" actually achieve the director's goal so to speak.<br /><br />One of the first great spoofs and certainly funny when it first came out and when I first watched it but now to be fair like most comedies, it has lost much of its hilarity but it is still amusing and very enjoyable if you are also a fan of the old Frankenstein movies.</p></body></html>

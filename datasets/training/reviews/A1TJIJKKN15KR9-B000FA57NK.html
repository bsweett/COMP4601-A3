Backed by an all-star cast and an excellent script, it's a lesson in efficient, powerful big-event storytelling. Tom Hanks and Ed Harris are especially convincing as commander of the crippled spacecraft and the flight director in charge of his safe return, respectively. Like you might expect from a Hanks / Howard collaboration, it has more than its share of soft-hearted emotions, but a good sense of humor and convincing special effects help to compensate.</p></body></html>

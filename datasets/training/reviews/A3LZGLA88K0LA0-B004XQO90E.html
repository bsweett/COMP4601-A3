In both films, the hero does anything to protect the woman he loves.  In CODE, Jake Gylenhaal is a soldier who is assigned the task of preventing a terrorist attack on a commuter train in Chicago, which will result in the death of his girl friend, Michelle Monaghan.  This is accomplished by a secret government agency's "source code"---a device that gives Jake 8 minute time segments to find the bomb and the terrorist.<br />Director Duncan Jones elicits good performances from his leads, as well as Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright as the government agents controlling Jake.  Jones focuses on the people instead of producing an action film, and that's commendable.<br />SOURCE CODE is certainly a well-made film, but its predictable in its finale, and I found myself somewhat confused at the ending.  Since I don't want to spoil anything, I can't go into further detail, but I can't say SOURCE CODE is a great film, but it is enjoyable.</p></body></html>

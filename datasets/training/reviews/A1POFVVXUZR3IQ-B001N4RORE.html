I grew up on ABBA's music as my parents were fans and remember singing and dancing to "Dancing Queen" when I was seven (such memories!). I have loved ABBA ever since, and it was only recently that I actually got to watch the movie (sadly, on DVD, as I missed it during its theater run). Though the actors do not remotely resemble (nor sing like) the singers of ABBA, they more than make up for it with genuine chemistry and camaraderie. A viewer can tell these actors had great fun during the production of this musical/movie and their fun is incredibly infectious! I sang out loud and even danced to the old, familiar, classic songs, and had so much fun! The main cast is made up of famous actors - the incomparable Meryl Streep (who really showcases her beautiful singing voice here), the svelte Christine Baranski, and Julie Walters (I remember her most from her role as Mrs Weasley in the Harry Potter movie franchise), Pierce Brosnan (yes, he does not exactly have a great singing voice, but who cares???), Colin Firth (whose performance as Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice left an indelible impression on me), Stellan Skarsgaard, and the two young and talented actors, Amanda Seyfried as Sophie, and Dominic Cooper as her fiance, Sky (the pair are a real-life couple and reportedly began dating on the set of the movie).<br /><br />The story begins with 20-year-old Sophie Sheridan who discovers that any one of three men (Brosnan, Firth, or Skarsgaard) could be her father. Wishing to have her father (Sophie was raised by her mother,Donna played by Meryl Streep) walk her down the aisle at her wedding to Sky (Dominic Cooper), Sophie invites all three men to her wedding. The clueless Donna invites her two former backup singers to the wedding (Baranski and Walters), and when she sees the three men from her past, all hell breaks loose, and so does the music! The plot is quite thin, and the characters are not explored in-depth here - but the focal point of the movie is the music. The plot revolves around the music, and the lively dance numbers showcase great choreography. The fashion is reminiscent of ABBA's heyday and the costumes are in a riot of colors - all in all, pure rip-roaring fun!<br /><br />This is a fun movie that brings back nostalgic memories. I will be adding this to my DVD collection.Someday, I hope to watch the Broadway musical.</p></body></html>

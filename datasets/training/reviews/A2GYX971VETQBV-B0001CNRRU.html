<meta name="summary" content="Inarritu and Penn Do It Again"></head><body><p>_21 Grams_ is another recent testament to the skill of Sean Penn.  What has happened to Penn in the last few years?  Something went off inside of his head and he decided to start really giving it to us, showing us once again that an actor can find himself well into his prime.  Benicio Del Toro is electrifying, as always, in his portrayal of a born-again Christian.  Director Alejandro Inarritu is on his game in this film.  While many have complained about the story's progression, as it flips back and forth out-of-sequence and does not follow a linear plotline, I believe that the story would have suffered without this chaotic format.  From the first few minutes of the film, the audience knows where this train wreck is headed: the gripping part, however, is sitting there in your seat watching as these two storylines are rushing towards one another.  Not only does this type of sequencing keep the audience mentally engaged, it adds to the sense of chaos and unpredictability of the plotline, immersing the viewer inside of this world.  In fact, like many films shot in this manner, if you had seen the film according to the linear timeline, the story would have been somewhat ordinary and boring.<br /><br />That all being said, I must say that I was somewhat disappointed with _21 Grams_.  Let's put it this way: I love non-linear sequencing, but there are other films out there that do a much better job.  The storyline of this film is a bit too mixed up, with gaps that leave one wondering about motivation on the actor's part.  After the film was over, I just sat there and said, "All right...it's over now."  While still an outstanding film, I feel that it fails to hit the mark dead center.  In the end, the acting is still tremendously strong in this film and I highly recommend it, if only to see Sean Penn in another brilliant performance of the year.</p></body></html>

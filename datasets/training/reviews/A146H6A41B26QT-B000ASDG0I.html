This is a pretty typical shoot-'em-up spy caper, with some amusing bits in the therapist's office as the two go for marriage counseling. But the sparks fly the minute these two get into the same room together. Otherwise quite predictable--definitely for an evening of very, very light entertainment.</p></body></html>

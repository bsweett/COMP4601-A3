<meta name="summary" content="A Sexy, Exciting Thriller"></head><body><p>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star in this action-packed thriller about a rather unorthodox married couple who have very unique occupations.<br /><br />Pitt and Jolie star as John and Jane Smith.  Both are attending marriage counseling to work out the problems in their marriage.  Jane works with computers, while John works as an architect with his friend Eddie (Vince Vaughn).  They have dinner each night at 7 pm, and neither has much to say.  They live in a nice neighborhood and have friendly neighbors.  But in reality, there is much more than meets the eye.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to each other, both are cooly lethal, highly-paid assassins working for rival organizations.  They are both assigned the same target, Benjamin Danz (Adam Brody).  Both John and Jane show up at the intercept point, but in reality, Benjamin was being used as bait to draw out both John and Jane.  The organizations have found out that the two are married, and there are orders to kill both of them.<br /><br />Jane soon discovers that John was the one who foiled her attempt to get Benjamin, now she has set her sights on taking out her husband.  What happens now is a battle among husband and wife to see who will survive. Will John manage to escape from his wife?  Will they both realize that they are being used as bait in a much larger inter-organizational battle?  Will John and Jane join forces to save each other?<br /><br />I thought this was a very good movie.  The story is very well-conceived.  There are lots of action scenes, along with guns, knives, explosives, and narrow escapes.  There's even an elevator that crashes to the ground from the top of a building. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are perfect together, and the film will keep you on your toes throughout.  I highly recommend this action-packed movie.  This movie gives new meaning to "till death do us part".</p></body></html>

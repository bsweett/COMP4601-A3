During one of the scenes I actually jumped and my candy fell on the floor. That how intense the movie was.<br /><br />Just watching the scenes where the military are brainwashing the soldiers - is so frightening and scary. When I left the movie, I was saying to myself "Now that was scary". Just the Sci-fi elements added to the brainwashing techniques were amazing.<br /><br />Meryl Streep gives an outstanding performance as the over-bearing political mother who will do anything to get her son elected to office. But I think at Oscar time Liev Schreiber will be on everyone's list. He certainley does an excellant job portraying the brainwashed political candidate. Denzel is also great as the military man who is the one that figures out the truth of what is going on.<br /><br />One of the best and most suspenseful movies of the Summer.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Three Lives. One Train. Dylanesque Experiences."></head><body><p>The film explores sense of adventure above retapping brotherhood. There is something exceedingly self confident about The Darjeeling Limited. The first scene features a chase to catch a train and the first of the three actors to appear is Adrien Brody. Adrien Brody is the apparently the most comfortable,yet clumsy of the three stars in this film. Brody's demeanour as Peter is remarakble and the prescription sunglasses were humored.<br /><br />Owen Wilson. Well, I won't lie. After the controversy that surrounded the man in recent times and his personal struggles, I wanted to see this film even more. It is his most memorable performance and he truly is a star in this film, a bit like a big brother figure what have you. Overall, it felt good to see him back on his feet chasing trains and electric plugs (you'll know)<br /><br />Jascon Schwartzman. He surprises me with how well an underplayer of an actor he is. Whether it's frantically chasing an Indian woman or running down a hill or even masterfully causing fire, his character wins. I loved how he carried his music around and had not a word to speak.<br /><br />Combine these three, some sweet coffees, temples cigarettes, band aids, pills, eyedrops, cough medicines, liquor, electric plugs, Indian villagers, coolies (the guys who lift your baggage at trainstations across India), shrines, BILL MURRAY, canals, cricket with tennis balls, funerals, young Indian boys and big hearts,  , taxis, fellow Sikhs, peacock feathers, phoney spiritualism, poisonous snakes, a Laurel and Hardy'ish willingness to fight...and much more - the movie prevails as one of quality and comradery in adventure.<br /><br />Overall, a heatening effort, must watch.</p></body></html>

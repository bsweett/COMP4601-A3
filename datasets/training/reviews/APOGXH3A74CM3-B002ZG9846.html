<meta name="summary" content="Hit Girl Is It"></head><body><p>I caught this on netflix, and have to say I was taken by surprise.  I was expecting a kid's superhero movie, but this sure isn't that.  Sure, it's a bit campy, but that's what's going to make this a classic in a few years.  I'm not going to give too much away.  This is a violent action film, and it's all about Hit Girl.... watch and you'll see.<br /><br />And Kick Ass, well he does... in a final act of redemption.</p></body></html>

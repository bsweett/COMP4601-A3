<meta name="summary" content="A bit lacking in character development."></head><body><p>Well, I too, like others, really wanted to enjoy this film.  So I went out and bought it to add to my Western collection, and gearing up for May's release of Wyatt Earp, I sat down to watch it.  <p>Well the cinemaphotography was good, considering that it was shot around Calgary, Alberta.  The two main characters were well developed.  Probably too much really.  But the secondary characters and most importantly the villians had very little character development.  So when the final gun battle started, the viewer know little to nothing about who Costner and Duvall are shooting to kill.  Therefore, you really have no emotion attached to the off-ing of a bad guy.  In other words, when a bad guy was blown away, you were left asking, &quot;Who's that?&quot; or &quot;What's the significance of that guy?&quot;  If you knew who these guys were, you'd probably give a darn when they'd expire.  But you don't.  It's just another guy who got blown half-way across the street by the &quot;splatter gun&quot;.<p>Oh don't get me wrong, the final shoot-out was probably one of the best both visually and sounding Western shoot-outs ever portrayed on film, but like I said, you just didn't know who anybody was.  I enjoyed it thoroughly, but had the director, I'm assuming Costner, spent more time telling who the bad guys were, the movie would have probably been one of the best westerns of all time.</p></body></html>

Vampires and Lycans (werewolves) have been at war for untold centuries.  Very few even remember how the blood feud started.  But the crossing of a Vamp with a Lycan has always been forbidden.  Or has it?<br /><br />UNDERWORLD is action-packed from the get go; you jump right in and it never lets up.  Epic battles, high-speed chases, gun fights, impossible stunts, blood and gore (although less than you would think), and fantastic transformations keep you on the edge of your seat.  The directing/cinematography/editing are excellent, cutting away from anything truly disgusting before you really see it; leaving the rest to your vivid imagination.  The acting is impressive, with Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, and Michael Sheen all giving scene-stealing performances.  The rest of the cast, including Bill Nighy, are equally good in there respective roles.  And let me just say, the costuming for UNDERWORLD is marvelous:  gorgeous dresses, fabulous leathers, skin-tight cat suits.  I'd like to go shopping were the Vamps do!<br /><br />UNDERWORLD includes all the universal Vampire and Werewolf lore - sunlight kills Vamps, silver kills Lycans, you become a Vampire or a Werewolf from a bite.  Not too many surprises in this area (although these precepts are taken to new heights), making it easier to keep up with the plot.  But added to the standard lore is the theory that there is a line of humans who carry a gene that enables them to survive a bite from BOTH a Vampire and a Lycanthrope.  And this is what the Lycans are looking for.<br /><br />Even if you aren't a fan of monster flicks, you will enjoy UNDERWORLD.  It makes for a great popcorn evening at home.  It is clearly too intense for the youngest members of the family, but tweens and up should be just fine.<br /><br />So, what DO you get, when you cross a Vampire with a Lycanthrope?  Apparently, something the Lycans want and the Vampires don't.  And something bigger and badder than both...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A top notch action thriller"></head><body><p>In "The Bourne Identity," audience favorite Matt Damon gets his hands dirty in an role that allows him retain all of his nice guy attitude but also kick tail with the best of secret agents ever portrayed on film.<br />Already having been made into a 1988 TV miniseries, this movie takes some liberies with the cold war plot of the original Ludlum novel but, its still one excellent thriller.<br />A man (Damon) is found floating more dead than alive in the sea by an Italian fishing crew. The captain, who knows a thing or two about surgery, tends to the man's wounds and removes two bullets and a microchip from his back.<br />After he recovers, the man realizes he has amnesia, with no clue to his identity other than a Swiss bank account found in the chip.<br />With no other leads to follow, the man travels to Switzerland and learns that the account is for a safety deposit box. The box contains an exorbitant amount of money, a gun and several passports and identities, one of which is Jason Borne.<br />Deciding to assume the Borne identity, the man barely has time to ponder his next move before a military squad and policemen ambush him.<br />As perfectly cast as Damon is for this role, the real star of the film is director Doug Liman, who hits all the right notes in setting up the drama and delivering with "pulse-pounding high-octane action scenes." Now if that isn't on the next run of commercials I don't know what is.<br />When Bourne begins his escape from his pursuers via a fire escape, Liman doesn't just settle on the quick hop down. Bourne has to scale down the building and Liman pans the camera at just the right angles to show that this isn't something you'd want to try at home...that is, assuming if you lived in a 12-story high-rise.<br />Since no espionage thriller is complete without a romance no matter how trite it may be, Bourne has to meet some unattached female in some manner.<br />While on the run, he meets Marie Krutz (Franka Potente), coincidentally enough, an unattached female in need of some cash. Well, cash Bourne has and he offers Marie $10,000 for a ride to Paris. Guess he doesn't trust the Metro either?<br />Thankfully Marie is not portrayed as the cliched tagalong sidekick and actually significantly helps Bourne in his search for his true identity.<br />Bourne maps out this exhaustive plan for securing some information from a hotel only to have Marie get it by flirting with the hotel attendant.<br />It turns out that Bourne's pursuers are none other than the CIA, or rather a CIA division spearheaded by Ted Conklin (Chris Cooper), who wants Bourne dead while keeping his supervisor (Brian Cox) in the dark as to the real reason he wants Bourne out of action.<br />Rather than prolong the mission any longer than necessary, Cooper sends three assassins to terminate Bourne and tie up the loose ends of the last mission Bourne was sent out to accomplish.<br />Liman introduces the assassins perfectly, having each of them speak as little as possible, and only putting them on camera enough to remind the audience that they are a prevalent threat ... right until Bourne encounters them, at which point they become as threatening as Freddie Prinze Jr.<br />Not that Bourne has it easy escaping the local authorities either. In one of the film's best moments, he and Marie race through the streets of Paris in a mind blowing car chase the likes of which haven't been seen on the big screen in quite some time. Meaning it's done in a manner that won't require audiences to suspend their disbelief to enjoy it.<br />The film's conclusion is a bit unsatisfying but makes sense given the way the story plays out.<br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

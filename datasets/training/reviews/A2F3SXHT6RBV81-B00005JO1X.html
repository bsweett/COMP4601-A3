<meta name="summary" content="Lucy Finds Her Wonderland In a Wardrobe."></head><body><p>The star of this parable about good winning out over evil was William Moseley who played Peter (he must have been cast because of his resemblance to Prince William).  Edmund had a starring role as the betrayer of his siblings to the non-human witch, thinking he would get some affection.  The movie itself, based on the Narnia book by C. S. Lewis, was supposedly about four English children who were sent to Coombe Halt from wartime London to a place of safety with an elusive professor and his stern housekeeper who enforces house rules.  However, she was a pussycat compared with the mean witch they have to fight for their lives in the "magic kingdom" of Nardia.<br /><br />Susan, Lucy, Peter and Edmund descend on a scholarly environment (Lewis' actual high-church Anglican school as an Oxford don), which they found boring and restrictive.  To pass the time, instead of reading, they play 'hide and seek,' managing to disturb the professor who told them to act like a family.  Children from selected schools here who finished reading this first volume and wrote about their impressions as an assignment were rewarded with a special screening of the movie.  They attended Regal theaters the day before the public was able to see it.  I'd been planning for it several months but got to the Carmike-owned theater too late for the first showing as it was "sold out."  It was reported that these "low readers" now want to read the other six books about Narnia, based on Christian tenets but are full of demons from hell and a pagan ritual of sacrifice.<br /><br />It looked like a Winter Wonderland as they tramped in the snow in the place Lucy discovered after she "hid" in a wardrobe full of coats.  She formed a lasting attachment to Thomas, the faun.  Edmund had visions of grandeur.  When the ice melted, we saw strange creatures at the fair with green, green grass and beautiful mountains.  Peter rode the mythical unicorn as he led the war against the witch.  It was a fierce battle of medieval warfare with a firebird.  The winged creatures with huge rocks saved the day.  The cast was full of talking beasts and magical creatures signifying Christian symbolism.<br /><br />The chief of police was a wolf, but got outfoxed by a red fox and a couple of talking beavers.  I didn't care much for the witch played by Tilda Swinton; the dresses wore her instead of vice versa.  She told Edmund about the prophecy which had to be stopped from coming true.  She looked like an English Gweneth Paltrow in her overlarge garments.  A defeated woman never gives up -- she fights to the end.<br /><br />After they are crowned by King Alslam (who was dead but arose from the dead), Lucy the Valiant (crowned by Thomas), Edmund the Just, Susie the Gentle, and King Peter the Magnificient rode through some beautiful woods on horseback and find their way back through the closet.  Though they were adults before leaving Narnia, they return still children.  There are two new  biographies about the author, THE NARNIAN, by Alan Jacobs and JACK'S LIFE by Doug Gresham who was a producer of this movie.  His mother Joy married Jack Lewis in later life.  It was reported in 'Time' magazine that 95 million of these books have been sold since Lewis' death in 1963.<br /><br />It was not an enjoyable movie, but it was somewhat different from others of its genre.  It was a little overdone with the war violence and hype of half-human creatures from the underworld to show the theological issues of Lewis' day; his fantasy series for children were the bestsellers then and again today, thanks to this production.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Helen Mirren finally gets her Oscar!!!"></head><body><p>She finally got her Oscar,well done Helen Mirren,Her peformance in the Queen is worthy of buying this alone,this is one of the recent films I actually went to a theater to go see,I pretty much knew she was gonna get the little gold statue wa before Oscar time!!! The Queen is a great film, along with Mirren's incredible preformance I think that Michael Sheen and James Cromwell(who doe a great British accent by the way,considering he's American!) did a great job as well!!! I'm glad this DVD is in my collection,and I will probably purchase the Blu Ray in the future!!! Recommended!!! A+</p></body></html>

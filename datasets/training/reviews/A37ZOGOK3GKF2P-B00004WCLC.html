<meta name="summary" content="Tom Cruise Was Robbed, I'm Feelin' a little Froggy"></head><body><p>Possibly the best character movie since "Short Cuts," this film is more off the wall and a whole lot of strange.  The multi stories are all interesting.  My favorite ivolves Tom Cruise.  He was robbed from his oscar.  His performance was so antistereotype of his persona and was so brilliantly acted.  His scenes were breathtaking at times.  John C. Reilly also did a superior job, but these men aren't alone.  All the cast was super and you care about the characters.  At the end of the movie you really get to know them and feel almost that you might have made a friend or two.  Look out for the raining frogs.  That part was simply great.  One of the best movies that was not nominated for best picture.</p></body></html>

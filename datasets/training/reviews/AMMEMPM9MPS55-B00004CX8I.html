<meta name="summary" content="A Christian Perspective"></head><body><p>I read an article the other day by an evangelical theologian in which he lambasted Harry Potter, suggesting as one of his chief criticisms that Potter was a 'morally ambiguous' character and therefore unsuitable. What amazed me is that he seemed ignorant of the fact that every story thrives on those sorts of ambiguities, not least the story of the Bible which, I suggest, offers very few characters who could serve as role models without qualification. Might I mention Moses, Esther and David as just three 'morally ambigious' characters (and heroes, at that) of the Old Testament. I mention this because I can imagine (and I think I recall actually hearing) 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' being rejected by a Christian critic on precisely those grounds.<p>Randle P. McMurphy is rebellious, licentious and from a Christian perspective, immoral. He is a violent criminal, a rapist, and yet he emerges as the hero out of this tale of a man's struggle against the establishment. McMurphy finds himself fighting against an institution which imprisons its members within a regime designed only to make them conform and serve the interests of the institution, though ostensibly for the wellbeing of the members; a regime kept alive by depriving the members of the truth about who they are; a regime in which dependency and conformity are maintained through deception and indoctrination.<p>It was in the day when Erving Goffmann published his famous sociological study, 'Asylums,' that 'Cuckoo's Nest' had its genesis, though the film's comment goes beyond criticising merely mental institutions and their inhumane treatment of human beings. It is a vigorously anti-establishment film which rails against injustice and oppression by showing us a man's attempt to escape conformity, however ambiguous some of his actions might be when viewed in a moral light. But so compelling is the portrayal of life in a mental institution that one can scarcely ignore the warnings the film has for society. People - in fact, Christians - need to pay attention.<p>I suspect that Christian critics who have found rape, violence and attempted murder (rightly) distasteful and rejected this film on that basis, have shot themselves in the foot. For whilst there is uproar about McMurphy's failings and the wrongness of his rebellious ways, a very revealing fact emerges. Why no uproar over the equally morally ambigious (and objectionable) character of Nurse Ratched? Why do the same critics not rally against her failings and the wrongness of her manipulative and malicious schemes which, ultimately, have far more disastrous consequences than McMurphy's actions (namely, Billy's death and McMurphy's labotomy)? The answer is that she belongs to the system, that she is middle-class, respectable, that she has authority, and therefore it scarcely occurs that we ought to be questioning her moral culpability or otherwise. Therein lies the revealing fact: that the evangelical critic has his agenda shaped far more by the system of this world - dare I say it, by the middle classes, even - than by honest, unbiased reflection.<p>So I do not say that the moral tone of the film is pleasant. But I do suggest that in the end Nurse Ratched comes out by far the more guilty of the two main protaganists, and this ought to prompt the Christian critic to ask what the film might have to say about the way society is ordered - even if it makes him a little uncomfortable about some of his less defensible presuppositions.</p></body></html>

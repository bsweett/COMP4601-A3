Throw in Bruce Campbell as the lead, and the Whackymeter goes off the charts.<br /><br />Bubba Ho-Tep is the tale of loves lost and destinies denied. The movie opens with Elvis (Campbell) in a rest home in East Texas, having long since switched his identity with an Elvis impersonator named Sebastian (also Campbell). A broken hip lands the Real Elvis in a retirement home. And of course, he has no proof that he is truly the real Elvis because all the papers blew up in a "barbeque accident."<br /><br />Elvis' one companion is JFK. Yes, that John F. Kennedy. Except that he's a black man played by Ossie Davis. And the government altered his body (from white to black) to conceal his identity. And there's sand filling the hole in his head from the assassination attempt.<br /><br />Think that's weird? We haven't even gotten to the plot yet.<br /><br />Stalking the retirement home is a soul-sucking mummy. The mummy was kidnapped from a local exhibit but then crashed into a nearby river. It now stalks the living, absorbing their "ka" (or was it "ba"?) through any orifice available. And when you think about it, wouldn't a retirement home be the perfect feasting ground for a creature that feeds on people? After all, nobody notices - or, director Don Coscarelli (of Phantasm fame) hints, actually cares - when the elderly die. If they happen to die a little earlier, so what?<br /><br />The real terror is that the victims' souls are digested and ultimately destroyed. No afterlife for them. Nothing.<br /><br />This mummy, for reasons that aren't quite fully explained, dresses in cowboy boots and a broad-brimmed hat when he stalks his prey. He is, in essence, a "bubba." Thus, Bubba Ho-Tep.<br /><br />There's a lot of symbolism and parallels in this movie that make it alternately thoughtful and sad. Elvis, a symbol of male virility, now has a "cancerous growth" in a very personal place that he believes will eventually kill him. JFK, a symbol of government stability, is cast as a paranoid delusional old black man. And the mummy, an ancient being that no one remembers but is valuable enough to steal from a museum, is just trying to survive.<br /><br />This movie is a lot less Evil Dead and a lot more Cocoon. We see what happens to the elderly in disturbingly accurate detail: Elvis' roommate, Bull Thomas (Harrisong Young) dies a long, slow death. His delicious but estranged daughter Callie (Heidi Marnhout) collects Bull's things, only to toss them away...including Bull's Purple Heart medal. Callie, with her short skirt and high heels, comes to represent the youth obsessed culture that has neither the time nor inclination to care for the old and infirm.<br /><br />Coscarelli shows us Elvis' slow death through his own eyes. Time speeds up as nurses zip in and out of his room. It is all so meaningless and drab, such that it's only a matter of time before Elvis dies, alone and estranged from his own daughter. Just like Bull. It's a credit to the film that Bull is never forgotten.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are a lot of homages to Elvis and Evil Dead. As my wife pointed out, there are some obvious parallels to what Ash experiences in Evil Dead, including a scene where Elvis chants a spell to stop the mummy. There are plenty of references to Elvis' knowledge of martial arts, his experiences in television, and the bad choices he made in his past. Elvis fans will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Okay, maybe they will be a little disappointed that their beloved icon is hobbling around in a retirement home with a possible STD fighting a mummy.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell does a great job as Elvis beneath makeup and fat suits. Ossie Davis plays JFK straight, an amazing feat unto itself in a movie whose plot revolves around a mummy run amok. Everyone else is suitably one-dimensional.<br /><br />Alone and with only one friend, Elvis finally decides to make a stand. He watches another icon, the Lone Ranger (a guy they call Kemosabe, played by Larry Pennell) fight the mummy off and die as a result. He died, but his soul was intact.<br /><br />In some sense, the mummy is the second chance for two mythological characters to take their place in history. Although the Lone Ranger was fiction, JFK and Elvis were not. However, they have become so revered and characterized that they are legends unto themselves - easily on par with the Lone Ranger. The problem is, neither JFK or Elvis were ever really that heroic. They were real people, with real flaws. With the arrival of the mummy, they have the chance to earn their heroic status and die how we would want all heroes to die - fighting evil, not rotting away in a retirement home.<br /><br />Bubba Ho-Tep also has some genuinely scary moments. The mummy first manifests as a big, nasty scarab, killing a vicious old lady who steals the glasses right off of a woman in an iron lung. Then Elvis takes on the scarab mano-a-mano, and we are once again reminded of Campbell as Ash.<br /><br />Bubba Ho-Tep is a slow, plodding movie. The music, the casting, and the direction is all spot on, but it is not really an action movie, a comedy, or a drama. Ultimately, Bubba Ho-Tep is a horror movie, but not in the traditional sense.<br /><br />Bubba Ho-Tep is about growing old, being forgotten, and not mattering enough for people to care about you anymore. And that's horror enough.</p></body></html>

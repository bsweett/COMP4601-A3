<meta name="summary" content="Still One Of The Best Movies Of It's Kind."></head><body><p>In 1989, Tim Burton and Warner Bros. brought Batman to the bigscreen, giving both Batman and Bruce Wayne a severe overhaul and finally giving him a movie that truly captures the purity of the character. Gone were any and all elements of the corny Adam West show of the 1960's. Here, a new and improved, darker and more complex Batman emerged. Personally, I love this movie. Always have, since I was [...] and was frightened by my first home-viewing of the movie. Opinions seem to go in every direction about this movie, but one thing that cannot be denied is that this incarnation of Batman was way ahead of it's time.<br /><br />To play Batman/Bruce Wayne, an unlikely candidate in Michael Keaton was elected. Delivering a somewhat neurotic and mysterious version of the Dark Knight, Keaton was complimented well by his nemesis in the Joker, as played by Jack Nicholson. Some may say Nicholson went over the top with his performance, but that's the way it should be. Balls to the wall is how Nicholson plays the Joker, and I wouldn't want it any other way. Nicholson delivers pure evil with a grin, and nearly steals the show from the Caped Crusader. These two performances alone just about make the movie what it is, and behind the direction of Tim Burton, create a movie that is really intelligent, moody and layered, but still has the accessible, popcorn movie feel that one should expect from any superhero flick. "Batman" delivers the goods, with just as much action as there is character development. The story itself may be a bit dodgy, but does a good job of telling the origins of Batman in a quick, and to-the-point manner, which helps push along the pace.<br /><br />Some may say that time hasn't been too kind to this film, and I'm likely to agree. Afterall, it was made in 1989, and with a soundtrack heavy on the Prince tunes, it's not hard to feel trapped in the 80's. So parts of it may be corny and truly dated, but it's still one of the best superhero movies to date. It set the standard for many movies to come, and for better or for worse, paved the way for many other Bat flicks and pushed Batman's relevancy to the point where now, he is just about the most recognizable superhero the world over. "Batman" is simply revolutionary, inspiring and way ahead of the curve. Worth watching over and over again.</p></body></html>

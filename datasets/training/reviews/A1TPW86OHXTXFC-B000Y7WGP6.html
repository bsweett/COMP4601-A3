That makes sense, since that seems to sum up the current, modern political situation we're mired in. Berg takes us straight into the heart of the Middle East problem and though the good guys may win the smaller battles in his movie the film builds so much complication around them that it's clear there's no real victory here or anywhere. Like all movies about the Middle East, The Kingdom is ultimately hopeless." Josh Tyler<br /><br />Peter Berg has directed a film of the Middle East that resonates with me. The film opens with a violent attack on Americans living and working in Saudi Arabia. It is so graphic and violent that it is understood immediately that we are in a place that will not let-up. Ever vigilant and ever ready we must never let our guard down. After the attack we follow the FBI and a team of 4 agents who go to Saudi Arabia to follow the clues and find the murderers of one hundred innocents and one of their own. Jamie Fox plays Agent Fleury with finesse.  Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman round out the team.<br /><br />The essence of the film surrounds the friendship that Agent Fleury and Col. Al-Ghazi, played by Ashraf Barhom, develop. Men from two cultures but with one goal in mind-the murderers, find and destroy them. This is a lasting friendship and Ashraf Barhom steals this film. If the goal of this film was to identify with the Saudis the goal has been met.  The hunt becomes so reality based and intense, that I was on the edge of my seat with my hands over my eyes for many scenes. I was holding my breath as I realized that I felt as if I had been there and that this is the daily life of the peoples in the Middle East.<br /><br />The film's theme that there is more that unites us with the Middle East culture than divides us hits home time and time again and the final scene resonates with those thoughts.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 01-27-08<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNEW">Friday Night Lights (Widescreen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006OD44E">Ray</a></p></body></html>

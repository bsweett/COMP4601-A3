If you like Will Ferrell spoofs you'll like this one.<br /><br />This movie may be blasphemous to diehard NASCAR fans but was a non stop joyride for me. The fun is all in watching these characters play into the roles of redneck racers. Although the movie pressed a slight message of teamwork the true fun came from watching Will Ferrell interact with Sacha Baron Cohen. I can see these actors coming together on many comedies in the near future. With all the sex driven and action packed lackluster movies out now it's good to have a few good comedies to stir the pot.<br /><br />Recommended for non-fans of NASCAR and fans of Will Ferrell<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2008</p></body></html>

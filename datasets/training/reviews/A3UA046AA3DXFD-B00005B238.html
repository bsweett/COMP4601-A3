<meta name="summary" content="There's only one man who can take on Predator: The Governator"></head><body><p>We, Sid the Elf, wanted a real nice B to kick the weekend off perfectly, so we picked up Predator. Well, Sid was stunned. Predator was a perfectly done action flick. Don't take us wrong, anytime Arnold is teamed with Jesse the body Ventura, Apollo Creed, and the immortal Chink Webber from Lockup the B will be flowing like wine. There was an ample ammount of explosions, totally awsome guns, and the toughest lines around.(We're not even going to mention anymore that anytime Arnold talks the possibility for hillarity is there) With that said, Predator was the perfect guy movie, the only thing that was missing was smokin hot chicks. But, we found ourselves saying no less than 10 times during the screening, "This movie is killer!" or something comperable.<br /><br />Arnold plays Dutch, a CIA operative who has the rep of being the baddest of the bad. Dutch and his team, all of whom are extremely close to one another, are sent into the jungles of Central America to find a missing group of soldiers. The guy responsible for bringing them in? That's right, Appolo Creed. Or, Dillon! Him and Arnold go way back, and appear to be tight as we see in the famous "Whasa matta? FBI's made you gone soft?" scene. When they get to the jungle, things are definately strange. Dillon and Arnold's team are not gelling, and there is a strange presence in the air. That would be Predator, who is responsible for the missing soldiers. Sid is going to go out on a limb and say Predator might be the coolest villan in action movie history. He is a man-eating robot alien with an almost inperceptable cloaking device. Almost. Arnold and the team, with the help of the sweetest gun in action movie history, figure out how to track Predator. But, before they can do any damage to him, the Predator picks off everyone but Arnold, including the legendary Chink Webber. It got dusty in the North Pole when Predator finally got Chink. You knew the whole time that it was going to come down to Arnold vs. Predator. Arnold figures out a way to protect himself from Predator's tracking capabilities, levels the playing field, and takes him on. Sid won't spoil the ending, but it's awesome.<br /><br />So, Sid would have to say, if you're looking for a B action to laugh at stay away from Predator. However, if you want to get totally pumped and watch an all-time killer action flick, Predator is your Vehicle baby. And if you haven't seen Predator yet, Sid doesn't know what to tell you. Actually, yeah he does. Get a copy ASAP.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Wonderfully Realistic Depiction Of Combat!"></head><body><p>This film represents a wonderful example of how well Hollywood can sometimes transform the truths and spirit of a book into a moving and inspiring experience. It is a terrific period piece in the sense that it captures the essence of a now long-gone spirit of concern and empathy that older and compassionate senior officers had for their soldiers. Mel Gibson seems to be aging very well as evidenced by his wonderful characterization of Lt. Col. Harold Moore, a career Army officer who lives both fully and well, but who is at the same time also totally devoted and committed to meet the responsibility he's entrusted with in terms of the welfare of his officers and men. <p>The movie, based on the historical fact of the first large scale engagement by American soldiers with the regular North Vietnamese Army (NVA), as opposed to the clashes with the guerilla-style Viet Cong later on, traces the extensive training and preparation of the regiment in the experimental use of helicopters to transport soldiers rapidly into enemy-held areas. The risks associated with this new style of tactical warfare quickly becomes apparent; eight to ten serial efforts are required to fully mobilize the unit, and the men first dropped find themselves dangerously exposed in the event a vastly superior enemy force engages. Of course, this is exactly what happens, and the brutal exchange that then ensues is the backdrop for the movie.<p>Over a period of some five days, the encircled American forces lose almost half their personnel, yet are able to kill more than 1,800 of the attacking Vietnamese soldiers. Seen in the cold light of day, this exchange becomes a de-facto documentary on the inherent risks of combat, and the quicksilver nature of modern warfare. The cast helps here, for veterans like Sam Elliot (as the Sgt. Rock-like Sergeant Major) and Barry Pepper (as the UPI reporter who forges a life-long friendship with Wallace and helps to write the book) add to the sense of gritty reality the film captures so well. Madeline Stowe is also very good as the enduring wife of the Colonel who also acts to lead the women of the organization in the men's absence. Like another recent movie, "Black Hawk Down", this film helps to de-mystify modern warfare without glorifying or judging it. This is a wonderful film, and one I heartily recommend. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

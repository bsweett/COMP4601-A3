The brutality of war as seen through the eyes of a child, and that child's escape to her labyrinth world (which is, in some ways, almost as brutal) is the center of the film, and no one is spared. Brilliantly photographed and designed, Ofelia's fantasy world seems to be her only escape. Of course, things are deeper and more complicated than that, but I won't blab anything away.As Ofelia, young Ivana Baquero makes an auspicious film debut. Her understanding of the material is so natural; Sergi Lopez is a nasty villain, who really believes that his mindless, evil behavior is his only recourse. Most of all, Maribel Verdu, as Mercedes, the housekeeper, is absolutely brilliant. At just under 2 hours, there is never a slow moment, and the subtitles are rarely a distraction; the story-line flows as easily as a babbling brook. This is certainly an original take on the fantasy films that have inundated the screens of late, but few are as compelling and thought-provokng. Though a little too violent and gory for kids, this is highly recommended for all discerning film-goers. Bravo, Senor del Toro!  UPDATE: The 2-disc DVD is outstanding; loaded with smart extras, and a pristine widescreen print of the film.</p></body></html>

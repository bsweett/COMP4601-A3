<meta name="summary" content="What a downer!"></head><body><p>This is the story of a troubled daughter of a troubled father . . the father was unable to do much of anything since developing the theories he was known for as a young man.<br /><br />His daughter was haunted by the thought that she might turn out like her father, who turned insane many years before he died.  His death opens up the story.  And then there is an older sister, anal retentive, controlling in the extreme, who is trying to control her younger sister's life, and perhaps have her committed to an institution, based on her belief that she is turning out to be insane like their father.<br /><br />The problem is, it is very difficult to develop empathy for any of the characters.  The younger daughter spent her time frowning and secretive, and mostly uncommunicative.  The older daughter was detached from everything.  The young man, a Doctoral student who admired the father, stayed at the fringes of the story throughout most of the film.<br /><br />Was there a point, or point of view, or anything else that the film was trying to get across.  If so, I don't think it did a good job.  I would not recommend it, neither for the story, nor for the acting, which was, in the main, stilted and forced.</p></body></html>

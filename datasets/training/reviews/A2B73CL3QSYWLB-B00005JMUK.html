Her performance is not all make-up, prosthetics and weight gain.  Theron gets inside the skin of this used and abused and ultimately evil individual.  Christina Ricci matches her as her naive lover and unwitting accomplice.  Also, any film that features Bruce Dern, albeit in a smallish role, is aces in my book.  As tawdry as the tale here is, it is not done in an exploitative manner.  That said, this is not the type of film I care to re-visit very often.  It's a compelling yet not very pleasurable experience.  If you have to see one serial killer movie, then this is probably the one to see.</p></body></html>

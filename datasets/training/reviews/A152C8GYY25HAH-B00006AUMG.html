<meta name="summary" content="Excellent example of style over substance"></head><body><p>Thanks in large part to director Guillermo del Toro, "Blade 2" is a whiz-bang sequel. [The original was directed by Stephen Norrington.] It may be just a testosterone-laden movie aimed squarely at young males, but at least it's finely crafted and not without a touch of style. As for substance, forget substance. It's based on a comic book and, if the characters all behave in a cartoonish way, perhaps that's on purpose. <p>As for the special effects, "Blade 2" has some creatures that are genuinely scary. When these mutant vampires take a bit out of you, they don't kid around. <p>The script is absurd and full of plot holes. Blade [Wesley Snipes], half man, half vampire, now faces a new enemy - a new kind of vampire that is unaffected by most of the conventional weapons used against such creatures, Even the purebred members of Vampire Nation enlists his aid because these monsters are out to get them, too. The script, though, is just a framework on which is built a series of dazzling, adrenaline-pumping fight sequences, all fought on fairly ingenious and properly creepy sets. <p>"Blade 2" is strictly for the boys. It's a bad choice for a date movie. Frankly, it's not really my kind of movie. I'm more intrigued by character-driven fare. Still, it's only fair to admit that, for what it is, this is very good entry in the horror genre.</p></body></html>

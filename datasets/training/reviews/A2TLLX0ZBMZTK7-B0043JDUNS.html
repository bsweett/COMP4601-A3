For one, the villain didn't feel fleshed out enough, felt kinda flat honestly. I also don't like how they changed actors for the role of Rhodey (think I spelled it right?), I hate when they change up actors like that. I didn't care for the story as much as the first one. I do like how they gave Black Widow a role, though, she was pretty great. I also like how it kinda shows a Thor-like cameo-thing at the end. It's a decent movie with some strong points, but not as good as the first one. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></body></html>

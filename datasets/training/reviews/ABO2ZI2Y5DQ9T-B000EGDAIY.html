<meta name="summary" content="Creepy Bits Are Better Than The Whole"></head><body><p>If you ask whether or not 'The Grudge' is really creepy, yes, it is, but I think horror film fans would find the film as a whole is trying to be too clever.  It features American actors but is set in Japan (directed by Japanese Takashi Shimizu), and moreover throws away the usual chronological order to tell the story, very unusual storytelling method in horror films.<br /><br />With this non-linear approach, the film can be ambitious.  So what you see in the first scene is the most shocking.  You see Bill Pullman staring at the city of Tokyo, from the window of an apartment.  Then, wow, a big surprise comes.<br /><br />Sara Michelle Geller is nominal star of the film, but the real feature is actually the evil power that must be dwelling in the apparently ordinaly small, Japanese-style house in Tokyo.  It is soon revealed that in that place some terrible incidents happen to the visitors, including Ms. Geller's character Karen, American exchange student, or other people (mostly Americans, including Clea Duvall or Jason Behr as Geller's boyfriend).<br /><br />[SURELY CREEPY] The film is surely creepy, and the film comes with the carefully controled sound effects (as in 'The Ringu' or 'Ju-On' the latter being the original version of this film).  The atmosphere of Tokyo is captured very well, and the 'lost' sense of American visitors in this city is presented convincingly.  (Incidentally, you can see the same downtown street of Shinjuku, as was seen in 'Lost in Translation'.)<br /><br />But horror fans would soon realize that director Shimizu uses some conventional scares -- like sudden big noises -- and the film often looks as if too eager to be scary.  In the latter half, the film begins to show its defects -- it is repetitious.  People are killed, or intimidated, by Toshio and Kayako (evil spirits played by the same actors as Japanese versions), but ... it is as if we see too much of them, maybe more than Ms. Geller herself.<br /><br />[IN A NUTSHELL] the problem is this.  In the beginning of the film, you see THE GRUDGE IS THE CURSE OF THE ONE WHO DIES IN THE GRIP OF POWERFUL RAGE. and that curse is, it says PASSED, LIKE A VIRUS, FROM VICTIM TO VICTIM IN AN ENDLESS, GROWING CHAIN OF HORROR.  Yes, it looks endless, in a bad way.<br /><br />Perhaps the film's history is more interesting than the Hollywood remake itself.  The original 'Ju-on' and its sequel (shot at the same time) were made-for-video short films.  Then, two theatrical films were made, AND this Hollywood remake.  The franchize spread like a virus.  And they are planning to make another one.  It's time to stop that, isn't it?</p></body></html>

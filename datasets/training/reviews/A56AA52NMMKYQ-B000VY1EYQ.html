<meta name="summary" content="Tasty, winsome tale!!"></head><body><p>Kerrie Russell is lovely in the title role of this story of a hard working waitress trapped in a dead-end job with a loser husband.  She is also a pie-baking and pie-inventing wizard.<br /><br />When she discovers she is pregnant, she sees the baby as foreclosing her options of escaping a miserable marriage.  An affair with a hunky OB/GYN doctor and friendship with the diner's elderly owner (Andy Griffith) open her eyes to life's new possibilities.<br /><br />The movie works better if you suspend disbelief for an hour or so.  The pies look scrumptious!!!</p></body></html>

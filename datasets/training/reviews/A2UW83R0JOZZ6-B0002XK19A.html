<meta name="summary" content="Stunning Sequel"></head><body><p>There are many films whose storylines have encouraged sequels - many fail to be as good as the original, an audience's expectations raised due to the freshness of characters and plotlines.  There are only two that come to my mind that surpass their predecessors: "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" and "The Godfather: Part II".  I can now add an easy third to my list, and "Spider-Man 2" is, without a doubt, that third movie.<p>The story continues with Peter Parker (so superlatively played by the boyish, nerdy Maguire) struggling through college, his grades rapidly declining because of the countless hours spent swinging about the city saving lives.  His one true love Mary Jane (Dunst) is now a Broadway actress and model, her face plastered on billboards and posters everywhere.  Aunt May has fallen on hard times, the bank threatening to foreclose on her home and Harry Osborn (Franco), now the proprietor of Oscorp, is still bent on revenge against Spider-Man for the death of his father Norman (the Green Goblin of 2002's "Spider-Man", played by Willem Dafoe).  <p>Time to throw a superb supervillain into the mix.<p>Enter Dr. Otto Octavius (Molina), another scientist earning Peter's utmost esteem with a breakthrough experiment that will change the face of nuclear physics for years to come.  During a presentation of his latest invention that would make Oscorp a multi-million dollar enterprise again, the exposition goes horribly awry and "Doc Ock" is left with four mechanical tentacles bolted into his spinal column, each solid steel "arm" independently functional...and menacing.<p>Torn between the sacrificial life of a superhero and the normal life he truly wants, Pete decides to throw in the towel, surrendering his Spider suit to the trash and coming clean to Mary Jane about his feelings for her.<p>Or does he?<p>With Doc Ock up to no good and Harry's growing animosity for the masked crusader, Peter has his work cut out for him and there is no simple evasion of his civic duty.<p>So many aspects of this film aid in the surmounting of the original, primarily the overwhelming amount of CGI that was handsomely paid for ($54 million alone was spent on digital effects) on a $200 million budget.  What will really take your breath away are the two fight sequences between Doc Ock and Spidey, a melee atop a clock tower and a confrontation aboard a speeding "el" train gasp-inducing.  You'll become so engrossed by the intense physical combat onscreen that you'll forget that the two men you see fighting are not really men at all - they're computer-generated images (for the most part).  We even get an illustrated recap of the first film during the opening credits with original artwork by Alex Ross ("Kingdom Come").  Fanboys will be especially proud of director Sam Raimi's homage to the comic, the shot of Peter depositing the Spidey suit into an alley dumpster taken directly from a panel in Issue #50 entitled "Spider-Man No More".<p>Raimi was so eager to get started on the sequel that he signed on to direct more than a month before the first film was even released and shooting began before the final draft of the script was completed.  Alvin Sargent, along with Michael Chabon, Alfred Gough and Miles Millar penned the screenplay with the guidance of Spider-Man creators Stan Lee (who has a cameo) and Steve Ditko and took the story out into left field.  Whereas "Spider-Man" relied on character establishment and a little schmaltz to win over its audience, "Spider-Man 2" gets dipped in a vat of serious drama, allowing every actor to really show their wares.  <p>Maguire is excellent - Raimi knew what he was doing when he cast the then 26-year-old after seeing his portrayal of Homer Wells in 1999's "The Cider House Rules".  His participation in the sequel became hesitant when he was injured during a stunt in "Seabiscuit" and suffered severe back pains for several months.  A second injury (a broken arm) further delayed shooting, but Maguire rode the storm and kept Jake Gyllenhaal (the actor in mind to replace him, not to mention Dunst's current squeeze) from taking the role that was rightfully his.<p>Raimi made another wise casting decision with British thespian Alfred Molina, a chameleon of an actor who first got recognition as Indiana Jones' greedy jungle guide Satipo ("You throw me the idol, I throw you the whip!") in "Raiders of the Lost Ark"; after the titillating scene where he is covered head-to-toe with tarantulas, Molina is certainly familiar with arachnids and the atmosphere of the "Spider-Man" set suit him well.  He eats the lens as Doc Ock, playing the character with a combination of zeal and earnestness.  After Willem Dafoe's over-the-top theatrics as the Green Goblin, Molina is a breath of fresh air and gives Doc Ock something very important - integrity.  Other actors who were considered for the role included Sam Neill (eh...), Robert DeNiro (`scuse me?), Ed Harris (no thanks) and Chris Cooper (sorry, I just keep thinking Col. Frank Fitts, US Marine Corps).  Aren't you glad Molina made the cut?<p>Dunst, still equipped with her B-movie scream, also gets a chance to put her talents to the test and makes Mary Jane a stronger, more independent woman with much less of a "damsel-in-distress" approach than the previous film.  James Franco is excellent this second time around as Harry Osborn, his bitterness towards Spider-Man spectacularly rendered through his dark, frigid glowering.  Rosemary Harris, a mere appendage in the first, gets to shine considerably as Aunt May, the Oscar-winning actress's dramatic prowess manifested in her scenes with Maguire.  J.K. Simmons is still a ball of fire as J. Jonah Jameson, senior editor of the Daily Bugle, with his perpetual anti-hero sentiments of Spider-Man and Elizabeth Banks (Betty Brant) and Bill Nunn (Robbie Robertson) reprise their roles with pride.<p>The film ends once again on a climactic note, setting the stage for a spectacular sequel and you'll have a pretty good idea which villain will make an appearance.  Sony Pictures greenlighted a third installment back in March of this year - the movie is slated for a 2007 release, but may even be pushed to 2006 if production goes well.  Let us hope so, because if "Spider-Man 2" is a promise of an even greater film to come, we're all in for a real treat!</p></body></html>

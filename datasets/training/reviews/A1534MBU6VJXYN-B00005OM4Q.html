<meta name="summary" content="My Favorite Movie"></head><body><p>Cameron Crowe has without a doubt made many great films (though his recent work has been lacking), but it's no contest which of his films is his masterpiece: "Almost Famous". Funny, inspiring, and at times heartwarming, and backed by one of the best soundtracks ever, "Almost Famous" is a cinematic masterpiece that I would place right up there along with "Goodfellas" and "The Godfather". IT IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE.<br /><br />The film (based on Crowe's younger day) takes place in 1973. William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is a 15 year old amateur rock journalist for Cream Magazine. Mentored by world renowned rock writer Lester Bangs (a perfectly snide Philip Seymour Hoffman), he is given by the biggest assignment of his life. He is hired by Rolling Stone to pen an article of the up and coming rock band Stillwater. He is sent out on tour with them, much to the dismay of his overprotective mother (the always wonderful Francis McDormand). He becomes close with the band, but mostly with the band's disillusioned and drug addicted guitarist, Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup). He also meets the woman who will change his life: "band aid" Penny Lane (Kate Hudson, who steals the show). Over the course of the tour, William does a lot of growing up, and learns of the harsh realities of the music industry. By the time the tour is over, he is no longer the 15 year old boy he was when he left.<br /><br />This movie is amazing. The cast is wonderful, and the soundtrack is the greatest ever put onto a film (this can be said for several of Crowe's film soundtracks). "Almost Famous" is a film you'll want to watch again and again.</p></body></html>

The daughter of a powerful political figure is kidnapped and thrown into a global sex ring. Of course it's up to Scott (Val Kilmer) and his special agents to track down the fools who dared to take that girl. Scott likes to ask bad guys questions with a repeated stiffness and then roughs them up. You'll have to see it, he's great. Other stars include Derek Luke, William H. Macy, and Ed O'Neill. And there are lots of conspiracy twists in the movie, so pay attention. You'll be glad that you did.</p></body></html>

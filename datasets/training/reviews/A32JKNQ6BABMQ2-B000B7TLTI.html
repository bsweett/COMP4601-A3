<meta name="summary" content="a big time marvel rip off"></head><body><p>well,this family is in the fedreal witness relocation program hiding out due to their super powers.theres the dad who has super strength like the thing from the fantastic four.his wife has powers much like those of mr fantastic from the ff.she stretches and stuff.the daughter can create invisible shields a lot like the invisible girl from the ff.the son runs really fast like quicksilverv from .........hahaha....the x-men.but,oh well,i guess theres only so many super powers to go around.the dad secretly goes about helping out anyhow and the ol lady finds out.of course she intervenes and makes everything way worse.the kids even get involved.the characters and the portrayal of thier unique abilities is done fantasticly.[hahaha].the part i liked was the super fast son,zipping through the jungle to escape the bad guys.i know that does it little justice but its the best part.trust me.its really cool for the kiddies and is thankfully free from the poop,fart, and puke humor the kid movies are so prone to these days.</p></body></html>

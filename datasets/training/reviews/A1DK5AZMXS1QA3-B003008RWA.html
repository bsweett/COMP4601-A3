<meta name="summary" content="Great commentary on the American political scene, but could have used more statistics"></head><body><p>I will begin this review by stating that I am a proud American citizen, an immigrant from a Third World country who grew up in America.  I have also traveled around the world, and have experienced the health care systems in other countries.  I also have friends and family living in other countries, both developed and under-developed countries.  From my own experiences in America and in other countries, and those related to me by my friends and family, I've come to believe that the US healthcare system is extremely inefficient, corrupt, and unfriendly to customers.  If one were to consider slavery as 19th century America's national shame, then healthcare is probably the shame of our time.  Many individuals have tried to describe the failings of America's health care system in editorials, books, and news reports.  But this 2-hr long documentary captures the essence of these failures; both cause and effect, and the agents.  Sicko correctly reveals the fundamental cause: greed, and the system whereby greed is allowed to take people's lives: a deregulated, privately run health care system.  Taken together, this leads to a health care safety net with very big holes.  Importantly, Moore focuses only on those who do have insurance, and shows the loopholes that allow health care providers to deny care.  So instead of coming of as a paean to the poor and uninsured, this movie actually looks at those that have been insured; the working professionals both blue and white collar.  And as a good liberal, Moore contrasts the American system with those in Canada, Cuba, France and England.<br /><br />The failings of this movie are also numerous.  First of, Moore fails to elucidate the specific laws that have created our current health care system.  He only looks at one specific bill passed during the Nixon administration that sanctioned HMO's as the pre-eminent form of health care provider in the US.  The movie should have spent some time presenting the origins of worker-provided care, the origins of France's present health care system under Vichy rule, and differences in the health care education in different countries.  The US is unique in that one needs an undergraduate degree before entering medical school.  This by itself dramatically increases the time and cost incurred by doctors in training, which in turn raises their salaries.<br /><br />The 2nd major failing of this documentary is the very incomplete comparison of the US health care system to those in other countries.  Specifically, there were no comparisons with health care systems in Asia, such as those of Singapore, China and India.  The latter two produce many of America's best doctors and medical researchers.  The former, Singapore, has probably the world's best health care system in terms of cost/benefit ratio, access by all citizens to latest technical advances, and a strong orientation on customer satisfaction.<br /><br />A third major failing, and the biggest surprise of this movie, was the complete absence of mention of patient privacy.  I suspect Moore examined Iceland's system and came away with more questions than answers as to the need of patient privacy.  And probably the biggest failing of this movie is the absence of aggregate statistics.  Yes, Mr. Moore provides prices that specific individuals have had to pay for specific medical services and goods.  But Mr. Moore does not include important statistics like the trend in HMO deductibles and premiums over time, trends in Medicare and Medicaid spending (overall and per capita) over time, comparisons of per capita medical costs across different countries, etc, etc...  Nobody can argue with numbers, but lots of people can argue with anecdotal evidence, which is what this documentary almost exclusively presents.<br /><br />But overall, I still like and recommend this movie.  I believe the facts presented in the movie are correct, and I agree with Mr. Moore's opinion.</p></body></html>

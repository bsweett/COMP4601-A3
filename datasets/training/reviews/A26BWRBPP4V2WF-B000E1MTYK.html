<meta name="summary" content="Too much plot for much exposition, but a lot of fun for experienced Harry Potter fans"></head><body><p>The earlier Harry Potter films have moments of quiet whimsy, where J.K. Rowling's universe is fleshed out.  This 4th installment, the Goblet of Fire, is so jam-packed that there is no time for anything that doesn't service one of the 2 main plots.  The first plotis about the Triwizard Tournament - a deadly competition to determine the greatest of the three magical schools: the British co-ed Hogwarts, the Bulgarian male-only Durmstrang, and the French all-girls school Beauxbaton.  This plot contains all the action of the film, and includes some dramatic special-effects sequences, including a battle with a dragon and a wand-weilding climactic battle.  The second plot contains the character-development aspects of the film: associated with the Triwizard Tournament is a Grand Ball, and our heroes must find dates and deal with puberty-induced angst.  Especially effective in this part of the film is Emma Watson's portrayal of nerdish Hermione.  Instead of being only the Mr. Spock-like logician to Ron and Harry, she gets to show some real emotion when Harry and Ron treat her like one of the guys, rather than see her as a date prospect for the ball.<br /><br />It is well that the filmmakers focussed on these two plots, as Rowling's book is 600+ pages.  Obviously, much of the detail of the book is missing.  For example, we only see one class during the entire year, and that is to introduce the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, who plays a pivotal role in the story.  We see not a single Potions class with Prof. Snape.  We don't even see Prof. Sprout (Herbology), a Quidditch match, a House Elf, or Nearly-Headless Nick.  Even so, newcomers to the series are likely to be scratching their heads in parts - for example, Harry contacts Sirius Black but no mention is made in the film who he is (he's Harry's godfather).<br /><br />That's not to say that the film isn't enjoyable or rich in detail.  If it takes a cavalier attitude in trimming all but the essentials from the two main plotlines, it must do so in order to keep the movie focussed.  At 2.5 hours, it's none too short, but the time flies by because the performances are very good and the action sequences last just long enough (but not too long!)<br /><br />This bare-bones DVD contains absolutely no extras - not even the audio commentary, not even the film's trailer.  I would recommend that anyone with even the remotest interest in the series should go with the special-edition 2-disc set instead (especially since it's the same price, at least it was when I wrote this review).</p></body></html>

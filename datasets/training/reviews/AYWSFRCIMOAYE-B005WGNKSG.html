<meta name="summary" content="Noomi Rapace's riveting acting + Complicated plot dealing with many problems in life + 4 big logical holes = Worth watching once"></head><body><p>WARNING:SPOILERS AHEAD!<br /><br />Firstly, I've not read the novel this movie is based on. So my comments are for this film only.<br /><br />Secondly, the most interesting about this picture is Noomi Rapace's engaging acting. She vividly played Lisbeth Salander who was a chain smoker, drinker and skillful computer hacker. What an attitude she had. She did not get mad, she always got even. There was more to her character but I would not reveal them here.<br /><br />Thirdly, the plot was complicated. It dealt with many problems such as police's power abuse, domestic violence, serial killing. These problems were depicted in many extremely disturbing scenes. They made me very angry seeing how much emotionally Lisbeth was suffering.  The plot also involves deep relationship between the  niece and her uncle. The uncle's love for his niece was strongly expressed from the beginning till the end. The last scene touched my heart.<br /><br />Fourthly, the most ridiculous aspect is this movie has at least 4 big logical holes that greatly erode my interest. If it had been a fantasy movie, I'd would have ignored its logic deficiency. However, it's a kind of detective and drama movie. So, logic is one of its foundations! I won't list all of the holes I found but one here. For example, after a member of Vanger family saved Mikael from being killed by the owner of the house he just broke in, he told his savior everything about his investigation. Consequently, he paid dearly later! Before that, the film had always shown most of the Vanger members including his savior just wanted him to go home. Why on earth, suddenly Mikael turned into a man with the brain of a junior high school student? Why many detective/investigative movies have the same problem? Because of this I gave this movie 3 stars.<br /><br />In short, it's worth watching once especially if you want something different from Hollywood stuff.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Probably the Best Sci-Fi Film of the 1990's"></head><body><p>Incredibly imaginative, ground-breaking visual effects, terrific acting, heavily atmospheric, crisply paced and written... it just works on every single level and it works brilliantly. Seeing this in the cinema the first time, my mouth was agape for a goodly portion of the film, particularly the "tuning" of the city sequences and the very memorable climax. This simply in one of the great Sci-Fi films of all time, and also goes into history with films like DARKMAN and THE MATRIX as the best comic-book films that weren't comic books, which is mostly due to Proyas' direction and the co-writing of David Goyer, who wrote the BLADE films, co-wrote BATMAN BEGINS, and has worked on several different actual comics over the years. Great, great film.</p></body></html>

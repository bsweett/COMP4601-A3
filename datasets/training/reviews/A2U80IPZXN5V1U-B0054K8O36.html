<meta name="summary" content="Not perfect but a satisfying new entry in the franchise"></head><body><p>It's already been four years since the last Pirates of the Caribbean movie, now Jack Sparrow and his matey's are returning for a third sequel with On Strangers Tide. This fourth Pirates of the Caribbean film is of course going to be a bit different from previous Pirates movie as a result of the original trilogy concluded and some characters that are no longer present.  This time the charismatic Jack Sparrow is on a new quest this time looking for the fountain of youth, with some old acquaintances of past making an appearance.  On Strangers Tide wastes no time and goes straight into action and asks questions later. There is more dialogue and development in the second half of the film than in the first half, where the viewer is thrown into action almost right away. Pirates of the Caribbean movies always take a certain time to really get started but this one is exception to the rule. At 137 minutes, On Strangers Tide is a little shorter than the previous two POTC films, Dead Man's Chest (2006) and At World's End (2007) but its length is still over 2 hours and comparable to The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)'s 143 minutes.<br /><br />Will and Elisabeth are not in this fourth film but I didn't miss them or at least not as much as I thought I would. While it would have been nice to see Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley return (maybe they will in a future Pirates who knows?), this movie kept me plenty interested and those actors not being present did not hurt the movie at all. Johnny Depp remains excellent as Jack Sparrow this fourth time around, as good as ever.  Geoffrey Rush was once more terrific as Barbossa. Penelope Cruz was great as Angelica, a former lover of Sparrow and daughter of Blackbeard. Depp and Cruz had on screen chemistry and were believable and worked out well. Ian McShane delivered a solid performance as Blackbeard but I guess I somehow expected him to be a more frightening character perhaps because of the Blackbeard legend. I can understand why some fans may not enjoy this fourth entry as much as the others. Some reviewers complained that the movie has too much action and maybe that's true but I can hardly see a fan of the series hating this one, liking it less or being disappointed perhaps. The fountain of youth was a decent enough storyline and the inclusion of the mermaids was a nice one and was very fitting into this Pirate universe (I still think they don't have fangs). To me, the mermaid attack scene shown in the previews is a highlight of the movie. I was slightly worried about the zombie pirates because I thought it may have been too over the top but that turned out fine as well. I quite liked the concept for this fourth film, the chase for the fountain of youth, and I thought the inclusion of famed pirate Blackbeard and the mermaids were interesting and in a way even breathed new life into the series while still being familiar and true to the previous films.<br /><br />As for the 3D effect I must say it was surprisingly good, I don't mean amazing or revolutionary but I simply like how the effects didn't overshadow any event or were purely useless. What we have with On Strangers Tide is an effective 3D and that's coming from someone who's not a fan of 3D films. They didn't make the movie about 3D which some modern movies do; this one doesn't rely solely on 3D effects because it doesn't have to.<br /><br />I like On Strangers Tide and find it to be a very enjoyable Pirates film overall, to me this one is much better than the third film, At World's End. On Strangers Tide may not be the best POTC movie but it has an interesting story, is entertaining and watchable which as far as sequels are concerned is always a good thing. I feel OST is maybe a little less complicated than earlier Pirates film, it's easier to follow that someone who has never seen any POTC films would not be lost. This is Definitely not the best in the series but to me is superior to the previous entry and manages to be a worthwhile sequel that was better than anticipated. It's been four years since the last POTC movie but even with two of the original characters gone, this one manages to be a very good sequel and perhaps, makes way for a new trilogy (there is after all, some talk about making 1 or 2 more movies). Some fans and critics didn't like it but I sure did. 4/5.</p></body></html>

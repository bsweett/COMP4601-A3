<meta name="summary" content="Unbelievable, but True!"></head><body><p>I heard about this story back in 1980 when the book came out.  So naturally, I was very interested in how the movie would play out.  The story of Frank W. Abagnale is told with some humor and some melodrama by Director Steven Spielberg.  DiCaprio and Hanks give very good performances in this unbelievable, but true tale.  Not one of Spielberg's best, but very entertaining.</p></body></html>

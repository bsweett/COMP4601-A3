<meta name="summary" content="The Crappening"></head><body><p>Wow, M Night has released another turdbomb. Whod-a-thunkit ?!? This might actually be his biggest turd to date. I say ''biggest'' because he ventured out of p-13ville and into Rated-Rcity for the 1st time...repeat after me.... BFD !!!!!!!!<br /><br />The Gist~ People are committing suicide for no apparent reason. They start out acting normal then stop in their tracks. Thers no reason as to why all of a sudden people are becoming insane. Examples; construction workers walking off rooftops, cops shooting themselves, etc. Theres no reason as to why its ''happening'' when it happens but thats the least of this turds problem. For those who dont know, the plants are attacking us ! OOOOoooo....... Not physically, but.....invisibly ?!? And not everyone. Just the extras. How you ask ?!? The plants are sending killer signals in the wind and mayhem soon follows.<br /><br />Pros~ Interesting premiss(probably ripped off from a better source). Decent begining (what movie nowadays doesnt have one of those ?). OK effects. It eventually had to end.<br /><br />Cons~ Where to begin...... The direction, writing, pacing, acting, music, no scares, no drama, crappy open-ended ending........ nothing in this worked at all.<br /><br />Im not a big mark wahlberg fan but he usually is reliable. Here i feel embarrassed for him. Not that M wrote anything for him to recite, but still. This will surely earn him a Razzie. Absolutely no one else faired any better than him. The worse of the bunch clearly is Zooey, she of the clueless big eyes. She has her Razzie locked in unless halle, j-lo, lilo or jessica alba make a movie soon. One must REALLY be a huge M Nightian to find an iota of anything worth praising.<br /><br />If i were santa, this would replace coal for sure.</p></body></html>

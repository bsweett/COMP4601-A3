<meta name="summary" content="Rocky Balboa really does Delivers!"></head><body><p>When I first heard about a new Rocky movie, like everyone else, I thought it was a bad idea. Make that a terrible idea. Forget his age, didn't anyone remember "Rocky V"? It wasn't popular. The "Rocky" franchise was dead after that film. Even though it wasn't an awful film, it wasn't good either. So, when Stallone made his big announcement of the new one, I greeted it with the same enthusiasm as any Stallone film. I just wasn't interested. After a lot of positive reviews for the new one, "Rocky Balboa," I decided see it.<br /><br />"Rocky Balboa" works and its a terrific film. Stallone wrote and directed it, and he does a great job. And not just with the fighting scenes. Believe it or not, the whole training and boxing scenes take up a small part of the film. The whole first half is just Rocky being Rocky. He visits Adrian's grave and the places where they used to spend time together. The film makes excellent use of the Philadelphia locations. From the little run down corner bars, the burned out houses, the city is as much a character in the film as Rocky is. There is a scene where Rocky stands on a street corner talking to someone, and the way he uses the locations is just perfect.<br /><br />I was kind of worried about Milo playing his son. Since he played Jess on "Gilmore Girls," I was worried he would be very Jess like, whining, and all surly and angry. And while his character starts out that way, he grows quite a bit. The relationship between he and his father is handled extremely well. And I especially liked the other relationship between Rocky and little Marie (Geraldine Hughes), a bartender he meets who he had met years before when she was a kid. While not a romance from the start, since he still is not over Adrian, this is one of the strongest parts of the film. Rocky befriends her and her son. Hughes gave a really nice performance in the film. In looking over her filmography, it looks like this is the first major role she has had.<br /><br />But, then there is Stallone. His last few movies have gone direct to video. I hope this changes that. I never expected to think he had this film in him. At 105 minutes, this is one of the shortest films this year. Yet, for the first time all year, I wish it was half an hour longer! I would have liked to have seen even more training. I think that is one of the strengths of Stallone as a filmmaker. He leaves you wanting more, rather than wearing out his welcome. If you have any desire to see a Rocky movie, this truly is a must see. I'm actually surprised I liked it as much as I did and one of the better films of that year.</p></body></html>

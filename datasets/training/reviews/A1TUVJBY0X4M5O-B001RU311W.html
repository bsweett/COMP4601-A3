<meta name="summary" content="Penn great, movie not quite..."></head><body><p>I came into the film knowing absolutely nothing about Harvey Milk.  Penn is as good as everyone has said; most of the time, due to his acting, I felt like I was watching a documentary.  Unfortunately, a documentary would probably be more interesting than the film.  It draaaaagged in spots and was mostly just unremarkable.  Giving away the ending up front didn't make any sense, and while the building of the movement was fun and interesting in spots, a bit more attention to the assassination would have been nice (or at least have it played for shock).  Some bits were fun, some bits were informative (e.g. the actual footage of gay bars around the U.S. being raided was pretty interesting), some touching...but mostly it's not something I'd recommend.  I think they should have cut some of his relationships out for example, I don't know, just get it a bit more brisk would be nice.</p></body></html>

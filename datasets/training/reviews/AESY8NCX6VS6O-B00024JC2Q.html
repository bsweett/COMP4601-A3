<meta name="summary" content="Uneven, but turns out to be diverting and fun..."></head><body><p>I remember having a discussion with a friend, once, about people in high school and how there are three groups of them - (1) the ones you hate, (2) your friends, and then the third group: the people that you could live without, but you simply don't have the energy to actively dislike them...so you're nice to 'em. Watching Starsky and Hutch last night, I realized that those three groups totally apply to movies, also - filth like Welcome To Mooseport easily falls into that first category, masterful cinema like The Passion slides into the second one, and then...well...stuff like Starsky and Hutch goes right into that third category. Unlike director Todd Philips' earlier films, Road Trip and Old School, there's a sweet, harmless quality to Hutch that, even though I can't say I loved it, I enjoyed myself. <p>  The '70's cop show isn't so much parodied in the movie but used as a springboard to pair Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, who - with the right project (The Royal Tenenbaums) - can rock. It's kind of a Felix and Oscar cliche, but Stiller's Starsky is the fastidious, by-the-book cop and Wilson's Hutch just knows a little too much about cocaine. The movie predates the show, imagining how the two got together and then throwing them into various situations that sometimes score and other times fall completely flat. Snoop Dog's bit part as Huggy Bear just didn't do anything for me - usually, that '70's blaxploitation schtick is hilarious (i.e. Undercover Brother or anything on Chapelle's Show), but he fits in like an afterthought, the director trying to pull to another demographic. What does work, though, is a great scene where Starsky accidentally ingests cocaine and excitedly enters a disco contest. Or an undercover bit near the end of the film that you might have caught in the trailer (remember the horse in the garage?). I'll admit, I almost needed a catheter in certain scenes.<p>  Then again, S&H can just be kind of stagnant at times, desperately attempting to be funny and not succeeding. Stretches of the movie were laughless and restlessness sets in...BUT - as much as I want to dislike this movie, I just can't. At the end, when the movie could have committed the carnal sin of overkill, it ends before it wears out its welcome. Nothing in it is really offensive, tasteless, or awful, and that's a rarity in buddy comedies these days. Stiller is looking more and more like a star in every movie he does, too (the vomit-worthy Along Came Polly notwithstanding) - most of the comedy in the movie is thanks to his awesome talent for playing off of that faux-macho persona that works so well for him. And then Will Ferrell - ahh, Will. Where do I start? The man is a riot, and a cameo that he has may as well be the single funniest scene of the whole film (he gets the privelige of alluding to the homoerotic speculation that was rampant during Starsky's run in the '70's).<p>  When TV show rehashes are done correctly, they can be brilliant (look at the genius Brady Bunch parody), and when they're done wrong, they can be freaking awful (Leave it to Beaver), but Starsky and Hutch is really neither. It tows the line and makes it a worthwhile experience in the end, and an albeit hilarious one, at times. It's occasionally dumb, it has an interminably slow first act, and I can't say I'd watch it again. I can't say I didn't have fun the first time, either. GRADE: B-</p></body></html>

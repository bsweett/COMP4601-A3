<meta name="summary" content="Added scenes on DVD make the beginning boring for kids."></head><body><p>I fondly remember this movie and looked forward to watch it<br /><br />with my 7 year old.  Unfortunately, the added scenes on Krpton<br /><br />drag the movie out waaayy too long(154 minutes!).  Maybe the<br /><br />superman purists find this incredibly interesting, but for kids it's a drag.  Superman doesn't even appear flying in his uniform<br /><br />until about 50 minutes into the movie!  This movie could be awesome for kids if it was cut down to about 1 hr 50 min., as<br /><br />the caped crusader provides an awesome role model for kids (never lies, fights for justice, and respects his parents! haha).  Anyways, it's still a classic worth seeing, just skip<br /><br />the first 30 minutes until the part where the baby/toddler of steel is in space and about to reach earth.  (-:</p></body></html>

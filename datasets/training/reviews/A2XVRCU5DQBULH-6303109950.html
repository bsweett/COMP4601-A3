<meta name="summary" content="A great western, a remarkable movie..."></head><body><p>This isn't what the ol' west was all about. This is what Hollywood films are all about: big casts, large conflict, and compelling characters. It's all set to the backdrop of Tombstone, a large town in the ol' west where Wyat Earp and his two brothers decide to retire to and make a small fortune in silver. Doc Holliday also lives there, winning card games like Mark Maguire makes home runs. But the outlaw gang the Cowboys are menacing the town and stirring up trouble. Reluctantly, the Earps and Holliday come out of retirement to fight back and defend their town. This is an extremely remarkable film with great acting, a thick plot, and some suspense-filled shoot-outs. It's a must-see for any movie buff. One of the best westerns also made.</p></body></html>

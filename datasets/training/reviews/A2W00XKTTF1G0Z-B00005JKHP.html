<meta name="summary" content="Not Motionless Anymore!"></head><body><p>I used to call this the &quot;Motionless Picture&quot;. I am a big fan of Star Trek and I saw it in the theatre when it premiered in 1979, but except for the &quot;Tour Around The ENTERPRISE&quot; the V'ger Story fell short for me.<p>Sure it was exciting seeing everyone back and being introduced again, but the STory was not original and very boring - espeically the V'Ger fly-by's. Yuch.<p>Now the Directors DVD edition is out and it is much better. Better images, enhanced and added scenes and the commentaries are really good.<p>The DVD didn't change the overall film, but it definately works better on the small screen and the directors edition is worth it. Keep on Trekkin'!</p></body></html>

It sat in my box for a long time and I slowly worked its way up the Netflix queu.<br /><br />That said, it's one of those pleasant surprises because you go in expecting it to be mediocre and it was great to superb.<br /><br />Story follows an LA negotiator who has an unsettling encounter that makes him retire as a sheriff to a small town.  It's a year later and a rich family are behind held hostage forcing the negotiator to relive his traumatic past.<br /><br />Willis plays the star.  His daughter in the movie is his daughter in real life.  Kevin Pollack, who I remember best as the American President caught in a blizzard in DETERRENCE (i.e. if you check that one out, look for a small role played by Sean Astin among some other notable names).  Another small role is played by the actress who played Mrs. Landingham, the President's first secretary, from the WEST WING.  Her name is Kathryn Joosten.<br /><br />Lots of twist and turns with tense moments. Subplot story going on between Willis and his wife who are nearing divorce.  Looks for the criss cross of three car moments and the villain and Willis saying the same thing.  Strange connections.  I won't say more or I'll give a spoiler.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></body></html>

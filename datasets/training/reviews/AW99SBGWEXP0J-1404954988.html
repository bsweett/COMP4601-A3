<meta name="summary" content="Spanglish"></head><body><p>"Spanglish" is told through the eyes of Christine (Bruce), a Mexican girl who comes to America with her mother Flor (Vega).  Flor resists Americanization as much as she can, but when taking a job as a housekeeper for the Claskys, she realizes that that is easier said than done.  The Claskys are a well to do family headed by renowned chef John (Sandler).  He is the "good" parent and a all around nice guy.  His wife, Deborah (Leoni) is out of work not a very pleasant person.  Her relationships with her husband and daughter are strained.  Flor's insertion into the family mix causes changes in everyone, mostly for the better.  Soon, Flor and her daughter are moving into a summer home with the Claskys, and cultures begin to seriously clash.<br /><br />"Spanglish" does not really have a plot so much as it examines a period of the characters' lives.  Since it is told through Christine's eyes, there is not as much resolution as many may like.  Instead, the story is strong on character, developing the three primary characters fully.<br /><br />Adam Sandler gives another solid dramatic performance (his first was the offbeat "Punch Drunk Love").  He is the nice guy, and is easy to like.  You feel for the guy as he has his ups and downs, and genuinely want him to succees.  T&eacute;a Leoni brings believability to the bitchy wife.  Self centered and oblivious to other's feelings, Deborah is a character that you do not want to like.  Cloris Leachman brings some comic relief as Deborah's mother.  Finally Paz Vega does a solid job as the woman caught between cultures, struggling to do what is right for herself and her daughter.<br /><br />Despite the good performances, "Spanglish" felt like a bit of a misfire to me.  I wanted more than I got out of it.  Perhaps it was the unlikeability of some characters or the lack of a real plot, I do not know.  In the days since I saw the movie, I have softened my review some, but I still can only recommend this on DVD.</p></body></html>

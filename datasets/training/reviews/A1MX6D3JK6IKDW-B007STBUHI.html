<meta name="summary" content="FISHY"></head><body><p>Movie that terrified the entire country over 30 years ago is logically flawed from the start. 3 people are killed by shark attacks before the mayor and chamber of coommerce assent to closing off the waters of Amity Island to swimmers. National news reporters are on the scene,yet no request for Coast Guard intervention takes place.Finding and killing this stupendous shark is farmed out to Shaw, using his own boat, probably not safe in a swimming pool.Police chief Schneider and shark expert Dreyfus hop sboard to help save lives and the movie's credibility. They succeed thanks to terrific acting, frighteningly good photography, a lightning pace, and great background music by John Williams. Ironically, it's Shaw who's consumed by pride and stubborness, while the novices reap the joy of victory. The film is timeless and will still give viewers of all ages all that they can swallow.</p></body></html>

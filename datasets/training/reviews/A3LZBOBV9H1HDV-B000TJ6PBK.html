Jackson (as Gerald Olin) is great. The directing by Mikael Hafstrom (who also directed "Derailed" (2005) is great. The screenplay by Matt Greenberg (who also wrote the screenplay to "Halloween H20: 20 Years Later" (1998), Scott Alexander, & Larry Karaszewski (both who also wrote the upcoming "Cell" (2007), based on the novel also by King), based on the short story by Stephen King, is great. The music by Gabriel Yared (who also did the music to "Breaking And Entering" (2006) is excellent. The cinematography by Benoit Delhomme (who also did the cinematography to "Breaking And Entering") is excellent. The film editing by Peter Boyle (who also did the film editing to "Derailed" & "The Hours" (2002), which he was nominated for an Oscar) is great. The casting by Elaine Grainger & Lucinda Syson (who also did the casting to "Children Of Men" (2006) is great. The production design by Andrew Laws (who also did the production design to "Derailed" & "The Number 23" (2007) is excellent. The art direction by Stuart Kearns (who also did the art direction to "Batman Begins" (2005) & Doug J. Meerdink (who also did the art direction to "Ocean's Thirteen" (2007) is excellent. The set decoration by Daniel B. Clancy (who also did the set decoration to "Derailed" & "The Number 23") & Marina Morris is excellent. The costume design by Natalie Ward (who also did the costume design to "Derailed" & "Breaking And Entering" is great. This is an interesting suspense-horror-psychological thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. This is one of the better horror films in recent history.</p></body></html>

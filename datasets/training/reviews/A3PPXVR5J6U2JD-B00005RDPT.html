I mean -- it's cool. The movie is genuinely cool. Watching it, you are convinced you probably look cool. Walking around with the DVD, you can imagine it will help you pick up chicks (it won't). But still, you can hope that the coolness inherent in this movie to rub off on you. It's THAT cool. <p>And with good reason. George Clooney. Brad Pitt. Bernie Mac. Matt Damon. Julia Roberts. That's a lot of slick actors in one package. <p>Clooney plays Danny Ocean, a recently divorced, recently released from prison con man. His ex-wife, who he is still very much in love with, has shacked up with a real creep -- an arrogant man who puts money before everything else. Danny sets out to get back at him in a rather extravagant way. He gets ten of his old buddies together and they take on the most oturageous heist in history. <p>The plot is about taking down not one, not two, but THREE casinos at the same time. It's full of manly, geeky fun. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously (how could it?), but the cast is obviously having so much fun that you can't help but enjoy yourself. I never saw the original -- but if it had half the charm this movie does, it must have been cool indeed. <p>Carl Reiner is excellent as a grumpy old conman. Shaobo Qin players a convincing acrobat (who doesn't talk much). There's two brothers who bicker all the time and you can't tell if it's part of the con or not. In fact, the whole movie plays with the audience -- is it really a con? Because of its playful tone, you forgive it for fooling you more than once, sometimes with the same trick. <p>The one weak point is Don Cheadle. He's a black guy playing a black guy with a...bizarre (Australian? Cockney?) accent. It sounds like me doing an accent. And I sound fake when I do it. <p>There are a few other moments that dim the glow of this movie -- Maleficent pointed out that Julia Roberts can't walk like a lady and apparently either no one's telling her or she just doesn't care. She stumps around onscreen like Lenny from the Grapes of Wrath. It's embarassing. The director tries to compensate, but fails -- in one scene, she's supposed to be sashaying across the screen, but instead ends up gallumphing by instead. For such a pretty lady that's supposed to be a real class act, it shatters the illusion. <p>But that's me being nitpicky. This movie is excellent. For any guy who has ever wanted to be cool...or in this day and age, isn't sure what cool is in anymore...this movie will help guide the way.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Pretty Movie"></head><body><p>When I saw previews for this movie, I thought it was a Baz Luhrman movie. But then I found it was a Sofia Coppola movie. Not a big fan of this chick. Let me be honest. The Virgin Suicides was interesting, but disturbing and not all there. Lost in Translation was just that: lost in translation. But Marie Antoinette manages to deliver. Kinda. The movie's not as fast paced, not as colorful, not as musical, as you may think. The use of modern music, a la A Knight's Tale, is cool, but way under-used. I say that if you're going to do something modern with a period piece, you might as well go all out. The movie teeters between being flashy and cool and boring and dramatic. It never quite decides what it wants to be. And that's really my only beef with this flick. Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman are awesome. The costumes are amazing. And the story is involved, detailed, informative, and interesting.<br /><br />The movie centers around the marriage of Marie Antoinette, daughter of the Queen of Austria, to the French dauphin. Everyone's counting on her to produce an heir to the throne, but she and her husband aren't even sleeping together. They haven't even consummated the marriage. Every morning, there's a huge rigamoroll involving the entire court just to get Marie dressed. Then everyone watches as she eats. You can see on her face that she hates the hoity-toity customs, but she lives with it anyway. It really is a blow by blow of this chicks life, and one thing after another happens. Rent it. Enjoy it. May not be the best movie (it's a little slow), but it's worth a look see.</p></body></html>

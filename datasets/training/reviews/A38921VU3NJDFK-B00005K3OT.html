<meta name="summary" content="Chocolat (2000)"></head><body><p>Chocolat is a movie of sentiments, and it certainly flaunts its sentiments proudly -- a stubborn quality that just as certainly lessens the film's overall dramatic weight. But at some point, its scrumptious heart melts its viewers into drooling weepers ready and hungry for its fairytale framework. And once that happens -- perhaps only minutes after the opening sequences, or maybe after its final ones -- it's more than difficult to shake its warmth. To call the movie inspiring may be too generous, but it more than deserves to be called uplifting. And it is.</p></body></html>

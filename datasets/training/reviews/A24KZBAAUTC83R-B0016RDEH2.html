Good production and special effects, but overall storyline was lacking. I guess you have to be a fan of the comic. We're not.<br /><br />But Pan's Labyrinth is a true classic original in all ways. Not for the tender-hearted children under the age of 13. Both beautiful, surreal and imaginative, as well as horrific and edgy in its stylistic approach, Deltoro's Pan's Labyrinth is a truly one-of-a-kind movie experience.<br /><br />His best movie is yet to be made. Look for his rendition of Tarzan of the Apes.</p></body></html>

They do anything for a laugh, and ad libbing was encouraged by director Adam McKay, but it often veers off track, and the story is pretty stupid. It just doesn't make sense, half the time. That being said, it has some of the funniest scenes ever filmed, and I'm sure there were a lot of laughs, on screen and off.<br /><br />It begins with the following narration, spoken by announcer Bill Lawson: "There was a time, a time before cable. When the local anchorman reigned supreme. When people believed everything they heard on TV. This was an age when only men were allowed to read the news. And in San Diego, one anchorman was more man then the rest. His name was Ron Burgundy. He was like a god walking amongst mere mortals. He had a voice that could make a wolverine purr and suits so fine they made Sinatra look like a hobo. In other words, Ron Burgundy was the balls."<br /><br />There is the movie in a nutshell. It is very funny in spurts, but spins out of control just as often. The problem is that the funniest parts could also be the out of control ones. Will Ferrell is excellent as Ron Burgundy, all empty headed and puffed up with self importance. There are great scenes of the news team doing the purposeful walk, wearing 70s style suits, it is so right on and true to the period.<br /><br />Another problem is the theme of a woman breaking into the male dominated world of TV News. It tries to be too PC, and that gets in the way of the comedy. Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) doesn't know if she wants to play it as a professional or a conniving slattern. Does she loath Ron Burgundy or love him? If she is as intelligent as she appears, then how could she love someone as ignorant as Burgundy? Should the movie mock her, or should it just mock Ron and the other male chauvinists?<br /><br />I like the part where Ron Burgundy comes home and talks to his dog, Baxter. Also outstanding was the scene where Ron Burgundy jams at a jazz club with his flute. There is a running gag where the other news teams rumble, and one of them gets his arm ripped off. Later, when everyone is trying to cover the Panda being born at the San Diego Zoo, he is shown with one arm. I just wish they could have shown as much care for the other plot lines that led nowhere.<br /><br />I want to emphasize that I think this is a very funny movie, and I recommend it, but it gets silly at times. There are some very funny people in it. Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Steve Carrell, Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Fred Armisen, Vince Vaughn, Fred Willard, Owen Wilson, and Chris Parnell, as well as co-anchors Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate. Four of them have double L's in their names.<br /><br />Good Night, San Diego, Stay Classy.</p></body></html>

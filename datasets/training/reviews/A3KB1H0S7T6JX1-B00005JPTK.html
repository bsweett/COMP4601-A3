<meta name="summary" content="Here There Be Darkseekers!"></head><body><p>I Am Legend brings to the screen the story of what appears to be the sole healthy survivor of a human-evoked biological catastrophe who spends the remainder of his life searching for a cure during the day and fending off the infected survivors during the night. At first it might seem like an improbable scenario, but Hollywood has been noted (surprisingly or not so surprisingly) to foresee destructive events before (e.g. Wag the Dog-instead of Albania it was Yugoslavia, The Day after Tomorrow-instead of ice it's hurricanes, Deep Impact-instead of a tidal wave hitting the USA it hits Indonesia and Sri Lanka, Outbreak-instead of the Ebola-like virus it's SARS and/or the bird flu, etc), The Island-and the real prospect of the production of human clones for `spare parts,' etc.<br />The film does a good job of getting the message across, as it should do, in making people aware that messing around with viruses and genetic engineering will sooner or later lead to a mistake that mankind will regret. It is inevitable.<br />In addition, the movie should have been rated R and not PG-13.<br />In short, Will Smith's acting, the plot, and the setting, are all very good, and I Am Legend is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over!<br /><br />PS Just wondering if someone could shed some light as to whose trap he springs and falls into?</p></body></html>

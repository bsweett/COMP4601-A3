<meta name="summary" content="Fun and Silly Disaster Flick"></head><body><p>I'm a big fan of "Disaster" movies, so when a geologist friend recommended I check out "The Core," I was pleasantly surprised. The Core is an engaging but fluffy bit of pseudo-science. The Premise? When the Earth's molten core stops 'rotating' due to mankind's tampering, it wreaks havoc with the Earth's environment, resulting in widespread natural disasters and eventual global destruction.<br /><br />Who can save us? Yes, believe it or not COLLEGE PROFESSORS  can save us. Yes, that's right...Not only is there a Santa Claus Virginia, but Earth will be saved by an Academic! If I weren't too busy laughing at the idea, I would've enjoyed the film even more. Ludicrousness aside, you have the usual group of characters. The hot-shot (and oh-so-cute) stronaut, the misunderstood scientist, the cowardly rich boy, the dedicated professor, and the wizened veteran, each one contributes something to the team and some pay the ultimate price. (I'll let you guess who).<br /><br />This was a fun, but predicable film. If you like "Volcano" and all those movies about Asteroids hitting earth, you'll like this one. Mindless fun.</p></body></html>

First Blood is a definite one-man war film. In it, there is a good deal of a character battle with the elements of nature. A three-sided perspective to the story makes this plot grow. The yarn of how the stubbornness of an authority can cost more than it should. At times, First Blood is tedious, but Stallone engenders back the energy with his presence, even when unexpectedly. Of course, there is an occasional bad acting by the characters of the police force. First Blood is easily watchable and very entertaining, although slow at times.<br /><br />10/07: First Blood is the kind of a film that it is possible to enjoy the story while presenting a pretty bad message. No doubt, First Blood is a great action flick, but I feel it could have been much more. There aren't enough of explosions, action scenes, and mano a mano battles. I could say that the film felt hasty rather than deliberately paced to let the story unfold and evolve, similar to Where Eagles Dare. Sylvester Stallone proves why he is a great action star despite the fact that his acting became poor in the end. Although cleaver and innovative, First Blood is probably a classic in its own genre. Brian Dennehy is a much underrated actor, and he shows the usual performance in First Blood that makes him a great supporting actor. If it isn't for him, I don't think First Blood would've worked out. Also, I wish David Caruso's character is tortured more to the extremes before suffering his fate during First Blood, but I am disappointed. Richard Crenna is well known for his associations with Rambo movies, but he isn't much of an actor. First Blood isn't an exception. Interestingly, (although I read that it was four) only one character died in the movie in spite of the fact that First Blood is known for violence. There is a lot of great scenes during First Blood especially when Rambo gets out of the basement of a police station. Then there is the jump from the cliffs onto the trees. Moreover there is a great scene, considering that Stallone actually did a partial stunt and ended up breaking several ribs. I am not sure if I do totally like the ending, but it is an ending...all right. One phenomenon, which is very fascinating, of Rambo movies is that John Rambo is well-known just because of the second and third parts, but this film First Blood is so little recognized that it might have not existed at all. So, people may have been fooled into thinking that the second part is actually the original because First Blood, as the first part of the series, is wildly out of the context when we think of Rambo being in some Vietnam jungle. A fantastic line came in the middle of the film is when John Rambo says to Sheriff Teasle, "I'll give you a war you won't believe." Yeah, that's a classic. I'll have to comment on the ill-conceived message that First Blood brings forth. There are thousands of Vietnam survivors, but the problem is, what does it make Rambo any different from them? The subtlety here is that when you are frustrated and being pushed around, you nuke a town. Yeah, it might work in a while, but is it logical? Is there anything valid behind the point? Not really; that's why I just didn't buy the message in whole for First Blood. Two separate entities involved in First Blood: great action flick but awry message.<br /><br />7/11: Raising my rating of First Blood from `7' to `8', it is difficultly impossible to compare the original with the next two sequels because they are so vastly different in its makeup. I still must give a lot of credit to Sylvester Stallone for his creativity and genius in making watchable, well-acted action flicks, and First Blood is no exception. It is a thrilling film to watch and a very interesting one at that. As surprising as it seems to be, there is only one death in First Blood, and Rambo had nothing to do with it. Also, it is an interesting movie for giving much attention to Vietnam Vets for their difficulty in reintegrating back into society. The ending is dramatic as well. All in all, First Blood is a unique film to watch.</p></body></html>

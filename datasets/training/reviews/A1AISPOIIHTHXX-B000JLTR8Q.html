While with that film, it came after the hugely successful Signs so there was no need for concern until people saw it. Now mind you, the Village wasn't terrible but it was a case of a huge missed opportunity. With this film it was more like "oh boy, here we go" as if we knew it would be just like the Village. Now regardless of his faults and strengths as a filmmaker, he always told stories that I liked seeing: paranormal stories that were not just simply mob movies or officers turning rogue to take down a criminal. Well Lady in the Water certainly has an intriguing premise, but maybe somebody should've helped out with the story too.<br /><br />Cleveland is a superintendent working at an apartment complex called the Cove. One night, he spots someone in the pool when no one should be there and he accidentally slips and falls in. He's saved by a woman named Story and turns out she's a "narf" from a place called the Blue World and her coming will promote great change. Like any Eastern legend come to life, they must have enemies and in a narf's case it's a "scrunt": a big wolf that looks like vines and grass. Cleveland with a handful of tenants have to somehow get Story to the Blue World before the scrunt gets her.<br /><br />Now, I'm an RPG player like Final Fantasy and an anime watcher like Escaflowne so a story like that to me doesn't illicit unintentional laughter. But they are certain points where it got kind of not really silly but you know people would see it like so. An example is a character who gets wisdom from cereal boxes (seriously) and you almost wish someone was there near Shyamalan's shoulder going "um, might want to change that". But then when you think things are fine, then comes trouble spots. A snooty, humorless film and book critic in one scene actually deconstructs the situation he's in typically found in movies and probably worst of all: the director himself has a bigger role than before who's writing promotes great change. I don't mind director cameos or roles in film and I don't find him a bad actor but when his character gets that kind of importance it's like "heh heh, you wish buddy." Whether it is ego or just simply a wink to the audience though, who knows.<br /><br />One thing that Shyamalan always had a knack for though is casting and atmosphere. Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard both are great and the rest, while not given much to do, at least don't feel disposable. Directing is not as overtly flashy and he certainly knows how to frame a scene and the scrunt, while not given the more "less is more" approach like Signs, is downright cool and even scary. The only thing that kind of derails the film is the pacing is not as forwarding as it should be. It's not a slow moving film but it doesn't have that huge sense of urgency or dynamics that it should. It's only when that big dog shows up that things start ramping up.<br /><br />Some people own all his films since Sixth Sense as a "collection" while some own just some. Lady in the Water is in the grey area: you might like it, you probably will hate it but don't think you're going to see an outright terrible movie like Glitter, Battlefield Earth or a Uwe Boll movie.</p></body></html>

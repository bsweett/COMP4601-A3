<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful Tale Of The Changing West!"></head><body><p>Kevin Costner certainly has a way with a camera, offering up some of the most memorable cinematography of the American West since his classic "Dances With Wolves" in this stirring tale of the fateful changes sweeping over the range with coming of greater population and the need to share the range with others. Indeed, one often has the sense that Costner would rather tool away all the time he has on sweeping vistas and incredible sunsets than on character development. Still, this movie reminds one very much of Steve McQueen's elegant performance in "Tom Horn" in its portrayal of men caught in changes they neither appreciate nor understand on either side of the cultural divide between warring factions in this sometimes terrific movie.  It also recalls other memorable movies such as "Pale Rider" and even "Shane" in its depiction of a reluctant bad man forced by dint of circumstance to strap on his gun just one more time. <p>The cast is all superb, from Costner, as a man with a violent past who is left with little choice but to ply his trade in murder and mayhem to protect all he values, to Robert Duvall, as his struggling trail boss, to Annette Benning as the love interest for Costner's character. Michael Gambon camps it up as the sleazy bad guy doomed to face Costner's eventual rage, and the posse of range warriors he has in tow is also quite formidable and suitably doomed for destruction. The story is quite predictable, the issues over the range war are fairly well developed, and we all know that while Costner and Duvall are battling against the future, we understand they will lose the battle and then gracefully surrender to the forces of modernity over time. This is another terrific western, along the lines of "Unforgiven" and a number of the others mentioned above, and this one is certainly worth a gander. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

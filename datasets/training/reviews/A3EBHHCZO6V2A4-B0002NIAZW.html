<meta name="summary" content="Good for a disaster movie"></head><body><p>Disaster movies are a mixed bag.There are Irwin Allen's famous all-star epics such as "Earthquake" and "Towering Inferno",while there are the bland Asteroid Clones "Armageddon" and "Deep Impact." The "Day After Tomorrow" has amazing visuals, and for two hours,it'll keep you interested.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid,as in "Frequency",stars as a climatologist father reconnecting with his son.Jake Gyllenhaal rises above the mediocre script,showing why he is also great in "October Sky" and "Brokeback Mountain." Gyllenhaal's adventures as a math boy genius are riveting.Ian Holm's role as a Scottish scientist is minor&barely noticeable.Similarly,Emily Rossum is a bland love interest.There's a Dick Cheney-like vice president,and this movie was released not too long before Al Gore's Oscar-winning "Inconvenient Truth."<br /><br />The movie's strengths are the plot and special effects.There's plenty of suspense,and the sight of New York City in a new Ice Age is amazing. It makes a perfect two hours of entertainment!</p></body></html>

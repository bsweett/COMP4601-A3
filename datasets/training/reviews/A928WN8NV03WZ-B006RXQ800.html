<meta name="summary" content="Most underrated movie of the year"></head><body><p>One thing that can be said about Scorsese is that he has a passion for history.  Some of his most famed movies(Goodfellas, Casino) were based on true stories.  This movie shows all the same, it has the harsh realism that most of his movies, just as graphic and in some ways more so than Goodfellas.  With this movie he goes with the same formula as he did with with Casino.  He tells a story, and he does his best to pull us into the era that the story was in.<p>In this case it is based off Irish Immigrants in the times before and during the Civil war, climaxing with the infamous Draft Riots of NY.  It is based off of a character played by Leanardo DiCaprio, called Amsterdam Vallon.  He witnessed his father die in a brutal gang fight when he was 8, and wants revenge.  He is put away into an orphanage of sorts and when he is released years later immediately begins his plans of revenge.  He decides that his fathers killer, William Cutting, is too dangerous and decides to play at being his friend, but he starts to feel an attachment, and his plans are brought into question.<p>This movie had mixed reviews and it is one of those movies that you will either like or love.  The main problem that a lot of people had with it was it was too long.  Though that is more of a patience level issue than anything to do with unecessary scenes.  There are scenes that could be cut, but they don't really take away from the movie in a whole.  They are similar to scenes in Casino, he was trying to make you feel that you are in civil war era New York and it shows.  They constructed the set in Europe and it has a gritty feeling to it that is lacking in cgi generated cityscapes.<p>This movie has a lot of great points.  First off most of the acting was excellent.  <p>Daniel Day Lewis was amazing as the vicious bigot William Cutting.  He is barely recognizable as he is in other movies, here he is William Cutting(Bill the Butcher).  Based off a real life person of that same era.  He was a member of the know nothings(political group), and may have been a member of anti immigrant gangs.  In this he is part of a group of laborers that form a gang that is patriotic and believe that immigrants of that era are taking away the American Dream.  He defeats the immigrant gangs in the early part of the movie in a bloody battle, and rules the NY underwold from then on with an iron fist.  No one has either the courage or skill to match him.  <p>Cameron Diaz is playing an unusual character for her.  A bitter and streetwise girl named Jenny Everdene.  She's a pickpocket, a house thief, and prostitute.  Diaz looks good as a redhead, she also is believable as a street girl.  Her character is pretty but not gorgeous, tough but not necessarily smart, quick thinker but not a far thinker, good with charming people but short tempered and mean, etc.....<p>Brenden Gleeson plays an interesting role in the character Walter 'Monk' McGinn.  Another character from history they changed slightly for the movie, he wasn't in the time period of this movie, but the character fits.  He is a somewhat noble, but bitter, and a  street fighter, a renowned one.  He carries a club with him that he notches for every man he kills.<p>Jim Broadbent plays the infamous William &quot;Boss&quot; Tweed, part of the Tammany Hall political group.  Who genuinely seems to enjoy this role, one of the most corrupt politicians in American History.<p>That wasn't the only good part of the movie.  The costumes and cinematography was excellent.  The story was interesting and moving, I really got to like the characters and was interested in what happened.  The treatment of history was good despite the minor changes they made.  As well as the classically brutal action sequences, gang fights with clubs, axes, swords, etc....<p>The only really bad parts of this movie that I see is the acting job by Leonardo DiCaprio, whom looks the role of some street tough, scowling and looking thuggish even at times of peace.  But just didn't seem like he was into the role, that his mind was elsewhere.  The delivery of his lines just didn't feel real.<p>All in all I give this movie four stars, I would give it five, but the lead character was just too poorly chosen.  Though he looks right, he just takes away from the story.</p></body></html>

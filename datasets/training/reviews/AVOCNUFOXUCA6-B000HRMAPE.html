<meta name="summary" content="Decent action movie"></head><body><p>MI3 is a big-budget summer actioner, with all the pros and cons of that genre, plus its own strong and weak points.  The big set pieces are here; the huge action sequences and the explosions; the Unkillable Hero and the Omnipotent Bad Guy; the exotic locations.<br /><br />Tom Cruise proves he can still act, and still retains tremendous likability on screen, regardless of his bizarre couch-jumping, postpartum mother berating, cult-supporting antics off-screen.  His co-stars turn in  credible to good performances as well.  J.J. Abrams does an amazing job of directing; it's hard to believe he had never directed a feature film before.  To pull off a huge big-budget summer blockbuster like this the first time out of the gate is impressive.<br /><br />So why just 3 stars?  The problem with MI3 is ultimately the script.  Implausible actions and dialogue by the characters take you out of the movie and make you scratch your head.  And a movie like this, with such impossible action sequences, has to have something of a sense of humor about itself to allow you to suspend disbelief.  "Charlie's Angels" is a prime example of this, where you believe that anything can happen in Angelworld and you just roll with it.  MI3, on the other hand, is so deadly serious about itself that you can't suspend your disbelief about some of the stunts and action sequences.  It needed to have either less over-the-top action or less leaden seriousness; the two did not work together at all.<br /><br />Nevertheless, MI3 is at least worth a rent if you generally like this sort of movie.</p></body></html>

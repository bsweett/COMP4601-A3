I think anyone who has ever worked in an office will identify with all of the characters.  There are days when I feel that the lead character played by Ron Livingston was based on my life.  I must be &quot;having a case of the Mondays&quot;  I used to work with a guy who insisted on only using his personal antique stapler. If anyone ever finds a hypnotist that can zap me into not knowing I went to work - please find me. Until then, I will continue to arrive late to work, enter through the back door, zone out for an hour pretending to work, and get an actual fifteen minutes of work done every day.  This movie gets funnier every time. Everyone who commutes to work, especially in California, will also identify with the traffic scenes. After seein the movie, I can now at least smile a little thinking about how funny everyday, mundane life can really be.</p></body></html>

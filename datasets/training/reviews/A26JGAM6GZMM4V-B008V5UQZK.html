<meta name="summary" content="A Big Fat Celebration of Our Shared Humanity"></head><body><p>Like everybody else, I appreciate knowing in advance if a film is poor so I can avoid it; also, I prefer to "discover" an especially enjoyable film rather than hear or read raves about it in advance. This is one of three films I saw for the first time without knowing anything about them, the other two being Good Will Hunting and Bend It Like Beckham. Although I consider none a "great film," I thoroughly enjoyed all three but for different reasons I shall briefly discuss.<p>Directed by Joel Zwick and starring Nia Vardalos (also author and screenwriter) as Toula, with Lainie Kazan (her mother Maria) and Michael Constantine (her father Gus) cast in important supporting roles, this film really could have portrayed any large and loving family's "big fat wedding." Growing up in a multi-ethnic neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago, I had numerous opportunities to attend weddings and receptions which were strikingly similar to those portrayed in this film but, of course, I had no idea what was happening as members of both families were involved in preparations. Much of this film's great appeal is probably explained by the fact that so many people can identify with the pre-marriage stresses, temper tantrums, threats, tensions, conflicts, alienations, reconciliations, etc. which author Vardalos and director Zwick examine so brilliantly...and so humorously. <p>Toula works in her family's restaurant, Dancing Zorba, and her "Prince Charming" proves to be a schoolteacher, Ian Miller (John Corbett). They meet, fall in love, and become engaged. So far, so good. However, the cultural differences between her family and his are significant. Adjustments and accommodations are necessary and often hilarious as the wedding day approaches. The film's ending is not merely happy, it is joyous. Refreshingly is the fact that in this film, there is a total absence of cynicism concerning ethnic differences. They are relevant to the story line and revealed with good humor. Those who enjoy this film are urged to check out Moonstruck (1987) and Return to Me (2000) in which ethnic and cultural values are also celebrated with style, grace, and exuberance.</p></body></html>

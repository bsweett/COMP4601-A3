Well, with Lord Of War it becomes a first hand experience.  Lord Of War is a film about a guy who is one of the hottest arms dealers around. Yuri (Cage) tries to find his calling in life, and he stumbles into international arms dealing.  What the entire movie basically talks about is if it's moral, and when I say "talk" I do mean it.  The entire movie is narrated by Nic Cage's character, every thought and every action. Each scene is layed out by narration and then wrapped up with narration. It gets to a point where you feel like yelling at the writer and tell him "to shut that goddamn inner monologue off". What seperates a film from a book is that the action is performed in a film rather than described. People call this film an "action/adventure", but I find no justification for this to be placed in that genre. The only thing this movie has going for it is that there are some interesting ideas being thrown around. Unfortunetly all those ideas don't make an impact because the audience becomes so bored with the film. In terms of cinematic achievments, there are a few well done scenes.  A scene involving Nicolas Cage and Ian Holm was pretty tense, and so is a scene that shows Nicolas Cage going through some hallucinations. The opening credits were  brilliant in my opinion, but then again I couldn't wait to see the closing credits.  The relationship between Cage and his wife was also pretty bad. Basically she married Yuri for the money, and then she gets angry with him when she finds out what he actually does and that he had been decieving her. Talk about true love. The movie never finds its direction, and that makes the audience suffer for two hours. It had some nifty camera work and cinematography, but the satirical points the movie was trying to make was lost due to poor pacing and no direction within the plot.<br /><br />ACTING: Nothing stellar, we've all seen what these actors can do and they don't do much more than that here.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Not very enjoyable, you may get a chuckle or a smile from a witty line a few times throughout, but all the 3rd person narration will bore you to tears.</p></body></html>

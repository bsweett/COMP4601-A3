There is a lot of breath taking wide shots of meticulously created seaside and mountain top scenes. It takes you on a virtual ride on the back of a dragon and the film is a thrill ride in more ways than one.<br /><br />The story centers around a youth called Hiccup (Jay Baruchel also of Sorcerer's Apprentice) who is an under-achiever as far as the ways of the Vikings go. Unlike his father Stoick the Vast (Gerard Butler also of The Ugly Truth) who is a much accomplished fighter and dragon killer, Hiccup is more of a brains than brawn type of guy.<br /><br />With his technical skills his is able to construct a device that is able to capture the mysterious Night Fury dragon (that no-one have ever been able to capture or kill). However, the device damages the dragon's tail, and he is no longer able to fly properly. Hiccup soon constructs an artificial tail piece for the dragon, and then he also makes a harness for the dragon and learns to ride it.<br /><br />Each time he goes for a ride on the dragon, it is like a surreal adventure in the skies. The adventure element of this film is pretty high, but there is also a lot of action sequences as the story develops.<br /><br />The voice acting is superb, and Jay's voice of uncertainty/frustration adds depth to his character and conveys his odd situations quite well, Gerard also does a very good job.<br /><br />The underlying message of this movie is not to judge anyone too quickly without knowing the full circumstances under which they are making their decisions.</p></body></html>

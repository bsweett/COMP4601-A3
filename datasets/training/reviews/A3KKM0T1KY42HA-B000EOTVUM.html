<meta name="summary" content="Just Out For A Drive In The Country"></head><body><p>You're an everyday kind of guy. You like to have fun. Party. You make impulse decisions and impulse purchases. And one day you make an impulse decision with two of your female friends to buy a cheap car and take a road trip across the desolate Outback to the Wolf Creek meteor crater.<br /><br />It's fun. The country is beautiful. One of your friends has a crush on you and you have one on her. You get to Wolf Creek Park and have to hike out to the meteor crater.<br /><br />The meteor crater is awesome. You hit it off very nicely with the gal who has a crush on you, and she will probably be your girlfriend after today.<br /><br />Everything is going great until you hike back to your car from the crater and your new used car won't start.<br /><br />In Australia 30,000 people are reported missing every year, and of those 90% are found. The movie Wolf Creek is about the folks in my scenario above. And the folks in my scenario are players in a story of what perhaps the fate is of some of the 10% that are not found.<br /><br />Wolf Creek is one of the better Horror flicks that I've seen in a while. It is not a gore fest. It is not a jump out of the dark scare 'em up. It is not a slasher movie. Wolf Creek is a suspenseful thriller that gives the viewer a realistic fly-on-the-wall perspective of the perilous fate of a few everyday people that run into a very bad situation.<br /><br />Kudos to the cast...the acting is absolutely superb. Very believable. Too many times in Horror movies you find a cast of teeny boppers overacting and just acting foolishly. Wolf Creek is the antithesis of teeny bopper Horror. Wolf Creek's 3 young adult actors capture the young adult viewer with dispositions that can easily be related to, and they check all campy Horror movie humor and cliches at the door.<br /><br />This movie is done very well, and it is truly scary, because none of our party is faced with a guy in a mask, or a guy with a claw hand, or a supernatural being of some kind. They are instead faced with that stranger you passed on the highway just the other day. They are faced with some Outback nut that really could be out there.<br /><br />Thinking of a nice drive in the country anytime soon? I'd watch Wolf Creek after that trip if you want to enjoy your drive.</p></body></html>

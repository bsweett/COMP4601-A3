If you merely want to watch a feel-good film, I strongly urge you to avoid this dvd. On the other hand, if you are eager to think a little bit more, and don't mind a sometimes acerbic sense of humour, this is the right movie for you.<br /><br />The main character is Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), a lobbyist and spokesman for the American tobacco industry that is a master of media spinning and doublespeak, and that is glad of having "a moral flexibility that goes beyond most people". Nick has a son, Joey, and thus has to try to be a role model to him, despite his polemic job. That is specially difficult after a beautiful reporter (Katie Holmes) with whom he had an affair betrays his trust, writing a tell-all article about him.<br /><br />It is pretty interesting to watch Nick as he twists logic in order to defend the right of everybody to smoke, saying that has to do with freedom of choice. In his words, "that's the beauty of arguing, because if you argue correctly you are never wrong". This film has fictional characters, but is also based on some real facts, something that makes it specially interesting. From my point of view, "Thank you for smoking" is a caustic and ironic film, but also a must see for everybody that is interested in the power of words.

<meta name="summary" content="THE EXORCIST AS HISTORY"></head><body><p>When America's favorite paperback of recent times, &quot;The Exorcist&quot; premiered as a movie in 1973, it was carnival time in theatre lobbys and Hollywood corporate headquarters. The film took in big profits and patrons were behaving as if they too were possessed by the devil. Long lines waited to see swirling heads, defrocked priests and a little girl who was no Shirley Temple. People freaked, ran from the theatre, got sick. The news press reported of ambulances arriving at theatres to escort ill patrons to the hospital. I remember many a cold night standing in the snow waiting to get another look at this ... show. When those lobby doors closed it was like being trapped in a cage with a ferocious animal. The chaos on the screen was only matched by the chaos in the theatre where people alternately laughed and genuinely screamed at the ridicolous horror, sometimes in the same breath uncontrolably.  As kids, we couldn't get enough of it. I must had seen it five times in it's premier week, every show a packed house of 'Rocky Horror' responses that were never planned. &quot;The Exorcist&quot; was the tabloid 'catch phrase' of the day. It seems every church group in America was protesting the movie. There was talk that the story was based on the demonic possession of a Hollywood celebrity's child, we all knew who and we all believed it! We were told the real Catholic priests who played themselves in the movie were being ex-communicated from The Catholic Church, and yes, it's true, the Catholic Church rarely performs exorcisms. It was a glorious media ... circus and it retains that manipulative capitalist soul sucking spirit today. And to some of us it remains very dear. You see, the youth in 1973 could point up to the screen to a puke discharging, head spinning, foul-mouthed little girl with a fondness for crucifixes and say, &quot;You know, some days I feel like that.&quot;</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Inspired by a true story - AND by the strange need to ruin a classic"></head><body><p>The movie is well-made, especially with the relatively low budget utilized in making it - but I feel it falls short creatively.  The original was gritty and real - this was not.  This movie had a Hollywood feel to me.  I will stop the comparisons to the original movie, as they are in two completely different leagues.<br /><br />This movie just wasn't scary.  It wasn't disturbing or unsettling.  The only thing they were able to maintain throughout was a feeling of mild suspense.  There was just enough gore to keep fans of the genre happy - and it was well done - not too much, not too little.  I was hoping to be disturbed after seeing it, yet I was let down substantially.<br /><br />The bonus DVD and materials, however, are quite impressive.  There is a lengthy documentary on the making of the movie, deleted scenes and even a documentary on Ed Gein, the psychopathic killer the original movie was loosely based on.  The bonus material is actually more entertaining than the film.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you'll have to watch this movie - but don't expect the raw terror of the first movie.</p></body></html>

However, since so much of this movie depends on the tension created by Bardem's terrifying, toying deliberation, you might be a little disappointed by what seems to be some unwarranted hastening of the action in certain places. It feels as if a number of scenes were left on the cutting room floor - scenes that we want to see, that we are primed to see by the overall pacing of the movie.<br /><br />For example, there is the scene that was so often used to advertise this movie - the scene in which Bardem's character engages a convenience storeowner in what we clearly perceive is a life-or-death coin toss. When Bardem mockingly calls the storeowner "Friendo" and commands him to call heads or tails, we feel that something in particular triggered Bardem's animosity, that the storeowner himself might have presumptively addressed Bardem as "Friendo." However we don't see any of what might have led to the showdown. The scene is pretty much limited to just the action shown in the advertising trailer.<br /><br />If one of the reasons we watch thrillers, outside of pure vicarious enjoyment of violence, is to rehearse what we ourselves might do if confronted by extreme threats - then it's important to see the whole development of the threat.<br /><br />One other quibble: the plot's logic fails on a key point. Bardem's character proves to be such an implacable, unerring juggernaut in tracking down whoever stole his drug consignment, we wonder how he so easily lost track of the drug package in the first place.<br /><br />However these minor points aside, "No Country" is an absolutely engrossing trip - taken once. When I went to watch it through a second time though, I found I wasn't nearly as involved. I did appreciate having another chance to get to know Tommy Lee Jones' character, with his wonderful, heroic resign. But Bardem's Chigurh character didn't seem as interesting the second time around. Whereas I can watch other Coen Brother's classics such as "Fargo" and "Blood Simple" any number of times and always find some new fascination with them - this movie didn't seem complex enough to hold up that way.<br /><br />In summary, this is a great movie to rent, but it might not be worth adding to your permanent collection.</p></body></html>

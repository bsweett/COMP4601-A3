<meta name="summary" content="A view from the non-gamer side"></head><body><p>I have to confess that I don't play video games - eye-hand coordination and lightning reflexes weren't included in my genetic package, so this review is based on the movie - and nothing but the movie.<br /><br />Other than Milla Jovovich, no cast member did any real acting.  Michelle Rodriguez had a fairly difficult role to play, but the snarling and eye rolling was just too much at times.  She was necessarily tough, but the dialogue also really let her down. The rest of the cast was on par for a B Grade horror movie, and only slightly more animated than the zombies.<br /><br />This movie is what happens when you mix too many good things in a haphazard way. Imagine trying to write a coherent script when your "must" list includes zombies, were-dogs, sloppy genetic mutations with long tongues, a controlling computer system, an impregnable "fortress", a knockout babe with amnesia, a SWAT team, biological warfare, viruses, spies and saboteurs, a battle on a train, and guns - lots of guns.<br /><br />The zombie scenes failed to impress, no gore to be seen anywhere - they just looked like a typical crowd of people in the mosh pit at a rock concert.  The mutating tissue-thing was straight out of a Dean Koontz book, and most of the suspense scenes weren't very suspenseful, because whatever you expected to happen - did.<br /><br />On the cool side, you had the wicked lasers to do the slicing and dicing, Alice's (Milla) hot red zombie-kicking slit-way-up the side dress, and the fight scenes.  Many parts may seem familiar, mainly because you've seen scenes just like them in other popular action movies.<br /><br />Next time let Alice do some Mortal Kombat with Lara Croft and you can call it a Final Fantasy.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, February 22, 2005</p></body></html>

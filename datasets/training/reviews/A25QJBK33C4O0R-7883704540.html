Apparently the great minds at Pixar/Disney that's who!<br />This is a beautiful film.  Hands down one of the most impressive examples of video quality you can find.  Reference quality.  Demo quality.  (As in used to demonstrate high-def equipment to help sell it to customers in big box stores, appliance and electronic areas in department stores, etc.)<br />The color pops, the graphics are so stunning and impressive that words escape me for adequately praising the movie and the results obtained in watching this disc.  Just absolutely great work by Pixar/Disney on the Blu-ray version of this film.<br />The movie itself is unbelievably good also.  I'm not a fan of Patton Oswalt.  I find his voice to be grating and irritating to me, and yet he fits the role he plays here perfectly and doesn't irritate at all.  While I originally assumed that I'd find the thought of a rat chef disgusting, the story is great and so entertaining that you go past all of that in mere seconds of watching the movie.<br />Add this great movie to your collection now.  Don't hestitate!</p></body></html>

The humor was always prevalent, and I will always like the first 2 of that original series. Fortunately, for the movie-going public at large, the very smart, very brilliant Bryan Singer came up with a new, darker take on the series...though a very indvidual accomplishment. The 2-disc version is quite fine, with great insights on the casting, and various other elements that went into this filmmaking endeavor. Mr. Singer is ever-present in these many extras, providing humorous and fun stuff. The film, itself, is quite fine. I saw it in a theatre before I bought this set. Brandon Routh is certainly the best looking, most handsome Superman ever on film. It's unfortunate that Mr. Singer kept him brooding and serious most of the time; that smile could melt anyone. Kate Bosworth was a terrific Lois, and I  may be the first to say the Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olson was great! Indeed, he made Clark's return seem exciting and interesting. James Marsden also was fine in what must have been a difficult role. Then there's Mr. Routh, never missing a trick, always in command. The absolute best thing about this film, in my opinion, is that there's the nastiest of Lex Luthor portrayals by Kevin Spacey, truly the way it should be. The meanness was uncompromised, and it was the most powerful performance in the film. Also, I've also been a fan of Parker Posey, especially in  Christopher Guest's improvisational films. She is very fine here, too, being the foil to Spacey's maniac tirades. I also very much liked the reference to John Williams' original score, and the love theme, "Can You Read My Mind" (which was NOT nominated for an Oscar in '78, but is one of the most remembered themes in film). With all due respect to the two Donner films, I really enjoyed Bryan Singer's addition to the Superman legacy...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mesmerising"></head><body><p>A film drenched in atmosphere, a unique story, wonderful villains, great sets and solid acting: a superb film.<br /><br />Imagine waking up in a bathrub not knowing who you are, why there's a dead woman in the adjacent room, or why mysterious people are chasing you.  Such is the dilemma faced by the protagonist in the opening of Dark City.  However, this plot thread is only the beginning of Dark City.  Aliens with the power to control everything and everyone, a mysterious scientist who talks in gasps, a solemn detective who begins to realize he doesn't know what's going on, a seemingly-schizophreniac detective who knows exactly what's going on, a beautiful woman caught in the middle of everything, the never-ending darkness, and the realization that perhaps what seems real is anything but.<br /><br />A beautiful film, brought down only by a rediculously out-of-place action sequence.  8.5/10</p></body></html>

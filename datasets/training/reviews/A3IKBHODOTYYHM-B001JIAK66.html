For those who actually like a story with all those special effects, this movie did not deliver.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie, but it had no creativity to it. It seems as though the action, fantasy and horror movies have become so dependent on special effects that they actually can try to get by with little else, devoid of a good story or creepy characters. None of these characters were very impressive, and had little in the way of script to get themselves out of their proverbial holes. As one reviewer mentioned, Dracula came across as wimpy and annoying more than anything else. Personally, I didn't care what happened after about an hour and a half of viewing. I just wanted it to end.<br /><br />Perhaps a cynical viewpoint to express, but I'm sick of watching a movie and seeing nothing but special effects. This one is not much a movie mainly because it lacks what even the cheesy horror movies of the past had:  personality.<br /><br />None here.</p></body></html>

However, the misfit Mumble cannot sing, but instead has an extraordinary talent to tap dance with almost magical energy and expression. Nevertheless, the deeply conformist leadership of the colony fearfully blames the young penguin's unorthodox ways for the lean fishing that threatens them all. Defiant in the face of unjust rejection, Mumble and his true friends set out to find the true cause of the famine. Through the motley crew's trials and perils, Mumble learns many things about his frozen world, not the least of which being that his toe tapping talent may be what he needs to save his people. This movie is a feel-good animated movie that works on a few different levels; it will make you laugh, cry, and make you tap your toes or bounce your leg. Happy Feet makes your heart soar from start to finish. This movie is definitely worth watching with your kids.</p></body></html>

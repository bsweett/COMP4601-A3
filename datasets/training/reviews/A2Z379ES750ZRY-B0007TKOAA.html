Not only is Sandra Oh the only "visible" minority in this movie, she is the only character given a minor role.  The role of Oh's character as the asian sex freak is simply used to offset the "deep" character developoment of the other three major characters.  The Sandra Oh role should have been the Virginia Madsen character -- but then again Hollywood seems to be bent on maintaining certain stereotypes.</p></body></html>

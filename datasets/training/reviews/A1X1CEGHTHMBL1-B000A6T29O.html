<meta name="summary" content="An entertaining high action thriller!"></head><body><p>I watch movies to be entertained for 2 hours or so.  This movie fulfilled that requirement.  Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) is a tomb raider extraordinaire.  She is the female version of Indiana Jones but with acrobatic skills, fighting skills, brains and looks.<br /><br />She is trying to steal a diamond from a chamber of an Egyptian tomb and she is attacked by a robot.  A fight and chase occurs and Lara defeats the robot and takes the treasure to find out it is a tape of her favorite music.  This action takes place in her home and it is her way of keeping her skills sharp for the real thing.  Unfortunately she doesn't suspect that the real adventure will be even more dangerous and deadly than the practice session could ever be....<br /><br />Angelina Jolie does a superb job in playing this role.  Her acting skills and athletic ability shine in this movie.  It is almost nonstop action and adventure all over the world with Lara being the focus of the movie.<br /><br />Yeah the movie is over the top and silly at times but the premise of the movie is a video game.  Despite Angelina's excellent performance, the storyline and the some parts of the movie didn't measure up to the same high standard.  But I enjoyed it for what it was, entertaining and fun to watch.  I think you will like it also!</p></body></html>

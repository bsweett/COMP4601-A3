<meta name="summary" content="The Longest Yard"></head><body><p>Paul "wrecking" Crewe (Sandler) is a former NFL star quarterback that left the league in scandal after being caught point shaving.  He has been down on himself ever since, and after a drunken car chase, he finds himself in prison with a chance at redemption.  He has been "recruited" by Warden Hazen (Cromwell) to coach the prison guard's team.  This leads to him putting together a team on inmates to scrimmage against the guards before their season starts to give them confidence.  Of course, along the way the Crewe and the inmates start to show the desire and ability to win.  The game will be a free-for-all, guards against inmates on national television.<br /><br />"The Longest Yard" is a remake of the movie of the same name from 1974.  Having not seen the original, I cannot make a comparison.  I have a feeling that this one packs a few more laughs with the likes of Sandler and Rock in the cast.  Burt Reynolds (who was also in the original) rounds out the cast of inmates.  Full of football action and laughs, "The Longest Yard" succeeds at what it sets out to do.  This is not a great movie, but it is an entertaining way to spend a few hours.</p></body></html>

His prison is basically like a rundown apartment complete with bathroom, a bed and a TV as one of his only link to the outside world besides talking to the jailer, he gets fed 3 times a day including with water and would sometimes get a haircut but during those years he builds up so when the time comes he can take care of someone his own way. Now in 2003 after 15 years he is finally free out on the streets of Seoul as he is given new clothes, cash and a cellphone. He sees the city has changed over the years, he finds romance with a Japanese chef named Mido and now must find the crooks who tormented him and imprisoned him for those years.<br /><br />A most excellent crime thriller and one of the best comic based movies ever. From Korean director Park Chanwook, this movie is loosely based on a popular Japanese manga or Japanese comic book, this movie is a poetic and very violent revenge movie about what it feels to be aged and being away from the world for a long time. There's a Taratino-esque quality to it that he even approve of this movie as being one of his favorite movies ever and now it has became a cult classic that even thrilled critics. This movie is brutally violent at times with a couple of torture scenes like the cringe inducing dental job with a hammer-back scene to good acting. This complex work of art is one that entertains and thrills the viewer to the edge of their seats to the mind blowing ending.<br /><br />The blu-ray has a nice transfer with good sound with great extras like 3 commentaries in subtitles with your choice of Korean with english subs or English dubbing. Trailers, deleted scenes with optional commentary and a second disc with 5 documentaries, interviews and featurettes.<br /><br />A must have for fans of crime, action, comic book movies and cinema alike.</p></body></html>

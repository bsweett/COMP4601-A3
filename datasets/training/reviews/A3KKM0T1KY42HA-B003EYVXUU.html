Wow...Reeves goes from a shaky camera to a steady hand at a solid film! Let Me In is the best vampire movie that I've seen in a very, very long time.<br /><br />Granted, Reeves didn't have much work to do other than transpose what was already done in Sweeden in 2008 by Director Tomas Alfredson with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MYIXAW">Let the Right One In</a>. Let Me In is basically a redo of the former albeit Americanized. But unless a redo is done "Right", it can easily flop. But flop Let Me In does not with some class acting by kid actors Chlo? Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee.<br /><br />And they call it...puppy love. A bullied recluse of a boy with a single parent goes gaga when a young girl moves into his neighborhood seemingly with the same reclusive traits and a single parent. But when the girl turns out to be a vampire (oh, am I really giving anything away there to anyone reading this?), does it freak him out or draw him in?<br /><br />A vampire that does not have human "familiars"--people who assist vampires by night and more importantly watch over the vampire "nest" by day--is at great risk to being hunted and killed while the sun shines. Dracula's Renfield was a familiar but not referred to as one in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199564094">the novel</a>. In fact, I can think only of two modern day Hollywood creations that use the term familiar, those being the excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HFWAYU">Blade Collection</a> of films and the TV series <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ECQ4AS">Supernatural</a>.<br /><br />Let Me In is a terrific tale that intertwines a love story, everyday childhood bullying, vampires and their "familiar" relationships. It's one of the most unique takes on the genre that I've ever seen; it is done with gruesomeness, grace and compassion. Move Let Me In to your Cart and add it to your collection. Great movie.</p></body></html>

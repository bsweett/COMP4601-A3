After seeing the second one I realize I was wrong.  Alfred Molina's performance is great, as are all of the other actors.  Sam Raimi once again has made an amazing movie,  instead of not expanding the characters and focusing on all action he focuses on the characters and makes great action scenes.  Imagine if the series keeps getting better.  Spiderman 6 should be the best movie ever made.  Somehow though this is better than the first one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Best of the Trilogy by far!"></head><body><p>Die Hard is a great action movie and also the best of the trilogy. It has more heart and emotion than the sequels. Bruce Willis plays a N.Y cop who goes to L.A. for a christmas party at his wife's work building. Soon after getting there, everyone gets heald captive by terrorists who want money that is inside the building. He finds that he's the only hope for all the hostages inside since he's the only one not being heald by them.<br /><br />  After  killing some of the bad guys by himself he manages to befriend a cop outside the building "well played by Family Matters'  Reginald VelJohnson". They contact each other back and forth by walkie talkie with Willis letting him know what's going on inside the building. The relationship between Willis and VelJohnson adds a nice human touch to the film. They manage to have good chemestry without actually talking face to face throughout the movie.<br /><br />  VelJohnson says he never used his gun since he accidently shot a kid. Which leads to me always getting teared up when he actually uses his gun again at the end. It's a very emotional and powerful and under-rated scene. That scene alone makes me question how Roger Ebert could give this film 2 stars but part 2 ***1/2 and part 3 ***. Samual L. Jackson's scene with Willis in part 3 has nothing on Willis' with Reginald VelJohnson. VelJohnson is so good here that it makes me wish that he didn't get wasted on Family Matters for years as just that fat guy Steve Urcle pissed off all the time lol. Plus to throw in there, Alan Rickman gives one of the best slimy villian performances in the history of film. You can go rent some crappy action film of today with bad acting and bad writing but you're better off just watching Die Hard on cable.</p></body></html>

Terminator 3 proves to be a weak movie because it had a weak story and it betrayed the original concept. After Terminator 2, the story should have basically ended, if not what was the purpose of that movie? If Judgment Day cannot be stop, only delayed, Skynet could have sent terminator after terminator to the past. The entire logic of the science fiction story would fall apart.<p>Second, this new bad terminator simply wasn't as powerful or nasty as the one in the second movie. Pretty girl but she bite the bullet pretty easily. Second, the director don't have James Cameron's touch for action and story telling all at the same time. He can only do one thing at a time and its showed.<p>Bad film editing in the movie. After all, how did that RV crew managed to get into the top secret Skynet Center just at the same time as the bad terminator got in. At least the bad terminator can disguised herself as anyone, how can John Conner and his buddies get in that easily of entrance??<p>If this was a stand alone movie, it would have been more enjoyable but as part of the series, it definitely fail to deliever and while everything about the film was technically well done, it totally failed in the most important aspect of any science fiction movie, the story!!</p></body></html>

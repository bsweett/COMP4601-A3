<meta name="summary" content="Cronenberg and Mortensen's best"></head><body><p>David Cronenberg has always been an edgy, disturbing director - and many of his films are difficult to watch.  Eastern Promises is probably his most accessible film.  There's something old world about this - no fancy turns - just plain old fashioned filmmaking and great acting.  This is why the film succeeds.  I can't praise the ensemble and script enough.  This is definitely Viggo Mortensen's best role.  He's a compelling actor.  Vincent Cassel, who's always good, really finds his groove.  As does Armin Mueller Stahl and of course Naomi Watts.  The interplay and nuances of Eastern Promises makes it more Shakespearan and Godfather-like than a "thriller" as it's advertised.  It's a thriller played out as a streetsmart chess game.</p></body></html>

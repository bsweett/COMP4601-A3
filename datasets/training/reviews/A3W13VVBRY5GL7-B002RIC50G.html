I won't synopsise the plot because several key events occur very early on in the movie - suffice it to say that the boy Lecter has his humanity removed by exposure to several inhuman characters, as well as the death of his family, during WWII Lithuania. Subsequently, the introverted and silent Lecter is taken in by his beautiful Japanese Aunt and, as the body count begins to multiply, Hannibal comes out of his shell and becomes more and more the character we remember from "Silence of the Lambs".<br /><br />This isn't a great movie. Mind you, it's not a bad one, either, not at all - Gong Li and Rhys Ifans give solid supporting performances to Gaspard Ulliel's confident, dynamic reading of Lecter, and Peter Webber's direction, while neither memorable nor original, is at least competent. Production design is duly lush, and the script is also reasonably sound. But the overall feeling you're left with at the end of the picture is that of Yet Another Blockbuster, and nothing at all like a study of the twisted psyche of a cannibalistic murderer.<br /><br />Possible Spolier Alert: Several of the elements of Hannibal's past are overblown and campy, not least the flashback scenes involving the Lithuanian militia and Lecter's sister Mischa. Far from a proposed sense of the inhuman, the bawdy antics of the group of soldiers recall Monty Python in a very undramatic way. There's nothing here we haven't seen before.<br /><br />Similarly, the heritage of Hannibal's Japanese Aunt feels slightly overconvenient and tacked-on, when, for his first murder, Lecter "borrows" the Samurai mask of her ancestors, providing a visual link to the most terrifying image of Hopkins' Lecter. But since that wasn't a choice on the part of the Hopkins character, why use it here? Like much of the film (the Lara Croft-style leather & motorcycle antics of Gong Li, samurai training montages in post-WW II France, exploding barges that belong in James Bond, and so forth), this image rings false, and Gaspard Ulliel's essentially sound portrayal of the young Hannibal Lecter is overdressed and dumbed-down because of this.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you haven't seen or read any of the other movies or novels in this series, this might be a good place to start: it's a lightweight, blockbustery sort of film, very flawed, but containing several decent elements of cast and production that save it from being a plain old bad movie. "Hannibal Rising" fails when it is played for cheap thrills - had the same movie been made with the same people and toned-down, it could have been a classic.<br /><br />Take that as you will.</p></body></html>

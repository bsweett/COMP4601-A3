<meta name="summary" content="Compelling War Drama. Mel Gibson In One Of His Best Performances (Has He Ever Done A Bad Job Acting? Nyet)"></head><body><p>The Extended Cut of this war picture starring Mel "Martin Riggs" Gibson and a pre-Joker Heath Ledger has 10 minutes of scenes previously deleted from the film re-inserted into the movie. I can't remember any of the differences between the theatrical edition (available as the Special Edition DVD) and this cut of the film, save for one shot that clears up a continuity error. The performances from everyone are top-notch, especially Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger, Lisa Brenner, Jason Isaacs and Tom Wilkinson. Great movie. Unrated, but contains graphic violence.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Georgia On My Mind." Ray Charles. The Man. The Music. The Legend."></head><body><p>The Oscar-winning bio-drama on Ray Charles, who died in June, 2004, shortly before the film's release is an absolute work of art, highlighted by an Academy-Award winning performance by Jamie Foxx ("Collateral") as "The Innovator Of Soul, Ray Charles." The film centers on Ray from the mid-1940's to 1971, interspersed with flashbacks of his childhood, not attempting to sanitize Ray's life. Taylor Hackford ("La Bamba") is very meticulous in depicting the era covered in the film. The production values are excellent. GREAT performances from the entire cast, especially Mr. Foxx.<br /><br />The DVD edition features two versions of this heartwarming biography: the theatrical cut and the Extended Edition, featuring 14 additional scenes not shown in theaters. Rated PG for thematic elements, depictions of drug addiction and some language.</p></body></html>

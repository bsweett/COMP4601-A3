More often than not, the new ones, in this day and age, don't measure up. I am happy to say that this movie, while it doesn't exactly succeed, comes closer than anything in recent memory. Directed by actor Jon Favreau("Swingers"), "Elf" is a slight and silly piece of cutesy fluff that should entertain everyone, from most any age group, to the very end. Former SNL cast member Will Ferrel, who can do no wrong in my humble opinion, plays Buddy The Elf, but he is no ordinary elf. Many years ago, while Santa(played by Ed Asner), visited an orphange, a little baby crawled into Santa's sack, without the big guy knowing, and ended up in the North Pole. Instead of taking him back, they named him Buddy(after his diapers), and Papa Elf(Played by the always wonderful Bob Newhart), decided to adopt the infant and raise him as his own. And as an elf. Flash forward 30 years, and the gigantic, human sized Buddy finds out he is human and sets out to find his real father, who he learns is a publisher named William Hobbs, and lives in a far away land known as "New York City". Buddy meets up with Hobbs(James Caan)and his family, while adjusting to big city life. In the process, he meets the lovely Jove(Played by the adorable Zooey Deschanell), and tries to find his place in the world and to open the eyes of his father. It's pretty standard in the plot area, but it is decently written and structured, and Buddy is such a charming and loveable oaf, that you watch every second he's on screen. The movie, surprisingly, isn't as wackily funny as one would expect from Ferrell and the nature of the material. It's funny, but has a sense of romance and nostalgia that kinda makes it seem like those oh-so-warmy made for lifetime Christmas movies. But better. The supporting cast also includes Mary Steenburgen as Caan's wife, and an uncredited Michael Lerner. The movie is cute and digestable, and it has that oh so important holiday message of opening your eyes and seeing what you got and embrace it. We've seen it a million times, but it never fails to resonate or matter if it's done well. And it's done pretty well here. Ferrell is a commanding presence, that's for sure, and he makes the most of the silly situations. Caan is his usually serious, solid self, and Deschanell, who usually does more independent type movies, is a delight. And what a nice voice she has!. Asner is a good Santa, and I believe I have seen him in the role somewhere else as well. I have always loved Bob Newhart, and it was nice to see him in a big film. I just wished there was more of him. A great soundtrack filled with holiday favorites and other nice little nuggets pepper the film. The look of the film is pretty nice as well. Nothing beats New York at Christmas time. The design of the North Pole is hilarious, as it reminds us of those old 60's and 70's TV specials we all grew up on. The animated critters and a walking and talking snowman(voiced by the mysterious singer Leon Redbone, who also contributed to the soundtrack), also give those nostalgic little touches. The DVD extras are also a nice batch of goodies. I especially like the 10 minute section on people who really decorate big time for the holiday, and a section on Christmas in Hollywood. There is lots more here, and they are all fun and entertaining for a pretty fun, entertaining, and ultimately harmless little movie. Merry Christmas!.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Most Fun You'll Have at the Movies This Year"></head><body><p>If you initially thought (thanks to the trailers having to be approved for all audiences) that Kick-ass would be a potential Razzie-award winning spoof on the same level as Disaster Movie, Dance Flick, Meet the Spartans, and just about every *insert type of movie here* movie that is released nowdays (one word for those cinematic _____mongers: UGH), don't feel bad if you did.  I did too.  When I first saw the trailer for Kick-ass, my mind went along the lines of "why does the movie industry keep making these spoof movies!".  I really did think the movie would be another lame spoof movie or a half-@$$ed superhero comedy for children.<br /><br />Instead, what I got was a endlessly entertaining (the movie took no time to ramp up), violent, foul-mouthed comic joyride, both making fun of comic books and at the same time being a serious superhero movie (albeit with a zany Red Bull bend). I admit that it took me the R-Rating and an uncensored preview when realizing what it really was: A violent, often hilarious, and almost Tarantino-ish superhero flick, both serious, funny, and gloriously over the-top.  So much for first impressions.  It's much more than that, and It's certainly the movie I've been waiting for this year, considering how dire the year of 2010 has been for films (the new Scorsese movie was a two and a half hour rejected Twilight Zone episode, at best).<br /><br />A comparison that is already swirling around is a mixture of Spider-man and Kill Bill, and as my namesake probably suggests, it appeared to my Tarantino senses and delivered some thrilling action sequences.  The action is stylized in a way that would make the man himself very proud.  Most funny are the riffs on comic books, such as Dave's first attack that surely shows him why many people don't don costumes in the first place.  However, if you are a fan of superhero films, comic books, and take them seriously, don't worry, Kick-Ass doesn't spit on your past time, either.  Despite some of the satirical jokes regarding comic books in general, Kick-Ass is still a genuine superhero film at heart.  Kick-ass doesn't turn into a cynical satire with a "Superheroes are totally fake and your an idiot for getting into them" message.  The superheros are also internally motivated (Big Daddy and Hitgirl are both victims of murder), which helps the film seem more like a real superhero film, than just a satire on the world of comics.<br /><br />I'm sure Kick-Ass might get some criticism as being a movie that has nothing to offer besides shock-value.  As far as shock value goes, I wouldn't quite go for that, especially if you've seen such movies as Cannibal Holocaust, but this movie doesn't need shock value (ask Tom Green).  You'll laugh when it's funny, and be energized by the violence of the movie, not shocked by it.  That's the reason why it's great, it's more than just shock value, it's pure fun, like the rollercoaster type of feeling.  When we ride rollercoasters, we don't think of the negative emotions and how tough we will look, we think of how much pure fun were having.  That's how the R worthy content in this movie should be approached.<br /><br />Some of the humor falls flat, as I found some (SOME, people) of the raunchy humor to be kind of hackneyed, such as the scene in the beginning regarding self-stimulation.  It wasn't like Superbad, where most of the raunchy jokes were laugh out loud hilarious and quite creative, at least in my opinion.  They were thought out, not their for some cheap laughs.  Thankfully, these kind of jokes are kept to a minimum with great use of timing and swearing in the dialogue.  As you probably have heard by now, the 11 year old (at the time) Chloe Moertz steals the show here, as the violent 11 year old teenage girl with the mouth of a sailor and the maturity of a person much older than her age.  Another funny performance, well performances, I found were the mobsters, as their foul-mouthed, deliberately crude dialogue got a lot of laughs from me.  Lot's of the situations are funny as well, as I found the scene where they put the man in the trash compactor to be darkly hilarious.<br /><br />I for one am not a great fan of Superhero movies (some people really love them and get into the backstories and characters much more than I do.  They really do treat them like Greek Mythology), but I do enjoy them and I must say that Kick-Ass is one of the most enjoyable superhero films I've seen, much more than movies like X-men or Superman Returns (though I list those for personal preferences, I have nothing wrong with those movies).  You'll get your money worth, and you'll have a Kick-ass time (sorry).  This movie is sure to become a cult classic someday, and like most cult movies, it will hit home for the right kind of viewer.  Either way, don't miss Kick-Ass.</p></body></html>

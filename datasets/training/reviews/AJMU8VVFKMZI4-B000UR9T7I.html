Friends warned me that this film didn't exactly hold up to expectations, which is probably why I'm watching it a year later and, unfortunately, I have to agree with them.  My complaint is the same as others-too many villains, choppy character development and abrupt plot changes.  One scene Peter is begging for MJ to call him and literally 2 minutes later MJ is asking why he isn't returning HER calls.  Short memory loss, timely butler confessions and just flat out slow pacing-which is the death toll for an action flick.  Honestly, I think they need to stop here, disappear for about a decade and let another generation get a crack at it.  There's just no where to go from here.  There are already too many scenes that give a sense of deja vu.  I've never known so many people plummeting out buildings like they do in this franchise.  I'm not a New Yorker, but I doubt such a problem exists.  Overall, if you're a die hard fan, check it out.  If not, skip it.</p></body></html>

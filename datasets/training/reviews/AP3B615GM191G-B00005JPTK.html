<meta name="summary" content="No Resolution, But Still A Decent Film"></head><body><p>As I viewed this film, it quickly become clear to me that two very different themes are being explored by director Francis Lawrence in this film, one that works and one that does not:<br /><br />The first, more wide-reaching theme, is the fate of the human race, which Robert Neville (Will Smith) is working desperately to save throughout the movie.  I can't tell you the state of humanity at the end of the film without spoiling some things, but suffice it to say that there is a good chance you will feel a bit let down by the lack of resolution to this theme.<br /><br />The theme that works quite well, however, is how Neville copes with being the "last man on Earth".  His internal struggles and outward devices (such as talking to mannequins, for instance) that he uses to keep some semblance of his sanity are intriguing, and Smith is a well-rounded enough actor to portray the wide variety of emotions his character must express.<br /><br />Overall, then, this is a decent enough film (worth a rent), but lacks enough of a payoff in the end to be considered a real classic.  I found this film to be much in the vein of J.J. Abram's recent hit "Cloverfield", where little to nothing is explained or expanded on...viewers are just supposed to live in the moment.  Yet, with the way that Neville's family is developed in this film (unlike the anonymous characters of Cloverfield), I think that the lack of a conclusive ending was more apparent.</p></body></html>

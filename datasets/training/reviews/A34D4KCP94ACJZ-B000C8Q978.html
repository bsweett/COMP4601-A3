<meta name="summary" content="May be Jarmusch's Most Accessible Film Yet"></head><body><p>Broken Flowers is about a lonely retired former womanizer played by Bill Murray.  His name is Don Johnston, a "Don Juan" if you will, who receives a random letter in the mail from an unnamed former girlfriend.  The letter indicates that Don has a son who has just begun a trip to search for his father.  Don seems somewhat indifferent to the news but given the theme of the film it's likely that he is more tired of life and perhaps a bit self-absorbed than actual indifference, as this news is something that will eventually serve to re-awaken Don and perhaps it gives him just the self-interest he needs to live life with renewed vigor.  In that sense, the story of Don is an existential tale more so than one with a conventional end.  The film offers us means to complete a nice story of a father's union with his son that he's never met.  But director Jim Jarmusch is not conventional and he is too smart to throw such a trivial narrative our way.<br /><br />At the suggestion and great enthusiasm of his friend and neighbor Winston, Don is convinced that the search for this former girlfriend and the mother of his son is a worthy undertaking.  So he goes off to find five of his former girlfriends at the time his son would've been born (about 20 years ago).  One, Michelle, has passed away and he visits her grave and seems to express more reverence for her than the others...he even tells Winston he loved Michelle and she is the only one he says that about.  Another is Laura played by Sharon Stone.  Don gets to sleep with Laura again and he doesn't seem as surprised as I was when Laura's flirty teen daughter Lolita walks about the house in nothing but her epidermis.  Her overt sexuality probably mirrors that of her mother's and Don seems unfazed by it...great dead pan acting once again by Bill Murray. Dora is another former girlfriend and she is played by Frances Conroy.  Dora seems to contain an underlying regret in her decision to choose a lifestyle completely different than the one she practiced when Don met her.  Jessica Lange plays another former girlfriend who works as an animal communicator.  All three of these women seem to initially react quite positively to Don and are pleasantly surprised to see him, but they are still interesting and unique in their own ways. Finally, Penny is played by Tilda Swinton and seems to be the only former girlfriend that is really disgusted with seeing Don.  I won't reveal how Don's journey ends but I will say that he is given an opportunity to reflect on his life during his travels, and that is something he badly needed.<br /><br />Perhaps Broken Flowers doesn't ask that we read into the clues as to who sent the letter and if Don will find his son.  If you look carefully in the credits and perhaps watch the movie again you will find some decent resolution to those questions but that isn't necessarily what Jarmusch is telling us about Don.  Broken Flowers is not about a father meeting his son as much as it is about a man becoming a father.<br /><br />To note further on the film's content, I must say that I always enjoy the atmosphere of a Jarmusch film, as much as they may require a bit of patience.  Some will find it to be a slow movie but it is both fascinating and funny.  In my humble opinion, it also happened to have the best soundtrack of 2005.</p></body></html>

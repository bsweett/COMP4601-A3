<meta name="summary" content="Aliens vs Predator-Requiem for a Series"></head><body><p>Alien vs Predator (AVP)-Requiem was a two star film which had five star special effects.  I agree with the previous comment that the action scenes were a bit dark and hard to see, although this was true of the first Alien and did not ruin that film.<br /><br />A few firsts were scored which I think crossed the line for explicit gore and screen violence. The AVP series targets die-hard fans of the Alien vs Predator magazine.  It is hard to say AVPR "crossed the line" when the original Alien was so explicit, but seldom do we see violence done to children, and as a parent it really bothered me.<br /><br />I will not be ruining the film for anybody by writing that the setting of the story was a small town in Colorado where what happened was exactly what Ripley feared the most.  The Alien manages to land on Earth and very quickly multiples. You can imagine what happens next.<br /><br />I really never expected to see Ripley's nightmare on film, and suppose I should appreciate someone trying to bring it to the screen. In this film the Alien was (sort of) under the supervision of the Predator who attempted to eliminate it while having some good clean Predator fun.<br /><br />The second AVP film tried to recapture the successful elements of Aliens, right down to stealing some of the lines outright, screeching sound effects of Aliens under fire, the presence of soldiers with massive firepower and plenty of face huggers to go around.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie but have to admit that after 25 years of the Alien legacy it is starting to grow thin. I would really like to see someone produce a serious film of the Ripley scenario and portray what happens in a sequel to Alien-Resurrection, in which only the Alien is permitted to contaminate the Earth.</p></body></html>

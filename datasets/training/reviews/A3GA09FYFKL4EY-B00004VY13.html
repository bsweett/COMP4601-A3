Campbell's classic novella, "The Thing From Another World" will recognize Carpenter's rendition as a far more accurate cinematic retelling than the 1950s "The Thing From Another World" (Although it was cool to see James Arness as the monster in that one!). Carpenter's grisly but realistic flick remains a classic 20 years after its release. A must for the serious fantasy aficionado's collection</p></body></html>

In truth Spielberg didn't take sides and neither did writers Tony Kushner ("Angels in America") and Eric Roth; Spielberg's film is a complex look at the cost of violence and murder. Avener (Eric Bana)and his team of former Mosad members (Daniel Craig the new James Bond, Hans Zischler, Ciaran Hinds and Matheu Kassovitz)discover that the cost of violence is the loss of your soul as they try and track down members of the terrorist group Black September that planned the kidnapping and murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games. Over the course of a year Avner and his men hunt down these men while becoming the hunted as well. It's a riveting thriller with strong performances from the entire cast. Brilliantly directed by Spielberg "Munich" may run about 15 minutes too long but this powerful suspense film never wavers or loses its momentum as it thunders towards its conclusion. For those who claim that "Munich" ripped off its plot from the TV movie "Sword of Gideon" it should be noted that both are based on the same book and the scenes that have the most similarity are those that are drawn from the book.<br /><br />The transfer looks terrific with the subdued colors and fine detail captured in perfectly on disc. While occasional digital flaws come up (such as edge enhancement) they are minor and only crop up on occasion. I'm at a loss as to why Universal and Dreamworks have elected to release this in the same configuration as the "War of the Worlds" DVD late last year. More than likely it's due to reduce the cost of the discs since many retailers offer these big blockbusters as loss leaders to get people into stores and this would allow the studio to create economical versions that won't eat into their profit margins too much.<br /><br />The single disc edition has only a introduction by Steven Spielberg and some trailers as the only extras. The two disc edition although it lacks a commentary track from Spielberg (to date he hasn't done any)does feature a number of interesting featurettes. They don't make up for the lack of a comprehensive documentary on the real event (the best documentary on the Munich assassinations is "One Day in September")or a commentary track by Spielberg and/or the writers who worked on the film but are pretty good overall.<br /><br />"Memories of an Event" presents Spielberg and Kushner recalling their reactions when they heard about what occurred. "Portrait of an Era" provides insight and information about recreating the early 70's for the film. "The On-Set Experience" gives us onset footage of the shooting of the film. "The International Cast", "Editing, Sound and Music" gives us insight into both the casting for the film and why Spielberg went with the choices he did (for example Spielberg had been thinking about Bana after seeing "Hulk") and "Editing, Sound and Music" takes us into the post-production of the film. It was done on an extremely tight schedule because of the predetermined release date and post-production of "War of the Worlds". "The Mission, The Team" focuses on the genesis of the script, Spielberg's interest through production. We also get a collectable booklet with photos and rave review quotes from critics.<br /><br />While the 2 disc edition isn't essential it will be a nice catch for fans of the film and those into the film process. The single disc edition should be fine for most folks. "Munich" isn't an easy film to watch nor does it take political sides. Spielberg recognizes that the killing for any political reason has its consequences and tolls on the human soul.</p></body></html>

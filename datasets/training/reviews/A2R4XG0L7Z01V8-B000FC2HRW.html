I especially liked the fact that in you can take control of whether the characters die or don't die. Although I resisted when I first got it, and watched the theatrical version.<br /><br />I've now watched it twice, the theatrical version and today, the Choose Your Fate version. I didn't really change too much at first about the second version, although I ended up saving Frankie Cheeks (why?!) and if you choose the 76 degrees during the tanning salon scene, you actually see a slightly changed version of it - although both girls still die. Also, for previous reviewers who have had a little moan about the fact there's no links between this & the previous two, there is, but it's well hidden. Watch the Choose Your Fate version, and then right towards the end, in the train scene, the old guy who's sleeping on a bench, has newspapers covering him. You'll get the option to read an article on the newspaper, and there's your link to the previous movie. Very very cool.<br /><br />The actors in this are all amazing, especially Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), she has the amazing ability to cry at the drop of the hat, even when she wasn't really crying, just tearing up. Her and the actress who played her sister, could have been sisters in real life they looked so alike! Also, Kris Lemeche, who played Ian McKinley, was brilliant! I actually developed a tiny little crush on him during the film, but mainly because he reminded me so much of Christian Slater's character in Heathers. The look, the dry humour, the one liners - it was all Christian Slater! The rest of the actors were alright, dispensible really.<br /><br />The tanning salon scene really freaked me out! Having been to tanning salons many times before (albeit, in the upright booths) I knew about this in advance (I read the novelisation when I was on holiday), so I was prepared to see it, but it still really freaked me out. It's just so well filmed, almost realistic, and my skin literally felt like it was burning afterwards.<br /><br />The rollercoaster scenes were scary too. I've only been on two rollercoasters in my life, and I don't plan going on any again. The first one I kept my eyes closed the entire time, the second time was a tiny one on holiday.<br /><br />I LOVED the new element to the Final Destination franchise, clues being left to how each character is going to die. Very well thought out, and lots of different and original deaths. All the clues are stored in photos taken, and there's little clues left in all of them to how that individual character is going to die. It makes for great fun for the viewers to work out what's going to happen.<br /><br />The final was changed after test screenings from audiences proved negative, but I have to say I liked the original ending, and the alternate. The alternate brings a new spin onto things, and definitely makes you jump.<br /><br />The extras on this are amazing, and very informative, although there are a couple that are actually LONGER than the film itself. There's some great scenes of how they filmed the rollercoaster scene (which is a shame, as you can spot what they've done in the film afterwards), and in one night, the actors had to ride the rollercoaster 26 times, so they could get all the shots in - and some hilarity as everyone takes bets on who's gonna throw up first.<br /><br />Listen out for Tony Todd as the voice of the devil (how appropriate), and also the train announcer at the end of the movie.<br /><br />This is definitely my favourite out of all 3 of the Final Destination films, and will definitely be watching it again, just so I can try all the different outcomes of the Choose Your Fate feature.</p></body></html>

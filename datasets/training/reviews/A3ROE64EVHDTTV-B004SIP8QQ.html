Still a smooth and clear picture.<br />*Still a good story, with a very good conclusion.  Also fills in lots of gaps from the first film.<br />*Still an excellent group of characters that you can relate to.  It is especially interesting to see Bill for the first time.<br />*Dialogue is strong and interesting.<br />*More interesting music.<br />*Lots of homage to westerns, kung fu, and anime.  These elements are blended together to make a very unique picture.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*It's longer and there's much less action.<br />*Still has some absurd, unrealistic parts (but this can be a good thing, because it makes the film stylish and fun).<br /><br />This is a definate must-see for anybody who has seen the first film.  All of the missing story elements are present, and brings everything into clarity.  The conclusion is excellent (even if there is no fighting).  I don't think this is as stylish or exciting as the first film, but it is definately worthwhile to see the complete story.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better then its sounds...."></head><body><p>Ironically speaking, I enjoyed this movie even although I thought there were many things lacking in this film that could have made it into something better. The movie proves to be very entertaining, action packed and amazingly for a movie of this type, well acted. The pace is pretty even and there's a good story to the film, story of courage, loyalty and honor; three virtues on which this movie ultimately rest its soul on.<p>The movie don't do well if you really have to think deep. The fine story wasn't supported by a fine script, that much must be made clear. Some of the other reviewers have already pointed out some of the major flaws of the movie, biggest one I thought was that dumbo Roman family in distress plot. What was Antoine Fuqua thinking when he okay this??<p>But I thought the negatives were outweight by the positives. The actor who played that Saxon leader proves to be very good. I wish there were more scenes with him in it. Clive Owen held his own, Keira Knightley went from helpless girl in muck to Amazon bow-woman. Actually, she wasn't bad at all.  I think these "Woad" were nothing more then Picts of ancient Britain. Merlin seem to be more of a druid leader type but his role in this movie is very limited.<p>If any of you out there who read this, be warn that there is no Camelot, no knights in shinning armor and no love triangle in this movie. Its your basic sword and armor movie based during the period when the Western Roman Empire was disappearing from history.</p></body></html>

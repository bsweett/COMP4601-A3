<meta name="summary" content="Relentless And Tense"></head><body><p>I watched the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" back when I was in college and again when this remake was released in the theaters.  I enjoyed it very much, with its camp horror and constant terror throughout.  It was a very good film, but it's young remake is also up to the task.<br /><br />Though most people who've watched the original will probably find more wrong with this film than folks who didn't(think old Star Wars vs. new Star Wars), this new version is actually pretty good.  It has a likeable young cast who do very good jobs with their roles.  Leatherface, Granny, and the rest of the cannibalistic family are fun to watch as well.  Their interactions with each other are morbidly engaging.  R. Lee Ermey is hysterical as the sheriff.<br /><br />The film is very tense, especially when Jessica Biel realizes that her friends are being murdered and she attempts to save the few that remain.  At one point, Ermey's character takes a sick and twisted turn in one of the most tense-filled scenes in the film.  He forces one of Biel's friends to "help" him in the investigation of a suicide by re-enacting it.  Biel does a lot of running and screaming, but it is all very believable and done with good cause(obviously, I'd run too if Leatherface was chasing me).  Also, the camera manages to find Biel's bosom and midriff quite often, especially in close-ups.  We see her running with a dry, tight shirt, a wet shirt(white nonetheless), and a blood-soaked shirt.  It's obvious why we see her in this way, but I'm sure most of the gents in the crowd won't be offended.<br /><br />Overall, I was surprised at how good this film actually was.  I was actually a little tired after the constant, relentless chase scenes in the flick, which means I was really captivated by the action on the screen. It managed to haul me in and keep me interested until the credits rolled.<br /><br />In closing, I highly recommend this remake of a classic.  I do suggest you watch both of them if you haven't, but keep in mind that the original will always be tough to beat.  Give this remake a little breathing room, and you'll quickly find that it is one of the better horror flicks in recent years.</p></body></html>

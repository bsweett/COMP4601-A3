<meta name="summary" content="Gritty, realistic high seas action."></head><body><p>This is an amazing action movie set on the high seas, and I especially mean high when they are rounding cape horn.  I had watched the movie through once and felt I had missed a lot because much of the dialog seemed gibberish.  I immediately watched it a second time with closed captioning on and it helped a lot.<p>This movie has humor action and a certain reality of sea warfare.  Imagine a 12 year old officer, son of a lord commanding a group of low born navel sailor.  If you had a hard time imagining Luke Skywalker leading Rogue Squadron at age 16 and Princess Leia leading the rebels at age 19, how about age 12.  This was the royal navy in 1805.  A 16 year old was a third Lt. ranking high enough to join the officers mess and lead men into a battle.  And the navy men followed.<p>The movie is PG13 but the violence was not gory.  There is no nudity or cursing that we recall so we judge this movie to be family friendly.  More evidence that a director can make a great movie with a superior script, great acting and outstanding cinematography and special effects.  The opening battle with the sound of projectiles flying by makes you feel you are right there.. Makes you want to duck down.<p>Russell Crowe is incredible as the extremely bright, creative naval tactician and captian of the HMS Surprise who leads his men with a positive, confident swagger.  The men have nicknamed him Lucky Jack Aubrey.<p>So many things make this an outstanding movie that I must give it a, rare for me, 5 star rating.  The one annoyance of the unclear dialog, actually helps the viewer feel like they are in 1805 British times.</p></body></html>

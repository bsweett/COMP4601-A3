<meta name="summary" content="a badly scripted movie with some wrongly casted choice"></head><body><p>gary grant's mother did not look a bit like his mother, more like his wife, the age difference simply non-exist! a terrible cast. the other problem was the attitude the mother towards his son. she simply despised him, but in fact, her son was a quite successful and respectful person in the society. i just don't know why the mother role was so cynical to her son.  some of the plot twists in this movie also looked very pretentious. the genre also losing grip, could hardly determined itself either a thriller or a comedy. so many scenes simply looked too staged and too phony, the absurdity of the screenplay was self-served to be imposed as normal in a common sense, but of course, if the viewers could lose themselves from the logic, anything was possible and acceptable. in that era, most of the popular movies were all like this one, mixed with romance, suspensful twists of the scenario,  actions, thugs, beautiful and mysterious women, almsot non-stop romantic theme music, sound effect synchronized with all the movements and reactions with the actors and every part of the stories. we've watched this movie couple of times before, but this time, after watched it developed into ridiculous and pretentious scene after scene, we just hit the reject button and put it back into the plastic box. you don't have to agree with me, because this is just my personal viewing after thought.</p></body></html>

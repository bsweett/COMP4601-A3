He wants peace, quiet, and above all else : prosperity. That is until Wyatt is forced back into the life. The ruthless band of outlaws known as the Cowboys ( led by Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn), gun for Wyatt, his family, and his best friend Doc Holliday ( Val Kilmer). Now Wyatt and Doc, along with Wyatt's brothers Morgan ( Bill Paxton)and Virgil (Sam Elliot)prepare for the legendary gunfight at the O.K. Corral. <p>Before I saw &quot;Tombstone&quot;, I was never really a huge fan of Westerns. However, &quot;Tombstone&quot; was so great that it managed to turn me into a huge fan of the western genre. The shoot out scenes and overall non stop action is amazing in this film. Tombstone also gives an extremely acurate portrayal of events as well. Kurt Russell gave the best performance possible as Wyatt Earp. He nailed the fierce determination and sense of justice. Val Kilmer gave the best performance in the film as Doc Holliday. Perfect portrayal of Holliday's lifestyle consisting of: drinking, smoking, gambling, women, and a quick trigger finger. Bill Paxton and Sam Elliot make nice additions as the Earp brothers. Dana Delaney gave a nice supporting role as the actress Josephine Marcus. Unbelieveable chemistry between her and Kurt Russell!! Other well known actors include Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Jason Priestley, Stephen Lang, and Thomas Hayden Church. Billy Bob Thorton makes a hilarious cameo in the film as well. <p>When Tombstone first came out on DVD, I unfortunately ended up buying it. The movie was great, but the DVD was just plain awful. However, I was overjoyed when Tombstone became a member of the Vista Series. This automatically puts the film on a whole new level. Vista Series DVD's always provide for the best quality possible, and tons of outstanding extras. You get a making of featurette in three parts, commentary from director George P Cosmatos, and more. I have seen many Westerns since &quot;Tombstone&quot;, but it is still the greatest Western ever made in my opinion.</p></body></html>

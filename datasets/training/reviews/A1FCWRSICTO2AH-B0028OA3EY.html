<meta name="summary" content="Mystic Superman"></head><body><p>Superman Returns is a strange movie to watch.  Gone is the square jawed linebacker sized hero.  Instead, newcomer Brandon Routh gives you a Superman that is more like Michelangelo's David: an almost sylph-like figure, that floats beautifully above us all, watching, protecting.  In doing so, the movie conveys, intentional or not, a great loneliness and vulnerability in the Man of Steel, but also, always, the sense of Duty.  Essentially, I liked Routh's version of the great hero.  But the rest of the casting is not very good.  Spacey and Langella, two really fine actors, are miscast.  They never seem to capture the elusive "whatever" that director Bryan Singer was able to capture with Routh.  Spacey is viscious at Lex Luthor, but he has no style.  Luthor has to have style, but Spacey gives us a villain that is just a dead eyed figure belonging to another genre: noir. Langella seems like he's on medication, and not the hyper editor we should expect.  Only Parker Posey, as Luthor's associate and babe Kitty, seems to remember that this is a story based upon a comic book.  Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane is also miscast.  There were times I felt most of the supporting actors were sleepwalking through their roles. The story itself is somewhat incoherent, but I chalk that up to the film being something of an intended re-introduction (and grab bag) to the characters and elements of the Superman story.  However, despite all of these missteps, weirdly, the film works.  I guess, perhaps, because we all want a Superman up there, watching, protecting us all. And Superman Returns does remember that One Essential part of the story, and returns to it, smartly, again and again.</p></body></html>

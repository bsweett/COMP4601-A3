Yeah right.  The movie's about a man who travels across America and meets different people and religions and does nothing but disrespects them the entire time.  It's all because he wants to go to California and have a relationship with Pamela Anderson.<br /><br />The best way to respect the REAL people who actually had their feelings hurt during the recording of this film is to give it a low rating.  Sure, I laughed at a few parts, such as the bear in the ice cream truck scaring away children and the two naked men wrestling each other in the bedroom (in a very disgusting, almost sexual, way).  Still, everything about the movie was more about shocking the audience instead of delivering a satisfying story.  When the movie was finally released, many people found out they were involved in the film who didn't have a clue about it while the film was being made, and these people felt absolutely sick about the movie, and rightfully so.<br /><br />One man going across America making fun of all the cultures and religions isn't funny to me.  People have a right to hate this movie with a passion.  Some people try to convince me Borat didn't mean to make fun of the people in the film, but the expression on his face that he's supposedly clueless when in fact he's actually knowledgeable about different cultures paints a more accurate picture.  Avoid.</p></body></html>

I thought Phillip Seymore Hoffman made a good sociopath, frankly I wish he had been in it more.  This movie is definitely action packed, it's exhaustively so, actually.  I really not a big fan of these Mission movies, they are not nearly as good as the Bourne films, but this one kept me interested and I didnt find myself rolling my eyes as much as I had in the other two Mission movies.  I appreciated that they gave Ethan a genuine love interest, and I liked how much of the movie was in flashback, that made it more riviting.  After the second Mission movie I was not looking forward to another, but after seeing this, I'd definitely see another.  Like I stated earlier, this is hardly up to any of the great Bourne movies, but without a question worth a viewing.</p></body></html>

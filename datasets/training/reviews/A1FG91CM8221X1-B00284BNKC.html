<meta name="summary" content="No middle ground on this film? Oh yes there is."></head><body><p>"No middle ground here: you'll either love or hate `Requiem for a Dream,'" the dust cover publicity reads. I beg to differ: I admired the film for its intensity, its fine if unorthodox craftsmanship, and its superb performances, but I found it so harrowing and depressing that I can't imagine how anyone could ever love it. Director Darren Aronofsky, writing the screenplay with Hubert Selby Jr. from Selby's novel, strives to recreate the subjective experience of a junkie's addiction, to an extent even films such as "Drugstore Cowboy" failed to do. Working with cinematographer Matthew Libatique, editor Jay Rabinowitz and sound man Brian Emmerich, Aronofsky assaults us with the sensory experience of addiction, as experienced by four pathetic losers: junkie Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and speed freak mother Sarah (Ellen Burstyn). Each becomes the perfect, and perfectly horrible, example of the different private hells that junkies fall into. All four actors are superb, but the standout is Burstyn, the saddest of all, a lonely widow who becomes addicted to diet pills in the vain hope of landing a spot on a TV game show. The sight of Burstyn imploding in paranoiac terror, as she hallucinates that her refrigerator is attacking her and the people on TV are laughing at her, will be etched in your memory forever. Whether you want it to be, of course, is another matter. I was glad I saw "Requiem for a Dream," but I think once was enough. The DVD, however, is cleverly packaged (as a video by Tappy Tibbons, the TV motivational speaker Burstyn is obsessed with, played with smarmy ferocity by Christopher McDonald). It contains a compelling "Making Of" documentary, as well as a bonus video of Ellen Burstyn interviewing Hubert Selby, who is still the unhappiest kid in Brooklyn after all these years.</p></body></html>

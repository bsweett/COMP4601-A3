A cop resists and walks around this nasty marsh and does what the thinks he's right. But a dark complot awaits for him and after eight years in prison he will have to make justice by his own . The other mixed story collides with Nancy in the bar, where Marty tries desperately to seek the murder of Goldie the only woman who loved him although his ugliness (Mickey Rourke is in top form with this underground character who reminds to Johnny the handsome).<br /><br />The third story is about the last frontier, habited by women who live and survive from harassments, abuses, rapes and unthinkable touches of evil.<br /><br />The film is told, through voices in off, another honoured tribute to the Noir genre. There are emblematic scenes, filled of artistic violence in the middle of the endless night.<br /><br />From its immediate release, it became a cult movie.</p></body></html>

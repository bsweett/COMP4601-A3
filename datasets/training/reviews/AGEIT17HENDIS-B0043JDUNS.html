<meta name="summary" content="Iron Man 2 Meets Cold War 3"></head><body><p>Almost always sequels, especially action-packed sequels, suffer by comparison with the first production. That is the case here with Iron Man 2. What made the original Iron Man interesting, beyond the finely-tuned performance by Robert Downey, Jr. as the "frat brat", poor little rich boy, Tony Stark, out to find his place in the world, and incidentally act as the sole defensive shield necessary to save the old U.S.A., was the creation of Iron Man and that first struggle against the world's evil metal. IM2 already figured to extend that monster metal notion, although harking back to the old Cold War days with a Russian antagonist (Mickey Rourke, as Ivan Vanko) out to revenge old hurts was a curious twist. Iron Man, naturally, despite a few aging "heart" problems single-handedly (oops, double-handedly, he has a partner here). The plot left me with this feeling-Ya okay, what of it.<br /><br />As for the boy meets girl aspect (Downey and his administrative assistant, Paltrow), or I should say "boy met girl" since they already got kind of moony-eyed in the first picture, an aspect that is always sexually and romantically understated in these comic book-drawn movies (Spider Man, Super Man, etc.) they continue that chaste romance here. What I don't get is why a sensible woman like Downey's "Girl Friday" would have anything to do with a, well yes, a good-looking guy with a zillion dollars, with some "boss" fast cars, and with access to all kinds of techno-gadgets. A no-brainer, right?  At least, serious, chaste, "kick butt" governmental agent Scarlett Johansson didn't fall for all that superficial stuff. And she trashed his performance (not a team player) as well. Smart woman.</p></body></html>

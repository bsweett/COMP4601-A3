<meta name="summary" content=""As Time Goes By." "Here's Looking At You, Kid." A Classic."></head><body><p>This cinematic masterpiece won 3 Academy Awards in 1943: Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay. The acting as is timeless as the movie itself. Screen legends Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman make the perfect pair as star-crossed lovers Rick and Ilsa who meet again in war-torn unoccupied France. Paul Henreid is memorable as resistance fighter/leader Victor Laszlo. Claude Rains ("The Adventures Of Robin Hood", etc.) is a cross between neutral and non-neutral as Louis Renault, prefect of police. Peter Lorre is subtly devious as the scheming Ugarte. Sydney Greenstreet ("The Maltese Falcon", etc.) is an accessory as Rick's business rival Ferrari. Conrad Veidt oozes pure venom as the evil Major Strasser. The movie works very well, not only in terms of story, but the techniques that were used: flashbacks where almost all of it was music, close-ups of the characters in the right places, etc. Max Steiner (Oscar winner for "Gone With The Wind" four years earlier) composed the score for this bittersweet tale of love, intrigue and patriotism. The movie's only real special features are the original theatrical trailer, trailers for other classic movies starring Humphrey Bogart and a revealing documentary, "You Must Remember This" (the first line of "As Time Goes By", featured in the film), which offers an exclusive look at the making of this landmark movie, hosted by none other than Bogie's wife (from 1945, a year after they starred in "To Have And Have Not" until his untimely death in 1957) and legendary actress, Lauren Bacall. This movie also should've won Bogie the Oscar for Best Actor, Ms. Bergman Best Actress, Mr. Steiner Best Score and Best Song ("As Time Goes By"). One of the movie's final lines, "Round Up The Usual Suspects", was the inspiration for the mind-bending, Oscar-winning film "The Usual Suspects." (Look for my review of that twist-filled thriller later on). This film is, in the strictest sense of the word, a classic. Features the famous line "Here's looking at you, kid" and the timeless song "As Time Goes By." Rated PG for mild thematic elements and some violence.</p></body></html>

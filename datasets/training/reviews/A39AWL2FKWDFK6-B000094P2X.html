<meta name="summary" content="Decent Silence of the Lambs prequel"></head><body><p>Red Dragon, the third in the series of flicks featuring Dr. Hannibal &quot;the Cannibal&quot; Lecter is merely okay as a psychological thriller.  I found the character development, particularly that of Francis &quot;The Red Dragon&quot; Dolarhyde to be superficial, with Dr. Lecter's character the notable exception.<p>The story was an intriguing one but for the most part the characters seemed to be made of cardboard.  Ed Norton, one of the finest young contemporary actors, as the FBI profiler was meek and whiny.  Ralph Fiennes, a brilliant classical actor seemed uninspired as the driven and diabolical killer.  Anthony Hopkins was brilliant, as usual, as the cultured, refined yet horrific Dr. Lecter.  Harvey Keitel was nothing special but Anthony Heald as the self serving and loathsome Dr. Chilton was terrific.<p>With a wonderful cast to work with director Brett Ratner came up short in his shallow adaptation of Thomas Harris' chilling novel.</p></body></html>

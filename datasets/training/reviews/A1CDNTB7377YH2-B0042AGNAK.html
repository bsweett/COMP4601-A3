Since I make it a point to see all Marvel movies I waited for it to come out on disc.  I wish I had seen it in the theater because it was a good film and I missed out on the special effects of seeing it on the big screen.<br /><br />The beginning of the film is like a Twilight Zone episode as Johnny Blaze makes a deal with the devil to save his father.  Of course the deal comes with a catch.  Afterwards, Johnny is a servant of the devil called a Ghost Rider, to do his bidding.<br /><br />Johnny loses touch with his girlfriend (Eva Mendez's younger sister?) and then meets up with her years later (Eva Mendez) as he is the star of an Evel Kneivel type stunt show and she is a reporter covering his daredevil jump.<br /><br />To say any more of the plot would be a spoiler to those who haven't seen it, but the movie has some great special effects (Johnny riding his flaming motorcycle up and down the sides of buildings) and some surprisingly good supporting cast acting.  Sam Elliot, plays a mysterious grave digger who seems to know a lot about Johnny and ironically Peter Fonda who starred in all those motorcycle films is the devil.<br /><br />The battle between good (or should I say semi-good) and evil is great as Johnny turns into an avenging demon at night when he is around evil.</p></body></html>

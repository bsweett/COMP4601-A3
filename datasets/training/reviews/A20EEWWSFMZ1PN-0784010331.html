Dick (screenplay by Ronald Shussett, Dan O'Bannon, and Gary Goldman). Add a well-designed set that make you feel you are there. In addition, you have the makings for a pretty good movie. With a few exceptions, it is hard to tell the good guys from the bad and with several plot twists; it is hard to know if you should root for the good guy or the bad. A hint stick with Arnold and you cannot go wrong (Maybe.)<br /><br />Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) a mild mannered construction worker, who is happily married to Lori (Sharon Stone), and seems extraordinarily attracted to life on Mars. Now Mars is settled and basically ran by a mining consortium. Moreover, the least Douglas can do is take a vacation there. Discouraged by his wife he decided to take a virtual trip there.<br /><br />Oh no, something has gone wrong. It turns out that unknown to him he is not Douglas Quaid. He finds out that his whole history is a lie. Now people are out to kill him and he must find out who he is and why. If he escapes, the journey will take him to Mars to fulfill his or someone's destiny.  Good or bad, we are along for the ride.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001Z37HM">Red Sonja</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Warner Bros. tries a new "Maxwell Smart"."></head><body><p>This review is for the Get Smart Full-Screen edition that came with the Invisble Ink Spy Pen with Ultraviolet Decoder Light in the package. It really works.<br />  The DVD will start automatically after 1 minute and a half, if you have not made a movie version choice.<br />  You may choose the Theatrical version or the Special Feature of clicking on an icon throughout the movie for never-seen-before additional scenes.<br /><br />  Inside the DVD case is your full-screen disc, but also instuctions and your secret authorization code to download your digital copy of Get Smart.<br /><br />No audio commentary.<br /><br />  The original "Get Smart" tv series was broadcast on ABC 1965-69 and CBS 1969-70.  The series starred Don Adams as "Maxwell Smart" and Barbara Feldon as "Agent 99".  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNS8">Get Smart - Season 1 (The Original TV Series)</a><br />  10 years later, Don Adams returned as Agent 86 in a Get Smart motion pictures, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015ESSU4">The Nude Bomb</a> (1980). It was retitled and edited for television as "The Return of Maxwell Smart".<br />  Don Adams and Barbara Feldon reteamed for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JMKJSC">Get Smart Again</a> (1989-tvm) with Dick Gautier returning as "Hymie".<br />  Don and Barbara reteamed again for the FOX tv series, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001666484">Get Smart: The Complete Series</a> in 1995.<br />  Don Adams passed away September 25, 2005 of Pulmonery Infection.<br /><br />  For this motion picture reboot of "Get Smart", Steve Carell is Agent 86 with Anne Hathaway (Princess Diaries (2001), Princess Diaries 2 (2004)) as Agent 99.<br />  Alan Arkin as "The Chief", Terence Stamp as "Siegfried" David Koechner as "Larabee", Bill Murray as "Agent 13", Patrick Warburtun as "Hymie".<br />  Only Bernie Kopell, who appeared 14 times as "Siegfried" in the original "Get Smart" tv series, makes an all too brief cameo appearance.<br />  For die hard fans of the tv series, this movie will be a hard pill to swallow.  Steve Carell does not have the voice or the characture that Don Adams add made famous.<br />  28 minutes into the film, I could not stand it anymore. I turned it off and went to bed.<br />  I decided to give it another try 2 weeks later. I liked Anne Hathaway in the strong character and it was nice to see the likeable Alan Arkin in a movie again.<br />  It was Dalip Singh who was a scene stealer in this film. I really took notice. I had not seen him before this film, but I found out he has been the wrestler, The Great Khali.  Pardon me for saying this, but Mr. Singh reminded me of Richard Kiel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VZPQFI">Eegah (1962)</a>,who played "Jaws" in the 2 "James Bond" films, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M53GN6">The Spy Who Loved Me</a>(1977), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIBURG">Moonraker</a>(1979).<br /><br />Also in the cast: Dwayne Johnson, James Caan, Ken Davitian, Larry Miller, Kevin Nealon.<br /><br />  Why didn't they have Bernie Kopell play "Siegfried" in this film?<br /><br />  Masi Oka and Nate Torrence ( Nate, whom you have seen in many tv commercials) who play Bruce & Lloyd in this "Get Smart" film, continued their roles in a made-for-DVD movie sequel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018O4SOQ">Get Smart's Bruce and Lloyd Out of Control</a> (2008)",  released just 10 days after "Get Smart" was released in the movie theatre.</p></body></html>

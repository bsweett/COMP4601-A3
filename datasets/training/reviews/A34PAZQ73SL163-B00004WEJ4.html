Like all of the great ones, this film is not tarnished by its age.  The unfortunate thing is that, in 2005, so much of the dialogue has so fully entered our cultural lexicon that the new viewer may be disappointed as to how cliche it sounds.  Yet, none of the lines like "play it again Sam," "...out of all of the gin joints" and "this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship," were ever heard before Casablanca's release. Sure, Bogey is stupendous as is Bergman but what about Claude Rains? He practically steals the title role away from Rick.  His character is incredibly complex and interesting.  It is somewhat amusing as to the favorable spin that the French are given, but we must remember that back in 1941 they were a defeated ally.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Meet Maggie and Frankie; Simply Told Story About Boxing as Life"></head><body><p>Though 'Million Dollar Baby' features a detemined boxer Maggie, who starts her career at the age of 31, the film is not about the sports itself; boxing is only a metaphor for life, and you can easily find that out after seeing what happens to three main characters<br /><br />The film is about these people -- hardened ex-boxing trainer Frankie, retired boxer Eddie (who lost sight of one of his eyes), and Maggie for whom boxing is all she's got.  They are played by Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman respectively, and they all deserve the awards and praises they have already got, for what they have done as real professional actors.  In short, their acting is simply great.<br /><br />Don't follow the story.  Some people, quite understandably, thought that this is a female version of 'Rocky.'  Don't get me wrong here, for to me 'Rocky' is also one of the greatest films ever made.  To those who expect 'Rocky'-type story, some part of 'Million Dollar Baby' might be depressing, especially when the film ends in an unexpected way.  But remember, Rocky in fact didn't win the bout (Apollo did), but you know that is not the point.  The point is, like star Stallone himself, it was a do-or-die project, and he did it.<br /><br />And boxing is the do-or-die project for Maggie, and you will know that at the end of the film.  You will get to know the believable characters (including the ones who hang around the old boxing gym), and the film slowly reveals the life of them on screen.<br /><br />The slow-moving pace of the film may not appeal to you.  Actually, some might find part of the film a bit dull.  I did, but I also know this is a kind of film in which you have to keep the same pace with the realistic characters because in reality things just don't happen so fast.  Then, after leaving the theater, the images of Maggie and Frankie will remain with you.</p></body></html>

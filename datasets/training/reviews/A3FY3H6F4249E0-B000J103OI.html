<meta name="summary" content="The Fashion Industry"></head><body><p>An excellent performance by Meryl Streepe (aka Miranda Priestly/Dragon Lady).  Miranda is somebody really big in the fashion industry.  She is soooo big, that everybody jumps to her every desire, including designers, writers, photographers, etc.  Miranda runs a huge fashion business and fashion magazine based out of New York City.  Miranda keeps 2 personal assistants and has only one (Emily) right now and Miranda is looking for a second assistant.  This is the job that "a million girls would die for," as you will hear said several times.  The "devil" wearing Prada does not refer to a Satan figure.  It is just that Miranda is such an unapproachable person, so much so that when she comes in to work, everybody else quickly walks the other way and the workers all go into complete panic.<br /><br />Enters Anne Hathaway, as Andria, a simple girl with a degree in journalism.  Andria is immediately snubbed by Emily and Miranda as having no fashion sense and totally wrong for the job, but Miranda decides to hire Andria anyway, against her better judgement.  Miranda is truly the boss from hell.  Working for her is faster paced than Superman can fly.  She is abrupt, demanding, cold, and volitile.  You are also on call 24/7 and the pay is not that great.  Andria is trying her best but getting frustrated fast when finally she decided to get with the program.  Seeking the assistance of male co-worker and fashion coordinator for Miranda, Nigel, Andria sheds her dumpy sweaters and black school-girl tights and starts dressing in the high-fashion style from the company's supply.  This begins to please Dragon Lady and Andria/Andy begins to acquire bigger and better job responsibilities.  Andy also begins to take on the all-for-business personality more in-keeping with her new line of dress.  Her friends and boyfriend don't really like the changes either.<br /><br />The movie is about the big business of the high fashion industry, even taking you to Paris designer shows.  It's about intense career committment that is above a personal life.  It's also about change, what's important, wheeling and dealing in the corporate world, disappointments, and caring or not caring about people. The "Devil Wears Prada" could also be a comparison to the concept of giving your personal life over to the corporate world.<br /><br />I guess you would call this a chick-flick.  I don't see where most guys would be interested in it.</p></body></html>

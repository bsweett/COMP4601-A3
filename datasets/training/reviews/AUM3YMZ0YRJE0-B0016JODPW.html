This is nothing short of agony to watch, bringing up the deepest fears that one might feel about the trajectory of one's life.  This is on a par with Death of a Salesman, but updated to include drugs and murder.  It is an obvious artistic success, though it might give you insomnia and anxiety.  If you want to experience these things, I would recommend this film.</p></body></html>

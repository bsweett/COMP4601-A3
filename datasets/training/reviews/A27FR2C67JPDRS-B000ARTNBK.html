<meta name="summary" content="A fantastic foursome!"></head><body><p>Marvel Comics is on a roll.....Spiderman and the Xmen became big blockbusters (and the Hulk and Daredevil, to a lessor extent) and now the Fantastic Four can be added to their roster of entertaining heroes transferred to film.<br /><br />The film starts with the origin of the four, which moves a little slowly to begin with, but picks up the action as the film progresses.  Once the foursome begin to realize what their powers are, as well as the villain, Dr. Doom, coming to terms with his own powers, the fight between good and evil kicks into gear.<br /><br />Ioan Gruffold does a nice job as Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic), a scientist who has a better relationship with numbers and his science than with the woman he truely loves, Sue Storm (Invisible Girl).  Sue's cocky brother (Human Torch) and friend Ben Grimm (The Thing) provide a lot of the comic relief for the film.  Of the four, the Human Torch and the Thing seemed to be the best developed.  Hopefully we will see more character development for Reed and Sue in the inevitable sequel.<br /><br />The special effects were really good, especially the Human Torch.  I was afraid the Torch's look, as well as that of Mr. Fantastic's stretchy skin wouldn't translate well to the big screen.  This film, however, made it look good.  Michael Chiklis is probably the standout of the four, becoming the monsterous looking Thing, dealing with his new appearance and the amazing strength he has acquired.<br /><br />Probably the weakest link in the film is Dr. Doom played by Julian McMahon of television's Nip/Tuck.  Once he became Dr. Doom, it would have been nice to have heard a darker, more sinister voice coming from the mask.  Overall, though, I think he did a fair job.  I hope they make him even darker in the next film, should he return as the villain<br /><br />As with any hero story, the first film deals with the origin of its hero or heroes.  With the sequel, the director can start out with action without taking out time to explain the beginnings of the character.  With a little fine tuning, the Fantastic Four will become a very good film franchise for Marvel Comics like Spiderman and X-Men.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the comic books or a good action film, this is movie is for you.  I really enjoyed it and intend to add it to my dvd collection, once it is released.</p></body></html>

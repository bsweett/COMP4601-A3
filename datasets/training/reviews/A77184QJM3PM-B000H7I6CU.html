What this means is that this is a well-made, incredibly visualized film with a good story, strong characters, and a plot moral to make you feel things both during and after the film is done. While this film may not be quite as strong as others in the Pixar canon, it stands up quite well on its own. The basic line of the story is to take the time in life to realize what's really important in life. To not go-go-go at breakneck speed at all times, or you'll miss out on so much that life has to offer. A big parallel is drawn between the Interstate, and the more winding Route 66. We race through life on the Interstate, when we could take the scenic route on an old winding road and see and learn so much more, about ourselves and life in general. One thing I really enjoyed in this film was the strong sense of nostalgia it evoked. So many towns withered and died when their access roads suddenly were cut off by new highways. Many just didn't make it when the travelers stopped coming through, and by the magic of film, we're presented with one that almost completely dies, then comes back to life. As is usual for Pixar, the voice-over work is inspired, with many Pixar-veterans at work again here. The sound is wonderful, with the roar of a full-scale race doing laps through my surround-sound system. The picture quality is exceptional, the cars here gleam like I wish mine did! Oh well, that's the magic of movies! This fine film keeps Pixar's winning streak rolling on, what is it now, seven straight hits with no bombs anywhere? Anyway, get this film for yourself and take the time to enjoy a little side trip down Route 66.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Overall a good sequel,despite some pacing problems"></head><body><p>For me, the biggest problem with Hostel: Part II is the movie is just too clich&eacute;d. From the characters to the concept it suffers from having been there, done that. It's tough sometimes making a sequel. You wanna try and offer something different, but cannot stray too much from the formula and risk losing the fan base. Though I will say is Eli Roth does manage to do more than just rehash the original, granted I just said before it suffers from the, been there, done that, but Roth is able to add a little bit more.<br /><br />The thing about Eli Roth is he is able to develop characters. A lot of people knock him for his characters and say they lack depth. That couldn't be further from the truth. Just because you didn't like them doesn't mean they lacked depth. In both Hostel movies it takes at least 40-minutes before anything really big happens. Everything before that is all about the characters.<br /><br />This time around Roth again sets up the characters and develops them, but the problem here is they are too clich&eacute;d. We have the nerdy girl, the slutty girl and the nice girl with a little bit of an edge. The characters in Hostel: Part II is the typical characters we have seen millions of times before. Due to that it can be tough to really feel for them. Though to Roth's credit they don't come across as fake; they are real people maybe even like someone you know. So due to that you might feel for them a bit when these bad things begin to happen to them.<br /><br />Hostel: Part II also focuses a bit on the people involved with Elite Hunting, from those who run it and the people that pay to do these terrible things to others. That was an interesting concept, but does take away from the mystery of it. So it's sort of that double edged sword. And like the would be victims the characters who pay to do these terrible things are also a bit clich&eacute;d, one guy who's excited, but afterwards can't handle it and the weak guy who suddenly steps up and goes psycho.<br /><br />Eli Roth's script wasn't bad, the characters have depth despite being clich&eacute;d, but something just wasn't fully working. While not a bad script it didn't have the moments the original had. Like I said the characters have depth and you do get to know them a bit, but when all is said and done the clich&eacute; is what hurts. But the script wasn't bad, and it did have its fair share of creative moments.<br /><br />Like the original, Roth takes his time getting into things, but this time around it doesn't work quite as well. The comedy here doesn't work as well and it does hurt the pacing of the movie at times and the nudity is very much toned down this time around. Eli Roth is able to put together some solid scenes, but the pacing does drag at times. The party scene really does start to drag and it seems like it goes on forever. A couple of minutes could have easily been trimmed on that scene.<br /><br />Once the action kicks in Hostel II does pick up. Though it does lack compared to the original, but it still works rather well for the most part. Even in the 2nd half there are slight pacing problems. Hostel: Part II would have greatly benefited from a few minutes being cut out. There isn't that sense of dread and tension the original had. While Hostel II does have it's moments like that it does lack compared to the original. But there are some solid moments with a great feel of dread and looming danger. The scene with one of the characters hung upside down and being sliced was probably my favorite scene, it was sick and twisted and had this great sense of tension. The character is totally helpless and it does add to the tension.<br /><br />The gore level is about the same as the original. In some ways it's gorier, but also has less gore. Despite the reputation of Hostel the torture scenes weren't that bloody. There was gore, but not the way people make it out to be. A lot of the gore comes from shots of mutilated bodies. This time around the torture scenes do feature a lot more gore. I can't help, but think Roth added more for all the people that complained about the first Hostel being gory. It's like he was saying you really wanna see some gore? Well here you go.<br /><br />Lauren German gives a fantastic performance as Beth, she was the nice girl with a bit of an edge, while her character may not be the most original she isn't the little goodie two shoes most heroines are in these kinda movies. The rest of the performances are pretty good as well. Roger Bart does a solid job and Richard Burgi nearly steals the show.<br /><br />Overall Hostel: Part II is a pretty good sequel. While it does suffer from some clich&eacute;s and really doesn't have the dread and tension of the original there are many solid scenes. What they lack in tension, they make up for in gore. The pacing was just a bit off and like I said Hostel II would have greatly benefited from some editing.<br /><br />The highlights of Hostel: Part II are the cameos by 70s cult Icon Edwige Fenech as the Art Class Professor and Ruggero Deodato director of Cannibal Holocaust playing none other than a cannibal. And I must say as I write this review Edwige Fenech is almost 60-years old and is still as beautiful now as she was back in the 70s.</p></body></html>

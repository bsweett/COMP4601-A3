<meta name="summary" content="It is the cameos"></head><body><p>The movie was silly and little crude. The slapstick humor was continuous and almost boring at times. The plot was cliche and most of the jokes were too. However, the cameos were hilarious. The scene with Lance Armstrong was worth the price of the rental. The cynical appraisal of the sports and fitness industry was very accurate too. The movie made me laugh out loud, which surprised my wife. Ben Stiller was over the top, but the role called for it. He was very funny.</p></body></html>

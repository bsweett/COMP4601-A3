The difference between Reloaded and the original is that the original had more of an indie film feel with a novel premise. Reloaded cashed in by giving us better special effects with less story. Revolutions gives us less special effects, less story and some sort of a justification finale.<p>Revolutions has its problems from the onset. The story is derived directly from Reloaded with little emphasis on the original movie. There are too many characters from Reloaded given a way too much screen time in Revolutions and other characters from Reloaded are simply omitted (The Twins), dealt with too briefly (Morpheus, The Architect) or forgotten about in the course of the movie (The Trainman). Some characters are even changed (the oracle is replaced because of the original actresses death.) New characters are introduced but they have very little bearing on the story. So what is it all about? <p>The truth is that Revolutions is just plain crap. It is served along with Reloaded as an "enjoy the special effects... but that is all there is to it." type of film. The effects in Reloaded are better. The center action piece in Revolutions revolves around the machines attacking Zion with "Aliens" type robot units manned by soldiers fighting them off. The other action sequence is the fight between Neo and Agent Smith which is not nearly as good as the one in the original movie.<p>The film does not end too badly but it does leave you feeling unsatisfied. Bottom line is that you should go to see it but it really is not a very good blockbuster movie by a long shot. (...)<p>Fans will not be too happy.</p></body></html>

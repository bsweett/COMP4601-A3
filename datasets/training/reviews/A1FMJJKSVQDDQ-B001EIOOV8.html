Casino is slowly being put on my list. This is a fantastic 178-minute film by Martin Scorsese, which is sadly underlooked. Maybe it's because it is quite similar to Goodfellas: two of the same cast members, same gangster themes, etc. But anyways, I seem to prefer this to Goodfellas, which is also a great movie. Here, we get to see some equally disturbing images ("In the end, I had to put his ****ing head in a vice") and a more excessive use of the F and S words (the F word being used 398 times in just under three hours).<br /><br />And not only that, we get to see some of the finest performances by De Niro, Stone, and Pesci. De Niro plays Sam Rothstein, one of the top handicappers in Las Vegas. As the owner of the fictional Tangiers casino who has connections with the Mafia, he looks to be an egotistical perfectionist, who treats his workers as if they're drug addicts. On the soft side, though, he is a caring family man who would do anything to protect his wife and child. De Niro should have at least been nominated for an oscar: here he is at the top of his game. He brings his trademark attitude into the picture, never losing his cool and never surrendering to overacting.<br /><br />You all know what Joe Pesci is capable of. Starring as Nicky Santoro, he is a hotheaded psychopath who relies on his balls instead of his head. He uses his explosively violent attitude to solve many of his problems, with disturbing and darkly hilarious results. I would NEVER want to confront a person like him. Pesci sure steals the show with his cursing and his aggressive personality, and he's clearly one of the reasons why I like Casino.<br /><br />I was never a fan of Sharon Stone, but she shines in this movie. She plays Rothstein's beautiful but obnoxious wife who takes her time smoking, drinking, taking pills, and embracing her husband's money. She is a woman that people love to hate, and she would care less what we all think of her.<br /><br />To be honest, what I like more than the performances is the overall flow of the film. This is half documentary, half mobster flick. Rothstein and Santoro become the narrators, and show us what happens in the Tangiers, and what sort of business they run. The narration may slow the film down a few times, but the information is just what we need in order to understand what type of people are running, and making money off of, the casino.<br /><br />In short, Casino is an excessively violent film with excessive profanity. Goodfellas may be the more popular film, but personally I have more admiration for Casino. Kudos to Scorsese, De Niro, Stone, Pesci, Rickles, Woods, and Vincent for making such a spectacular film.</p></body></html>

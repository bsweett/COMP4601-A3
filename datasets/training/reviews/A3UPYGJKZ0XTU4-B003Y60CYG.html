The show is taped before a live audience in the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minnesota. This movie is a look backstage during a fictional final show. The real show is alive and well, although it did take a hiatus in 1987 that lasted several years. I've never been a fan of director Robert Altman, because, as he is the first to say, he's not interested in stories. He is interested in behavior. I, on the other hand, find behavior meaningless without the context of an interesting story to make it bearable. But Robert Altman was a good choice to direct Garrison Keillor's script for "A Prairie Home Companion", which also favors behavior over story. But Keillor doesn't like neuroses, which counterbalances Altman's tendency toward the neurotic. The film is sustained by its cast and its tone -a reserved, frank, good-natured sensibility that it borrows from its real-life namesake.<br /><br />Guy Noir (Kevin Kline), a former private eye straight out of a 1940s crime film, does security for "A Prairie Home Companion", and he introduces us to the show's final performance at the Fitzgerald Theater. New corporate ownership is closing the show down for being an anachronism, and the "axeman" (Tommy Lee Jones) is expected for tonight's show. A lovely lady (Virginia Madsen) in a white trench coat has caught Guy Noir's eye as she mills around backstage, and he wonders what her presence may mean. Meanwhile, the show goes on. Garrison Keillor hosts without any intention of changing anything for the final show. The Johnson Girls, Yolanda (Meryl Streep) and Rhonda (Lily Tomlin), a lifelong singing act, chat about their family backstage and belt it out onstage, as Yolanda's morbid daughter Lola (Lindsay Lohan) watches from the wings. Dusty & Lefty (Woody Harrelson & John C. Reilly), a singing comedic cowboy act, aren't inclined to censor themselves. And stage manager Molly (Maya Rudolph) tries to keep things running smoothly with uneven success.<br /><br />Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin are so natural that it's easy to watch them. Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly are a hoot. But credit for holding the whole thing together goes to Kevin Kline. Guy Noir is the improbable character to whom we always return for some sort of odd perspective. I don't know how an actor can embody a caricature so unaffectedly that he is accepted at face value, yet we are still able to laugh at him. Kevin Kline manages. I shouldn't be surprised. Kline is almost without parallel as a comic actor. "A Prairie Home Companion" is grounded by the presence of Keillor himself and by the very genuine Maya Rudolph as the show's pregnant stage manager. They are joined by a few people from the real "Prairie Home Companion" show, including band leader Richard Dworsky. "A Prairie Home Companion" has a measured pace and, in spite of being the final show, it's open-ended. But both Robert Altman and Garrison Keillor fans will find a lot to like.<br /><br />The DVD (New Line 2006): Bonus features include extended performances from the film, a making-of featurette, a soundtrack preview, a theatrical trailer (2 min), an audio commentary, and a DVD-ROM (Windows only). "Onstage at the Fitzgerald: A Music Companion" offers extended performances of 10 musical numbers and 6 "sponsor" sequences from the film. "Come Play with Us: A Feature Companion" (49 min) has 6 parts that take us through the history of the show, writing the film, filming, the all-star cast, and the music. Includes interviews with Garrison Keillor, Robert Altman, and cast. The "Soundtrack Preview" provides a track listing and some clips from the CD-DVD package. The audio commentary with director Robert Altman and actor Kevin Kline is worthwhile for Altman fans. Kline leads the commentary, which often turns into an interview with Altman. Kline gets a lot of information out of Altman about his approach to directing actors, camera work, and his reasoning in some scenes. Thanks to Kline for conducting an extended interview with Altman, as well as contributing his own observations, this is an interesting commentary. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish.</p></body></html>

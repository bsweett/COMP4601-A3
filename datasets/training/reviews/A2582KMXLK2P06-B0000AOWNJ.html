<meta name="summary" content="another October horror movie review"></head><body><p>The reason I believe the Ring is a classic horror movie is because it disturbs me on a VERY personal, unexplainable level.  You see, the main storyline of the Ring is the fact that this video tape has been created, and anyone who watches this video tape will die in some unusual, twisted manner.  It's up to a reporter woman named Rachel to figure everything out.  She's the main character of the film, along with her son.<br /><br />As I mention above, something very unusual about the film effects me in a way I can't explain.  First of all, the entire film is very effectively well-done the way everything is dark and damp and, for lack of better words, SCARY!<br /><br />The one thing I remembered after watching the Ring are some of the things that were on that video tape.  The mirror on the wall, and the location of the ladder are two things I could have SWORN I've seen somewhere before, like a childhood memory I can't figure out.  Like I've been SOMEWHERE and seen those things before.  Like the video tape used in the storyline actually existed before the film was released in 2003, and I believe I've actually SEEN the footage on that video tape many years ago *somewhere* because the sequence with the mirror and the ladder looked *incredibly* familiar.  I can't explain what it is but this is the main reason I find the movie so delightful.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not the Greatest Comic Book Adaptation, Not the Worst Either"></head><body><p>Nicholas Cage is Johnny Blade, stunt motorbike rider by profession. At night he turns `Ghost Rider' who has a burning skull, and rides a huge burning bike. Marvel's comic book character who signed a contract with the devil (played by Peter Fonda, nod to his "Easy Rider" role) comes with delightfully histrionic acting from wide-eyed Cage and corny one-liners and silly puns (including reference to `bonehead'). You may smile or just groan, but I loved the film for the silliness that I believe is intentional.<br /><br />I used the word `silliness' in a positive way. Obviously "Ghost Rider" is not trying to be `Spider-man" and its sequel, another film franchise based on Marvel comic with which many people would compare this film. I like Sam Raimi's films, but if you feel they are getting a bit too serious these days, maybe -- just maybe -- you like this film. Nicholas Cage's over-the-top performance as likeable Johnny Blade in modern Western film mood is fun for me and he is clearly enjoying playing this role while some may say his is plain bad acting.<br /><br />I don't mean to say "Ghost Rider" is a great film. The film is mostly fun, but it rarely gets emotionally involving. The romantic part of the story is weak and the pace is sometimes rushed and most supports are unmemorable. Wes Bentley's Blackheart and his minions are not strong and menacing enough to generate the really thrilling battle scenes. Eva Mendes appears as Johnny Blade's love interest, TV reporter holding a microphone before the camera, but she is not required to do more than that.<br /><br />The film turned better than I expected and I actually enjoyed watching the film for what it is - exaggerated styles and acting with lots of special effects, thinking at the same time, however, a better writer and director would have made it more enjoyable.</p></body></html>

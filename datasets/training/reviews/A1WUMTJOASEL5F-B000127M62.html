<meta name="summary" content="Mindless terror"></head><body><p>You would think that pitting against 2 of the most delightful frightmen known in the history of cinema mano y mano would have in turn created a mega movie yet unseen by man. What we get here is a lot of mindless action in a duel of the monster titans, and although Freddy retains his sarcastic reign, Jason comes across like a broken shell of a man, retaining none of his over power presence. What makes matters worse is the entire cast of onlookers & victims that mindlessly scream into the camera until you want them to shut up. Unlike its predecessors, the cast of young folk here are without charm, and for that matter, without coherence in their babble.<br />The major downfall here is you couldn't care less who survives, which makes the harrowing action around them completely meaninglessness in outcome. Therefore this movie fails at providing any real terror or even concern when putting these undesirables out of their misery could only be a benefit. Absolutely worthless venture.</p></body></html>

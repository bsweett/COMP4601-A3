<meta name="summary" content="Say what you will about this movie, but at least it has an ethos"></head><body><p>Like a lot of the Coen Brother's recent stuff, its whole is less than the sum of its parts, concerning itself with style rather than plot, and with witty, smirking dialog substituting for a storyline.  What keeps the movie going throughout a largely rudderless middle and ending is great dialog and acting.  When you have the Coen brothers writing and three of the best character actors in the business (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Steve Buscemi and John Turturro), you can't go too far wrong.  And the point of the movie -- life is too short to get stressed out -- is well-taken.<br /><br />Also, this movie is much better on multiple viewings.  If you saw it once and thought "eh - o.k. I guess" then I recommend watching it again.  It will improve the second time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Well done"></head><body><p>I was surprised at how well all the elements came together for this film. Obviously the main cohesion is centered on Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) and his relationship with his children, Scout (Mary Badham) and Jem (Philip Alford). I would classify this as one of Gregory peck's best movies. It almost had to be shot in black and whit to have the feel needed in the all but black and white movie.<br /><br />Scout and Jem know very little about their neighbor `Boo' (Robert Duvall.) They have heard and made up strange stories. They spend time daring each other and their summer friend, to go up to the neighbor house as it holds some mysterious crazed person. Through the movie many odd things happen such as a tree that mysteriously offers a series of objects from marbles to a watch, among other things. What do we really know about our neighbors?  Watch as the mystery unfolds. And what will they find out in this slice of life in the Depression-era South.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061205699">To Kill a Mockingbird (slipcased edition)</a></p></body></html>

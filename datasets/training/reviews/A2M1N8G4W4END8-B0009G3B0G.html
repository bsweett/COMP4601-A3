Suffering from bouts of amnesia, Jack drifts aimlessly around the country trying to find meaning for his recent experiences and his very existence.  After helping a young woman and her precocious daughter repair their stalled vehicle, Jack hitches a ride with a small-town good-ol'-boy.  Soon after--or at least as far as Jack's concerned it is soon after--Jack wakes up to find himself accused of murdering a police officer, an event for which he has absolutely no recollection.<br /><br />Jack is tried for the crime but declared innocent by reason of insanity, and the presiding judge subsequently sentences Jack to a mental hospital for the criminally insane.  It is there that resident shrink Dr. Thomas Becker (Kris Kristofferson) subjects Jack to a highly experimental treatment that involves the use of a mind-bending drug, a straightjacket, and a makeshift sensory-deprivation chamber (actually a cadaver drawer in the hospital morgue).  However, something unusual about Jack's mental configuration--the script is never explicit, but it is implied that Jack's war wound has altered his brain chemistry--causes him to time travel whenever he undergoes Dr. Becker's medical voodoo, and he always arrives in 2007 in the vicinity of a particular individual from his past.<br /><br />Each time he visits the future, Jack learns important information about the "present" that will help him to ultimately improve the lives of some of his acquaintances, as well as unravel the truth behind Dr. Becker's unorthodox treatments and thereby initiate the shrink's well-deserved downfall.<br /><br />Mystery and mind-bending puzzles abound in THE JACKET, and the film is one of those dark psychological thrillers that requires the audience to use its grey matter.  (Perhaps that is one reason it didn't fare so well at the box office?)  Yes, it does sometimes confuse and baffle, and the question of the reality (or lack thereof) of Jack's time-traveling trips isn't really answered until the final scene (or is it?).<br /><br />Director John Maybury and screenwriter Massy Tadjedin have together created a film that really defies categorization.  Cinema buffs will most certainly see elements and influences from such film greats as SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE (1972), ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST (1975), and TWELVE MONKEYS (1995), and it's not hard to discern the similarities to TV shows like THE TWILIGHT ZONE, THE OUTER LIMITS, and THE X-FILES. But it is still impossible to pigeon-hole THE JACKET.  Is it a science fiction flick? A drama?  An action thriller or a love story?  In truth, it is all these combined, and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />THE JACKET is replete with great visuals and has an interesting narrative style.  Best of all, it is populated with numerous interesting and accomplished actors.  Adrian Brody delivers a very affecting performance as the confused and angst-ridden protagonist Jack Starks.  He is able to relay intense emotion with facial expressions every bit as much as he can through dialogue, and this is important in a movie such as this.  Portraying the young woman who is the locus of Starks' trips into the future, Keira Knightley gives one of her very best performances to date, and the young Brit's American accent is dead on.  In supporting roles, Kris Kristofferson covers his Dr. Becker with a slimy patina that no other actor could as effectively create, and Jennifer Jason Leigh, as always, melts completely into her role and is quite convincing as the sympathetic and caring Dr. Lorenson.<br /><br />The DVD from Warner Home Video offers a crisp, clean digital transfer of THE JACKET in anamorphic widescreen at the film's original aspect ratio with very good Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.  Bonus features include a Project History featurette that includes deleted and restored shortened scenes, the original trailer, and a featurette that focuses on the special FX and visual design of the film.  All in all, this DVD is well worth the price of admission.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Solid "sequel" to "Superman II" has heart in the right place 4 stars"></head><body><p>First a confession--I really liked Richard Donner's first film. If you didn't like Donner's treatment of the subject you're not going to like this film and you're probably not going to like my review. Then you'll give me a "not helpful vote" and move on to express your opinion. For those who enjoyed Donner's film read on for those that didn't skip this film and go see "The Devil Wears Prada" or "X3" again.<br /><br />The film is certainly flawed. 1) It's too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes. It could easily have been cut by 40 minutes without damaging the story. 2) The pacing is off (which probably has a lot to do with the running time). The film builds to a climax and has to rebuild again when its defused. 3)The "Messiah" imagery is overused. Richard Donner's original film was flawed as well (it was too long and the whole sequence with Superman and Lois Lane flying could have been cut to a minute)so, in that respect, "Superman Returns" has a lot in common with Richard Donner's film and "Superman II" (the film to which this is a sequel). It's still darn good entertainment.<br /><br />Like "Superman" "Superman Returns" is fun populist entertainment. "Superman Returns" doesn't have the dark edge (nor despite what's been written a gay subtext) like "X-Men" or "X2" the two other superhero films that director Bryan Singer has made. It's pure, sweet and comic with some interesting themes and conflict. Sure it isn't the Superman of the comics nor of the TV series or cartoons but I didn't care then nor do I care now about that. The late Christopher Reeve was perfectly cast as Superman and even Margot Kidder worked well as the scattered Lois Lane. Donner's job was to reinvent Superman for a new audience.<br /><br />Bryan Singer's film captures the same qualities that made Donner's film so fun to begin with and he's stayed true (for the most part) to the 1978 film's mythology. The film isn't perfect (how could it be? It's a sequel to a film made nearly 30 years ago!)but it's darn good.<br /><br />**There are some minor spoilers ahead so you may want to skip this paragraph if you haven't seen the film.**<br /><br />Superman (newcomer Brandon Routh in a marvelous performance that captures elements of Reeve's while establishing the role as his own)has been absent for 5 years. When the location of Krypton was identified he decided to return and see if anything remained of his home world. Exposure to Kryptonite in space weakened him but he manages to return to the Kent farm after his absence and recovers with the help of his mother Martha (the great Eva Marie Saint). He also briefly recalls his youth when he first discovered his superpowers.<br /><br />He returns as Clark Kent to Metropolis and is rehired by Perry White (Frank Langella)only to discover that Lois (Kate Bosworth)has moved on with her life and has a five year boy and has won the Pulitzer Prizer for an editorial entitled "Why The World Doesn't Need Superman". Clearly she has issues with Supes. She's also taken up with Perry's nephew and the paper's associate editor Richard White (James Marsden from "X-Men" and "X-Men 2")living with him. The only one who seems to have missed him is Jimmy (Sam Huntington).<br /><br />Lex Luther (Kevin Spacey who fills Gene Hackman's shoes nicely bringing a deliciously evil edge to Lex)is free as Superman never showed during the parole hearings to argue for his incarceration. He has a plan and it involves in a perfect quotation from the original film, "land" and the death of billions. Lex returns to the Fortress of Solitude and learns everything he can about Superman and his lost world before stealing important artifacts.<br /><br />**End of Spoilers**<br /><br />Singer recreates the feel of the original film while bringing a look that is uniquely his own to the film with its marvelous art deco production design. The story written in collaboration with "X2" writers Michael Dougherty & Dan Harris (who also co-wrote the forthcoming remake of "Logan's Run")quotes liberally from both Donner's "Superman" (even using footage and recordings of Marlon Brando as Jor-El)and the George Reeves TV series (with cameos by Noel Neill and Jack Larson). Heck, Singer even throws in the iconic final shot from "Superman" and "Superman II" with Supes circling the Earth for good measure. It's clear that this film was a labor of love but also an attempt to examine a lot of themes that are essential to the Superman mythos including the Messiah myth as well as the unresolved love affair with Lois. Singer's direction of the actors is top notch. If the film is flawed its due to its running time--"Superman Returns" probably could have been trimmed by a good 20 minutes (much like Donner's "Superman")and worked just as well. Still all that screen time allows Singer to maximize the action set pieces (including a stunning robbery where Superman proves that bullets do indeed bounce off of him) without sacrificing the chararcter development.<br /><br />Routh manages to channel Reeve's winning performance as Superman/Clark Kent staying true to Reeve and Donner's(and writer Tom Mankiewicz's) interpretation of the character. Routh manages to inject enough of his own personality and make the character his own while still touching on Reeve's interpretation. Although Kate Kosworth's Lois might be a bit less kooky than Margot Kidder's take on the role she's as hard nosed a reporter and a bit more believable when it comes to helping Superman. James Marsden works well as the third part of this romantic love triangle as the new man in Lois' life. Kevin Spacey is brilliant as Lex much like Routh touching on Gene Hackman's performance but adding an edgy dangerous edge missing from Hackman's. Spacey's Lex is someone that you could believe would kill billions just to make a "killing" on a land deal.<br /><br />The visual effects are truly stunning and state of the art. The sequence involving the launch of the new space shuttle and its mishap is brilliantly realized. Much the same can be said for some of the other sequences involving the foiled robbery and the unexpectedly moving conclusion which refers to the Messiah myth and a recent Superman comic book.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" is a loving valentine to a film that Singer clearly respected and loved (heck he even uses John Williams "Superman" theme and the same opening title design as in the first film). I'd highly recommend "Superman Returns" for fans of the first two Chris Reeve films. It's populist filmmaking at its best tackling a number of challenging themes within the entertaining package of a superhero fantasy. The bottom line go see it for yourself don't read all these reviews and if you don't like it leave midway through the movie and ask for your money back. Vote with your money not based on someone else's opinion.</p></body></html>

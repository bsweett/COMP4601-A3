<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing"></head><body><p>The premise of the film wasn't bad, and the character of "Borat" is very entertaining but it just seemed to me to be unnecessarily vulgar. I was more impressed with the parts of the film that did NOT employ feces or incest as gag devices than with the film's efforts to "one-up" itself to see how much more tasteless it can get as the story unfolds. For instance, the elevator scene was pretty good and the discussion with the feminists was hilarious. But other parts just left me cold.<br /><br />A movie I like I can watch a dozen times. This one I could barely get through the first.</p></body></html>

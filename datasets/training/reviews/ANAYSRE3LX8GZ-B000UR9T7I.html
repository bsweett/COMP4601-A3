<meta name="summary" content="CGI Overkill"></head><body><p>I turned this off 10 minutes into the movie because the CGI overkill was making me sick. If they have a movie with a budget this big, and the fan base to support it, then write a decent script rather then trying to out-do Star Wars by using CGI for 99% of the movie and trying to add 1% plot around it.<br /><br />The movie might well have gotten better after the first half hour, but I will never know because I can not stand the useless and terrible looking CGI with actors who don't cast any shadow or light from their surroundings.<br /><br />Sometimes I can see past the bad CGI, but this one is just overkill, and was it really needed to tell anything in the story? The whole alley way surfboard scene just turned me off completely.<br /><br />I'm glad i didnt waste my money on this one.</p></body></html>

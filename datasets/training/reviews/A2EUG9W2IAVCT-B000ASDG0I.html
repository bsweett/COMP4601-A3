The funniest part is the elevator scene after Jolie and Pitt kick ass on the first floor of the department store and then get into the elevator and just wait while elevator music plays for the next floor.  Both actors give stellar performances as high octane, world-class spies who find out they are both each other's targets--their chemistry, already alleged during the filming of the movie, is more than obvious.  It's high adrenaline, high action, high comedic and high romantic.  Everything about this movie is uptempo and freakin' amazing.  Definitely a worthwhile buy.</p></body></html>

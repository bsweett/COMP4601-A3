<meta name="summary" content="Superman's return was not everything I'd hoped for."></head><body><p>The long-awaited SUPERMAN RETURNS is a good movie, but not a great one.<br /><br />To its credit, I can deeply appreciated keeping the homage to Richard Donner's original 1978 SUPERMAN, with John Williams' score, the soaring opening credits, Marlon Brando footage and Brandon Routh's similarities to the late Christopher Reeve, intact.  Hell, if you look carefully, you can even spot a picture of legendary actor Glenn Ford, who played Jonathon Kent in the original SUPERMAN.  The performances by all involved are more than fair, especially from Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor.<br /><br />Where SUPERMAN RETURNS fails, in my opinion, is the severe lack of action.  Except for the rescue of a jet airliner and bullets violently bouncing off of Superman's chest, the movie is filled with mostly visual wonderment and natural disaster (both of which we had plenty of in the original SUPERMAN).  I should also point out that the outcome of Lex Luthor (he ends up stranded on a deserted island with Parker Posey; who by the way, absolutely ruins the whole movie!  Who told her she could act???) is incredibly stupid.  Sorry for giving that one away.  Tough.<br /><br />So, all in all, Bryan Singer has nothing really new to offer his audience except for brand new actors.<br /><br />If you read up on the history of this project, you'll know that there was a time the studio was considering a script based on the 1992 comic book DEATH OF SUPERMAN.  Action-wise, that would have been much more spectacular!  Perhaps they'll consider it for the sequel.  He can die in that one and be resurrected for the third film.  Just like Spock in STAR TREK II and III.</p></body></html>

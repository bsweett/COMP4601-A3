It so effortlessly captured that sense of childlike innocence and wonder of seeing an impossible dream come to pass.  And if "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" doesn't quite reach that same level of wonderment, it is still a strange and wonderful ride, led by the always visually incomparable Tim Burton and his favorite foil Johnny Depp.  The film focuses, of course, on Willy Wonka (Depp) a brilliant but reclusive candy maker searching for an heir through an elaborate contest.  Five lucky children will discover a golden ticket hidden with their wonka bars, meaning they will tour Wonka's magical factory, not knowing that Wonka's sugary empire will be bequeathed to one of them. Most moviegoers will know the story by heart, but Burton, Depp and screenwriter John August put such a fresh spin on the tale that audiences will not mind seeing the old, familiar faces another time.<br /><br />One of those faces has always served as the crutch of the story: the well-meaning and earnest Charlie Bucket (a superb Freddie Highmore).  He is not strong or fast or tall, but he has a good heart, formed by the loving relationship with his family.  Much of the film's heart is found in the terrific rapport that Charlie has with his family, that include Helena Bonham Carter as his soft-spoken mother, Noah Taylor as his hard-working father, David Morris as the cantankerous Grandpa George and David Kelley as the feisty but big-hearted Grandpa Joe.  The early scenes featuring Charlie and his family are the best of the whole film, giving plenty of hearty laughs and strong  characters.  They all eagerly watch as four of Wonka's golden tickets are found by selfish and undeserving children before they joyously witness Charlie get his hands on the last one by sheer luck.<br /><br />Soon Charlie and his grandfather head to Wonka's factory with the other winners and tour the amazing and impeccably concieved Chocolate Factory.  Alex McDowells' colorful production design and Phillipe Rousselot's vivid cinematography are wonders unto themselves.  But more importantly it's here that we get our first good look at Depp as Wonka.  His performance is a radical departure from Gene Wilder's original portrayal.  Depp's Wonka is self-exile from society due to problems with his dentist daddy (Christopher Lee) disowning him for being a choclatier.  Depp's performance works a little too well at first.  He's distant from the gaggle touring his factory but he's also a a little removed from the audience, who are bound to be caught off-guard by his overtly weird turn as Wonka.  But give Depp and Burton time.  The character grows and starts to emerge from his shell as the movie goes along, aided by great moments of off-kilter humor and Burton's extraordinary visuals, leading to a sweetly satisfying conclusion that never comes off syrupy.</p></body></html>

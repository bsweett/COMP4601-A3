<meta name="summary" content="Great movie, but chronologically confusing."></head><body><p>I finally got around to watching this one over the weekend, and although I enjoyed it immensely, I have to give it a mixed review.  Now admittedly, I haven't read the book yet -- it's been sitting on my shelf waiting for me to get to it for far too long -- so I'll do my mea culpa right now if the answers to my concerns are already duly explained.<br /><br />The most glaring issue for me was, where does this movie fit chronologically with the other Jack Ryan films?  It starts with a background scene from the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, and then jumps to "29 years later", which means the main story would be set in 2002.  However, instead of the "married with children" Jack Ryan that we saw in "Patriot Games" and "Clear and Present Danger", we find a young, single Jack Ryan (played by Ben Affleck) who is still essentially an unknown nobody at the CIA.  We also get introduced to a similarly youthful Jack Clark, of "Rainbow Six" fame.  I'm not sure if these anachronistic gymnastics were intentional or not, but I found it more than a bit distracting as I watched this film.  To borrow a phrase from Kelly Bundy, the whole thing "wobbles the mind."<br /><br />Aside from that, though, it was a typical Tom Clancy technothriller, chock full of high suspense from start to finish.  This one resurrects the spectre of nuclear warfare between the U.S. and post-Soviet Russia after a neo-Fascist terror cell unleases a low-yield nuke in Baltimore, then sets about to make it look like it was a Russian attack.  As predicted, the U.S. response only serves to up the ante until the two nations stand teetering at the brink of mutual annihilation.<br /><br />In the meantime, the young Jack Ryan follows his uncanny instincts to unravel the puzzle in a fast-paced, action-filled plot line that never eases up the tension.  The special effects for the nuclear blast are very well done indeed.  However, the sight of Ryan traipsing around near ground zero apparently without any harmful side effects from the radiation is just a teensy oversight in the realism department.<br /><br />Overall I cannot say I was at all disappointed by these above lapses, just puzzled.  The story itself was, as are all the Clancy films, gripping and suspenseful.  Definitely a good movie.</p></body></html>

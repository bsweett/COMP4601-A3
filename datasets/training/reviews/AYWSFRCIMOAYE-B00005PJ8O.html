It`s so convincing that it glued me to the chair from the beginning till the end. It touches me deeply because Patton was revealed as a human being with both strength and weaknesses. From what I learnt from history books, the movie contains many facts too.<br /><br />This is one of the few movies that leaves a long lasting impression on me. No wonder, it won 7 Oscars in 1970 including the best picture.<br /><br />In short, it`s one the best that my money can get in terms of biography movies.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fairy tale of loss"></head><body><p>If there ever was a movie that made me cry, this is the one.  This is how fairy tales are supposed to be told.  They teach us many lessons, on many different levels, and unlike Disney movies they do not always have a happy ending.  Perhaps that is the reason why many critics have labeled this film as "fairy tale for adults" - I guess those same critics assume that children are to be sheltered from tales of loss and death.  Well - I disagree with that but then again, I grew up reading brother Grimms' fairy tales too.  Beautiful movie with beautiful special effects and story about hope lost in search of eternal (parental) love.  Set in Franco's Spain film also addresses the horror of fasicm and inability of a yound girl to supress the misery that comes with it.  Film shows us that evil affects all of us, but children have a special way of dealing with it - their imagination transcends the harsh reality and guides them to the world of magic full with most astonishing secrets only child can embrace with no reservations.  Absolutely beautiful -- and heartbreaking!</p></body></html>

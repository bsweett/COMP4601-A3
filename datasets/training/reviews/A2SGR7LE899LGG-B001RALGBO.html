The storyline was cliche' but stll pretty good overall (I seen much worse recently) and the science was very Hollywood but loosely accurate. The global warimng issue is very real as well as other topics (money is god). Overall I enjoyed this film and I will be getting it on DVD when it comes out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nemesis of My Eye"></head><body><p>I had stayed clear of this film mainly on recommendations of others, but when the Special Collectors Edition Series came along, I could hardly resist it. As Sci Fi Films go its not bad, but as a Star Trek film goes, I'll take a Captain Kirk film any day. I thought the basic story line was quite good, in the sci fi sense, but a total goose in the Star Trek Sense. Its not hard to  see why things went to horribly bad in the film, the director, as well as the principal writer were all non-trek oriented ( the main writer did admit to being a "Trekkie" however, when his idea<br />of advancing a plot was the glasses in Star Trek 2 that Bones gave to Kirk, then somethings wrong), also you can see how much of a heavy hand the Studio had in the edits with the deleted scenes... some of the most "Star Trek" styled moments just got the chop. Nemesis is a Good Sci-Fi film, but a superb example of how a franchise film is wrecked in the "do a film by Committee" style of film making that has so successfully killed many films.<br /><br />THE DVD: Great Extras. Lots of informative material in the commentaries, and in the disc 2 extras. Great to see Ron Perlman out of Makeup and without his digitally enhanced voice as Vice-Roy ( which he plays in NEMESIS).Very Good Collection of Interviews and lookbacks.</p></body></html>

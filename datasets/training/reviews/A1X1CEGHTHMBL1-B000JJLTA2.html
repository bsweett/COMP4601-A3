<meta name="summary" content="A fairly good movie that is good for an entertainment movie evening with the family!"></head><body><p>I like movies that involve people with super abilities and supernatural talents.  This movie sort of hit the warm spot in my heart with good entertainment and action at the same time.  It is based on a comic book series but the storyline has been changed and it is based in the late 1800's.  The super heroes are based on the characters developed by H. G. Wells, Bram Stoker, Jules Verne and many more famous authors so you have a combination of super heroes and villains.  It sort of uses an alternate history where the German soldiers are involved in a series of raids on both British and German facilities.  Someone is trying to start a war between Germany and Britain.  Alan Quatermain (Sean Connery) is reluctantly recruited to help find out what is going on and stop a potential war.<br /><br />A team of super powerful beings are recruited to investigate and solve the mystery.  That is where the real problems begin....<br /><br />This is a high action movie with a lot of good stars and the story line is that the super heroes are supposed to stop the bad guy from conquering the world.  The special effects are pretty good and some of the actors did a very good job in their roles.  I don't want to ruin the movie for you by giving out too many spoilers so you will just have to watch it and enjoy it.  I liked the movie and it is a good family movie with the popcorn bowl being passed around.</p></body></html>

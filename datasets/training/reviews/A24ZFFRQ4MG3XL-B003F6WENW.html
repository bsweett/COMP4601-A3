The biggest negative it had going for it, was what happens to all great movies - and that is TV commercials and movie commercials showing all the best and most funny parts ahead of time.  When you get to the cinema or see the dvd, nothing is funny anymore.  I didn't laugh much outside of all the good parts because they had been hashed on tv over and over.  That being said, I did laugh once or twice else and those parts were due to Will Farrell.  He's hillarious and has a cute cameo in this.  I thought overall that Vince Vaughn stole the movie.  He was terrific and so funny.  He had the worst luck throughout the movie, whether it be a hand job under the table with the girl he can't stand to be around, or the brother of said girl entering his bedroom and bed.  Owen Wilson was great too, also having his share of bad luck.  Imagine the mother of the girl you like, exposing herself to you.  He handled himself well under the pressure.  I did expect more from Christopher Walken; I thought he wasn't half as good as many of his other roles and didn't have any great lines or scenes.  That was a big disappointment.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is very good (maybe not quite worth all the hype that followed it), and the acting is great and has perfect timing. It has one of the most predictable endings, but put that aside and you have a funny movie to watch and a new dvd for your collection.</p></body></html>

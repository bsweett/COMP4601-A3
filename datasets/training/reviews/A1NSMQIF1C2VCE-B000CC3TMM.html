<meta name="summary" content="Lacks most of what made the first movie great"></head><body><p>Jason Statham is perhaps the coolest guy in action movies today, and is a gritty and compelling (anti-)hero, even in this, a movie that might as well be written for Jackie Chan.<br /><br />And that's the problem with Transporter 2: Where the original had a European flavor unfamiliar to American audiences, and fights that, although clever, mostly made audience's teeth ache in sympathy, the sequel is lightweight, silly and it even has a cute kid.<br /><br />Statham looks lost here, among the lame jokes and bad CGI effects. If there's a third Transporter, hopefully it will get back to the cross-country, bone-crunching, somewhat edgy tone of the original.<br /><br />A rental for fans of the original, but nothing more.</p></body></html>

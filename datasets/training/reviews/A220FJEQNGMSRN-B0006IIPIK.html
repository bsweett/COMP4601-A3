Unfortunately, the two-tone, almost sepia color and the excessive diffusion of the image tends to bleed the film of vitality at times and does no favors whatsoever to Gwyneth Paltrow, who looks absolutely terrible throughout the film (the fact that her performance is not just bad but plain unlikeable much of the time doesn't help: small wonder that Angeline Jolie steals the film from her). Kerry Conran does manage to recreate some of the visual style of the old Max and Dave Fleischer Superman cartoons (Mechanical Monsters in particular), but without their vivid three-strip Technicolor, and he gives good montage. Unfortunately, he's better at visual design than directing actors or action - this should be a lot more fun than it actually is. Jude Law is a particularly weak hero, lacking steel or much in the way of charisma, once again proving that he's a better character actor in supporting roles than a credible leading man. It's watchable enough and the big undersea dogfight shows how much better it could have been, but never draws you in and carries you along enough to be as much fun as it wants to be. And if you're going to use footage of Laurence Olivier to `play' the villain, at least find a voice double who actually sounds like him!</p></body></html>

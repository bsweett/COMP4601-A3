<meta name="summary" content="An entertaining yet hollow look at the Revolution..."></head><body><p>I remember when I first saw this film, about two days after my wedding.  My wife and I were lounging around the house for a week before we left for our honeymoon and so we spent a lot of time watching movies.  Well, we never really say through a movie in it's entirety and so, a few years later, I found that I didn't really remember anything about this movie (outside of that gory hatchet murder scene).<br /><br />So I watched it again.<br /><br />The thing for me is that `The Patriot' is just not that great.  There are a lot of films that circulate this genre, and you really have to stand up tall to be taken seriously.  For me (and I understand that everyone is entitled to their own opinion), this movie hardly stands tall enough.<br /><br />This is sad, because the performances here are all very, very good, at times broaching on fantastic.  I am not a big Mel Gibson fan (in fact, I've only really ever lauded him in `Ransom') but I felt that he was outstanding here, truly balancing the political, emotional and parental aspects of this man.  He found the grit within the script and used it to bring this character to life before our eyes.  Heath Ledger (R.I.P.) is also wonderfully used here.  He had just started building his career in 2000 and this is one of those performances that makes you stand back and take notice.  Tom Wilkinson is always great (I love that man) and even though he doesn't have a huge role, his scenes are brilliantly executed.  Even the token villain role is given an extra push through the eyes of Jason Isaacs, who chews scenery like you wouldn't believe, yet not in that regrettably clich&eacute;d way.<br /><br />But, the films plot, which is little more than a revenge drama, takes this film down a few notches for me.  Unlike `Gladiator', which came out this very same year and used a similar plot structure (to drastically superior effect), `The Patriot' doesn't seem to be able to use that element to its benefit.  Instead, it comes off rather elementary and hollow.<br /><br />The films direction is effective, and the battle scenes (while nothing overly impressive) are very well crafted.  The savagery of certain scenes (like the aforementioned hacking) is also used in an effective and memorable fashion, and the cinematography adds layers of beauty to the films gritty core.  It is entertaining (although I did find that it tended to drag in parts) but it falls short of being anything truly remarkable, despite all that it has going for it.<br /><br />BTW, I'm not a history buff, and I don't pretend to be, so the historical inaccuracies that many have called this film out for don't really bother me (in fact, I didn't even really notice them).  For me, this film wasn't claiming to be a history lesson (which was part of the problem, since the clich&eacute;d `revenge' formula should have been ditched for a more astute look at the war) so I didn't pick it apart for not being one.</p></body></html>

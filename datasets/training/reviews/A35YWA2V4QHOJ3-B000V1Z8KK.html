<meta name="summary" content="Rogue Marine"></head><body><p>A patriotic Marine sniper named Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) is set up by his own government as a fall guy for a foiled(?) assasination attempt on the president.  Pre-Bush 43, a plot like this would have been considered far-fetched.  Thanx to Dubya & his corrupt administration, a plot such as this would nowadays be considered par-for-the-course inside the beltway!<br /><br />The only person in the world who is able to help Swagger is the bride of his dead spotter (played by Rhona Mitra).  After enlisting her help, he shows the bad guys (led, surprisingly, by an outside-the-norm role for Danny Glover) that it's best not to mess around with a Marine sniper!<br /><br />I know it's based on a book, but for me the film had a lot of motifs / overtones of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W07EKW">The Jason Bourne Collection (The Bourne Identity / The Bourne Supremacy / The Bourne Ultimatum)</a>.  Problem is, Mark Wahlberg is no where near as good an actor as Matt Damon.  He lacks Damon's powerful screen presence, and simply isn't up to the task of the character he is attempting to portray.<br /><br />The highlight of the cast would be Rhona Mitra as a simple country girl who lives in Kentucky.  She is absolutely positively perfect as the Bluegrass sweetheart!  She even speaks with a southern accent, which is something you don't hear in most Hollywood movies.  I was a bit surprised that she's the same woman who played the role in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN697M">Underworld: Rise of the Lycans</a> as the roles are so different. This is a very dynamic actress!<br /><br />In summary, this is a film that was good, but could've been better with a superior actor in the lead role.  It does make you suspend your disbelief on some things from time-to-time, but that's all well & good in thrillers such as this one.</p></body></html>

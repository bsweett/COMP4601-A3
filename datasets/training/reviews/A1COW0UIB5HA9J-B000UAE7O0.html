<meta name="summary" content="Fast, furious and rockin' zombie flick!"></head><body><p>A deadly military experiment is accidently released as a gas turns some of the soliders into vicious flesh-eating mutant zombie-esque ghouls that begin to spread a virus through their bite that can turn people into the same creatures. Sexy stripper Cherry Darling (Rose Mcgowan) whom just got her leg ripped apart by those creatures joins forces with a maverick (Freddy Rodriguez), a female smuggler (Naveen Andrews), a restraunt owner (Jeff Fahry) and a female doctor (Mary Shelton) as they must battle every one of those abominations and find out what is behind all this madness.<br /><br />Co-starring Bruce Willis, Tom Savini, Quentin Tarantino and Josh Brolin this is an electrifying and funny Sci-fi horror action packed rollercoaster ride of a film. Writer-director-producer Robert Rodriguez ("Sin City", "Desperado", "El Mariachi" and "From Dusk Till Dawn") with producer and co-star Quentin Tarantino have conjured up the best of the two stories on 2007's experimental cinematic flick "Grindhouse". It's got lots of great performances including some 70's 16mm style grainy filming including a brief missing reel part to make it seem like the audience is in a grindhouse theater, i also love how the heroine in this movie is very sexy yet original as she's like no other heroine to hit film before yet she kicks ace. This movie is loaded with non-stop action and graphic scenes of gore such as castration, cannibalism, exploding heads, brains exposed including everything but the kitchen sink.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray set offers awesome surround picture and sound that will rock your home-theater as it's presented in it's uncut and extended version with footage not shown in theaters. There's some great extras like audio commentary, audience reaction track, Trailer, additional scratch free version, BD-live, 10 minute film school featurette, featurettes, reel of casting and poster gallery.<br /><br />Also recommended: "Night of the Living Dead (1968 and 1990)", "Re-Animator", "Dawn of the Dead (1978 and 2004)", "Day of the Dead (1985)", "Return of the Living Dead 1 2 and 3", "The Hills Have Eyes (2006)", "Dead Alive (a.k.a.

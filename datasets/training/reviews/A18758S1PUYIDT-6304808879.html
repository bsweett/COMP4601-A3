<meta name="summary" content="silly humans and some cheesy effects"></head><body><p>The blood is too thick and gooey, the skin with hooks in it is very obviously latex, and the Cenobite with the shades is more goofy than scary.<br />Also, I must point out the silliness of some of these humans and of the plot elements:<br />1.  Why did the pleasantly bland fellow get remarried to such a horrible woman?<br />2.  If you see that your dad's head is bleeding for no apparent reason, wouldn't you immediately assume that something is terribly wrong?<br />3.  Who the heck moves into a house with rats and bad plumbing when they don't have to?<br />4.  Why is the word "Cenobite" never really explained?<br />5.  When a homeless guy comes into your place of business and starts eating bugs, wouldn't you call the police?<br /><br />And so on.<br /><br />There's such a fine line between silly and scary, isn't there?</p></body></html>

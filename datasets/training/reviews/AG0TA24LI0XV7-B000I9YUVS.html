<meta name="summary" content="Aaaargh...I roll me eyes in disgust, matey"></head><body><p>If their goal in 2005 was to remake a decent, creepy ghost movie from 1980 and make it incredibly boring and stupid, then they have a huge success here.<br />Granted, John Carpenter's "The Fog" (the original) may not be as good as Robert Wise's "The Haunting" (1963) or Alejandro Amenabar's "The Others" (2001)... but I like it. It's a fun film to watch because it works. The story/screenplay, the music, and the performances seem to blend well and create a fun macabre movie.<br /><br />The creators of Halloween (1978) needed to follow up that project with something else, and they chose a more traditional and gothic tale of supernatural horror. They could have gone the 'teens stalked by slasher' route again. It's good that they didn't. (Of course they would do that again in the Halloween sequel. With the success of the first movie who could blame them?)<br /><br />This version of The Fog is not fun like the original, nor is it in any way truly scary... even though it is obvious that the director and screenwriter probably felt that they made a frightening flick. Well, they didn't. They use all the typical, tried-and-false methods that we expect from horror films. Give us something unexpected instead of this nonsense! Life is brief and I am tired of wasting time on shoddy movies that stink.<br /><br />And they altered the story significantly, for the worse. Why tamper with something that was fine?<br />At least the original film had an atmosphere of impending dread and creepiness (and a very effective score by Mr. Carpenter). But Hollywood cannot leave well enough alone. Sometimes I think that there ought to be a law against remakes. Rarely does this concept succeed.<br /><br />So if you have watched every other film ever created, and if have run out of good books to read, and if you have nothing whatsoever else to do, then you might consider watching this dreck that came up from the bottom of the sea. Chances are when it's over you will want to watch the original film and see an enjoyable and chilling ghost tale unfold.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="People might be expecting too much"></head><body><p>Based on many of the reviews I have read, I think people were expecting much more from this possibly because Hoffman and Streisand were in it. With a title like this, you should go in expecting an easy to watch film with a few laughs. And it does just that.  I must admit, I went in expecting the worse based on the reviews, but it surpassed my expectations.  Meet the Fockers is very easy to sit through, doesn't make you look at your watch, and it has some great laughs (even if they are rather crude). Everyone enjoys a film from time to time which doesn't require too much thought.<br /><br />Hoffman, Streisand and De Niro steal the show for sure. Stiller isn't too bad as the son embarrassed by his parent's behaviour. My advice:  Do not to take it seriously, just enjoy it.  It is a good value 3 star film ... no more, no less.</p></body></html>

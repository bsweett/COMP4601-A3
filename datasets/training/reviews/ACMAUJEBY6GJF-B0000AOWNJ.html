These movies aren't good for my health, including "The Grudge". And yes, I'm man enough to admit it -and my girlfriend having long black hair didn't exactly help it! Hehe, it's not that bad of course, but "The Ring" indeed is the movie that managed to scare the peace out of me for the rest of that day, and with its' flaws (the tape that's never explained where comes from or how was "produced") -well, the movie managing to do so well what it intends to do I DON'T CARE! A masterpiece of its' genre, "Halloween" or "Nightmare On Elm Street" will never be the same after this!<br /><br />Creepy!</p></body></html>

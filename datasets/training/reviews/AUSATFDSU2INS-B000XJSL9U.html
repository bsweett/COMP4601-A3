After bringing his most famous character back to life, I'm happy to say that he's made a good decision and long time fans won't be disappointed with the new film: Live Free or Die Hard.<br /><br />The movie is a runaway success: the notable lack of CGI and very high stunt factor give the film a satisfying old-fashioned feel. There's also a lot of fun to be had in Die Hard 4.0 and that fun starts with Bruce Willis himself. His McClane is still pounding the streets but his hair has all gone. The script makes plenty of fun at McClane advancing years.<br /><br />The plot, of course, is overblown and predictable and I won't even dwell in an explanation that will leave us with more questions than answers. In short: A new villain is threatening to shut down America's power supplies. Only one man can stop him (we know who), and McClane is helped by a young computer hacker (Justin Long) to stop the potential armaggedon.<br /><br />What follows is one fantastically realized chase sequence or fight sequence or both after another, as McClane battles the baddies and gets progressively more torn up with each passing minute. But this is John McClane, so we know he ain't dying anytime soon.<br /><br />Each stunt outdoes the next, and the filmmakers don't waste a lot of time on little things like dialogue. Any talking is short and sweetened with one-liners. Director Len Wiseman keeps the action and humour coming thick and fast, but this is Bruce's show - and he doesn't disappoint.</p></body></html>

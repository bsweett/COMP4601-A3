<meta name="summary" content="Army Of Darkness, is it the End?  Maybe not..."></head><body><p>Army of Darkness was presumably the last of the Evil Dead movies, allowing, for what many fans thought, a final glimpse of the beloved anti-hero Ash.  Lighter in tone (as in it's basically a Horror/Comedy) and far less reliant on gross out makeup effects than the previous two films, Army of Darkness nevertheless stands its own as a classic Horror film.  Showcasing the amazing acting talent of Bruce Campbell by putting his character, Ash,  into hilarious and horrifying situations (ie. demons in a pit, mini-demented versions of himself in a twisted Liliputian attack, hundreds upon hundreds of skeletons, and three, yes three, Necronomicons!) Army of Darkness was for many fans a bittersweet end to a fantastic series, or was it?  <p>With the upcoming release of the Evil Dead videogame (you get to play Ash!) and many rumors of a fourth movie (please God, let it be true!) as well as a recent interview with Sam Raimi in Fangoria magazine where he openly expresses his wishes to helm a fourth Evil Dead film it seems Evil Dead fans greatest desire may quite possibly come true.  In the Fangoria interview Raimi cited his busy schedule, the lackluster box office receipts of the first 3 films, and the lack of an existing script as some minor hurdles to creating a fourth film.  As an Evil Dead fan I can vouch that I'd be right there on opening day if the film were made and I know every other Evil Dead fan would be there too.  I know the home video sales of the first 3 films have been phenomenal and that might be tantalizing enough to film producers to back the project.  I hope.  <p>If it has to be, Army of Darkness will stand as a good enough ending to the series, the movie is a fun experience and eternally re-watchable.  But Evil Dead fans want more, dammit!  And a fourth movie would be just &quot;Groovy&quot;!</p></body></html>

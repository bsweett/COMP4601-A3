Cheadle's character Paul Rusesabagina is a really, really good and calm four-star hotel manager. And he was able to channel his skills at pleasing guests into improbably saving a thousand refugees during a massacre that Western civilization essentially ignored.<br /><br />Sophie Okonedo plays Rusesabagina's wife Tatiana, a member of the Tutsi tribe that faces extinction in the massacre. Together Tatiana and Paul - a member of the Hutu tribe - work despite incredible odds to cope with this tragedy and save their family and endangered community.<br /><br />Okonedo and Cheadle's most powerful scenes, though, come when the Rusesabaginas are forced to discuss what to do should their family be slaughtered. The actors are able to juxtapose the very real love that this husband and wife felt for one another with the absolute horror that they could die at any moment under a machete. One scene on a rooftop reduced me to tears.<br /><br />There are several bigger-name white actors in the film, namely Nick Nolte, Jean Reno and Joaquin Phoenix, who are able to pull the viewers in, but they are pushed to the sidelines as the story continues.<br /><br />Cheadle carries the film. He's in almost every scene, and he's magnificent.<br /><br />But the story of this genocide is horrifying. Though the film isn't unnecessarily bloody, it's a difficult movie to watch, even though the story is a great one.</p></body></html>

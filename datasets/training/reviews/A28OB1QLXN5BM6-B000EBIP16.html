<meta name="summary" content="I waited 35 years for this movie..."></head><body><p>And I was not disappointed.  Disney got it right.  They actually made the movie I have been waiting for most of my life.<br /><br />I have read the classic book, The Lion, the Witch, and The Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis, literally dozens and dozens of times, and I believe that this film is destined to become a classic in its own right. It is a family oriented movie that stays quite true to the original story. A warning to the purists, the are a few minor name changes, for some reason.<br /><br />This movie is excellent, entertaining, and enjoyable on all levels: phenomenal special effects and make-up; breathtaking cinematography; and, of course, top-notch performances.  Performances in this film are across the board superior, extremely expressive, and display a wide range of emotions.<br /><br />The plot is complete, and, as stated earlier, it matches book almost perfectly. It is fast-paced and action-packed; a thrilling ride from beginning to end.  It was truly worth the wait.</p></body></html>

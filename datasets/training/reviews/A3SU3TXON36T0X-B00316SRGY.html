<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Film.  Really the best I've seen in a long time."></head><body><p>Gran Torino (2008) is a movie that is so brazenly anti-p.c. that I am surprised it was even made.  The movie shows the reality of gang warfare and the futility of trying to stand up to these thugs.  The epithet hurling Eastwood finds he has more in common with the hard-working and tradition-based Hmung than with the sniveling whiners who make up his own family.  Eastwood's character takes on the young boy "Toad" and teaches him important lessons.  The best scene in the movie occurs when Eastwood appears with a gun and tells the gang of street thugs to "Get off my lawn!".  It shows real attitude.  Anyone who has ever stepped out of the ivory tower long enough to witness the operations of these types of gangs can certainly appreciate this.  Ultimately the film features an epic showdown in which Eastood must take on the gang harassing Tao's family.  There is little left for him but to be put into an old-folk's home by his own superficial and parisitic family or to go out fighting.  As always, Eastwood chooses the tough guy's way.</p></body></html>

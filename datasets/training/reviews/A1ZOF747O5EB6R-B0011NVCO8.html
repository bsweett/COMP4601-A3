It has been apparently overlooked for Oscar nominations and this is both a surprise and a mistake.<br /><br />The film is set in the late sixties and early seventies and covers police corruption in the exercise of drug enforcement in the New York City area.  The apex of this corruption is Frank Lucas, as played by Denzel Washington, who is a smooth but thoroughly brutal importer of heroin directly from the golden triangle.  He distributes favours and skilfully supports a web of personnel based mainly in Harlem.  He manages to largely slide under the radar until he is spotted in ring side seats at the Ali versus Frazier fight in Madison Square Garden.  How is this "no one" able to have such a seat?  Who is he?  It is at this point that his world begins to unravel.<br /><br />The forces for law are led by Richie Roberts, played by Russell Crowe, who is an apparently incorruptible cop based in New Jersey.  He is relentless in his pursuit of Lucas even though this has personal consequences.  In the end, he gets his man.  He also manages to implicate a vast swathe of his fellow law enforcers.  Lucas's network extends far and deep.<br /><br />I found this film to be absolutely enthralling.  It moves languidly until interspersed and confronting violence drags the viewer's attention back to the forces at work.  Washington and Crowe are great in their roles.  The support cast is commendable and the soundtrack is powerful as it evokes images of the late sixties and the era of Vietnam against which backdrop the film evolves.  I can thoroughly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

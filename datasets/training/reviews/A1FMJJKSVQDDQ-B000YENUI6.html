These past years, we've been tortured by three family-friendly High School Musical films, poor comedies like The Love Guru, teenage garbage such as 13 Going on 30, sappy fantasies like Eragon, etc. But hey, at least many of the action films were good to watch. Even though I'm in my early 20's, I'm a bit saddened that today's generation has ignored many classic films such as The Godfather and 2001: A Space Odyssey. And come on, The Dark Knight is a great movie and all, but it shouldn't be the ONLY film to watch in your lifetime! However, there is still hope. We have seen excellent movies from 2000 to present. No Country for Old Men, Donnie Darko, Hot Fuzz and Letters from Iwo Jima are just a few. One of them I particularly enjoyed watching straight through is Eastern Promises. It's not only one of the few films in this generation that's strictly for ADULTS, but it's also one of the two darkest and most violent thrillers of 2007 (right next to No Country For Old Men).<br /><br />This film starring Viggo Mortensen and Naomi Watts is a relief from all the politically correct films we've seen for some time. There are some downright disturbing stuff going on. Anna Khitrova (Watts), who works at a hospital, has been informed that a fourteen-year old girl has just died of childbirth. She finds the girl's diary and discovers the painful truth: the girl named Tatiana was part of a notorious Russian prostitution ring, and that the ones who are partly responsible are right here in London. Mortensen, Vincent Cassel, and Armin Mueller-Stahl play the "thieves in law" who try to make sure that the truth is never revealed to the authorities.<br /><br />And it's not only the plot that's disturbing. There are scenes in which blood and gore takes center stage (the infamous bathhouse scene, for example). And there are plenty of major plot twists (if you want to know what they are, then watch the film). Mortensen was perfectly cast as Nikolai. He avoids the "Lord of the Rings" typecasting and goes on to act with a very good Russian accent. Watts gives a lovely performance as Anna; I could see no one else playing the part. Cassel as Kiril looks to be someone you would love to hate at first, but when the film nears its end, you can't really tell if you really do. Mueller-Stahl as Semyon is definitely the one we would love to hate, and he does a hell of a job at that. The supporting cast have it down good, also, so no complaints here.<br /><br />The reason I watched Eastern Promises was because I have a deep interest in Russian history, culture, and mythology. This clearly exceeded my expectations. It's one of the best films of 2007. It's too bad, though, that some people of this generation won't be very pleased when they get a chance to see this, because it's so dark and disturbing. Well, it's safe to say that I admire the film, and I hope there will be another film this year that will be as stupendous as this one.<br /><br />Grade: A+</p></body></html>

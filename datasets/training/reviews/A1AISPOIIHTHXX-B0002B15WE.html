<meta name="summary" content="Why can't action movies be like this today?"></head><body><p>If there's one thing that sort of bugs me about the whole action genre is that they are incredibly formulaic and a lot of times you can almost guess where everything is going to happen. Well, to be fair Die Hard doesn't try to re-invent the wheel although nowadays whenever an action movie comes out, it's usually billed as "Die Hard on a something". You may see everything coming but damned if it isn't fun anyways.<br /><br />John McClane is a New York City cop visiting his wife on Christmas Eve in Los Angeles. The 2 aren't on the best of terms and he's meeting her at the office building where she works and decide how to spend Christmas. Of course no sooner does he arrive that a group of terrorists led by Hans Gruber take hostages and try to get into a vault. Luckily John avoided capture and has to figure out how to save the hostages as well as his own skin all by himself.<br /><br />Granted as you can tell, it's probably not the most original plot but what it does with it is the key thing here as the film rarely slows down. I know it's cliche to say that "the film gets going and never stops till the end!" and there are some slower parts but there's a sense of tension running through the whole thing that makes more interesting and not just filler between the action scenes. It's really the editing that makes the film exciting since, like Speed, the film never gets sluggish.<br /><br />And of course the big draw was Bruce Willis and it's funny that the actor was once best known as the guy on that Moonlighting show from the 80's yet we see him as an action star and it's not hard to see why. Physically fit yet with a sense of humor, McClane isn't some humorless guy who makes awful one-liners now and then (Steven Segal, Van Damme) that makes it easier to root for him. And of course no hero can be without a villain and who better than Alan Rickman, probably best known for either this role or as Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series. What makes these two work is that they don't seem like enemies who meet for one night but the interplay and battle of wits is what makes them stand out.<br /><br />While the film feels "80's" a lot, it's still nonetheless an engaging movie for those who are finding the recent action films a little lacking.</p></body></html>

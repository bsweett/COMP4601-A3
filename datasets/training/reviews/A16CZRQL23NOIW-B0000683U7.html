<meta name="summary" content="A suspense divertimento!"></head><body><p>You must have realized all the previous films with Grant as actor the suspense and the humour were joined . From Suspicious , Catch a thief and obviously this one could not be the exception of the rule<br /><br />Hitchcock always knew to show the other side of the actor , specially if he was a renowned and glamorous star . And the best proof is Charade where Stanley Donnen called again to Grant to make a love affair beneath a soft anguish thriller.<br /><br />In this opportunity , Hitchcock reached a goal employing symbols of power . From Mount Rushmore to the United Nations building , the vertiginous camera movements make of this tongue in cheek spy thriller an outstanding exercise of narrative agility , a bit of fine british humour here and there and very unusual film .<br /><br />You could not establish this film among the top suspense films but a smart story spattered of irony and cynicism blending two raising and even fashion professions such spies in the Cold War with the world of the advertising  business .<br /><br />Have you realized the hidden homage to this film made in From Russian with love in the fumigator airplane chase?<br /><br />The unbridled rhythm , the prodigious musical score of Bernard Hermann and superb locations plus the adequate use of the colour deserved for this washed face cold war film a nomination to Original Script (Ernest Lehman), Set up and Decoration .<br /><br />An original and unforgettable film from the Supreme Suspense Magician.<br /><br />And please don't forget the known statement of Schopenhauer : About what it is said in society , the important is to be funny , the lesser aspect is its veracity .</p></body></html>

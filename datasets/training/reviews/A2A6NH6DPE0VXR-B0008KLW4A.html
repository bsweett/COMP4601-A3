That never got off the ground though and stupidly Warner Brothers decided to do it without Selena Kyle. It bugged a lot of comic fans that they'd do it without even having the character from the comic. It's not even original either, she even becomes Catwomen the same way Pfeiffer did in Batman Returns. Plus it's played out like Halle Berry has 2 peronalities and she has no control what she does when she has on the costume. Which is pretty silly and doesn't work. Plus the direction is done like a music video, hell think the director even started out making music videos. The action is too fast and messy looking to even be entertaining. Not one once of the action scenes even look realistic.<br /><br />  I always thought that if Michelle Pfeiffer wouldn't come back that Sharon Stone could replace her. Instead of thinking...duh Sharon Stone could play Catwomen they cast her as an aging model obsessed with looking good. She has Halle Berry killed because she discovered that her aging make-up is dangerous. So Berry is brought back by cats and doesn't find it strange that she's more athletic and has a craving for cat food. She out plays Benjaman Bratt in Basketball and by jumping all over walls and being super athletic. Yet he doesn't figure out right away that she's catwomen. Oh plus she clawed his back when they had sex and...duh.<br /><br />  It's not a good movie, not by a long shot but still Batman & Robin makes it look like Spiderman 2.  Halle Berry thinks she's too good to have a small role in X-Men as Storm but hey at least those are good super hero movies. Plus after embarrassing herself in this she should settle for playing Storm with open arms. If they couldn't get Michelle Pfeiffer back they should've just said ok that's it...no movie. Either that or could've just had someone else play Selina Kyle. This movie is some fun here and there but the dialogue is awful. Plus isn't that much of a difference between Halle Berrie's performance here and Elizabeth Berkley's in Show Girls.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What happend to the ending?"></head><body><p>The first three-quarters of this movie are excellent! Robin Williams plays Sy, a pitifully lonely photo developer who just happens to be obsessed with a family who has their pictures processed by him. While we don't know much about his background, we do feel we know Sy, as we follow his miserable existence from his neat, but empty apartment to being hounded by his boss at work. The story becomes truly sinister as we see Sy wants to become part of this family, by any way he can. Up to this point, the movie is great!<p>But will someone please tell me who wrote the last 30 minutes of the film? Surely, some stranger walked in to the screenwriter's office, took the script away from him, and finished it, without reading it. The ending's style didn't match the preceeding part at all. I kept thinking, "Huh?" It completely fell apart and any tension that was built up was lost. Too bad, because it started out so well. Williams is excellent in his portrayal of a psycho, but the script let him and us down at the end.</p></body></html>

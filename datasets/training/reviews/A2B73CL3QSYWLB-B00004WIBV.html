<meta name="summary" content="Headless Horseman Undone By Brainless Script"></head><body><p>There is so much right about "Sleepy Hollow" that it's unfortunate it goes awry.  Terrific Hammer style cinematography.  Jaw dropping Oscar winning art direction.  Rousing Danny Elfman score.  Expectably fine work by Johnny Depp as the bumbling Ichabod Crane.  Terrifying turn by Christopher Walken as the Headless Hessian.  Too bad all of this is in the service of a byzantine script that practically undoes all that's good about the film.  The plot that engulfs this film is so maddeningly confusing you want to throw something at the screen.  I hate movies where the writers think they are smarter than the audience.  Director Tim Burton stages some interesting set pieces and at times there are some genuinely scary moments.  Not enough, however, to save this film from the mundane.</p></body></html>

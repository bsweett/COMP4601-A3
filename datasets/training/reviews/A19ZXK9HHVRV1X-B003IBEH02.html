<meta name="summary" content="fluid adaptation of a tricky premise"></head><body><p>"The Lovely Bones" is Peter Jackson's visionary adaptation of the bestselling novel by Alice Sebold.  Sebold's audacious conceit was to have her story told from the viewpoint of a 14-year-old girl (touchingly portrayed by Saoirse Ronan) who has just been kidnapped and murdered by the neighborhood pedophile (the movie takes place in early 1970s suburbia).  Susie's adventures in the afterlife are placed in direct apposition to a family's inconsolable grief, their attempts to come to terms with an unimaginable loss, and the efforts on the part of local law enforcement to bring her killer (creepily played by Stanley Tucci) to justice.  And what role, if any, can Susie herself play in effecting such an outcome from her place in the great beyond?<br /><br />There are those who will balk at the undeniably morbid nature of the material - and, indeed there are times when the why and the wherefore of it all seems as elusive to the storytellers as it is to the audience (the script was written by Fran Wa, Philippa Boyens and Jackson).  Still, this is a technically accomplished, visually stunning, and eerily mesmerizing melding of the worldly with the otherworldly, as Susie and her father (Mark Wahlberg) both learn the importance of letting go and moving on.<br /><br />In his direction, Jackson flows seamlessly between the dual "realities," refusing to set up clear lines of demarcation between the two.  The result is a fluid work that feels all of a piece - one that rarely jars us with gear-grinding tonal shifts or heavy-handed transitions.  Moreover, the mood is greatly enhanced and sustained by Brian Eno's haunting and ethereal score.<br /><br />All in all, a stylish and engrossing film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A film that lives up to the book, and so much more"></head><body><p>To Kill a Mockingbird, as other reviewers have noted, is probably not only one of the significant novels of our time, but also one of the most important movies. It is easy to see why this film resonates with the vast majority who see it, and why it consistently gets mentioned with being one of the 100 best films of all time. It is a rarity to have a film live up to a book, not only in its adaptation, but also how we visualize the story taking place. Producer (Alan J. Pakula) and director (Robert Mulligan) put together a perfect version of Harper Lee's novel, from the mood, music score, cinematography, and cast, who all personify the characters in the book. Gregory Peck was a perfect fit for Atticus Finch, as his taciturn manner, his stoic mood, and his unflinching attitude towards his principles is depicted with such precision. The young children cast as Scout and Jem also give fine performances.<br /><br />The film itself explores the theme of racial injustice and conflict in the South, but also the essence of believing and doing something because it is the right thing to do, and sticking with it until the end. In this case, Atticus Finch is the lawyer who takes on the case of Tom Robinson, a black man charged with rape, knowing full well that it isn't the popular decision in the Maycomb community, and that ultimately, he and his children will have to pay for it through insults, gossip and general Southern "inhospitality". Still, Atticus sticks to his guns, and doesn't let this get the best of him, a lesson that Jem and Scout learn as the film progresses. Gossiping neighbors whisper, not approving of what Atticus is doing. Atticus Finch has several conflicts with Bob Ewell, a trashy member of the community whose prejudice is evidenced when he spits on Atticus, calls him a derogatory term, and then seeks revenge later. As a result of Atticus' strong principles, Jem, his son, and Scout, his daughter, see the world through realistic viewpoints (albeit the ugliness of society's views on race becomes apparent). The children endure taunts from classmates and even relatives about their father defending Tom Robinson and, as the trail unfolds, the ugliness of class and racial injustice surfaces. Jem and Scout experience a coming of age; their innocent world view is contradicted by these unsettling events. The subplot of To Kill a Mockingbird concerns Boo Radley, a recluse who lives nearby, but has not been seen in years. Rumors swirl about Boo, usually involving something to do with his apparent "craziness", but there is no real proof, and Jem and Scout are left to their own imaginings. However, a significant event changes their perception of him and the world; they are able, as Atticus puts, see things from another person's perspective.<br /><br />This DVD is a wonderful tool also for any teacher who teaches the novel in high school, as the film is faithful to the book, including many essential scenes, so it is easy to read parts of the novel and then follow these with the film. Also included is a fantastic documentary which examines the making of the film, as well as interviews with several of the actors, such as Gregory Peck. All in all, this is one of the best films ever made, and a fantastic DVD to own.</p></body></html>

It takes place in corridors and sealed rooms, deep underground, with occasional forays into the shattered surface world of Berlin mere hours before the Russians overran it.<br /><br />The main character in the story is Tradl Junge, and was based in part on her memoirs, who as a young woman was hired as Hitler's secratary. Now after three years in his employ, she's seen him go through all sorts of moods, but hasn't until now seen him grimly suicidal.<br /><br />Hitler isn't the only one. Left and right his generals and commanders start killing themselves, at least those who don't try desprately to leave Berlin. Himmler even muses about making a peace with the Allies and wonders if, upon meeting Eisenhower, he should shake his hand or give the Nazi salute.<br /><br />The movie is also about the innocent. You see a young boy, not even old enough to shave, with his friends. All of them are wearing Hitler Youth uniforms. We learn in time that the boy is being given a medal for destroying two Russian tanks. His father is horrified. The boy, convinced he's immortal, is proud of himself, and ashamed of his father.<br /><br />The saddest of the innocent, though, are the Goebbels children. In the bunker they sing and play, and Frauline Junge does her best to look after them. Then their mother says she doesn't want them growing up in a world without National Socialism. Not long after, all the children are dead; killed by their mother, who is then shot by her husband, who then kills himself.<br /><br />The last days of the Nazi regeime leaves those more mythologically inclined to have flashbacks to Ragnarok, the Norse myth about the end of the world. Hitler, obsessed with appocalyptic imagry, seemed determined to bring about his own Ragnarok. You see him having conversations about how the German people failed him, and if they die, well, they'll get what they deserve. Towards the end he issus commands that even his loyal followers, like Albert Speer, are unable to follow.<br /><br />In the final scenes we see Tradl Junge and our young Hitler Youth member escape into the countryside on a bicycle. Yes, their lives as they know them are over, and there's sadness, but also a feeling of hope, and one remembers these are the people who in later years built Germany into the dynamo it's become.<br /><br />The movie is indeed sad, but also at the end uplifting and well worth seeing. Yes, it's in German with subtitles, but, well, deal. It's worth it. Trust me.</p></body></html>

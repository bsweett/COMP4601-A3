The digital animation is, of course first rate and the story has a nice message. I especially appreciated Newman's voice, his is the perfect voice for this character.  Look, I must confess, I cant stand Owen Wilson, his naisal voice and that bizarre nose, I mean what actress could have a career like he has had if she had a nose like that, I mean, right..but since I didnt not have to look at him, I actually liked his take on the main character, and Larry the Cable Guy is perfect as the old Redneck tow truck, as for the Porsche, I really didnt like Bonnie Hunt, her voice is too old, she is like well into her forties, they needed a Jennifer Anniston or Angie Jolie to voice that character, they are more Wilson's age, in all due respect, Hunt's voice was for like an 80's Accord, but whatever..cute movie, great vivid dig animation, kids will love it`</p></body></html>

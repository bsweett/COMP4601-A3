Intelligent, realistic, engaging, well-acted, well-directed and well-written (by Eric Roth and "Angels in America" playwright Tony Kushner), it has "Oscar" written all over it.<br /><br />The movie centers on the work of a secret Mossad assassination squad, tasked with killing the architects of the massacre of Israeli athletes at the '72 Olympic Games. The team is a varied lot - young and old, hot and cold-blooded, who share the common task of saving Israel by striking back at its enemies. Along the way, the team must negotiate with others' whose identities and loyalties are questionable at best. Can even the Mossad be trusted to give the team accurate information? Can information merchants Louis and his "Papa," who supply the team with leads, be trusted? Or are they playing the team against it other "clients" - playing both ends against the middle?<br /><br />"Munich" is realistically and appropriately gory, if that makes any sense. Explosives blow people to pieces. Guns of various caliber do their killing work in a variety of believable ways. Gunfights are messy, loud and confusing. And unlike some of Spielberg's other work, the special effects don't get in the way of the story. Thankfully!<br /><br />"Munich" also delves into the personal lives and motivations of the team. Defending one's country takes a psychic toll, which is presented here with pathos. Team leader Avram (sensitively played by Eric Bana), himself the son of a soul-wounded hero, wrestles not only with life and death decisions, but about their morality. When is it right to kill? Is vengeance a good enough motive? What if morally-defensible killing achieves no worthwhile end? And what if one's enemies have good reasons of their own for fighting? The scene in which Avram confronts a PLO commando underlines the moral complexity of fighting a war in which both sides have legitimate grievances and both want the same end: peace for their children. These questions are a sub-current to the action that gives it extra depth.<br /><br />Along with millions of others, I watched the 1972 Munich massacre unfold on ABC television, between footraces, javelin throws and pole vaulting. Archival footage is combined with movie footage, helping the viewer understand what transpired both before the cameras and out of sight. Some of the old familiar faces and voices- Jim Mackay and Peter Jennings-give the film historical resonance for those old enough to have watched it first hand. Probably because of a lack of film footage, the outcome and aftermath of the massacre have never received the attention that the hostage story did. While this film doesn't dwell on the death of the Israeli athletes in great detail, the story it does tell provides another compelling cinematic layer.<br /><br />"Munich" is an incredible film, and it deserves every award it will receive.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An excellent example of an air mobile assault"></head><body><p>We Were Soldiers is about a Lieutenant Colonel Harold Moore(played by Mel Gibson), commanding officer of one of the infantry battalions, the 1st of the 7th, of the 1st Calvary Division, during a fight in the Fall of 1965,since the book was written by Colonel Moore, now Lieutenant General (retired).  Colonel Moore comes off looking pretty good.  Maybe he was, maybe that's why he made Lieutenant General.<br /><br />All I can say is Hollywood sure loves napalm (it isn't anywhere near as effective as shown in the movie; the Air Force must have paid to have the movie made.  All I can say is that I never had a Phantom stay on station longer than ten minutes and you had to cease firing all artillery and mortars before they'd come in.  All for one or two 500 pound bombs.  Just not worth it.<br /><br />Artillery on the other hand could crank out 60 105mm rounds per minute sustained fire with a battery of six howitzers. . That's with just with the direct support 105mm howitzers in direct support of the infantry battalion, not counting any 155mm or eight inchers.<br /><br />This movie is primarily about the Battle of the Ia Drang Valley.  As far as I could tell it was fairly realistic, except that:<br /><br />I never saw the first tracer round fired and no one showed an illumination fire mission.  Useful when you're fighting at night.  They did show the infantry firing their 81mm mortars and their four deuces.  I used these primarily for illumination fire mission, of course I was in Viet Nam somewhat later, in 1969 and 1970, and had some twenty batteries of artillery that could shoot for me.<br /><br />As an artillery officer I'm appalled at how poorly they used their artillery fire support.  I would have relieved my forward observer if that had been mine.  Maybe artillery needs to hire a better PR firm.<br /><br />All-in-all an entertaining movie.<br /><br />The movie is rated R for a reason.  A lot of blood and guts.<br /><br />Gunner  June, 2007</p></body></html>

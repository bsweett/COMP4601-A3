<meta name="summary" content="the moon!"></head><body><p>Moon is definitely one of the more interesting films I've seen lately.  It's actually easy to understand from a storyline point of view, and that's not something I normally encounter with science fiction movies.  Normally while these type of movies roll along, I'm left sitting there totally confused and uncertain what's taking place on screen.  Not at all in this case.<br /><br />Let me state that I'm by no means an expert when it comes to outer space-type movies.  Most of the time I ignore them because they make little to no sense to me (because they require too much patience to absorb the finest of details).  Moon is an obvious exception.<br /><br />It's about a man who goes to the moon to gather enough resources (fusion energy) to bring back to earth.  However, he's apparently stuck on the moon for 3 years waiting for assistance to come, pick him up and take him back home to his loving wife and daughter.  A good portion of the storyline deals with his ability to accept being away from home for all those years.  It concerns the emotional side of him and tests his patience and level of frustration on numerous occasions.<br /><br />A good chunk of the storytelling deals with this robot/computer that's capable of interacting with the man extremely well.  It constantly guides the man to make the correct decisions by floating up and down the hallways of the lunar base.  This robot plays a BIG role in the storyline- it's constantly around.  The fact it's able to show emotion and especially sympathy is another fascinating element to the storyline.<br /><br />Eventually the storyline kicks in even more and the subject of cloning occurs.  Now THIS is when some obvious confusion will take place for the viewers.  Why?  Because the main character has a twin clone, and he shares the role of lead character.  The question then becomes "Which one is the man we've been seeing all along?"<br /><br />I will say this- the storyline isn't as confusing as it seems with one glaring exception- the final 10 minutes.  I'm not really sure what actually happened there.  It's not enough to encourage me to lower the rating, though.<br /><br />Overall, the acting is solid, the storytelling is compelling enough to keep your interest the entire time, and it's just an overall solid movie.</p></body></html>

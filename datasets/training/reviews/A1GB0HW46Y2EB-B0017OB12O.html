<meta name="summary" content="Classic Lean Film in Blu-ray"></head><body><p>What is there left to say about this great film?  It's worth noting that director David Lean's association with actor Alec Guinness goes back to his stupendous film of 1946 "Great Expectations" which Leonard Maltin refers to as "One of the greatest films ever made" with which I am in complete agreement.  There are precious few films directed by Lean in which Alec Guinness does not appear.  All that notwithstanding Lean and Guinness came to a major disagreement during the making of "Bridge" over Guinness's characterization and were not on speaking terms for a good part of the production period.  They had to have a messenger convey their communications.  I believe that when Guinness saw the finished cut of the film, he had to admit that David was right.<br /><br />The film has  an excellent cast:  William Holden, Sessue Hayakawa, James Donald and particularly Jack Hawkins, my favorite British actor.  His stunning performance in the great Ealing film "The Cruel Sea" (1953) about the war in the Atlantic during World War II is still among the best films of its kind.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version of "Bridge" is of particular benefit to this beautifully photographed film.  It has been pointed out that the explosions seen destroying the bridge do not correspond to the placement of the charges as seen the night before.  But that doesn't take away from the great power of this now classic film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An amalgamation of a bunch of movies."></head><body><p>The hype of this movie has been pretty low key. Arnold has gone out and done some interviews (actually, I think he's using this movie to sell his bid for the Governor job in California), but little else has been said.<br /><br />It is ten years later and the expected holocaust that Sarah Conner had nightmares of never happened. However, John cannot seem to let it go and is leading a hobo life in anticipation that Skynet will one day become aware. It becomes reality as a new terminator is sent back to destroy John Connor and his future lieutenant in order to rewrite history while the rebellion sends back their own terminator to protect him. This time, not only is John's life on the line, but also the lives of the world as the new Terminatrix prepares for the arrival of her master, the Skynet AI. It will be up to John and the old T101 (and his future wife Kate Brewster) to prevent that from happening.<br /><br />This movie is a hack in many regards and the source it steals from most is T2: Judgment Day. From the fact that there are two Terminators in a showdown to the fact that Arnold has to have the Ray-ban glasses, much of this movie can be seen in the previous movie. However, this time, Arnold is less the nurturing machine to the man-child John and more the sarcastic killing sidekick. Only Arnold has the one liners in this movie and he does say them with the relish he can get away with under his emotionless exterior. Another movie this borrows from is from the Matrix (even though the series came out 13 years earlier) but more in fact, the Animatrix. Of course, you can also say that the movie also stole from the Forbin project back in the 1970's. It sees a time, where there is no AI mainframe, where the computers will attack from the world wide web, which is different from the movies which also tried to characterize a supercomputer (HAL 9000) adversary as a physical box which could be overcome. The way that T3 falls is more like tha Anime movies like Ghost in the Shell where AI consciousness is gained in a global web.<br /><br />Going back to Animatrix, T3 follows the stories in that short stories DVD that reflect the human history and their war with the AI. It is similar (As with the Forbin Project) that human's are deemed as a threat to their existence and need to be wiped out. This movie portrays this fairly well.<br /><br />Another movie series this rips from is the "Planet of the Apes" series. Like those four movies which do a full circle and come around, the Terminator movies also do the same, and that's why I really liked the depressing ending. Some people think that the ending opens up for a fourth Terminator movie where it would end with Reese (Michael Biehn) going back in time to save the original Sarah. I guess the take of T3 will decide that.<br /><br />The acting is done well in most regards. Claire Danes, who plays the spunky Kate is almost unrecognizable (she always plays this weepy girly girl character) and is pretty good with the material she's given. Arnold seems to have this role down pat and is on cruise control. It is remarkable that in 20 years, his body has not changed much. Nick Stahl does a great job playing John Connor, but he does not look like the hero, resemble or carry himself like the John Connor first Terminator movie. For some reason that did bother me. However, even though he will always be ADD boy from "Man without a Face" he gets the aimless man with a mission thing down good and comes off much better than the whiny kid that was portrayed by Edward Furlong in T2. Kristanna Loken does a fantastic job as the TX, much better than the T1000 played by Robert Patrick in the second movie. All she is required to do is run, fight and look unemotional and she pulls it off well. Of course, this doesn't mean that she can act, but for this role, she knew what it requred.<br /><br />The main fault of this movie is not that is more of a classic big-budget movie, but it is an old style movie that has no flair or panache. Maybe I'm still being wowed by effect heavy or "slow mo in every frame" fare like charlie's Angels or the Matrix where every action frame has to stand out on their own, or epics like the "Lord of the Rings" where the computer devises thousands of enemies to fight the heroes, but this movie seems to be a little small. Take the scene where John is being followed by the TX and 4 cars she is controlling. 5 years ago, that would have been an amazing scene with ET and Extra doing round the clock interview on how they could destroy a building with an industrial crane, nowadays, it's like: "What, they didn't use a computer?" However, Mostow films it a little to matter of factly, no overhead shots, no wide angle shots. It's actually fairly choppy, like the whole chase scene (which actually looked better planned out than the Matrix car chase). Everything in this movie has a low budget feel to it and it is because this movie is relic of action movies past.<br /><br />However, saying that, as an older movie watcher, I did like the action scenes and I felt the movie did go at a quick enough pace. I feel that the movie didn't really with the issue of "Should John risk it and go and fight to save the present? Or Hide and know he will save the future?" That could have been an interesting premise. Anyway, compared to the Matrix Reloaded and Charlies Angels, this one is the best of the bunch and will provide a good time that exists slightly above the those who like their movies brain DOA....Rating: B-<br /><br />PS: In all these movies, how come the good guy doesn't come like several days ahead and take care of the situation?</p></body></html>

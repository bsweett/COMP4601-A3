<meta name="summary" content="Nowhere as bad as some critics say"></head><body><p>Had the good fortune to see this while in Asia. Ha ha!<br /><br />I was worried because the first review I read panned it for many issues, foremost of which was having too many disparate plot threads and a low-stakes tussle (over who wins an arms deal). I'm happy to say this is not the case at all.<br /><br />IM2 picks up where 1 left off. Tony Stark is a one-man peacekeeping (and peacemaking) machine, but he's gradually being poisoned by the palladium in his power source. This is turning him to drink and general recklessness, which puts his friends and others at risk, in a few exciting set pieces throughout, one of which is an amazing attack during an F1 race.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mickey Rourke plays Vanko, the son of his father's ex-partner who is hatching plans for what he considers revenge, having access to similar technical knowledge. I will not divulge further details, so you can guess at what is true and what is not.<br /><br />Sam Rockwell is a rival arms manufacturer, Hammer, who tries to use Vanko to further his arms race against Stark. As usual, the exchanges between him and Vanko are the most boring and predictable of the movie, because we all know what bad guys are going to say, well ahead of time, because, well, they're bad. (As one writer has put it, it is the saints (in this case, Tony and friends) who are the real characters; they're more believable and unpredictable because of their internal struggles.) But they do their best with the material they're given. He does his dancing cameo here, never fear.<br /><br />So, as the negative review I first read says, the stakes seem to be really low - it's about who wins the arms deal. But it really isn't, and I think you'll see that. The deal is only the surface of a greater threat.<br /><br />Another thread is Tony's interest in Johannson's character versus Paltrow's. But this is also part of the overall scheme of things, not a throwaway. I didn't see at first how Tony could get sidetracked from Pepper, but I guess it's part of his deterioration, and of course makes for some romantic tension. As seen in the previews, Johannson will get into some matrix-like action, interspersed with some other (fighting) action involving Tony's driver to humorous effect.<br /><br />Yet another thread is resolving Tony's relationship with his father. Was his father, whom he felt always held him at arm's length, a cheat, or something worse? Did his father hold the key to Tony's salvation? A little far-fetched, but this is a comic, right?<br /><br />Don Cheadle is the foil to Tony's self-destructive downslide, and their friendship is strained by competing interests besides, one of whom is Gary Shandling's oily, bloated politician who is insisting that Stark turns over the suit to the US - actually an interesting point, since the question is, do we want to put all our eggs in Tony's basket? Shandling is cast as the "bad" guy of sorts, but it's a grey area and he gets a surprising dig in the end.<br /><br />The effects are well done. There is mundo action and destruction, also touched with humor in the midst of terrifying threats. I felt some aspects of the pre-final battle were a little too easy, but it makes sense in terms of the major players (Hammer vs. Stark) and their companies as "characters", which is built up throughout the movie.<br /><br />We have hints of the Avenger initiative, but not much - stay for the after-credits teaser, thin though it is.<br /><br />Everything comes together and every part makes for a great time at the movies.</p></body></html>

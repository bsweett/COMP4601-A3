<meta name="summary" content="Terror in coach! (or is that redundant?)"></head><body><p>Horror master Wes Craven does himself proud with this one. Red Eye is a lean suspense thriller, which benefits with a taut, snappy script, fine acting by Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy, and, of course, competent, no-nonsense directing by you-know-you.<br /><br />The film's plot centers around hotel manager Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) taking a delayed redeye flight to Miami after attending her grandmother's funeral. At the airport, she meets a helpful charmer by the name of Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) and some kind of spark is lit. But, because this is a Craven film, all the flirty shenanigans soon give way to horrific cat-and-mouse tension as Lisa quickly becomes embroiled in a plot to assassinate a high level Homeland Security muckamuck (and his family) who happens to be staying at her hotel.<br /><br />This was an enjoyable little flick. At a quick-moving 85 minutes, Red Eye contains no excess fat. We are propelled from scene to purposeful scene as Lisa and Jackson meet kinda cute and have an airport flirtation, which culminates in the reveal that Jackson Rippner is an assassin, with Lisa's dad as one of his targets. Even though the first two thirds of the film is pretty much a two-person character study, comprising of an ongoing playful-then-tense chatfest between Lisa and Jackson, it never gets dull for the audience.<br /><br />Craven really knows how to ratchet up the pressure, as we feel Lisa's despair and helplessness in the face of Jackson's smiling, direct-talking menace. And, because these scenes take place inside the coach cabin, in front of other unknowing passengers, Lisa's attempts to maintain composure is all the more nerve-wracking and the more frustratingly felt by the audience. When Lisa locks herself in the restroom and finally has a chance to let go and cry it out, it serves to be a  cathartic scene. The film's stressful atmosphere was most heightened and best maintained during the airplane scenes, due in large part to the compressed surroundings. There actually was an easing of tension when Lisa disembarks and goes into full-blown action heroine mode. Another factor in the film's favor was that Craven paid attention to detail with regards to the other plane passengers, giving them throw away context. It just made the premise seem more real.<br /><br />Naturally, Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy deserve great credit for their nuanced performances. Murphy, with his icy blue eyes conveying menace, translates well into a villain (but we already knew that from his role of the Scarecrow in Bats Begins). His character has enough calculated charisma that his "chance" meeting with Lisa and her resulting attraction for him are entirely plausible. If people weren't yet convinced that Rachel McAdams can act, well, this is another character she fully sinks into. So far, I haven't seen her repeat a role. And, even more than Murphy, she carries this movie. Her Lisa Reisert is resilient and resourceful and immensely likable. Also worth mentioning is wide-eyed Jayma Mays as the beleaguered hotel clerk Cynthia, who, before the end credits roll, informs Lisa, "I think we had a really good night, all things considered - just that one incident, really." Brian Cox, however, is wasted here in a, for all intents and purposes, "damsel in distress" role.<br /><br />As for the special features, Red Eye has your typical ones: film commentary by the filmmakers (including director Wes Craven), a gag reel (the little girl is the funniest), a making-of featurette, and a segment focusing on Craven and his directing of Red Eye, "Wes Craven: A New Kind of Thriller."<br /><br />Red Eye is a study in brisk, exciting, professional filmmaking. I doubt it won any awards but I betcha it gains a cult following. My male-driven, fact-based logic tells me so.</p></body></html>

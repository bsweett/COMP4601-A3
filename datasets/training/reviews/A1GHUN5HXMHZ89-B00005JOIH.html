<meta name="summary" content="Munich Revealed"></head><body><p>In 1972 I was twenty-one when I heard on the news that the Olympic Israeli quarters had been assaulted by terrorist. The world held it's breath and waited. When all the hostages were killed there was little sympathy then for the PLO plight. After all what country wanted terrorist to come to a neutral place that was about peaceful competition and kill their athletes? However; revenge is a double-edged sword as well. The price paid to have it is often to steep. Those Israelis that set out to have revenge on the terrorist paid a high price. I am sure Spielberg did everything possible to tell most of the story about how the Munich terrorist where tracked and assasinated. You can argue politics and religion all you like about who is treated unfairly, the movie is done superbly. Spielberg is a fine director that knows what needs to be told and how to keep the story from being to complex and muddled. He doesn't go into all the minutiae as some directors have done of late. Although the movie is long I was never bored or tired. It kept my interest throughout and I found the revelations of what occurred during and after the 1972 Olympic Games attack fascinating. If you enjoyed his dramas like "Schindler's List" and "Empire of the Sun" you will probably enjoy this as well. Even people who have never seen his movies should like this account of how Israel dealt with the attack on their people at the Olympic Games. An excellent job of showing the length, the cost, and the personal sacrifices made to accomplish their goals.</p></body></html>

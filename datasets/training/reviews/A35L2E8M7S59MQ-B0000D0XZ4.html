From the advertising campaign it appeared to be a mindless special effects extravaganza with little to no plot whatsoever; AKA Summer Fun.  For those who went to see it with that mindset it was undoubtedly a not so pleasant surprise.  Most of whom who saw this on its initial theatrical release obviously had not foreseen Ang Lee's philosophical drama, and they instantly retaliated causing Hulk to fail in most ways.<br /><br />I was surprised, but not in the way these common viewers were, because I loved Hulk.  It is a superhero movie unlike any other comic based film in the last twenty-five years.  This is a film that is filled with heart and emotion and delivers it fully in ways no other film of this genre has done before it.  The art direction and special effects are astounding, and helps bring this comic character to life and oh so much more.<br /><br />The plot starts off rather simply with David Banner, a geneticist who has been studying regeneration, experimenting on various animals and finally ends up injecting himself.  Eventually the mustached scientist has a son - Bruce Banner - who has apparently inherited his father's lab created gene.<br /><br />We now skip forward several years as Bruce begins studying exactly what his father had all those years before: regeneration.  This only ends in what can only be described as disaster as an exposure of "Gamma Rays" causes his inherited gene to emerge transforming him into the not so jolly, green behemoth known as the Hulk.  From there we are thrown into several well done action sequences as the military under the command of Gen. Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross (a very human and well-crafted performance by Sam Elliot) begins an attempt to capture Bruce/Hulk to obtain this gene.  Only complicating Bruce's hectic life is the reappearance of his crazed father who also cares more about the studies of his past opposed to his son's well-being which goes beyond abuse before finally leading up to an enormous CGI confrontation between mutated father and son.<br /><br />The Hulk does lack in the category of CGI at times with quality going up and down during a few cuts, and an adrenaline junkie will not enjoy the level of dialogue and drama that fills this plot that must have been a cinematic fusion between King Kong, Frankenstein and Marvel Comics.  Ang Lee perfectly utilizes the split frame, thus turning this film into a living comic book and the entire cast does their part in moving the plot along.  This isn't so much a superhero film as it is a doorway looking into the delicacy of humanity.  You know and care about the characters, and you can certainly care about the man beneath the giant green muscled frame of the Hulk.  That is what the movie is about, not a giant green man smashing things up for ninety minutes like so many 2003 movie goers were expecting.<br /><br />Sadly this film didn't hit the audience it should've due to Universal's careless advertising that passed this off as a popcorn film.  If you're someone who likes emotionally compelling and ambitious tales Hulk (2003) may be the superhero film for you.  If you liked Frankenstein or any of the King Kong adaptations Hulk will probably be a movie for you, just don't go in unprepared to think about the material you're viewing.  This is one that one should defiantly pay attention to because it is probably the most underrated film of the 20th century.</p></body></html>

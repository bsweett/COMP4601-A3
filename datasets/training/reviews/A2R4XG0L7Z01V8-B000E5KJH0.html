It was apparently supposed to be set in 1997 (when it was filmed in 2004/2005, why I have no idea), and there's a really obvious mention about James Cameron's Titanic, which wouldn't have been out yet. It had already been mentioned that it was January 1997, which would mean the film wasn't even OUT yet. Hats also disappear clean off character's head from one shot to the next, hair goes from behind the ear to loose (that really bugs me!)<br /><br />Why exactly is Kathy Bates uncredited as well? Sure, she's hardly in the film but still! There's a lot of references to other films, the main one being The Graduate, which I haven't actually seen. Many reviewers have said that Rumor Has It is like a sequel to The Graduate. No it's not. It's just referencing it, and updating the story a little for a new generation.<br /><br />The film's basically about a girl finding out her grandmother actually inspired the film (why not the book? It was a book first! The book was mentioned once, and then she even watches a video of The Graduate) The Graduate. She discovers her grandmother & mother had a fling with this one man, who she promptly thinks is her father, but then discovers he's sterile, so has a fling with him too. (How many guys would have used the "I'm sterile" line just to get a girl into bed?)<br /><br />The thing that gets me is that you can see from the start of the film is that the relationship that Sarah (Jennifer Aniston) is in isn't gonna last. They're engaged - but she doesn't wear the ring. They try to join the Mile High Club, but fail miserably.<br /><br />The film's perfectly entertaining, it's not a bad movie and alright for a day off work, when the weather's windy and rainy outside. It's instantly forgettable, Jennifer plays her usual role, as does Mark Ruffalo (can we try showing some emotion, or a different facial expression please? Move aside Heath Ledger, I've found a new candidate!) I would give it a shot, but it's basically forgettable, and I wouldn't pay OTT prices for it.</p></body></html>

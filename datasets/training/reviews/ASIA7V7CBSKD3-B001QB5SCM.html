<meta name="summary" content="Definate Chick Flick"></head><body><p>Being a guy I can't say I really wanted to see this movie.  But after my fiancee bought it I ended up watching it with her one afternoon and it wasn't half bad.  For being a Chick Flick there is a fair amount of guy humor and enough diversity that anyone can get drawn into the movie.  Overall I'd say it is a typical Cameron Diaz movie.</p></body></html>

To say Tombstone is unbelievably good is to trammel it down in the muck.  What you've got to do is grab each person you know by the lapels and shake them back and forth while screaming in their face that they absolutely must see this film.  Friends don't let friends not see Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holliday - easily the most inspired character in all of fiction.  I will stack Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday up against any other character that has ever been created by an artist.  He will win.  Hamlet?  Come off it love.  Who do you think you're fooling with this Shakespeare routine?  Certainly not me and probably not even yourself, as you yawn and scratch your way through yet another &quot;masterpiece.&quot;  Why don't you make a clean slate of it and just admit to yourself finally that Shakespeare bores the crud out of you and his plays are irritating beyond belief?  But Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday... now THERE'S literature!  Stack him up against Hamlet and he'll blow his brains out with his ivory handled revolvers.  And as Hamlet gags and sputters and reels and staggers Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday will yell, &quot;C'mown, Johnny, C'MOWN!&quot;  And he will advance solicitously, full of adroit concern as Hamlet collapses, saying, &quot;Oh you're no daisy.  You're no daisy atall!&quot;</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="cynical, deadly, evil, and pathetic"></head><body><p>This is a pretty good film about a man who self-actualizes the corruption that is in the deepest part of his soul as a black market arms dealer.  Cage narrates this life - out only for himself, regardless of who he helps to kill - and it is effective to a degree.  We witness his rise, his many ruses to avoid prison or execution, and its repercussions on his personal life.  I admit, Cage's dark humor and splendidly indifferent tone are at times funny and affecting.  But the best characterizations, I think, are in the people he encounters, from the cold rival arms dealer he fights to the brutal African thug who makes him rich.  It is very good acting.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this is Hollywood trying to display some social conscience.  There is a kind of breathlessness to it, like they are revealing something to the audience, almost as reporting, but I found its sincerity rather naive.  While it is good to expose audiences to this, I suppose, the tone of the film implies that none of us know about these kinds of people already.  (I, for one, have been following the issue since 1982, when I read The Global Politics of Arms Sales,  by Andrew Pierre, which is a great academic masterwork, or Anthony Sampson's reporting on it from the early 1980s.)<br /><br />There is no way you can say airing these issues is bad.  Recommended for those who haven't follwed the issue of international arms trafficing.</p></body></html>

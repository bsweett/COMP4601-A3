Sounds like a very boring premise, right? Wrong! Director Peter Weir has done an outstanding job in creating an exciting atmosphere and hooking the viewer throughout the duration of the film. <p>It is April 1805 and Napoleon has only one last barrier to cross in order to rule over Europe: the British Fleet. Lucky Jack (Russell Crowe) is the captain of the Surprise, an English ship sailing in the north coast of Brazil, when the Acheron, a French ship that outclasses them in speed and weaponry, attacks them. The Surprise, which was surprised by the Acheron, was saved by miracle of the fog, were they lost themselves preventing their doom. Now Lucky Jack has to decide whether to return home for repairs and reinforcements, or go after the aggressor and try to defeat this dangerous enemy. Obviously, Jack chooses the latter path, even against the advice of some of his nearest officers in rank. <p>One of the aspects that make this movie extremely interesting is that it reveals the way of living aboard a battle ship in the beginning of the nineteenth century. For example, the audience gets to see the relationship forged between these men and the rules of honor that determine their conduct. Among these rules, we can observe that the value of friendship is paramount. <p>This production of epic magnitude delivers what it promises: action, glorious settings, impeccable performances and a nail biting chase between to ships that become archrivals. In some aspects, the relationship between Lucky Jack and the Acheron reminds me of the one between Captain Ahab and Moby Dick. Finally, if you ever watched the America's Cup and rejoiced in the strategy that it entails, you will find yourself pleased with the amount of strategy involved in this battle too.</p></body></html>

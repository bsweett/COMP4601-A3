Despite that, it is simply brilliant, and not boring at all.<br /><br />Why? Well, there are different reasons to say that, but I think I'll point out only those that I deem more important:<br /><br />1- To start with, even though this film was made in 1964, director Stanley Kubrick managed to create a timeless masterpiece that depicts, in a sardonic way, the dangers of nuclear war. The message of this movie still comes across as valid, albeit nowadays for different reasons.<br /><br />2- Secondly, even though the subject is undeniably serious, this movie is a black comedy that makes you laugh. If that is difficult to believe, take into account that the plot involves a crazy general (Sterling Hayden) that sidesteps the chain of command in order to launch a nuclear airstrike on the URSS, something his aide (Captain Mandrake, played by Peter Sellers), the President (played by Peter Sellers!!) and many of his advisors (including Dr. Strangelove, a scientist also played by Peter Sellers) try to stop. But will that be possible? And what about the Soviet "Doomsday Machine", that will be triggered automatically by any nuclear attack on Soviet soil?<br /><br />All in all, I think this is the kind of movie you simply must watch. Highly recommended  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="For Frank Miller die-hard fans only"></head><body><p>...the rest of us skip this movie.  I'll admit the best thing about the movie is the way it looks.  Rodriguez did an excellenct job in bring a comic book to life.  However, some things need to stick to their original medium.  I'm counting these illogical wrecks of mini-stories as those that fit in this catagory.  After Micky Rourke's short (the best one, IMHO) I was ready for this movie to end.  Clive Owens seemed miscasted, but Benico sort of saved the day on that story, but it was still riding on the so-so part.  After that, I'm thinking surely that's the end...BUT NO.  It keeps going and going, until I'm practically begging the DVD player, please no more.  Then there's just one more bit, that I was so close to pulling my hair out, that I was relieved that it only lasted less than a minute.  Oh, Thank God.  If over the top violence is what gets you off, then this is the movie for you.  If not, please, please avoid this movie.</p></body></html>

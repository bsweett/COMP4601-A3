<meta name="summary" content="FBI gets lucky"></head><body><p>A good but slightly unbelievable film about a small group of FBI lead by Jamie Fox who investigate a terrorist bombing in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia which involved the loss of large number of american lives. They get a permission by the saudi empire for 3 days worth of investigations. The team intends to do a forensic investigation to try to hopefully<br />identify the perpetrators for the bombing. They are arrive at the bomb site and piece together that an ambulance had the explosive (Great how does that help find the culprit ?). They find some marbles at the bombsite (fantastic !). And they find a location from which the terrorists filmed the live event (which was sent to the press)(Good work guys !). So they do all this and are about to head back home as their time is up but lucky for them the bad guys decide to kill these guys but in the process, the Jamie Fox team tails out the terrorists, finds their hideout and saves one of their friends just in the nick of time escaping certain beheading . The action is great, the chase scenes are great, the free way crashes are well choreographed, but we've seen this done better in the Bourne Series. The Bourne movies have now kind of numbed me to car chases and explosions. It's all been done. But at the end, the story of Kingdom seems like a child's dream. Things just seem to be happening at the right time and in the right way for the FBI team to kill the terrorist bad guys. The Movie starts out in a lovely opening style with the whole middleast political background explained via collages of drawings interspersed with real footage. I loved that though.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></body></html>

What gives?"></head><body><p>Roland Emmerich reminds me of Michael Bay: they don't make action films that have character and heart like Spielberg or Cameron, they just make popcorn films. Emmerich did a great job when he did Stargate and Universal Soldier but then made this and I have seen it 11 times already but each time I hate parts of it yet I always go back, go figure.<br /><br />A massive ship(550 KM) appears in Earth's atmosphere and the US is scrambling to figure out what's going on. The ship then splits into about 15 smaller crafts but smaller's the wrong word since each one is 15 miles long anyway. Cities slowly start to evacuate until one scientist figures out(was that signal in morse code? Pretty smart aliens) that they're gonna fire on Earth. And boy do they. The cities literally get engulfed in building-high flames and destroys the city.<br /><br />The president has to land at Area 51 and finds out that the aliens(in probably the dumbest plot contrivance ever) are going to destroy every city on Earth and move on. The aforementioned scientist figures out a way to beat them and to destroy the ships, they just have to go to Big Mama's ship first.<br /><br />In terms of character development and a simple plot, there isn't one. Simple meaning that everything makes sense without you going "but how did?". Like when that scientist is able to hook up to the mothership with his laptop. My floppy disc can't even read Mac programs but his can link up with alien computers? BAH. What you do get though instead is big flashing and boomy stuff. Explosions, explosions and effects galore. It's certainly cool to watch but it just hurts your brain.<br /><br />The acting pretty much sucks, bad dialogue, convenient plot turns but it sure does look neat.</p></body></html>

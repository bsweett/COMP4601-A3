<meta name="summary" content="NOT BAD BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS STAY AWAY FROM THESE REVIEWS!!"></head><body><p>I RENTED HIDE AND SEEK, AND NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE. I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE AND WENT ON AMAZON TO SEE WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT OF THIS MOVIE. AND I DIDNT READ EACH REVIEW, JUST BROWSING THE TITLES TO SEE IF PEOPLE LIKED IT OR HATED IT AND SOME MORON ACTUALLY WROTE THE ENDING TO THIS MOVIE IN HIS TITLE!! AND I COULDNT GET IT OUTTA MY MIND. WHAT A SPOILER TO ALREADY KNOW THE ENDING BEFORE WATCHING IT. IT'S A SUSPENSE THRILLER AND DENIRO IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS, BUT TO THE IDIOT WHO WROTE WHAT HAPPENS AT THE END IN HIS REVIEW THANKS ALOT. I WOULD HAVE ENJOYED THIS MOVIE MORE IF I DIDNT KNOW ROBERT IS CHARLIE. SHEESH. YOU CAN WRITE WHATEVER YOU WANT IN YOUR REVIEW BUT DONT SPOIL IT FOR OTHERS AND WRITE THE F*CKING ENDING IN YOUR TITLE BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE HAVENT SEEN IT YET. BUT ANYWAY, THE MOVIE WASNT BAD AT ALL. NOT A HORROR, BUT DEFINATELY DISTURBING ENOUGH TO BE CREEPY. I LIKE SUSPENSES, AND I'M SICK OF PEOPLE COMPARING MOVIES TO OTHER MOVIES. THIS MOVIE HIDE AND SEEK HAS BEEN COMPARED TO SECRET WINDOW WITH JHONNY DEPP AND THAT'S A GIVE AWAY ALSO TO COMPARE IT TO THAT MOVIE FOR THOSE WHO HAVENT SEEN HIDE AND SEEK BUT SAW SECRET WINDOW. BUT BOTH STORIES ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. DENIRO DID A FINE ACTING JOB IN HIDE AND SEEK, AND DAKOTA FANNING IS PHENOMINAL. WHAT A CHILLING PERFORMANCE SHE GAVE. THAT'S A HECK OF ALOT OF TALENT FOR ONE LITTLE GIRL. I THOUGHT THE MOVIE HAD SOMEWHAT OF AN ORIGINAL IDEA. IT DID LAG A LITTLE AT THE END, AND I DIDNT UNDERSTAND THE TWO HEADED FACE PICTURE. DENIRO HAD THE SPLIT PERSONALIOTY, NOT EMILY. BUT THERE ARE OTHER ALTERNATE ENDINGS, AT LEAST I DONT KNOW AHEAD OF TIME WHAT THOSE ARE. SHEESH.</p></body></html>

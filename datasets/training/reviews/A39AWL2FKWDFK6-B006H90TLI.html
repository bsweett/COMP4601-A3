<meta name="summary" content="A Coen brothers gem"></head><body><p>Using panoramic Texas and New Mexico scenery as a backdrop Ethan and Joel Coen fabricated a gripping, outstanding adaptation of Cormac MacCarthy's "No Country for Old Men".  Commencing with a monologue about the changing times from weary Texas sheriff Ed Tom Bell played by a craggy and ancient looking Tommy Lee Jones, the film quickly propels into the main storyline.<br /><br />Retired welder and ex-Vietnam vet Llewelyn Moss played by Josh Brolin is out in the desert near the Mexican border, hunting proghorn.  Tracking a wounded animal he comes across a charnel among a convoy of vehicles, a drug deal gone bad with dead bodies and a huge cache of drugs.  He also finds a satchel packed with about 2 million in cash which he is determined to keep.  Almost immediately he is pursued by a monstrous psychopathic killer hired to recover the loot named Anton Chigurh played terrifyingly by Javier Bardem.<br /><br />We first meet a handcuffed Chigurh as he is strangling the deputy who had the misfortune of arresting him, at the police station.  He recovers his possesions, namely a captive bolt pistol or cattlegun, which he uses to kill anyone that gets in his way as he goes rampaging through the countryside.<br /><br />Meanwhile sheriff Bell gets wind of what happened and is trying to get to Moss to protect him by recruiting his wife Carla Jean played by Kelly MacDonald.  Chigurh, however using a transponder hidden in the money is pursuing Brolin through Texas and into Mexico.  The rightful owners of the money also hire bounty hunter and former partner of Chigurh, Carson Wells played comedically by Woody Harrelson.<br /><br />What we have is essentially is a film where everyone is chasing someone or something leaving behind a trail of violence in the wake.<br /><br />The character developement courtesy of the talented Coen's is first rate creating a dichotomy on either side of the spectrum of drugs and violence.  The tired, ready to retire Bell played so effortlessly by Jones can't survive anymore in a word populated by soulless killing machines like Bardem.<br /><br />The truncated ending which may be disturbing at some level leaves open a plethora of possibilities for the analysis of this thought provoking flick.</p></body></html>

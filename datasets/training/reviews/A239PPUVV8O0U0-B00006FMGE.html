<meta name="summary" content="Director Is Still Trying To Adapt the Book"></head><body><p>Like the first, the sequel suffers from being too long and literally trying to adapt the book. It worked for Lord of the Rings and they STILL cut out a lot from the books (though they did embelish a little in Two Towers by bringing in the Elves at Helm's Deep but I digress). The young cast has aged a little, clearly for the young men (they're voices are starting to get deeper). Though, to me anyways as I haven't read the books in a while, it gets a little tiring of Ron Weasley being reduced to the comedic sidekick. I know he is one, but not all need to be used for comedic relief. The elder cast is still perfect for their respective roles and Kenneth Branagh is excellent as the ego-centric Lockhart. Again, they could've trimmed up a few things; Harry didn't need to look at every little thing in the Weasley's home (despite the fact that he's not used to magic homes), Ron's slug scene could've been eliminated, some characters that're important in the novel (like Justin and Colin [who at least is important in later books]) are glanced over and are only petrified as that's what happens to them in the book. Still no Peeves (the one character I'm glad they decide to cut out as he adds nothing to the story) and instead of they're ghostly Magical History teacher giving the speech on the Chamber, its McGonagall, which I think is a better switch as they're history teacher is hardly ever mentioned once or twice in the books anyway. Action scenes and CGI are better in this than the last, Dobby and the Basilisk being the highlights of the computer charcters. And hardly any new music from John Williams, who's music from the first film is pretty much tracked to this.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="When Will These Childish Individuals Ever Grow Up?"></head><body><p>This is a movie that could not have been made fifty years ago.  Audiences during that era would not take seriously a story about two immature people nearing forty who still don't have their act together.  Jennifer Aniston portrays a woman who may even be too old to have children.  The Vince Vaughn character plays video games. Needless to add, everything is always about their selfish pleasures.  One cannot imagine either individual engaging in a serious discussion about politics or other major issues.  Describing them as merely superficial is perhaps being too kind.  This movie inadvertently highlights why Western Civilization may be doomed.  There are simply far too many couples that behave in this manner.  "The Break-Up" might compel you to ask a provocative question:  Are things really this bad?  Take a chance.  It's worth two hours of your time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Absorbing existential drama !"></head><body><p>This film is no more no less a tragedy of wills opressed for a set of pre established rules they just can not overpass .<br /><br />Kathy Nicolo (Jennifer Connely)is a lonely woman who has not been readapt her new life and face it . Her depression carries her to ignore the world and in that isolation abandons herself in all the aspects . that position will contain precisely the dramatic nervous of the film .<br /><br />Massoud Amir Behrani is an Iranian Colonel who fled Iran when the ancient Shah governement collapses . In this inmigrant state he really wants to rebuild a new life trying to reproduce with the major fidelity his iranian house . The Caspian will be replaced for the Pacific Ocean . He is linked for his ancient memories his dignity and pride is held even he works in a simple asphalt company . We can watch him dressing elegantly after his job . And the unforgetable wedding of his daughter seems to prove it .<br /><br />Finally we have to a sympathetic cop really unhappy with a marriage in aparience .<br /><br />The three axis are described and every one with its inner energy will be trying to conquer new goals , except Conelly who really wants to get what she really left , her home made with sacrifice for her own father .<br /><br />The love , the pride and the lost status , everyone of them will have its own energy and the unavoidable intersection will spark the tragedy .<br /><br />Vadim Pederlman debut directorial is simply splendid. His style is very personal and you can notice the influence of Kurosawa (the camera toward the sun in clear hommage to Rashomon) and Tarkovsky (the ode to the nature) in his narrative flow , highlighted by superb backgrounds and outstanding landscapes who work out themselves as smart link sequences .<br /><br />Kingsley acting is overwhelming and after watching the movie I would really have wished Kingsley and Penn would have shared the expected Academy Award .<br /><br />It was a question of fairness .<br /><br />One of the top films in 2003 .</p></body></html>

There's no better way to understand how capitalism and the American Dream really works. I'd never seen Scarface and the reviews here made me feel I must be missing a classic. Nope. This really is unredeemably awful - and I could watch Al Pacino do cat food adverts he's that good. Brian de Palma, with a couple of exceptions, (Carlito's Way, The Untouchables), makes bloody awful films. This has a great cast, a mediocre script, truly bad direction and a soundtrack so awful that if you tried to pass it off as a pastiche of bad eighties music, it just wouldn't be plausible. I think my personal lowlights from this film come early on - the riot scene in the detention centre has no sense of menace or chaos, but consists entirely of dodgy looking extras standing on the spot, hopping from one foot to the other, waving sticks or bricks and grimacing unconvincingly. It's pathetic. And Tony Montana's first job in Miami is wonderful - he has to negotiate a deal with a Colombian coke dealer who's briefcase has two compartments - one for the coke, one for the chainsaw he uses to torture people. Isn't that fantastic? The shops must be full of stuff like that in Colombia, probably the only kind of equipment any self respecting dealer would travel with.... As for the final bloodbath - it is incredibly silly, but to get there you have to sit through two hours of a shapeless, boring tripe. If you've never seen this film, really, don't worry.</p></body></html>

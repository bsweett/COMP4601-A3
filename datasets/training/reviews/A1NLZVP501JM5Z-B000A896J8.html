It is about two cultures fighting for what they belive is right.  It is a fantastic movie.  The thing I don't like is that Ridley Scott seems to wimp out by portraying the Christians as bloodthristy and having the Muslims seem like heroes.  Its almost as if hes afraid of upsetting people. Overall its a great film.</p></body></html>

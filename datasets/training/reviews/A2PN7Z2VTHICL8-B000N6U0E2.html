<meta name="summary" content="Rags to riches, but the story is mostly rags"></head><body><p>Based on a true story, 'The Pursuit Of Happiness' is the story of Chris Gardner (played by Will Smith) and the difficulties in his life prior to "making it".  His wife Linda (played by Thandie Newton (Crash)) just can't take the hardships anymore and leaves.  Chris is left with custody of his son Christopher (played by Smith's own son Jaden Smith).<br /><br />Chris suffers through many hardships, including eviction, staying in homeless shelters, tax collectors, and being jailed overnight for parking tickets.  He still manages to hang onto his son Christopher, even through devastating privation.  Chris is intent on selling a high end but spendy bone scanner machine to the medical community, but when his opportunity comes up to make a bid at becoming an employee of Dean Witter, he decides to go for it despite the unpaid time and attention it will take from his despairing life.<br /><br />Chris obtains a one in a lifetime shot, by hard work alone, to obtain the position he dreamed of.  But as one other reviewers put it, we never get the chance to see Chris on the high end of his hard work.  The movie would have been better if it had shown the results of Chris's dedication and determination.  Instead, we're left in the darkness of his becoming, with a few on-screen announcements intended to satisfy our need for closure of Chris's troubles.<br /><br />While very well done, the movie only earns three stars from me because of the abrupt ending.  It's one thing to document someone's hardship, but if (as in real life as the movie portrays) there is a happy ending, then the movie should include the happy ending.  I didn't sit through all this anguish for nothing.  Worth a rent, it's up to you for a purchase.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

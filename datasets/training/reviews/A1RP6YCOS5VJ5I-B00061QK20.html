<meta name="summary" content="Amazing"></head><body><p>"Hero" is another visually amazing film from Asia. The entire cast is excellent in this period-piece, but the beautiful scenery and choreography steal the film. From the mountains to the costumes, the film is just beautiful. The story is well written even though some things are predictable. Even though many films have been similar to this one, it still has something that makes it it's own. Some of the things in this film I have never seen any where else. If you love recent martial arts films, then you owe it to yourself to check this one out. It's as good as it looks</p></body></html>

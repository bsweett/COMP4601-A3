In "Open Range" he makes a smart move pairing himself opposite Robert Duvall who wisely reincarnates his performance as Augustus McRae from "Lonesome Dove".  There is no one of his generation who acts as well beneath a cowboy hat, and the movie would have been weaker with any other casting choice.<br /><br />There is much made of the Western as an art form.  The "Classic American Western" has reached as far as Italy and Japan with Sergio Leone and Kurosawa making films clearly imprinted with the stamp of John Ford.  It's difficult to say why the Western is so enduring, or at least so revivable, but I have a theory. There's something about a couple of adversaries facing each other out in a dusty street where frontier justice can be dispensed with a Colt revolver.  The genre is replete with examples (High Noon, Unforgiven, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and I'll stop there since I'm using up space, but you get the idea...) Anyway, Costner understands it too, and this movie tells a good tale while staying true to the form of the genre. It trots out a good half-dozen western cliche's such as the greedy cattle baron who doesn't wan't any stinkin' free-rangers out on his prairie.  It's hard to not like a movie that pays such tribute to the giants that preceded it, and does it so well.</p></body></html>

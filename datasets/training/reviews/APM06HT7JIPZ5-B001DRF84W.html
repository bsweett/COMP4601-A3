<meta name="summary" content="Good, but Not Great."></head><body><p>I wanted desperately to see this movie, and even wrote a review on amazon.com stating my enthusiasm.  Well, I must admit, it was worth the wait and hype . . . . . . sort of.<p>HULK is a difficult movie to review.  It has so many ups and downs that it comes off as one of those films you simply can't place your finger (or opinion) on.  I'll just make it easier and take it in random sections.<p>The acting was great.  Eric Bana perfectly embodied the emotionally bottled-up Bruce Banner, and he is quite powerful and moving at times.  Jennifer Connelly is an Academy Award winner, and that sort of speaks for itself.  It's awesome to see Sam Elliot back on the screen again; he is, needless to say, perfect, especially for the role of a military general.  And Nick Nolte is . . . . . well, Nick Nolte.  His role in this film was a very strange and unsettling one, a role that when placed in the hands of almost any other actor would've destroyed the entire movie.  But Mr. Nolte does one helluva job at it, and he's a thrill to watch.<p>The action was absolutely riveting!!  I feel somewhat strange saying this, considering the fact that this is obviously meant to be a character study above anything else, but the action scenes were the highlight(s) of the film.  Oh, and I've heard countless people complain about the special effects.  I can only guess they were basing their opinions on the Superbowl trailer, because the stuff I saw on the big screen was spectacular.  True, at times it really does show, but for the most part it's some of the best stuff I've ever seen.  And for all you dorks who ranted on about how stupid it was to do the Hulk in CGI, well you've been watching that old TV show too much and not reading enough of the comics.  HEEELLOOOOOOOOOOO???!!??!  The Hulk IS fifteen feet tall, and he CAN leap that far, and I'd be impressed beyond belief if they could pull that off by just painting some beefed up guy green!  (Note: Do not conclude from all this that I do not enjoy the old TV show; it was, in fact, a very well-done series, and watching that old painted Hulk ( I forgot his name) was always very entertaining.)<p>It's kind of like the FX work in SPIDER-MAN, as in the CGI is realistic enough (more so in HULK) to convince, yet at the same time it perfectly captures the sense of a comic book to satisfy comic fans.  All this is put into action even more efficiently in HULK, because of the use of pannels on screen (exactly like you would find in a comic book).  However, the filmmakers far too often overuse this technique.  Seeing the Hulk leaping onto a helicopter from three different angles is really cool, but watching a man walking down a hallway from three different angles is just plain pointless.  The trick does, overall, prove to enhance the viewing experience, mainly the action scenes.<p>Now for some more cons.  I'm dismayed even more with the music by Danny Elfman, whose score for HULK was equally as bland and uninvolving as his work in SPIDER-MAN.  This troubles me, considering the fact that Elfman is (or used to be) one of the greatest in the field of film music!  I can only hope he improves in the future.<p>Now I come to the worst part of the film: the ending.  It just totally fell apart!  It was both confusing and disturbing, with Nick Nolte going more than a little psycho.  And the final image I found to be just plain stupid; it's whole purpose was to tell us that a sequal was on the way, and it was very choppily done.  On the other hand, it is very nice to know that there is at least one sequal on the way, as there are so many elements of the film left unexplained.  But I guess I shouldn't be all that surprised; disappointed to be sure, but how else could a project like HULK end?  It's so huge and massive that it could not help but topple over in the end, and completely collapse under its own weight.<p>So, there you have it.  Totally mind-blowing action, some very dramatic moments, great acting, and spectacular special effects.  On the other hand, a bland score, far too much hinting on what is hidden inside Banner during the beginning of the film, and a trashy ending.<p>Overall, definitely worth seeing in theaters (it would be a crime not to), but don't go in expecting the bravura that was SUPERMAN, or anything.</p></body></html>

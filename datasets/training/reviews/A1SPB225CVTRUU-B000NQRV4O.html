<meta name="summary" content="Natalie Portman gets Closer to you."></head><body><p>While I was watching this movie, I was constantly reminded of We Don't Live Here Anymore(Mark Ruffallo, Laura Dern, Naomi Watts, and Peter Kruse) that came out earlier this year. It's also a movie about 2 couples dealing with infidelity. I must say I enjoyed We Don't Live Anymore only because Laura Dern delivered another "career best" performance. Closer is better story, direction is fine, and the all star cast is superb, especially the never been better Natalie Portman playing a striper. She's gone beyond her other good works including Anywhere But Here and Where The Heart Is.<br />Alice(Portman) met Dan(Jude Law) on the street of London when she got hit by a car, and they instantly became an "item". Dan has a thing for Anna(Julia Roberts), a photograper who likes to shoot strangers at the London Aquarium. She rejects Dan, because he's already with Alice. He uses her name and e-chat with a cyber sex freak/doctor named Larry(Clive Owen), and set up a date with him at the aquarium. Anna happens to be there when the horny doctor showed up. It was actually Anna's birthday, and depite the fact that she knew it was Dan who set the date up, she instantly clicked with Larry, and they also became an "item".<br />Time goes by, and passion fades, one member of the couples falls out of love. Anna secretly screw around with Dan after getting married with Larry. Dan decided to dump Alice, because she's not good enough or not woman enough to stimulate him. Alice was devastated and took off. Anna eventually  had to tell Larry her secret, because she couldn't stay with him anymore. Larry agreed to get divorced if she would let him "indulge" her body one more time.<br />Larry accidently ran into Alice in the strip joint and he paid her lots of money to have her strip for him and wanted to take her home and love her...<br />Upon knowing that Anna had slept with Larry again, Dan was furious and wanted to dump her, despite the fact that she love him more than Larry. Anyways, who will stay with whom at the end, I will not spoil it for you.<br />The overexposed Jude Law's character is the least likeable in this film, and somehow his performance is not as convincing like the way Portman(Alice) thinks of his love for her. Maybe it's the immaturity and insecurity of his role that makes me feel that way.<br />Clive Owen is pretty good, even though he has less screen time. He's more likeable compared to Law, because he's character is more realistic and honest.<br />This is probably Julia Robert's most serious role since Erin Brockovich. Unfortunately, her character lacked the heart and depth that was in Portman's role.<br />Natalie Portman gives the best performance in this movie and it's very likely going for an Oscar in the best supporting actress cateogory. She's very vulnerable and convincing, and the most likeable character in this movie. She gave her all and ultimately stole the movie from Julia Roberts.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A fun little indie"></head><body><p>Little Miss Sunshine is a pleasant, humorous, well-cast romp of a film.  It tries to hard to be that kind of non-PC that is actually so-PC today that it can cause the occasional eye-roll, but it still brings on the chuckles and moves a long with a great open good-heartedness. All the actors here do a fine job - Kinnear in particular considering the lack of attention he's recieved comparared to others in the cast.  A very pleasant and enjoyable film, but certainly not a classic or Oscar-worthy piece of film making.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wait about 28 weeks to see this film..."></head><body><p>28 Weeks Later is a decent enough sequel, with solid storytelling and acting, but the overall feel and showing of the zombies like in the original was terribly lacking.<br /><br />As was alot of the pace of this movie. Lots of slow parts.<br /><br />Action sequences ranged from hairy and intense, to sometimes dull and hard to follow. The snipers and helicopter battles are the best. Needed much more of this type of serious action sequences to have made this a surefire winner.<br /><br />Overall, I didn't get the thrill and positive feelings afterward when leaving the theater as I did the original movie, or the best zombie movie ever made, the remake of 300's director, Zack Snyder's DAWN OF THE DEAD.<br /><br />This movie showed all of the earmarks of a classic zombie movie, but we felt overall somewhat came up short. We never heard of this director, but if this was his first big film, then for that we felt he did a good job.<br /><br />Good movie, but just not great.</p></body></html>

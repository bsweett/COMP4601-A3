<meta name="summary" content="An old-fashioned yet very modern vampire film...and so much more!  4.5 stars."></head><body><p>Finally coming to the little "art house" movie theatre in our city (Albuquerque) was a little Swedish film I had assumed I would have to see on DVD someday:  LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.  Thank goodness I was able to get in during its five-day run...it's a real treat.<br /><br />This is a horror movie that is also simply a romantic drama and sometimes a very dark comedy.  It hews closely to "vampire conventions" yet turns them pretty neatly on their heads at the same time.<br /><br />12 year old Oskar is a shy, weak awkward little boy.  Not surprisingly, he is prime target for school bullies and also nurses some pretty deep fantasies about exacting bloody revenge on his tormentors.  He drags through his colorless days (the film is set mostly in and around an apartment complex in a rundown suburb of Stockholm during the early `80s...and it's snowing ALL THE TIME) with little to interest him.  He lives with his mother, who doesn't seem to be home much, and only seems to enjoy occasional visits to his father out in the country.<br /><br />One day, some new neighbors move in next door.  A middle aged (closing in on old) man and a 12 year old girl, Eli.  I don't think I'm spoiling much if I let you know now that Eli is actually a vampire, and the old man is her Renfield, the human who takes care of her during the day and helps acquire blood.  While Oskar doesn't figure this out for a while, the viewer picks up on it pretty quickly.<br /><br />Here's what great:  the vampire in the film is stealthy, thirsty for blood and very strong (just like in all the "old school" vampire films).  She is also vulnerable to daylight, and her bite, if you aren't killed by being completely drained and having your neck broken, will turn you into a vampire.  There's none of the toying around with what defines a vampire as we've seen in the last couple of decades worth of vampire films.  Yet the movie shows us Eli as a person who is capable of human vulnerabilities and most importantly, human caring, loyalty and affection.<br /><br />The film shows us the slowly developing friendship between Oskar and Eli.  These scenes are handled with great delicacy and if you took out all the vampiric elements, you'd still have a nice story about the blossoming friendship / love between two lost 12 year olds.<br /><br />The film also shows us just how mundane the details of being a modern vampire are.  The acquiring of blood, the darkening of windows in a modern apartment, etc.<br /><br />And when there are bursts of violence, they are thrilling in their abruptness and ferocity.  The sound editing is great, and while the movie shows you very little of what is happening, you don't feel like it is skimping either.  You are able to conjure up all you need to give yourself a decent case of the willies.<br /><br />The two young actors in the lead (Kare Hedebrant as Oskar and Lina Leandersson as Eli) are terrific.  They are very natural and unforced...they feel NOTHING like Hollywood child actors.  They are not perfect physical specimens...but the both exude a particular brand of innocence that can only come from a child just barely, but not quite, pushed over into adolescence.  Even the bullies in the film, while certainly not carefully fleshed out, are not cardboard characters.  They are all the more menacing because they seem completely possible.<br /><br />This movie will make you laugh as you shudder.  It will make you feel warm and sentimental, even when something brutally violent is happening.  There is nothing simple about this seemingly simple story.<br /><br />It is VERY slowly paced.  While it held my interest throughout and certainly captured me emotionally, I must also admit to a little squirming in my seat from time to time.  Part of it stems from the fact that the movie is set in such a bleak time and location.  Snow falling on gray, industrial looking dwellings and schools.  A washed out palette was used overall, and this made the film seem oppressive.  While very effective and highly believable, that isn't necessarily the stuff that ENJOYMENT is made of.  But these feelings were fleeting and only sporadic.<br /><br />This is a somewhat challenging film, not just because you have to read subtitles (which frankly shouldn't be considered a challenge at all), but because it demands that you see the world from a slightly different point-of-view and to show sympathy for a vampire and a 12 year old boy with murder in his heart.  But if you remember that this is, after all, fiction...I don't think you'll have any moral qualms.  I didn't!<br /><br />There are many more elements that come up later in this film, but I don't want to hint at them for fear of spoiling its many pleasures for you.  Just suffice it to say that if what you've read above intrigues you about the film...you won't regret seeing it.  For me, one test of the worth of a film is if I find myself thinking about it days later.  It's been awhile since I saw LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, and I can still feel many of its moods and picture many of its scenes as though I had just walked out of the theatre.  By that measure, and many others, this film is a great success and highly recommended.</p></body></html>

Andre Dubus III attempted to address the question in the novel House of Sand and Fog. Vadim Perelman attempted to make Dubus III's attempt into a movie. While neither was successful, the movie did a much better job of it than the book did.<p>Kathy (Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly [Phenomena, Dark City]) has been left by her husband, and is not in the best shape. When her house is seized for nonpayment of a bill that never existed in the first place, she's not too happy about it. While she's trying to get it back, the house is bought at a foreclosure sale by Colonel Behrani (Oscar winner Ben Kingsley [Sexy Beast, Suspect Zero]), an Iranian who had to flee the country with his family after the collapse of the Shah's regime. Kathy gets a well-meaning but unstable police officer (Ron Eldard [ER]) into the mix, and things start to go wrong fast.<p>Where Perelman's film improves (mightily) over the book is in giving us more of the Horatio Alger sense of the story-that both of these people, who have been wronged by their respective governments, deserve to triumph in the end. He brings out the parallels between the two in ways the book never achieved (a more malicious reviewer might say "ways Dubus never even thought of"). Unfortunately, however, first-time director Perelman is not a Hitchcock, able to take mediocre source material and turn it into great film. He does the best he can, to be fair. Ben Kingsley's performance here is a mighty one and well worth your renting the film. The problem is that everything else here pales in comparison. None of the characters is much worth caring about (as in the book), the pace is glacial (as in the book), and the basic stupidity of some of the characters' actions is way too far beyond the pale to be believed (as in the book).<p>Kingsley's performance is worth seeing. The rest of the movie can be safely dismissed as a very pretty piece of fluff. **</p></body></html>

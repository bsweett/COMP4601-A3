<meta name="summary" content="Genre of its own"></head><body><p>This movie is in a class of its own.  It would be difficult to say if this is coming of age movie, drama science fiction or a zombie movie but it is a mix of all for sure.  Set in  1980s it is a story of five high school buddies determined to make their zombie movie.  Bad things happen along the way: one of the boys looses his mother in the accident in a factory where she works; there is an alien on the loose in the small town; and all of these events are interfering with the make of the teeneage zombie movie.<br /><br />It must have been a fun project for Steven Speilberg and his mentoree J. J. Abrams to make.  But do not expect high art.  It is simply a fun movie to watch with no strings attached.</p></body></html>

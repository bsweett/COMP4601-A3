<meta name="summary" content="Slightly Better Than Average Movie"></head><body><p>Movie about a group of people with individual "special" powers who are assembled to save the world.  It has some intersting visaual effects.  The plot, though not overly interesting does keep you guessing.  There are likeable characters in it.  Its good entertainment.  Something I would watch a time or two more.</p></body></html>

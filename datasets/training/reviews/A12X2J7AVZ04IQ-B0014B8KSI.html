<meta name="summary" content="Interesting film; Clooney is terrific!"></head><body><p>If it wasn't for the focus and assured performance by George Clooney, this film would've been baffling, at best. There are some time-shifts that are totally unexplained. Tony Gilroy's direction certainly kept the film intriguing at most levels, and Tom Wilkinson was remarkable in his supporting role. Tilda Swinton's character was not well-written, and a very complex character at that. There's no question that she's a brilliant actress, but there were some puzzle-pieces missing here. (That Oscar should've gone to Amy Ryan). So, my opinion is that "Michael Clayton" provides a lot of interesting tension and great acting, but the final result left me disappointed.  In an effort to understand the film, I watched the DVD commentaries, by director Gilroy and his brother, James, screenwriter. There was nothing said about development or motivation; rather, gratuitous niceness regarding the players involved.</p></body></html>

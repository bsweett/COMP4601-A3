<meta name="summary" content="Pacino is great"></head><body><p>Al Pacino stars as Dormer, an LA detective on assignment in remote Alaska.  He is there to help a local cop (Hilary Swank) find the killer of a teenage girl.  Dormer sufers from insomnia, due to the ever-present sunlight in the Alaskan summer; his nerves are frayed, he's strung-out, and he makes a big mistake.  He accidently kills a police officer, and blames the murderer.  That story would probably work except for one thing:  the girl's killer saw him do it.<br /><br />Pacino is outstanding as the morally conflicted cop who can't sleep.  Swank is good as the eager-beaver young cop who must deal with her own issues of right and wrong.  The weak link in the cast is Robin Williams, who plays the murderer, Finch.  We know he can be genuinely creepy, as he was in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007976T">One Hour Photo</a>.  It's too bad he didn't bring some of that spine-tingling excitement to this role.  He is much too low-key, comfortable, and cheerful.  The movie lacks suspense of any kind, due to Williams' nice-guy bad-guy.  Fans of Al Pacino will enjoy his profoundly moving performance, but those hoping for edge-of-your-seat suspense will be disappointed.</p></body></html>

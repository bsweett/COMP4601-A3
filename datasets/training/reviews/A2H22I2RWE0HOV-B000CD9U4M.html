<meta name="summary" content="New Or Old:  The Eternal Choice!  Depp & Buton Together Again"></head><body><p>Many fans of the 1971 Gene Wilder classic will find themselves picking at similiarities in this re-telling of Roald Dahl's Charlie And The Chocolate Factory.  Though Tim Buton claimed not to be an admirer of the original, I believe either he or Depp studied up on Wilder's performance.  Closer to the book than the original, there are still certain nuances, certain catch phrases that were not garnered from the book.  Depp's Wonka is a little bit scarier, a little more messed up than the Wilder version.  You get the feeling in places that he and Hannibal Lecter might get along together...Depp is that creepy in places, almost too emotionally damaged.  Overall a stunning Burton vision if there ever was one.  A little predictable...duh?  Is Depp classic here?  Yes.  Is it better than the original?  That's the million dollar question.  Childhood nostalgia clouds the answer for me.  My kids loved it and they love the old one, too.  Score there.  Overall, I enjoyed it tremendously.  Depp's over-the-top performances are always fun to watch.<br /><br />Dig it!</p></body></html>

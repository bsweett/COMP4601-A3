<meta name="summary" content="Movie of the emotions and mortality of the day"></head><body><p>This isn't a movie about why or how as much as it is a movie of the 18th and 19th survivors pulled from the wreckage.  Oliver Stone did an excellent job of showing how this fateful day effected two Port Authority Officers and their families with such intensity that my wife had to take a break, it was really a lot to take in.  The movie was well done, the actors were on top of their game, even in a difficult situation that they were given.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Faithful to a fault"></head><body><p>This version may be more faithful to Roald Dahl's classic tale, but there wasn't as much life in those everlasting gob stoppers as I would have imagined.  Depp deftly captures Willie Wonka and Burton creates a vivid set of images of the novella, but the movie looked too much like a picture book and failed to create the tension and thrill of the story the way the original version with Gene Wilder did. This movie is amazingly somber and dull, with the characters walking gingerly over the sets, afraid it seems to touch the world Burton has created.  He turns each scene carefully over, like one would do in a pop-out children's book.  The kids are faithful restorations of those in the novel, when Burton could have updated them and given them far more spunk.  Anyway, the film is a visual treat with some fun side stories like Wonka's discovery of the Oompa Loompas.</p></body></html>

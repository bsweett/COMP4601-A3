<meta name="summary" content="OH ALEXANDER I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU SUCH A PINCH!!!!"></head><body><p>ALEXANDER--simply appalling bio of Alexander the Great that stinks on EVERY possible level from story construction to understanding of history to costumes to acting(Colin Farrell has to be smelled to be believed) Angelina Jolie plays with snakes and has a Russian accent.<br /><br />  The film is WILDLY homosexual themed with the Macedonians being portrayed as a bunch of hysterical garishly dressed Gays right out of LA CAGE AU FAUX. While I do not understand AT ALL what Oliver Stone was about here he DID beat BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN by months on the Gay Agenda train. One is surprised he did not get the credit. Oh and Alexander was murdered by a conspiracy here just for those who are interested. Ah Oliver Stone. Film still stinks though.<br /><br />  Stay with the Burton/Cushing version.</p></body></html>

The extremely disgusting appearance of John Travolta dressed up as a woman (and not a very believable one either), the overabundance of singing and dancing segments that come across very obnoxiously several times, and the overall fakeness of the entire thing (and I never really could tell whether they were mocking Baltimore or not).<br /><br />When it comes down to it, I can't get into the movie because all the things I mention above are just too much to tolerate for me.  Maybe for most people this kind of stuff is entertaining, but to me it's just not a funny style of comedy.  If you like singing and dancing "plays", then check it out.  If not, skip it.</p></body></html>

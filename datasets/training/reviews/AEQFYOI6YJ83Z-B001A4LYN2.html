I usually start with a summary of whatever I'm reviewing (movie, book, CD), and then go into my thoughts on it.  But how do I summarize this movie?  Daniel Plainview becomes an oil man and is determined to keep his position, no matter what the cost?  Anyone who's seen this film can tell you that such a statement barely summarizes the plot of "There Will Be Blood."<br /><br />The movie isn't really about plot, anyways.  I mean, it's there, yes; it's a hell of a story, loosely based upon Upton Sinclair's outstanding 1927 effort, "Oil!".  But even "Oil!" wasn't so much about plot as it was about a social concern (as were most, if not all, of Sinclair's novels).  "There Will Be Blood" (it is definitely Paul Thomas Andeson's movie; he wrote it, he directed it; it doesn't feel much like an adaptation at all) is more about humanity, about one character's "growth" (I use the term lightly) as he succumbs further and further to his greed.  Daniel Plainview, as portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis (who thoroughly deserves the Best Actor trophy he took home for this), is a downright evil man.  We are given little motivation for his evil (aside from greed; but we all suffer from that, don't we?) nor should we be given one.  I have heard people complain that the movie is dark, that it is uncomfortable to watch, that it has no redeeming features.  This is all true--thank God.  It is an honest portrayal of a dishonest man, and never once succumbs to the pressure to be a box office sensational feel-good film.<br /><br />I should say a little bit about other aspects of the movie, although if you've already seen it then such a rehash is pointless, and if you're curious about watching it you're already convinced one way or the other.  Paul Dano, as Plainview's "nemesis" (be warned: such terminology does not apply in a film such as this), is a wonder as always.  Why I've never heard of him, outside of "Little Miss Sunshine," I do not know, and is something I aim to rectify.  Kevin J. O'Connor, as Plainview's long-lost brother, is impressive; we can forgive him his turn as the comic relief in cheesy-yet-enjoyable horror fare such as "Van Helsing" and "The Mummy."  Dillon Feasier, as Plainview's adoptive son, is mesmerizing; it's rare you find a child actor with that much depth.  The scenery also becomes a star of the film; shot in part where the recent "No Country For Old Men" was filmed (Anderson and the Coen Brothers would occasionally disrupt one another's filming), the landscape awes and captivates.  The musical score underlies the depth of the film--something that's been rare in Hollywood, though as of late has been making something of a comeback.<br /><br />Have you made up your mind yet?  I can't blame you if you don't feel like seeing this movie; I was skeptical myself at first.  Even after the film, I had to think a while.  It wasn't until after a month or so that I decided that not only did I enjoy this movie, but that it is one of my favorites.  It's not an easy thing to watch, I'll admit.  Greed is one of humanity's curses; it's a primitive desire, but a powerful one.  "There Will Be Blood" is a dark, haunting look at one man's submission to his greed--and the life that it takes him through.</p></body></html>

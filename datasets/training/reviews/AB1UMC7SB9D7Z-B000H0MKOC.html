By that I mean that it's not necessarily original or profound, new or amazing in technique, or really that important.  Yet it's a decently written, well-acted observational satire, one that can give or take depending on what you want to receive or expect from it.  The trailer gives away some of its best jokes, we know that "everyone will become a better person at the end," and there's nothing really offensive in it.  Yet it's still, if anything, a great way to pass your time if you have the opportunity to see it.<br /><br />Frankly, this is the type of movie that Hollywood SHOULD be making while the medium-sized movie (AKA Indies by those who don't know better, AKA Indiewood, AKA movies with stars that aren't expected to be blockbusters) should be attempting something "different."  Instead, we have Hollywood making complete crap, medium-sized movies making the well-done formulas like this, and the really independent films trying to make the midsized movie, but with the unfortunate side-effect of selling the frankly ugly and annoying handheld camera effect as, "that grainy independent feel."<br /><br />But enough about the shoulda coulda woulda.  This, a highly comic and entertaining feature by Jason Reitman, is about a guy named Nick Naylor who must defend Big Tobacco against a nation of health warnings, fear of cancer, anti-big-business terrorist groups, and basically everyone in the nation who frankly hates him as a person even though he's a decent, caring guy who really just cares about taking care of his son.  What keeps this movie flowing and interesting is its comedic timing, a lot of nice quotables and one-liners that keep the audience at least amused until it finally is able to show the character express what's really on his mind: the importance of personal responsibility towards everything, even morally questionable businesses.  For all the talk and spin, Naylor never really says, "Smoke cigarettes", he says, "Make your own decisions."  The unfortunate thing is that in order to make a living saying that, he has to do it under the name of Big Tobacco.<br /><br />I, personally, love any movie that's willing to tackle issues of media and able to do it without being condescending or terribly misinformed.  That's where a lot of this film's strength lays, in its ability to analyze public relations and various forms of media as they operate without really being all, "Da Media is trying to kill you oh noes!"  This movie has some very important lessons to show in terms of understanding spin, how it works, and also understanding that sometimes the talking heads are real people too.  However, what really keeps it from being "brilliant" or "progressive" or anything like that is the fact that it really needed to have come out about fifteen years ago or thereabouts.  Nowadays such subjects are pretty much common discourse.  At least this movie has the ability to humanize it and make us empathize with someone we've been taught to hate.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB</p></body></html>

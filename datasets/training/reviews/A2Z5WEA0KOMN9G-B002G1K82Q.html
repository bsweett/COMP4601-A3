<meta name="summary" content="Pleasantly Surprised..."></head><body><p>I'm not a huge Beatles fan, but I like their music and this movie was recommended from a Pink Floyd board that I visit.  I wasn't sure what to expect as I was going into this movie.  But I liked the way that they used the Beatles songs.  I also liked the cinematography in this movie.<br /><br />I liked the way that this movie portrayed the 60's.  And I was kind of surprised that it didn't show the protesters as being all lily white.<br /><br />Anyways, good movie.</p></body></html>

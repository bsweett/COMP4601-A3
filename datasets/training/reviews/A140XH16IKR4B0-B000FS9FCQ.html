<meta name="summary" content="A Phenomenal Adaptation"></head><body><p>Reading "V for Vendetta" (the graphic novel) was such an overwhelming experience that one could be forgiven for wishing fervently that a movie adaptation *not* be made. But the Wachowski Brothers have done a fantastic job of bringing the story to cinema.<br /><br />The story's main elements are here. Britain is a police state controlled by a fanatical and puritanical elite. The media is nothing but the propaganda arm of the government. And it is a government with much to hide. Into this repressive atmosphere comes "V," a terrorist bomber who wears a Guy Fawkes mask, black cape, broad brimmed hat, leggings and gloves, who spouts Shakespeare while staging elaborate explosions. The government needs to track him down before another "November, November, the fifth of the November" arrives, with more detonations and (more important) the possible toppling of their rule.<br /><br />Lovers of the graphic novel will recognize most of the main plot elements, which shall not be detailed here but which involve nazi-like concentration camps, medical experiments on humans and an attempt to suppress all but the most banal art and literature. A few plot and character changes tweaks don't disrupt the overall flow of the film. Evey, V's young protege, played with great expressiveness by Natalie Portman, is much smarter and more self-aware than in the novel. The number of government characters and spurned lovers, so hard to keep track of in the novel, have been pared down and made more recognizable.<br /><br />Most importantly, many of the novel's messages and insights have been retained -- the population pacified with a constant stream of TV amusements; the fear based on lies; the deep-seated need for freedom, the love of beauty, whether literary, religious or musical or visual. The parallels to the present are intentional. The only thing of any consequence that was missing (as far as I could tell) was the name of Alan Moore, who wrote the novel. "V" purists will no doubt dislike the ending, where most of the film's changes occur. Because of the paring down of extraneous characters, necessary actions have been shifted to other characters. Most of these shifts become apparent in the last 1/2 hour of the film. I'm no purist, and I thought this worked well.<br /><br />"V for Vendetta" is well worth the watch -- it is finely-crafted, well-written and superbly acted. Hugo Weaving (Elrond in Lord of the Rings) as "V" never showed his faced, but conveyed a broad range of emotions. His voice, soft and lyrical, yet capable of conveying menace, was perfect. And Stephen Rea, as the conflicted Inspector Finch, gave a restrained and effective performance.<br /><br />The DVD extra were mainly limited to a short "making of" feature that included so-so interviews with the actors and a few behind he scenes shots showing wire work and rehearsals. Nothing earth-shattering. While not completely conveying the darkness, sense of dread of the book on which it was based, nor its complexity, nor the mad lust for vengeance that propelled V on his murderous rampage, "V for Vendetta" was about as perfect an adaptation as could be hoped for. Readers of the novel should see the movie, and movie viewers should read the novel to get the full effect of this marvelous ode against the excesses of authoritarians and the fear that puts them, and keeps them, in power.</p></body></html>

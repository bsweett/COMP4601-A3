For a movie that starts with so much promise, this sure turns into Bollywood in about 30 minutes.<br /><br />Danny Glover sports a lisp. The plot sports a brain malfunction. Politicians are easily located and live in houses that are sorely under-guarded, their meager protection coming from patently inept soldiers who cannot shoot straight, ever. The music and direction are painfully juvenile, such as a heavy metal backdrop with drums and cymbals when our oh-so-cool protagonist, suitably named Bob Lee Swagger, drops a clever line and swaggers away in slow motion with his shades on.<br /><br />This protagonist and his whiz partner (suitably Hispanic, to cater to a global audience, because the African American crowd was already covered with the villain, and the Chinese/oriental with an FBI agent) go on to jointly defeat an army of about a hundred soldiers who're heavily armed with machine guns and everything else. The massacre takes place around a house, completely surrounded, but not to worry. Our hero has some real killer stuff that he and his pot-bellied aide have pulled together from groceries from the local supermarket, such as salt, sugar, and straw. There was also a plier, which should have greatly helped.<br /><br />Then there's the scene on the top of a rather high snow-capped mountain where snipers are conveniently located and camouflaged in white fur, waiting for a certain helicopter to arrive before they start shooting each other. How did they get there in the first place? Perhaps they were serious rock climbers and spent two days to get to the peak, or of course, they could have been escorted in a cable car. Failing that, if the only plausible alternative was to take a helicopter or some other aerial route, how was it that they did not spot each other earlier?<br /><br />Action trumps logic here.  The villains are cardboard evil, never really striking any meaningful chord of fear. Wahlberg, who was stunning in The Departed and still manages to contribute the screen presence in this farce, really ought to reconsider doing these B-grade movies before he becomes the new Van Damme. The exploding bombs and energetic car chases may appeal to a couple of freckled teenagers, but overall it's a predictable mess of a film.</p></body></html>

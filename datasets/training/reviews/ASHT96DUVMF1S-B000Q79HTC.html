<meta name="summary" content="Same story with NEW twist"></head><body><p>Matt Damon plays the assassin whose government employer is trying to apprehend him.  Same worn out story line with a new twist this time the assassin has amnesia.  Matt plays an action character well.  I was entertianed and not bored.  My review is 3 stars because it lacks the orignality that makes a movie great. It possess a number of very interesting scenes and is worth a view.</p></body></html>

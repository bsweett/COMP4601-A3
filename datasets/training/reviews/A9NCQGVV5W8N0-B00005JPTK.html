<meta name="summary" content="A Lacklustre Treatment Of A Classic Novel...."></head><body><p>As a standalone last-man-on-earth movie or a remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0BU">The Omega Man</a> , 'I Am Legend' is a film of two halves. The first half, I was pleasantly surprised to discover, is very good indeed and doesn't concede to the big guns, explosions and one-liner forumula popularised by the Bruckheimer and Simpson school of Blockbuster movie-making; In keeping with the novel, what you have is the laconic introduction of a man going about an ordered routine in a world in which order has ceased to have meaning. The first section of the film, prior to the first appearance of the living human infected (and minus some dodgy CGI deer and a CGI lion that looked like it had padded into frame from the film, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNX0">Madagascar (Widescreen Edition)</a> ) is nothing short of breathtaking. The vistas of an empty New York slowly returning to nature are the best CGI that I've seen since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N6TX1I">Children of Men (Widescreen Edition)</a> largely because, bar the opening shots, they borrow a trick from that film in not dwelling on the landscapes with the obligatory "look at our cool effects, kids!" shots. Because of the ordinariness with which they're treated one doesn't relate to them as an effect.  Smith's performance as Bob Neville is, thank the lord, note perfect. The unspoken dread in his eyes as he's washing his canine companion in the bath-tub and waiting for the sun to set is palpable and, I take my hat off to him, he deserves an Oscar for the strength and subtlety of his performance here. Films like this are carried by their actors and this is a spectacular performance. Not the best of its kind - that accolade still goes to the late, great Bruno Lawrence in the brilliant <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZ908Y">The Quiet Earth</a>  - but certainly in the top five. However, the scene which is the film's greatest triumph is also its greatest tragedy. Namely, when Neville is forced to chase his dog into a darkened building and we're treated to a bravura sequence in which he unequivocally panics as he tracks around darkened corners with his rifle. We, the audience, know that the human infected - whom we still haven't seen - are going to jump out on him. And they do. And when they do, they are unfortunately completely unconvincing as anything other than a special effect - and not a particularly convincing special effect at that - at which that point all of the carefully accrued tension dissipates and the audience finds itself firmly in rubbery Matrix CGI country. Make no mistake about it, if Francis Lawrence had opted for human performers in make-up (of the like seen in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TJBN80">28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>  and Zack Snyder's superb <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ABURA">Dawn of the Dead (Widescreen Unrated Director's Cut)</a> remake) rather than CGI, it would have probably have been the most terrifying piece of big-budget horror film-making in recent history. In fact, one wonders whether the budget wasn't the deciding factor in making the human infected CGI, as the audiences awareness of them as a special effect drastically reduces the level of horror which would probably have garnered the film an R17/18 rating; something which would have prevented vast swathes of the audience demographic from seeing it and probably would have spelled box office doom given the millions involved. From then on, the film marches steadily on to a denouement which is hurried, rather limp and a complete juxtaposition to the dark themes of the novel. If you're a fan of the novel, you're not going to see it here. The only resemblance to it is the title, the name of the protagonist and, superficially, the situation. Neville is no longer a borderline-alcoholic, blue-collared schmoe barely managing to contain his own self-destructive urges. The scientific examination of the vampire myth that made the book so fascinating is not here. Neither is the final heart-breaking inversion of Neville's plight which so haunted me when I read it as a thirteen year old. Suffice to say, despite three official screen interpretations and numerous unofficial interpretations, the definitive version of this massively influential novel is still to be made. One day, maybe Hollywood will realise that this is one story that doesn't need a rewrite or eye-candy to bolster what is already a supremely haunting and still frighteningly relevant tale.</p></body></html>

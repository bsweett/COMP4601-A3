<meta name="summary" content="A cinematic mixed bag"></head><body><p>The Day After Tomorrow impressively wowed me with terrific special effects, yet came up way short as a movie worthy of classic status.  The scientific concepts behind the appocalyptic disasters pictured in the movie were fascinating but not on a scale of say Jurassic Park.  This was basically a heavily advertised holiday released disaster movie which succeeded in generating major revenue.<p>The acting performances were not noteworthy and the dialogue was incredibly thin.  A passionless, Dennis Quaid proved himself to be a B level actor, playing Jack Hall a paleo-climatologist.  Sela Ward playing his wife was mere window dressing in the film.  The love story between Quaid's son Jake Gyllenhaal and Emmy Rossum was sophomoric and added little to the plot.<p>The special effects alone made the movie entertaining but not enough to make it memorable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Don't hold the skeleton key."></head><body><p>Caroline is studying to become a nurse. She stayed with a patient, Mr. Talcott, who died while she read him a nice story. Caroline felt the hospital was so insensitive by how quickly they wanted the body to be removed out of the room and they wanted her to put his boxes of personal belongings in the dumpster instead of passing them on to the next of kin.<br />Caroline decides to quit her job and accept a new job as a caretaker at the Terrebonne Parish Manor outside of New Orleans.  There she meets the Estate lawyer (Peter Sarsgaard) and Violet (Gena Rowlands),the wife of the man, Ben (John Hurt) who apparently had a stroke up in the attic where they found him.  Violet isn't too keen of having a stranger as a caretaker for Ben.  She says that Caroline won't "understand the house".  Caroline will have to live in this house, located in the swampland, while Ben needs tending too.<br />  Violet gives Caroline a skeleton key that will open up 30 rooms in the manor.  Only half are used.  She sends Caroline to the attic for some seed packets.  Once in the attic, Caroline finds a hidden door that is moving a bit.  She puts the key in the door when suddenly another door she walked through slams open.  She quickly leaves the room without knowing why the hidden door is trying to reopen.<br />  There are many mysteries in this house that Caroline will have to find.<br />  In Bonus Features, Kate Hudson tells her personal ghost story about when herself and her mother, Goldie Hawn, were in London.<br />  John Hurt also recites you a ghost story, in his talented, dramatic way.<br />  Gena Rowlands will read you a spell for love and friendship.</p></body></html>

And this time it's been done with a prequel that goes all the way back to Hannibal's childhood, a story that I - and probably quite a few other fans - wasn't sure was a good idea to tell.  Didn't the excellent "Red Dragon" reveal enough of Lecter's backstory?  Was going back further going to do anything other than take away the air of mystery to the character?<br /><br />  Fortunately, "Hannibal Rising" only deepens the impact of the character and his previous films.  Beginning in World War II Lithuania, we see the deaths of young Lecter's family, not at the hands of Hannibal  himself, but by Nazis and a band of marauding Lithuanian ex-Nazi collaborators/turned 'freelance' looters and terrorizers.  Through a ghastly set of circumstances best left to be seen in the movie itself, the surviving Hannibal is found by the Russian forces moving in at the end of the war, a mute child wandering through the woods with a chain around his neck.  Raised in a Soviet orphanage, the amnesiac and still-mute Hannibal seemingly develops into an unlikely defender of the oppressed  ("You go against the way of nature, Hannibal", an orphanage official tells him, "Always hurting the bully"), Lecter eventually frees himself and makes his way across Europe to the residence of some disrant relatives, where the bulk of the movie takes place.  The older but still mute Hannibal (played by Gaspard Ulliel in the male breakout performance of the year so far) is cared for by the widow (Gong Li, another great performance in a highly well-acted movie) of his deceased uncle, later becoming more deeply involved with her.<br /><br />  It's upon regaining his memory of the events in the war that the transformation really begins.  The bloody path of Hannibal Lecter as we know him begins as revenge, but as we already know from the previous movies, it doesn't end there.  Hannibal ends up travelling from innocent child to a dark, violent avenger, to what he is when "Red Dragon" takes place (although "Hannibal Rising" wraps up many years before Dragon commences - maybe we haven't seen the last of the pre-Anthony Hopkins Hannibal).  As the end of Hannibal Rising nears, it enters extreme territory that makes the legendary 'banquet' scene from 2001's "Hannibal" look like a tranquil countryside brunch.<br /><br />  *WARNING - POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD*<br /><br />  In ways, we see Hannibal Lecter die twice in this movie.  The first is in the World War II Lithuanian winter, where the little boy effectively ceases to be, and begins the path to his new incarnation as a passion-driven dark avenger.  The second death though, the passing from avenger to psychopath, could be considered to be a metaphorical suicide (as opposed to the way his days as a happy child were 'murdered' when his family's lives were taken).  What drives Lecter to this point - and the violence with which this path begins: the death of one of the last surviving members of his family's killers, in a fashion so savage and shocking it outdoes anything in the previous three Lecter movies; makes his dispatching of previous guilty parties seem tame; and is enough to floor even the seasoned horror fan - is the kind of thing to stay with one, to haunt you long after the movie is over.  And with it the evil, fully-formed Hannibal Lecter, is truly risen.  Great stuff, managing to be on par with Anthony Hopkins's Lecter movies.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly good"></head><body><p>From Vincenzo Natali, the director of the original Cube, Splice is a curious offspring of horror and science gone wrong.  Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley star as two brilliant scientists whose experimentation with cross-breeding various brands of DNA result the creation of "Dren", whose rapid growth results in a devilishly and strangely seductive form (played by Delphine Chaneac).  For most of its running time, Splice is a thought provoking horror/thriller that delivers some genuine shocks and surprises, and is made all the better thanks to the performances of Brody and Polley.  Even Chaneac, though she never utters a word, makes what could be close to being a star-making turn as the monsterously sexy Dren.  Though it turns into a by-the-numbers chase towards the conclusion of the film, Splice is nevertheless entertaining and intelligent, and is more than worth your time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Hulk&quot;"></head><body><p>It has its moments and it can be flashy fun at times and very serious at others. But the movie is really a set up for hopefully &quot;Hulk 2&quot;. I say every comic book movie sould have at least two films. The 1st is the set up and the 2nd is all the fun you can have with the charecters, for example, &quot;X-Men&quot; and &quot;X2&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; ect. I hope there will be a &quot;Hulk 2&quot; because people can have more respect for &quot;Hulk&quot;. Overall a decent film with amazing effects and some boring parts. Give it a try. <p>Grade: B-</p></body></html>

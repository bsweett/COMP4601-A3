Minority Report amazed audiences during the summer and Catch Me If You Can giddily amused them during the winter.  Catch Me If You Can  chronicles the life of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a master con-artist who cashed bogus checks while passing himself off as a pilot, doctor, and lawyer.  While such a lifestyle may appear glamorous and exciting on the outside, the truth of the matter was that Frank was actually a sad and troubled teenager who could only maintain a relationship with two people in his life - his father (Christopher Walken) and the FBI agent pursuing him (Tom Hanks).  DiCaprio displays an impressive acting range as he moves from light and charming into brooding and distraught whenever the story calls for it.  Hanks in the role of Carl Hanratty hits another home run and proves himself once more to be the Jimmy Stewart of his generation.  His Hanratty is not the cliche law enforcement officer who obsesses over his prey day and night, but rather a complex father figure who feels that Abagnale can be salvaged from his life of crime.  As the pursuit drags on, Hanratty develops a respect, and then a concern, for Abagnale.  The growth of this relationship proves to be touching and amusing at the same time.  This film probably will not rank among the pantheon of the great Spielberg films, but it will definitely not diminish his legacy.  Catch it if you can!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="GOVERNOR'S BALL?"></head><body><p>You have to give Arnold credit---as he ages, he does so gracefully and although the lines and wrinkles on his face are noticeable, he manages to have a pretty buff body for a California governor.  Director Jonathan Mostow, who gave us "Breakdown" sets the pace extremely well in this no-nonsense, shoot em up, bang em up thriller.  Beautiful Kristina Lokken is a formidable foe for Arnie in this one, and she evinces both the menace and heartlessness of this killing machine sent back from the future to try and kill good old John Connor (Nick Stahl, this time).  Claire Danes as a pretty veterinarian assistant gets hooked into the fray, and it's non-stop action from there on.  Although this is an excellently done movie (the effects are mind-boggling), it may be time to retire this series, as it seems Connor is at the point in the movie where it all started a century ago!!!  But undeniably a butt-kicker!</p></body></html>

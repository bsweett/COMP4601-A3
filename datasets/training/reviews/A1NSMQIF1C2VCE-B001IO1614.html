<meta name="summary" content="Just another Day"></head><body><p>While Pierce Brosnan taking on the role of James Bond inarguably reinvigorated the franchise, in his latest outing as 007 he looks tired, and the film certainly feels like the creative staff agree.<p>There are some high points -- the use of North Korea, Bond in captivity, adventures in Cuba -- but the moment the film shifts to the wintery setting for its last half, it's as though we're watching Roger Moore circa &quot;Moonraker.&quot; The film becomes cliche, camping and outright silly, and even the ice palace -- clearly meant to be impressive -- just looks like a leftover from a cheap 1970s science fiction movie.<p>While I hope Bond is never fully retired, it feels like it's time to put the franchise on the shelf again for a decade or so, and let a new generation of creators find a way to make him the hero he's meant to be, and so often has been in the past.<p>Recommended only as a rental.</p></body></html>

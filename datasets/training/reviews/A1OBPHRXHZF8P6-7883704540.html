<meta name="summary" content="Enjoy this tasty 'family portion' this fourth"></head><body><p>Being a rat doesn't stop young Remy (Patton Oswalt) from knowing good food when he sees it. In fact, while his family and other rats are content to gnaw at whatever they get--literally including garbage, our young protagonist seriously dreams of becoming a famous chef!<br /><br />Unbeknownst to his family, Remy had been sneaking into the kitchen of their 'house'. He was studying the French cookbooks of the departed Auguste Gusteau. Diligence pays off when Remy helps the son of the deceased follow in his fathers' footsteps.<br /><br />Remy receives the dream of being able to cook, but the road to culinary fame is not without its bumps and internal squabbling from the chef and the human beneficiary of those talents. Remembering who your friends are is very important as is not leaving them when they have helped you achieve the success you always wanted.<br /><br />Those dramatic elements made the consistency of this family film much more appetizing for an adult palette in contrast to a screenplay where all of the 'good' characters conveniently have worked out issues before we see them. I had honestly thought the idea of a film about a rat cooking food was gross upon first hearing, but this multi-layered plot humanized the main character to the point where it became a non-issue.<br /><br />The animation and graphics are okay. Early in the screenplay, I figured out that it really wasn't the reason why I and other patrons need to be watching this film. Pixar's made lots of progress, but special effects ultimately were not the focus of the production team.<br /><br />Some people are going to find this script political/preachy (and could be offended by it). The studio is trying to encourage audiences to not give up on our dreams, regardless of the size of our obstacles or even what our family initially thinks of us for pursuing it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Powerful Story...Powerful Performance"></head><body><p>This is undoubtedly one movie that will stay with me for a long time. Adrien Brody's performance as Wladyslaw Szpilman was definately oscar worthy. The story is a touching reminder of what humans are capable of acheiving when fighting for survival. The fact that the film is directed by Roman Polanski who lived in the nazi 'era' made the story all the more real to the viewers. I also liked the way the story was told in that there were good and bad Jews, Poles and Germans. Often in the past one side was 'all bad' and the other side was 'all good.'</p></body></html>

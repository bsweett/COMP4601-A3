<meta name="summary" content="The Incredibles"></head><body><p>Times change, and superheros begin to have lawsuits filed against them.  When the burden is too much for the government to bear, the Incredibles are forced into retirement and into normal life through the "Superhero Relocation Program".  But, working as an insurance salesman doesn't hold the same thrill for Mr. Incredible/Bob Parr (Nelson), and he finds himself listening to the police scanner with another former superhero by the name of Frozone (Jackson).  That way they can still offer their help to the police.  When a mysterious stranger enters his life, Mr. Incredible finds himself presented with an opportunity to regain some of his lost glory.  Now, he is working on the sly with his wife (Hunter) unaware of what is going on, but a secret like that cannot be kept forever.<br /><br />With "The Incredibles", Pixar goes the way of the big studios by making a superhero movie.  Despite some similarity to the Fantastic Four, this idea works pretty well.  It is fun to see the out of shape Mr. Incredible stuff himself into his costume and fight the bad guys.  The cartoon violence ups the rating to PG (a first for a Pixar movie), but there is nothing too over the top here.  "The Incredibles" is not as good as "Toy Story" 1 or 2 or "Finding Nemo", but kids and adults alike are sure to enjoy the majic that Pixar brings to the screen.</p></body></html>

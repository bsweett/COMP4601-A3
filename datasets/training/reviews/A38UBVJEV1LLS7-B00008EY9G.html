"Identity" was a time that I really loved him. The movie is complex and confusing, but has an ending that actually answers all the questions brought to light, instead of leaving them to the viewer to decide what happened. Peet was a nice addition to the cast. A must see for mystery fans.<p>DVD is great so is the movie.</p></body></html>

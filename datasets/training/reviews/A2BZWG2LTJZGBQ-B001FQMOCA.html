I had no idea about his relationship with June Carter, or really any of his hit songs.  That being said, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit.  The portrait that Joaquin Phoenix paints of the classic singer is a troubled man who battled some of the usual demons that people in the spotlight often fight.  Booze, drugs, cheating on the spouse, and losing touch with the loved ones in the family, all of these plague Cash in the film.  Most of these things, like always are self imposed, and should be avoided.  It's interesting how much these things affect the famous in the world.<br /><br />Anyway, the performances are solid, especially Reese Witherspoon, who shines in her role as June Carter.  She spends most of her life in the limelight, working with Cash for lots of her adult life and eventually marrying him.  The film provides us information about their life together once it ends with her agreeing to marry him.  Witherspoon won the best actress Oscar for the role, well deserved.  She is always watchable in her movies and this was no exception.<br /><br />In short, I liked the film.  Not a movie I plan on watching repeatedly, but it was worth the time to see.  I recommend it highly, even if like me, you know little or nothing about the singer.  This film is worth the time invested.</p></body></html>

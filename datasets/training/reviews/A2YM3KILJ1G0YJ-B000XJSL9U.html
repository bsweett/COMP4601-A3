<meta name="summary" content="Charred, Scarred, Die Hard"></head><body><p>A mysterious figure named Thomas Gabriel in charge of a team of paramilitary cybercriminals finds a way to entice the world's best hackers to invoke a Fire Sale - an attack on the country's transportation, finance, then public works (what I like to call the Monopoly strategy) - in order to unleash his insidious master plan.  It's up to John McClane (Bruce Willis) to save the country, drop F-bombs, take a beating, and pick up Jedi hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long), the primary person responsible for making the Fire Sale possible.<br /><br />The flaws for this film are similar to Eagle Eye; there just happens to be too much nick-of-time, skin-of-the-teeth, missed by an inch fortune.  It's completely unfathomable, entirely impossible - regardless of how much background information is given on the genius and employment history of the primary antagonist - for a hacker, or team of hackers, to take over the entire Internet, telecommunication, DHS, NSA, FBI, CIA, and major power grids - evidently controlled by a Commodore 64 and administered by Windows ME - and even imagine the type of scheme attempted by Gabriel and his team, one of whom is the world's only Asian model/ninja/stunt-woman/computer hacker and another left Cirque De Soliel for a life of crime.  Despite the plot which left me incredulous, I thoroughly enjoyed Die Hard 4 because it's about action, not mundane reality.<br /><br />The acting from all three leads is top notch, as expected.  And why wouldn't it be?  Bruce Willis actually looks like a tough guy; Justin Long whines like a Jolt Cola drinking, World of Warcraft playing, basement dweller; and Timothy Olyphant cuts his eyes as a criminal mastermind like with the best of'em.<br /><br />The stunts are amazing.  Jets, trucks, and helicopters; mutilations, boxing, beatings, martial arts, and stair-diving; dorm room explosions, tunnel explosions, overpass explosions; it's the kitchen sink approach to action.<br /><br />If you need to be sold on this, you're probably in the wrong area.  Break out the popcorn and your suspension of disbelief, because Willis makes a triumphant return as McClane.  Yippee-ki-yay!!</p></body></html>

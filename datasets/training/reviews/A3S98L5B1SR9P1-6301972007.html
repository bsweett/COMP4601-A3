But a pretty girl walks into their office one day with a false name, a story full of holes and Archer's fate firmly in her grasp. When Miles falls victim to the ruse, it's up to Sam Spade to get to the bottom of it; even at the cost of his own reputation which is already severely in question. A greasy little worm named Cairo and a fat man weave a more complex tapestry of intrigue as Spade is led on a quest for "the stuff dreams are made of". With the success of "The Petrified Forest", Bogart appended his fame in tough gumshoe roles, much the same way as Edward G. Robinson established his at the same studio; with roles on the other side of the law. John Huston was to cross paths with him once more for a third and fourth effort in Technicolor, namely; "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" and finally "The African Queen". It may well be said that both Huston and Bogart gleaned the cream of their respective careers from each other, thus leaving a combined cinematic legacy unmatched by any other such combination of talent, and certainly giving Warner Brothers a cornerstone of integrity in the world of film. Particularly notable supporting performance from Lee Patrick as Spade's harried secretary.</p></body></html>

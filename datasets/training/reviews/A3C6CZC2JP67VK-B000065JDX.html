No lie I do like the film despite its unevenness. It was kind of hard for me to "switch gears" when it turned horror, but before long, I was into it. I think Clooney and Tarantino made a great on screen duo. I liked the way they were so opposite, even though they were brothers.<br /><br /> To me one of the BEST scenes in this film was when they have the female bank teller hostage in the motel. Clooney goes out for food (Anyone catch the bag from Big Kahuna Burger/Pulp Fiction?) and leaves Tarantino to watch the hostage. Upon his return, he finds that his brother has massacred the teller...they never show her dead...just split seconds of her body intertwined with the twitching expression of shock on Clooney's face. That scene said more than showing the victim could ever say. Now that's what I call a great moment in filmmaking! Towards the middle of the film Hayek does a lewd dance with a snake which probably make any mans shorts explode.<br /><br />My favorite line is when Clooney responds to Cheech Marin, "...Did they look like psychos?! Do psychos explode in sunlight?!..."  This is such a man's flick; I mean the reviewers here proves my case. From Dusk Till Dawn is action, camp, and horror all in one. And might I add, Clooney looks fab and that tattoo is pretty tight! I do like Quentin Tarantino's movies. This is no exception. It's filled with Quentin's wacky characters and twisted plot. This disc is a must for the die hard Tarantino fans or horror movie fans.<br /><br />P.S. The sequels are complete garbage stick to the original.</p></body></html>

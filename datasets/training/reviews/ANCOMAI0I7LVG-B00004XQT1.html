I have made my distain for this film obvious to many people but upon reflection even I must admit that the majority of its parts are pure brilliance.  And then the fourth quarter comes along and then entire film falls to pieces.  Honestly I don't think that Mary Harron understood Bret Easton Ellis' novel.  I am a huge fan of the book (I have it listed as one of the top five books everyone should own) and have learnt to embrace its controversial and disturbing overtones because underneath it all `American Psycho' (the novel) is a masterful depiction of humanity at its realist.  I know that it has been noted that Ellis' enjoyed this movie adaptation, and maybe that should mean something for me, but I still can't help but gawk at its overly comical ending.<br /><br />When you read `American Psycho' it gets under your skin; first because of the gross and graphic depictions of murder and mayhem, but ultimately it crawls beneath you because you begin to rationalize with inhumanity.  You begin to realize that this man is trapped, as are you and I, in a world that places so much value on the clothes we wear and the toys we own that the value of another's life is tragically degraded.  What garners more attention; the murder of a homeless man or a blowout sale at JCPenney?  The answer is as obvious as it is heartbreaking.<br /><br />Mary Harron's adaptation loses that for me.  In the end Patrick Bateman is degraded to the depiction of a crazed lunatic as apposed to the ultimate portrayal of a society lost.  He's made fun of as apposed to being made fear-inspiring.  I vividly remember an image of a crouched over Christian Bale feasting on human flesh and I remember shaking my head in disgust for what Ellis' brilliant work of modern literature had been reduced to.<br /><br />This has nothing to do with the fantastic acting within this film, which I feel compelled to point out.  Christian Bale serves up one of the greatest performances of his career and certainly one of the best of that given year (can you say Oscar snub).  He truly gets inside Patrick Bateman, residing within his delusions and creating a truly terrifying as well as understandable character.  Chloe Sevigny also delivers as Bateman's secretary Jean.  Her scene within his apartment, the scene with the nail gun, is my favorite scene in the film.  Reese Witherspoon is great here, if not underused, and Jared Leto has one of the most memorable scenes here (the one scene in the film that really crawled beneath my skin).<br /><br />You know, while I'm on that subject I might as well stay on that subject.  Jared Leto plays Paul Allen, one of Bateman's `victims'.  The murder scene is graphic yet done in a mesmerizing satirical way that truly captures what Ellis' novel was all about.  Why oh why could the climax of this film have been done in the same splendid manner?  I'm baffled because one scene is pure brilliance while the other is C-Grade cheesiness.<br /><br />I just want to throw my hands up in dire frustration.<br /><br />In the end I guess I'm forced to give this the thumbs down.  It could have been such a fantastic film; maybe even the best of the year.  The source material, while completely and understandably controversial and offensive, is one of the greatest and most influential novels to have ever been penned.  Mary Harron had a major opportunity here to build on greatness and deliver something the world has never seen.  A lot of critics praised this movie; which goes to show that I will never understand this society's idea of a critic.  It begins with such masterful potential and it builds on it with such fire only to freefall into stupidity and destroys everything it worked so hard to accomplish.  I give it three stars, nothing more and nothing less; which is sad because during its first three quarters I was so sure it would receive nothing but praise from me.  Bale is genius, I will give this movie that, but even his brilliance could not save this film from itself.</p></body></html>

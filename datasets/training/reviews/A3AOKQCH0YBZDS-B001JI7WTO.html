<meta name="summary" content="Great Special Effects"></head><body><p>I am a fan of Jules Verne, which is why I wanted to watch this movie. The special effects are fantastic and storyline is decent & fun throughout the movie. It is also action packed and this is good. I think this is a good movie for children too.<br /><br />The acting by Brendan Fraser is simply awful. The poor man can't act (in my opinion) and the rest of the cast was alright in terms of their acting skills.</p></body></html>

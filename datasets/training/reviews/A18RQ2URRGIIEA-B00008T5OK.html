Directed by Robert Wise (who also directed "The Andromeda Strain" in 1971, "The Day the Earth Stood Still" in 1951 and "West Side Story" in 1961), the film was derived from the Broadway musical created by Richard Rogers & Oscar Hammerstein II, in corroboration with writers Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse).  It was based upon the true story of the van Trapp family immediately prior to World War II.<p>Taking place in Salzburg, Austria in 1938, the film begins with a cinematically beautiful display of the Alps and Julie Andrews singing the title song.  Julie Andrews plays Maria, a young woman studying to become a nun; but Reverend Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) along with nuns Sister Margaretta (Anna Lee), Sister Bertha (Portia Nelson), Sister Sophia (Marni Nixon) and Sister Bernice (Evadne Baker) aren't sure whether Maria is suitable nun material.  Mother Abbess decides to send Maria on a mission to be a governess to the seven children of Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), a decorated hero of the Austrian Navy.  Captain von Trapp has had great difficulty finding a proper governess for his children, who frequently discourage any governess from remaining by using various pranks.  Initially, the children intend to treat Maria as any previous governess, but they quickly take a liking to her.  Upon discovering that the children have never sung before, Maria teaches them how to sing, to the unintended delight of Captain von Trapp's friend, Max Detweiler (Richard Haydn), who is searching for fresh musical talent.  However, Captain von Trapp does not intend to allow Max to exploit his children's previously unknown musical abilities.  Further, unexpected feelings develop between Captain von Trapp and Maria.<p>Complicating matters for Maria and the von Trapp family is the political atmosphere in 1938 Austria.  Some Austrians enthusiastically embrace the idea of Anschluss (political annexation) between Austria and Nazi Germany, but most (including Captain von Trapp) are totally opposed.  As history records, Nazi Germany takes control of Austria in 1938, and Germany's naval command wants Captain von Trapp to take command of one of its naval vessels.  Captain von Trapp instead decides to take his family to the safety of Switzerland.<p>Acting and singing in "The Sound of Music" are superb. Not only the abilities Julie Andrews (who received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress) eloquently showcased, but also those of Christopher Plummer and Peggy Wood (who received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress).  The young actors & actresses portraying Captain von Trapp's children are also very talented: Leisl (Charmian Carr), Louisa (Heather Menzies, who played Jessica in the 1977 TV series "Logun's Run"), Friedrich (Nicholas Hammand, who acted in many TV series including "The Amazing Spider-Man" as Spider-Man in 1978), Kurt (Duane Chase), Brigitta (Angela Cartwright, who also played Penny in the 1965 TV series "Lost in Space"), Marta (Debbie Turner) and Gretl (Kym Karath. who also played Maggie in the 1963 film "The Thrill Of It All").  Also putting in wonderful performances are Eleanor Parker as the Baroness, Ben Wright as Herr Zeller and Daniel Truhitte as Rolfe.<p>Songs from the film include:<br />* "The Sound of Music" (5+/5, Julie Andrews).

The film also won Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Music Adaptation and Best Sound, and received nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Costumes and Best Set Design.  Overall, I rate this film with 5 out of 5 stars.  Some people do not enjoy the film at all, but most people will be endeared to Maria, Captain von Trapp and the von Trapp children.  I highly recommend purchase of this DVD.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="an excellent film generously accented by eye popping effects and humor......"></head><body><p>This was my introduction to writer/director/producter/actor Stephen Chow and the genre of kung fu films.  I have to say that though a lot of the inspirations for this film are derived from inside jokes (mostly easily comprehendable to fans of the genre), they still succeeded in making me laugh (or at least smile), plus computer generated special effects and broad, self effacing humor and you will definitely see why "Kung Fu Hustle" stands out from the other films of its kind.<br /><br />Sing (Stephen Chow) is an aspiring--if clumsy--kung fun master who was told by a begger/con artist as a child that he was the chosen kung fu master and would unlock his potential if he purchased a special book for only $10 (his life savings).  Though, Sing hasn't been able to successfully execute a single kung fu move in all the years that followed that chance encounter, his one true wish it become a part of the very violent "Axe Gang" that terrorizes the---seemingly--humble residents of Pig Pen Alley in 1940s Hong Kong.  What Sing doesn't realize is that the residents have some martial arts moves of their own (particularly the landlady who has NEVER lost a yelling contest, the tailor, and virtually everyone down to the little boys).<br /><br />Honestly, I can't begin to articulate in this review just what style--visually--this film would fit into.  This, like other films of its kind, has plenty of action packed sequences, gravity defying fights and eye popping depictions of stylized violence (or should I say injury?  you literally see someone's teeth popping out of their head!).<br /><br />This is the biggest blockbuster in Hong Kong history, for good reason.  You will definitely be entertained.  A note:  This is not suitable for young children or young teens.  This is an R-rated film for good reason.  The title speaks for itself.....</p></body></html>

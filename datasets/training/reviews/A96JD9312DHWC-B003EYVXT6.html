For the two doctors we have here, that is growing a combination of spliced animals, mating them, and then seeing what happens. The results seem promising, too, and they even give the good dostors a reason to continue. when they ask to put in human materials into the splicing salad, they are told they cannot and that Phase 2, basically finding ways to make money with this new stuff, was the way to go. Otherwise, it was shutdown city. Being doctors and seeing things the way people in lab coats sometimes do, this does not keep them from growing something.<br />And that something, Dren, is a lot more than they bargained for.<br /><br />When I first watch this movie, I felt like I had missed some of the horror.this had a lot of layers in it that spoke on a woman wanting a child, on a man finding himself in a very odd place, and perhaps even the idea of what happens when we make something that is way out-of-bounds when it comes to science and breakthroughs. That said, it did not seem to be terrifying. It had some moments, sure, and it seemed really well done on the CGI front. Honestly, the things that were made before "it" and the "it" itself was beautiful. I just expeced something different.<br /><br />The second time I watched it I saw a different movie altogether. I knew that I didn't need the horror I was loking for in the front so I looked for other things. and the other things were, at least, really terrible. When you think about the idea of taking pieces of a person and putting them into something for observation, that can be odd. But when it turns out to have dominate human traits and looks and seems like a person, that is different. The want to terminate the thing becomes wanting to kill, and that is a lot harder. Other things work their way into the loop as well - this is the first time it had been done and, accordingly, there were a lot of things that were unexpected. The attraction it could bring, the wings it could have, the capacity to grow and continue growing; in so many ways that was terrible. And when it finds meat, you can just tell that this might take things a whole different wsay.<br /><br />If you like horrible things on a subtle front, then you might like this. The commercials are not what they shot out there so you chould forget them and forcus on good acting, good CGI, nice storytelling and some unexpected twists. Also, look at how the thing acts when it is growing. You can see a lot of the humanity we hide there, not to mention the things we float to the front. To me, that earned it right on a 4, saying I liked it and would like it again.<br />I think more people would, too, if they knew what to expect ahead of time.</p></body></html>

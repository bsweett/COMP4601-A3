<meta name="summary" content="Jigsaw has returned....."></head><body><p>Is this sequel a worthy successor to the original Saw? Well, it's a bit of a step down in the series for a couple of reasons. First, half of Jigsaw's victims are just plain annoying. You've got your typical dumb and whiny chicks, and your typical arrogant jerk. You even got a young teenager, who is probably the most annoying one out of all of them. And he doesn't even talk that much! Second, this film also has your standard detective plot thread. Jigsaw is typically found and interrogated (like you've never seen THAT before in the detective genre), and the detectives themselves look like obvious cardboard cutouts. The good news is those are the only flaws I can find in this film, I think. The traps are far more inventive than the ones in the original, and while they didn't freak me out, they are still disturbing to look at. We get to know a little more about Jigsaw and why he makes his victims play his little "games." He's probably one of the creepiest villains in the horror genre.<br /><br />If you loved the first Saw, then you would probably love this one as well if you don't mind the flaws. I enjoyed watching it myself, and it was enough for me to have interest in the next sequel.<br /><br />Grade: B-</p></body></html>

The cool part about George A. Romero's great classic is that it's poking fun at our society and were not actually going to turn into zombies.  Hostel Part II goes right for the jugular, or some other private area in the most brutal and realistic castration scene since Cannibal Holocaust.  The film asks the question could this really happen?  In the age of the internet where everything is available at our fingertips and perhaps what shocks you today you'll be far to desensitized to be effected by in time.  Basically Hostel II is a brutal horror film wrapped in that same message a classic like Dawn of the Dead had without using satire or subtly it reflects the ugly side of mankind where as the Wu Tang Clan said C.R.E.A.M (cash rules everything around me).<br />As I said the film is far superior to the original and takes off literally where the first one left off.  This time we have three female college students, who are led astray by another girl they meet and end up at a spa in Slovakia.  As soon as they arrive at the Hostel the online bidding begins all over the globe to see who gets each girl.  There are twists and turns and it is not your typical torture porn.  There is a plot, we have effective character development; meaning we actually like some of the girls and care if something happens, and there are actually no kills for the first forty minutes.  The villains in this movie look like me and you.  As they make there descent down the elevator to do their horrible deeds they act as if they are gladiators and it angers us because gladiators did battle in an arena and didn't kill someone that was tied up.<br />A lot of criticism for this film will come for the simple fact that it's a new movie and doesn't have the benefit of other films now considered classics that were probably hated upon in their initial release as well.<br />The mere hatred for the film reflects America's hypocrisies as well that people are so angry about entertainment yet if you turned on the news it's far worse then Hostel I or II combined; are the same people writing letters and participating in sit ins?<br />The dvd quality was great and rivaled some Hd dvds I've seen and the soundtrack was equally amazing I had to keep my receiver about 6-8 decibles lower than usual for the same effect.<br />I wasn't a big fan of Hostel I although I didn't hate it and if you read any of my lists to see my tastes I'm really not into the goriest horror.  A lot of my favorites include Jacques Tourneur's Night of the Demon, Something Wicked This Way Comes, Kwaidan, Nosferatu (1922), The Exorcist, Wolfen, The Shining, Misery, Don't Look Now, Night of The Hunter, Halloween, Fall of the House of Usher (epstein), To name serveral, to give you an idea of my likes.<br />I don't think we live in a dreadful society with no hope, however this is a horror film and does reflect mans ugly side and if you look at the news we do have an ugly side.  Hostel II is one of the best horror films in 2007 and deserves a watch.</p></body></html>

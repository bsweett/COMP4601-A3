<meta name="summary" content="Goofy satire of sci-fi genre is hysterically funny"></head><body><p>Galaxy Quest opened around Christmas 1999 against a lot of high profile movies. It never set any records, but it ran and ran and ran, eventually doing better than many of its competitors. It's easy to see why. It's mindless and daffy, yet also amiable and funny. It's the gentlest of satires. It does not aspire to greatness. It aspires to entertain, and that it does. <p>The title refers to a fictional TV show about space travel and conquest, and it seems suspiciously like Star Trek. The movie opens with the has- been cast of the show, which ended twenty years ago, at a convention of fans. Most of the actors are there for the money and not for the geeky, obsessed fans. The exception is Jason Nesmith [Tim Allen], who played Commander Peter Taggart. Nesmith tries hard not to ruin the fans' fantasies. One group actually tells him they are there to enlist the crew in saving their planet, and he atiently plays along. Later, in the men's room, Nesmith overhears two kids talking about how sad and stupid the cast and the fans are. Crushed, he flees the convention and goes home, where he promptly consumes a great deal of whiskey. The next morning finds him passed out on his living room floor. Outside the sliding glass door, the same weird group that wanted him to help them is knocking on the glass. In a fog, he lets them in. One thing leads to another, and he discovers that they really ARE aliens. They think that the TV show is real, a historical record of real events. Apparently these aliens have no imaginations, and when they recorded the show's TV signal, the idea that the information might be false never crossed their minds. Oh, how earthling advertisers would love this crowd!<p>It isn't long before Nesmith and the aliens have enlisted the rest of the stars - Lt. Tawny Madison [Sigourney Weaver], Dr. Lazurus [Alan Rickman], Tech. Sgt. Chen [Tony Shalhoub], and even an extra, Crew Member 6 [Sam Rockwell]. This group of very earthbound people suddenly finds itself in outer space aboard a craft that is based on their old TV show sets. What are they supposed to do? How can they work instruments that never really existed or combat monsters and aliens which are not actors in costumes? The answers they come up with help make this one of the funnier comedies in recent memory.<p>Allen and Weaver are perfectly cast, for who would be better in this parody than the fumbling star of Home Improvement and the heroine of the Aliens movies? What could be funnier than to have Alan Rickman basically reprise his role as Col. Brandon in Sense and Sensibility, only this time in space? What could be more clever than to include an extra, who spends the entire movie knowing he's going to die in the next ten minutes because that's what happened on the TV show? And the aliens? They are hysterical to watch. Theier actual body shapes resemble giant squids, but they have the ability to transform into human-looking beings. Only problem is that they can't quite get the body movements down right, not to mention the voices.<p>I think it must be hard to make a movie that's just plain fun, but Galaxy Quest succeeds nearly all the time. Frankly, I was never much of a Star Trek or a Star Wars fan. I appreciated their appeal but never got caught up in the fantasies. I enjoyed this movie immensely, even though most of the in jokes were lost on me. I can only imagine how appealing it must be to people who are more informed about the things it parodies than I am.</p></body></html>

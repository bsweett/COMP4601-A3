There was some mildly funny humor here and there, but over all the movie was atrocious!!<br /><br />Take three estranged & dysfunctional brothers that don't trust each other. Then place them together on a 1st class train compartment to travel across India in search of "Enlightenment". All the while each one of them goes about undermining each others trust for most of the movie. Sounds like they each have a lot of unresolved issues/baggage and an odd upbringing to boot.<br /><br />Somehow or another through finally meeting up with their mother, who is a nun in India, and has abandoned them all every opportunity she can find to do so and over coming their father's death, do the finally find peace in an odd sort of way or so it seems. The movie doesn't make it clear.</p></body></html>

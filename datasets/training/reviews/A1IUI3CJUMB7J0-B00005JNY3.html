<meta name="summary" content="A good suspensfull spooky film with a either love it or hate it twist at the end"></head><body><p>After the horriable Ring Two we needed a good thriller and here comes a good one. The film was a flop at the box office but I think will do good in video. The film has a good story about a women who nurses an ild man in a old southern house that holds deadly seacrets. the movie is not scary and has no jump moments but it's just suspsnfull and spooky. The film has good acting and direction. The downfall is the twist I did not know if it was good or bad and mad me think( I think people will either hate ot love the ending). Overall it was a good spooky suspensfull film.</p></body></html>

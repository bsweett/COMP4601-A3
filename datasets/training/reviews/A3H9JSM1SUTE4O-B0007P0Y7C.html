<meta name="summary" content="BETTER THAN THE THEATRICAL VERSION"></head><body><p>When theatrical releases fail to find an audience, and the first DVD editions don't catch fire, one rule of thumb is to bring out a "special edition." Even better, call it a "director's cut" and then add the magic word "unrated." In the case of ELEKTRA Unrated Director's Cut, the tweaked new version is actually more entertaining than previous incarnations. It's tighter (four minutes shorter), there's new action, effects, flashbacks, sound mix and commentary.<br /><br />The second disc includes a two hour and 20 minute, two part making-of feature, deleted, alternate/extended scenes, new opening, storyboards and more.</p></body></html>

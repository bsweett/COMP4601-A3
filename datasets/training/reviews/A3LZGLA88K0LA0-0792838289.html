<meta name="summary" content="MURDER SHE WROTE MEETS MOMMIE DEAREST"></head><body><p>After all these years and in spite of a very well done remake, THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE of 1962 stands as one of the finest examples of moviemaking in our history.  Director John Frankenheimer and screenwriter George Axelrod brilliantly captured Richard Condon's novel and there are some truly brilliant scenes.<br /><br />*The scene interspersing the ladies club with the communist, Russian and Chinese military men is awesome.  Its calculating manner in which Raymond Shaw is forced to kill two of his comrades is chilling.<br /><br />*When Shaw is playing solitaire in the bar and the bartender mentions "Go jump in the lake", it's repercussions are marvelously chilling.<br /><br />*When Mrs. Shaw informs Raymond of his final task, her evil and chilling portrayal comes to full fruition when she kisses him on the mouth.<br /><br />Angela Lansbury gives one of the best supporting performances on film.  She is brutally manipulative, coldly perverse and demonic.  Losing the Oscar to Patty Duke is understandable in some ways, but Lansbury's performance is just as good in my book.  Laurence Harvey, long panned by critics for his "emotionless" performances is perfect as Raymond Shaw.  Whether his emotionless was intended or not, Harvey still manages to make Shaw a pathetically sympathetic character, who does show his range in his "Gaucho marx" joke and in his love for Leslie Parrish (remember her from Li'l Abner?).  This was his finest moment on screen.<br /><br />Frank Sinatra does an okay job, but his performance is overshadowed by his supporting players.  Janet Leigh is lovely, but her role is so underdeveloped, she could have been left out.  Khigh Diegh (later to be Wofat on Hawaii 5-0) is coldly evil in his brief, but impressive, role.  And good old John McGiver was marvelous as Senator Jordan, a man of conviction.<br /><br />THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a spell binding and still powerful movie.  The people who did the remake were wise to alter some of its plot lines to avoid comparison.  It's rare that both movies are so good but this one has the creative edge.</p></body></html>

The Happening does have an excellent premise which if given to a director like Frank Darabont could have easily been an excellent psychological thriller like last year's overlooked The Mist. Mark Wahlberg who happens to be one of my favorite actors provides one of his worst performances since The Truth About Charlie. Wahlberg displays no chemistry with Zooey Deshunal and watching the movie it's as if all the actors were method acting. There are two redeeming things about The Happening though; the first is the short running and the second is a scene involving a lawn mower. I wont's give any details about the scene other than it's one of the funniest on screen deaths of the year. Wahlberg will have a chance to redeem himself later this year with the video game adaptation Max Payne; as for Shamilan unless his makes a mini series about New Edition it'll be hard for me to ever support any of his movies again.</p></body></html>

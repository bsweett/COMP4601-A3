<meta name="summary" content="Formula but very entertaining"></head><body><p>V is a skillful blending of the revenge picture ("They tortured him and left him for dead...now he's back and he'll make 'em pay!") and the bleak future world picture ("In the near future we will all have numbers. The government will tell us what to think.  But a rag-tag group of renegades will risk everything...to save mankind.")<br /><br />That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie!  Very polished.  Great soundtrack.  But for people to say its thought provoking, suggesting it had not occurred to them that right wing politicians are ruining the quality of our lives, well, duh.<br /><br />To be honest I thought there were some sincere aspirations until the end.  But once the point was made, and the masses were on the march there really was no need to blow anything else up.  But come on, this is pure entertainment disguised as something very serious.  Just enjoy--oh, and by the way, your National Identity card is in the mail.</p></body></html>

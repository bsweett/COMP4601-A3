<meta name="summary" content="Steven Spielberg tackles a tough subject brilliantly."></head><body><p>For those of you who don't know, Munich is the story of the covert group assigned to hunt down and kill the terrorists that murdered the 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972.  This is a brilliant movie.  In my opinion, the best of 2005.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg tackles this tough subject ever so perfectly.  It's quite a wonderful movie to watch as well.  It's so refreshing to see cinema being used as a way to teach more than just one to entertain.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to everyone.  It's a definite must see, one that will give you a new perspective on life.<br /><br />The DVD itself features an introduction by Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />Must See.</p></body></html>

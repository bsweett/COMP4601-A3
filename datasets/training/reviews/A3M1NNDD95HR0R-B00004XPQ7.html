<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Movie"></head><body><p>This movie is a great one, and you will like it even more if you are interested in the historic time period in which it takes place.<br /><br />Mel Gibson plays a pacifist who, after doing his best to avoid violence, has it thrust upon him by a heartless officer.  After one of his boys gets murdered right in front of his eyes, IT'S ON!!!  While I am not big on revenge, this movie urges that justice be done.  You find yourself rooting for Mel Gibson every step of the way after that.  This is easily one of the best period pieces ever made.</p></body></html>

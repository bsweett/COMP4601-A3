<meta name="summary" content="Weakest of the Series"></head><body><p>"SAW III" or the entire "SAW" franchise for that matter has already been known as one of the goriest horror/suspense series (except, probably "Hostel" and some of Miike's films), so I expected what I would see from the beginning. Frankly I didn't care the amount of blood or violence, but when the story seems to be repeating itself, there must be a problem. Actually some part of "SAW III" is only repeating what we already know in the previous two films (though it is told from a different perspective with flashbacks).<br /><br />But what is most disappointing for me is that in "SAW III" the intriguing relations between Jigsaw and one character (you know who) are not fully developed. The filmmakers, it seems, spent most of energy to set up various methods of tortures, which is fine, I admit, but they could have created something more interesting out of the master-pupil-like relations between them with more subdued approach and less swearing.<br /><br />I also find the film shows its hand too early. During the film's story, we only wait for the next "challenge" to start and the results are now fairly predictable. (Remember the first "SAW" of which script showed some intelligence even in the gory trap scenes). And if Jigsaw is terminally ill, how did he manage to set up such elaborated torture machines?<br /><br />The only scene I was interested is the brief moment where Jigsaw's past is suggested. After all it is him and his eccentric personality that has made "SAW" a cut above other slasher films. Let's see what happens next in the forthcoming fourth installment because considering how "SAW III" wraps up, to continue the plot after that would be the hardest part of the entire series.</p></body></html>

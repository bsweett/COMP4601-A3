Unfortunately, "Superman Returns" falls short of this IMO. I've seen it 3 times and just can't help feeling that there was wasted potential with virtually every aspect of it, but of course, mainly with the story.<br /><br />I'll echo what many other reviewers have pointed out about the plot-it just feels hollow, contrived and disjointed. I could never get attached to any of the characters enough to really care about what happened to them. I don't blame the actors, I blame the script. There are some scenes that just flat-out bothered me, for example, the lack of true terror on behalf of the airplane passengers after Superman saves them and goes inside the plane to check on them. They just plummeted from the sky in an aircraft and they're only a little shaken up? Come on. Instead of looking like real-life people horrified at having narrowly escaped death, they look like a bunch of actors doing an awful job of pretending to be horrified at having narrowly escaped death, at the command of Bryan Singer. It's poorly executed scenes like this that cause the audience to become ambivalent to what's going on. And why couldn't Superman's son have played a bigger part or have more done with his character? Why was he even in this movie?<br /><br />In terms of performances, I actually think Brandon Routh does a fine job as Clark Kent/Superman. I had no issues with him in the title role, even if he's a little young. Nobody could have filled Christopher Reeve's shoes, so Routh shouldn't be expected to either. To me Kevin Spacey was merely adequate as Lex Luthor. The only issue I have is with Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. Sorry, just can't buy her in that role. I could easily picture Courtney Cox as Lois...she does have some resemblance to Margot Kidder, and would be a more appropriate age for that role.<br /><br />But on to the good points. The special effects are excellent, even if the CGI isn't realistic-looking in some scenes. The main action sequences are highly entertaining, certainly a lot more thrilling than the previous "Superman" films, using the modern-day technology. And just the overall look of the film is impressive. So yeah, I suppose I'm saying that this movie's strongest point is with its visuals.<br /><br />If this were just another summer blockbuster movie I'd probably give it a better review, but this is Superman we're talking about. It could have (and SHOULD have) been a superbly-made spectacle that pays homage to the originals. Instead, it's "just another action flick." So for that it gets a 3 from me. I got my money's worth, but failed to walk out of the theater with a revived admiration for the legacy of Superman.<br /><br />And for those of you who own the DVD, here's how to access the Easter Egg on the second disc. Go to Special Features, then go to Deleted Scenes. Put the cursor on "Features" at the bottom of the screen and press Down once. A red Superman logo will appear directly underneath "Features" and "Menu." Place the cursor on the logo and press Enter to see some outtakes of Kevin Spacey doing his "Wrong!" scene.</p></body></html>

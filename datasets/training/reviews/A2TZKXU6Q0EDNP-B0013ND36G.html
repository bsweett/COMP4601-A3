<meta name="summary" content="The Parodator: a flaming disaster....."></head><body><p>With the 3rd part of the series now installed, The Terminator goes the full circle: from groundbreaking (T1) to braindead (T3).<br />  The only question that lingers painfully on after watching this disastrouly bad film is whether it's actually a parody of the previous 2 parts. If it is, then it fails at that too because funny it isn't either.<br />  But, if this is supposed to be taking itself seriously (and i'm afraid it does) then it fails even worse because there's absolutely nothing serious about it oncesoever:<br />  -a childish and sorry excuse for a script that never takes off, goes (inevitably) nowhere and finishes in noman's land..<br />  -acting for which you'd have to conduct some serious search to find it in as bad quality as it's found here<br />  -a braindead explosion-festival that looks like a sony-station game with little ambition, where the good wipe off the bad and vice versa leaving the audience with a functioning brain in total apathy..<p>  This is really a pity considering that T1 which kicked this series of films off was cutting-edge on many levels and T2 did follow up in a respectable manner. This one though is obviously just a cheap vehicle for making money. There is no &quot;edge&quot; here, as all the explosion fair has been seen before countless times, there's no extension of the plot from the previous &quot;Terminators&quot;, there's frankly nothing.<br />  There are some things though that are in fact impressive, indeed far more impressive than the &quot;effects&quot; which are actually a bad repetition of those in T2: that would be the fact that &quot;Arnie&quot; seems to speak worse and more unintelligible english the longer he's in America. I cant begin to imagine how that could be possible but several times through this &quot;film&quot; i caught myself thinking &quot;what was that, what did he say???&quot;<br /><br />It hardly matters of course as there's barely anything of remote importance being uttered in this joke of a film but i'm still wondering.<p>  As for the rest of the cast, I've seen real B-movies with far better acting than this. I'm saying B-movies, cuzz this is what T3 really is. A b-flick destined for the video-club sematary at best, allthough you'b wasting your money even if you simply rented this. As well as your time.<br />  Hopefully he won't &quot;be back&quot;.</p></body></html>

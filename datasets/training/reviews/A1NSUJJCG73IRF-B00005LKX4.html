<meta name="summary" content="Hannibal  (2001)"></head><body><p>Director:  Ridley Scott<br /><br />Cast:  Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Giancarlo Giannini, Gary Oldman, Ray Liotta, Frankie Faison, Francesca Neri, Zeljko Ivanek, Hazelle Goodman.<br /><br />Running Time:  131 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for strong gruesome violence, some nudity and language.<br /><br />When "Hannibal" was in the process of being made, it seemed like it was going to be a thrilling exciting follow up to the Oscar-winning, highly acclaimed "The Silence of the Lambs".  Hopkins was back as Lector, Ray Liotta was to play the obnoxious Paul Krendler, Gary Oldman was the severely distorted and disabled Mason Verger and the film was being directed by the recent Oscar-winning director Ridley Scott (for "Gladiator"). Although Foster turned down the role of Clarice again, it went to Julianne Moore which seemed an astute move by the film crew.  Unfortunately, "Hannibal" turns into a campy shockfest more concerned with orchestrating gory death scenes than actually creating a tense, atmospheric adaptation of Thomas Harris's critically supportive third installment of the Hannibal Lecter novel series.<br /><br />Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) is now famous for her work with Hannibal "the Cannibal" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), the notorious killer who has since escaped to Venice. After a bloody drug bust resulted in a mother being shot while holding her child, Starling is tormented by her co-workers and various other people. Meanwhile, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) is hunting down Lecter in hopes for revenge. Verger is the only victim to have encountered Hannibal and survive, but he's horribly disfigured from the experience and has become obsessed with Lecter. While all of this is happening, Lecter is living the good life in Venice, becoming a very respectable yet creepy fellow. Things become complicated though when Inspector Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) finds out who he really is. Verger tells Starling that he may know where the great cannibal is and this sets things into motion. Now with co-worker Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta) breathing down her neck, Clarice revisits her experiences with Hannibal and starts to contact Pazzi. Unknown to her, Verger has paid Pazzi a hefty sum of money in order to catch Lecter alive. After the failed attempt resulted in a gory manner, Lecter comes back to America to visit Clarice and break the silence.  Julianne Moore made little impression with her portrayal of Starling though that`s through little fault of her own because it`s always the most difficult job of an actor playing a role made famous by someone else , and Starling is sidelined in much of the film . As for the other actors, Hopkins is competent but by no means spell binding , Liota gives the impression that a robot played his role throughout the film, Giancarlo Giannini is good, but Gary Oldman absolutely steals the show as Mason Verger playing the role just the right side of camp complete with some great make-up .<br /><br />As for the other aspects of "Hannibal", Ridley Scott directs with an almost operatic touch.  You really do get the feeling watching this that Scott`s ambition in life is to do a remake of "Amadeus" with Hopkins in the role of Atonio Salieri; however, the one major flaw with "Hannibal" is the script by Mamet and Zaillian, only moderately staying true to the book and deviating from the original components that made "Silence of the Lambs" so efficient and engrossing, especially with the ending which is riducously over the top .  Despite Scott's ability to make a visually stunning and intriguing film, we are still left with a lack of narrative thrust, so that while individual scenes, particularly those depicting Lecter at large in a gothically-rendered Florence of shadows and fog, have a certain fascination, they don't really join up to make a satisfying whole. Besides which, Anthony Hopkins does not seem to have re-discovered the inimitable creepiness as Lecter that he nailed in "Lambs". It seems that uncaged, Lecter lacks the coiled menace of his earlier incarnation, and Hopkins seems to have merely turned up to collect his paycheck this time round. Possibly the biggest problem with "Hannibal", however, is the absence of Jodie Foster. Into her shoes steps Julianne Moore, a fine actress in her own right, but a calm, almost ethereal presence where Foster was pugnacious, edgy and brittle. Foster defined the role, and Moore has a thankless task made all the more difficult by a script that gives her little to do but react to the machinations of the corrupt men that surround her.  A major letdown from a big-time director and a usually solid group of cast members.</p></body></html>

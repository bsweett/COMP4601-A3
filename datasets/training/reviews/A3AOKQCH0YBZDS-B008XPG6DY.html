Just Very Average!"></head><body><p>I think the title of my review sums up "Derailed" quite nicely.<br /><br />The 1st 30 minutes of this movie starts off very slowly. So slow in fact that my husband & I were contemplating stopping this DVD 25 minutes into "Derailed" because it was so boring!<br /><br />However, we did finish this movie and were glad that we did as the storyline does pick after the 1st 30 minutes. There were a lot of twists and turns in this movie and some suspense, however most of the major plot details were predictable! I won't bore you with the plot details as you can read what others have mentioned about the plot in their reviews.<br /><br />The acting in this movie was mediocre. Clive Owen's character in this movie was the most frustrating character in this movie. I had a difficult time believing some of the choices his character made in this movie!</p></body></html>

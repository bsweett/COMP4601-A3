<meta name="summary" content="Star Trek IV: The Road Trip From Hell"></head><body><p>Who would have thought that getting home from a planet lightyears away would be such a hassle? Following only months on the heels of Star Trek III, this movie starts with our beloved crew on Vulcan with a Klingon cruiser. However, before they can get home, they decide to take a quick detour to the late 20th century to, quite literally, save the whales.<br /><br />Hokey oversimplification of the plot aside, this is actually a very solid entry to the pantheon of Trekdom. While there are some who take issue with the overtness of the ecological message (Trek is usually better at hiding its agendas) there is plenty here for everyone to enjoy. In fact, when it came out in Europe, it was billed as "The Voyage Home - Star Trek IV", not even playing up the fact that it is a star trek movie at all. In the end it became one of the most commercially successful of all Star Trek movies (as of this writing).<br /><br />Granted, commercial success does not prove greatness. (I would point out that the first Star Trek movie was a financial success.) In this case however, it is a good indication. In the best Star Trek tradition, there is drama, there is humor, there is action and (of course) there are aliens about to literally destroy the earth until Kirk and crew intervene and send them packing.<br /><br />Great fun and a wonderful DVD.</p></body></html>

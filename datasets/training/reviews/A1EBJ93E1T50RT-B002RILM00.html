The ending chilled me for weeks -- even though I knew all of the big spoilers beforehand -- and I'll still occasionally have "Wicker Man" nightmares.<br /><br />If I'd never seen the first film, and if I went into the remake cold -- as did most of the sparse crowd of theatergoers I saw this with -- would I have had those same feelings about this movie?  Would I still have nightmares years later?  The answer is "no".<br /><br />I'm not certain that Neil LaBute's gender politics are the reason this movie did not light any fires within me (pardon the pun, that was the best I could do).  If anything else, I knew this movie wasn't going to have a happy ending, and let's face it, the original movie's ending is what made it stand out.<br /><br />Maybe it was Nicolas Cage doing his usual shtick that soured me.  Sergeant Howie, the protagonist of the original, is a very dated figure to today's American audience, but he does command his own movie.  His quest became our quest, his horror became our horror.  Cage's "Officer Ed" (a nice homage to the original star) remains distant from the audience throughout: when the ending comes, his pleas for relief are unconvincing, his distress shown from too far off to be affecting.  The situation he finds himself in is horrible, but LaBute doesn't get the horror across.<br /><br />The goings-on on Summer's Isle are murky.  This is a Celtic witches' community, after 400 years of evolution away from the Old Country (Salem is mentioned, as if we didn't get the joke).  A local doctor (of the witch variety) refers to the "old ways", but LaBute leaves it to the audience to figure out what those ways were.  Bees are worshipped, their colony setup emulated.  The few men on Summer's Isle seem mute and emasculated, although again it's left to the audience to decipher their exact role.  A few moments of shock-horror -- a corpse's mouth sewn shut, a naked woman surrounded by thousands of bees -- don't linger after the credits roll.  The epilogue unites three sexy Young Hollywood actors, although this adds nothing to the movie that the final Cage vs. Ellen Burstyn sequence didn't tell on its own.  Even then, all the layers and complexities of Woodward's and Lee's final debate in the original movie don't survive into the virtual word-for-word rewrite here.<br /><br />In the end, it's impossible to rate this movie without comparison to the original.  On that basis alone, rent the original, and don't pay full theater price to see this version.</p></body></html>

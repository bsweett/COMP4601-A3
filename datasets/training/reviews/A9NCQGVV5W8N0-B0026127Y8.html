It's also about three different films in one, as it starts off in the vein of paranoiac American "Europe is a hotbed of evil and degradation" thrillers like Roman Polanski's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305133476">Frantic</a> and Eli Roth's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHRVP6">Hostel (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>, then becomes a gritty examination of sex trafficking in Paris, before entering decidedly Bondesque territory for a denouement which sees the protagonist cutting a swathe of destruction through an embassy party wearing a dinner jacket. What raises it above the level of your standard brainless action fare is Liam Neeson's turn as a character who is absolutely relentless, completely unapologetic and refreshingly lacking in political correctness in the way that he goes about tracking down and eradicating the Albanian gangster clich&eacute;s that have abducted his daughter. I actually turned to the other half towards the end and informed her that early nineties dancemeisters, 'Pop Will Eat Itself' had written the soundtrack for this film in the form of a song entitled "Get The Girl And Kill The Bad Guy". I loved it because it's exactly the kind of nasty, brutal, unreconstructed, fascistic, old-school revenge fantasy that Hollywood has been promising us for years, but has been too frightened too actually deliver - the awful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y7U97I">Death Sentence (Unrated Edition)</a> being the most recent catastrophic misfire which comes to mind. By its very nature, the revenge thriller is not a politically correct genre and it's a mistake to try and make it one. 'Taken' is nasty, it's violent, it's actually quite racist when you think about it, and it's also completely enjoyable. Complete tosh, but tosh done correctly for once, and as someone who has grown increasingly sick of seeing action movies watered down for a PG-13 audiences, I say god bless every uncompromising, bone-snapping R-rated minute of it.</p></body></html>

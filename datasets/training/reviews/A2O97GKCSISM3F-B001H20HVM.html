Seeing someone learning to help him with his work was a nice one too. Other than that I don't have much else to say about this one, mostly good things if I did though.<br /><br />August 8, 2010) I recently watched/purchased the two disc special edition-I wish they would've stuck with the clear case/dust cover with these first two films of the 2-disc. The storyline is pretty good-Donnie Wahlberg is a cop and father to a son who no longer understand each other. But when his son is thrust into a Jigsaw game-he is forced to change his tone. In the process he meets Jigsaw/Tobin Bell-you get a glimpse of his past and how he became so demented-the further chapters elaborate on this perfectly as well.<br />The 2-disc is better than the one disc because of the special features-making of featurettes, commentaries, and a few other odds and ends. The first trap in this one made me cringe-what the subject had to do was freaky. The twist at the end was wild just like the first SAW. Which edition do I recommend? Personally, if you like the Saw series like I do, you'll want to get both the clear case and 2-disc of both the first two films, at least. The uncut edition didn't change much here either, except a couple very subtle, and I do mean subtle changes when the swat team infiltrates Jigsaw's lair, that scene was slightly changed, other than that, I didn't see much different.<br />If I could grade this film, I'd give it an A-</p></body></html>

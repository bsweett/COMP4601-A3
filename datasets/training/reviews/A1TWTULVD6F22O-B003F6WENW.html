<meta name="summary" content="A little crude, a lot funny."></head><body><p>There's more than a little irony in the fact that John and Jeremy (Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn) are divorce mediators, who have, for years, crashed wedding after wedding during the "season" and had a blast.  Their aim is to attract and bed women who are, no doubt, easier game for two truly "sensitive" guys during a typical wedding hijinks.<br /><br />They've inherited their moves from an old friend of Jeremy's who turns up in a brilliant comic bit at the movie's end...Will Ferrell.  This might be the only REAL highlight at the end of the movie, because "Wedding Crashers" is giddy, funny, and full of chemistry right through the Cleary wedding (a big, big Washington political shindig)....but after the boys follow the Cleary's home, lusting after two of the sisters, it evolves into some nonsensical scenarios.<br /><br />Vaughn is great, Wilson less so, but they'll appear together again, because they're a great comedic pair.  Most of the supporting cast was eye-popping and funny, although Bradley Cooper as "Sack", John's rival for the screen-illuminating Rachel McAdams (from "The Notebook")is way  over the top, and Jane Seymour is wasted in her role.  Nevertheless, the comedy winds down into the valley of the "still funny" as the heroes begin to see the error of their ways and start to settle down.<br /><br />Lewd language and scenes abound, and thus the "R" rating.  Please don't take a child or a preteen, but go in yourself, expecting not much, and I guarantee you'll leave entertained.  Shaking your head, perhaps, but still entertained.<br /><br />3.5 stars....5 for Vince Vaughn!</p></body></html>

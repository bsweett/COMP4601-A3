In fact, it is quite good...in spots.<br /><br />The film drags a bit.  The story line moves back and forth in time, alternating between Alexander as king and conqueror and as son/heir apparent to Phillip.  Some like that device.  I, personally, feel that it is overused, somewhat cliche.<br /><br />The characters are well developed.  Colin Ferrell and the rest of the cast did admirable work.  The battle scenes are enjoyable but sometimes confusing (particularly the battle at Guagamela) and few and far between.<br /><br />Post Braveheart, movies about "great" men tend to deify them, tend to thrust upon the virtues or values of our civilization.  It was a bit hard to swallow that Alexander wanted conquer the then known world, not for riches, the spoils of war or the glory of conquest, but to free slaves and spread Greek civilization to the "heathens."  This much is suggested by Alexander in the film, a position that seems to starkly contrast berating of his generals for viewing Asians as an inferior civilization/people.<br /><br />There is a lot of information packed in the story.  One of the side benefits of a film like this is that it causes history lovers (like me) to learn the "true" story about Alexander, his family, his enemies, etc.<br /><br />Much is made about the bi-sexuality exhibited.  Anyone that has even a cursory knowledge of ancient history knows or has heard that Greek men were lovers of other men and kept women as wives and mothers.  I certainly don't proclaim to be an expert on the subject, but it seemed that the "men" or "boys" to which Alexander and his generals were attracted were extremely effeminate, almost drag queens.  I understand that Greek men loved men precisely because they were men, not because they looked like flat-chested women.  It is a rather minor point, but since the sexual themes in the film seem never to be ignored, it is worth discussion.<br /><br />Overall, it is a good film.  It's by no means great.  I wouldn't purchase Alexander, but it's worth a rental.</p></body></html>

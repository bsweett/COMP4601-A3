The super fast zombies add a degree of suspense, these zombies could be Olympic runners. When I rented this movie I didn't pay attention to the rating or unrating.. However I thought while I was viewing it, it seemed beyond your average rated R movie. Come to find out it was this unrated director's cut. I'm only bringing this up because I've seen other movies that claim to be unrated or the director's cut and they don't seem like anything more than the R version. That's not the case here. I am a huge fan of zombie movies and horror movies period. This is one of the best horror movies in a while. The zombie FX are superb. The infant zombie was a little over the top, that whole scene was disturbing. I'm not sure how much of it made it in the R rated version but this version isn't for the faint @ heart. The original Dawn of the Dead (1979) is still very very good. If you haven't seen it I fully recommend it as well as this super cool remake.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Minority Rapport"></head><body><p>Incredible visuals.  Stunning special effects.  Edge-of-your-seat thrills and spills.<p>Yep:  Steven Spielberg, all right.<p>Yet MINORITY REPORT is more glitter than it is gold.  It is an uneven, inconsistent, often incoherent film, set in a future so imposing and Orwellian I'm darn glad I'll never live to see it.  And what on earth was with mainframe computers being controlled by dramatic hand gestures?  The future looks solid for all you budding musical conductors out there.<p>The premise of the film on its face is illegal and unethical:  arrest someone before he or she commits a crime--a crime as foretold by three troubled clairvoyants floating in water.  At least I appreciated the discourse--however brief--between the advocates of Washington, D.C.'s "Precrime Division" and a concerned FBI investigator (Colin Farrell) regarding the feasibility of metaphysical crime prevention.  It was interesting stuff, then promptly discarded for the next chase scene.<p>Tom Cruise, as usual, is solid as Precrime Detective John Anderton, an enthusiastic proponent of hauling people away before they commit murder until he himself is the target of a relentless manhunt by his former colleagues.  Max von Sydow as Precrime Director Lamar Burgess looks exactly like the aging priest he played in "The Exorcist" thirty years ago (that was all I could think about as I watched him).  Sure, there's plenty of heart-pounding action, and Spielberg also throws in a few gross video wedgies to make us recoil uncomfortably, yet MINORITY REPORT falls short of effective storytelling, and even dissolves into a contrived, constipated ending.<br />--D.

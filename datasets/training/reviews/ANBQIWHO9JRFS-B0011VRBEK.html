<meta name="summary" content="Best film of 2005"></head><body><p>Well, that title is perhaps a cheat, as I believe it was actually released in most of the world in 2004 and South Korea in 2003, but I've noticed that some real critics like to go by the year the film came out in their country, so I'll let it slide.<br /><br />Though 'Oldboy' certainly isn't popular, it has gotten quite a lot of underground buzz, and it seems like it always gets compared to the work of some better known director, either Fincher or Nolan or Tarantino or Miike or whoever.  Comparisons can be useful, but they tend to suggest that the film or director is clone or knockoff, and thinking this would be a grave disservice to Chan-wook Park and 'Oldboy'.  This is a strikingly modern film, slick and beautiful in its hyper-technological, urban setting, with an occasionally fractured narrative filled with both dark humor and gruesome violence .  So the comparisons are fairly accurate, actually,  but Park has a knack for putting it all together that it's clear that he isn't imitating anyone else.  It all holds together underneath, with strong storytelling and genuine human interest beneath the attractive surface.<br /><br />You've probably already heard to premise: A drunken and surly, but still seemingly good-natured man named Dae-su spends a night at the police station just before he is abducted by a mysterious stranger.  He's placed in a small apartment devoid of any human contact for 15 years, until he is suddenly released one day.  Dae-su wants revenge, but he perhaps even more than that, he wants to know why this happened to him.  During this he meets a young lady, Mi-do and quickly finds the man responsible for his imprisonment, Woo-jin.  Woo-jin makes a sort of deal with him: If, in the next 5 days, Dae-su can find out why all this happened, Woo-jin will kill himself.  If not, he will kill Mi-do, along with every other woman that Dae-su ever loves.  This may make the film sound rather plot-intensive, but it actually isn't.  Dae-su actually solves the bulk of the mystery fairly easily, the plot generally moves quickly in leaps and bounds between the moody, surreal scenes and various setpieces.<br /><br />`Oldboy' is perhaps the best looking film of last year.  Park composes his shots with great care and it's all sleek, fashionable and modern.  And though it isn't an action movie is still has some cool fighting.  There is one very rough, extended single-shot fight that is becoming quite famous, and rightfully so.  The use of music is also fantastic, with various repeating themes manipulating the mood nicely.  You need great music in order to build up a sorta operatic grandiosity and intensity which this film has in its best scenes.<br /><br />The performances are all great, particularly Min-sik Choi and Ji-tae Yu as Dae-su and Woo-jin, respectively.  Most notably, though they are hero and villain, both of these characters prove to be exceedingly likable and sympathetic once you find out all there is to know.  Dae-su is definitely one of the best protagonists in recent film history, combining an undeniable bada**ness with inner turmoil and self-doubt.  Woo-jin is interesting in that he is rather non-threatening looking and has a fairly playful demeanor that he rarely drops.<br /><br />There are plenty of movies out there that I really like simply because they have so many neat ideas and look so good.  `Oldboy' works on this level, but it also has some real human interest and emotional impact that most films are lacking.  You can really feel the pain of being locked away for so long with no contact, and the scene where Dae-su and Mi-do say goodbye before he heads of to confront Woo-jin is really quite powerful, as are a number of things which happen during the climax of the film, though I can't go into specifics.<br /><br /> I've heard some complain that the ending is slightly drawn-out, and while this is something of a problem it's pretty much the only real concern I have with the film, and it barely matters.  I must note that the denouement will likely put some people off, and not without good reason, as it is rather strange and perverse.  I was sufficiently into the film that I went with it despite the disturbing implications, but others doubtless will not. (Judging by the critical response, however, I believe that most people will go along with it.)  Also, the film does have a significant twist in it, but it's not totally the heart of the film. Well, I should say, it's crucial to the plot, but the whole point of the movie isn't simply to have the rug pulled out from underneath you at the end.  I'm interested to see how they'll deal with this twist in the American remake, as I'm sure execs will assume that such a twist will be upsetting to many viewers, but if you change it you pretty much have to come up with a whole new plot.<br /><br />I guess I'm tired of writing.  Check it out, and whatever you do, DON'T WATCH THE DUBBED VERSION!!!!!! I repeat, DON'T WATCH THE DUBBED VERSION!!!!!!!<br /><br />Grade: A</p></body></html>

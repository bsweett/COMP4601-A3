This comedy sendup of the 1970's TV series has a plot as flimsy as Cameron Diaz's outfits, but who cares!  It gives us inane comedy interwoven with serious action, making it wonderfully mindless entertainment.<p>From a technical standpoint, the film is first rate.  First time feature director Joseph McGinty Mitchell (McG) who has won numerous awards for music and commercial videos seems unfazed by this gargantuan project ($92 million budget).  Though the film is done in a hodgepodge of styles (a hallmark of video directors), each is extremely well done, using locations, color and sets imaginatively and effectively.  The pace, like McG himself, is like a frenetic roller coaster ride and the humor generally works.<p>Probably the most impressive elements of the film are the fighting scenes.  Diaz, Barrymore and Liu all trained tirelessly on the wire to produce fabulously athletic fighting scenes that look authentic.  The editing of these scenes is outstanding and when you see them, it seems that Cameron Diaz really can jump eight feet in the air, travel ten yards and kick her foe in the face three times!  There is an excellent behind-the-scenes feature on the DVD that shows how this was done.  This is only one of the many special features on this loaded DVD.  In addition, the DTS sound on the DVD is outstanding and explosive.<p>The acting; well there is not a lot of serious acting going on here.  It is all very tongue in cheek and all three angels handle their roles with an excellent combination of sarcastic humor and sexiness.  Bill Murray is great as the twenty-first century Bosley.  Kelly Lynch is also delectably evil as Vivian rendering some good fight scenes herself.<p>This film is a real crowd pleaser.  I rated it an 8/10.  It has terrific production values, great action, amusing humor and a killer cast.  With all this, who needs a story?</p></body></html>

Heinlein's 'Starship Troopers' later, and the book is SO much better than the movie! The book discusses a lot of philosophy - child-rearing, patriotism, military attitudes, citizenship, war, etc. It really is an awesome book, and I highly recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />The movie is lacking in the genius of the book. Bit of trivia - while in the movie Dizzy was a girl, in the book, Dizzy was actually a man, a minor character who died fairly early on in the book. The film is more about adventure and special effects, the story itself doesn't have much substance. Seriously, read the book.</p></body></html>

If you appreciate a movie whose complex twists and plot turns and counter-turns puzzle you and make you think, "Eyes Wide Shut" is a masterpiece.  Stanley Kubrick was never an easy director to understand and his last movie is a powerful, intriguing enigma.  I'm not a fan of either Tom Cruise or Nicole Kidman, but I thought they were both excellent in this film.  Cruise plays a doctor with a comfortable lifestyle (beautiful wife, cute daughter, plush digs on Central Park West), who is devastated by his wife's mock confession of a fantasized infidelity, which sends him out into a night journey in which fantasy and reality become so intertwined that we can't see where one stops and the other starts.  How much do we really see?  Do we sometimes go deliberately blind in order not to see?  Kubrick explores all this and more in this exquisite film, and when the couple wake up to the cold light of day, they are left to realize that fantasy, however distasteful, needn't destroy everything that reality has built up.  A lot of people hate this movie simply because they can't understand it, and it moves at the pace of an arthritic snail; but as previously stated, this is not an action film; you need to slow down and think and reflect as you watch it.  If you have sufficient maturity for this, then this movie is indeed for you.</p></body></html>

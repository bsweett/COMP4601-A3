<meta name="summary" content="Welcome back, Kevin."></head><body><p>Kevin Costner does not strike any new territory with Open Range, but it is an immensely satisfying addition to the Western genre anyway.  Paired with the always watchable Robert Duvall, the two play off of each other with the relaxed familiarity of the two trail companions and long-time friends they portray.<p>Filmed with wonderful appreciation for the natural surroundings and beauties of the Open Range and in real weather, with wind and rain only adding to the texture and reality of what is, in many ways, a romantic film, the film unfolds its story rather than jumpcutting it all over the place.  This ain't Matrix, it takes its time.<p>It is old-fashioned in that regard, building slowly to the inevitable showdown.  This climactic shootout is a dandy, by the way, beautifully staged and with the shock and surprise of actual gun-fighting.<p>There is a love interest.  There is some slightly corny moments.  There is a lot of laconic and terse dialogue between Duvall and Costner.  There are vile villains.  Many may not care for the icons & touchstones of the genre.  I didn't mind it at all.<p>Costner has turned in a solid effort here.  Well played by all, including Annette Benning and tbe late Michael Jeter.  It may not break new ground, but it certainly goes over familiar ground in a distinctive and sure-footed way.  Well done in all departments, a very good movie.</p></body></html>

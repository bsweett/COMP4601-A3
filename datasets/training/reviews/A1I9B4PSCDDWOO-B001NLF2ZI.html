<meta name="summary" content="Solid but uneven movie"></head><body><p>The Interpreter proves to be a solid but uneven movie about this woman played by Nicole Kidman who overheard an assassin plot against this dictator of a fictional African country while at work in the United Nation. Ironically, she is also from that country as well long ago. Sean Penn played a Secret Service agent who had to investigate and access the threat to that dictator who will be coming to the UN and also checked out Nicole Kidman's character as well.<br /><br />The general story moves along pretty well. The main characters are well developed. The movie played along as a some sort of a "spy thriller", a lot of cloak and dagger type of theme. Both Penn and Kidman's characters shared a same common problem of losing love ones and dealing with it. Both actors proves to be quite good in their roles. I am pleased that for once, Sean Penn isn't his usual outrageous self that some fans like him to be. He is very restraint in this movie, letting his body do his talking for him. Kidman I thought, was quite believable character and she proves herself to be a solid actress despite of her good looks. (Some reviewers actually panned Penn because he was so restraint.)<br /><br />Overall, the story works but only up to a certain point. The script wasn't as tight as it should be. By middle of the movie, you began to see thing far more clearly then what the director intented. The only real killer however, was the ending. After all that talk about forgiving, why would the movie end the way it did?? And what govenment would released a would be assassin based on a word of a secret service agent. Maybe I am giving away too much here in this review but overall, the ending hurt the film because its lack creditablity and believablity in contrast to the rest of the film.<br /><br />Amazingly, no sex scenes, no romance between the two leading actors, I guess they were just too busy staying alive and doing their jobs. That proves to be quite refreshing.<br /><br />Overall, pretty solid movie like I wrote before. But it could have been so much better if the director and scriptwriter didn't fall flat on their faces at the end. (I would give it a 3.6 stars rating if I had a choice.)</p></body></html>

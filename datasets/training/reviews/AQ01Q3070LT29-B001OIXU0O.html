<meta name="summary" content="ABBA songs from the 1970's become a musical, Mamma Mia!"></head><body><p>The touring musical, MAMMA MIA! now becomes a musical movie. Rated "PG-13". Running Time: 1 hour, 48 mins.<br /><br />Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is getting married in your birth town of Kalokairi, Greece. She wants her dad to give her away, but she doesn't know who her father is. So she invites all three men, Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) and Harry (Colin Firth). They think that her mother sent the invitations.<br />She has not told her mother, Donna (Meryl Streep) yet.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Christine Baranski, Julie Walters, Dominic Cooper.<br /><br /> Meryl Streep and Piecre Brosnan singing?  The singing in this musical is mediocre, but you might enjoy the songs which came from the Swedish pop-rock group, ABBA (1972-83).<br /><br />ABBA was Benny Andersson, Anna-Frid Lyngstad, Agnetha Faltskog, Bjorn Ulvaeus. Their songs were so popular, they were used in 1999 in the touring musical, MAMMA MIA!.<br /><br /> I did not like this movie too well, but I thought Amanda Seyfried was perfect for her role. She did a wonderful job.<br /><br /> Option to turn on "Sing Along".<br /><br /> Option of Language and Subtitles: English, Spanish, French.<br /><br /> Feature Commentary with Director Phyllida Lloyd.<br /><br /> Meryl Streep also sang in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AM6IS">Silkwood</a> (1983).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NFNFLC">Ironweed</a> (1987).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059XTI">Postcards from the Edge</a> (1990).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H6SXYM">A Prairie Home Companion</a> (2006).<br /><br /> If you did not like the movie, Mamma Mia! (2008), may I recommend:<br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KZOVJK">Evil Under the Sun</a> (1982).<br />  It's a good Agatha Christie mystery. It's not a musical, I promise.</p></body></html>

The movie is just great, and the DVD is cool, it has those extra features, I was surprised to learn that the "flying effects" were not done by computer graphics, but rather with cables. <p>This is a mixture of fantasy and martial arts. The fighting scenes and chases are spectacular, and this is a beautiful film in that it was shot perfectly. And all the actors did a great job. This has the best elements of Oriental, American and European cinematography.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="GOOD BUT NOT GREAT"></head><body><p>Yes, this is an entertaining movie, very well made, and has a lot of funny variables on the recurring events of GROUNDHOG DAY.  Murray is good in his role; Andie McDowell even better.  But I can't call it a &quot;classic&quot; because there are times when enough is enough.  With no explanation for the time warp or its resolution, it's hard to understand just why Bill is reliving each day.  Even as the story progresses and Bill finally becomes a decent, caring man, we've had to wade through a lot of redundancy that the screenplay didn't necessitate.  But I'd be a Scrooge to say it isn't a happy entertainment.  Some of the supporting characters in Puxta..whatever? are fun, and it's unique the way director Harold Ramis alters some of the recurring scenes, especially obnoxious Stephen Tobolowsky's, Hi I'm (I've forgotten his name already).<br />Admittedly enjoyable, but not the &quot;best comedy ever!&quot;</p></body></html>

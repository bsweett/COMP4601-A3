Hey, Larry Talbot goes home to a spooky old mansion and a weird old man, and there's a wolfman out in the countryside tearing some viscious Ay that's going to give him a very nasty bite.  The film looks great and there's atmosphere aplenty, and it moves quickly and wastes no time getting down to the business of eviscerating mayhem.  It both honored and updated the old film nicely.  Weirder and bloodier, but that's about right for an update.  I liked the interim in the insane asylum and the other tweaks to the story, and with the help of Rick Baker's terrific prosthetics you get some stunning transformations.  Yeah, of course there's CGI, but I thought it was used pretty much only where necessary.  As an aside, I thought it was eerie how much Benecio Del Toro suggested a thinner Lon Chaney Jr.<br /><br />I dunno, I went to see a monster movie, and that's what I got.  A pretty darn good one too, that ripped along with a flourish.  There was no deception.  I wasn't expecting King Lear, so I wasn't disappointed.  Worth it if you like monster movies.  If you don't, why would you go?</p></body></html>

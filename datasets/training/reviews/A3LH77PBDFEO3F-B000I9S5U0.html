He doesn't seem like the kind of guy I would like to know.<br /><br />But after reluctantly watching this film, I have to say he has a brilliant talent. Cinderella Man is a heartwarming and touching, and in the end inspirational film. How is it I never heard the story of James J. Braddock before?<br /><br />Ron Howard continues to surprise as a director, getting better and better.<br /><br />If you want to see a well directed, well acted, inspirational film this is the one.</p></body></html>

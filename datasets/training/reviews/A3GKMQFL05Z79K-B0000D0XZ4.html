<meta name="summary" content="Hulk....."></head><body><p>Despite everyone else not liking Ang Lee's version of The Hulk, I-for one- loved his take on the Green Goliath. Sure, the movie has it's flaws but I've got to give him props for giving us something different than we were expecting. True, he took some liberties with the source material but, overall, it was true to the comic book. Anyone who's read the Hulk comic book will know that General Ross spent alot of his time going after the character in the comic book. Ang was dead-on in picking Eric Bana for the role of Bruce Banner, in my opinion, as he's a dead-on ringer for the comic book Bruce Banner(minus glasses, of course). I give him credit for fleshing out characters and developing the story so we'd understand things alot more as to why Hulk is on the run all the time. This is a comic-book movie in the truest sense of it. If I had any gripes, whatsoever, it would be that there wasn't as much action in the movie as I'd like it to have. Action as in Hulk battling  and generally wreaking havoc. His battle with his father towards the end wasn't much of a battle at all. Other than that, I thought Hulk was a pretty decent movie. People need to quit ragging on this movie so much. It wasn't THAT bad.</p></body></html>

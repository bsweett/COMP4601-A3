Sequels are rarely better than their predecessors, but X-Men United shows improvement on almost every front.  The acting is solid, the effects and filming are even more amazing than before, and the plot is head and shoulders better than the first, which was in many ways a rehash of the comic books.  This is a testament to the work of Bryan Singer (also responsible for King Kong) and the writers, and proof that popular entertainment does not have to be completely banal.<br /><br />The story kicks off when the president's office is invaded by a mutant.  A demonic looking teleporter who seems to be a representative of a mutant's lib movement.  A barb tailed terrorist who is, for all purposes, unstoppable.  In the chaos that ensues William Stryker (Brian Cox) steps in with a plan to invade Professor Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) school and capture the mutants.  The attack is only partially successful, and it quickly becomes clear to the viewer and the X-Men that Stryker's agenda is more than defending the president.  He wants to destroy all mutants driven by his own anger over Xavier's failure to 'cure' his son.<br /><br />Cox is brilliant as the psychotic Stryker, and with a villain so despicable that Magneto seems almost likeable, you will quickly become emotionally involved in the race to keep all out war from breaking out between the increasing number of mutants and populations that feel threatened by those whose powers seem almost magical.  As such, the story becomes a parable of human fear in the face of things beyond our control and how quickly that turns to anger and violence.<br /><br />The film introduces many new faces that will become more important in later films (such as the so far ill-fated X-Men 3).  Pyro (John Allerdyce), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), and Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), for example.  The latter, by the way turns in an outstanding performance in a supporting role.  Hats off to the unsung heroes who do the animation and effects work as well - everything seems smooth and seamless.  By all means make a point to see this if you haven't already.</p></body></html>

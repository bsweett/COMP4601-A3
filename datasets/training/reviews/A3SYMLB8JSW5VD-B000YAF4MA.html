Cole and Chambers played by Nicholson and Freeman both discovered that they have terminal cancer. Their friendship starts out very rocky. But soon discovered that they inspired each other in ways unimaginable hence the bucket list. Also Sean Hayes is great in this movie as well. It touch you in ways that it helps you to see how to treat others and how to make the most out of life.</p></body></html>

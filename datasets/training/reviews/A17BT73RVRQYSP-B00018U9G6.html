I didn't know if my kids wanted to see it but was unsure if it would be proper for them.  I then read Roger Eberts review and decided to give it a shot since the kids wanted to see it.<p>Good Move<p>This movie works on every level.  The music is excellent, the comedy is well timed and well delivered, the kids are, well, kids. (and that makes half the movie right there)<p>This movie will have such cross appeal that it will do a killer box office and it deserves it.  I just hope that we don't see a sequel, however given the response of the crowd and the quality of the picture it is inevitable.<p>Watch it AND buy it.</p></body></html>

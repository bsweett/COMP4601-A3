<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Hitchcock Thriller!"></head><body><p>With a classy Bernard Hermann score, Hitchcock lets us in on the story of an advertising exec, Mr. Thornhill, who likes his job, considering advertising as exaggerating the facts for the public.<br /><br />(Hitch makes one of his famous on screen appearances, and doesn't quite make the bus!)<br /><br />It's fun, though a bit unrealistic, that an advertising man who was just kidnapped would then follow up on the guys who tried to kidnap him, investigate the hotel room of the "real" Kaplan and go through these adventures. But that's fine, it's still a lot of fun.<br /><br />Each scene has him take a step closer to finding out more about the kidnappers, narrow escapes, chase scenes and thrilling near-misses.<br /><br />The cinematography is superb. The 30th floor view as Thornhill runs out -- the unusual perspective shots, the mistaken identifies and mistaken situations -- the logical illogic, the puzzles and the plots and plans -- All doves together in a crescendo of simple if deadly delights for the viewer.<br /><br />But not for Thornhill.<br /><br />[Some minor plot reveals here]<br /><br />A blonde on the train (but who is she, really?) a little romance & comedy adds to the grim specter of a very long jail sentence or the bad spies rub him out!<br /><br />Best scenes of course include:<br /><br />The biplane scene that sprays bullets rather than insecticide on our poor Mr. Thornhill.<br /><br />The Mt. Rushmore scene that has lots of near misses and very tall heights to climb and nearly be killed by, especially with Martin Landau chasing you down!<br /><br />There's a double-cross, there's James Mason (as actually the evil spy Van Damme), lots of near misses -- I keep saying that but it's true. The film is full of near misses!<br /><br />Recommended, highly so.</p></body></html>

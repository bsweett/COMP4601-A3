However, take someone with you to hold on to.  It has the ingredients of classic horror flicks of the past and the sounds, scenes and expressions are a script for terror.  I felt my skin crawl for the first hour and jumped out of it (my skin, that is) five times.  It's been a long time since a film has had that effect on me...and I'm an avid horror flick fan.  It has bits and pieces of &quot;Cujo&quot;, &quot;Pet Sematary&quot;, &quot;Poltergeist&quot; and a little-known low-budget classic &quot;The Funhouse&quot;.  I give the first hour FIVE stars.  It drops to an overall rating of 4 as the horror dwindles and dwindles and dwindles.  But you are so frightened from the outset, it keeps you on your seat till the end.  Only two nagging points --- the sound of the failing transmission in Trish's Chevy...and Darryl's overused facial expressions of terror.  Other than that...GO SEE IT!  It'll give you the creeps...jeepers creepers, that is.</p></body></html>

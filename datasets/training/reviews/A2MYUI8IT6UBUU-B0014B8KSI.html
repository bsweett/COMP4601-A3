<meta name="summary" content="Michael Clayton Movie Review"></head><body><p>In the world of big money, big businesses, and big law firms, anything can be covered up. And with as hard-hitting and satisfyingly clever an ending as the one that closes Michael Clayton, even earlier faults within the film can quickly become erased from our minds. While the climactic payoff gives the audience everything they've been waiting so patiently for, it's still a shame that the film takes its time to examine too many characters and their involvement in Clayton's seemingly undefined and shady responsibilities.<br /><br />Father. Brother. Gambler. Legal advisor. Law firm "Fixer" and "Bagman". Michael Clayton (George Clooney) is all of these and more. Leading a troubled and infinitely complex lifestyle of fixing problems, Clayton becomes embroiled in a multi-million dollar law suit to cover up damaging evidence against U-North, a powerful corporation. His main opponent is a man on his side, a lawyer (Tom Wilkinson) who has suddenly seen the errors of working with corruption and greed. Added to the mix is U-North litigator Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) whose success relies on Clayton's failure. As the stakes become higher and the loose ends more dangerous, Clayton must choose a side and attempt to defy those with the power to alter the truth.<br /><br />Michael Clayton takes the increasingly familiar narration of starting almost at the end, backtracking to the beginning, going forward to the starting point, and then finishing from there. It may sound complex, but it's deceptively simple. The problem is that early on the audience is shown the outcome of Clayton's suspenseful car ride, which causes the nonlinear storyline to be completely unnecessary. Other films utilize this chopped up narrative by withholding dramatic truths until the end. But Michael Clayton shows the viewer every secret up front, numbing any suspense being formed from the added details as the film catches back up to itself.<br /><br />The structuring of the film is occasionally tiresome and many of the events are underdeveloped. Add to that the unusually high amount of characters all with several lines of dialogue and what could have been a fast-paced thriller leans more to the side of ploddingly amusing. So many characters and not enough time spent with each means that several sequences and worthlessly complex events could easily have been cut or trimmed. Fortunately Clooney's Clayton is so engrossing that the audience never tires of his formulaic pondering or his generic family life. What does work surprisingly well is the constantly intense score that permeates every minute element to increase its impact on the film, and George Clooney's flawless performance as the intriguing title character.<br /><br />The genre that Michael Clayton falls into is a tired one, but director Tony Gilroy manages to give us something that never gets boring - Clooney at his brooding best and a solid drama with an ending as explosive as its beginning. Though its faults may be numerous when examined closely, the entertainment value remains high with exceptionally powerful performances, sharp dialogue, and a methodic build to a sensational finish. While keeping track of all the characters involved may be rather dizzying, there's no forgetting Michael Clayton.<br /><br />- The Massie Twins</p></body></html>

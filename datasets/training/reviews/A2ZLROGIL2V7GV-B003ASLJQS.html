<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Sometimes, I think all three of us got in that car...&quot;"></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood has directed a masterpiece which is most likely his best work ever.  Completely character driven and full of tension, drama and danger, &quot;Mystic River&quot; is a cinematic experience that shouldn't be passed up.  For those 130+ minutes, I was intrigued and amazed.  It's a film that doesn't rely on action or senseless non-stop violence, but it relies only on the characters.<p>Jimmy, Dave and Sean were best friends when they were kids, but something terrible happened.  Dave was abducted by two strangers posing as cops one day, only to be held captive and abused (physically, and by &quot;other&quot; means).  He did manage to escape, but the experience has forever scarred him.  Years later when all three are grown up, they are reunited when a horrible crime arises--Jimmy's nineteen-year-old daughter ends up murdered.  Sean's a cop who is on the case and Dave, still deeply disturbed by the past, is acting very strange and suspiciously.  The childhood past that these three had has paved the paths of their lives today, which has set in motion these chain-of-events.  It is a sad story that can only end in tragedy that will affect all three in unimaginable ways.<p>On the surface, this seems like a mystery/thriller when it is anything but that.  True, it is a murder mystery, but the murder is not what the movie is really about.  It's about how the past can never be forgotten and how these three individuals have turned out as a result.  You see the characters and how they deal with the tragedy that has befallen them.  The mind frame, the course of action, and the need of closure all play a very important role in this tension-filled drama.  It's one of those rare films where you could've watched it unfold forever.  Clint Eastwood has done a marvelous job of directing this masterpiece of human tragedy and loss.<p>It has to be said.  The cast is PHENOMENAL.  The cast could've really made this film a complete and utter failure if the wrong people were chosen, but that is not the case here.  Everybody was outstanding.  Sean Penn and Tim Robbins give it their all in making their roles come to life.  I now know why the two won Academy Awards, and they deserve them very much.  Kevin Bacon is terrific and comes off more than just a simple cop.  Laurence Fishburne was a complete joy to watch, as well.  I didn't even know that he was in this until I bought the DVD, and he was brilliant in a stand-out role.  What it all comes down to is that the complete cast is terrific.  Not one wasted talent can be found in this entire film.<p>There are two versions of this movie you can buy--not counting the widescreen/full screen versions.  You can either buy the &quot;bare bones&quot; version that has absolutely no special features whatsoever, or you can buy the &quot;Deluxe Edition,&quot; which is three discs.  I bought the &quot;Deluxe Edition.&quot;  While it is a pretty nice package, I wouldn't really call this edition of the movie &quot;Deluxe.&quot;  Special features included are two making-of featurettes, Charlie Rose interviews with Eastwood, Robbins and Bacon (all separate interviews), two trailers and audio commentary given by Robbins and Bacon.  The third disc is a CD that is the soundtrack to the movie with the score composed by Clint Eastwood.  Like I said, nice package, but nothing really &quot;Deluxe&quot; about it.  It's up to you whether you want to get a version that has no extras in sight or pay a little more for a couple of nice features.<p>&quot;Mystic River&quot; is an unforgettable, heart-breaking and overwhelming film that really can show you how fantastic a movie can be if you have the characters and the emotion.  Not everyone will enjoy it, as it isn't action-packed, but for those who love character development are in for a real treat.  If you haven't seen it yet, I really recommend checking it out.  It's definitely one of the better movies to come out of 2003.  It's a shame it had to come out the same year as &quot;Return of the King,&quot; otherwise I really think this film could've won a few more awards. -Michael Crane</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Both versions are disappointments for their own reasons"></head><body><p>It is certainly too bad that Lucas has decided to treat the 1977 version of Star Wars with such low regard, especially considering the fact that it was those of us that showed up to the theaters in droves to see this film thirty years ago that made his "empire" what it became. All I wanted was to see the exact scenes in the exact sequence that I saw them in back in 1977 with the same hokie sound effects, men running around in rubber costumes portraying all of the various creatures, and poorly rendered graphics. After all, that is all part of the nostalgia, and the nostalgia is all part of the fun. However, I did expect to see the film at least "cleaned up" from an audio and visual perspective, and that I did not get. As for the 2004 edition, that feature gets the royal treatment, but you have to put up with the infamous altering of Han's shootout with Greedo, as well as all of the added scenes, including digitally added dinosaur-like creatures that were considered state-of-the art when Jurassic Park came out 16 years after this movie was made. Neither makes for a satisfying film viewing experience for an oldster such as myself with a preconceived notion of what I want to see.<br /><br />Apparently, the fact that these double-feature releases of the original Star Wars trilogy haven't sold well has us in a circular argument with its creator. You see, fewer people than expected have bought this set, since they are waiting for the 9-disc Ultimate Star Wars Saga to come out in a boxed set. However, Lucas is now determined to hold off putting out the trilogy boxed set for that very reason. Due to poor sales of this set he now intends to wait until 2008 or 2009 to release the long-awaited trilogy boxed set. The information in this last paragraph comes from the Feb. 23 post at The Rumor Mill of digitalbits, so it is still, after all, just a rumor. At any rate, something has to be done to stop Lucas from continuing to be the Darth Vader of digital editing. I really don't believe this business about Lucas' vision continuing to drive him to tinker - or not tinker - with these films. I think the original success of Star Wars surprised Lucas as much as anyone. After all, the original commercials for Star Wars back in 1977 said "This summer see Star Wars ... just for the fun of it".</p></body></html>

Is this movie supposed to be a cartoon?  I know movies can be unrealistic, but this movie is SO RIDICULOUSLY UNREALISTIC I found myself staring at the screen in disbelief.  What did this man not do in his lifetime?  It's as though he has been blessed by God and everything falls into his hands.  The moral of the story.. STAY STUPID AND OBLIVIOUS YOUR ENTIRE LIFE AND MIRACLES WILL HAPPEN TO YOU.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tried to watch it twice..... unable to sit thru it"></head><body><p>Okay, okay I know there are fans of this movie that will want to make me walk the plank for this review...BUT...... I was unable to get interested in this movie in the least !!!!!<p>I tried twice to sit down and watch this movie but each time my mind wandered to other things. The movie simply did not grab my interest or attention in the least.<p>Naval battle.... get drunk and eat... naval battle... get drunk and eat... that got old real fast.<p>I found myself grabbing magazines to read and other things to distract me while this movie played.<p>The second time I turned to my wife and asked... "Do you mind if I stop this movie ?"<p>Her reply.... "Go ahead. I'm not watching it anyway. I fell asleep first time and this time I'm doing needlepoint. This film is lame and boring."<p>So we never made it past about 50 minutes before just giving in to pure boredom and the mental torture of dragging thru this bloated artsy-fartsy film.<p>Great cinematography... great costumes.... great historical accuracy... but if I want a documentary I'll watch History Channel and actually enjoy a real history lesson.... not Hollywood's attempt at being cerebral or whatever.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mike Nichols' Directing & Brilliant Acting Save This Film"></head><body><p>MOVIE: In reality I would give this film three stars instead of four. The premise is very unreal, very over the top, and just too vivid at times. But it is powerful and has a certain style. What makes this film entertaining are the actors and Mike Nichols. The movie revolves between two couples. At first they love each other then they don't, now they do, now they don't. It jumps around a lot and that shows one major flaw of the movie. At some points the movie jumps huge amounts of time, at one point it was a year. Basically skipping all the build up in the relationship and just showing the intense parts of it. I agree that this was the best way of doing this, but I just felt not involved with the movie since all we are seeing are bullets on a timeline of events. The movie is intense at times and is revealing of a darker more perverse side of human nature, love. The movie explores just how twisted the human heart is as well as the mind. Some of the dialogue is very explicit. And what makes the movie so unique is that Mike Nichols was able to take all this harshness of humanity and turn it into a very delicate film. As you watch the movie, you get a sense that the lives of these people are so fragile even though their emotions, if unleashed, could devour a corpse. I just found it interesting how they were able to craft the film so well.<br /><br />ACTING: The acting in the movie was great and believable. Natalie Portman plays a similar role to Kate Winslet in Eternal Sunshine, but just a little more fragile. Julie Roberts is the elegant woman, Jude Law the desperate man, and Clive Owen the butcher. I'm a big fan of Clive Owen and I thought he delivered a very chilling performance here. Again, the acting made the movie. Oscar winning director, Mike Nichols, also gave the movie its style. If it weren't for the talent of the actors and the crew I assure you that this movie would be very mediocre.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Entertaining and fun, but not at all thought provoking. You'll be impacted by the intense acting and dialogue, but underneath it there's really nothing there. I was really never intending to see this movie, but when Sideways was sold out this was the second choice. Hopefully I'll get to see it next.</p></body></html>

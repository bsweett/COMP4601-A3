Life is tough for Yuri; frustrated and poor, he realizes that he's not really that good at anything, with the world pretty much offering him a ticket to know where. When we first meet him, around 1982, he is longing to bust out of the kosher restaurant owned by his father, who fervently keeps up the charade of being Jewish that he invented so he could get his family expelled from the Soviet Union.<br /><br />I guess when you're raised on a lie; it becomes pretty easy to keep the pretense up. Yuri, recognizing he has a talent for being in the wrong place at the right time, hatches a plan with his kid-brother Vitali (Jared Leto) to sell arms and ammunitions: "that was the day I realized my destiny lay in fulfilling another basic human need." Of course, there isn't much business for this kind of thing in the States, so Yuri and Vitali find themselves doing business in Berlin during the height of the Cold War.<br /><br />Their criminal trade eventually takes them to South America, where Vitali gets hooked on coke, and where, for the first time, they meet their arch nemesis Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke), an idealistic Interpol agent.  But the bulk of Yuri's fortune is made when the Soviet Union crumbles and its vast cache of weapons is made available to him.<br /><br />Now Yuri is free to sell his product to war torn Africa, where he becomes professionally entangled with Liberian president Andre Baptiste (Eamonn Walker), a kind of Charles Taylor-like fanatical dictator. Along the way Yuri becomes a very rich man adopting a glamorous supermodel trophy wife Ava (Bridget Moynahan) and tries to help his brother Vitali beat his steady addiction to cocaine and alcohol.<br /><br />Director Andrew Nichol's movie is unapologetically purposeful, and his subject matter is incendiary and also quite timely. The devastating consequences of the weapons trade are well known, and Lord of War is a forceful film with a lot on its mind. Then why is the film so flat and un-involving? Perhaps because it's all so convoluted - Nichol probably has enough material here for five movies, consequently his narrative never complete meshes; it's as though Lord of War is a film in search of a decent plot.<br /><br />It doesn't help that Yuri is played by Cage, one of the most over-rated actors of his generation, doing his usual softly spoken, puppy dog shtick; he blusters when he should be quiet and raves when he should be contemplative. When the dialogue isn't enough to provide the facts, Nichol stuffs Yuri's mouth with cynical, and contemptuous narration to describe the dirty business in detail, but you really have to worry about a film when Yuri's verbal announcements are far more intriguing than the fictional plot devices used to provide human drama.<br /><br />I guess you could say that Lord of War is mildly intriguing when it deals with the nuts and bolts of the weapons business, and it often sails along with a nifty, amoral irreverence. But it's just too overly didactic and preachy, ultimately sinking under the weight of it's own message and pretensions. What really does this film in is the director's penchant for turning Yuri into a character that we should care about.<br /><br />There are a few cheeky moments complete with some funny lines, but after forty minutes or so, it all becomes terribly repetitive. After all, we've got the message in the opening credits, which follow the life of a bullet from the factory to the forehead of a third-world teenager. Mike Leonard January 06.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Last King of Scotland"></head><body><p>Scottish doctor Nicholas Garrigan (McAvoy) leaves Scotland after his graduation to get away from his father.  He goes to Uganda around the time that a military coup puts General Idi Amin (Whitaker) in charge of the country.  When Amin is injured in a car accident, Nicholas treats him.  Amin likes Nicholas and offers him a position as personal physician to the President.  He accepts, and soon finds that although Amin is personable and charismatic, he is also paranoid and brutal.  This is further complicated by Nicholas having an affair with Amin's third wife (Washington).  With each passing day, Amin becomes more unstable, and Nicholas finds that he cannot escape.<br /><br />"The Last King of Scotland" is an excellent film.  The two leads, Forest Whitaker and James McAvoy deliver standout performances.  They hype for Whitaker in this movie is well deserved.  It is a shame that McAvoy has not garnered similar praise.  This film offers a look into how the charismatic Amin became one of Africa's most vicious dictators.  I highly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

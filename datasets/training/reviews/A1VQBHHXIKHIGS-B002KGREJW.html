<meta name="summary" content="Quite Humorous"></head><body><p>The humor comes quite naturally from a realistic group of characters and how they relate to one another.  The filmmakers are to be commended for that.  It helps that all the actors did such a fine job of bringing everyone to life as well.<br /><br />And yet, believe it or not, it could be more complex.<br /><br />Did I laugh out loud more than once?  I did, and not just at that ending.  (People who've watched it know what I mean.)<br /><br />It's a "road movie" that you're sure to enjoy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Matt an action hero?"></head><body><p>Wow! Who would have thought Matt Damon would be a great action/James Bond type? It worked well! This is definitely a good role for him. Action, romance and revenge makes this an A+ movie.<br /><br />A hitman loses his identity and spends the rest of the movie trying to figure out who he is while along the way he finds the woman for him and the truth he needs to move on with his life.</p></body></html>

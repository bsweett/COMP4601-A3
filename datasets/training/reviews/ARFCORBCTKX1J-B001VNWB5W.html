And it /is/ an improvement, which explains my two-star review of the film (compared to my one-star review of the novel -- QV, as they say in Latin).<br /><br />No one has had the guts to stand up and say that the novel is a shallow and ultimately pointless work. The issues raised by "Watchmen" were raised more than 70 years ago when Superman and Batman became the prototypes of almost every superhero to come. They need little elaboration, any more than one needs to be told that water is wet. Dr Wertham was wrong about comic books causing anti-social behavior, but he and other philosophers/psychologists correctly analyzed why super-heroes are (for better or worse) popular.<br /><br />There are no real-world superheros (as much as people like Ronald Reagan might like to think there are), which therefore renders super-hero comics a self-contained and self-referential commentary on themselves and society. A commentary /on/ a commentary, from a comic-book writer, seems pointless navel-gazing. My reaction to the novel was largely "Yeah, right... So what?".<br /><br />The film blunts much (but not enough) of the novel's intellectual pretentiousness, while discarding too much of its moral ambiguity. We are left feeling that Ozymandias was justified in killing millions of people to prevent a much greater catastrophe. And the idea that the governments of the Earth would unite against a common foe and stop fighting among themselves is not plausible. "The Shield of Achilles" gives a not-unreasonable explanation of the sources of human warfare, which would not be long-suppressed by an alien enemy. *<br /><br />The film's dialog is not far-removed from the novel's, which is unfortunate. It's not at the level of Stephen J Cannell, let alone "The Sopranos". The acting is barely adequate, with Malin Ackerman decidedly unconvincing. The actor playing Nixon has been given a prosthetic nose that makes him look as if he's auditioning for a production of "Cyrano".<br /><br />Ultimately, I find "Watchmen" not so much pointless as a shallow rehash of the patently obvious. It holds your attention, though, and its 3-hour running time passes quickly and smoothly.<br /><br />"Watchmen" is an extremely violent film, which I don't consider suitable for anyone under 17 or 18, even with parents in attendance. There are scenes of two dogs fighting over the leg bone of a little girl they've torn to pieces, and a convict having his arms cut off with a circular saw. A decade ago, these would likely have gotten the film an NC-17. And people complain about "Brokeback Mountain".<br /><br />* The film changes the foe from an alien invasion to Dr Manhattan.</p></body></html>

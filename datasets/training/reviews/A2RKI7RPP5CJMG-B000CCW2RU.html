Sure, it looked like a really cool action yarn, but something about it was holding me back.  Well, I finally got up the courage to check this film out and I have to admit that it was a rather good movie.  Directed by Michael Bay, who's directed such action fare as "Armageddon" and "The Rock," the viewer is insured that there will be plenty of explosions and gunplay.<br /><br />The story is rather compelling.  In the near future, a doctor (played sinisterly to perfection by Sean Bean) develops a way to create clones that match the age and makeup of an actual person.  These clones supply spare parts for their respective "clients."  Think of it as a sort of biological auto shop.  One of the clones, Lincoln Six-Echo (Ewan McGregor), starts to question the alternate reality that he and his fellow clones are residing in.  As the days go by, clones win the "Lottery" and are sent to the Island.  In other words, lottery winners are sent to a medical unit where they are basically gutted for livers, hearts, kidneys, etc.  Some of the female clones are used for breeding so that their client won't have to go through child labor, nursing, or any of the other pains of motherhood.  McGregor's character is also drawn to Scarlett Johansson's character, Jordan Two-Delta.  When she wins the lottery, McGregor escapes with her to learn the ugly truth of what is actually going on.  Of course, in true Michael Bay style, explosions and countless chases ensue.<br /><br />With a cast packed full of stars such as Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Steve Buscemi, you expect solid acting.  You get that in this film.  McGregor and Johansson are a likeable pair, and McGregor takes on two roles as the film unfolds.  As stated before, Sean Bean is stellar as the doctor who is unrelenting in his attempt to capture the escaped clones and protect his investment. There are also some recognizable faces from televison with rather brief but valuable contributing roles.<br /><br />This film is really plot driven, which is a departure somewhat for Bay.  However, he really shines with the action sequences.  From heart-pounding car/jetbike(WASP) chases to good ol' shoot'em ups.  Bay covers all territories nicely.  Most of the action is flawless, though a few of the CGI sequences can be picked apart.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really good film worthy of multiple viewings.  If you enjoy films such as "Equilibrium" (also starred Sean Bean), "Minority Report," or "The Rock," you're sure to love this film.  If you like action films in general, this one will take your breath away.  Definitely a purchase for the sci-fi and action fan.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

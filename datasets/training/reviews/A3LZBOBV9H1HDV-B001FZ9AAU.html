<meta name="summary" content=""Iron Man" is excellent!"></head><body><p>"Iron Man" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Tony Stark is a billionaire industrialist and genius inventor who is kidnapped and forced to build a devastating weapon. Instead, using his intelligence and ingenuity, Tony builds a high-tech suit of armor and escapes captivity. When he uncovers a nefarious plot with global implications, he dons his powerful armor and vows to protect the world as Iron Man. The cast led by  Robert Downey Jr. (in a terrific career-defining performance as Tony Stark / Iron Man), Terrence Howard (as Jim Rhodes), Jeff Bridges (as Obadiah Stane / Iron Monger), and Gwyneth Paltrow (as Virginia 'Pepper' Potts) is excellent! The directing by Jon Favreau (who also directed "Elf" (2003), "Zathura" (2005), & "Made" (2001) is excellent! The screenplay (which is based on characters by Stan Lee, Don Heck, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby) by Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby (both who also wrote the Oscar-nominated screenplay for "Children Of Men" (2006), Art Marcum, & Matt Holloway (both who also wrote the story and screenplay to the upcoming "Punisher: War Zone" (2008) is excellent! The music by Ramin Djawadi (who also did the music to "Mr. Brooks" (2007) & the tv show "Prison Break") is excellent! The cinematography by Matthew Libatique (who also did the cinematography to "The Number 23" (2007) is excellent! The film editing by Dan Lebental (who also did the film editing to "Elf" & "Zathura") is excellent! The casting by Sarah Finn & Randi Hiller (who also did the casting to "Vantage Point" (2008), "Never Back Down" (2008), & the upcoming "You Don't Mess With The Zohan" (2008) is excellent! The production design by J. Michael Riva (who also did the production design to "Zathura" & "Spider-Man 3" (2007) is excellent! The art direction by Suzan Wexler (who also did the art direction to "Spider-Man 3" & the upcoming "The Soloist" (2008), which also stars Downey, Jr.) is excellent! The set decoration by Lauri Gaffin (who also did the set decoration to "Zathura" & the upcoming "Land Of The Lost" (2009) is excellent! The costume design by Laura Jean Shannon (who also did the costume design to "Elf", "Zathura", & "Made") is excellent! This is an action-adventure comic-book movie that works on all cylinders. Robert Downey, Jr. was born to play Tony Stark / Iron Man. This is one of the best films of the year, if not, the best, by so far, this year. This is also a excellent movie to start the summer movie season off.</p></body></html>

However, I never overheard a clear explanation of the plot and what I did hear was more confusing than helpful; a dramatic story built around a gameshow.  In addition, I read where 2009 was such a mediocre year that a movie like "Slumdog Millionaire" might end up as Best Picture come Oscar time.<br /><br />"Slumdog Millionaire" IS a very good movie.  As it began, I thought that I was finding out too much too soon.  With all this information up front, how would the rest of the movie keep my attention.  Before long I realized the brilliance of its' cinematic concept; the answer to each question on the game show was learned in the school of Hard Knocks by our improbable hero, Jamal Malik.  Jamal has lived a tough life and every tragedy and misfortune was etched in his memory.  His seemimgly emotionless reaction to each correct answer on "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" was a testimony to the suffering the answer brought to mind.  Naturally, the movie lets us in on the "stories behind the answers".  Along the way, we meet other characters important in Jamal's life as they weave in and out of his story.  The ending is somewhat predictable but we would be greatly disappointed otherwise.<br /><br />I guess "Slumdog Millionaire" IS a dramatic story built around a game show.  However, it didn't take a mediocre year to give it a chance to win Best Picture.  It would have competed in any other year as well.</p></body></html>

Jack Black stars as Dewey Finn, a down-on-his-luck rock musician who is out of work and out of excuses.  Well, with a little fast talking and identity theft Finn takes the identity of his zombie roommate and assumes the role of substitute teacher at a prestigious academy.  The kids he is to teach are expecting him to teach standard school subjects.  Dewey, a rock musician, is not prepared to teach them anything.  But, there is one subject that touches his soul--that is rock music.  It turns out that several of his students are musically inclined, and they end up developing a musical ensemble, while avoiding the suspicious unlooking of an uptight  school superintendent (Joan Cusak).  This is pure fantasy, but, Jack Black is a terrific physical comedian [comparable, perhaps, to the late, great Chris Farley].  The kids are hilarious and come from varying backgrounds and it's wonderful to watch Dewey bring them to life with music.  From what I have heard, this is one of the better Jack Black films.  I think that this is definitely worth a place in your NetFlix queue.  Very cute!</p></body></html>

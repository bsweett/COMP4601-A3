Your husband George McFly is a good man, but he's bedeviled with a crippling fear of failure, has a low-level job, and meekly puts up with his bullying supervisor Biff.  Between you, you've had three children, your youngest is Marty . . . .<br /><br />If you are Marty McFly you are a high school student.  You fantasize about being a rock star.  You get around on a skate board, but dream about one day owning a 4 x 4 truck.  Unlike your father, you stand up to bullies.  You are smitten with Jennifer Parker and your best friend is Doc Emmett Brown . . . .<br /><br />If you are Emmett you are a scientist who draws his inventive inspiration from Thomas Edison.  While many in Hill Valley may call you a nutcase - and it is true, that you have tinkered about, building many contraptions of dubious value - but now, at last, you've invented something of significance: a time machine . . . .<br /><br />You got the idea 30 years ago for an electronic device that has the capacity to join the present to either an instant in the future or the past.  For it to work: it must be moving at 88 mph; therefore you encased it in a car.  Its power requirements are enormous; unfortunately, tricking some bad guys out of their plutonium was a bad idea . . . .<br /><br />Note:  annoying Sub-Menu in "pause", "slow motion", or "fast motion" modes; partially covers subtitles.<br /><br />Spoken Languages: includes Spanish & French.<br /><br />Picture  (Blu-ray): 4.5 to 5.  Resolution test for DVD owners: in the first movie, first scene: try to read the tiny print above the headline: "BROWN MANSION DESTROYED"; it reads: "Thursday, August 2, ..." (the year is blurred).</p></body></html>

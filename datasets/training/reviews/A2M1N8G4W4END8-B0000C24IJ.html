<meta name="summary" content="A True Contender for CHAINSAW Successor"></head><body><p>In October 2003, New Line Cinema and director Marcus Nispel offered up a remake of Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic horror film THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE.  Ardent fans of the original were curious, but skeptical.  Would the new TCM match the rawness and realism of the original?  Could the new film raise adrenaline levels to the same soaring heights?  Was it possible that this remake would finally wrest the mantle of terror from the scariest slasher film ever?  Hardly.<p>Like the majority of film remakes, New Line's THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is a huge disappointment to ardent fans of the original.  In spite of some promising acting talent, Nispel and crew seem oblivious to the elements that made the original film so great.  Simply throwing out lots of disturbing or repulsive images does not a horror classic make.  The TCM remake will never assume the place of honor held by its older namesake.<p>But it can be convincingly argued that the year 2003 has offered a promising contender.  Although it is by no means meant to be a remake or an update of the original THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE, director Rob Schmidt's WRONG TURN is, in spirit at least, the heir apparent to Hooper's classic.  It offers the same basic plot elements: A group of young adults unwittingly stumble into the territory of a family of backwoodsy, cannibalistic southerners who relentlessly strive to place the young folk on the evening menu.  And unlike the ill-begotten TCM remake, WRONG TURN offers genuine chills, thrills, and scares rather than mere repugnant imagery, and it also shares the same dark sense of humor that permeated Hooper's film.<p>The characters in the original TCM were based in reality.  Tobe Hooper has said on many occasions that he based his cannibalistic family on Edward Gein, the real-life ghoul from Plainfield, Wisconsin, whose necrophilic and cannibalistic atrocities were discovered after his arrest for murder in the late 1950s.  Hooper also used his film to caricature southerners, specifically Texans, and to satirize their rural mores.  <p>In a similar vein, the villains in WRONG TURN are also founded in reality.  The venerable Stan Winston, producer and FX supervisor for the film, explains in one of the DVD featurettes that he and his crew did extensive research for the make-up design, and all of the physical deformities depicted in WRONG TURN are medically documented defects caused by generations of inbreeding.  Add to that the fact that there have long been legends about familial groups in the southern mountainous regions of the United States who have been sequestered away from civilization for generations, and it's not too much of a stretch to believe that inbred grotesqueries like those in WRONG TURN could really exist.  In a sense, then, the subtext of this film, like that of Hooper's TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE, is a darkly wry satire or caricature of the rural southern lifestyle.<p>In the feature commentary on the DVD version of WRONG TURN, director Schmidt states that, with this film, his aim was to re-create the atmosphere and scares of a 1970s-style horror movie.  In that, he definitely hit the bull's-eye.  So those who miss the horror flicks of the '70s will love this film, though any horror enthusiast will find it good fun.  And fans of Tobe Hooper's original THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE who were rightfully let down by the recent remake should forget that film and, instead, consider WRONG TURN to be the TCM for the new millennium.</p></body></html>

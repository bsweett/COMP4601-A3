<meta name="summary" content="Dennis Quaid has a major mid-life crisis at work"></head><body><p>The ads for "In Good Company" made it seem like a romantic comedy in which Topher Grace and Scarlett Johansson fall in love while Dennis Quaid pulls his hair out because Scarlett is his daughter but Topher is his boss.  But once you actually see the film it is clear the subject is not romance but big business, and this film belongs not to the youngsters but to Quaid.  In fact, the movie is more about the two guys, while Johansson and Marg Helgenberger are largely wasted, although each has good moments.<br /><br />Dan Foreman (Quaid) is past 50 and he thinks finding the box of an empty home pregnancy test in the garbage is the worst thing that could happen to him, but he is sadly mistaken.  Dan works as an ad-exec for a "Sports Illustrated" type magazine and there his biggest concern is trying to land a big client to place print aids in the age of the Internet.  Then the magazine is gobbled up by Teddy K (Malcolm McDowell), a Murodch type media mogul and Carter Duryea (Grace), a hotshot half Dan's age, is sent in to replace him.  The "good" news is that Dan gets to stay on as Carter's "wingman," but only because Carter is scared of his new responsibilities.  We know this because he confides it to Alex (Johansson) in the elevator, not knowing she is Dan's daughter.<br /><br />Dan cannot quit.  For that matter he cannot afford to be "let go," and it is not just because of his age.  Every time another one of his colleagues is "let go" only underscores his vulnerability.  So even when he learns that his boss is dating his daughter there is really nothing he can do about it.  But we know that it is only a matter of time until we get to the straw that breaks this camel's back.  Then the question is whether Dan goes out in a blaze of glory or if a happy ending can be salvaged from this mess.<br /><br />Writer-director Paul Weitz's movie has a couple of things working for it beyond the performances of the cast who largely follow Quaid's lead in inhabiting their roles with an ease that allows us to play along with the rough spots.  The main thing is that the character of Carter is in play.  He has been raised in the corporate world of Teddy K and his eager minions, but some of Dan's wisdom is starting to rub off on the kid.  Maybe he is only hanging on to Dan because firing the father of the woman you love is not the sort of romantic gesture that usually works.  Then there is seeing what the business world he has been living in looks like to those on the outside.<br /><br />The other part that works is the resolution to the story, which is certainly not what anybody would expect given everything that had been set up in the film.  With movies today having an ending that qualifies as anything like a surprise is commendable.  It also makes up for the problem with the big moment when Dan fights back against the new corporate order.  It really is a bit too little, too late, and the conveniently contrived last chance to save the day and the corporadum ex machine the finishes the job have to be taken with a grain of salt.  But "In Good Company" is, after all, a comedy and not a tragedy, which is what a realistic story about corporate take overs almost always has to end up being.</p></body></html>

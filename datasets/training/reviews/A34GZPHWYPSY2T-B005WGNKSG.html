Swedish title 'M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor', from the original novel by Stieg Larsson, 2009, 135 minutes) was quite the wild ride - and not for the faint of heart. This Swedish instant classic is, like all Swedish film, unashamed about showing truth as realistically as possible. Yet I must confess that with all I have seen in life, I wonder whether I'll be able to sleep tonight after seeing this. It is THAT good.<br /><br />An intrepid Goth-girl-computer-hacker, Lizbeth Salander (exquisitely played by No'omi Rapace) becomes far too interested in a prominent journalist, Mikael (Michael Nyqvist), who gets sued for libel and sentenced to 3 months' jail time. He has a while before that sentence is to begin, and in that interim he is contacted by a benevolent old man. This man wants to find out what happened to his 'adopted' daughter (really his niece) - who vanished in the 1960s. The old man wants the journalist to discover what may have happened, and there is an immediately stated suspicion that this girl is dead.<br /><br />That much I leave there, but I have some observations about this. With all the undoubtedly over-hyped fuss regarding the recent British remake of this, and with the original novels, I can say I came blindly into this. Luckily I stumbled onto the DVD after having said "Pass" when it was on cable. Americans take, remake and just spoil the heck out of all these excellent films. Especially the Swedish ones. This series should have been left to the Swedes. I don't see any Brit or American dopes trying to remake CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON!<br /><br />This is an important film. The Goth girl, with a dragon tattoo that wreathes her entire body, is a new kind of superhero. She's been a victim but never 'played' the victim. She's gotten her revenge from the time she was a child. She has a photographic memory that is part of her arsenal and a set of cojones that made me green with envy. Her brains and investigative prowess made me greener. You will be stunned at the world's cruelty to her; you will be equally stunned by the strong message in this story: too many people hate women just for being women.<br /><br />There is much more in this rich, exciting film. Swedes are catching us up in America, and soon will be outdoing us on a regular basis. My feeling is they are only stopped by their economic woes. Once their money and political problems blow over, I hope to see hundreds of films as wonderful, chilling and educational as THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO. I look forward to seeing THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE ("Flickan som lekte med elden"), which holds the rest of Lizbeth's story - and the third film, THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST ("Luftslottet som spr&auml;ngdes"), all of which are 2009 Swedish films, shot back-to-back as one film.<br /><br />In the excellent extra on my DVD, No'omi talks about working on these films for over a year, doing nothing else during that time. Sadly, the DVD extras are extremely paltry.<br /><br />The latter two movies are, of course, also slated to be filmed and released in British versions, by way of Columbia Pictures. I'll live without those, thank you, having learnt my lesson long ago about these sub-par remakes.<br /><br />I have two good pieces of advice: watch this dubbed (it is excellent and there will be migraines galore if you try to follow subtitles); avoid the books if you have not read them (I believe in film as solid literature in and of itself). Also, be aware this is is NOT for the faint of heart and not for children. In my opinion, not even for teens.<br /><br />One star is deducted for all the far-too-realistic gruesomeness and the sex, which I found distracting, gratuitous and frankly weakening to the crime drama.</p></body></html>

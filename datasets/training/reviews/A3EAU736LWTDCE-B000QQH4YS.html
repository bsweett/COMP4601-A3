<meta name="summary" content="A Sci-Fi cop movie with a blood bath"></head><body><p>This is a classic movie. I have probably seen this movie enough times that I could recite at least 75% of it verbatim. I seen it back in the day when drive-ins where popular. I remember seeing the blood in this and being really drawn into the story. It is my favorite type of movie: A Revenge plot with lots of gore. Very violent and at times very funny. If you have been living under a rock for the last 15 years, then its time for you to go out and rent this or buy this. Oh and to the reviewer that said "I just couldn't deal with the violence" - please stick to Disney movies dude!</p></body></html>

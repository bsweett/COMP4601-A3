I don't know what the deal is with the sudden burst of negative reviews, but this is certainly NOT a bad movie.  I was in 7th grade when it came out and I remember how popular it was back then.  Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE loved it.  No one said they didn't like it.  Even my dad to this day says he wouldn't mind watching the movie a few more times, and he NEVER wants to watch a movie more than two times.<br /><br />The actors, the direction, the story EVERYTHING about this movie worked.  It's a movie that will remain a classic forever.  There's something here for everyone.</p></body></html>

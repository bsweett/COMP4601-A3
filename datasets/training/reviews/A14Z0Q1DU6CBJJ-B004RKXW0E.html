The shadows and the colors were unbelievable. Then, the toys came to life when the people weren't looking and I knew I was watching a gem of long lasting origin.<br /><br />It didn't take long for the brilliance of the animators and the writers to bring 'toys' to life, not only on screen, but in our minds and hearts. We could feel their plite. They had a seemingly simple life: be toys, love their owners and do whatever it took to continue to be Andy's toys. We can all relate. We've all had to get rid of toys, or replaced toys with new ones, or watched Mom put our favorite toys in a garage sale, or inevitably outgrew toys to the point that if we were still playing with them... we'd be made fun of.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 comes full circle and brings out emotions that I challenge any film out there with human actors to top. The toys are plain and simple... LOVE. That's their sole purpose in life. To Love and to be loved. A valuable lesson to all of us. So, as they once again try to find out a way to continue to be Andy's toys, Pixar not only duplicates the heart and soul of the first 2 movies, but surpasses. Somewhere along the line, the characters of Toy Story became real to us.<br /><br />As we all relate to reaching out for someone to love and to be loved in return, it's the toys soul purpose and that makes Toy Story 3 all the more poigniant. 5 stars doesn't give Toy Story 3 justice. It has it all. Where most movies are trying not to be a waste of time, TOY STORY 3 and its predecessor's will be timeless. Toy Story 3 will be nominated for best picture this year and it may even be the first animated film to win. It's that good.</p></body></html>

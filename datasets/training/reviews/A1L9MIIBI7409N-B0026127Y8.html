<meta name="summary" content="Liam Kicks Bond and Bourne's [...]"></head><body><p>This is a classic Luc Besson film - it's got his fingerprints all over it, even if he only co-wrote and produced it.  No-nonsense, gritty in-your-face action - old school torture and interrogation and subterfuge...this is the film that Quantum of Solace should have been!  Make Liam Neeson James Bond please.  But seriously, it's such a punchy thrill-a-minute film that it makes you almost long for a sequel.  Great direction by Pierre Morel (and a million times better than the dreadful "Transporter") - the only thing better than this was probably the original Nikita.  I'll say it again: SEQUEL!!<br /><br />The story was especially poignant because it involved family.  While watching this, I also couldn't help feeling sorry for Neeson - who just lost his wife.  RIP Natasha Richardson.<br /><br />Here's to Liam's future.  Great job.</p></body></html>

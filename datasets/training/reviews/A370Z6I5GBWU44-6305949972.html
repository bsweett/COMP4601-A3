<meta name="summary" content="Funky look at the holidays"></head><body><p>I have seen this movie several times and I never get tired of it. It gives a really funky look into the world of holidays, with a separate universe for each holiday that is connected to the real world. One day, Jack Skellington becomes curious about the other worlds, and goes from the Halloween world to the world of Christmas, where he is intrigued by it because it is so different from his own, so he wants to celebrate Christmas in the mortal world. This brings about disastrous consequences because he does not quite understand Christmas, and the other residents of the Halloween world understand it even less. The results are scary and hilarious, and this is a classic movie that never gets old.</p></body></html>

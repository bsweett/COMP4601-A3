<meta name="summary" content="just misses, still worth viewing"></head><body><p>The Prestige is an interesting film, buoyed more by the stars than the script.  I really enjoyed it; have viewed it several times, but I come away from the movie feeling like I've experienced a slight of hand, just like the magic they perform.  The wonderful, enduring Michael Caine - always a favourite who could lure me into watching him read a phone book -- gives a strong performance, as usual, as the magical engineer behind Hugh Jackman's Rufus Angier.  Jackman's beautiful, wonderful, so the movie's success rest heavily on his performance, and he does well in the lead.  Christian Bale as his rival is rather flat, but that could be the script more than his acting as Alfred Borden (but then, I always think this about his performances!).  And the White Lord Ziggy, David Bowie, puts in a guest spot that is interesting, but again a bit of waste of his talent.  Even a cameo from Daniel Davis.<br /><br />The movie centres around Jackman's Angier and Bale's Border.  Angier is the master showman.  He has the beauty and grace to set up a trick, which is more than half of it's success.  Border is more the thinking man's magician.  He can figure out his own tricks, but is lousy at presenting them, until rivalry pushes both men into obsession.  They were once friends, but after the death of Jackman's wife in the water tank trick, they became enemies, each trying to out do the other, and taking it way past a rivalry, unto nothing else really matters to them.  They lose friends, lovers, and ultimately rush to destruction - of themselves and each other.<br /><br />Very interesting film, one worth watching again.  But I still fill like the whole film is one big trick, just like the magic they perform.  Misdirection - great cast, beautifully filmed, but covering up what they don't want you too see, that it's a bit more flash than substance.</p></body></html>

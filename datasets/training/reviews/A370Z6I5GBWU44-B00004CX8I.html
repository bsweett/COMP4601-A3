I've seen plenty of movies that have been shoddy adaptations of books, but this movie was definitely not one of them. For those of you who have not read the book, the movie is clear enough on what it is about, requiring no previous knowledge of the book (unlike certain other movies, such as Harry Potter) and if you did read the book, I am sure you'll be happy to notice that the movie remains overall faithful, with the changes being minor. A bit has been cut out, but that's to be expected with book to movie adaptations.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson is an awesome actor, and he really embraced this role. While I imagined Randle Patrick McMurphy to be taller and stronger (and more Irish-looking), Jack had the right attitude for the role, so I can forgive the person in charge of casting. Everyone else also did a great job, especially Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched. Overall a wonderful movie, 4.5/5 stars.</p></body></html>

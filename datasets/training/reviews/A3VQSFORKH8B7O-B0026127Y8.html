<meta name="summary" content="AN EXCITING, FAST-PACED THRILLER!"></head><body><p>A word of advice: if you plan to kidnap a man's daughter in order to sell her into forced prostitution, make sure that the father is not a trained professional. Or else, he'll hunt you down and kill you. That is the primary storyline of "Taken," a fascinating, action-packed thrill ride about one man's search for his kidnapped daughter. Liam Neeson, one of our greatest actors, proves his action mettle, taking out one thug after another, while also showing tender love for his daughter, the reason he goes on a rampage. There's some great action sequences, fine storytelling and a fine supporting cast. Fans of action-thrillers will find much to enjoy in "Taken!"<br />Movie/DVD Grade: A</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Back to Back To The Future"></head><body><p>Finally, Universal have decided to release the long awaited DVD Boxset of the most exciting trilogy ever released since Star Wars. Back To The Future has got to be one of our modern day classics. A big piece of pop culture. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd will always be remembered for their roles as Marty McFly and Dr. Emmet Brown.<p>This special boxset features many extras that are compiled for each part on seperate discs, including deleted scenes, a behind the scenes look at the making of Back To The Future and its sequels, bloopers (which are remarkably funny), commentary and interview with Michael J Fox, public service announcements for the fight against Parkinson's which features Michael J Fox along with Muhammed Ali, and much much more!<p>The audio quality is perfect, and the video is crisp clear. Of course, what did you expect?<p>This is one boxset that is definitely a keeper.<p>Go out, buy it, watch over and over again, and join Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd on Robert Zemeckis' and Steven Speilberg's ride as they take you 'Back To The Future'</p></body></html>

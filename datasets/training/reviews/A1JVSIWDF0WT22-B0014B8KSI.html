<meta name="summary" content="NOMINATED FOR BEST PICTURE AND DESERVEDLY SO !"></head><body><p>For the first half hour of this picture I spent my time trying to understand just what was going on and fighting off falling sleep, good thing I succeeded as Michael Clayton turned out to be one of the best pictures of 2007. It reminded me a little bit of "The Firm" which I've watched a bunch of times. George Clooney is in his best role ever and things turn out to be very different than they appeared early in the movie. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not the average monster running amok story"></head><body><p>The Host is an unlikely horror film that combines various elements that are generally not found in a horror film, love for the family, environment, critique on governmental policy, American military presence in South Korea, dark humor. All these elements were successfully incorporated in the film and that was what made it interesting to me.<br />The buildup is slow but then you have the finest destruction scene in recent years. I gave this scene a high mark because the monster does not get to topple any famous landmarks instead it rushes after people and you get to observe the emotions which are a combination of fear and helplessness on their faces in this chaos.  The news breaks to the media and the military is called to help provide medical care and then quarantine the citizens. You have the introduction to the characters who will be protagonists, a child like adult (Song Kang Ho ) his sister who is a archer, and brother who is educated but unemployed. This family gets together and goes in search of the monster.<br />One may think that this is a monster movie but in reality this movie is about family and turning to their help when everything else has failed.  The action scenes and the story line riveting. I liked this movie 3 stars 6/13/10</p></body></html>

Sure, we can all haggle over history (or legend, as the case may be) but what this film boils down to is that it is an action yarn that's littered with historical and legendary tidbits about one of the greatest legends of our time, King Arthur.  Clive Owen takes up Excalibur as our hero this time, and he leads a group of Samatian knights against the Woads and then the Saxons to set his people free.  Galahad, Tristan, Gawain and others ride with Arthur and face death with not even the slightest bit of fear.  In this version, Guinevere and Lancelot only flirt for a minute, so don't expect the love triangle that was key to so many of the other versions of this great epic.<br /><br />The cast is excellent, including Ioann Gruffudd (Fantastic Four, Horatio Hornblower), Hugh Dancy (Ella Enchanted, Blood and Chocolate), Ray Stephenson (HBO's "Rome"), Ray Winstone (Cold Mountain, Beowulf), Stellan Skarsgard (Deep Blue Sea, Amistad, Pirates of the Caribbean), and Til Schweiger (SLC Punk!, Joe and Max).  Fans of Jerry Bruckheimer productions will notice plenty of the actors involved in this film.  The music, by Hans Zimmer, is some of his most epic yet.<br /><br />Director Antoine Fuqua does an excellent job of melding plot and action in this tale.  Writer David Franzoni litters the story with just enough legend to remind you that Arthur may or may not have been just that.  Some of the characters, especially knights such as Tristan, Dagonet and Bors, are given lighter treatment than you'd expect, but maybe that's why this tale is called "King Arthur" and not "Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table."<br /><br />The DVD is very nice.  It features two very informative mini-documentaries on the making of the film.  The first is "Blood On The Land" which gives you an inside look at the making of the film.  The other is "Round Table," which features a literal round table with some of the cast and key members of the production.  There's also the optional "Knight Vision," which offers all sorts of trivia about the actual time and place these events might have taken place in.<br /><br />Granted, historians and armchair historians will argue over this film's accuracy until the cows come home.  In the end, though, this film is nothing more than an epic along the lines of "Gladiator."  I highly recommend "King Arthur" as well as two other Arthurian films, those being "Excalibur" and the musical "Camelot."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The movie needed more about the killer and the other victim..."></head><body><p>Sean Penn does a fine job impersonating the assassinated San Francisco politician Harvey Milk here, but the film itself is less than perfect. I needed a bit less of the gay personal relations drama, and a bit more about Mayor George Moscone, who was also killed, and Dan White, the emotionally disturbed fellow city supervisor who shot both men. Moscone is almost totally absent from the movie, but in my recollection of the events, he was as  important an irritant in Dan White's mental crisis as Milk. And White's decision to go to City Hall with a pistol that day is not presented coherently here. I don't care much for Penn's radical politics or apparently real-life personality, but it is hard to deny his talents. And Mr. Milk, by most accounts, had courage and political integrity, and did not deserve his fate any more than Moscone did. In this version of the events, Milk's political rise is much more interesting than his personal life. A question that has not been answered fully is which part of Milk's life was, to Dan White, a more compelling reason to shoot him too?</p></body></html>

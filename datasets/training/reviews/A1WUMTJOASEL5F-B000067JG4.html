I first saw this movie when it premiered in "Cineramascope" on the cinerama sceen, and it is the most memorable movie of that fad era, because that is the way it was meant to be viewed, and should be watched. I am so glad home theater sceens are accomodating those vibrant additives to give todays audience a chance to see how some of these movies worked. It was absolutely incredible to recall the giant size visions of the convent interiors, and deluxe "mountainous" scenery. The sights of seeing our beloved Julie dance, hop, skip, and jump throughout the movie with seven, (yes, seven), children next to her heels is a must see. I am not much of a complainer for intricate drivel or criticism, as long as the general feel of the movie produced is well worth the size of entertainment it gives in no uncertain terms. (This includes low-budget theater).<br />On another note, the available soundtrack to The Sound Of Music is pretty much a necessity if one is to grasp the stereo scope of the music output. It gives another dimension to relate to the magnificence of this feature. And the cover photo of this product says it all!</p></body></html>

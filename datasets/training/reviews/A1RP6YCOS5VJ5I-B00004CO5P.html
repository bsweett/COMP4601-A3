It is such a moving story, it brings tears to my eyes everytime.<br /><br />What an all-star cast! Matthew Broderick, Carey Elwes, Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman and the list goes on and on. These incredible actors bring their best and carry the film all the way through. Elwes isn't even American and he makes a convincing American soldier, a great actor indeed. It proves that this story is more than American history, but human history. A must see film for every single person, and no one will be disappointed.</p></body></html>

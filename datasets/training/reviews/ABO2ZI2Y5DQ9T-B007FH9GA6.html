<meta name="summary" content="Hollywood Adaptation as Good as Swedish Counterpart"></head><body><p>"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is a Hollywood adaptation of Swedish writer Stieg Larsson's mystery novel. The film, of which story is dark and often violent, is directed by David Fincher, who is known for such thriller as "Se7en" and "Zodiac."<br /><br />The film is about a Swedish journalist and co-owner of the magazine "Millennium" Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), who, after losing a libel case brought against him, sets out to investigate what happened to Harriet Vanger, grandniece of Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), a retired CEO of a family industry, when she suddenly went missing about 40 years ago.<br /><br />To do so, he enlists a help from a genius computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), who has gone through terrible experiences as you will see in the film. "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is more about the luridness of the truths than the process of finding them out, and about the characters who can be very brutal without remorse.<br /><br />Considering the subject matter, David Fincher is the right choice for making an English-speaking version, though it seems as if the director has lost interest in the film's final 20 minutes or so.<br /><br />Some nay find the film's English-speaking characters (played by the international cast) in the Swedish setting a bit strange. But perhaps the film would have looked stranger had its story been set in somewhere in America. After all remaking a film is not copying the original, but changing it, so something must go.<br /><br />With Jeff Cronenweth's effective photography, Fincher's version looks more polished than the Swedish counterpart, though I don't know if it is really a good thing. The 158 minute film is most notable for Rooney Mara's strong acting and director's skills that keep the sinister feeling going on in the film's world.</p></body></html>

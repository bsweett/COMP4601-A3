The acting is pretty terrible and the plot is stupid.  If you like watching people shoot flesh-eating zombies with a lot of blood and gore, this is for you.  But, other than that, there is simply nothing to this movie...this is just not enough to keep my interest.  So, if you're looking for a real horror movie or dare I say "scary movie", don't even think about watching this garbage.</p></body></html>

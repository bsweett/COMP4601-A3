<meta name="summary" content="Classic"></head><body><p>This is an absolute thriller of a movie.<br /><br />The black and white film had a type of erie feeling to it.<br /><br />I saw this film when i was about 13,and it scared me at the time but i was in awe of such a well constructed movie.<br /><br />The movie starts off kinda boring as this lady finds a hotel room,and if you didnt know what was about to happen you might concider turning it off.<br /><br />However when she enters the shower all hell breaks loose and that realy scary music scares hell outa me each time i see it.<br /><br />That mansion is as spooky as anything,and they sure dont make horror movies like this anymore.<br /><br />The part when the sister goes up the stairs to see mother,makes me crap myself.<br /><br />This is a damn good movie,and probably the best horror movie around.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I Love This Movie"></head><body><p>I think the title of this review says it all, but this is truly a spectacular movie. In retrospect, it's like a guns version of the Johnny Depp movie "Blow."<br /><br />Actually in more ways than one. Both films are about men who begin working in illegal businesses while making vast sums of money and watching their dream come true; And then watch their lives crumble around them with time. Also both films received good reviews and featured Oscar worthy performances and scripts but were ignored by the Academy. Nicolas Cage takes a break from playing his loser character (Matchstick Men, The Weather Man, etc.) and instead plays Yuri Orlov, a Ukrainian man who was raised in Brooklyn. Yuri realizes one day that doing what he's been doing isn't working for him, so with the help of his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto, 'Requiem for a Dream') he becomes a private gunrunner delivering to people in places like Sierra Leone, Russia, and Liberia. Meanwhile, Yuri also marries his dream girl Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan, who looks completely different then she did in the movies 'The Recruit' and 'I, Robot') and has a son. The movie says at the end "Based on Real Events," which means nothing...I doubt that a man named Yuri Orlov existed but that doesn't make this film any more or less interesting. Writer/Director Andrew Niccol paints a near perfect portrait of a troubled, yet brilliant man who's trying to support his family and make money no matter who or what he risks. This is one of Nicolas Cage's best performances since "Leaving Las Vegas." Both Eathan Hawke (That dude who was married to Uma Thurman) and Ian Holm ('From Hell') deliver good supporting work; Especially Hawke who plays an Interpol agent chasing Yuri for years and never truly getting what he wants. The movie presents a great message, something young viewers won't notice sadly enough. This is not only one of the most morally terrific movies of 2005, but it was also one of the best and most overlooked. If you haven't seen this movie, then just do it.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Movie That Made Arnold, Arnold"></head><body><p>THE TERMINATOR has become a classic; an iconic piece of movie history.  This is the movie that made the Govenator a star.  Part sci-fi time travel drama, part blood and guts shoot `em up, part action-adventure, THE TERMINATOR stands the test of time and remains a favorite in the hearts of its fans.<br /><br />Arnold Schwarzenegger became a household name playing THE TERMINATOR, a killer cyborg from the future whose sole mission is to kill Sarah Connor.  His performance as the merciless, unstoppable killer is chilling.  This is the first movie in which he wore clothes for the majority of the film, and where he uttered what is arguably his most famous line "I'll be back." (Admittedly, he only had 18 lines!) Linda Hamilton is terrific as Sarah Connor, a young woman who is stronger than she thinks and is able to overcome incalculable odds.  The special effects are excellent, especially for 1984, and they still look great today.<br /><br />I just plain like this movie.  I remember seeing it in the theatres in 1984, and being blown away.  And I still enjoy it after all these years.  I showed THE TERMINATOR to my 12 year old daughter a few days ago, and she thought that it was "pretty cool," too.  High praise coming from a tween!</p></body></html>

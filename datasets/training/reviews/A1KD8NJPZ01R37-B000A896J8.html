BUT, Orlando probably wasn't the best choice for the role, and the story is just so bland. Liam Neeson is in it for a whopping 90 seconds.<br /><br />Your thinking "Ridley Scott; it's got to be awesome". But alas they gave him a budget for good production value but the rest just sucks. It's definitely worth a look, and good for some mindless action, but you'll have buyers remorse if you purchase.</p></body></html>

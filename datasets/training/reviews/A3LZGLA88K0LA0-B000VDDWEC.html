<meta name="summary" content="JOLLY OLE ENGLAND?"></head><body><p>Although there are certainly some tense moments and a few really disquieting scenes, Danny Boyle's 28 HOURS LATER loses something in the end.  Some of the camera work and imaginative editing are really effective; the acting overall is good.  Naomie Harris and Cillian Murphy are very durable in their leading roles; Brendan Glesson and Megan Burns lend fine support as Frank and Hannah.  The movie loses its steam once it hits the soldiers camp and the typical, cliche characters perform in their expected macho madness.  By the time the film reaches it's all too predictable ending, one feels a little left out.  Many reviewers said that this film is not a &quot;horror&quot; film; than shame on 20th Century Fox for marketing as the scariest movie ever made.<br />On the DVD, the deleted scenes show they should have been, and the three alternate endings are worthless, too.  The third one is nothing more than the storyboard with overacting hamminess from director Boyle and screenwriter Gardner.<br />The movie does have a message, but as far as really frightening, it only has it's moments.<br />RECOMMENDED WITH RESERVATIONS.</p></body></html>

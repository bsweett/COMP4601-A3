The sense of duty, of loyalty,  and of staying where you need to be, regardless of your own feelings, is  what makes this story stand out and shine. &quot;English Patient&quot; and  films with a similar plot can never match up to  this.<p>&quot;Casablanca&quot; is a French city in the middle of the  Middle-Eastern desert, now overrun with Nazis. Humphrey Bogart plays Rick  Blaine, the cynical owner of Casablanca's best-known bar. The only person  who knows anything real about Rick is the piano player, Sam (known for the  immortal lines &quot;Sam, I thought I told you never to play...&quot; and  &quot;Play it again, Sam&quot;) who was present in Paris long ago when  Rick's heart was broken.<p>Years ago, Rick fell in love with a beautiful  woman named Ilse in Paris, who vanished when the Germans invaded. Now she's  back with her husband--Victor Laszlo, a patriot who works for the  underground. Rick is (not surprisingly) angry, even though he still loves  Ilse, and she still loves him.<p>Bogart and Bergman exude excellent  chemistry--you can feel their pain and love. The cast is also blessed by  wonderful secondary characters, such as Sam, who seems to feel sorry for  Rick and Ilse; and Captain Louis Renault, a lovably amoral French official.  There's also a slimy little conman named Ugarte, and a slimy big  casino-owner named Renault, both of whom sell fake exit visas (these  characters, as well as Bogart, can be found in the &quot;Maltese  Falcon,&quot; so watch for them)<p>Rick is a great man: He's hardened and  cynical, but as we watch, he helps people who have nothing for themselves,  and gives away his own happiness. The script also gives him many of the  wonderful lines: when little rat Ugarte asks, &quot;You despise me, don't  you?&quot;, Rick's only reply is, &quot;If I gave you any thought I  probably would.&quot; <p>Though this is rated PG, most kids will be bored  silly by it--there's a lot of talking and angst and romance. Also, there's  one scene where a Bulgarian girl delicately hints at prostitution, but  anyone younger than their teens probably wouldn't pick it up (she only  refers to it as a &quot;bad thing&quot;).<p>The sets are beautiful and  harsh, as harsh as Rick sees the world. The last scene is perhaps one of  the most famous in movie history. Like Audrey Hepburn's &quot;Roman  Holiday,&quot; the realistic and mature approach to difficult situations  are what make this story special. One of the best romances ever  filmed.<p>&quot;Here's looking at you, kid.&quot;</p></body></html>

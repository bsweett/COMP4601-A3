The Stephen King seal of approval didn't help.  Now I can see why King calls this the best horror film in twenty years.  Not as a knock on the film, it plays like a middle school version of "Carrie".  Director Matt Reeves expertly establishes time and place by placing the film in 1983 snow-swept Los Alamos, New Mexico.  This creates a claustrophobic feeling that enhances the fright factor.  He's ably abetted by the terrific performances of his juvenile leads, Kodi Smit-McPhee as the tormented young boy and Chloe Grace Moretz as the ageless vampire trapped in a twelve year old girl's body.  Smit-McPhee and Moretz, belying their years, make the love between their characters palpable and believable.  You'll shed a tear from time to time even if one of the lovers would rather cut your throat than embrace you.  I find it interesting that Reeves juxtaposes their relationship with that of Romeo and Juliet.  It's kind of an apt one that would almost portend doom for the most unlikely pairing.  "Let Me In" caught me completely by surprise and is easily one of the best sleepers of 2010.</p></body></html>

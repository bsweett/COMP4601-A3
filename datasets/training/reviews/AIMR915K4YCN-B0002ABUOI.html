She is unaware that the world around her is changing in ways that will soon shatter everything she knows, believes, hopes, or dreams. Ana goes to bed with her husband, oblivious to the growing horror and creeping dread right outside. In the morning, Ana faces the new reality first hand. She has no time to adjust or think, only to flee, to react, and to survive. Yes, the dead run the streets, seeking prey, seeking those like Ana to attack and slaughter. Ana's once quiet neighborhood is a battlezone. Her entire life has suddenly plummeted off the cliff of normality into the darkness of unknown terror. Ana runs, screams, and drives on instinct now. She is automatically moving, trying to escape. Trying to keep away from the hordes of former humans that pursue her. The fires burn and the helicopters roar overhead. Ana has entered the end of all things. Somehow, she meets up with other survivors. Kenneth (Ving Rhames) is a cop who comes across Ana's wrecked car. They walk together now, strangers in a nightmare land of roaming cannibals and panic. The two find another small group of warm-blooded people. Can this tiny group stay alive? Can they face what is unthinkable? Do what is inconcievable? DAWN OF THE DEAD is a masterpiece of dread and lurking fear. The situations are fast, violent, and shocking. The characters are living people with pasts that no longer matter. The story is apocalyptic to the extreme, slamming home the idea of a world devoid of all but death, and those who seek to outlast it. Buy this movie immediately! It's like Fulci's ZOMBIE, Romero's NIGHT-DAWN-DAY OF THE DEAD, THE STAND, and MESSIAH OF EVIL all rolled into one gnashing, biting, drooling package! What are you waiting for?? ...</p></body></html>

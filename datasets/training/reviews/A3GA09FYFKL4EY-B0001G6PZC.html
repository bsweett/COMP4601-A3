Filled with thrilling battle scenes, fabulous cinematography, and the rich culture of ancient Japan, "Last Samurai" delivers on every level. Cruise's background and personal torment are glossed over a bit - this could have been explored more, and his romance with the widow of the warrior he defeats in battle is left unresolved, but this is a great adventure story. Highly recommend!</p></body></html>

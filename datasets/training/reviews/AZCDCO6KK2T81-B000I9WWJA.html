<meta name="summary" content="Inside Man Thinks Outside of the Box!"></head><body><p>This is one of those films where you can't discuss too much of the plot without giving away the whole store.  This film is filled with interesting plot twists, mystery, suspense, sure-footed direction by Spike Lee, and well-acted by all involved.  I've always liked Lee's films, but this is his first truly "mainstream" film that all can enjoy.  I can't help but feel that Lee is winking at his critics with this film, "See I can do this kind of stuff.  That's IF I want to."<br /><br />This perfectly casted film is a great diversion that I think most will enjoy.  I rented it, then I ran out to buy it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The best Acting I've seen on screen"></head><body><p>A movie completely worth of watching should have this one key element - A powerful performance, one where the actor(or actress) truly becomes that character, or in some cases like in "Ray", a real person.<br />Jamie Foxx took this project on with great gusto, and what an amazing achievement it is! I often forgot i was watching a movie and really thought it was the Real Ray.<br />I want to make the movie loving public highly aware just how much RAY truly deserves viewing time.<br />Be prepared for a truly amazing feat - Jamie Foxx is Ray Charles! Ray Charles was a very hip, cool pioneer of music.<br />This biographic film version doesn't sugarcoat his life in any way. You see it all here -- why he went blind, what his childhood was like, how he got into music and set off on a whirlwind trip into the musical future he had. Drugs, sex, and Ray Charles' music - Not sure how to classify it, very jazzy/bluesy feeling, and maybe a smidge of country. It's filmed in many flashbacks in his life, as it tries to piece together how his life was mapped out.<br /><br />I didn't see a lot of the films from 2004 nor have I seen many of the Oscar nominees. Ray is the first of that kind. But I will not forget it, and I will watch it many times as I own the DVD.<br />You will learn, be amazed, and be blown away! Watch Ray!<br /><br />Eileen F.</p></body></html>

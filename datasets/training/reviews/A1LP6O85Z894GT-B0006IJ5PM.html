<meta name="summary" content="A fine film about life"></head><body><p>First things first. Please read Bissinger's superb piece of personal journalism that inspired this film. It will help fill in the historical, political, racial and societal gaps that the film medium is not always able to communicate in a two hour running time.<br /><br />That said, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is an honest and emotional journey throught the obsessiveness that permeates every pore of a small Texas town. The point of religious zealotry is of course, in this instance, High School football.<br /><br />Director Peter Berg (Bissinger's cousin in fact) wisely chooses to shoot the film in a documentary fashion in an effort to capture the original book's journalistic viewpoint. For viewers used to the straight ahead approach conventionally employed by the sports film genre, this might be somewhat off putting. Berg often employ's hand held shots that swish and pan through the scene, providing long takes that capture the immediacy of the characters' lives and environments. This film making choice allows the actors to inhabit their roles truthfully without feeling the need to grandize.<br /><br />On the note of acting, all the performers give naturalistic, low-key performances. There is nary a false note. Anchored by Billy Bob Thorton's understated work as head coach Gary Gaines, the ensemble cast avoids "star" performances and creates a meaningful ensemble. Again, Berg's cinema-verite' camera draws the viewer into the characters' lives and invites the actors to embrace the genuine truth of each organic moment. Like any good documentary, there are many scenes where the viewer feels uncomfortable and like an intruder on someone else's private moment. The heart rendering scenes between Tim McGraw (making a stunning debut here) and his son, being just one instance.<br /><br />The echoing, and haunting score by Explosions in the Sky evokes the painful loneliness that awaits each high school athlete after the cheering ends and the stadium empties and all that awaits is the vast, vacuous Texas prarie night.<br /><br />Berg avoids many of the tried and true cliche's that dominate so many sports films. There is no uplifting training sequence. There is no obligatory scene of team bonding (usuall the team lip syncing to a Motown classic in the shower). The big game is an ultimate let down (not a spoiler for anyone who has read the book).<br /><br />The action scenes of the football games themselves are brutal. Berg never lets the audience forget that these games are violent rituals, creating a communal substitution for nothing less than war.<br /><br />The film is not without its flaws. It's attention to period detail is negligible (come on, where are all the "mullets"?)and it doesn't approach the scope of the book's superb social commentary (there are historic, economic and political reasons High School Football has such prominence). I also missed the portrayl of the special treatment the athletes received in school. This was (and still IS in many instances) an era where the definition of "student/athlete" was nebulous.<br /><br />The DVD's deleted scenes do provide some of the social commentary though and a behind the scenes documentary places real faces and voices to the characters' on screen life. To see what followed the events depicted in the film reminds the viewer that life does not end once the pads are put away.<br /><br />Like Bissinger's book, Berg's film resounds with a underlying sadness. These young boys may be warriors once, but they are always replacable and interchangeable. They are plaques and tiles always ready to be tossed into the trash in favor of next year's batch. These young men often face careers of "what could have been" and "used to be's". But for a brief and shining moment, they held court and came to life under the brilliant hope of FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.</p></body></html>

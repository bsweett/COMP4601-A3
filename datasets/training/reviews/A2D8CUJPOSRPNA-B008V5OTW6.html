<meta name="summary" content="What Price Vengeance?"></head><body><p>Steven Spielberg has often been the focus of a lot of criticism throughout a career of blockbusters and Oscar-winning films like SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but I don't think the criticism has been as intense towards him as it has been to MUNICH.  Here he is, taking on the subjects of terrorism and vengeance--and there are all these people, condemning him not only for doing it, but for the very way he's doing it.  Why is this?<br /><br />Well, for one thing, he takes as his starting point the murder of eleven Israeli athletes by Black September terrorists at the Olympic Games in Munich on September 5, 1972, and how Israel responded to it.  The Israeli agents, led by a devout Jew (Eric Bana), are assigned to go after the eleven Palestinian masterminds behind the Munich massacre and kill them.  But the more these agents kill, the more they realize that their actions are not only leading to more bloodshed, they themselves are not just the hunters but also, in many respects, the hunted.  For every terrorist, whether actual or supposed, that they assassinate, one more pops up somewhere around the world.<br /><br />This last point is the point that Spielberg is the most intent on making clear--vengeance is only so good up to a point, and then one must ask, at what price?  It is the kind of ambiguity that is rife in the real world, and a lot of people with very fanatical views don't want to be confronted with that kind of reality, and particularly not in America after the 9/11 attacks.  Contrary to what its detractors would say, Spielberg never condemns Israel for its post-Munich actions--NOT ONCE.  But he is asking some straightforward questions about what the costs are for mere vengeance, not only in human lives, but also, and most especially, in human souls, be they Jewish or Arab.  The film's final shot, across the Hudson River to the twin towers of the World Trade Center is Spielberg's way of saying that now the issue of the cost of vengeance applies to his own country as well.<br /><br />Although a very long film at close to two hours and 45 minutes, MUNICH still moves with lightning precision, tension, and documentary-like camerawork, utilizing television footage from the actual events at Munich, and describing how the operations of Bana's team are often carried out on the fly and with always bloody, and sometimes imperfect results.  This is definitely NOT the kind of us-versus-them film that the American far-right likes, but it's the way the real world often works, and it's the way Spielberg sees it.  All of his skills as a director are put to the fullest possible use to make MUNICH yet another feather in his cap as Hollywood's premiere prestige filmmaker.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="suspension of disbelief"></head><body><p>"Nowadays" between New York and Los Angeles. A climatologist (Dennis Quaid) needs to find a way to save "the world" from global warming. His son (Jake Gyllenhaal) is hiding with a group of friends in the New York Public Library and is experiencing first-hand the major weather changes.<br /><br />Special effects were all wonderful. I was only disappointed in the wolves: they did not look real at all.<br /><br />Keep in mind when watching this movie that it requires a *lot* of suspension of disbelief. Most of what happens is beyond belief and rather predictable.<br /><br />That said, it is still enjoyable entertainment, and Dennis Quaid proves that he is an excellent actor. Gyllenhaal is not the best, but the casting was decent enough for this movie.<br /><br />Pure Hollywood entertainment. What else can one expect from a director like Roland Emmerich.</p></body></html>

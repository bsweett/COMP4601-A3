<meta name="summary" content="4.75 STARS: Stylish & unique horror flick with amazing use of a dreamlike atmosphere to effectuate horror.."></head><body><p>When I first read the reviews about "Suspiria", I knew that I had to watch it.  Many of the reviews are quite right about this flick as it is quite stylish and definitely unique.  Argento does a terrific job presenting the audience with a different kind of horror that is largely based on atmosphere and the supernatural element of pure evil.  With a creepy soundtrack, loud colors and an eerily weird storyline/plot, "Suspiria" delivers a solid horror viewing experience.<br /><br />As many have suggested, Argento's plot are rather thin and poorly developed.  Argento seems to play on the strange storyline and the audience sees a lot of flamboyance and stylish scenes that sometimes don't make a lot of sense.  Indeed, it is somewhat hard to follow, but that is part of Argento's genius that his plots are always overshadowed by stylish scenes and an eerie atmosphere, yet his movies are still effective at producing horror.<br /><br />The color used in "Suspiria" is so wild and flamboyant, the viewer becomes mesmerized in the dark world that is "Suspiria".  The basic plot involves a young American woman who has travelled abroad to enroll in a ballet dancing school.  However, this is no ordinary dance studio, in fact, this is a witches's coven with a very dark and sinister character.<br /><br />***BEWARE SPOILERS*** (read this part after viewing the movie)<br /><br />The beginning of "Suspiria" is quite scary as the audience observes a couple of the most graphic and horrifying death scenes in the history of horror cinema.  This scene is very scary and disturbing to some as this young lady is brutally murdered.  Unlike many directors and modern horror movies alike, Argento always succeeds as using blood and gore as an incidental mechanism to increase horror in the audience, and not as his only means of producing horror.  In other words, Argento does not use blood and gore as his only vehicle to create horror, but it is the setting, suspense, the situation, the story and the horrifying atmosphere that Argento employs that are actually scary.  Consequently, the killing in and of itself is a lot scarier in this movie than it would be without the dreamlike atmosphere and tension build-up that Argento uses to effectuate horror.  Therefore, when the violence, blood and gore actually occur, there is already a foundation for the horror upon which the kill scenes work to magnify and/or accentuate, solidify and finalize such horror.  A perfect example of this would be the bathroom scene towards the beginning of the movie when a girl is killed by a witch or some creature as it came through the bathroom window.  This scene in "Suspiria" is a perfect example of how Argento presents a horrifying death scene that was preceded by building tension, ascending atmosphere, and horrifying suspense.<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />From this point, the movie centers on the experiences of the young American lady named Suzy Banyon, who eventually becomes quite suspicious of the "goings on" of this dance school.  After a friend of Suzy disappears, Suzy becomes determined to find out what is going on behind the scenes of this dance school.  Ultimately, Suzy discovers a world of evil, darkness and horror that she could not have possibly imagined.  The ending is very good when Suzy confronts the master or head witch and realizes the sinister nature that lies within the walls of the so called dance academy.<br /><br />In general, the acting is pretty good although I thought Jessica Harper's was dubiously adequate at times.  The directing is very good, especially at presenting a unique and horrifying atmospheric experience for the audience.  Argento's scary mixture of a dreamlike and nightmare-like atmosphere is very effective at creating a solid basis from which horror can be derived.  The make-up, special effects and gore are very good for a flick made in the 1970's, and even now, remains unrivaled to a large degree.<br /><br />Argento's "Suspiria" is not for everyone and only die-hard horror movie fans like myself will be able to appreciate its brilliance.  That being said, there is no question that Argento's stress on style in "Suspiria" overshadows a weakly developed and poorly structured plot.  However, strangely enough, this is part of Suspiria's charm.  In fact, one could argue that the audience is thrown into a world of chaos in "Suspiria" and that this chaos in and of itself produces more horror than something that supposedly "makes sense".<br /><br />Watching "Suspiria" is like being hypnotized by a beautiful yet horrifying nightmare.  In short, "Suspiria" is one of the best flicks the horror movie genre has to offer and is a must own for all serious horror movie lovers.  Like a fine wine, "Suspiria" gets better and better with age and after repeated viewings.  I highly recommend "Suspiria" as one of the scariest movies ever made.</p></body></html>

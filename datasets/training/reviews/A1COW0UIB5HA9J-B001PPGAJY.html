<meta name="summary" content="Masterful sequel that soars high on High-Def!"></head><body><p>A year after the couragous mutant team known as the X-Men, there has been a terrorist mutant attack made by Devil-esque mutant named Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) in the White House. Rouge (Anna Paquin) and Bobby Drake a.k.a. Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) seem to be having a beautiful relationship together and Logan a.k.a. Wolverine (Huge Jackman) is still struggling to discover his true past and to find out on something on a man named William Stryker (Brian Cox) who made his adamantium skeleton and claws, now after the threat at the white-house it seems humans seem to hate mutants more. Now Stryker has terrorized the X-men mansion and kidnaps some of the mutant students including Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) himself so he can learn the secrets of the computer Cerebro so that Stryker can make a version of Cerebro himself to harm all mutants. Now it's up to Cyclops (James Marsden), Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Storm (Halle Berry) and now teamed up with Magneto (Ian Mckellen) and Mystique (Rebecca Romjin) to try to save both humanity and mutants alike from this new menace.<br /><br />A sequel that surpasses on a great original but makes it better. This movie features more mutants such as Lady DeathStrike (Kelly Hu), Pyro (Aaron Standford), Kitty Pryde (Katie Stuart) and of course Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler. Bryan Singer returns as producer, story writer and director as he reunites with Marvel Films after collabrating on the great original for it's more longer, more action packed and more cerebral then the first movie. Here this movie knows how to surpass the original with more psychological and more allegory on racism like the original on how to be accepted as a different person, it's an emotional funny and thrilling ride that i recommend.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray offers the movie in beautiful HD including some outstanding sound as the extras include audio commentaries, featurettes, pre-production featurettes, deleted scenes, documentary on behind the scenes of this extraordinary sequel, still galleries and trailers.</p></body></html>

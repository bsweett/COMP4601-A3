Be forewarned, there's a naked wrestling scene and if you dare to watch it, it'll be singed into your memory forever (that's not a good thing). Despite this prompt to heed possible visual doom, I must say I laughed so much I missed some dialogue and had to watch the movie again. Sacha Baron Cohen definitely makes a lasting impression on viewers and has accumulated a strange cult following. Will you ever be the same after watching this movie - probably not. I can only compare the need to view this film to a UFO sighting; curiosity will urge us to look even at the risk of long term, mind altering effects!<br /><br />Chrissy K.

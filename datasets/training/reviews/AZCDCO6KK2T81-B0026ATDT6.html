This ambitious work misses its mark by a few yards rather than a mile.<br /><br />I had read many glowing reviews for this film and I sincerely wanted to like it, but this film is such a diverse mixed bag that it just doesn't work for me.  While the comedic elements are hysterically funny, they seems far too slapstick and way out of place in this kind of film and it doesn't matter if the film is meant to be campy or not.  The satirical components of the film are just too strong when subtly would have had more of an impact.  The dramatic scenes lose their potency amid the humor and satire.  There are times when this kind of juxapositioning can work well, but this film's writer and director just aren't that polished to pull off this complex and ambitious goal of making us laugh and feel a sense of tragedy at the same time.<br /><br />The film's actors are okay, but nothing really memorable except the elder father who is completely likable in his role.  The effects are above average, but the creature is a bit funny looking.  I mean, I actually giggled at it.  It looked something like what would occur if a giant squid got it on with a steroid infected piranha somehow.  Needless to say it never came close to scaring me as much as the shark in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008KLVG4">Jaws</a> did in which this picture claims to be on par.  That was a poor marketing stragedy as very very few "us against it" films ever reach the "Jaws" level of filmmaking.<br /><br />Overall, this film was interesting if for no other reason than it tries to be different and attempts to include more and not less and that is a worthy goal; however, "more" should be attempted by those with more skill and finesse than those who made this effort.</p></body></html>

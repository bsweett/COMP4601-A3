Campbell does a deadly accurate impersonation of THE KING, making the viewer feel as though it might be possible that the Presley is alive somewhere in a nursing home in Texas. Legendary acting veteran Ossie Davis, known mostly for his dramatic roles, jumps headlong into his part as a resident that believes that he is JFK. Before the movie ends, you'll be thinking it, too.<br /><br />While the sfx and monster makeup were obviously shot on a shoestring budget, the exemplary script and dialog make up for the former shortcomings. <p>And the slight, but oh-so-recognizable &quot;jabs&quot; at the bigger budgeted &quot;The Mummy&quot; are quite entertaining. <p>This is &quot;B-movie&quot; that deserves an &quot;A&quot; for ingenuity and originality.<br />.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining, but nothing new"></head><body><p>This film was entertaining, but didn't cover any new ground.  It was nice to see the familiar characters up to their usual antics, but the story was a bit thin and was probably the reason the movie was so short.<br /><br />It's really a cable movie that's good for a few laughs.</p></body></html>

Day-Lewis' resonant voice is a potent magnet. It evokes the deceptively dulcet tones of John Huston in Chinatown, charm slathered over wolfish perversity, the better to cheat you with, my dear." Peter Travers<br /><br />In the first few minutes after the final moments of this film, I sat in silence. I felt like I had been punched in the belly, the impact of this film and the performance by Daniel Day-Lewis is monumental. Daniel Plainview, is a man who was scratching for a living in the beginning of teh 1900's. He scratched for silver at first and developed a bum leg after falling down a mine. He moved on to oil and after striking an oil well he moved on to become an oil tycoon. At this time he adopted a young boy he named HW. This boy became the love of Plainview's life, and the only tender moments we see are with HW. Plainview's nemesis is Eli Sunday, a preacher in the Evangelical mode. He and Plainview get under each other's skin, and the true embarrassments in life that both feel occur because of the other. Each of them are preaching a sermon the other has no belief in.<br /><br />Plainview also meets a brother with whom he feels close and is able to share his inner feeling until the day that he discovers a truth that changes things forever. Daniel Plainview is a man like no other, he represents to us the dark, the evil of power that enfolds someone in the grip of living a life that does not bother with human relationships. Plainview told his brother,"I look at people and I see nothing worth liking."<br /><br />From the opening scenes of darkness and strife until the final scene that will cut to your core, we sit enmeshed in this story, this film. Paul Anderson, the director has more than a memorable film, it is a monument to the epitome of film making.  I could find nothing to criticize in this film. It will long be remembered as a masterpiece.  From the musical score to the photography to the actors all, everyone and everything is perfect.<br /><br />Highly, Highly, Highly Recommended. prisrob 04-11-08<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783227906">In the Name of the Father</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PAAJYW">Magnolia</a></p></body></html>

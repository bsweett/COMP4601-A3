<meta name="summary" content="A thriller with exceptional middle acts"></head><body><p>This was a very entertaining thriller.  Tom Cruise is a very fine villain and Jamie Foxx does an even better job as the fish out of water hero.  I don't want to say anything about the plot because it is the movement of that plot from what you are set up to expect to what happens that is the real payoff of the movie.  Jada Pinkett Smith plays the super competent (but anxiety filled) and beautiful prosecuting attorney with a good balance of strength and vulnerability.<br /><br />I have to say that Mark Ruffalo and Peter Berg playing the undercover cops and Bruce McGill as the fed do very good work in unfolding the story in a certain direction.  Javier Bardem has a brief but memorable appearance as the drug king pin Felix.  Well, he is more of a mid-level manager of a drug dealing operation, but you will understand all this after you have seen the flick.<br /><br />Cruise's character, Vincent, is usually a pretty cold - force of nature kind of murderer, but he has his own flaws and manages his progress through the plot without perfection.  Foxx's embodiment of Max is actually quite good.  Max has to undergo not only a transformation, but some self-realization that he has been avoiding for quite awhile.<br /><br />I don't want to say anything about the final act, but I didn't find it as fresh as the middle acts, although it still works in its own way.<br /><br />The extras on the second disk are pretty good and provide good background on the movie including how it was made.</p></body></html>

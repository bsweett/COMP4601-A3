<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable Terminator Movie - Recommended"></head><body><p>"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" is a solid sequel to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N5S5">The Terminator (Special Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008PC2O">Terminator 2 - Judgment Day (Extreme DVD)</a>, but it's story line and casting are a little weaker this time.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me. This time SkyNet is targeting the John Conner in his 20s, and once again two Terminators are sent back in time; one to "terminate" and one to protect.<br /><br />There are a lot of technical issues with this movie (i.e. only living flesh can be sent back, remote control of cars and trucks the were not made for it, etc). The casting of John's love interest was an interesting choice, since she looks much older and more mature than he does and they should be the same age.<br /><br />The new "Terminatrix" is very cool and totally scary! Arnold also puts in a strong performance and still looks cools as the "obsolete" model.<br /><br />The Special Effects are very good and likely the best of the lot.<br /><br />This was an enjoyable movie with a little suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of the franchise.<br /><br />CFH</p></body></html>

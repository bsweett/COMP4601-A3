<meta name="summary" content="Like I have said for years , We are the last victims"></head><body><p>David Fincher has brought the "True Crime Movie" back form the dead. This is one of the best "Crime Thrillers" in many-a-moon.<br />  The story is about the hunt for a killer and not about a killer. We follow two reporters(the incredible Robert Downey and a very good Jake Gyllenhaal) and a cop(Mark Ruffalo in the best performance of the movie(and that is saying a lot) as they chase,stumble,backtrack, and slowly lose everything they have chasing the elusive and sneering killer who dares anyone to find him. Leads grow cold and "flakes" of all kind come out of the woodwork as the killings intensified, making the hunt that much slower. The cost to the men is what really makes the movie. Down beat to be sure, but shows how one person even in death affects other lives. Mark Ruffalo ages decades as his life disappears in front of him, and you feel his agony as he tries to catch this madman.  The whole movie grabs you and pulls you along with it and never lets the tension leave you. One of the best</p></body></html>

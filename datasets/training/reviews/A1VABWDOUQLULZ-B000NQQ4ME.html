Captivating as this film was, I could have watched it with no translation of the dialogue and I still would have known everything that was happening.  Such was the power of collective consciousness that it conveyed, however incongruent to history it may be.  The cinematography is beautiful and the hunter vs hunted plot engaging.  Calling on primal triggers and survivalistic instinct is at the core of the success of this film.  Yes, the costumes, jungle settings, buttocks, breasts, and "cultural" details are enthralling.  It is the power of tapping into collective memory and how we have formed our view of ancient heritage that is so astounding.  Is it very accurate?  Are the scenarios presented very likely?  I don't know.  Would anyone know?  Does it matter?  I was intensely curious about the language that was spoken and intend to do some more reading around that.  Given that, the film was provocative enough to make me dig deeper into understanding Mayan culture.</p></body></html>

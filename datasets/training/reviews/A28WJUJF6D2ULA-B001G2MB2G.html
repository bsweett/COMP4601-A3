<meta name="summary" content="The Best Film Of The Summer"></head><body><p>I know some of the detractors of this latest Rowling adaptation have valid points but in my opinion Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is not just a great Harry Potter movie, it is a great movie, period. The makers of the film successfully synthesized the longest Potter novel of the seven and constructed a 138-minute motion picture that moves along through its action without leaving out plot details that made the 2003 novel the wonderfully shadowy read it was. Daniel Radcliffe has grown immeasurably as an actor, as have the other younger cast members, and John Williams' score has never sounded so fitting or so possessing. A strong balance was struck in this outing between atmospheric visuals and dialogue, something sometimes unreached in the last four Harry Potter movies, despite the fact that they, too, were classics. The final sequence wherein Dumbledore and Voldemort wage a wizards' battle was a special effects tsunami that swept aside all disbelief and left everyone I know convinced that should they ever truly witness two wizards in combat, it would look exactly like that! I've seen the Order of the Phoenix three times at the theaters, and still can't wait for the DVD. It is the closest thing to a trip into a magical world we can ever hope to have. Now bring on Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. I'm ready!</p></body></html>

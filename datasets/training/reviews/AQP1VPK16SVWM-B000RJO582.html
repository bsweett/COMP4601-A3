<meta name="summary" content="Strong remake of classic horror film"></head><body><p>It's always a gamble to remake a classic even if the original is a low budget independent horror film. Zack Synder's remake of George Romero's 1978 film "Dawn of the Dead" is every bit as vital, scary and gory as the original film. It's also as unique in its own way as the original film. Synder and screenwriter James Russo keep Romero's basic premise intact but go their own way with much of the story. A mysterious virus has caused the dead to be resurrected as mindless, hungry zombies. These guys aren't your typical lumbering, slow motion zombies either. They're fast moving and deadly (much like those in "28 Days Later"). Once you're bitten by one of the living dead, you will die and become one of them yourself.<br /><br />Sarah Polley plays a nurse who hooks up with a police officer (Ving Rhames)and others fleeing the carnage. They take refuge in the local mall (much like the original film). Here they encounter a trio of security guards who have taken control of the site. At first the group of four strangers are kept under lock and key but, eventually, the tables turn. Unfortunately, the flesh eating zombies are always just outside the door waiting to get in. Like the original, the film dives right into the tense action sequences that dominate the first half of the film. Towards the middle of the film the pacing slows down just a little bit as the survivors make their home in the mall and invite other survivors in as well. The character development and performances here make this more than your standard horror movie. I read a review here that stated the person preferred the original theatrical version. I beg to differ as I feel that the Director's Cut is much more complete and allows for the characters to distinguish themselves as to who they were prior to the crisis. This makes characters that much more believable.<br /><br />The DVD transfer looks pretty darn good. The greenish tinge to the film, oversaturation of color and dark image quality was inherent in the original theatrical version. There's some minor haloing effects but, other than that and a few digital artifacts, the representation here is very, very top quality. The colors are true to the original theatrical version and the sharp image quality makes this one to use as a demo for a high end DVD system for most of the film. The 5.1 Surround Sound mix comes across with crystal clarity and the surround speakers are well used to drop you right into the middle of the survivor's experience.<br /><br />The unrated edtion has some pretty cool special features as well. "The Lost Tape: Andy's Terrifying Last Days Revealed" is a short DVD film that was made specifically for the DVD release and focuses on a gun shop owner stranded on his roof across from the mall who communicates with the survivors via signs. Likewise, the second film "Special Report: We Interrupt This Program" is kind of an extension on the TV footage we briefly glimpse in the movie. It's actually original to the DVD itself and both are unique in that it expands on the original movie's scope and concept. Neither has the best production values nor the best acting but considering that they were made for this DVD release, that's not a surprise. It's like reading two short stories related to a larger novel in that it expands on the experience.<br /><br />We also get a really good audio commentar from Synder and his producer as well as 12 minutes of deleted scenes that weren't put back into this edition. It's clear why most were cut--they didn't work or didn't add anything to the experience. It's still good to have them here. "Attack of the Living Dead" looks at how some of the deaths of people and living dead was created for the film. It might be too much information for some folks. The featurette "Splitting Headaches: Anatomy of Exploding Heads" says everything it needs to in its title.<br /><br />All the featurettes are, for the most part, exceptionally good. If you purchased this at Best Buy or one of the other stores, some were including an extra disc with three featurettes. I haven't had a chance to watch this extra disc yet but given that it isn't included here, I'm not going to really go into it.</p></body></html>

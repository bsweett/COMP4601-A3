Bryan Mills'(Neeson's) teenaged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) travels to Europe where she is stolen and sold into the sex trade.  The film was rated PG-13 but its content, vaguely glossed over for the most part, is anything but.  Quite graphic, the film relies on assumption, bloodless gunfire, and knife fights to push home the point that some people will justify any action to make money. The light treatment of such a horrific crime is somewhat an insult to the film's message. Given its themes the film would have been stronger if it had gone with an R rating, or at least more artfully hinted around disturbing content.  As it was it fell flat in engaging the audience into exactly what was going on, choosing to focus on pyrotechnics and paramilitary posturing.<br /><br />Neeson is not on his game in this role, though he delivers a powerful, decisive father whose drive to save his daughter rivals the darkness of those he pursues.  This is the real story.  What is happening to his daughter is an afterthought, as is his own emotional involvement with what's happening.  That lack is why the feasibility of the story falls apart.  Grace portrays seventeen-year-old Kim more as if she was fourteen, rarely taking a step that she isn't skipping and pouncing like a puppy.  The need to convey her as being innocent and naive is overdone.  The only thing missing was pigtails.  Between the vague content and the over-acted archetypes of powerful father and innocent daughter, the result is this film turns a traumatic experience into an action-oriented thriller, his daughter's story largely lost beside his campaign for conquest.</p></body></html>

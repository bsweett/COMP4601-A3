<meta name="summary" content="blu ray moon shines even on the darkside"></head><body><p>The info says that effects look cheap on this movie, that's not really the case it's got decent effects and the moon outside scenes actually look pretty good. The blu ray version really brings out these effects to good effect too. But Sam Rockwell puts in a incredible performance by any standard. This isn't a slam bang science fiction movie ( which are great too)  it's a intelligent thinking persons movie and It's very well done. The story is a good one and it  is not a slow movie at all. In fact this movie moved quite quickly for me. And Kevin Spacy really was able to make his character of the robot come to life. That's hard to explain but his voice acting was incredible. The robots actions made sense and even the main character comes to see that this machine is more humane than the men who placed him on the moon. I have no doubt that fully sentient machines will evolve in the future and we will by then see them as more than machine in someways.<br /> Kevin spacey and the people who designed this robot have really done things right. The director too; hopefully will keep on making more movies as he can really bring out alot of nuances in a film. This isn't a movie if you are looking for a action sci fi movie but it's story would do well on the now gone classic show 'the outer limits" (one of the few shows that both versions are highly regarded, the classic 60's one and the excellent 90's one). This show also was in my opinion easy to understand and to relate to and that helps.<br />Anyways this is a fine movie and it is a worthy addition to any sci fi fans library especially on blu ray.  This has a short film as a bonus and other features such as 'the making of' etc as well.  A good flick that is better than some a movies due to it's acting, and it shows how good a upper class b movie can be.</p></body></html>

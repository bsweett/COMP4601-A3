<meta name="summary" content="One of the greatest action movies of all time"></head><body><p>Ignore the fact that this is a Rambo movie and some have the audacity to say that Stallone is past his prime.  This Rambo movie is not only the best in the Rambo series, but it's also one of the best action movies of all time.<br /><br />Did you think that Commando had a lot of killing?  BAH!<br />Did you think that Saving Private Ryan had the most gruesome injuries?  Hardly.<br /><br />This movie is saturated with arms being cut off, legs exploding into bloody stumps, heads popping like over-inflated balloons, and enough gun-play to satisfy even the most hardcore, extremist gun-enthusiast.  If it isn't an arrow evenly dividing a man's skull, or someone's intestines being spilled on the ground, then it's an extreme amount of people being sawed in half by high calibre machine gun fire.  There's even a crazy-intense seen in which Rambo basically pulls off the throat removal move from Roadhouse, only with a little slower satisfaction to it.  About the only thing lacking is a Colombian necktie.<br /><br />The story itself plays second-fiddle to the incredible amount of action.  A church-group from Colorado is doing peacework in Burma, bringing medicine and religion to people oppressed by a militaristic regime intent on genocide.  To make their way into hostile territory, the church-goers ask for Rambo's services as a river guide.  At first he is hesitant, but the kind-hearted but deadly Rambo eventually consents.<br /><br />Sure enough, after Rambo drops them off for their jungle-trek to the villagers, the church-group gets caught in the middle of chaos, as the evil military members are senselessly slaughtering every villager in sight.  Once they are captured, it's up to Rambo to save the day.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is a whirlwind of action, as Rambo leads in a hardened group of mercenaries for an extraction mission.  They plan on sneaking into the compound, killing anything and anyone that gets in their way, and saving the prisoners.  What transpires is carnage the likes of which I have never seen before.<br /><br />This version of Rambo is an incredible movie if you're looking for pure action and entertainment from beginning to end.  I haven't been more entertained by a movie in a very long time.</p></body></html>

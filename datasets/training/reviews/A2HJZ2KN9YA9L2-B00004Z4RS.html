<meta name="summary" content="Comic Book Adaptation to Rival Superman-The Movie"></head><body><p>Normally when I watch a movie based on a comic book I cut it a bit of slack when it comes to things like character motivation.  After all, we are dealing with characters who are larger than life.  Heroes wear white and are motivated by a sense of justice, villains wear black and do their evil deeds basically because they are evil.<p>This sort of basic motivation has even snuck into mainstream movies.  Gladiator and The Patriot both had villains who, when asked why they do the evil deeds they do could be expected to reply, &quot;Because I'm the bad guy and that's my job.&quot;  The heroes of these movies are motivated by revenge rather than justice.<p>Here comes X-Men and shows them up with style.  On one side we have Normal Human Senator Kelly, out to register Mutants because he is afraid of them.  He is afraid they will make him obsolete, afraid they have the ability to destroy him at will and he has no way to protect himself from them except by marking them as dangerous beings.<p>On the other side is Magneto, a mutant with the power to control metal and a survivor of the Holocaust.  He sees this as an attempt to bring back those bad old days and is ready to fight it at all costs.<p>Both of these villains have motives that are wholly understandable.  In today's movies that is unusual.  In a movie based on a comic book it seems remarkable.<p>In between these two forces are the X-Men led by Professor Xavier who is out to keep the peace, prevent Senator Kelly's Anti Mutant law from being passed by legitimate debate and similarly try to keep Magneto from killing Normal Humans.  His team rescues Wolverine (Hugh Jackman in what should be a star making performance) and Rogue (The lovely Anna Paquin) from an attack by Magneto.<p>Purists to the comic book may balk at the variations from the original, but these things almost always happen when translating a story from one medium to another.  Even a simple origin story like Superman went through variations when translated to film.  The fact of the matter is that this movie treated the source material with respect in a quest to make a decent movie and the result is a movie which should have been hyped as an event when initially released.</p></body></html>

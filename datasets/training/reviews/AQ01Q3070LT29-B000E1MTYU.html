<meta name="summary" content="Arnold returns as the good terminator. He must save John."></head><body><p>People have waited 12 long years for this sequel.  Of course, you really should see The Terminator (1984) and  Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991) to truly get the full story and know what has happened before to understand the present movie.<br />  The most incredible real-story is Mr. Arnold Schwarzenegger and how timely this movie was.  After the release of this film, five weeks later Arnold Schwarzenegger announced on "The Tonight Show" that he was in the running to be a candidate for Governor of California.  It was the ultimate surprise.  The news media, the reporters and Republicans too were all excited.<br /><br />  On October 7, 2003, Arnold Schwarzenegger won the Recall Election giving him a three-year term as the next Governor of California. He won again in 2006. Governor Schwarzenegger has decided not to work as an actor in films any more.<br /><br /> This 2-disc DVD set offers alot of interesting featurettes.  Two of them are of Arnold during some comedy for you.  There is a goof reel too.  You can choose a selected scene and pick the special effects you want to add.  Then see the clip of the scene play out the way you created it.<br /><br />  Followed by:<br />  ***"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Cronicles" tv series (2008-09)  The story is set after the ending of Terminator 2. The show is now in its second season.<br /><br />  ***Terminator Salvation: The Future Begins (2009). Christian Bale as "John Connor".</p></body></html>

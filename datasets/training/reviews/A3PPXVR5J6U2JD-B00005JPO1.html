<meta name="summary" content="Vine Swinging Monkey Jumps Shark"></head><body><p>Having a baby takes one out of the movie swing of things, so it took a long time before I was able to finally able to see Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. With over 400 reviews at the time of this writing, I'll skip my traditional format of summarizing the movie and just move on to what could have worked and what went horribly, horribly awry.<br /><br />It made perfect sense to place Indy in the 1950s. I appreciated the nods to the 1950s alien invasion genre, which includes everything from Roswell to psychic powers to a rampant fear of Communism.  And the film expertly sets up the 50s, managing to cram in greasers on motorcycles, ice cream shops, Russians, and nuclear bomb tests in the first fifteen minutes.<br /><br />This movie is loaded with fan-service.  There are nods to the other three films, from a fight in the mysterious warehouse at the end of the first movie to Indy starting to speak just like his father ("This is intolerable!") to his fear of snakes. The quicksand scene had me laughing so hard that I was in tears.  But somewhere along the line, Spielberg and Lucas lost sight of the purpose of the film.  It transformed from making a thrilling adventure to a "one last act for Ford, Spielberg, and Lucas."<br /><br />I blame the majority of Crystal Skull's foibles on good old Professor "Ox" Oxley (John Hurt). He is a raving madman who has already made it through all the traps leading up to the crystal skull's resting place, so it's not particularly exciting to have Indy decipher his mad ramblings or retrace his steps. This is an Indy adventure in reverse - Indy HAS the object and he's trying to put it BACK. Which isn't all that exciting.<br /><br />The villains just aren't all that villainous.  Col. Dr. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) is a caricature of a Russian that's not all that scary.  Her claim to fame appears to be that she carries a sword (how quaint!). The master plan seems to be vaguely along the lines of "we're going to capture this artifact we don't understand and use it to conquer the world!" It's not even clear the Russians would know what to do with the skull, much less put it to nefarious use. The Australian turncoat is both obviously a turncoat and barely comprehensible. And don't get me started on the bug-squishing scenes that involving ant-ichor splashing on the camera...not once, but TWICE.<br /><br />Mutt (Shia LeBouf) is a cardboard personality - it took me a second to realize that he never actually cries on cue (the camera whips over to him already misty with tears...twice), filled with angst over Ox, the guy we've never heard of. Mutt appears, with a wink and a nod, to be Indy's successor, but it's a heavy-handed portrayal: Mutt doesn't read but he's worldly! Mutt knows fencing but practices with a knife (that he never uses)! Mutt can ride a motorcycle and calls Indy "old man"! See Mutt swing from a vine and...<br /><br />I saw this one coming when Mutt got separated from the rest of the group during a fight chase. I prayed: "Dear Lucas, please, please, PLEASE do not have Mutt swing from vines." Then the animated monkeys show up, in much the same way animated gophers showed up in the beginning of the film and threatened to turn Crystal Skull into a nuclear <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J07O">Caddyshack</a>. I prayed again.  "Please, please, please, don't have the monkeys swing along with Mutt and help him attack the Russians.  Please, please, please..." Then the monkeys attack. Ever see the Simpsons episode, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FO0AME">In Marge We Trust</a>," where Reverend Lovejoy fights off the baboons?  It's like that.<br /><br />In the "making of" docs, Spielberg dismisses using the Nazis as villains out of hand.  And yet he went with an off-the-wall sci-fi theme that Lucas struggles to make Indy-esque.  They could have easily included <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1892062097">Nazis, UFOs, aliens, and arctic bases</a> in one neat, conspiracy-laden package.  Instead, two movie-making giants took a weak premise and turned it into an opportunity for nostalgia. It's like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007P0XBO">Ocean's Twelve</a>and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W1V5VU">13</a>...you get the impression the cast is more interested in working than in making the movie work.<br /><br />Crystal Skull isn't the worst movie ever.  But as a final chapter in the Indiana Jones canon, it's more <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ON4">Temple of Doom</a> than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014C2FX8">Last Crusade</a>.</p></body></html>

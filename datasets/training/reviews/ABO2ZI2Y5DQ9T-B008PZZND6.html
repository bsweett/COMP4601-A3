Some of you might find the film's theme not so attractive at first, but don't worry, the film can be appreciated as a love story, and a very good and nuanced one too.<br /><br />The quiet opening section is the strongest part, where Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) are hired to guard the sheep in the mountains in the early 1960s. The sparse use of dialogues and soundtrack enhance the emotional tension between them, with a help from the stunning photography of Rodrigo Prieto, who captures the serene beauty of Brokeback Mountain,<br /><br />Then we meet Ennis and Jack four years later, both married and with children. While Jack considers the possibility of living together, Ennis, who recounts a horrible episode from his childhood memories, evades the topic altogether, suggesting his repressed fear about the consequences of such a life. However, as time goes by - and the film covers about 20 years of their life -- their hidden (so they believe) relations inevitably influence those around them, especially the life of Alma (Michelle Williams), Ennis's wife.<br /><br />First and foremost, `Brokeback Mountain' is a success as the poignant love story between Ennis and Jack. Jake Gyllenhaal is good as Jack, clearly more seductive of the two, but it is Heath Ledger who embodies the sadness of these two lovers. Ennis is a good example of a lonely soul, who knows nothing about his own life except that he messed it up somewhere in the past.<br /><br />Female roles are less impressive though Michelle Williams shines as tormented wife of Ennis. Ann Hathaway plays Laureen, Jack's wife, but talented as she is, I think the NYC-born actress is miscast as Texas girl. (And there are brief nudity of them, which is totally unnecessary here.) Anna Faris, Linda Cardellini, and Kate Mara also appear, but with the exception of Kate Mara, who plays the daughter of Ennis and seeks for the love of her father, the good cast is largely wasted.<br /><br />`Brokeback Mountain' is not without flaws. Perhaps it could have been better with more time to tell the story, but the emotional power of the central theme is strong all the same, and the end results of their story are simply overwhelming.</p></body></html>

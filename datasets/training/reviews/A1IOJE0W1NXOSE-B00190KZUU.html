<meta name="summary" content="Reality vs. fantasy"></head><body><p>Will and his father Edward have become estranged over the years because of the many tall tales that Edward has told his son.  When Will receives a phone call from his mother telling him that his father is dying, he knows he must go to him and find out who his father really is and what is the truth about his life.  Whenever Will asks questions, his father replies with the outlandish stories that he has heard all of his life.  As the movie continues, Will finds out that not all of his father's stories are fantasy, and those that are have served a purpose in his life.  This is a beautifully told tale of fact vs. fancy, and the reconciliation of a father and son.  It is touching and is well-acted and directed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Don Juan in Hell"></head><body><p>Jim Jarmusch continues his exploration of the human plight with BROKEN FLOWERS, a story he both wrote and directed, and this time he examines the psyche and the consequences of the Don Juan complex.  In doing so he offers a quiet meditation about choices and their reverberations and leaves  many thoughts open-ended, a definite tribute to the intelligence of his viewers and followers.<br /><br />Don Johnston (Bill Murray) is a middle aged bachelor who has devoted his life to being a success in computer work, all the while being a lothario with countless women used as  sexual partners over his lifetime. His most recent paramour Sherry (Julie Delphy) has just left him: 'You make me feel like a mistress and you're not even married!'.  He now lives alone in Anywhere, USA, his only friends being his next-door neighbor, novelist Winston (Jeffrey Wright) and his wife Mona (Heather Simms) and five children. Don receives a pink envelope in the mail, no signature, no return address, informing him he has a 19-year-old son  who may be out looking for him.  Don's affect is flat: he has no idea of his parenthood or the identity of the mother.<br /><br />Winston is curious, takes the letter in hand and begins detective work to find out whom the mother might be.  In a matter of days he has located four prospects from a list Don reluctantly and fuzzily makes of girlfriends from 20 years ago, makes all the travel arrangements, gives detective type advice, and  sets Don (Juan) Johnston off on his journey with instructions to greet each of the four with a bouquet of pink flowers.  The four women are a disparate group: Laura (Sharon Stone) and her au natural daughter Lolita (Alexis Dziena) where he pauses for a physical dalliance; Dora (Frances Conroy); animal communicator Dr. Carmen Markowski (Jessica Lange) with her sexy office assistant (Chlo? Sevigny); and Penney (Tilda Swinton) whose fellow bikers beat him.  Don returns home, without having a clue as to who sent the letter or has the son.<br /><br />Back at home he receives a second pink letter which he turns over to Winston: case unsolved.  He remains a lonely man, befriends a young lad (Mark Webber) at the thought he may be the son, but that too leaves stories unresolved.  Was the lad his son,  had he met the mother, or is this all a concoction for a novel by his best friend Winston?<br /><br />Jarmusch leaves the ending to the audience.  He has created enough characters with whom we can identify and understand and then just leaves it there.  The cast is excellent, with Bill Murray's Don being the finest interpretation of his career. Each of the cameos is brief but fully realized and allows each of the actors a divergent role from their usual casting.  Though promoted as a comedy this story is more of a meditation on lust, desire, loneliness, and failure to connect.  It is a fine little film.  Recommended.  Grady Harp, January 06</p></body></html>

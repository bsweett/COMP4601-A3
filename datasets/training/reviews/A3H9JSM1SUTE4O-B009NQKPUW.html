<meta name="summary" content="NICE VISUALS BUT...  SO DISAPPOINTING"></head><body><p>This hugely anticipated film was attended by me and my family that range in age from teens through 70s.  After a very long discussion at lunch, none of us felt we were satisfied and we agreed the story was convoluted and ineptly told.  So many unanswered questions and so many dumb scenes and situations that seemed contrived or exploitive and in no way touched on the very big issues that were hinted at.<br /><br />We're all educated and we love movies of all kinds.  We discussed the hints of pagan and Christian mythology as well as possible source material for the story (such as it was) on screen.  Was it lifted from Ray Bradbury's poem "Christus Apollo"?  And why does it have an eerie resemblance to a "Dr. Who" episode that includes a Dr Shaw character, Prometheus and a big element of one of the apparent central themes?<br /><br />That said, Noomi Repace was excellent and so was Michael Fassbender as an android.  The visuals were of course cutting edge as in all of Ridley Scott's films.  But that's not enough for a satisfying movie experience.  This near debacle of a movie does not even come close to ALIEN.  The whole enterprise was either not thought out enough or way over-thought.  Or it was just a quick way to make a buck.  Too bad.  So sad.  It could have been stupendously magnificent.</p></body></html>

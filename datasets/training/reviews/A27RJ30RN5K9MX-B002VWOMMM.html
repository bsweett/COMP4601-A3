<meta name="summary" content="This is an amazing film"></head><body><p>William Munny ( Clint Eastwood), is a former gunslinger who comes out of retirement for one last job. He is joined by his friend and former partner Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), and a wanna-be gunslinger named &quot;The Schofield Kid&quot; (Jaimz Woolvett). The three set out to Big Whiskey, Wyoming where a group of prostitutes are seeking revenge for one of their own that gets raped, and cut up extremely bad. &quot;Little&quot; Bill Dagget ( Gene Hackman)is the sadistic and corrupt sheriff of Big Whiskey, and is desperate to keep bounty hunters from collecting on the money that the prostitutes are offering. English Bob(Richard Harris), is a legendary gunfighter who rides into town, and is also looking to collect on the reward. English Bob just happens to be an old rival of &quot;Little&quot; Bill's, and Bill is looking to make an example out of him. But the real focus of the film is on Will Munny, and the conflict that he must face within himself. As the story unfolds, Munny tries to convince himself that his return to the life is just temporary. But the consequences of his actions, could last him a lifetime... <p>&quot;Unforgiven&quot; is one of the finest Westerns ever made. Clint Eastwood succeeded on both sides of the camera with his role of William Munny, and his direction of the film. However, Eastwood is not the only reason for the film's success. The rest of the cast could not have done a better job. Morgan Freeman, Jaimz Woolvett, and Richard Harris all give amazing performances. However the standout performance of the film goes to Gene Hackman as the sadistic sheriff &quot;Little Bill&quot;. It is one of the best performances of his career. The musical score is haunting as well as beautiful, and it really drives the film. The cinematography is amazing as well. Everything about the film is perfect. The film was winner of 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director - Clint Eastwood and Best Supporting Actor- Gene Hackman. <p>I was overjoyed when the 10th Anniversary Edition DVD was released. The extras are worth the price alone. Disc 1 features a beautiful transfer of the film, as well as commentary from Eastwood and his biographer Richard Schickel. Disc 2 brings 4 outstanding documentaries which includes interviews with the entire cast, the making of the film, and a lot more. There is also an episode of the TV show &quot;Maverick&quot; co-starring Clint Eastwood. The movie was already a must have on its own. But now with the 10th Anniversary Special Edition, there is no way that you can afford to pass it up!</p></body></html>

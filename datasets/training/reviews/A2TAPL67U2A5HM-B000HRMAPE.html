Tom Cruise is amazing and the part that he plays is so much more complex and demanding then in the first two movies in the Mission Impossible series. The special effects are some of the best in the business and the music is right on the mark. The script is action packed and yeah some scenes are like totally unrealistic but hey if I want to watch realism that I can turn on CNN anytime and watch that. Laurence Fishburne does a bang up job and so does Luther Stickel. I loved this movie and I would recommend them doing a MI 4. 5 out of 5 stars. Highly recommended indeed.</p></body></html>

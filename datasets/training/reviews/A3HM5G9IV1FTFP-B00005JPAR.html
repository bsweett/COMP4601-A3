And it's far from terrible ... in fact, aesthetically, it's a gorgeous film, beautiful shot and art-directed, with a haunting musical score. Hugh Jackson and Rachel Weisz give great performances and have good chemistry. But something was just missing. I'm not even sure what, but it just didn't draw me in. I was hoping to be moved, provoked and inspired by this film, but I just wasn't. It certainly wasn't insincere, schlocky, or trite. It just didn't make the leap from interesting to resonant.<br /><br />I'd call this a bold, ambitious effort by a talented director who will surely produce more great films (like "Requiem for a Dream") in the future.</p></body></html>

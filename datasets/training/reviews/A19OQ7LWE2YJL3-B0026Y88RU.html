<meta name="summary" content="Super! Why didn't I hear about it when it came out!!"></head><body><p>This was a super movie. Nice intelligent writing. Terrific acting by Hartnett, Kingsley, and Freeman. Willis' role cold probably have been played by anyone, but he was effective.  Lucy Lui was OK as the love interest, though not as cute as the part should have been. Her acting was good.<br /><br />The storyline was good, the beginning frustrated me a little - not knowing what the heck was going on. But you catch on fast and before you realize it, the game is ON.<br /><br />I liked Josh Hartnett in this the best yet of any of is prior films. He comes out of the cardboard box much more and we can see there is an interesting actor there. Kingsley is awesome & Morgan freeman is always superb.<br /><br />One complaint: what Einstein took decided to delete those funny scenes at the end of the DVD?  They were FABULOUS!  I liked the real ending though better than the optional alternate ending.</p></body></html>

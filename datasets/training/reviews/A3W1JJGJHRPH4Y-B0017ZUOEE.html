<meta name="summary" content="Finely Crafted Horror Movie"></head><body><p>The movie is more of a character study than a horror movie. The movie does a great job of presenting a puzzle that the mother has to solve to get her son back. The movie is scary, but the gore is at a minimum level. The horror of losing one's child is horror enough. The acting is superb. The plot is finely crafted. The movie introduces very minor story lines or themes that are nicely tied together at the end. I won't give up the ending, but it fits almost too nicely.</p></body></html>

However having picked the DVD cheap, and rewatched the film I have revised my opinion somewhat. This is actually rather clever, and mostly very entertaining, and would have got 3 and 1/2 stars if that was possible.<br /><br />The good things about it are the split screen effects, which recreate the comic book style well, and the story which has a little more depth to it than some comic book films. As for the Hulk himself he is a marvellous creation. For one thing he's much bigger than in the original comics, where he was maybe 7ft tall, in this I'd guess he's more like 20ft tall. Of course this doesn't help with the problem of how his trousers stay on!<br />Strangely for me the CGI effects seem to work better at home than when I saw it in the cinema. Maybe I was just expecting too much at the cinema.<br /><br />On the down side I really only have one criticsm and that is that at 2 hours and 10 mins its a little too long.<br /><br />The extras are pretty good with the Hulk Cam certainly being worth watching, as it gives you an entertaining insight into how the film was made and some of the problems of filming around a main character who doesn't exist.<br /><br />So overall at the right price this is well worth getting.</p></body></html>

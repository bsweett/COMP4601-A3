<meta name="summary" content="X-Men(2000)"></head><body><p>Never doubt the efficacy of prayer! X-Men(2000) was a critical and commercial success. It spawned two sequels...and two prequels. The film pleases X-Men fans and non-fans. The film stays true to the comic book and never turns into camp. Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman were inspired choices for Professor Charles Xavier(a.k.a. Professor X) and Wolverine. X-Men takes place in a world where mutants are oppressed by "normal people". Mutants led by Professor Xavier try to be tolerant while mutants led by Magneto(Ian McKellan) are radical and extremist! Magneto has a diabolical weapon that can turn "normal people" into mutants!<br /> Director Bryan Singer(The Usual Suspects, Apt Pupil, House, Superman Returns) takes the X-Men story seriously. The late Michael Kamen wrote a solid music score for X-Men. The scene where Wolverine and Sabertooth fight on the Statue of Liberty is an homage to A Man Called Hero(1999). X-Men has a fair amount of humor. Cyclops(James Marsden) asks Wolverine if he "wants yellow spandex". Anna Paquin is quite good as a teenage version of Rogue. Ray Park isn't bad as Toad. He played Darth Maul in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace(1999). The X-Men film franchise got off to a good start, but now it's struggling to stay alive.</p></body></html>

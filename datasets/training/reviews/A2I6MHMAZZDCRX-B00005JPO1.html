"Part Time.""></head><body><p>In the year 1957, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) has been captured by a group of KGB agents led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) and taken to Area 51 in the Nevada desert to find one particular box in a warehouse full of government secrets.  While that box does fall into enemy hands, Indiana does manage to escape.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these are the days of the Red Scare, and the fact that the Soviets now have that box means Indiana is now on a government watch list.  Just as this is making things hard on his day job as a professor, Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) finds Indiana.  Mutt quickly tells him that Indiana's old college friend Ox (John Hurt) has been captured and needs Indiana's help.  So it's off to South America on the trail of the fabled City of Gold and the crystal skull necessary to open it.  Irina is only one step behind Indy, however.  Can Indy figure out Ox's notes and rescue his friend while staying one step ahead of the Soviets?<br /><br />I never watched the Indiana Jones movies until I hit college, watching the second one earlier this year for the first time.  I think that helped my perspective.  While I enjoyed the movies, I was able to see (and overlook) their flaws.<br /><br />And that's what you have to do here, too.  Yes, there were some slow parts, but there was still plenty of action and humor.  And I loved those blink and you miss them references to the earlier films.  The emphasis here is on stunts and action, keeping the special effects to a minimum until the climax.  What special effects we did get did show how far we've come in the last 20 years.  The acting was great, especially Cate Blanchett who managed to steal some of her scenes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, one of the biggest moments of the film was spoiled early.  It was still great, but it would have been so much better as a surprise.<br /><br />The only real problem I have with the film is the climax, which was pretty out there.  And considering the original films, that's saying something.  I've mellowed a little over time, so it's not quite the disaster it once was in my eyes.<br /><br />On the whole, I'll be able to accept where they went with the ending and enjoy the film for what it is, an escapist action movie that entertains.  This isn't serious movie making, but Indiana never has been.  This is definitely a movie to consider the next time you want some escapist action.</p></body></html>

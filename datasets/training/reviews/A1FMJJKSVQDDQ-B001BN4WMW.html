<meta name="summary" content="Historically inaccurate, but I don't care . . ."></head><body><p>If I were to study about William Wallace, I wouldn't do it with Mel Gibson's classic "Braveheart"; I would go to the library to do it. The film is filled with historical inaccuracies, like Stirling Bridge and the Battle at York. But that's because this is based on the LEGEND of Wallace, and not history.<br /><br />But anyway, this is my second favorite film from director Mel Gibson, only behind the more recent Apocalypto. It's in the grand-scale epic tradition: it's more than three hours long, it has intense battle sequences, it has a cold and heartless villain, etc. What I love most about this film are the battle scenes. The skirmish at Wallace's home, and the chaotic confrontation at Stirling, York, and Falkirk are bloody and gory and ultimately brutal. I won't tell you how brutal the action is, but I can tell you that they are some of the greatest captured on film. Sure, "Gladiator" had some gore, too, but this one takes the cake for me.<br /><br />The acting may be a bit exaggerated in some scenes, but it sure fits in the epic genre. I don't think I can find a better actor who can play William Wallace than Gibson himself. His Scottish accent is almost perfect, and the way he encourages the Scottish to fight for their freedom is just amazing. Patrick McGoohan plays Edward the Longshanks, the king who would most love to hate. He's got the cold personality down perfectly. Sophie Marceau is enchanting as Princess Isabelle, a woman who is not really loved by her husband. Catherine McCormack as William's love, Murron, is also beautiful and lights up the screen when she's with Wallace. Angus McFayden as Robert the Bruce gives out a great performance as he starts to see why Wallace is fighting for freedom. The supporting cast (O'Hara as Stephen, Gleeson as Hamish, Cosmo as Campbell the Elder) play their parts splendidly.<br /><br />I can tolerate the movie "300" for its fantastic visuals, but not for its incredibly inaccurate history. But I tolerate "Braveheart" more because it's one film that I grew up with. Both films are about freedom, and both handle the main theme very well. But I prefer "Braveheart".<br /><br />A-</p></body></html>

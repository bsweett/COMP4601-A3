<meta name="summary" content="Too long, too slow"></head><body><p>Hard to believe that this is the same director who directed Clockwork Orange. I get the uber wealthy illuminati families, I always thought that's what went on in those huge mansions anyway, along with the satan worship and blood sacrifices.  But, I didn't think it could be sooooooo long and boring.  If it wasen't for the prettyness of the 2 main characters and skinny model nudity, no one would watch it or try to figure out what the "deep" meaning of it is suppose to be, Oh, did anyone else notice that in almost every scene there was a christmas tree with colored lights? Oh,wait, I get it now, life is ugly but, the colored lights are pretty. Very deep.<br />When I do watch this movie, it really makes me wonder how Tom could divorce the beautiful Nicole for the blah Katie, no accounting for taste I guess, and was it a real marriage anyway? Enjoy!</p></body></html>

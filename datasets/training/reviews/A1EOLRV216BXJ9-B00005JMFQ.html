<meta name="summary" content="Truly Romantic Classic - Less is More"></head><body><p>This is such a well-written piece on romantic relationships. Its success lie in its wide appeal. I ask my friends and all have their own favorite characters and moments in the movie. I watched it 3 times and I find my favorite scenes change too. There is the writer (Colin Firth)'s proposal  to his Portugese maid. Not to forget the hilarious Hugh Grant performing his dance sequence. Keira Knightly with her secret admirer opening his heart to her at the doorstep can be overwheming. Not to mention the modern London feel throughout the movie.<br /><br />These wonderful short stories are so fragmented when I watched it the first time there is a longing for more. It allows me to repeat watching the movie again with nice surprises here and there. The fact that each piece is so short allows the audience to feel rather than being told the story.<br /><br />This is one of the few romantic classics in recent years that arouses such warm and deep feelings from a wide range of audience - young and old. An excellent combo of romantic moments that can truly stand the test of time.</p></body></html>

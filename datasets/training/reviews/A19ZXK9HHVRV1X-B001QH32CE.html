<meta name="summary" content="innate charm overcomes inconsistent tone"></head><body><p>Ever since she was a little girl, Jenna (Keri Russell) has been concocting world-class pie recipes - a different pie, in fact, for every mood and occasion that life has to offer.  Now, in her thirties, she finds herself stuck working as a waitress in somebody else's pie shop and trapped in a loveless marriage to a domineering and physically abusive lout named Earl.  And, oh yes, she also happens to be pregnant.<br /><br />This is the set-up for "Waitress," a slick, low-budget independent romantic comedy that was one of the genuine sleeper hits of 2007.  It is also the movie that marked the final work of the gifted writer/director/co-star Adrienne Shelley who was tragically murdered by a burglar about six months prior to the release of the film.<br /><br />That morbid taint notwithstanding, "Waitress" is a generally amiable comedy that, despite its small town New England setting and naturalistic performances, isn't always as genuine and authentic as it needs to be to be effective.  The scenes between Jenna and her fellow waitresses (Shelley, Cheryl Hines) do have the ring of "girl talk" truth about them, but those involving Jenna and the dreamy young pediatrician who's just set up his practice in town come across as pure Hollywood contrivance and hokum.<br /><br />Russell has warmth and appeal as the deeply unhappy and conflicted Jenna, and she receives excellent support from Shelley and Hines as her encouraging and understanding co-workers and friends.  Nathan Fillion, however, makes for a rather bland love interest as the gallant and gorgeous - albeit married - Doctor Pomatter, while the truly talented Jeremy Sisto ("Six Feet Under") struggles under the weight of a poorly written part as Jenna`s irredeemably smarmy and churlish husband - a character that's at least a half a dozen shades too dark for a comedy as innocuous and lighthearted in tone as this one is.  In fact, one of the major weaknesses in the script is its insistence on seeing its main male characters in two-dimensional rather than three-dimensional terms.  Of the actors, though, it is the venerable Andy Griffith who steals every scene he's in as the crusty but wise owner of the diner who sets Jenna straight on a thing or two regarding how she`s choosing to live her life.<br /><br />There's a nice fairy tale ending to leave you feeling uplifted and good about life - which is just about all one really asks for from a film such as this one, I guess.<br /><br />Be forewarned, however:  this movie is not recommended for anyone who is on a strict diet or who is in any way serious about reducing calories.</p></body></html>

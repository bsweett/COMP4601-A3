<meta name="summary" content="They Did It!  They Pulled It Off...An Excellent Remake!!  Two Thumbs Up - Awesome Comedy!"></head><body><p>Adam Sandler (Paul Crewe) is great in this film.  Heck, everyone is great in this film!  This is one of the best remakes I have ever seen.<br /><br />One of the best things about the film is Sandler actually looks tired, beat, and downright exactly how I would picture a former NFL star quarterback who lost it all and ends up in jail.  Sandler proves that he has staying power with this film.<br /><br />Chris Rock (Caretaker) is excellent as the man to talk to and get the lowdown on prison life (more importantly, how to not end up someone's girlfriend).  Rock has some really funny lines, and he just seemd to fit this role better than I thought he would.  I think this is his greatest work yet, and I hope he just keeps moving up from here.  "Hey, Chris, if you read this, thanks for making me laugh out loud after an eighty-hour work week!  You rock, Rock."<br /><br />Burt Reynolds (Coach Nate Scarborough)didn't turn in the performance of a lifetime or anything, but he didn't do all that bad either.  The man has been through so much in his life, it was cool just to know he has bounced back so many times.  He's not a quitter, that's for sure.  I think he's a lot like the coach he played in the movie.  I still want to buy that Trans-Am from Smokey and The Bandit!  If you read this, Mr. Reynolds, can I at least take the T/A out for a weekend?  C'mon, I've spent a lot of loot on your films.<br /><br />William Fichtner (Captain Knauer) is always great in whatever role he plays.  From "Grace Under Fire" to "Contact" to "The Longest Yard", Fichtner is one of my favorite actors.  He never overacts.  He never underacts.  He just slides into a role as himself, and somehow makes it work like it's nobody's business.<br /><br />Nelly (Megget) has got skills - acting skills that is.  It was almost like he has been in jail before.  He was that good!  But best of all, he actually managed to pull off the small amount of talking parts and still be so memorable in the film.<br /><br />Megget: "Y'all got a running back?"<br /><br />Paul Crewe: "Not any good ones."<br /><br />Ya gotta love it!<br /><br />Michael Irvin, Walter Williamson, David Patric Kelly (Warriors, come out to play!), Goldberg (Who's Next?), Terry Crews (with cheese), Bob Sapp (He broke-ded my nose), and the rest of the cast deserve all the credit in the world for coming together to make one of the best movie remakes in the history of film!<br /><br />This movie has a little bit of everything.  See it, buy it, rent it...whatever...just don't skip it.<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></body></html>

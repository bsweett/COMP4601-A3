A baby that crawls inside Santa's bag of toys on a fateful Christmas Eve and thus is raised by the elves in the North Pole.  As the human (Buddy the Elf, of course) grows, he can't help but notice he's "different."  And finally, Buddy is told the somber truth--that he is not an elf, that he is a human, and that his father (who happens to be on Santa's "Naughty List") resides in Manhattan.  And so Buddy sets off, on foot, (after saying goodbye to various animated North Pole pals) to the Big Apple, where mayhem reigns supreme upon his arrival.<br /><br />Like I said:  nonsense.  But funny nonsense.  Will Ferrell plays Buddy with simultaneous naivete and tongue-in-cheek raunchiness; he more than carries this film on his bright green shoulders.  James Caan is pure vanilla bland as Buddy's reluctant, long-lost father, while Bob Newhart is at his deadpan best.  The plot is hokey, the ending syrupy (as is Buddy's diet) and contrived, yet ELF had me laughing in spite of my curmudgeonly self.  The holy grail of entertainment is escapism, and ELF takes the viewer directly into the story and doesn't let go until the last giggle.<br /><br />This is a movie not only appropriate for Yuletide cheer, but anytime one needs a raucous laugh.  My only concern is my utter confusion:  ELF's elves are little munchkin midgets, while the elves in "Lord of the Rings" are tall and stoic.  Wow.  Guess I've gotta brush up on my elfology.<br /><br />--D. Mikels</p></body></html>

The cast was a group of actors that weren't on my A list and I have never been impressed by James L Brooks' movies (loved his television work but not his films).  I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson plays Melvin Udell, a compulsive obsessive writer.  Everything in is live is constant from how he locks his door to having the same table at his corner restaurant.  This is a typical quirky Nicholson role but the difference is that this character grows throughout the film.<br /><br />Helen Hunt plays Carol Connelly, the only waitress that Melvin will allow to wait on him.  Everything in her live is chaos from her job to her chronically ill son.  This is a tour de force performance.  She gets to show the gamut of emotion during this film.<br /><br />Greg Kinnear plays Nicholson's neighbor Simon Bishop.  Melvin shows no restraint in his distaste of Simon's lifestyle.  This is Kinnear's breakout performance.<br /><br />When Simon is beaten up, Melvin is forced into his life.  Melvin forces his way into<br /><br />Carol's life when her son condition worsens.  In the end, Melvin uses Simon's need to visit his parents to get Carol to come on the road trip.  This road trip is the best part of the film.  Each character is forced to grow a little and has some of the best one liners.<br /><br />The only problem with this film is to accurately classify it.  It starts out as a social comedy but develops into a romantic comedy.  Whatever it is you should enjoy it.<br /><br />BEST LINE: "You make me want to be a better man" and "What if this is as good as it gets".<br /><br />DVD EXTRAS: Commentary by Brooks, Nicholson, Hunt and Kinnear</p></body></html>

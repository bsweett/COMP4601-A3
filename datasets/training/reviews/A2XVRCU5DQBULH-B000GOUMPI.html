<meta name="summary" content="A creepy horror flick with great Nicholson"></head><body><p>While it's definitely not Stanley Kubrick's best film, "The Shining" is a definitely good movie. However, it's not quite up there with the likes of "The Exorcist" or "Evil Dead." The story, based on Stephen King's novel (though King hates the movie), is about the Torrance family moving to the Overlook Hotel to tend to it during the winter. The father Jack slowly begins to lose his mind and is soon chasing after his wife and son, which eventually goes outside into one of the scariest, most haunting chase scenes ever. The movie gets a little boring at times, with shots going a little longer than needed, but the story is very thick and we care for the characters. Jack Nicholson steals the show, however, in a role that will almost have you rooting for him, the villain! While it doesn't really mess with your mind, it still delivers the goods and is occasionally very, very scary.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great movie!"></head><body><p>I love this movie. Everything about it rules. It is hilarious. You have to see the DVD though because there is alot of cursing.<p>The best thing about it is John Goodman. He dominates every scene he's in. The Coen Brothers did a great job in making the dude calm, and making Walter infuriate him. Basically the dude has to find some money he failed at delivering, and a bunch of people want it. Walter(John Goodman) decides that it is time to take matters into his hands.<p>5 stars!</p></body></html>

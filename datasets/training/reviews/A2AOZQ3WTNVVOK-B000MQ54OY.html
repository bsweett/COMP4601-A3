<meta name="summary" content="Mumble Talks with His Feet"></head><body><p>Life in the Antarctic is tough.  The weather is usually too chilly for golf.  It is tough to build a fire because there are no trees and thus no wood.  There are no fast food restaurants for a long way.  Then there are the leopard seals.<br /><br />Mumble (voiced by Elijah "Frodo Baggins" Wood) is hatched to Norma Jean (voice of Nicole Kidman) and Memphis (voice of Hugh Jackman) during a period when female penguins are off fishing.  Life might have been different if Memphis, in a rash moment, had not dropped his egg.<br /><br />As it turns out, penguins are quite musical, at least in this movie they are.  Unfortunately, Mumble is unable to sing.  However, Mumble can dance like Fred Astaire and Bill Robinson and anyone else you can name all put together.  Of course, few penguins are enthused about changing the status quo.  Singing is a good thing, and dancing is strictly forbidden.  After having a rough childhood and having a crush on Gloria (voiced by Brittany Murphy), Mumble is off on his own.<br /><br />Other penguins have other standards and Mumble's ability to dance is an instant hit with the penguins on the other side of the glacier.  Mumble only makes one mistake, and that is to, once again, challenge the status quo when he points out that Barry White impersonator Lovelace (Robin Williams) is a fraud.<br /><br />Poor Mumble is an outcast from just about everywhere, so he decides it is time to track down the aliens that have been chasing away all the fish.  The aliens find Mumble and put him into a strange place where there is a lot of food and a very bizarre environment.  Mumble manages to run into a couple of walls before he realizes that he is not in the Antarctic any more.  Lucky for Mumble the aliens appreciate a good dancer, even if he is dressed in a penguin suit, and the aliens permit Mumble to return to Antarctica, with an electronic decoration.<br /><br />The leaders of the penguins greet Mumble's return with disdain until the aliens show up, and suddenly penguins are line dancing all over the place with abandon.<br /><br />This movie is alternately cute and absurd.  This movie contains a number of positive messages about being different and acceptance.  Much of the movie is accurate regarding the behavior of penguins as they care for their eggs and how they deal with the long Antarctic night.  Much of the movie is funny and is just like the cartoon I expected.  On the flip side, penguins are not intelligent aliens and communicating with dance moves instead of tones (thinking of "Close Encounters of the Third Kind") was just a bit bizarre.  I think the environmental message of this film would have been just as effective with cutesy cartoonish penguins as opposed to tap dancing line dancing penguins.<br /><br />I do not recommend this movie for young children for several reasons.  First is the scene with the skuas.  These predatory birds do attack and eat baby penguins in a gory way.  Second, leopard seals eat just about anything they can catch, including penguins.  Antarctic researchers also avoid leopard seals.  Third, how do you explain why Mumble was eating a bloody chunk of fish (that's not Nemo, it is just sushi, children)?  I can see younger children having nightmares after this movie.  I have yet to mention the numerous adult references, but added together, you can see that this animated film is not for young children.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn that this movie is controversial because of its environmental message.  The movie is reasonably accurate regarding environmental issues and I think children need exposure to this kind of information so that they have an opportunity to help save our planet.  The Lord knows we have managed to do a pretty poor job of that to this point.  However, that exposure needs to be limited to older children because this movie is not for younger children who will have problems with some of the messages in this film.<br /><br />Good Luck!</p></body></html>

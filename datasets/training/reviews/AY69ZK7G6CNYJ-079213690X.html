Filmed against the backdrop of majestic mountains and rolling meadows, it tells the historically-based story of William Wallace, a common man's warrior who led the Scottish people in rebellion against King Edward I "Longshanks".<br /><br />Set in the 11th Century, Braveheart catalogues the struggle Scottish serfs faced under the brutal oppression of England. Against this backdrop, William Wallace (Mel Gibson) falls in love with Murron MacClannough (Catherine McCormack). Insistent that he will not share his wife (proclamation by the king gives local rulers first-night rights to new brides), Wallace secretly marries Murron in the dark of night. But when an English knight assaults her, Wallace sparks a fight. Fleeing the village, Wallace thinks that Murron has escaped and will soon meet him in their secret rendezvous point. But Murron is captured and put to death the king's emissaries.<br /><br />Angered at his wife's murder, Wallace starts a small rebellion, slaughtering all of the king's loyalists in the village. The rebellion quickly grows with more and more men joining each day. Distraught, Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan) dispatches the Northern Army to destroy Wallace and his followers. Wallace delivers a stirring speech to rouse his men, and he employs an ingenious battlefield trick to defeat the king's cavalry. The Wallace rebellion continues unhindered as York is sacked and the rebels approach the heart of England.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Longshanks sends his daughter-in-law, Princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau) on a peace mission to meet with Wallace. On the king's behalf, she offers him gold, land, anything he wants if he will only stop the rebellion. She and her servants are greatly impressed with the sophistication displayed by Wallace, who speaks fluent French and does not resemble his barbarian myth.<br /><br />Wallace turns down the offer made by Princess Isabelle, but he knows that he can not win Scottish freedom on his own. He needs the support of the noblemen. The leader of the nobles is Robert the Bruce (Angus MacFadyen) who struggles against his own idyllic view of the world and his father's pessimistic pragmatism. After much struggle, Robert decides to work with Wallace, but remains unaware that his father has betrayed Wallace into the hands of Longshanks.<br /><br />As Longshanks lies on his deathbed, his daughter-in-law whispers in his ear that the child she is carrying belongs to William Wallace. In the courtyard outside the king's room, the executioners encircle Wallace. He is brutally tortured, but refuses to swear allegiance to Longshanks. Instead, he issues the clarion call of "Freedom!" inspiring his countrymen to fight for and win their independence...<br /><br />With a brilliant array of costumes, vivid battle scenes, and a noble hero at its center, Braveheart is more than just a movie. It's a part of history. It's call for freedom and belief that some things are worth risking life and limb for strikes a cord within every viewer. In fact, the movie led to a revival in nationalistic pride that fueled the successful Scottish independence movement of the 1990s. A thousand years later, the enduring legacy of William Wallace is still transforming the European landscape. And Mel Gibson captures the passion of Wallace with an Academy Award winning masterpiece of a film...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></body></html>

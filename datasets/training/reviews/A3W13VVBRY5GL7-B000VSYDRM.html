<meta name="summary" content="The Emperor's New Nose, Hollow and Unrewarding"></head><body><p>Perfume<br /><br />"Perfume" tells the tale of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, a Parisian baby born to a rather stupid mother, who, assuming him to be yet another stillbirth, literally tosses him into the gutter. He's hired by a tannery and eventually, when a down-on-his-luck perfume maker Giuseppe Baldini notices his incredible gift for scent, Grenouille sets about achieving greatness in his own peculiar manner.<br /><br />The biggest problem with "Perfume" is that it suffers from the ultimate case of The Emperor's New Nose. There's an imperceptible line of demarcation, much like the two mountain paths recurring in the movie, that divides brilliance from dreck, and sadly, "Perfume" hitches its wagon to the latter path, and follows it through to the bitter end.<br /><br />Performance-wise there's nothing going on we haven't seen before, the nearest thing to honest-to-god acting contained in this movie is Alan Rickman's performance as Antoine Richis, troubled father of the beautiful Laura. Sadly, his part is a very small one (as are all parts of this movie not that of its lead character) and his ridiculously over-the-top speech in the closing minutes of the picture negate any sense of affinity or empathy we might have felt for him. Something about how he's going to seep into Grenouille's pores and come shooting out his nose, or something. I'm not making this up.<br /><br />As troubled teen Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, Ben Whishaw is a total nonstarter: he's sort of a cross between Beaker from the Muppet Show and a comatose Hannibal Lecter. His emotional range doesn't stretch past looking either A. bored, or B. slightly turned-on. But then, the screenplay must assume its fair share of the blame: Whishaw does for the most part what he can with a really turgid script. It seems someone forgot to explain to the director and screenplay writing team that this, in fact, is a talkie.<br /><br />The biggest problem with "Perfume" is the disparity between what the overly-explicit visuals would have you believe, and what the screenplay actually tells us. Smellovision hasn't yet been invented so clearly the production design and the camerawork are designed to make us believe that we can indeed smell the many strong odours of Grenouille's Paris. It's going for a sense of lushness and full-on olfactory assault. The screenplay gives us a monotonous one-note Tale O' Woe, and it's in this glaring contrast that the essence of what could have been a stellar piece of cinema is totally and irretrievably lost. We keep searching for a mental connection with the content to match our optical connection with the visuals, and sadly, this never arrives.<br /><br />Don't bother. "Perfume - Story of a Murderer" isn't worth your while. Check out Hugh O' Connor in "The Young Poisoner's Handbook" for a much more satisfying example of sociopathic teens, or something like "Dangerous Liaisons" or "La Reine Margot" if Ye Olde France is your thing.</p></body></html>

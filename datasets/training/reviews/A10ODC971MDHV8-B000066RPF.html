<meta name="summary" content="Monty Python and the Holy Grail"></head><body><p>Perhaps one of the greatest film comedies of all time (certainly for Pythonites), this zany cult classic by the famed Monty Python troupe will leave you gasping for breath and occasionally howling at the hilarious bad taste of certain slapstick sequences. Cleese, Chapman, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Gilliam, and Jones all play multiple roles, combining non-sequitur humor with bloody duels and other pratfalls that parody medieval chivalry and archaic religious sentiment. Somehow, senselessly silly gags like the encounter with a killer rabbit and the Knights Who Say "Ni!" tickle the funny bone no matter how many times you watch. For brilliant, irreverent lunacy, seek the "Holy Grail."</p></body></html>

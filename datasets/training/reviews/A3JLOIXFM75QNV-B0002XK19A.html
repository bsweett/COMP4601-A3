<meta name="summary" content="Slightly better than the first"></head><body><p>While definitely improved, its really not that much more enjoyable than the first. The only difference is, I actually liked Peter Parker in this, though his whininess was constantly grating. Kirsten Dunst was annoying, just like in the first one. The effects are better. The plot is barely improved over the first movie. It was decent, but still not good enough.</p></body></html>

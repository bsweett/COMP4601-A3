Or are they being eaten by the Disney Moster?"  It is a legitimate question, and one that I will answer with one word: CARS.<br /><br />  You may find yourself scratching your head in confusion because I say it is Paxiar's best to date, which would mean it is better than the "Toy Story" films and "Finding Nemo".  The reason this claim has been made is because although "Toy Story" and "Finding Nemo" were amazing, "Cars" succeeds on a few ways that those movies do not.<br /><br />  Let us start with a synopsis.  This movie has an extremely simple premise; a race car with the name "Lightning McQueen" (voiced by Owen Wilson" is living life in the "fast lane".  He is letting life pass him by so that he can be the youngest car to ever win a Piston Cup.  He is on the brink of winning it when by accident he winds up in a redneck town called "Radiatory Springs".  It seems to have frozen in time, and after Mcqueen tears the roads to shreds he is sentenced to community service, and well, these simple minded people of course teach him the point lessons he has failed to learn up to that point.<br /><br />  The story on paper sounds mundane, but it is the visuals that are stunning (even by Pixar's standards) and the characters that bring this tale to life.  What makes this movie so good is that it will touch your heart, and remind you that there is more to life than trying to succeed, and that sometimes slowing down and just taking a drive to look at the scenery is a more satisfying than winning another trophy. It is the kind of movie that children and adults alike can enjoy. It has funny and animated characters for children like "Tow Mater" (Voiced to perfection by Larry the Cable Guy), more serious characters like "Doc" that is embittered, and sober-minded.<br /><br />  While most these characters or characters like them are in other Pixar movies, that are just not as well fleshed out as they here.  Even if we cannot agree with me on this, we can agree that the visuals here are so amazing that you will forget you are watching a "cartoon".  This is one animated movie that will stand the test of time fifty years down the road and will be considered a great classic as well as a milestone in computer animation.<br /><br />  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!!!<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The edge is missing - but not horrible."></head><body><p>The pyschological edge of Hannibal Lecter has all but disappeared in this sequel.  What once was a character that was almost purely a mental figure has now been transformed into an escape artist with almost super-human ability.  That being said, this movie is not bad - but it really has lost it's edge.<p>Julianne Moore is not Jodie Foster - but she does a good job in my opinion.  Foster was a very tough act to follow.<p>I would still recommend this movie - but it is no blockbuster.</p></body></html>

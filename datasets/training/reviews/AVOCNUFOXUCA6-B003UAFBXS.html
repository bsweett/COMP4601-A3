<meta name="summary" content="Not quite what I expected"></head><body><p>When I popped this DVD into my player, I was looking forward to 90 minutes of Sam Raimi-ish horror comedy.  To my surprise, this movie ended up being a character study of an elderly Elvis (maybe) and an elderly black JFK (possibly).  Characterization is usually completely lacking in the horror genre, and I welcome any attempt to flesh out the characters in this type of movie.  But the characterization ended up being tedious and repetitive in parts.  Indeed, this movie slows to a crawl in more than one location.  And ultimately, a movie about Elvis and JFK fighting a mummy in a rest home should never get tedious.  Unfortunately, this movie never quite goes over the top in the way that you'd expect based on the subject matter.<p>Fans of Bruce Campbell will enjoy his excellent (as always) performance.  And no one will be disappointed by the copious extras on this DVD.  For those with surround sound, the sound mix on this disc is first-rate, as well.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Truly Awful"></head><body><p>The 2006 film "Ultraviolet", which was written and directed by Kurt Wimmer, portrays the story of a female vampire named Violet (Milla Jovovich, who may be best remembered for her portrayal of the character Leeloo in the 1997 sci-fi film "The Fifth Element"), who, with other vampires (or as they are called in the film, hemophages), fight government & corporate agents who are determined to destroy them.  The surreal futuristic world of "Ultraviolet" is one in which many people have been infected by a disease that transforms them into hemophages.  Those that are not infected wear large amounts of protective rubber clothing and gas masks (especially soldiers, whose faces are never seen) to avoid being infected.  The point of this film?  Daxus (Nick Chinlund), a seemingly uninfected human in charge, creates clones of himself with which he hopes to destroy the hemophages.  One of the clones, a boy named Six (Cameron Bright), is captured by violet; but instead of destroying him as the other hemophages want her to do, Violet befriends & protects the boy.  Hence, most of this comic-book-like film involves unrealistic martial-arts fighting, lots of weapons, motorcycles, protective gear, an evil corporate boss, an innocent boy and a woman (Violet) who can't decide what hair color she wants as it periodically changes.<br /><br />If you were looking for good acting, an interesting story, well-written dialog, engaging characters and an entertaining sci-fi film, chances are rather high that you won't find any of that in the film "Ultraviolet".  So (not surprisingly), the only rating that I can give to this uninspired & uninteresting film is 1 out of 5 stars.  My only recommendation: if you want to watch this film, either watch it on TV or rent it before you decide to purchase a copy.</p></body></html>

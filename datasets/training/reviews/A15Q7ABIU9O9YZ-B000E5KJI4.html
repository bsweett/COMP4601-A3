John Wayne actually says something like that to William Holden in "The Horse Soldiers." That movie told the tale of a Union raid on the Railway station at . . . somewhere, it might not of been Atlanta. It was a story about the stress between the Doctor, Holden (why are all Doctors so pacifist . . .don't we have any facist Doctors anymore?) and the Hawk Wayne. It's also the answer to the trivia question "In what John Wayne movie set in the 1860's does a jet airplane fly over the blue skies." It also says very little about the Civil War, neither makes any attempt to be accurate and kind of freelances from scene to scene.<p>The point is that no movie made by Hollywood and an army of CPA's is going to risk taking on The Illiad or any other ancient text. It's not supposed to. The Illiad, along with Hamlet, Exodus, Chaucer and probably a 1000 other great stories weren't written for anything but paper. Or in Homer's time, papyrus. Or scrolls. Or whatever.<p>Maya Angelou writes of Oprah Winfrey's Book Club that she (Angelou) didn't like some of the books Winfrey chose 'but at least she got people reading something.'<p>So kudos to the cast of Troy. Interesting story. Did it follow the book written 2000 years ago? Golly. No. But if it sparks some interest . . . if it gets people out of thinking the world begins and ends with the Emmys, X games and MTV, that guy deserves a medal.<p>Brad Pitt is worth seeing just for the benefit of appreciating what a year in a gym can do for you. Eric Bana too. They were all good. It's an interesting tale. If you want to find out the "why," heck, then you go to the library.<p>My only complaint was that I would have liked Brad Pitt's Mom to tell us why he was ONLY VULNERABLE TO A WOUND ON HIS HEEL. That would have been helpful.<p>4 stars. Nice try. Not a bad way to spend a rainy afternoon. Larry Scantlebury.</p></body></html>

They just can't get into their head that if you change one little thing, everything changes. "Next" avoids this problem altogether, by shrinking the margin of travel to two-minutes, for the most part. But I'm getting a little ahead of myself.<br /><br />Story: Nicolas Cage's character apparently can see into the future, which is both a blessing and a curse. He can see a bank robbery and a murder before it happens, and prevent it, saving innocent lives. But since the police can't see the future, they take offence at this mysterious magician seemingly punching people for no apparent reason. But he can also avoid them with this ability, which is how he chooses to live his life. But wait... then the darn government agents have to interfere, asking his to stop a nuclear bomb from going off. However, since his ability seemingly can only go two-minutes, he isn't much help. Until he meets a woman that seemingly amplifies his powers to great lengths.<br /><br />Concept: Pretty darn interesting, and original. His powers also evolve over time, making them and character, and for that matter, the movie rather unpredictable. And while the concept is handled rather well, the movie makes it very confusing for viewers that totally aren't mentally into the movie. But think of his powers this way, he basically can go "Groundhog Day" for two-minutes. Rather original, I think.<br /><br />Good Guys: Nicolas Cage is again amazing in the role, and is really perfect for the role, giving the character added depth and emotion. The character therefore is likable, and you feel for him, even though his background information is left completely out of the picture unlike most 'superpower' movies. Jessica Biel does surprisingly well, sure she doesn't blow you out of the water, and the character is pretty cut and paste, she still does fine with it. And even though Peter Falk is listed as one of the main actors, he has all but a few lines, and is more of a cameo.<br /><br />Bad Guys: Julianne Moore shows off her mean side in this film, and while she was never a bundle of joy, she isn't exactly a caring government agent in this film. Exact opposite, while she's doing her job, the character plays good cop sometimes, her only use for Chris Johnson (Nicolas Cage) is too stop the bad guys, which isn't bad, they just bring up some torture questions in the movie, which I personally could have done without. Definitely not the best of roles for Moore.<br /><br />Her partner however could be even worse, not because he's mean or anything, but thank god he only says a few lines, because he's just a downright pathetic and horrible actor to the nth degree. You cringe everytime you hear him speak. Soap-Opera bad doesn't describe it, it's Sci-Fi channel bad. Pathetic, and a real oversight on the director, and Producer Cage. The terrorist on the other hand are pretty bland, and cardboard. But with the main terrorist's name being "Mr. Smith," did you expect anything else?<br /><br />Effects and Action: There's a bunch of "oh snap!" moments in terms of action in this film. Particularly the jumping over the tracks, and totally awesome hill sequence. That was just amazing, until the part at the bottom, where I noticed a couple of effects that looked about ten years old. But other than that, they rarely fail to disappoint. While they aren't exactly blockbuster, they're pretty good considering the rather low budget.<br /><br />The End: Here's the thing, up until this point, I've thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and was ready and willing for another half an hour, and it looked as if it was heading in that direction, because that's what happened in every other movie like this. They go through the scenario the first time, screw up, try it again, get it right, happy ending. However, with this movie, you're forced to make up the ending on your own. 'But wait, I'm seeing somebody else's story, so I don't have to make up my own.' Well, if you're that type of person, and most of us are, you won't like the ending at all. But apparently, they didn't have the production budget for it, so they cut the movie about 30 minutes short. Sure you'll feel cheated, sure you'll be angry.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is a rather enjoyable popcorn flick, and a great movie to see on TNT or something. It has a great concept, an interesting story, and good characters. However, all these element have their glaring flaws that mar a otherwise great movie. It's still a good movie, just not great. Also, you have to really pay attention to this movie, because you'll get confused very easily if you don't. Chris's power evolves, and sometimes you don't know what is the future, and what is the present, so sometimes you'll be shocked. But if you do pay attention, the movie is actually improved because of those otherwise confusing elements. And I actually would love a sequel to this movie.</p></body></html>

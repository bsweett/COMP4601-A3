It almost threatens to overpower the film, as the Bass titles for "A Walk on the Wild Side" primed us for something that film did not deliver. "Mockingbird" begins delivering in narrative, performance and craftsmanship soon enough, and it does so in beautiful black-and-white cinematography stunningly restored in this DVD transfer.<br /><br />It also delivers a small emotional wallop following the black man's rape trial, when his white attorney (Gregory Peck) leaves a courtroom in defeat and empty save for the blacks packed into the upper gallery. As they rise to their feet, one says to the little girl beside him, "Stand up, child, your father's leaving the coutroom." Their tribute to the white man who defended a black one in a losing cause is unexpectedly moving. That could be said for the film itself.</p></body></html>

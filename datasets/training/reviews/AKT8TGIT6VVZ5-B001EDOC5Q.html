Director Andrew Adamson does a better job here than in the previous film in directing an exciting, heart-pounding rendition of the classic C. S. Lewis tale which stays true in spirit to Lewis' "Chronicles of Narnia", even if this adaptation isn't nearly as faithful as, for example, Peter Jackson's "The Lord of the Rings". Once more Adamson relies on excellent props and other special effects made by the New Zealand-based WETA Workshop (which was the source for the "Lord of the Rings" films too.), but first, and foremost, he is blessed in excellent acting from the children portraying the Pevesnie family: Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy, (Georgie Henley). Not surprisingly, Georgie Henley once more steals almost every scene she is in as the young Lucy. So does Sergio Castellitto (Protector Miraz), who portrays the cynically evil despotic ruler of the Telmarines, while Ben Barnes is quite impressive too as his nephew, the young Prince Caspian X.<br /><br />While a year has passed in wartime World War II London for the Pevesnie children, 1300 years have elapsed in Narnia. One day they are magically transported back, and soon find themselves rescuing a cantankerous dwarf (Peter Dinklage) who fills them in on recent Narnian history. Eventually they come across Prince Caspian too, and join forces, hoping to help the young prince in taking his rightful place as the true successor to his father, not his usurper uncle Miraz. Aided once more by a large band of centaurs, dwarves, badgers, rats, and other Narnian animals, the Pevesnie children are also reunited with the heroic god-like lion Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), as they wage a desperate struggle to free Narnia from Telmarine rule and restore young Prince Caspian to his throne.<br /><br />Devout fans of C. S. Lewis and "The Chronicles of Narnia" will enjoy this spectacular film, which, I note again, is destined to become a cinematic classic. So will countless others who aren't familiar with Lewis' work.</p></body></html>

My wife loved it and I admit I laughed out loud several times myself. I don't know Nia Vardalos from Adam (or Eve), but I remember John Corbett from his role as Chris on _Northern Exposure_ -- and I've seen Lainie Kazan and Michael Constantine in scores of films over the year. And they were all pretty good. HOWEVER: This thing would have been a lot more believable if they had omitted the computers and Ian's SUV and set it in the mid-1950s instead of the late `90s. I find it *very* difficult to believe there could still be such an insular, inbred, hyper-ethnic extended family existing in urban America today, especially running a couple of successful businesses in a major city. The social equivalent here in south Louisiana would be the old Acadian families with a dozen kids, all of whom speak only Cajun French -- but they're virtually extinct, the subject of reminiscence. Any folks like that these days are *way* down the bayou, not living and working in a big city. Even my son's Vietnamese mother-in-law, who only arrived here to live with her daughter a couple of years, is nothing remotely like the black-clad, hunched mama from Greece. Yeah, I'm probably being too logical in evaluating what is in essence a fairy tale, but the lively writing aside, I had trouble keeping my eyebrows lowered.</p></body></html>

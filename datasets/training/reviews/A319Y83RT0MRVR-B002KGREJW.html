The movie is heartwarming, without being sugarcoated; it's sweet without being saccharine.<br /><br />Exiting the movie theater, I overheard a woman say that Little Miss Sunshine was real. I agree. The movie might not have the most common plot or the most ordinary characters, but its dysfunctional family and a sense of failure resonate with all of us. This movie does not follow a formula and it doesn't try to impress you with any of the traditional Hollywood gimmicks; instead it tells a story the way it's meant to be told - unbegrudgingly and unhinderingly. Its allure is that it's fresh, funny, and innocent, even when profanities are being uttered left and right.<br /><br />What is most redeeming about this movie, however, are the characters and the superb cast of actors who play them. If one look at the cast reveals a cast full of B movie stars that have never made it big, then these talented people are extremely misjudged and underpaid. Steve Carrell, who arguably is no longer a B movie star after the 40-year-old Virgin crossed the $100 million at the box-office, is incredibly convincing as Frank, the uncle who attempted to commit suicide because of an unrequited homosexual love. Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense, In Her Shoes) delivers Sheryl, a mother trying to keep her family together, who is at her wits' ends about the life;s failures, so distinctively that it's a wonder if Collette is actually acting or portraying her own experience. Alan Arkin (Jacob the Liar, Gattaca)'s Grandpa is one of the best forefathers on screen. Seeing Paul Dano (The Girl Next Door, Taking Lives) as Dwayne one is amazed and belittled by Dano's tremedous talent. Dano, who spends most of the movie mimicking and writing his lines on a notepad, is an exceptionally talented young man and a promising actor. Furthermore, Greg Kinnear (As Good As it Gets, You've Got Mail) has one of the best performances of his life as Richard, the father who invented a 9 Step Program to winning, but can't seem to win in life himself.<br /><br />Yet, what this movie needed was a strong heroine, a girl who isn't waif thin; a girl who has the charm and charisma to steal the show and delight us and it could have no one better than Abigail Breslin (The Signs, Raising Helen), who plays Olive, the little girl who is eligible to compete in Little Miss Sunshine, a California beauty pageant for 6- to 7-year-old girls. Breslin is a girl with a very, very bright future. She isn't a supermodel, but she is better - more human and more real.<br /><br />The last ten minutes of this movie will delight, surprise, and entertain you. The rest of the moviegoers in my theater laughed until their hands could clap no longer and their faces were full of glee after the movie ended. The movie brought a childhood smile, one of true wonderment and enjoyment to everyone's face.<br /><br />If you can make people laugh that hard about everybody's worse fear, you don't only have a comedy, you've got a true classic.<br /><br />Little Miss Sunshine is a winner, but not because it tries and never gives up. It's a winner in the truest sense of the word - it warms your heart and entertains you until the very last credit rolls.</p></body></html>

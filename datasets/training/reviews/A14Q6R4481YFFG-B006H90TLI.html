<meta name="summary" content="Where's the professionalism?"></head><body><p>To tell the truth, I was a little disappointed in Sheriff Bell.  No one forced him to become a lawman, to confront evil as a business.  I don't mind the movie's post-modernism (evil sometimes triumphs) or its existentialism (things happen randomly) but the lack of professionalism is just unacceptable.*<br /><br />Anyhow, a good movie if you like the genre, or the Coen Brothers.  It's got a lot of Fargo in it, a lot of Blood Simple too.  But it's its own thing.<br /><br />*  I do recognize the fact that a professionalism is necessarily a belief in duty, and postmordernism would posit that a belief in duty (e.g., Marshall Kane in "High Noon") is pointless or even should be attacked as outmoded, not useful and superstitious.  Postmodernists are a grim bunch.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A cold night..."></head><body><p>I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this film, mainly because it received such a cold shoulder from critics and awards bodies alike, despite the fact that it has such a high pedigree and the subject matter is beyond baity.  Still, I wanted to see it and so I indulged my curiosity the other night to a rather surprising effect.<br /><br />I expected to be bored stiff and or unengaged and what I found was a much tighter and much more involved film than I expected.<br /><br />That isn't to say it isn't without flaws, but it certainly isn't without merit either.<br /><br />`The Good Shepherd' tells the story of one of the CIA's founding fathers, Edward Wilson.  Wilson is a sharp young man who is corralled into a very different and guarded lifestyle after being inducted into the CIA.  The timeframe of the film spans from 1939, where Wilson becomes a member of the Skull and Bones, all the way to 1961, where the Bay of Pigs plays a pivotal role in Wilson's overall development.  Taking his time to flesh out certain aspects of Wilson's life, Director Robert DeNiro (yes, THAT Robert DeNiro) allows us to come to know who this man was, even if the guarded nature of his persona makes him appear a mystery most times.  I loved the progressive nature of the film and the way that the film was so sharply edited to find a sense of tension amidst a rather cold and slow moving premise (yes, this film is void of any real action).  Still, one feels the overwhelming intensity that accompanies such a complicated lifestyle.<br /><br />To all that I admired, I would be amiss if I didn't criticize the film in parts.  For starters, Angelina Jolie is completely miscast here and truly squanders her talent.  I mean, she brings NOTHING to the table and seems completely awkward in every scene she's in.  I also found the big reveal surrounding Wilson's father to be anticlimactic and underwhelming.  I loved the angle revolving around The Bay of Pigs and Wilson's connection, and I felt that the film's finale was expertly played (if not a tad soap operatic in tone), but the emotional connection one was supposed to make between Wilson's actions and those of his father aren't as impactful as I would have wanted.<br /><br />There is a balance necessary in order to make a film's cold nature feel relatable, and little touches are needed to bring us there.  `The Good Shepherd' is far more engaging than some will suggest, but it lacks those touches to make it feel poignant to the audience.<br /><br />Still, I highly recommend seeing this; even though I understand why most won't like it.</p></body></html>

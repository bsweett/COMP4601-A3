<meta name="summary" content="Very Well Done, but reminds us how silly the masses are"></head><body><p>Let me start by saying I think the idea of a Queen in modern times is a bit outdated and silly, however this film reminds us of something even MORE SILLY.... and that is the modern fascination of the general public over celebrities.<br /><br />It is amazing and unbelievable to me that the media has been able to generate such a "mythological importance" to Princess Diana that people in the general public who of course never knew her will camp out in the streets, cry and mourn for a literal stranger they have only seen in the news.<br /><br />It's a weird modern mass media phenomenon.<br /><br />This film reminds me of how the Queen was unfairly criticized by the media and public over not seeming emotional enough about Diana's death.<br /><br />Not to detract from Diana, buts lets face reality....... it's a Cinderella story gone bad.<br /><br />She was an immature girl who married into royalty, never appreciated the responsibility of the role and thus like a spoiled kid lashed out at the century old establishment.<br />Then she tried to establish her own identity as a caring person by being involved with humanitarian efforts while partying it up with controversial figures who she knew would cast a poor light on Mother England.<br /><br />I don't dislike Diana, but I do question the "saint-like" mythology that has been generated about her while the general public conveniently forgets the reality of who she was and what she did.</p></body></html>

I received a version that wouldn't play the first few times I tried, then finally played, and stopped dead 5 minutes from the end.  Gee, I wonder how it ends!<br /><br />This is a masterfully crafted murder mystery.  I am an iconoclast, and this is an icon, so I could be expected to criticize it and give it a poor rating.  No, this one deserves the best.<br /><br />It is more than just a scary shower scene.  The story is strong.  It's not simply a horror flick.  And if it is the first time you're seeing it, there are some great surprises in store.  If it is not the first time you're seeing it, you will remember it for life.  Somehow I have trouble believing that anyone still hasn't seen Psycho, and that anyone doesn't know what is really up at the Bates Motel.</p></body></html>

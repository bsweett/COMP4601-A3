However, what I got was a mess of a movie and very, very, very mixed performances. I tried to justify this movie's shortfalls by focusing on its positives; however, the balance does not tip, it falls apart!!<br /><br />First of all, the visual effects in this movie are horrible. It has a posted budget of $100 million, and I can't help but wonder where all the money went and how many starving children could have been fed and clothed. Bad special effects, however, cannot compare to the wreck that is Keanu Reeves. He is a tragedy of epic proportions, evoking feeling of sickness and uncontrollable laughter all at once! It is IMPOSSIBLE to take him seriously. I can't think about it anymore.<br /><br />The positives are very positive, however. The storyline is interesting, intriguing, and attention holding; again, this only goes so far. Also, the supporting cast is superb. Djimon Hounsou and Tilda Swinton are excellent in their roles and almost make you forget about the aforementioned tragedy (Reeves, for those who are lost). However, it is Rachel Weisz that makes this film bearable. She is beautiful, mysterious, and involving. I have read so many reviews that say she was too good for this film, and they were right.<br /><br />Bottom line: you will beg for your 2 hours back, but Hounsou, Swinton, and Weiss (especially) soften the blow.</p></body></html>

If it doesn't make you want to trade in your SUV for a Mini Cooper, I don't know what would.<br />In between the ad portions for this car is a pretty good caper movie, a remake really of a British version of the same basic story, which starred Michael Caine, based on a double cross (by the Edward Norton character) plot.<br />The hijack scenes that were filmed in the Chinese Theater district of Hollywood are amazing as this area is always jammed with tourists. The logistics and planning necessary to pull these scenes off must have been almost insurmountable; yet they play out so naturally as to appear seamless.<br />"The Italian Job" is fun, sexy, noisy and fast paced. I can think of a lot worse ways to spend a couple of hours.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="More Vampires to be defeated"></head><body><p>For the first major motion picture of a Marvel Super Hero, the Comic book Enterprise chose Blade.  Surprisingly, he is a very low key, lesser-known `anti-hero' who never even had his own comic book.  Maybe that was the trick; use a hero that no one knew as a hero so the stigma of comic books wouldn't taint the popularity.  Let them find out he was born from the comic books AFTER they see the movie and like it.  Now, after several Marvel Character adaptations, including Spider-Man, Daredevil, Hulk, X-Men and the soon be released Elektra and Fantastic Four, Blade has pulled through well with two movies and a third one just released.  He is the only character so far to get three movies.  But soon that will change when Spider-Man and X-Men get their third installments.<br /><br />As for Blade's second movie he takes on a new breed of Vampires that are tougher to kill and even tougher to stomach when they are finally defeated.  An astute friend of mine made the comparison; `Blade 2 is to Blade what Aliens is to Alien...more of them and more dangerous', an accurate comparison.  There is even a Special Forces group of Vampires that Blade cautiously teams up with to take them on, because apparently, the current vampires don't want to be killed off by the next evolution of their own kind.  Recruiting the `Day Walker' seems to be their best choice.  If he gets killed in the process, so be it, one less problem for them to deal with.<br /><br />If there was any hint of character development in the first movie, this one totally side steps it and goes straight for the adrenaline rush.  With scads of vampires to be killed in overblown spectacles of blood and illuminating effects, lots of ammunition and explosives to be set off and plenty of faces to be smacked around by Blade's wheel kicks, not to mention snide remarks made between Ron Perlman's character and Blade, we certainly get the sense that this movie was created to wow us, and wow us it does.  No shortage in action and a good plot make this a very worthy sequel that actually shows what could be done when comic book characters are developed to really show their ability.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Thought Provoking Film"></head><body><p>There has been a wide discussion of the story of the film so I will not go into a lot of detail in that regard.  The Queen is a well acted, thought provoking film.  I cannot comment on what might have been left out, was invented or compressed to tell the story of the Royal family in the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana but what we do see rings true with the information that is generally known.  The performance by Helen Mirren is Oscar caliber; my test for a performance is how convinced I am that the actor has become the role and Ms. Mirren is Queen Elizabeth II.  Indeed, the entire cast is superb.  Michael Sheen is terrific as Tony Blair and expresses a good range of emotion dealing sternly with his staff, diplomatically with the Queen and coping with family life.  James Cromwell is also good as Prince Philip exhibiting perhaps the ultimate stiff upper lip attitude of the English upper class. Equally good is Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mother, who is most concerned, so it seems that Diana's public funeral is being based off her own.  Alex Jennings makes an interesting Prince Charles; although he does not look a lot like Charles he worked into his performance the Prince's mannerisms<br /><br />The audience is treated to what amounts to the daily life of the Queen on summer holiday at the family estate at Balmoral.  This otherwise peaceful retreat is interrupted by the death of Princess Diana on August 30, 1997 and becomes a chronological telling of the events that occurs up to her funeral.  The film does not take a point-of-view and does not present very much about Princess Diana other than glimpses of her public life, which allows us to focus on how the Royal family dealt with her death.  It is going on ten years since the events depicted in the film occurred giving all of us a better perspective on what happened.  At the time, the Royal family came under harsh criticism for their perceived lack of reaction to Princess Diana's death; this film provides all sides and allows us to better understand the Queen and her reaction first to the death of the princess and then to the criticism of her conduct.<br /><br />The episode of the stag in the film is one of the events that may be fictional but it serves to remind us that Princess Diana, like the stag, was hunted for her beauty.  The Queen makes this connection in the film and so her attempt to shoo the animal away when she encounters it and her quiet sorrow when he is killed.  I think that one comes away with a better understanding of Queen Elizabeth, and one can see the influence of past generations - that of her grandmother Queen Mary - in her attitude toward the public life that she inherited from her father.  The Queen is a thought provoking film that needs to be seen.</p></body></html>

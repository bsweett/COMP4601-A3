<meta name="summary" content="A true modern fantasy masterpiece!"></head><body><p>Wow! This movie is truly exceptional. The characters pull directly from the first movie and move nicely along into the second, seamlessly.<br />All is exceptionally well done. The special effects, costumes, sound, music, plot... everything.<br />This would certainly be best in a theater, however I rented and boy was I sorry I didn't go to see it while it was playing.<br />Definitely for adults, language and violence are strong themed here. But if you're an adult who likes strong action/fantasy movies then this is the one for you. Without a doubt, one of my more recent favorites.<br />Rent it.... you won't be sorry.</p></body></html>

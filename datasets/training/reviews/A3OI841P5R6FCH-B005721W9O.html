It even goes after the actor's love/hate relationships with each other. Much like the original Trek crew's general dislike of William Shatner, the broken-down thespians of "GalaxyQuest" don't particularly care for the attitude of the `captain' (Tim Allen). Then there's the `crushy, chompy things' scene that rags on space opera shows' more implausible plot devices &amp; gimmicks used to add suspense to the adventure. There's even a `Thermian' language track (a very annoying language to listen to after 30 seconds, BTW), which I'm sure is a take-off of the unbelievable popularity of the Klingon tongue; a language that's actually taught at some colleges no less!<p>Although `Star Trek' is never mentioned in the movie or `making of' documentary, its influence can definitely be seen, especially by one who's immersed him/herself in the sci-fi/space opera culture, and has hit a few geek conventions. The con clips of the "Galaxy Quest" show had the exact look and style of the original series episodes. The cardboard bridge, the paper-mache rocks that made up the `planetbound' scenes- it's all too familiar to the hardcore Trekkie. They even take a shot at the NextGen show, with a (then) twelve-year-old flying the ship a la Wesley Crusher! And the NSEA Protector looks like it could fit right in with any other ship in the UFP's Starfleet. All in all, "Galaxy Quest" is a really good poke at `Trek's look and style, yet done in a way that also pays tribute to the show and its subsequent space-opera competitors &amp; spin-offs.<p>I was also amazed by make-up/creature FX designer Stan Winston's work on this flick. Winston combines the various E.T.s' other-worldly `realism' with a just a smidge of cartoonish Muppet-style silliness to make them look real, yet unreal at the same time. General Sarris and his minions exemplified this look to a T: threateningly deadly, yet yet a tad silly-looking, too. The pig-lizard thingy and the Thermians' `true' appearances also displayed a neat combo of strange and ridiculous.<p>As for features &amp; extras, this offering has all that one would pretty much expect from a big-budget digital video release. The picture &amp; sound clarity are top-notch. And of course it's in widescreen so you can see the whole thing without missing what's on the right and left. Then there's the usual theatrical trailer &amp; cast/crew career bios &amp; production notes thrown in. Of course, ther's also those things that aren't always present in every DVD release, such as outtakes, cut scenes, and a secondary dialogue track (the aforementioned Thermian dub). I found most of the cut scenes rather amusing, and I was disappointed that many of them weren't restored to the movie itself. Some of them, however, had incomplete CGI effects, and a few were alternate scenes with different outcomes from what was shown in the movie, which likely made it hard for the DreamWorks powers-that-be to pick &amp; choose between what should be restored and what should not. Oh well...<p>`Late</p></body></html>

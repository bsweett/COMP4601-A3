<meta name="summary" content="Mindless zombie exploitation entertainment!"></head><body><p>Bruce Willis and his cohorts have unleased a deadly gas into the atmosphere--one that rots away at the flesh, and turns the populace into cannibalistic monsters.  Caught in this nightmare is Cherry Darling, a go-go (not cry-cry) dancer who loses a leg and gains some self-respect; a mysterious truck driver named El Wray, who is handy with a gun and never misses; the local sheriff who's been around the block and is rather weary of it; the local barbeque chef who just wants to make his recipe the best he possibly can; and the frantic mother who's just trying to save her child from her sadistic husband.  Together, they must combat these hordes of zombies before the zombies eat them.<br /><br />That's basically it.  Never fear, though--"Planet Terror" isn't meant to be anything more than exploitation fun, which is what makes it so tantalyzingly enjoyable.  A stellar cast (Rose McGowan, Freddie Rodriguez, Michael Biehn, Jeff Fahey, Josh Brolin, Marley Shelton) leads the way, with wonderful supporting roles from Willis, Michael Parks, Tom Savini, Quentin Tarantino, and Robert Rodriguez's own son providing ample and talented back-up.  The writing is crisp; the action flows along smoothly.  There's little pondering about WHY people are becoming zombies; there's no room and no need for it in a movie of this sort.  This is an exploitation movie, and as such is not meant to be thought-provoking, only chilling.  You'll cringe in spots; yes, even you, the die-hard horror movie fans, will squirm in your seats.<br /><br />A note about "Grindhouse" overall.  Tarantino's half, "Death Proof," was a more serious, thoughtful effort; while I admire Tarantino, and absolutely love his contribution, Rodriguez's would have to be my favorite half.  I'm not sure why...maybe because it's just good fun.  For those of you who, like me, saw the movie in theaters, you'll be happy to note that the scratches are still here; the missing scene is thankfully still missing (I was upset that Tarantino put the "lap dance" scene back in "Death Proof," but it's all for the best, I suppose); and the "Machete" preview has been tacked onto the beginning of the movie.  Rodriguez also makes mention, in the bonus features (well worth watching, by the way), of a future double-disc "Grindhouse" release...so hopefully the rest of the mock-previews will be included there.  It'd be great to see this feature in its entirety.  If nothing else, these seperate releases help us view the movies on their own terms; both live up to their hype (and, in many instances, surpass them).  So go ahead and buy them individually; I did.  And I'll buy the "Grindhouse" feature when IT comes out.  Because, let's face it--these are just two great movies.</p></body></html>

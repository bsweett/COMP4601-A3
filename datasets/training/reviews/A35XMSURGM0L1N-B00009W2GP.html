<meta name="summary" content="Less fighting, more thought"></head><body><p>The Matrix Revolutions is the third and final part of the Matrix trilogy and more the second part of the Matrix II. This time there is less fighting martial art style but more SF fighting between machines. It all looks superb again of course. In the second movie you could sometimes see that the characters fighting were computer graphics instead of real people but not so now, making it looking more real; even for a SF. <p>We finally see the end of the story, but like in all the Matrix movies, makes us think again too. Does it start all over again? or not? <p>You have to see this if you have seen the first two and are interested in the story, you will not be dissappointed!</p></body></html>

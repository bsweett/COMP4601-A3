<meta name="summary" content="SEMI-SPOOKY REMAKE OF SUPERIOR JAPANESE FLICK"></head><body><p>A dark dimension is explored in the surprise hit THE RING (DreamWorks remake of the much superior Japanese RINGU (also available in DVD from DreamWorks).  Thes plot -- very urban legendy, non-sensical, non-linear and non-logical -- is about a whispered tale regarding a nightmarish video that kills the viewer seven days after watching it. When four teenagers die after seeing such a tape, a reporter -- a terrific Naomi Watts -- tracks it down and, uh oh, watches it.  Now she has only a week to unravel the mystery and maybe, just maybe, figure out a way to stay alive.  Whew!  You will be afraid of your VCR.</p></body></html>

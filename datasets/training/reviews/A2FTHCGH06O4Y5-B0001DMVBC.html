Its nightmarish script fearlessly puts the characters into what must have been extraordinarily difficult-to-write scenes and does not cop out.<br /><br />Sadly, I hated it.  Perhaps I was not expecting to be so thoroughly excoriated, for the whole thing is like watching a train wreck.  All of these people messing up their lives (especially the cop) -- sheesh!  I had to keep stopping it about every five minutes just to cool off and yell at the TV set!<br /><br />I must say the filmmakers did a superb job with the aspects of Iranian culture that found their way into the film:  very convicing.  All the actors who speak Farsi are clearly Iranian, and even the furniture in the house is bona fide Isfahan.  The only off-note is Kingsley's frequently horrendous pronunciation, which, given the amount of time he reportedly devotes to developing his roles, is something he should be faulted with.<br /><br />One thing that kind of annoyed me about the movie was the realization, about midway through, that the tax angle of it didn't make any sense.<br /><br />If the woman owed $500 in taxes on a $100,000+ home and the government really did seize it in order to pay the bill, the woman would have then been given about $99,500 in change, meaning that she wouldn't have had to sleep in her car and could have hired a proper lawyer.  When this dawned on me, the rest of the movie lost a lot of its punch.<br /><br />Lastly, I don't think the fog motif worked very well:  it was heavy-handed and annoying.</p></body></html>

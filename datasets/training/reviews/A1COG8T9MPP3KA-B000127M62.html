I have enjoyed &quot;Friday The 13th&quot; films however. Freddy as a character does nothing for me. However I like Jason and even own Jason action figures. This was Freddy's movie. Freddy was given better scenes, if that is saying much. Also, Freddy's makeup was much better than the makeup job on Jason.<br />What is up with the annoying woman who played Jason's mother? She didn't even look like Betsy Palmer. I had to laugh at the kids with their glowsticks at the rave, and the cheesy dancing to the cheesy music. Also, The blood looks like red syrup. Why is it in all these movies they perceive psychiatric wards as places were people wander around in strait jackets and drooling?When they showed Jason as a child, what was up with the bad sound dubbing? What kind of kid makes those annoying whimpering noises?. I hear next they are considering adding Ash (Evil Dead) into the fight. UGH.</p></body></html>

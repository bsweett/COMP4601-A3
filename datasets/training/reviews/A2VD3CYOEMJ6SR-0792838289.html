<meta name="summary" content="the better version"></head><body><p>This version is far superior to the ill advised attempt at a remake. The original is more suspenseful than the remake. If you decide you want to see both, even though the endings are not identical, I recommend that you see this version first because the remake has enough similarities to ruin the suspense. Frank Sinatra portrays a Korean war veteran named Bennet Marco who has nightmares about brainwashing with fellow platoon member Raymond Shaw, played by Lawrence Harvey, killing companions upon the order of their captors. The dream sequences are totally surreal, an aspect missing from the remake. Shaw is highly decorated war hero who is dominated by his mother (Angela Lansbury).<br /><br />This domineering mother is married to her second husband, a United States senator who is candidate for vice president of the United States. The plot revolves around attempts of Lansbury's character to make her husband president. Is she just a woman of blind ambition or, is there a much more sinister aspect to the attempt? Meanwhile, Marco (Sinatra's character) seems to be getting a grip and begins to piece together the fact that there is a dangerous plot going on. If I say much more, I will give too much away but, suffice it to say that her son's having been brainwashed plays an integral part in her machinations.<br /><br />In the remake, the brainwashed son, rather than his step father, is the candidate. The remake's version just does not work as well. It is much more plausible that a brainwashed, at times zombie like tool of clever conspirators can be manipulated to be part of a plot rather than being the actual candidate himeslf. Also, the difference in roles played by this character in the two versions leads to a much more satisfying ending in the original. I recommend the original highly. At best, my recommendation for the remake is lukewarm.</p></body></html>

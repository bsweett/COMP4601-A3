Perhaps it was just an unfortunate coincidence that the two films, both are stop-motion animation, came out during the same time. Both films are great and award-worthy (W&G won the "Best Animated Feature" Oscar). Too bad this film wasn't held back until 2006 when it almost would've been guaranteed the award.<br /><br />Johnny Depp voices the prim and proper Victor who is to be married to Victoria (voiced by Emily Watson). Their scheming parents who hope to exploit each other's fortunes, both of which are already spent, arrange the marriage. But on the day of the wedding Victor loses the wedding ring. He finds it in a dark foreboding forest... on the finger of a corpse. Now he must marry the Corpse Bride who is voiced by Helena Bonham Carter. Meanwhile Victoria is being courted by the wealthy (or is he?) yet morally bankrupt Lord Barkis. Soon Victor and the Corpse Bride go to the Land of the Dead to find out how to end their engagement but things become even more complicated when she develops feelings for him. All of this leads to a climactic confrontation between the living and the deceased.<br /><br />The voice cast also includes Tracey Ullman in two roles, Joanna Lumley as Maudeline Everglot, Albert Finney as Finis Everglot, Christopher Lee as Pastor Galswells and Danny Elfman as Bone Jangles. Although not quite the masterpiece that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AIRUOU">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a> is, Corpse Bride is a cult classic in its own right. It utilizes Tim Burton's gothic sensibilities and his love of macabre humor. It's a stop-motion world of wonder and horror.</p></body></html>

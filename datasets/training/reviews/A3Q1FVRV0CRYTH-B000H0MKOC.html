<meta name="summary" content=""Can Brad Pitt blow smoke rings?""></head><body><p>`Thank You for Smoking' is one of the funniest and freshest comedies I've seen in a long time.  It's smart and witty and capitalizes on its assets brilliantly, leading Aaron Eckhart to what has to be is greatest performance to date (a Golden Globe nod should be a lock at this point).  As Nick Naylor, Eckhart is smart, effective and confident as the voice behind big tobacco.  He's so into his job that he even goes as far as to somewhat promote smoking to his son's elementary class.  Nick regularly meets with his fellow lobbyists (David Koechner & Maria Bello) for lunch, donning the name MOD squad (merchants of death), where they discuss and or compete for the greatest death count.<br /><br />When Nick becomes involved with a reporter (Katie Holmes at her most delicious...screw you Tom Cruise) things slowly spiral out of control, and as his son (Cameron Bright) becomes all the more interested in his fathers line of work Nick begins to wonder if he's really setting the right example for his son.  He goes from shameless to selfless by the end of the film, but he does it all with his confident yet cocky demeanor.  The film was a riot, I mean utterly hysterical from start to finish (Rob Lowe was brilliant as the Asian obsessed motion picture tycoon...I mean that whole Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones discussion was priceless), and it was original enough to deem itself worthy of multiple viewings.  A wonderful surprise...highly recommended.</p></body></html>

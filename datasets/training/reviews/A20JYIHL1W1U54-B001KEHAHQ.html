<meta name="summary" content="Clouseau Returns in Good Form"></head><body><p>Steve Martin returns in one of the best cinematic roles ever created. Inspector Clouseau and his antics have always been the catalyst for outrageous mayhem and fun. This is true to form from Peter Sellers' approach to the role. That is what makes this film so successful and funny. Steve Martin is the third actor to portray Clouseau (the fourth if you include Roger Moore's appearance in CURSE OF THE PINK PANTHER in which Moore may or may not have been Clouseau) on screen. Alan Arkin played him in 1968's INSPECTOR CLOUSEAU in an intentionally dry fashion. Martin returns to Maurice Richlin's character as honed by Sellers and that seems to work very well here. Christophe Beck's score is admirable and he has Henry Mancini's Pink Panther Theme down in a robust elegiac form.</p></body></html>

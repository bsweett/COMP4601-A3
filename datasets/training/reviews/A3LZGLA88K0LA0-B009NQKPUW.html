<meta name="summary" content="RIDLEY GIVES US ANOTHER ALIEN WORLD"></head><body><p>Ridley Scott takes us once again on a dark journey to an alien planet that may be even darker than ALIEN.  Not only is the planet ominous and foreboding, but the space vehicle itself offers little refuge from the outside world.<br />Initially planned as a prequel to the ALIEN franchise, Scott decided to explore the origin of man, constructing a bold scenario to offer one possibility.  Parts of the script seem convoluted and while Noomi Rapace generates some thespian fireworks, Sigourney Weaver's Ripley is too iconic to compare.<br />PROMETHEUS  is a visually stunning movie and the creature effects are fascinating and repulsive.  Michael Fassbender as the android David is excellent and Charlize Theron oozes ice as the evil corporate entity.  Logan Michael Green and Idris Elba lend good support, while Guy Pearce is unrecognizable in a small but pivotal role.<br />Two more PROMETHEUS films are planned which may answer some of the unanswered questions in this film.<br />PROMETHEUS is good film making that is also thought-provoking.</p></body></html>

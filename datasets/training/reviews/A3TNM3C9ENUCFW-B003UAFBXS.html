The idea of Elvis being alive and well (having traded places with an impersonator for want of a peaceful life free from the trappings of fame), and ending up dishevelled, and more than a little cynical in a crumbling Texas rest home certainly scores on the originality front, but thats about it really.. The only person who of course believes him is Ossie Davis as the ex president JFK, personified as an old black man, after the government had him "dyed" to aid the cover up, and the two men set about solving a mystery that is claiming the lives of the rest home residents. What could have been an intentionally camp comedy/horror with a side order of pathos, is sadly lacking in too many areas to be memorable. The director has obviously tried to incorporate some poignant drama and side comment about old age, forgotten relatives, and rest homes, but whereas this is a nice idea, it gets lost in the morass of plot ideas that fall over each other throughout the movie. Unlike "Army of Darkness" it's difficult to really catagorize this movie, and as it trys to be too many things, it ends up being none, the comedy aspect tepid and dilute at best. Bubba Hotep is actually a reincarnated Cowboy Mummy roaming the run down halls looking for lost souls after he was stolen from a museum, and the bus he was on crashed in a river near (you guessed it) the rest home where the movie is set. What must have appeared to be a "good idea" on paper, just isn't - the end product is niether scary, tense, or really very funny, and that's a real shame. I desperately wanted to like this movie more, but I have to say they are many many better ways to spend 92 minutes. Quite a lot of extra's on the DVD add some interest, but rent before you buy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="way over the top - or should I say "serving it"?"></head><body><p>While the first two parts of this trilogy easily allowed me to suspend my disbelief and enter the most bizarre mind imaginable, this last one is so graphic and unsubtle that I kept saying to myself, "oh c'mon."  It seemed to me that this film did not have anything to add - afterall, how can you surpass "Silence"? - so it just got more graphically grotesque, in particular the final cooking scene.  Then Lector is so brazen and nonchalant, toying with those who are pursuing him and barely escaping, that it is unconvincing.<br /><br />Clarice develops, as she is older and disillusioned.  Moore is a truly wonderful actress, so empathetic and believable.  It really is a pity that the script is so weak, as this could have been a great film based more on her - and the way her career is messed up - than Hopkins cunning and skill at killing (and eating).  The addition of Oldman does not fail completely, but his personality is somewhat undeveloped, though the way he lures Lector to him is quite subtle.<br /><br />So this film has its good moments, just not nearly as good as it could have been with a better script.<br /><br />Recommended with these caveats in mind, but only fans of Lector will want to own this.</p></body></html>

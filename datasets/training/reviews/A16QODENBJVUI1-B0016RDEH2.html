<meta name="summary" content="One of the two or three finest fantasy films ever made - an utter masterpiece"></head><body><p>A few reviewers previous to mine have stated that this isn't as good as many have insisted that it is.  On one level I agree:  it is even better than the large host of avid reviewers have said.  One has to go all the way back to 1946 and Jean Cocteau's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST to find a grown up fantasy film of such power and beauty.  To call this a masterpiece in reality is to engage in banalities.  It is more than that:  it is the touchstone for all future efforts at grown up fantasy.  I don't want to demean THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, but that was at its heart a film more for kids than adults.  I fully endorse showing it to all but the most sensitive young children.  But PAN'S LABYRINTH should be restricted to adults only.<br /><br />The film is set around the time of the allied invasion of Normandy, several years after the victory of the fascists over the leftists in the Spanish Civil War.  Ofelia is a young girl whose mother is traveling to a remote area of Spain where her husband, the brutal military leader Capit&aacute;n Vidal is engaged in his task of suppressing the resistance that has refused to acknowledge the fascist regime in Spain.  He is on every level a wretched man, focused entirely on appearance and on producing a male heir and otherwise oblivious of the needs of Ofelia's mother, who is suffering a difficult pregnancy.<br /><br />Ofelia is a reader of books, many of them fairy or folk tales.  Very early in the film she finds herself entering a fairy tale of her own when she sees a praying mantis that she imagines is a fairy and which turns out to be, in fact, a fairy tale.  The fairy leads her through a nearby maze to an entrance to an underground staircase at the bottom of which she encounters a rather gruesome fawn who informs her that she is in fact the daughter of an underground king and is in fact immortal.  He gives her a book of blank pages that he tells her will show her what tasks she must complete in order to return to her parents and her kingdom.<br /><br />The most interesting thing to me about Ofelia's story is that while one is tempted to read this as an attempt to escape from the hellishness of her life under Capit&aacute;n Vidal, nowhere is there a hint that her adventures occur merely in her head.  The closest one comes to anything like this is the very end, where Capit&aacute;n Vidal sees Ofelia, whom we have seen talking to the fawn.  While we can see the fawn, Vidal cannot.  But it is surely not a stretch to imagine that she could see it while he could not, especially given the fact that she was able to enter the entrance to the stairway via a route not accessible to Vidal.  In other words, we are not supposed to be reading her descendence to her previous home as metaphorically escapist, even if it literally is so.<br /><br />This is a gruesome film.  It is an interesting combination of horribly realistic events combined with nightmarish fantasy scenes.  Vidal is far more monstrous than any of the fantasy creatures Ofelia encounters.  He has a tendency towards violence and cruelty.  He shoots people with only the slightest provocation and does not hesitate to torture suspects with his bare hands.  The tasks that Ofelia are asked to complete are hardly more terrible than what she has to endure living under Vidal's roof.  Despite all the horrors, however, despite all the tragic events in the film, the movie has a wonderfully happy ending that does not feel tacked on.  Rather, it feels like just compensation for all the wretched events in the film.<br /><br />The cast is wonderful though with one exception I do not think I've seen any of the performers in any previous film.  Ivana Baquero is extraordinary as Ofelia.  She has a magnificent presence throughout the film and recalls some of the finest child actresses of the past few decades, including Jodie Foster, Natalie Portman, and Anna Paquin.  Sergi L&oacute;pez is oppressively dominating as Vidal.  He easily goes down as one of the most evil characters I've ever witnessed on film and his final moment, in which the worst vengeance is brought upon him, seems completely just.  Maribel Verd&uacute; plays Mercedes, the head housekeeper who befriends Ofelia and who is an informant to the resistence in the mountains.  I mentioned above that I had seen only one performer before.  That is Doug Jones, who has carved an interesting niche in film.  Initially a professional mime, Jones gradually has taken a number of fascinating roles requiring unusual degrees of physical expression.  I first became aware of him in the famous Emmy-nominated episode of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER entitled "Hush, where he played one of the Gentlemen.  But Jones will be familiar to most film fans from his role of Abe Sapien in Guillermo del Toro's film HELLBOY, a role he is reprising for HELLBOY 2.  In PAN'S LABYRINTH Jones plays two roles, the fawn and the pale monster whose eyes are in his hands.  Both characters are unforgettable (much like the Gentlemen in BUFFY), once seen never to be forgotten.<br /><br />A couple of reviewers have stated that this film is "boring."  I have absolutely no idea what they were talking about or what their film going background is.  I will state in no qualified terms that I can't imagine any sophisticated film viewer not being completely astonished by this film.  I can state in complete honesty that this is the finest film of any kind that I have seen in many years.</p></body></html>

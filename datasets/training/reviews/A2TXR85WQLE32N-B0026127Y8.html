<meta name="summary" content="Righteous Retribution..."></head><body><p>2008's extremely violent thriller "Taken" features Liam Neeson as Brian Mills, a retired spy whose daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) is kidnapped by white slavers from her apartment in Paris.<br /><br />Mills puts the skill set of his former employment to work.  He is prepared to rescue his daughter by any means necessary.  What follows is a thrill ride across Paris, through streets, cellars, apartments, offices and bridges, as Mills methodically and ruthlessly wrings information from various felons and follows the clues to a final showdown on a barge in the Seine River.<br /><br />The action is fast, furious, and fatal, as Mills leaves a trail of corpses behind him.  The good news is that they all had it coming.  The bad news is the PG-13 rating should be taken seriously.  The short running time (90 minutes) and almost continuous action cover up some gapping plot holes, while leaving little room for moral ambiguity.  "Taken" is highly recommended to those fans of action movies who still miss "Dirty Harry."</p></body></html>

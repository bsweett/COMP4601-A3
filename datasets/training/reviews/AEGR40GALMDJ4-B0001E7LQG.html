Finally a movie has been made for the over 50 crowd.  Ironically it can appeal to anyone, not just seniors.  I had so much fun watching this film.  Amanda Peet, Frances McDormand, and Keany Reeves highlight the supporting cast.  The film may be a tad offensive to the older folks, but it is completely likeable.  Keaton reprised the Annie Hall type role once again, and Jack Nicholson plays a cooky Hugh Hefner type.  I applaud this film.  All Rom. Comedy film fans should see it.</p></body></html>

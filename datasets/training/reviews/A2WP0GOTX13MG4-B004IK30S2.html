<meta name="summary" content="Expected More, But Worth at Least One Viewing"></head><body><p>Ron Burgandy, played by Will Ferrell, is an anchorman for the highest rated local news team in San Diego during the '70's.  The local news has no competition from cable of any sort, so Burgandy and his crew are celebrities in the San Diego area.  His viewers recite his trademark line that he closes every broadcast with:  "San Diegeo, you stay classy."  Burgandy has a dream of one day becoming a national news anchor.  Then, Veronica Corningstone, played by Christina Applegate, comes to work at the station, and Burgandy's world is thrown off its axis....<br /><br />This movie definitely has its moments.  Ferrell shines at various points in the movie as a newsman that is full of himself, but is large in his community, that is just doesn't matter.  The movie does an adequate job spoofing local television news (right down to the almost unnatural attention a pregnant panda gets).  The gangster like rivalry between the local news stations (which have crews filled with Ferrell's buddies, such as Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, and Luke Wilson) is amusing and culminates in a rumble.  Fred Willard also turns in his usual excellent comedic performance as head of the newsroom.<br /><br />However, the comedy is not evenly paced and frequently over the top simply to be over the top in the hopes of getting a laugh.  Ferrell's big hit 'Old School' did a much better job of maintaining an even level of humor without having to get so ridiculous as to lose the plot.  The movie could have been better with a few more news scenes that allowed Ferrell's behind the desk personality to take center stage.<br /><br />Overall, Ferrell fans will probably like the movie, but will probably be a little let down after movies like 'Old School.'  Its worth a rental, but don't set your expectations too high.<br /><br />Overall Grade:  3 stars.</p></body></html>

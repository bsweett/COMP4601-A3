<meta name="summary" content="The Black Dahlia According to James Ellroy"></head><body><p>There's much to like in THE BLACK DAHLIA, the 2006 filming of author James Ellroy best-selling novel that was inspired by Los Angeles' most infamous unsolved murder case.<br /><br />Director Brian DePalma has not only recreated Los Angeles of the 1940s to perfection, but he has also filled the film with several memorable sequences.<br /><br />These include the discovery of Elizabeth Short's severed body at the same time that a police shoot-out is taking place on the next block, and, later, a triple murder on a three-story open staircase in an office building.<br /><br />On the other hand, Ellroy's novel and Josh Friedman's screenplay adaptation are both very complex, with multiple storylines continually criss-crossing to the point where the picture is sometimes difficult to follow.<br /><br />An audience can only assimilate so much exposition at one time.  Thus, this is that rare movie that would have benefited from a longer running time, so that these storylines could have been better developed.<br /><br />The principal plot revolves around the relationship between two Los Angeles police detectives, both former boxers who are now partnered.  Josh Hartnett is the younger, more idealistic of the pair, while Aaron Eckhart has the experience, but is also plagued by demons from his past that are stirred up by The Black Dahlia case.  Indeed, he becomes obsessed with Ms. Short's grisly murder.<br /><br />Scarlett Johansson is Eckhart's platonic girl friend, who is attracted to Hartnett.  She also has a dark secret, as does Hilary Swank, the bi-sexual, nymphomaniac spoiled daughter of a wealthy contractor who Hartnett ultimately discovers is the key to the Dahlia mystery.<br /><br />There are some fine performances in THE BLACK DAHLIA.  I was most impressed with Mia Kirshner as Ms. Short, Mike Starr as a police detective and, although some critics have disagreed, Ms. Swank as the femme fatale.<br /><br />The DVD from Universal Studios Home Entertainment contains three excellent "Making of" documentaries, the most interesting of which has Ellroy discussing the facts of the actual The Black Dahlia case and revealing the personal tragedy (i.e. the murder of his mother when he was ten-years-old) that compelled him to write his novel.<br /><br />?

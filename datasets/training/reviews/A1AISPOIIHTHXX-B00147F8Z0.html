Anderson films are watchable in that dumb fun way (unlike Uwe Boll who can't even entertain a lobotomy patient). When Anderson took on the Alien vs. Predator series, many groaned when it came out since it had all the aforementioned trademarks as well as being PG-13 and rather tame considering the violence found in both franchises. The sequel, clearly with intent to change that, also falls into the same problems: it's dumb, unmemorable and inexplicably, it's kind of hard to see.<br /><br />Taking place directly after Anderson's film, a "Predalien" (hey, just be glad people didn't dub it the "Alienator") causes problems on the ship, causing it to crash on Earth. With a distant Predator answering the call, he's on his way to stop not only the Predator/Alien hybrid and occasionally killing any human that comes his way. Several humans such as a delivery boy, some high school students, a soldier returning from duty and a sheriff band together to hopefully escape the town alive.<br /><br />Besides "Predator", the films always centered on low lighting and creepy environments to get you in the frame of mind. However, not a single director confused too much darkness for horror and regardless of the lighting, you could always see what was happening. Not here since I'm not kidding when I say this is probably one of the dimmest and visually dull looking films I've come across. Even scenes in the daylight seem somewhat muted and things get awful when in places like sewers or dark hallways where it's hard to tell what you're looking at. One time, one human died and I couldn't even tell who it was; I'm serious. Couple that with the oft-used tendency to have quick editing during fight scenes and it's a pain just to watch the film.<br /><br />That is but one of the film's problems since it's badly-written with awful dialogue, unmemorable characters (I just watched and I could remember maybe...2 names?) and there's just plot holes and dumb decisions all over the place. AVP always felt to me like a good B-movie franchise but that doesn't mean they have to literally make something that bad. At least the violence is a bit more obvious and nastier than the first one but other times it seems more cruel and violent for the sake of being violent, as evidenced by a hunter and his son and a group of pregnant women.<br /><br />Anderson's take on the franchise may not be a good film by any means but strange for me to admit but I kind of liked it in that "it didn't waste my time" way. The sequel improves on key areas but then it fails utterly and completely in many other levels. Why they can't seem to get it right is very disheartening.</p></body></html>

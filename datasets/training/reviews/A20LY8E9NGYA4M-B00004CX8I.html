<meta name="summary" content="BEST JACK NICHOLSON PERFORMANCE, ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER"></head><body><p>This movie is one of the best films that emerged from the 1970s decade, &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot; ranks in the same level of &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, &quot;Chinatown&quot;, &quot;Jaws&quot; among other films from that great movie era. The performance that Jack Nicholson delivered is absolutely brilliant, he created a charismatic and free spirited character.<br /><br /> Louise Fletcher (as nurse Mildred Ratched) gave another incredible performance that results in one of best movie nemesis of all time, a low-key, dominating character. The support cast is also excellent, it features enjoyable characters played by solid actors such as Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif and Will Sampson.<br /><br /> This movie is a great combination of drama, satire and comedy, the film can make the audience laugh in one scene, and cry in the next one. The director of the movie, Milos Forman did a great job with the entire cast, Forman helped every actor to produce genuine feelings and emotions in front of the cameras.<br /><br /> This is the kind of movie that you can see year after year, and enjoy it every time and discover something new. &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot; should be in every movie fan collection.</p></body></html>

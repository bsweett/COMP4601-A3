However after the initial tornadoes and massive tidal wave engulfing New York, the film loses momentum and some rather bad acting comes to the fore. Jake Gyllenhaal seems to be channeling Tobey Maguire, and the rest of the ensemble cast don't hold up to well. There is something really real and quite haunting about seeing a possible future displayed so vividly, but the whole excercise looses realism when the silly comic book ice-chasing-people rubbish starts. Add a nauseating layer of cheese (especially near the end), and you've got a distinctly shaky movie. Roland Emmerich isn't much with storytelling, but the CGI is admit impressive.A 5-Star effects movie but a 3 star film.</p></body></html>

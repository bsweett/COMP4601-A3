<meta name="summary" content="VERY ENTERTAINING MOVIE"></head><body><p>THE RUNDOWN<br /><br />I have always been a fan of the Rock or should I say Dwayne Johnson especially in villain roles [film and wrestling], but what ever I have always been a fan. This movie in particular was really the first time Dwayne shined, I know the "Scorpion King" and all that was out first but that really was in his wrestling/action realm. This was the first time he was put a little out of his norm [although there is a lot of action and fights] with addition of comedy. He was always good a making people laugh and it was a natural fit and I must say that he pulled it off nicely.<br /><br />Beck [The Rock] is working for a rich guy retrieving late payments form various people and he is really good at his job. After crashing a party and knocking out some pro football players he thinks his time working for this man is done, but he has one more job left. He can't refuse to do it because he needs the cash to open up his own restaurant. So off he goes to the Amazon to hunt one Travis [Seann William Scott] and bring him back home to papa, Travis has other plans as he is close to finding a priceless artifact. Unfortunately for both of them Mariana [Rosario Dawson] the leader of a rebel group and Hatcher [Christopher Walken] the leader of the oppressors of the natives both want to stop them. So the fun begins as they must fight both groups, each other, the jungle, and some monkeys in a quest to get home.<br /><br />Naturally this is a funny movie and very enjoyable particularly the cast, every one is excellent in this movie. The Rock is very charismatic and has a great presence on the screen, he gives a great performance here. Seann William Scott is excellent here which is nice because he can be really annoying in certain roles, can you guess what those are? Rosario Dawson is fine and also gives a great performance and once again is very much, fine. Christopher Walken as always is a legend and commands respect every time he is on screen, always great to see him. Ewen Bremner is a scene stealer in this one with his whip wielding ways, oh those silly oppressors.<br /><br />The script by R.J. Stewart and James Vanderbilt is great and full of some great and funny moments but it is the action that marks my favorite parts of the film. There is one scene in particular that has a lot to do with Capoeira or Capawara depending, although Travis calls it some kind of Jiu-Jitsu or something. Director Peter Berg did a nice job with this film adding in that art form in particular. Add in some excellent shoot outs, fights and some excellent scenes involving monkeys and you get a very entertaining movie.<br /><br />This is not the best movie ever and may not even be the best WWE produced film either but it is close in the latter. I would recommend a purchase on this one but you could go with a rental if you prefer. This is a very entertaining movie and is perfect for a Saturday at any time, love those lazy days.</p></body></html>

Interestingly, D9 came about because the crew hired to do 'Halo, the Movie' found itself out of work as the project was dropped and, somehow, they were able to direct some of the funding to the making of District 9.<br /><br />THE STORY<br /><br />It all starts when giant spaceship parks itself a few thousand feet above Johannesburg, South Africa and, to everyone's dismay, it turns out to be inhabited by hundreds of thousands of strange looking extraterrestrials in a sorry state who, apparently, lacked the skills to operate or maintain the ship. The alien nation quickly becomes a burden on the South African state who has no choice but show humanity and feed them but keeps them inside a ghetto-like shanty town where crime is rampant and despair is deep. Unable to integrate into the 'human' social structure, the aliens barely survive on international food aid and supplement their income selling technology on the black market and making other shady deals.<br /><br />Enter Wikus Van De Merwe, a ruthless but efficient government bureaucrat in charge with overseeing and containing the alien mess. An accident, literally transforms Wikus into someone capable of seeing the world through the aliens' eyes. And that's what drives the rest of the movie - Wikus slowly increasing empathy and sympathy for the aliens' plight as some of the aliens begin to see him as a friend.<br /><br />District 9 is an exercise in 'what if'. You set the stage in South Africa - and we are somewhat familiar with the country's recent history - you introduce the nearly-helpless, different and needy aliens, you throw some insensitive government bureaucracy and a little international go-goodism and it's 'lights, camera, action'. The special features interviews reveal what quickly comes apparent from watching the movie - a lot of it is improvisation. Directed and written by Neill Blomkamp - his first film, I believe, with Peter Jackson of Lord of the Rings fame as the producer and a number of ambitious actors, the crew often just wings it and more often than not, they manage to produce some interesting or at least exotic-looking interactions. It's not social or apartheid critique they claim but it surely looks that way and having the movie shot on location in Soweto does leave that impression.<br /><br />Overall, it's not a bad sci-fi product but it definitely lacks the polish and the internal consistency that would have turned this good movie into a great movie. It would have helped if the original premise was convincing - but a giant spaceship showing up with a million aliens of which none seemed capable to operate it it's not credible. I would have a lot more to say on the topic but I'd rather not spoil the fun by revealing any more of the plot.<br /><br />BLU-RAY<br /><br />The Blu-ray version does include a few Blu-exclusive features:<br /> - MoviieIQ provides information on various aspects of the movie as the movie plays - pretty nice and it's unobtrusive.<br />- Cinechat would support live chat while watching the movie - not easy to do, would require a lot of coordination.<br />- God of War III demo is included and it can be played on a PS3.<br /><br />Additional feature include:<br />- The always present "Deleted Scenes"<br />- The Alien Agenda: A Filmmaker's Log - we learn many details about the origins and the making of District 9.<br />- Metamorphosis: The Transformation of Wikus - discusses 'makeup'.<br />- A couple more extras of 'the making of'.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the unique Blu special features, I can't say that Blu-ray enhances the viewer's experience in a significant way, probably because, maybe on purpose or maybe because of the low budget, a lot of the movie is supposed to be news footage and most of the shots are not of a high level, 'professional' quality. The same it goes for the sound.<br /><br />MY RATING<br /><br />I will somewhat reluctantly rate District 9 as a 4-star - means "I like it", mostly because I found the idea of "aliens in distress drop on 'second world' or 'third world' country" quite intriguing and because the crew's enthusiasm and energy were able to deliver an overall good product despite some clear budget and time constraints. Hopefully, this is not the last Neill Blomkamp movie.<br /><br />This being a borderline 4-star, I would suggest a rental or pay-per-view to decide whether it's worth actually buying it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="400th Anniversary of Jamestown is right around the corner: 1607-2007"></head><body><p>First off, I love the scenery (I live close to Jamestown and have visited the historical site many times) and the young Q-Orianka Kilcher is very good as Pocahontas. Colin Farrell isn't on his best game here and the great Christian Bale doesn't even enter the picture until the last half an hour. The visuals are nice, but I wish I would have waited to catch this one on DVD. Even with the 17 minutes or so cut to help with the pacing, it still seemed a bit long at times. The action was kept to a minimum and the movie seemed to be focused more in the romance department. The narration was also hard to understand at times and was used in parts that you would expect to have dialogue. The New World is a very quiet movie and doesn't rush through any of the scenes (some linger on too long), but it is nice to look at and it shows some good history of the founding of America.</p></body></html>

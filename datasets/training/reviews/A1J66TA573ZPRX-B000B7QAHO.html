<meta name="summary" content="Weird, insane, dark, etc o thats right its a Tim Burton movie"></head><body><p>Wow it was very different from the original but yet some what similar.  I liked the original the music was good and yet I liked this one a little bit better.  Gene Wilder was great as Willy Wonka, but Johnny Depp gave a different look at Willy Wonka a more stranger side then Wilder gave us.  Both were great as Willy Wonka but both gave their own versions of him.  Both have alot of differences and some what similar.  Wilder's version of Willy Wonka was more of adult and less stranger whereas Depp's version of Willy Wonka was stranger then Wilder'sand acted more like a little kid and also kind of sounded like Micheal Jackson and a little like Dr. Evil but still was cool.  Of course Tim Burton gives us a little weirder and darker side to his movies.  Like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Ed Wood, Beatlejuice, Batman, Batman Returns, Planet of the Apes, etc... they are wierd at times and dark.  But they are all classics.  Except for Edward Scissors Hands I hated that movie.  Missi Pyle is hot.</p></body></html>

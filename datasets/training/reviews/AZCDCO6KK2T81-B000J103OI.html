<meta name="summary" content="The Devil is Clever, But NOT Up to All the Hype"></head><body><p>The hype around this film really made me believe that I was going to see a dynomite and insighful film on the clothing industry.  It was insightful at times, but never a dynomite film.  Now don't get me wrong here.  I liked the movie; however, I was disapppointed.<br /><br />Meryl Streep was very convincing in her role which could have easily been played with over-the-top gusto like a Cruella De Ville stereotype, but Streep down plays the role while still commanding the screen.  We see her weakness at times with a passing glance or eyes red from crying.  She has always been a versatile actress and will probably get another Oscar nod for this film and it is deserving (although she will lose to Helen Mirren's "Queen" role).<br /><br />Anne Hathaway has played this role to death in a number of other films, but here she is more believable as she has grown as an actress.  She is a bit more jaded now and less pure; hence, her jumping in the sack with the good-looking journalist less than a day after breaking up with her childish, self-absorbed boyfriend who never supported her much (just like her friends who loved all the goodies she brought them, but wanted her to not succeed without them in tow --what a dislikable lot they were).<br /><br />This leads to me to ambiguous theme of the film.  I got the distinct impression that I was being lectured that one can't have a successful career and still have family and friends.  This theme is handled in a rather heavy handed manner.  I might buy into it if Andrea's friends were more likable, less self-absorbed, and, frankly, less jealous.  They seem to come across as that crowd that sneers at success while wanting it themselves.  Andrea herself starts out that way.  Even her boyfriend at the end of the film tells Andrea of this great new job in Boston that is everything he's always wanted as if expecting her to cheer him on when he never really supported her much.  Granted that Andrea's job did rob her of time with family and friends and being the assistant to anyone famous does often require that sacrifice; however, I feel that success in general is being condemn in this film.  Being successful doesn't always mean in league with the "devil".<br /><br />Well, regardless of all that opinionated stuff I just spewed out, I really did like this film.  It wasn't all I had hoped, but it was good.  Streep is reliable as always and saves the role from stereotype, Hathaway proves she is a "grown up" actress now, and the ever wonderful Stanley Tucci, is solid support as the one who appropriately dislikes Andrea for not liking a job others would die for and for her attitude about the whole business.  All his petty little insults seems to be done with a wink as if deep down he actually likes Andrea for not being intimidated by Streep's Miranda and a business she herself knows little about.  He does a believable 180 when Andrea does the same.  It's a case of mutual respect here and it worked very well in the film.  In fact, it was my favorite aspect of the film.  To each his own.<br /><br />I do recommend the film, just go into for the "fluff" entertainment it is supposed to be.  Don't get pulled into all the 4 and 5 star reviews and claims of an exhilirating, hilarious time.  It simply won't measure up to that hype.  Well, at least it didn't to this reviewer.</p></body></html>

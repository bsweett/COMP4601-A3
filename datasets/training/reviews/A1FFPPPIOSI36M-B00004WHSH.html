<meta name="summary" content="This is a very scary movie for married men"></head><body><p>As in most post 70's, Stanley Kubrick movies, his films are challenging, require repeated viewings and demand the viewer to work to understand what's going on.<br /><br />Similar to "Fatal Attraction", this is a warning to married men to not explore what may be thought as "the other side of the fence" and to not take for granted what is not appeared to be broken. Men, don't mess with your marriage, you may not like what is out there!<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays a successful doctor that asks questions of his wife, that he should not neccessarily want the answers, and then, after a marital argument, he ventures into the seamy ( I mean VERY SEAMY) side of after hours, New York, sampling the possible fruits of what can be had. It's scary and poses an eventual threat, not only to his marriage, but also to his and his wife's actual life.<br /><br />When I first saw this is the theater, I was disappointed. The utilization of such A-list stars, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, detracted from the microscopic, extremely personal and psychological story of a successful couple that appears to have it all yet there, nonetheless, exists a fragility that may instantly implode their perfect world. They were too big of stars however, the late Sidney Pollack is mesmerizing as Cruise's doctor cohort during the day, but a very scary, villain at night. His role was positively chilling.<br /><br />This is a challenging film that is not easy to digest. However, repeated viewings (even catching bits and pieces as it plays on cable) reveals an artistic masterpiece that is sterotype Kubrick.<br /><br />Most reviews go into too deep of an analysis of this movie as though the flick is extraordinarily complicated. That's a misgiving. I learned to understand and appreciate this film when I viewed it as a simple warning of not to take a marriage for granted.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick is among the greatest of directors preciseley for the reason why this movie has a delayed appreciation component. His movies are not forgettable, warrant intense study and provide a rich reward for a deep understanding.</p></body></html>

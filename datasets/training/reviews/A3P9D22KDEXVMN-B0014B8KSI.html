<meta name="summary" content="Great Film with Excellent Acting"></head><body><p>Michael Clayton, starring George Clooney in an academy award nominated performance, is a corporate thriller featuring a class action lawsuit against a chemical company.  The story is in the tradition of John Grisham, while the acting is in the greatest tradition. Clooney is joined by two other academy award nominated performances: Tom Wilkinson and Tilda Swinton (winner).  The movie is evenly paced with a very interesting plot.  This is an enjoyable film that is well-worth watching.<br /><br />James Gilroy wrote and directed this film.  Gilroy was the screenwriter for the Bourne Trilogy.  Though this film lacks the action of the Bourne films, it certainly features the thoughtful plots.  This is a morally ambiguous film that has a message, but it is subtle.  The hero is not alway heroic, yet he is always sympathetic.<br /><br />A four star movie.</p></body></html>

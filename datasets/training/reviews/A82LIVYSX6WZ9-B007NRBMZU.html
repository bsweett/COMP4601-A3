<meta name="summary" content="Ashton Kutcher is not that believable....the effect sucks"></head><body><p>Ashton Kutcher (A Lot Like Love, Guess Who) stars in this totally dull and empty thriller/drama about a boy who suffered from blackouts during his childhood and wrote when he did, he wrote them down in his journal. He left his hometown and now he's in college, that's Kutcher, and when Kutcher reads the journals of his past he is instantly transported back into child form so he can prevent bad things, examples are death of a mom and  her baby, falling in love with his friends sister who's dad, played by Eric Stoltz (Kicking and Screaming, Out Of Order) is a pedophile and video tapes. He soon changes it, but is this really the place he wanted to go as he tries to change it several more times, each with different outcomes and consequences. Also starring Amy Smart (Road Trip, Varsity Blues), William Lee Scott (Identity, October Sky), Elden Henson (Idle Hands, The Mighty), Ethan Suplee (Mallrats, Evolution) and Melora Walters (Magnolia, Desert Saints). Kutcher is not even close to being convincing in his role where he tries to show us another side of his acting but come on.....who really cares? A good supportive cast is wasted. Not much to look at...though it is an interesting premise but we coulf of had someone else besides Kutcher....litereally</p></body></html>

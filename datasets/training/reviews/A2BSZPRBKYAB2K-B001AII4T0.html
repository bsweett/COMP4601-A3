<meta name="summary" content="Great action, acting, and plot"></head><body><p>This is truely a great movie from when the suspense begins to the end.  I wont get into the details since it has been reviewed on here before.  Let me just say that it kept my interest in finding out if Russia and the U.S. "push the nuclear button" as the tension rises.  One standout in this great movie is Liev Schriber, what a great actor!  Also Morgan Freeman, Ben Affleck, Bridget Monohan, and others make this a great action and tense filled movie.  One last thought, if people think this movie and plot is a little far fetched, then remember what happened on 9/11.  Before that happened, people probably thought that would NEVER happen as well.  One final note, it is too bad that Tom Clancy (who's book the movie is based on) is an arogant jerk.  I met this person at a book signing in the early 1990's.  What a disappointment.  The man is a "know it all" who really knows far less than he thinks.</p></body></html>

In `Apocalypse' we are given more of the same but it doesn't seem to really perform as well as the first film.  The sets aren't as exciting or as memorable, and the inclusion of Nemeses may excite some it left me a bit stale.  Milla is still as great and as fun as ever, and new to the game stars like Sienna Guillory (who plays video game favorite Jill Valentine) and Oded Fehr do a fine job of supporting her but the real stars are the CGI effects which work well for the most part.  Expect lots of action and lots of blood but with Michelle Rodriguez's snappy Rain missing and the lack of originality found in the first `Resident Evil' film `Apocalypse' just isn't strong enough to warrant it's own following.  Maybe three's a charm.</p></body></html>

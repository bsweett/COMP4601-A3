<meta name="summary" content="A MUST SEE!"></head><body><p>This is a great comic-book-to-film creation.  I really enjoyed the plot, the action, and the acting.  The shoot-outs are filmed in such a way that you can actually tell who is shooting at who, the good guys actually get hurt, and the bad guys are evil enough that you want to see them "get-their's".<br /><br />  The Punisher is a film that has that "IT" factor that a movie needs to be successful: predictable enough to expect certain things, but not so predictable that the movie is a wash.<br /><br />  What I really enjoyed about the film was the combination of good fight scenes with good "thinking revenge" scenes - the way The Punisher uses his brain to create situations that have the "bad guys" fighting amongst themselves adds flavor to the film.<br /><br />  I think The Punisher is one of the coolest comic book heroes because he is one of the most believable super heroes - no special powers, but he is on a real mission to get real "bad guys."  It makes him a very interesting character indeed.  After his entire family is ordered to be murdered by a money-laundering kingpin, FBI agent Frank Castle begins his crusade of revenge against the entire group of gangsters.  What follows is an entertaining film that is worth purchasing.<br /><br />  I waited way too long to finally watch this film.  It holds its own against any other comic book film that has been produced.  So don't wait any longer; buy it, rent it, or borrow it today.<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></body></html>

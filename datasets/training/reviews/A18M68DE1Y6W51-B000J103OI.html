<meta name="summary" content="Hilarious"></head><body><p>I first saw this DVD under duress: A friend insisted we watch it. I had preconceived notions: Meryl Streep will overplay her character. Anne Hathaway will be too cute. I'll be bored, bored, bored. WRONG!!!<br /><br />Meryl Streep is totally hilarious as the over-the-top boss from hell, Miranda Priestly. Anne Hathaway IS cute, but in a well-acted, believable way that makes you want to hug her. It was a pleasure to see Stanley Tucci chew up the scenery, and the fashions, to me, make the movie.<br /><br />So now I'm ordering this DVD, thrilled to have it. It's the type of movie you can watch with your girlfriends (and the occasional "sure-of-his-masculinity male") while it snows outside and you eat all the popcorn and ice cream you promised not to touch.<br /><br />Great casting, great editing, terrific shots of New York, Paris, runways and the lot. A winner.</p></body></html>

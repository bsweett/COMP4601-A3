<meta name="summary" content="SE7EN A Smart, Engrossing Thriller..."></head><body><p>David Fincher is one of most respected film directors thanks to his works in the suspense genre, the noir and dark chills of THE GAME and the mysterious, scary, and atmospheric scares found in SEVEN, which happens to boast great performances, scary moments that will take the breath right out of you, and creepy visuals that only help to enhance the film's overall dark feel. The setting is used to great effect as well, as you'll find out for yourself while you're watching this movie.<br /><br />The movie stars Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as two detectives from two different paths who happen to unite on a very chilling case. It begins with the death of a fat man who has ingested so much spaghetti that his killer hasn't necessarily done the deed, but has helped to create a morbid masterpiece of death that even boggles detectives Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt). The two seem to form a mutual respect and a unique bond as a result of eventually working on the cast together, and as the murders pile up, so does the suspense and the chills. The scariest moment of the film involves the discovery of a body in an apartment complex that looks like a corpse that, according to the evidence they find, has been there for over a year. When the body moves and wriggles around, you'll jump five feet out of your seat. They chase the killer down alleyways, cutting corners and getting hurt in the process. Again, the setting is incredibly strong, adding to the air of suspense present throughout the feature. As Somerset and Mills continue to compile evidence and theories to solve the mystery of the killer's "seven deadly sins" motive, he unwittingly shows up at the precinct and gives himself up...ah, but he's got a motive.<br /><br />While on the car ride out to the open to find the last of the killer's victims, they unwittingly end up in a game that leads one of them to a fatal flaw: the last two deadly sins. Mills doesn't realize that his wife was murdered by the killer, and he decided to take a prize with him: her head. The tension and suspense builds to such tight levels at this point near the close of the film, you'll be biting your nails and waiting for the rope to snap. Indeed, the ending proves to be quite powerful, and after the credits are rolling, you'll be asking yourself many questions and be praising the movie's tight weave of suspense and dark comedy.<br /><br />Gwenyth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey, and Leland Orser all make good impressions in this film, but without a doubt, Kevin Spacey nearly steals the show as the infamous killer who takes his work seriously and is so subdued and calm about his demeanor, you'll start to wonder whether the people you're around in your real life could be like him. Freeman and Pitt, again, are stellar in the lead roles, making you feel every bit of anguish, every laugh, every tear, every scare, every breath. You even start to feel the sweat and  the wounds like you've inherited them. The movie's cinematography is excellent, and the photography elements are perfectly set. No doubt this was Fincher's little masterpiece, and following it up with THE GAME only proved his importance in this genre.<br /><br />So while their are some genuine chills to be had, the atmosphere and smart script keep you on your toes. Working from a premise of such style and uniqueness, SEVEN is one of the best thrillers committed to film and should be viewed at least once in your lifetime. Don't let this pass you up...it could be your one and only sin.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Worthy conclusion(?) to the series"></head><body><p>No need to recap or synopsize what other have said. Here's my take.<br /><br />Best one of the three. Least `camp' factor. Deadly serious. Consistently dark, and with nobody taking easy ways out. Those who needed to die died. It doesn't end fuzzy-wuzzy, but hopeful.<br /><br />Better than Spiderman; more complex, less navel-gazing, yet possibly more profound. Underneath the vexing question: what constitutes `illness' or `disease'? What does it mean to be different, and especially if there's a whole lot of you? This isn't Spiderman agonizing over his authenticity of being or something like that, but a whole group of people whose identity as individuals and a community are under threat. Do they have the right to defend themselves. How far are they allowed to go? How far is the rest of the world allowed to go? This isn't about right and wrong but questions that have no definite answer.<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com. Author: Keaen, Seladi?nna, Continuity Slip.</p></body></html>

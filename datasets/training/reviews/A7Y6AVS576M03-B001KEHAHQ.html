<meta name="summary" content="Good One"></head><body><p>This is not a bad one, but a "good one" as Clouseau says several times in this film. It's not a remake of the original but a new story based on the theft once more of the famous Pink Panther diamond and murder of its last owner. One thing about this film is that it gives Steve Martin a chance to act rather than present a variation of his usual self up there on the screen. He does not try to copy Seller's interpretation of the role that he had long established but uses elements from Seller's and his own film experiences to create something new, different yet recognizable. Martin's performance, though strained at times, really comes through in the final third of the film and he shows us a bit of some witt lacking in Seller's performance. Martin's performance is closer to Arkin's in 1968's INSPECTOR CLOUSEAU. You actually have an amount of empathy for Martin and that seems so work and save this film. The titles are good behind the "Pink Panther" theme and the rest of the score even demonstrates some moving innovation at times. In all this is not a bad Pink Panther film. It's familiar but just a little different and updated for the times.</p></body></html>

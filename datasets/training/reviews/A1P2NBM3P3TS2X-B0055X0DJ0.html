The script and dialogue sound like they were written by an 8th grader.  The film itself looks like a long music video.  Sometimes the camera will just NOT STOP MOVING.  It makes one dizzy after a while.  I guess the director and cameraman get mileage points.<br /><br />Some of the sexual content is WAY too inappropriate for the younger portion of the target audience.<br /><br />Shia LeBeouf looks like he's wearing a spray-on tan.<br /><br />"The bigger they are, the harder they fall."  Remember that, Megan Fox, when you are no longer the Hottie of the Moment.<br /><br />This movie, like the one before it and the three Star Wars prequels, was made to show off how spiffy the effects can look and THAT'S ALL.  No intelligent or coherent script.  This film is meant to be EYE CANDY ONLY.<br /><br />Kind of disappointing, too.  So much potential with the effects and budget, yet they took the "low road" in the Brains department.<br /><br />For the record, I didn't pay to see it (nor would I).  I snuck into the screening room after leaving a showing of "Public Enemies".  Not a single Space Robot in "Public Enemies" and yet it was a far, far superior film.  Go figure.<br /><br />Michael Bay movies have become their own genre:  loud, visually impressive, and dumb as a bucket of hair.  I don't think it bothers him or the studios for one nanosecond that so many people hate his films for being dumb and badly directed.  I don't think he's even trying to make a good film any more.  He specializes in Junk Food Cinema, and that's all you will likely ever get from him.<br /><br />He takes advantage of moviegoers with low standards.  And he'll laugh all the way to the bank.  One of these days he's gonna make a film so bad even his devoted fans won't like it.  But by then he'll be so rich he won't care, if he's not already.  Wait!  That's it!  He's ALREADY so rich he doesn't have to care!  THAT'S why his movies stink so bad.<br /><br />Believe me, the only artistically talented contributors to his films are sitting in air-conditioned offices at ILM and the other effects houses.  They produce the "wow" factor and Bay reaps the benefits and most of the glory.<br /><br />Skip this movie.</p></body></html>

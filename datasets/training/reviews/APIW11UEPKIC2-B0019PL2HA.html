Maybe it was because we don't get that super crazy Will Ferrel we are used to.  In fact when he does go crazy it is not all that fun like when he thinks he is on fire.  BUT the director seems to take a different approach and puts in a little less comedy to put more into the story.  It really doesn't work but it makes for a good endign with the family getting back together and all.  Not being a fan of 'Anchor Man' I still have to say that 'Ricky Bobby' is not as good.  I am stuck between a 2 and a 3 because I come to a Will Ferrel to see some the insane thigns that he does but I am a sucker for a good ending to a movie.</p></body></html>

Main characters are two Irish hit men forced to take time off in a small town of Bruges, Belgium.  There are cultural clashes between Irish/flemish/American and Canadian participants of this story that are very, very funny because they hit every prejudice known to mankind; there is moral dilemma of a hit man who accidentally kills a young boy during one of his "jobs"; there is a middle age "career" crisis of of hit man considering retirement.  The plot is complex and it is enhanced by the wonderful piano music and off beat humor.  Cast is fantastic and although everyone keeps talking about Farrell and Gleeson, Ralph Fiennes gives wonderful performance that somewhat resembles sociophathic character portrayed by Ben Kingley in "Sexy Beast" movie from almost a decade ago.<br /><br />I absolutely enjoyed this movie and I recommend it to everyone.  You will laugh about parts of this movie for days...  Best dark comedy I have seen recently.</p></body></html>

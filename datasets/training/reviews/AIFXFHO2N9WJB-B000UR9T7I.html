<meta name="summary" content="Every Hero Has a Choice..."></head><body><p>After two hugely successful films, "Spiderman" and "Spiderman 2" respectively, Sony Pictures `Spiderman' franchise was definitely at the top of its game entering into the third, and for the moment, the supposed final chapter in the `Spiderman' series, at least as far as stars Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst may be concerned (their contracts were only good for three movies). So, with the primary cast assembled once again, Sam Raimi back in the director's chair, and also serving as co-writer with his brother Ivan and acclaimed writer Alvin Sargent ("Spiderman 2"), the latest chapter for good ol' web head was shaping up to be just as epic, and no doubt visually amazing, as its predecessors. Throw in a few more villains than usual, Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), Venom (Topher Grace), and New Goblin (James Franco), to mess with Spidey's life and loves, along with a certain black space goo that will bring out the worst in Peter's psyche, and Spiderman may just be in for a bigger fight than even he can handle. Not to mention the fact that Peter Parker/Spiderman, and all those aforementioned talented people responsible for bringing the character to life, must face the daunting task of attempting to top the first 2 films; but hey, superheroes are used to the odds being stacked against them so this film may have ended up being just business as usual for Spidey, but only time would tell.<br /><br />"Spiderman 3" begins with Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) becoming swept up in his own hype as the citizens of New York are embracing a sort of Spidey-mania craze. As happy as Peter Parker/Spiderman's life seems to be, events are being set into motion that will soon bring him down off of his high. Peter's girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is having difficulty finding success on Broadway, and with Peter's newfound arrogance, she is slowly beginning to get jealous of his rising popularity. Also, Peter's former best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), has embraced his father's dark ways and has become the New Goblin, and his only goal is to see Spiderman pay for his father's death. As if this old friend turned new villain, and the possibility of losing his longtime love wasn't enough to deal with, a new super-villain is created in the form of the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church). To top things off a strange alien substance has landed on Earth, and has found a kind of kindred spirit in the newly arrogant Spiderman, and as it bonds to its new host, the alien symbiote begins to slowly corrupt Spidey's soul, until he no longer knows who he truly is any longer. This time the odds may just be too much for Spiderman to handle by himself.<br /><br />If there is one thing that can be said about "Spiderman 3" that audiences and critics everywhere can agree on, it's the fact that this film is definitely the biggest in the franchise thus far. That aside, "Spiderman 3" found our hero not just in new territory by facing more than one villain in the film, but also finding himself disliked by many movie critics and audiences. Where the first two films were universally liked by everyone, this movie split audiences fairly even in their reactions to it. Many felt the story was far too bloated, with way too many new characters introduced, which resulted in uneven character development in some instances, giving the movie a disjointed feel that lacked the smooth flow of the previous two films and even made it a little difficult to follow. Another problem some audiences had was that the movie seemed to focus more on action than on the personal dramas being played out by the characters, not to mention the ending left people a little cold due to some corny dialogue between Peter and Harry, and a somewhat sappy and unbelievable resolution to the Sandman conflict. For those that enjoyed the movie, there were still some gripes that were shared with those that disliked it, but for the most part the gripes didn't seem to affect their view of the movie too much. I for one enjoyed "Spiderman 3", but found it to be the least enjoyable out of the series so far, still it's better than a lot of the action movies that Hollywood churns out. I agreed with some of the sentiments from those that hated the movie, but found some of their thoughts to be off in my opinion. Where I agree the most with those that disliked the film, is in the disappointing resolution to Sandman's conflict with Spiderman, especially in light of events that had occurred moments before between the two characters, but apparently Sam Raimi and his writers liked the resolution, though one does wonder why. Although, it did seem as if the writers were trying too hard to top themselves, which is a possible explanation for why this movie had so much going on, I must disagree with those who found the movie to be too hard to follow or lacked any sense of flow, apparently those audience members must not have been paying attention during the movie.<br /><br />The cast for "Spiderman 3" continues the tradition of excellence that this series had set forth with the very first movie. Tobey Maguire once again portrays the dual persona of Peter Parker/Spiderman, and this time he gets to show off a new side to Peter that had previously remained untapped, which would be his darker side. This element to the character's story arc was on one hand one of the true highlights of the film, but on the other was one of the film's weak points. I enjoyed seeing an angrier, more aggressive Spiderman, and the black suit definitely looked sleek and cool; however, I grew tired of Peter's darker side being essentially an uber-nerd, granted this is most likely true to character, but a little less of this side could have been shown and I would have been much happier, I especially could have done with some editing during the sequence where Peter is checking out all of the ladies on the streets of New York (too much cheese for my taste). Kirsten Dunst looked much better as Mary Jane Watson in this film than she did in "Spiderman 2", I don't know what happened in the previous movie, but she looked way too pale and even a little unattractive, not to mention the redness in her hair didn't even come close to matching her color in the first film. Thankfully, the make-up and wardrobe department must have heard the complaints from moviegoers that felt the same way about her in "Spiderman 2", and appeared to work harder at matching the hair color from the first film, and actually applying make-up and putting her in clothes that were more stylish and attractive. I mean come on, this is a girl who is supposed to be an actress, yet she dressed in such an unattractive manner that I didn't like seeing her on screen that much, so it was a welcome adjustment in that respect. From a character standpoint, Mary Jane didn't seem to evolve much over the course of this film, her anger at Peter was understandable in certain instances, but in others seemed rather juvenile and out of character. James Franco seemed to really come into his own with Harry Osborn this time around, as he embraced the darker side of his character to become the New Goblin. Other returning favorites, J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, and Rosemary Harris as Aunt May, were enjoyable as always, but I found myself wishing for a little bit more Jonah when this film was all said and done. Joining the cast was Thomas Haden Church ("Sideways") as the villainous Sandman, he definitely looked the part, but sadly he wasn't given as much to do as I would have hoped and his character felt a little underused in favor of giving more attention to the other villains in the story. TV star Topher Grace ("That 70's Show") was perfect as the smooth-talking and morally challenged, Eddie Brock, who begins to develop a hatred for Peter Parker and Spiderman, and eventually comes into contact with the very alien symbiote that is plaguing Peter to become one of comic book fans favorite Spiderman villains of all time, Venom. I enjoyed the addition of Venom as a villain for Spidey, but I thought that he would have been better suited to be the only villain in the movie, rather than sharing the stage with two others, plus I wish they would have chosen to have Venom speak more in his monstrous form instead of having the symbiote pull back to show Topher's face a majority of the time... oh well, nothing's perfect I guess.<br /><br />Another highlight for "Spiderman 3" and the previous two films as well, were the numerous visual effects employed throughout the course of the movie. The effects department was definitely at the top of their game for this movie, the fight scenes were visually stunning and exhilarating, moving at an almost break-neck speed. The CGI for Sandman and Venom was among some of the best I have ever seen captured on film, and you could definitely see that no expense was spared in bringing these popular characters to the screen, and audiences absolutely loved it, regardless of what their overall opinion on the movie may have been.<br /><br />In the end, "Spiderman 3" was an entertaining installment in the franchise, and would be a fitting end to this hero's journey if that is what is decided. However, I must agree that the story did seem a bit bloated at times and some judicious editing could have been done to smooth things out a little more. Although there were times that I found myself wishing for things to have gone differently over the course of the film, overall I enjoyed the experience of watching this movie, and will continue to enjoy it time and time again.<br /><br />"Spiderman 3" is rated PG-13 for mild language and violence.</p></body></html>

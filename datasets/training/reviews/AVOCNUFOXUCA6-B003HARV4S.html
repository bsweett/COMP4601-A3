<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly good"></head><body><p>I watched this movie on an airplane, without high hopes; airline films are often not the best, and having been subjected to nonstop junk on the outward leg, expected the same on the way back.  But I was happily surprised by "The Illusionist."<br /><br />The performances are uniformly excellent.  The characters are well-drawn by the script, and the actors bring out more than one dimension - particularly Giamatti.  I didn't care for the movie "Sideways," but the plus side of that movie is that it got Giamatti some roles that he really deserved and could play well.  The script generally avoids falling into cliche, and sets the movie in a period and location that we haven't seen much of before.  The cinematography is wonderful, having a color theme that doesn't go over the top, and that evokes an old film in parts (frames that go just a little too fast, or are just out of focus for a second).<br /><br />In places, the movie drags a little, but not so much as to knock it down a star.  "The Illusionist" is at least worth a rent.</p></body></html>

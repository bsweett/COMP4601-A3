<meta name="summary" content="WEAKEST OF ALL TERMINATOR FILMS"></head><body><p>Terminator Salvation is the weakest of all the Terminator films, with one exception: Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright - he is terrific. He's even better in Avatar. And this year, he stars in Clash Of The Titans. Something to anticipate. Besides Wright, the film is pretty much just a lot of noise and special effects that don't add up to much. Even Christian Bale is the weakest I've seen him. It's almost as if he knows Wright is stealing the film away from him, and there's nothing he can do about it.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></body></html>

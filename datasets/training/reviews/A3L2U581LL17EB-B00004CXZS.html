<meta name="summary" content="Neither the best nor the worst of Trek."></head><body><p>When I was young 'un (back when I was about 8 or so), The Wrath of Khan was actually my least favorite Star Trek film to date. Having seen it again on TNN recently, I'm not sure why I disliked it so much, and while I won't call it the best Star Trek film (that honor lies with First Contact), it's an entertaining adventure highlighted by good performances, memorable special effects, and two tense, if also somewhat underwhelming, space battles.<p>The Wrath of Khan is a sequel to the episode, "Space Seed", where evil genius Khan and his gang were exiled on a planet. Khan and his group escape, hijack a starship, and plans vengeance upon Kirk. Then there's the genesis device, a machine capable of creating new life, but also has the potential to destroy those the living. It all leads to a tense showdown between the two biggest egos in the universe.<p>There are a lot of things about The Wrath of Khan that still bug me. For one, there's the slow as snails pacing.  Director Nicholas Meyer often said this film was inspired by the nautical adventures of Horatio Hornblower, but I distinctly remember two things that place such works (as seen in, say, the recent Master and Commander) above Wrath of Khan: 1) watching two big spaceships blasting away at each other isn't nearly as fun as seeing two big 19th century warships firing cannonballs upon each other on the high seas and 2) Hornblower often boarded enemy ships, but seeing as this never happens in Wrath of Khan, we're back to the concept of watching two spaceships duking it out.<p>I can't really quite begin to emphasize how small-scale space battles aren't my cup of tea. Not helping that problem is the fact that the Enterprise never actually feels like it's in any genuine danger, not necessarily because you expect that most of the crew will make it through the situation alive, but because it just seems like a far more powerful ship than the Khan-controlled Reliant.  <p>Then there's Khan and his gang of marauders themselves, who look more like rejects from a He-man audition than genuinely menacing villains. Matter of fact, most of Khan's men do little more than stand around and "pose."  They also look a little young for a group that's been marooned for fifteen years, but maybe that's just the side effect of genetic tampering.  This, however, still doesn't explain why Khan himself looks particularly aged from his last encounter with Kirk, and I don't think something as simple as stress caused by survival responsibilities could explain it.  He may be the leader, but if everyone is also as potentially strong and as intelligent as he is, I see no reason why they couldn't care for themselves.<p>The plot generally lacks any sense of urgency.  Even in the thick of the action or in apparently dire situations, the film does little to generate any building suspense.  The Wrath of Khan simply doesn't find the right balance between action, science fiction, and characters.  The only genuine sci-fi on hand (aside from all the space travel and the like) is the Genesis project, and even that takes a backseat to the Kirk/Khan rivalry.<p>Other complaints:  though certain tracks of Horner's score (especially the "prepping for battle" scene) are rousing, too much of the music is just grating and certainly can't hold a candle to Jerry Goldsmith's famed Trek score.  Meyer's camerawork is also rather flat, lacking a sense of true rhythm or energy.  Even Robert Wise's direction in The Motion Picture felt slicker than this.<p>With those criticisms out of the way, there was some stuff I enjoyed about the film. William Shatner and Ricardo Montalban make for an effective protagonist/antagonist duo, with the former delivering a genuinely good performance and the latter chewing the scenery with aplomb. Leonard Nimoy is excellent as Spock, as always. <p>The most memorable scene of the whole film is the emotional climax, which features the death of a major character. This represented the first time that Star Trek could not only engage the mind and rattle the nerves, but also touch the heart (and put a lump in your throat). The Wrath of Khan appears to be the series fan-favorite, and I can see why, but too much of it doesn't click with me. Still, it's somewhat recommended to those looking for a space opera with the occasional dose of action and pathos.</p></body></html>

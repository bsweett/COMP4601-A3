<meta name="summary" content="Shatters the Foundation of Rome"></head><body><p>Harvard Professor Robert Langdon has stumbled upon a terrifying secret: that everything about a Jew named Yeshua (aka Jesus Christ) is false: married to Mary Magdalene, a bloodline in France that lived on through a female child, the sacred feminine, the pagan origins of Rome's christianity, and all sorts of sacred Christian theology all a concoction of The Vatican.<br /><br />While in Paris the murder of the Louvre's curator sparks Langdon and the French detective Sophie to a goose chase of New Testament truths and lies: the Knights Templar, Mary Magdalene, the Priory of Sion, Da Vinci leaving codes in his paintings, and all the secrets that the Vatican will kill to protect. Chased by an albino assassin from Opus Dei named Silas only adds danger to a 2000 year old mystery unvealed in codes, symbols, and secret societies fighting over the truth of Christianity.<br /><br />A spellbinding novel of fiction by Dan Brown that makes a great mystery, tackles religion (especially the Roman Catholic church) and pokes at the Pope as God's representative on Earth, sacraments adopted from Pagan practices, and the salvation that has brought converts into Christ's kingdom since the early days of the apostles.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good remake of a football classic."></head><body><p>This is a remake of the burt reynolds classic from 1974.  I've seen the other movie and liked it, so I thought I would check this one out as well.  I was suprised that I actually enjoyed this movie, and its a great remake of the film. I thought it might be a little over the top with Adam Sandler and Chris Rock, just one bad joke to another, but it wasn't. It was very similar to the original. I think the one thing I enjoyed more about this movie that the original is the fact that they had an actual soundtrack that gave it a more polished feel. I wouldn't have guessed that it would have made that big of a difference, but it does. It's like taking the imperial march out of star wars.  Burt reynolds was able to work his way into this film as Nate scarbourgh role, and did a fine job.  I enjoyed it, 90 minutes of fun.</p></body></html>

The script isn't all that wonderful and I feel the Rosebud thing was a disappointment.  It looks and feels like a magician show.  Money can't buy you love-but if it can get you 9 out of 10 things in life-that ain't bad.  Buy a dog.  They love unconditionally.  If you curious to see what all the hype is about or if you're studying film-then it's worth seeing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wonderfully subtle portrait of a difficult, yet caring man"></head><body><p>This is a phenomenally good film about an elderly man who can come to see things in a new light.  While I think it is too easy to describe him as a racist, he is of the glib, crusty, irascible curmugeon type.  Indeed, he reminds me of my father - hard-edged and seemingly offensive (some people would get hurt and insulted, to be sure), but in fact with a good heart and natural nobility.  Eastwood plays it with unmistakable charisma.  I marvelled at the skill with which Eastwood pealed away layers of his character, from his crudeness to his soul-searching and ethic of community.<br /><br />The situation is that, his wife having died and his sons alienated, he is wondering what to do with himself.  He is rude to his Hmong neighbors, but comes to see them as truly worthy people in need of help and nurturing.  His evolution from suspicion and a playful hostility with the Hmong grandmother are totally believable.  In particular, he befirends a boy who is at a crossroads, even taking him to a barber in order to teach him how to trade manly insults.  Their chemistry as it evolves is beautiful, to the point of bringing tears to my eyes.  When his plans to help go awry, he hatches a very clever plan.<br /><br />I watched this twice and was moved each time and noticed more detail.  It is a masterpiece and an unusual story for Hollywood to do.  Warmly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dragging, but good."></head><body><p>The first half of this movie is very Quinten Tarantino, the dialogue and the way everything is paced reminds me of his other movies alot.  The second half drops a little in quality and the dialogue that is Tarantino becomes average TV movie talk.  Harvey Keitel would have been alot better without his Texas accent, but he was still good.  Tarantino's character was interesting and not what I would have expected, but I wish that they would've spent more time on him once he turned into a vampire.  George Clooney's character, Seth, was exactly like every other character I've seen him play.  Clooney is probably one of the least versatile actors I know of.  As this is a Robert Rodriguez film it wouldn't be complete without his leading lady, Salma Hayek.  This film contains a scene featuring her for not long enough, but it's definately a high point in the movie for any male.  As this is a vampire movie, and it is sold as a vampire movie, one of the things preventing me from classifying it as "Very Good" is the fact that vampires really don't have a big part in it at all.  Sure, they have a long stretch (featuring Tom Savini acting, which is great) but the film doesn't have the feel of a vampire movie's sense of dread.  It may be funny at times, but the vampires aren't used enough throughout the story as a threat.  The police are played up as more of an enemy as the vampires, and that to me is sad.  Another thing is that this movie is about 1 hr. 40 minutes or so, yet it feels like a movie drags on forever.  Anyway, it's still an entertaining film and I recommend it to anyone interested, but I cannot in anyway guarantee that you will enjoy it.<br /><br />NOTE:<br /><br />This film is for no one under 13 years old.</p></body></html>

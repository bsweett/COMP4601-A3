<meta name="summary" content="Kee: "I'll call my baby Dylan. It's a girl's name, too.""></head><body><p>Monday afternoon I had one of those rare movie-watching experiences: a film I'd never heard of that absolutely amazed me. In fact, CHILDREN OF MEN (Japan/USA/UK-2006) is EASILY the best motion picture I've seen this year.<br /><br />I'm not much of a sci-fi fan and had my doubts, especially during the story's first half-hour, but what came later was so mind-bogglling, so unique, that I won't dare ruin it for anyone who hasn't yet seen this superb work.<br /><br />It's set in the dystopian world of 2027. The last child to be born was 18 years earlier and no one knows why women can no longer conceive, thus the human race is on the brink of extinction through natural attrition.<br /><br />Theo (Clive Owen) is hired to escort an illegal to England's coast. Against all odds, the African-born Kee (Clare-Hope Ash?tey) is eight-months pregnant, which makes her the hope of our entire planet. There are some who wish to exploit Kee and others want her dead. Theo and a handful of friends, including eccentric hippe  Jasper (Michael Caine) and Theo's ex, Julian (Julianne Moore), are her only chance for escape and safety.<br /><br />Once the pursuit begins you will witness things you've never seen before, including one inspiring moment in the midst of total chaotic war.<br /><br />WHAT a movie! I just now bought a copy for my home library.</p></body></html>

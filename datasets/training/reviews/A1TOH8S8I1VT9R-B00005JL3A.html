<meta name="summary" content="YOU CAN'T JUDGE A FILM BY IT'S GAME.  HIGHLY UNDERRATED!!"></head><body><p>I've read many of the reviews here at amazon.com.  I find it interesting how what is considered "a minor film" has brought on so many "Love it"/"Hate it" opinions.  I (a non-gamer) fall in the "Love it" group.  I've read criticisms of the beginning of the film and how it is hard to follow.  It seamed quite apparent (to me) that you were supposed to be confused in the beginning so you could identify with the main character that has lost her memory.  I thought it actually brilliant how things become clearer to the viewer as the effects of the knockout gas wear off of Mila Jovovich's character.  I am also surprised that people can watch a video-game based film and have such high expectations.  I went into this thinking, "I sure hope there's a lot of special effects and good action".  I came out of viewing my rental thinking, "That was so much better than I expected, I must own this!!"  Heck, I thought "Mortal Kombat" was a passable video game adaptation; Full of action, had a story, fair acting.  I'm not sure what people expect when a film like this comes out.<br /><br />Here's my reasoning behind supporting this DVD;<br />-There is actually a story in this film and it requires your strict attention.<br />-Better than average acting for a film of this genre.<br />-Visually stunning.  Pay attention to how color (and the lack of) is used.<br />-So it has a metal soundtrack... what did you expect?<br />-Sound quality is very good.  "Whisper" in the vent is very subtle and creepy.<br />-I have never played the game.  This is the film, not the game.<br /><br />What to look for;<br />-Not much gore.  Some will find this disappointing.  I personally don't think it matters.  There is an ample supply of blood however.<br />-More tension and suspense than scares.  I think this film has a great emotional edge to it.<br />-Great character development.  You might care when they die.<br />-George Romero Zombie rules are in effect; Blow to the head, infect with bites or scratches, and eat the living.<br /><br />-Laser room is a great moment in horror film history.  If it does not freak you out, then I don't know what craziness you've witnessed.<br />-Plenty of good extras for the money.<br /><br />I personally looked at this as a film, without consideration to the video game.  That comparison is no more fair than comparing "Lord of The Rings" films to the books.  Sure, we all want a reasonable level of "faithfulness", just be fair to what you are looking at.  I believe the only fair way to judge a film is to keep the media separated.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?""></head><body><p>Vietnam veteran and current hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin in a star making role) has a problem.  He's stumbled upon two million dollars in cash after finding the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, and soon enough finds himself hunted by the insanely calm, coin tossing Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem in his Oscar winning role) in 1980 Texas.  In the meantime, World War II vet Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) attempts to get to Moss and his wife (Kelly MacDonald) before Chigurh does, as the end comes sooner for some others, and the film offers shock after shock, with the Coen Brothers cementing their legacy for unconventional film making.  Possibly one of the most bleak Best Picture winners you'll ever see, the Coen Brothers' No Country for Old Men is a restrained, violent, and starkly poetic vision that could easily be considered a dark, modern-day western if nothing else.  What makes No Country for Old Men so good is the cast of the film, with Bardem and Brolin in particular giving finely nuanced performances, possibly the best of their careers.  Also featuring Woody Harrelson and Garret Dillahunt, No Country for Old Men is definitely not a film for everyone to be sure (as you can tell from reading the negative reviews here).  Those expecting a mainstream crowd pleaser here have certainly come to the wrong place.  However, saying that the film deserves a chance is an understatement, as movies like No Country for Old Men just don't see the light of day too often.  In that respect alone, the Coen Brothers' latest is a masterpiece of modern film making.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="How a smaller market team defied the odds and changed the game in the process"></head><body><p>How do you build a championship team with smaller resources than other teams? "Moneyball" based on the book by Michael Lewis that documented how General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt)for the Oakland A's used an unconvetional approach to put together a team on a budget--using computer analysis to draft players that will fill their slots but still allow them to reach their goal of the play-offs and, perhaps, the World Series. Since Bean can't afford the team that the Yankees can he has to find a way to out play them by finding undervalued players.<br />Beane taps Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) to help him find those players that can provide them what they need--to get on base and make runs.<br /><br />Pitt does a terrific job as Beane a former major league player who "had it all" but didn't end up living up to his potential. Pitt is ably supported by Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the team's manager who has an adversarial relationship<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks magnificent on Blu-ray with a sharp, colorful transfer with great depth and textures (this, of course, is the case for the film itself not for the TV footage that shows up in the film).<br /><br />Audio sounds terrific with an immersive DTS lossless 5.1 presentation that puts audio action all around your system. The film also features subtitles in English.<br /><br />The special features for this set are quite good as well. "Drafting The Team" focuses on casting the movie while "Adapting Moneyball" focuses on the challanges of making the non-fiction book into a dramatic film and combining two different drafts of the script one written by Aaron Sorkin and the other written by Steven Zallian. "Reinventing The Game" focuses on how Beane's approach helped revolutionize the game having an impact that helped other smaller market teams to make it to the World Series. "Playing The Game" focuses on MLB's involvement in making the film.<br /><br />Finally we get a couple of extended/alternate scenes as well as a brief gag reel.<br /><br />The set also includes a standard DVD as well as the dreaded Ultra Violet copy that allows you to stream the film (but only while online and only if you have an account which really does suck for those who want to watch this on their portable device).<br /><br />You don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy "Moneyball" which gives us the story of an underdog team and their GM's attempt to give them some parity withy the big city teams.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

The movie is filmed perfectly, has some outstanding acting and memorable characters, and completely succeeds at entertaining and creeping out its audience during its run time.<br /><br />A marvelous and original idea. The performances are all great, and contain many great cameos from many 80's Tv and movie stars. Such cameos include PJ SOLES (Halloween, Carrie, Rock N Roll High School) Elizabeth Daly -credited as EG DALY (Valley Girl, Pee Wees Big Adventure) and Priscilla Barnes (Threes Company).<br /><br />Thanks Rob, for giving us horror fans a film that we can love and that you can most definately be proud of.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</p></body></html>

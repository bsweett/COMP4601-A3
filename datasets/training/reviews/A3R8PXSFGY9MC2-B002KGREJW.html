<meta name="summary" content="Little Miss Sunshine"></head><body><p>Let me start by saying 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a quirky, yet delightful gem. I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did but this is one of those films that keeps you engrossed throughout and leaves you feeling good at the end. The story is pretty original and all the actors do an amazing job, especially the young girl who plays Olive and Steve Carell in a more serious role for him, rather than the usual slapstick he does. At just over 90 minutes this film is perfect for those lazy afternoons and although there are many laugh out loud moments, there are also some warm and touching moments as well. A great little film that is well worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

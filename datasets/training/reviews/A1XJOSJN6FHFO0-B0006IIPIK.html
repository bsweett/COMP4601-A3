I know that sounds strange, but I think the main charcter Polly, who was a top reporter in a major city, reminded me of Lois Lane. Of course Sky Captain flew a plane but for some reason he reminded me of Jones.<br /><br />The main theme of the story is that a madman scientist has built an ark filled with animals and is planning to go out to space and destroy the world on his way.  Of course our couple must stop his plans.<br /><br />The movie has a surprise ending concerning the scientist and I think the ending was great. It has a tad of romance, plenty of adventure and some humor as well.  All in all an enjoyable show.</p></body></html>

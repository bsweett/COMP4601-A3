This movie is not a horror story at all. In fact, it's more of a courtroom drama if you will. The film is centered around a catholic priest named Father Moore played brilliantly by Tom Wilkinson. Father Moore is being prosecuted and standing trial because the exorcism he performed on teenage Emily Rose resulted in her death. This is where medicine versus spirituality begins. This movie was done brilliantly because it's not told from a biased prospective. It doesn't try to persuade you to see it from one prospective or the other because both sides are equally expressed. This movie wanted to be politically correct, and it didn't wanna ruffle any feathers from either side. Meanwhile, showing the viewers both sides of the story from two different points of view. By the end of this movie we still can't be sure what actually happened to Emily Rose. Was it demonic possession? or Was it pychosis? However, I will say this, even the non-believers must admit that some of the prosecutions arguements were too far-fetched. Then again, there's always gonna be the so-called "realists" who think that there's a scientific explanation for everything, and then there are "spiritualist" who think that there's a higher power that goes beyond medicine. I am on that side because what I saw was clearly demonic possession, but that's just an opinion, and we all know what they're like. I thought the ending was most impressive because I sat in the theatre waiting for a more in depth explanation as to why the demons attacked her in particular, and in the end that question was answered. Father Moore took the stand and read Emily's final letter that she wrote just before she died. I thought it was so interesting that after a failed attempt to drive the demons out. After Emily's body had been starved, beaten, worn, and attacked by a legion of demons she actually got to see the "Virgin Mary" Of course, she wants to know why she's suffering this way, and of couse it's because she's a "saint" or meant to do God's work. At this time she's given a choice to die and be delivered from all her suffering, or she could stay and be a martyr thus continuing to suffer even more, but the demons still weren't gonna leave her body. At this point, Emily chose to stay, and at that time I thought it was very foolish. However, in hindsight I see it was a very courageous thing to endure. Emily chose to suffer so that her story could be told to the world. So that everyone would know that demons do exist. That was Father Moore's sole purpose to make sure Emily's message got delivered. On the other hand, you have the prosecuters expecting us to believe that Emily's behavior is another form of psychosis or epilepsy treatable by proper medication. They're trying their best to get us to believe that the rest were just muscle constrictions and elevated voices. They want us to believe there was nothing "spiritual" about this whole ordeal. Emily was not possessed, and she didn't suffer the stigmata because she was a person ordained by God, but she wondered outside in a daze and grabbed some barbed wire thus getting the wounds on both her hands. They want us to believe that she stopped taking her medicine that the doctor prescribed, and that's why she is indeed going crazy. In my opinion, that's ridiculous! They didn't wanna entertain the possibility of demonic possession, but they could entertain the thought of that other crap.</p></body></html>

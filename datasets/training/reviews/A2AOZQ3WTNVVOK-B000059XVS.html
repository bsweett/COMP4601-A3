<meta name="summary" content="One of the Greatest Films Ever (Region 2 DVD)"></head><body><p>It is difficult to describe one of the greatest films of all time. This film may even be the greatest film of all time. Such sweeping statements are difficult to defend because opinions are exactly that. Yet, this movie has much going for it that make it a must for any greatest films list, and makes the top of mine.<br /><br />Let us begin with the peripherals. At a time when sets were common, this movie was filmed entirely on location. The desert scenes are all real. I believe the interiors were all real buildings, though I can not verify that. The music, most especially the theme, is unbelievable. The soaring violins are well matched to the expansive desert vistas, stretching away into infinity. The Arabian deserts are as immense as the American west. Also important were the costumes, which were highly detailed and apparently authentic. Each and every aspect of this movie was so exceedingly well executed that it approaches perfection. In one of the DVD extras Peter O'Toole mentions that he was expecting to be filming this movie for five months, and instead ended up filming it for two years and three months, one indication of the care and complexity required to create this film.<br /><br />If you have yet to buy this movie, then please do two things. First, if at all possible for your region, buy the two-disk DVD with the marvelous extras. The black and white documentaries are short but interesting. The interviews provide insight into those involved with the film. Second, buy the biggest television set you possibly can, and be sure you watch this movie in wide screen format. You miss too much with full screen. In fact, the optimal way to watch this movie is to have a surround sound system and an HDTV set up for wide screen format.<br /><br />The movie itself is a classic of classics, the story of an English map maker in service to his country. Bored by what he is doing, he wants to see some action. Soon he does, but the action changes him. The movie is about how T. E. Lawrence grows from an idealistic young man to a battle hardened man who discovers that he likes killing, and yet is repulsed by it. The movie also proclaims that T. E. Lawrence was one of the principals involved in Arab independence and the movie is about some of the seminal moments in the uniting of many Arab tribes. The movie also provides as much information about Lawrence's psychology as it does about his actions, because his psychology, from being able to put out a match with his bare fingers to calling for the elimination of a fleeing column of Turkish troops with the taking of no prisoners, provides insights into the complex psyche of the person of T. E. Lawrence.<br /><br />The battles are exquisitely executed. The fights are extremely well choreographed, and I admire the stamina and dedication of the hundreds of people involved in the creation of this movie as they created this movie in desert temperatures. Given the care that is taken with safety in modern films, I believe this movie would be extremely difficult to film in the same way today.<br /><br />Ultimately, the art, the story, the locations, the music, the script, the costumes and the action all come together to create an incredibly compelling and realistic story of T. E. Lawrence. This movie is a must-have for a collector of great films.</p></body></html>

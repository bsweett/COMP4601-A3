I don't like this question.  Now, I have not seen this new Shrek film as of yet, but I feel compelled to defend the third film now since, in my opinion, it was far from disappointing.<br /><br />In fact, both my wife and I concluded that this was better than the second Shrek film.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Shrek becoming heir to the throne of Far, Far Away when Fiona's father dies.  He's not really suited for the Kingly life so he sets out on a journey to find Arthur, the only other heir to the throne, and bring him back to claim his place.  There are a few problems.  Arthur (or Artie as he is better known) is a rebellious teen who isn't really suited for Kingly duties either.  You also have the bitter Prince Charming who is determined to overtake the throne, even if that means imprisoning the recently impregnated Fiona.<br /><br />Well, it's not like Fiona can't take care of herself.<br /><br />If any of the Shrek films meandered or lost steam it was the second film.  For me, `Shrek the Third' was a step in the right direction.  Sure, it isn't as fresh or exciting as the first film, but none of them have been.  BUT, this film is funny, witty and charming.  The voice performances by the entire cast (including the newbie, Timberlake) are all top notch, and the gags here are one laugh after another.<br /><br />I know it's been noted, but that whole `Puss-in-Boots swapping bodies with Donkey' scene is hilarious!<br /><br />I don't get the hate here.  It really makes very little sense to me.  The film is entertaining from start to finish and capitalizes on everything that makes these Shrek movies so fun and engaging.  I understand that people may have been expecting more, but in the end this film really does deliver a memorable good time.</p></body></html>

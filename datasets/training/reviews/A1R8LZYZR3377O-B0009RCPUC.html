<meta name="summary" content=""THE WAR IS LOST...DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE""></head><body><p>A superior war movie. As an English speaking person, the German language spoken throughout the film added an extra intensity to the drama unfolding. I have always wanted to see a state of the art film of Hitlers last days in the bunker. Already  knowing history it is facinating to see the impending doom of the Nazi army. Bruno Ganz plays hitlerwith all his idiosyncrasies unnervingly. Observing Hitlers emotions while he realizes his demise is near plays out in an engrossing fashion. I thought the film jumped around a bit much, but considering the amount of charactors covered it seems somewhat reasonable. The scene where the children are "mercifully" killed is very disturbing. However realism is in full effect in this movie so be warned. The blending of sorrow among the SS and others mixed with the outward brutality towards life is strange. But, this is a hard edged war film of the best kind. The city of Berlins war torn streets are striking images that are well filmed. Another aspect to the movie is that it is shot through the eyes of Hitlers personel secretary who was alive as of recently and gives a pre&post film commentary. Reading the subtitles really bring you into the movie, and the dialogue is superb. The film could have been perfect save a few unnecessarily drawn out scenes. Most of the German actors really captured their rolls exceedingly well. The dvd audio is stunning. The sounds of weaponry inside and out of the bunker place you right there. The picture quality is sharp. I suggest you watch this on a high end widescreen tv with an HDMI hookup for maximum viseral impact. Like all films it's not for everyone(especially the historically and artistically stunted)but for those it's for...watch out.</p></body></html>

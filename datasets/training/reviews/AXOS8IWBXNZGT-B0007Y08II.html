<meta name="summary" content="Team America: Mixed Message"></head><body><p>I was lent a copy of Team America: World Police for the weekend, and just finished watching it. It's a marionette movie, which I've never seen before, and it's from the occasionally funny creators of South Park.<br /><br />Move premise: Team America is a not-so-super-secret team of do-gooders, acting to thwart terrorism around the globe. In the opening sequence, a member of the team is killed in an operation in Paris, and a new member is recruited, an actor in a popular Broadway show. The terrorists' plans are still in play, and the team must defeat the terrorists, and their evil mastermind, and save the world.<br /><br />At heart, this movie is supposed to be a satire. The movie's creators do delight in skewering everyone and everything in sight: the left and right wings, American blindness to how their actions are viewed by those abroad, and several well-known film actors. The efforts do fall short of satire, however; satire should carry that feeling of...subversiveness, and instead you just get the sense that the characters are blundering through life, Clouseau-fashion.<br /><br />The movie is funny at times, though be forewarned as the humour is crude and bawdy and did I mention crude? Puppet sex had me laughing out loud! Don't be showing this movie to kids; there's a reason it's rated "R". There's no true intellectual humour here, as one would hope with a satire (and one would get with a satire such as Dr. Strangelove).<br /><br />I should mention that the opening sequence rubbed me the wrong way a little bit, especially after having read Is Paris Burning? recently. The City of Lights deserves to be treated with more care, and certainly should be portrayed more accurately.<br /><br />This would be one of those "see on an airplane" movies, but the odds of this happening are pretty much nil.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not wondrous or inspiring, but really really good"></head><body><p>I mean it's no masterpiece, but it's a really good movie.  Tom Hanks has been better many times, and is quite frankly miscast as a big old tough guy.  Jennifer Jason Leigh, well, she's my favorite actress (Unite ladies!), but it's unusual that she doesn't have a few more scenes.  I keep forgetting my favorite actress is in this movie.<p>Jude Law and Paul Newman literally walk away with this movie.  I'm not sure why Jude wasn't nominated alongside Newman, after all he was nominated for Mr. Ripley a few years ago.  But Newman dominates this movie with his gruff old-timer persona.  What a legend, and a real rare gentleman from what I'm told.<p>This is an Oscar winning film, as the stunning cinematography was recognized.  And rightly so, because this is a beaut.  For weird reasons, the sound was nominated which is kind of silly because the movie is so quiet I found myself lulled to sleep in some of the boring spots (trust me, there are a few).  <p>I hate special features on dvds, so I was glad to see that there are not many included on this release.  They are just a waste of time and I never view them.  Why would I want to hear somebody talk while I watch the movie?  Commentary tracks are annoying, and that's not just my opinion.  I put this one on for about 3 minutes, just to hear how pretentious Sam Mendes British accent is.  And it certainly is.  If you really want to watch this movie in style, get some Newman's Own snacks like his awesome Orange chocolate chip cookies, which I understand he personally supervises.<p>This movie is not ever going to be looked at as a classic of the gangster genre, and the violence is unfortunately subdued.  Ever since Goodfellas gave us such in-your-face bloodiness, it has become a contest to see who can really top the gore quotient.  Well, this one falls far short and will likely leave hard-core gangster film fans very dissapointed.  But the music is almost enough to make up for it, and was deservedly nominated for an Oscar (AKA Academy Award).<p>A fool will buy this, but a real smart person will rent it, maybe more than once over time.</p></body></html>

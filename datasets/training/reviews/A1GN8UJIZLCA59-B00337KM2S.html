<meta name="summary" content="Take a Trip with Clooney & Friends"></head><body><p>Jason Reitman's Up In The Air deftly balances a light comedic approach with the stark reality of today's down economic times.  George Clooney is at his confident & charming best as Ryan Bingham a hired corporate hatchet man who fires people for a living and spends about 320 a year on the road.  Ryan has created a bubble for himself where he has essentially shut himself off from any personal relationships including his family and has stripped himself of most of his possessions to those only of essence to his work existence.  He meets the sexy and smart Alex (Vera Farmiga) on one of his trips and they set His world is threatened to collapse when a young Ivy Leaguer, Natalie (Anna Kendrick) joins his company and pitches an idea to eliminate the need to go on the road by doing the firings over the internet.  Ryan balks at the idea and reluctantly takes Natalie on the road to show her the ropes.  Along the way Ryan starts to break out of his self-imposed cocoon and see that people and personal relationships are important.  Mr. Clooney, Ms. Farmiga and Ms. Kendrick all give Oscar worthy performances and the rest of the cast is equally appealing including Jason Bateman as Ryan & Natalie's somewhat sleazy boss and Danny McBride as Ryan's soon to be brother-in-law.  J.K. Simmons has a hilarious and poignant cameo as one the people Ryan & Natalie fire as does Zach Galifianakis in the opening scene as the first person we see Ryan fire.  Up In The Air is a movie set in the current economic times, but contains timeless performances that will make you laugh and maybe even bring a tear to your eye.</p></body></html>

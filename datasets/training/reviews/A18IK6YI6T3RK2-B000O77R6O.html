It oscilates between three different story lines that converge.  It's a tribute to the director and the talent that this works at all.  I had read that Brad Pitt had been slated to star it this film, but that he had to bow out because of the long pre production, though im sure Pitt would have done and interesting turn in this role, I really can't imagine anybody but Jackman making this metaphysical script work:  thanks Brad for following Angella all over Africa and letting the role fall by default to the singular Jackman.  I recommend this movie, but watch it with an open mind, you may learn something..imagine that.</p></body></html>

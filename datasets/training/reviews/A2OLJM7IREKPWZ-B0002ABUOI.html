<meta name="summary" content="a bloddy gorefest that will truly dialate your pupils"></head><body><p>This is so intense that I can't believe what I saw<br /><br />even the scene with the sexy woman with her husband giving birth is freaky. Cuz she turns into a zombie in between the birth and he's still wanting the baby. and then later he gets shot. But before that he has to kill his wife before she gets off the bed and turn him into one. It is one intense movie. Alot of the gore scenes had my pupils enlargening by the second<br /><br />That's how intense and great this movie is. Scary as can be. Intensely great plot. Creepy as heck scenes with the zombies devouring and slaughtering humans. Not to mention all the fatalities. I think this will stay a classic 120 years from now. although I probably won't live to be 120 years old. you can count on this being watched more and more and more every chance I get. It chillled my blood. Dialated my pupils. made my jaw drop wide open more times then I can count. This should get a whole bunch of movie awards if it hasn't already. This is truly one freaky and interesting horror movie. I was hooked from beginning to end :)<br /><br />If you like horror movies with Zombies. see : Dawn of the dead, House of the dead, Night of the living dead, Return of the living dead, and so many others I can't even think of<br /><br />This is one intense movie that was so worth the buy on dvd. I am so glad I saw the trailer. this movie is soooooooo intense</p></body></html>

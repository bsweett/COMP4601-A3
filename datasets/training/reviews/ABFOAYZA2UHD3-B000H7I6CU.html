<meta name="summary" content="love this movie"></head><body><p>my son does too. we have been watching it again and again and again for the last 3 days, and neither has gotten tired of it yet.<br /><br />why we love it?<br /><br />cause of the way cars are made into persons by means of graphics (the expressions and "faces" thay have and make) and acting.<br /><br />cause of the story - it's warm and fuzzy and funny :)<br /><br />cause of the way story is paced; it never gets boring and slow, but it doesn't kill you with the tempo either.<br /><br />cause its beautifully done (not to say "drawn, cause we know it isn't just drawing any more) - the characters, the details on them, the city, racetrack, nature..<br /><br />one of my all-time favorites.</p></body></html>

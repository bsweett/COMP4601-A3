<meta name="summary" content=""You stole my story...""></head><body><p>This was a very good suspense film, and I have to say that Johnny Depp turns in another great performance. John Tuturro is great as well, and his scary hick character, Shooter, is very creepy. David Koepp is a good director and screenwriter. See STIR OF ECHOES and PANIC ROOM for good examples of this. I really liked the twist at the end, and even though you will think that you've seen it all before, you should not come out feeling disappointed with it. I thought it was extremely creepy in a very quirky way...if that makes any sense.<p>Anyways, great performances and a good script make this worth the ticket price.<p>Recommended!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Alfred Hitchcock never disappoints"></head><body><p>It is difficult for me to decide which of Alfred Hitchcock's films is best. They are all excellent - masterpieces.<br /><br />Rear Window boasts a strong casting compliment, a solid story line, and a master director to make it all fly off the screen. From a short story of only thirty pages by Cornell Woolrich, the chill of murder was never colder.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart is convalescing and confined to a wheelchair. His girl friend (Grace Kelley) visits, sometimes cooks, sometimes has dinner sent in. Jimmy Stewart is a photographer and as such has a natural curiosity. The rear window of his apartment faces a courtyard and the rear windows of various other apartments. He knows just about all the neighbors by eavesdropping or peeping as it may be called. One day, he notices something very strange at Raymond Burr's apartment. The wife does not seem to be there anymore, the curtains drawn where they never were before, and Burr acting jumpy, making trips out of the apartment with a suitcase, clearing the way with suspicious eyes.<br /><br />Well, there are the opening minutes and now, suspense is a sure thing.<br /><br />This film is a must for Hitchcock fans to enjoy over and over again. To those not yet fans, what are you waiting for?</p></body></html>

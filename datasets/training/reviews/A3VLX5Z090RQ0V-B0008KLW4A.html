That's Not Right"></head><body><p>"Catwoman" is so repulsive, it made anime catgirls who watched it hack up feces and throw the content at a hero's face, and then have him scratched into pieces.  It's a amalgamation of Warner Bros' heinously-produced superhero movies of the past, thinly-disguised as an empowering chick flick.  Not to mention the public attention of having one of the worst superhero costumes ever, but to be fair, despite looking like a dominatrix mouse with clothes taken from a thrift store, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1563899086">at least she didn't wear those ugly goggles</a>.  It's kind sad that such attention goes for such a wear, because she actually work a decent 'prototype' costume before her official wardrobe disaster: it was a tight leather pants (unshredded) and a long-sleeve jacket followed by black mask; she looked presentable, and she didn't seem less agile wearing more clothes than she does wearing less.  If she just cover her head with a bandana (and wearing cat ears), that would've been the right costume for her, but no, she wanted to look like a laughingstock to even perverts.<br /><br />It's about a not-Selena Kyle named Patience (Berry), a weedy design for ads in a big make-up business owned by a rich jerk and her wife, the latter played by a not-looking-good-in-her-older-years Sharon Stone.  When Patience was about to fall from her apartment after saving a mysterious cat, she was rescued by detective named Rico Suave---that's not his actual name, but Benjamin Bratt played a character who did nothing but coming on to the lead actress, so that name is appropriate.  Later, Patience went into a make-up facility when she overheard that her company's new product is tainted and dangerous for anyone who tried it; she was killed as a result.  And then came the stupidest plot-device happened: the same mysterious cat walk on her corpse, YAWNED AT HER FACE, and not only did it revived her, it gave her acute senses and extreme agility.  But such dexterity comes as a price when she has to carry all of the quirks of a cat; walking on thin ledges on her own two feet, having an obsessive craving for fish, having dogs bark at her, and having a fear of rain.  Oh, and she can teleport from one place to another, though that sounds more like a magician that a cat's ability.<br /><br />I wish I didn't make this sound stupid, but it really is.  What's next, does she bath herself with her tongue and does she breed 3 litters after 3 months?  Not even a few comics I read and some cartoons I've seen painted "Catwoman" in such a literal manner.  The stupidity didn't help but how warped the film is directed.  It seems like Pitof, the film's director, has see the first "Spider-Man" and wanted to imitate its free-flowing camera angles.  Except he wanted to use more of that style, whether it be backgrounds shots, interiors, character POVs, third-person perspective, wherever it can move around. This approach to filming is so tacky and distracting, it actually makes the film look fake (especially during Catwoman jumping across buildings); half the time I thought I was watching a 3D-animated movie, except this is live-action.  Editing is another seque to nitpick.  Some of the scene edits are weird, like that one scene where the guy was taking, and the scene keeps cutting to the same character in the same position (i.e. opening scene for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6302261589">"Cool As Ice"</a>).  Sometimes, the film even has a few goofs, like when a burglar tried to break a glass class with his gun, but the glass case was smashed before his gun even made impact; it's a notable goof, and it's been done twice!<br /><br />Halle Berry tried to do something with her character, but she was totally boned.  She made horrible puns, her assertive attitude is laughable, and she did nothing to make Catwoman act sexual as well as appear sexual; she can be even too enamored with herself, like when her superego is dancing around on the center of a club stage and is lashing her whip around.  The story was stupid, the acting was weak, and fights are meandering.  "Catwoman" failed to be a provocative movie as well as being popcorn entertainment.</p></body></html>

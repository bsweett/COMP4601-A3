<meta name="summary" content="When enough is not enough"></head><body><p>It's 1955, and Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) are a successful, young suburban couple.  They also both feel doomed in their lives; he hates his job and she always wanted to be an actress but ended up an ordinary housewife. Excitement does come back into their lives, however, when they decide to move to Paris and do all the things they once wanted to do, but life has a way of spoiling even the best of plans.<br /><br />Based on Richard Yate's seminal novel about suburban discontent, the movie has the same plot but lacks the author's sly, witty observations acknowledging the irony of people being unfulfilled amid relative luxury, luxury made possible by rigidly conforming to the expectations of society.  DiCaprio and Winslet both do competent jobs; he has a more sympathetic role, looking quite young but handsome, while she plays a desperate shrew, looking much older and being the only woman in the cast not to have the 50's look in hair and make-up.  The period is otherwise wonderfully reproduced and the movie is photographed with a lot of natural sunlight that gives a yellowed, washed-out look, befitting a story about hopelessness.<br /><br />While not as memorable as the novel, the movie is still a well-made character study.  Because there isn't much action, it feels like a staged play much of the time and it's hard to feel sorry for people who seem to have it all and still want more.  As a couple, Leo and Kate don't recreate the romantic magic of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JLWW">Titanic</a>, but they do prove to be fine actors.</p></body></html>

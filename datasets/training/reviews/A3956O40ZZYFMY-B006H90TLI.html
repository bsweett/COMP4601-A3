<meta name="summary" content="Should have "launched" Bardem"></head><body><p>When I saw this movie upon its theatrical release I was sure it would finally launch Javier Bardem as a Hollywood actor of much demand. I had seen the man master several foreign film roles and was happy to see him in this Coen Brothers release. He did nothing different than he had in every foreign film I had seen him in, single handedly making the film great by way of applying his superb acting "chops". His skill even allowed one to forget the rather eccentric movie making efforts of Coen Brothers films, truly quite the accomplishment itself. The film and the actor were recognized for the obvious but as several years have now passed since the films release, Hollywood maintains its famed flaw of failing to recognize and take advantage of true acting skill. How many miserable Nicolas Cage movies have come and gone, or mindless DeCaprio vehicles similarly popping up and quickly being forgotten since No Country For Old Men was released with nothing but a void from Hollywood for films featuring the vastly more skilled Bardem?<br />I digress and am merely wool-gathering though. No Country For Old Men is a must see. Easily the best film of its year and at least for me, a film that will never be forgotten. Rent it, buy it, steal it...anything is worth the cost to see this great film. Forget the popcorn, it will sit unbothered, growing cold and stale while this fine film takes the viewer on a journey never to be forgotten.</p></body></html>

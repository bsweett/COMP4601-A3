<meta name="summary" content="An excellent, well thought-out film..."></head><body><p>"Training Day" may very well be the smartest cop drama in recent history. Denzel Washington gives an Academy Award-winning performance as Alonzo, a hard-edged street cop whose specialty is narcotics. Ethan Hawke plays his rookie of the day who is fresh from training and is green in the field. The film, as the title implies, follows our characters for a day and we see Alonzo do some things we're not sure we want cops doing, such as drinking and driving, stealing money, and taking drugs. While the film's ending is highly predictable and even inevitable, it still leaves a strong impact on the audience. Denzel Washington is completely outstanding as the narcotics detective. This really is a hugely different role for him and he handles it effortlessly, putting him among other film tough-guys like DeNiro, Humphrey Bogart, Al Pacino, and Sean Connery. Washington glows on the screen, steals the show from an already-outstanding cast and flexes those acting muscles like he never has before. Some people questioned his getting the Oscar for this movie. I don't. This is the best performance so far in his career. Director Antoine Fuqua also does a splendid job in keeping the film fluid, fast, and furious. There are touches of humor mixed with scenes of violence. Very rarely does a director really flesh out the surroundings and setting the way Fuqua has done here. "Training Day" is one of the best films of 2001 and shouldn't be missed at all.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Friday the 13th  ~ Betsy Palmer"></head><body><p>Friday the 13th~ Betsy Palmer is one of the first slasher movies and for a slasher flick it is not half bad. The music is horrid and sounds like it was a high-school project gone bad. The dialog is not as bad as in later movies. Kevin Bacon is the only one in this movie that actually had a career after this movie and many of the people that starred in this movie are unknown today. Gotta love the killer cam and the arrowhead through the throat that kills Bacons character Jack. Even so it is amazing that this is the best in the series consider that the acting is on a high-school level and they seem to have all but Bacon and Mrs Vorhees (Betsy Palmer) gone to Hollywood upstairs acting school. Recommended for people that like slasher movies. However, do not expect a stellar script, advanced dialog or a plot that makes sense. Good simple slasher movie and should be seen as such.</p></body></html>

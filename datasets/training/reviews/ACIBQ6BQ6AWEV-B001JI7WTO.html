<meta name="summary" content="Mildly Entertaining Riff On The Jules Verne Classic"></head><body><p>About once every decade or so the motion picture industry decides to revisit 3-D technology, and one of the properties chosen for this occasion was Jules Verne's classic JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH.  Originally published in 1864, the story has been through more screen and television adaptations than you can shake a stick at--most famously in a 1959 big screen adaptation starring James Mason.  The current version, however, is not a literal adaptation of the novel; it is instead a modern riff that finds scientest Trevor Anderson (Brandon Fraser) using his late brother's notes on the Jules Verne novel in an effort to revive interest in his own dying university program.<br /><br />With smart-alec nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and hiking guide Hannah (Anita Briem) in tow, Trevor stumbles into a cave that leads to an old mine that unexpectedly drops them to the center of the earth, where they find Verne was right all along.  Along the way they encounter a wild mine cart ride, a man-eating plant, a T-Rex, and lots of other bits of business designed to show off the 3-D effects.<br /><br />3-D is really a big screen format, and when to bring it to the small screen the result is only so-so.  The glasses are as annoying as ever, especially if you wear glasses yourself; be that as it may, it works fairly well as long you keep the room completely dark and sit directly in front of the television.  You may have to move further back or closer to the screen for best viewing.  This aside, JOURNEY is a flyweight thing, well-designed, reasonably well-acted, but with a trivial script and story that exist only to provide an excuse for the 3-D effects.  Recommended if you want check out what 3-D is like these days, but never mind the rest.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer</p></body></html>

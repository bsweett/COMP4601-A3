You see, I tremble with fear whenever I see a newer film and it has 500-800 reviews already. EAGLE EYE is so low, I wonder how many people actually saw it.<br /><br />Well, I suspect you know the drill on this one, so my personal observation-critique will be the standard for this one.<br /><br />I think Shia is very sexy in this film, and he had a bit of that just beginning in the original TRANSFORMERS. Here, I thought it was a massive stroke of genius to make him a twin whose over-achieving military officer brother has died. It is this brother that is the major key in the film, and me likey! It means more imagination, less BS. (You'll notice AVATAR stole this concept of twins.)<br /><br />The creepy extortionist who's really a computer gone mad...well I certainly didn't see that one coming, in spite of the fact that when it did come, it was a total rip-off of I, ROBOT. That wasn't too bad, considering the drama and suspense this film gives us. Shia's performance, though at times I think maybe a bit tepid, is intense. I love his eyes.<br /><br />That is where I am leaving it. My opinion is you need to see this film for yourself, as it seems so few people saw it. Shia deserves great support in his work right now, and I for one am giving it my all. I even suffered through DISTURBIA, one of the crappiest films ever made, because he's in it.</p></body></html>

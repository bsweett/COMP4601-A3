An American-ized remake is due out in 2010, probably due to the vampire-frenzy created by the awful Twilight Saga. The movie-world has been overpopulated with vampire movies lately, but this film serves as that little glimmer at the end of the tunnel; a film that uses the vampire mythology to tell it's story, without ruining the mythology. It's a film that tells a story quite similar to the one told in Twilight, except it's more poignant, more violent, and much more original.<br /><br />K?re Hedebrant plays Oskar, a 12-year-old boy with no friends; he's a strange kid, seen playing with knives and acting out violent situations, probably directed at the bullies he's frequently tormented by at school. Outside of his apartment building, Oskar meets a strange, 12-year-old girl named Eli (Lina Leandersson) who has recently moved into the building with an even stranger man (Per Ragnar). It's no spoiler to tell you that Eli is a vampire.<br /><br />This is not a "vampire" film in the traditional sense of the word, however. The film is much more interested in the relationship between Eli and Oskar, who begin to bond in a strange, initially disconnected way. It uses the idea that Eli is a vampire and Oskar is a human in the same way Twilight did, but the two characters are both 12-years-old. That's where Let the Right One In really succeeds. In this relationship, there's actually a poignant representation of a relationship between two pre-pubescent children, vampire aspects notwithstanding. Both are (technically) at an age where they haven't quite reached a level of sexual understanding, but there is a certain understanding of some sort. Their relationship is much more touching and poignant that the silly Twilight drivel.<br /><br />Both Hedebrant and Leandersson handle this material exceptionally well and, being the stars of the film, they're required to carry it...They do so quite admirably, especially when one takes into consideration that they're the same age as their characters.<br /><br />Looking beyond that, the story is just very well told if you have a little bit of patience. The story drew me in, although don't expect all your questions to be answered right away or, in some cases, at all. Despite the relationship angle, it's still very much a horror film that exercises much restraint on blood, gore, and special effects. There's a particularly chilling use of makeup in one scene, but other than a severed limb and some blood here-and-there it relies more on atmosphere (particularly it's gray, somber setting), poetic cinematography, and a haunting musical score.<br /><br />It's an eerie, effective film that is simultaneously haunting, violent, and beautiful. There are those who will find it slow and uninteresting, but it's really a quality piece of horror cinema. Anyone who has grown tired of the tired, clich&eacute;d "vampire-romance" movie will find this to be a welcoming breath of fresh air...It's an outstanding film, that truly deserves to be called "a work of art."<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></body></html>

But if we cut through that, we find that, in fact, this movie sucks.  Well, I admit that I only watched 2 of its 20 (I think) segments.  It's a loving tribute to 30s radio sci-fi serials and 50s sci-fi TV, but I see no reason to pay tribute to either of those formats, because they're full of bad writing, bad acting, and bad science.  As was this movie.  Life's too short.  Go watch THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.  This particular movie is strictly for stupid people.</p></body></html>

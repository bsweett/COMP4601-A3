<meta name="summary" content="The Cruelty of Nature!"></head><body><p>This penguin colony used to be near the water's edge but over time (apparently over thousands of years) the geography changed, the ice moved, and this colony wound up some 70 miles from the sea.  Rather than move as the ice moved, the penguin colony is hard wired to stay in their original spot and travel these 70 miles to the sea.  Why didn't they alter their behavior rather than take this long journey as part of their life's routine.  If it was to demonstrate their prowess, as a test to establish the survival of the best among them, then why were they at waters edge at their beginnings?<br /><br />These birds have no means of altering their facial muscles.  They are unable to give us a smile, or show fear, or sadness, or love, because they are just not built that way.  Any such emotions that were read into them by the movie's narrator are just that, something that was assumed in terms of human emotion.<br /><br />These are birds.  They most likely have strong emotions, but they should not be assumed to be the same emotions that humans have.  They have a different mate for each of their reproduction/nuturing cycles, and after they are able to find their own food, the young birds will never see their parents again.  This is not a human characteristic.  This is much closer to instinct, without involving deep emotion and sophisticated decision making.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie, with beautiful views of vast nothingness in the Antarctic, and Morgan Freeman was the right person to narrate the penguins' story.  But the penguins can't be assumed to have human characteristics.  If anything, looking at their blind following of signals from their genetic make-up, the anthropomorphic characteristic closest to their behavior is "stupidity."<br /><br />What this beautiful movie shows, more than anything else, is the cruelty of nature.  These poor creatures are condemned to what, in my human view, is a terribly hard and cruel life, throughout eternity.</p></body></html>

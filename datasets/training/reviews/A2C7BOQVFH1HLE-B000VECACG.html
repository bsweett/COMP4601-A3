<meta name="summary" content="Spielberg's Masterpiece!  Great DVD Too!"></head><body><p>The sign of a classic movie is how well it ages and "Close Encounters ..." seems to get better over the years and the more times you watch it.  This film has many signs to show that it was influenced by Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece "2001: A Space Odyssey" from the opening sequence to the massive role of music to the whole feel of the movie and yet Spielberg did not simply copy Kubrick's formula but instead took the genre on to another level putting his own stamp on it.  Franchises like The "X-Files" and many others have at least been influenced themselves by this film and the special effects are spectacular for the time given there was little if any CGI to the scale of today and yet the visual effects hold up very well even by today's standards.<br /><br />This one-disc Collector's Edition is also a real treat for fans as it has been restored very, very well for an excellent picture and sound quality.  I watched this in DTS surround and anamorphic video and the impact was fabulous!  I finally did justice to my system as it gave all my speakers a great workout.  I tried to find picture imperfections but in vain.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because there are no Special Features to speak of and for that you'll need to get the 2-Disc version.  For those who just want a great Director's Cut version of this film and are happy with just the one disc like myself, this is a very good dvd version to get.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

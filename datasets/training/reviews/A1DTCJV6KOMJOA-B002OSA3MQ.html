It takes place in the after shock of war of a torn a sunder Vienna. The streets full of shadows and cobble stones drenched in mist and puddles. Holly Martins (Cotten) is called to the city to attend his beloved friend Harry Lime's (Welles) funeral while he plans for his visit to be short he finds things aren't as they seem and Harry may not be dead and Martins also falls for Harry's lover played by Valdi. The camera angles are constantly changing giving the viewer a feeling of unbalance and unease. The acting is perfection Cotton is perfect as Harry Lime. The director Reed, wanted James Stewart but thank god Sleznick wanted Cotton. Stewart's everyman looks and drawl voice would have slowed the pace of the film greatly. Instead Cotten gives Martins a snide and swarmy appeal and in the end you never question why Cotten's Character befriended Welles' Lime. Because Martins'(Cotten) has a little of Lime's (Welles) persona in him. Valli is brilliant in her role as Anna Schmidt. She is both distant and lonely for her departed lover and will always love the man she thought Lime was instead of the monster that he is. Welles is brilliant! When we first see him in the building's foyer he smiles like only Wellels can. Like he knows something we never will it's not a smurk but a hint of evil lurks behind his eyes and cherub face. This film is mesmerizing!  Watch how Anna just goes through Lime's apartment knowing where everything is without even looking down to find what she is looking for-even though she just told the authorities she's never been there. Listen to how she constantly confuses the first names of Cotten's and Welles' similiarly named characters Holly and Harry! Little nuances like this makes films of this stature a gem to own. The final chase scenes through the vast and maze like sewers of Vienna is both daunting and claustrophobic to watch! And when welles slivers his hand through the grate your heart skips a beat. Simply the best thriller ever made!</p></body></html>

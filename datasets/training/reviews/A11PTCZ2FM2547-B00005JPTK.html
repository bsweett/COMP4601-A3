<meta name="summary" content="Extremely Haunting"></head><body><p>Director Francis Lawrence deserves a standing ovation for portraying such haunting images of a deserted Manhattan, its streets and thoroughfares overgrown with weeds and teaming with wild life.  A desolate Times Square long silenced into decay and deterioration has real impact on the viewer.  These images, combined with an exceptional performance by Will Smith, make I AM LEGEND a haunting, yet ultimately satisfying, experience.<br /><br />Smith, with the help of a German Shepherd, aptly carries this movie by himself.  I've seen this actor in numerous films, and in my opinion he's never been better.  The viewer shares Smith's range of emotions--from his determination to eradicate a deadly virus that has decimated the human population, to his fear and terror of the mutated zombies who survived the infection, to his grief over the loss of his family. . .to his utter loneliness and despair.  Intermingled with flashbacks depicting the once-promising virus (a cure for cancer) unleashed in New York, Lawrence and Smith convey a story that systematically builds tension and delivers suspense right to its tragic end.<br /><br />My biggest complaint (and it didn't take away from my enjoyment of this film) had to do with the cartoonish appearance of the zombies.  Bald, charcoal-colored, hairless, shirtless, these monsters with super-human strength and athleticism looked like they belonged in a video game, not a motion picture.  One can only wonder how much more real and convincing this story would have been had real actors been used. . .<br /><br />Regarding the special features of this two-disc set, the first disc includes four animated short features depicting other survivors coping with loneliness and/or despair in other parts of the world--and all four include some very disturbing images.  The second disc is another version of the entire film, featuring what is dubbed a "controversial ending."  Having viewed it, I am so glad the theatrical release ended the way it did, as the alternate ending was over the top--way too much of a "feel good" ending, and not in keeping with the post-apocalyptic theme of the story.  And for a plethora of extra features and segments the viewer is advised to insert Disc #2 into his/her PC and go online--something that is above and beyond the call of duty of at least this couch potato.  Setting these drawbacks aside, I AM LEGEND is recommended viewing, a haunting story of loneliness, tension, and heart-pounding suspense.<br />--D. Mikels, Author The Reckoning</p></body></html>

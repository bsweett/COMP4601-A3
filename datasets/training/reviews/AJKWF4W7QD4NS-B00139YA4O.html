<meta name="summary" content="Get Lost"></head><body><p>From Alias creator J. J. Abrams, the landmark first season of Lost became a critical success and a ratings juggernaut for ABC.  Beginning with a mysterious plane crash, a large group of survivors find themselves stranded on a seemingly deserted island.  As the season unfolds, each character is given a flashback-style glimpse into their past and the events that lead them to boarding the plane, while they each learn that there is something lurking on the island; something strange, and very deadly.  All this leads the survivors to discover that they are not the only ones on the island, and the season ending discovery of a strange metal hatch and what lurks inside will leave you salivating for season two.  Lost's large cast, including Matthew Fox as the resident doctor Jack, Lord of the Rings' Dominic Monaghan as heroin raddled fallen rock star Charlie, newcomer Evangeline Lily as the mysterious Kate, Milennium's Terry O'Quinn as survivalist John, and Oz's Harold Perrineau who is here along with his young, disobedient son.  The rest of the cast, including Daniel Dae Kim, Ian Somerhalder, Naveen Andrews, and Jorge Garcia among others, do great work, and by the end of this season, one of them will be dead, and there will be more questions than answers.  The storytelling is sharp (including David Fury as a staff writer, who wrote and directed some of the best episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel), and with the unique aspect of the show, it's no secret why Lost has become such a runaway hit.  As a previous reviewer stated, superb shows of the last few years such as the X-Files, Buffy, Angel, and Farscape didn't achieve true perfection until their second season, and if Lost manages to fall into the same category, then it's time to prepare for something really special, and now has never been a better time to get Lost.</p></body></html>

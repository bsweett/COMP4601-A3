<meta name="summary" content="A Graceful Fantasy Interlude"></head><body><p>We watched this movie and found it to be smoothly paced and entertaining. We are both fans of Paul Giamatti, who plays the part of Cleveland Heep, and have his John Adams series on DVD and found his performance in this movie as one of the movie's high points.<br /><br />This is a simple fantasy movie and if you can accept that there is a good chance you can enjoy it too. The part of the "Lady" who is in the water is played by Bryce Dallas Howard with an innocent simplicity which is touching. Here is a vulnerable creature which needs protection and Heep discovers that job has fallen to him.<br /><br />The movie is consistent in carrying the innocent, fantasy theme all the way to the end. I recommend the movie for families.</p></body></html>

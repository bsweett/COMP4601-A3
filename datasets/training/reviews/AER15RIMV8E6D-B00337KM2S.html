George Clooney stars as Ryan Bingham, a man who goes around in a plane, firing people. He is forced to team up with a young coworker named Natalie Keener who is pushing a plan to cut costs by having employees stay grounded and fire people over the internet. That's basically it. I'd probably recommend that you go UP IN THE AIR!!!</p></body></html>

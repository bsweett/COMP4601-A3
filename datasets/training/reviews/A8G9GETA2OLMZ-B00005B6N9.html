<meta name="summary" content="Laughably Bad"></head><body><p>This may be the worst movie I have sat all the way through.<br /><br />I kept thinking (or hoping) not that it would get better but that it would get less bad.<br /><br />It didn't.  It just went from bad to worse.<br /><br />This is chiefly because of bad writing throughout, lame special effects, and bad--spectacularly bad--acting on the part of the two principal white males.<br /><br />Cole Hauser, who plays Vin Diesel's Probation Officer, learned acting in modeling school: to act, strike poses.  He overacts, or I should say overposes, shamelessly.<br /><br />Vin Diesel has the opposite technique.  He apparently filmed this while in a coma.  Either that or he phoned it in, and his body was produced by special effects.<br /><br />The women aren't bad, but nothing can redeem this hopeless clunker.<br /><br />Even the creatures aren't very frightening.  And the more you see them, the less frightening they get.  All of $1.75 was spent on their computer animation.<br /><br />And at least that much was spent on red-syrup for blood.  There is also a lot of blue-syrup for blood.  This is either the creatures' blood, or simply some arty filming.<br /><br />Also in the Arty Filming Dept. is the overall YELLOW of the first scenes.  Later this is dropped, with no explanation.  Also dropped is the notion that the survivors have to use breathing apparatus.  I guess they got tired of sucking on tubes.  These simply disappear.<br /><br />They aren't the only ones that suck.  Marvelously sucky are the stabs at Portentous Dialogue.  Seeing Vin Diesel debate (or somnabulate) theology with the Muslim guy is truly amusing.  (But don't eat your lunch first.)<br /><br />What redeems this whole mess is the fact that YOU DON'T CARE A DAMN ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. When they die, or when they escape, you don't care.<br /><br />A silly comedy.  The songs are especially unmemorable.</p></body></html>

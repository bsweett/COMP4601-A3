I say B"></head><body><p>IRON LADY - Starring Meryl Streep & Jim Broadbent - Rated PG-13<br /><br />"Watch your character, for it becomes your destiny. What we think we become." A look at the life of Margaret Thatcher, the first and only female Prime Minister of England. This movie covers from her acceptance to Oxford up to present day. Being a huge history buff I was looking forward to this movie. Growing up in the 80's I remember quite a bit about Thatcher and was hoping to see stuff that I knew already and events to help me fill in the gaps of things I didn't. While this is a good movie overall I was very disappointed. The movie pretty much deals with how she handles her husbands death with bits of flashbacks thrown in. It does cover a fair amount of her time as leader but really only covers how she decided to run, trying to get back the Faulking Islands and her resignation. I was surprised there wasn't more Cold War events as well as her dealings with Reagan. I will admit that Meryl Streep was amazing in this movie and did deserve the Oscar, but I am glad the movie wasn't up for best picture. Even for a history buff like me this was a little boring. Overall, a good movie but I was hoping for more events of when she was Prime Minister. I give it a B.</p></body></html>

The truth is, it doesn't. I did prefer the somewhat subtler delivery of the Swedish film, but on the whole LET ME IN managed to retain much of the eeriness of it's predecessor, and Chloe Moretz, Kodi-Smit McPhee, and Elias Koteas were superb. Either film is far beyond some of the more recent editions to the genre, with none of the cloying after-taste.</p></body></html>

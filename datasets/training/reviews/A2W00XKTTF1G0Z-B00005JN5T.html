<meta name="summary" content="Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Striesand Rule!"></head><body><p>I was skeptical about this picture until I saw it.<br /><br />Seeing Dustin Hoffman and Barabara Strisand on screen was the funniest couple I have seen since Richard Dryfuss and Marcia Mason in The Goodbye Girl. The chemistry that they have is amazing. They were onbviously having fun and it came off natural. Barbara Striesand as a SEX therapists! Who would of thought?<br /><br />The two seemed a natural couple and obviously were having a great deal of fun together. The movie is magic when they get on screen.<br /><br />If you were fans of the original movie you love this even more. In contrast to Robert Dinero and Blyth Danner's characters this film is a funny roller coaster fromt he moment Dustin and Barbara hit the screen. The contracst of the two familties is hysterically real.<br /><br />Bed Stiller is really the audiences persepctive in this movie. The story is simple - in-laws meet in-laws. The fun begins when Dustin enters the room with Barbara right behind him!<br /><br />I would reccomend this film to those who need a light fluffy fun picture. I applaud Dustin for doing this film and I applaud Barbara for letting her hair down, out and all over!<br /><br />I didn't care for the first one too much..but Iloved this one!<br /><br />You go Dustin and Barbara!  1-05</p></body></html>

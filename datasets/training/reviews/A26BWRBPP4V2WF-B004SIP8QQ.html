To recap - The Bride has polished off Vernita Green and Oh-ren Ishi (and her bodyguards) in what was essentially a wall-to-wall action fest of Kung-fu and swordplay.  Having done in two of the group that massacred her bridal party, The Bride sets her sites on the remaining three perpetrators - Elle, Bud, and the boss of the group, Bill.<br /><br />Anyone who has seen the ads of the film know that Elle and The Bride have their battle in a mobile home in the desert.  In fact, most of the action of the film takes place in and around this trailer, as it happens to be owned by Bud, who also meets his fate there.  The Elle/Bride battle is, in fact, the only large-scale fight scene in the film.  The pace is much slower with significantly more dialogue than Vol. 1. This is to my liking - Tarantino shines his brightest when his characters are serving up their versions of philosophy.  Especially brilliant is Bill's exposition on the difference between Spider-man and Superman, as pertains to their secret identities.<br /><br />Much is answered in this film - how Elle lost her eye, how the Bride became such an efficient killing machine (and why she fled Bill's group), and we even learn the Bride's real name.  Other things are never explained - why everyone hates Bill so much, for example.  There are few surprises - the audience is likely to be ahead of the plot.  However, such is Tarantino's editing technique and dialogue pacing that the plot is never important - it's not about what happens so much as how it happens.  And there are a couple genuine surprises that are all the more effective after thinking you have everything figured out.<br /><br />This is a fine movie, and a worthy second part (not sequel) to the first.  Although my favourite individual scene (the escape from the hospital) is in Vol. 1, there is more in Vol. 2 that is memorable, because it's more dialogue driven.  I wonder if Tarantino plans to recut the films and mix up the scenes in some future special edition version?<br /><br />On that note, I will repeat the warnings of some others - don't bother buying this DVD.  Mirimax is notorious for their crappy first-release DVD's, and both Vol. 1 and 2 have no worthwhile extras (although a cut scene of a fight between Bill and an unidentified assailant is mildly interesting).  Since the films work as a whole, wait until the special edition set comes out.  I'm sure it'll be worth the wait.</p></body></html>

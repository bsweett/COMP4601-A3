<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Movie Hiden In A Sea Of Retarded Movies"></head><body><p>David Cronenberg has a way of making sure that we take a look at distrubing images and truly understand them.  Eastern Promises has plenty of those, from a Russian mobster's throat being sawed open by a feeble-minded teenager to Viggo Mortensen's impromptu nudity in a harrowing bath-house scuffle.  Ballsy.  Literally.  What Eastern Promises deals in is humanity and how it is a senseless, jolting dance at times and a ballet at others.  Girls ransported from Russia to London are kept as prostitutes and slaves by the Russian Mob, drugged up, left for dead when they escape.  One of the unfortunate girls turns up pregnant and bleeding in a London drugstore.  She dies during childbirth, leaving behind a beautiful baby girl and a diary of her tormented life.  The novel is written in Russian.  Midwife Anna (Naomi Watts) tries to have her Russian uncle decipher the book, but when he gives her a warning to have the book buried with the dead girl, she go elswhere for trasnlation.  Right to the man responsible for the girl's horrific torment.  Nikolai (Mortensen) is the driver and confidant to the a Russian mafioso's drunken, careless son with clear aspirations of rising within the crime family to a more respectable position.  Anna's appearance shakes his allegiance and his ability to continue doing unspeakble things in the name of honor and tattooed code.<br /><br />This is a great movie with a great twist at the end that you wouldn't have expected at all, unless you follow the subtle clues carefully.  Filled with suspense and brutality as only Cronenberg can show us, this film comes very close to eclipsing such crime dramas as The Godfather or Goodfellas in its blunt clarity.  In the sea of tripe that is floating out there, it is refreshing to see a movie that is not filled with Hollywood cliches and product placement techniques.<br /><br />Dig it!</p></body></html>

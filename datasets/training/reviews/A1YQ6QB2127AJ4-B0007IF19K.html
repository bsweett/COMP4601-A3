<meta name="summary" content="The One And Only Ray Charles"></head><body><p>"Ray", released in 2004, garnered much critical acclaim from the critics.  The quality of this film proves them all as well-deserved, earning seven Oscar nomination including Best Picture and winning two (Best Sound Mixing and Best Actor).  It stars Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Clifton Powell, and others.  This film portrays the life and times of legendary musician Ray Charles.  It shows how he changed music history through his songs, his piano, and his vocals.  Through a grueling work schedule, heroin addiction, multiple sex partners, racism, and blindness, he overcomes every life obsticle wonderfully.  Meanwhile, it portrays his struggling childhood.  These past images haunt him through the whole film, namely his brother's early death.  All of the shown glimpses show how he began his life journey where the film begins.<br /><br />These scenes and events are written beautifully.  Between the two simultaneous timelines, the film flows smoothly.  It successfully distinguishes his music often played in whole and his personal life without any major distractions.  Therefore, this is not just a musician "biopic".  It's a drama.  Few other films have accomplished this difficult task to this magnitude ("Amedeus", 1984).  This film gives Ray Charles the recognition he deserves as a musician and a person.  Led by director Taylor Hackford, the series of events remain entertaining, yet heartfelt in certain scenes.  Such quality proves that the fifteen years of struggling to create this film was worth the wait.  The emotional stance continually builds, leading to a powerful conclusion.<br /><br />Words cannot describe Jamie Foxx's performance as Ray Charles.  His mannerisms and appearance resemble exactly Charles's, ranging the performances style to the reaction of excitement to the speaking tone to the heroin reaction.  Therefore, watching Foxx is just like watching Ray Charles.  This difficult task proved well researched since he never leaves his "Ray Charles mode".  Occassionally does a film feature an actor portraying a real-life figure maintain their preciseness.  Though the actual Charles sings in the film, he expresses his own musical passion through the film.  The crew couldn't have hired a better actor for this role.  This truly was the performance of 2004 and of his career.  His hard work before and during filming paid off.<br /><br />Though Foxx's performance is the main showcase, the other actors also portray their roles beautifully.  Through drug addiction, heartbreak, financial struggle, and betrayal, the actors' talents take this film to further emotional stance.  Some supporting roles could have received an Oscar nomination without complaints from the critics, namely Kerry Washington and Regina King.<br /><br />The costume design and the make-up are accurate to the mid-1900's styles.  Jamie Foxx's appearance amazingly resembles Ray Charles to the degree that viewers often difficulty distinguishing the two.  Many characters, especially the women, could be mistaken as actual 1950's footage because of the make-up, the wardrobes, and the hairstyles.  The costumes also resemble Charles's actual suits worn on stage.<br /><br />Such overall film quality makes "Ray" unforgettable viewing experience.  The DVD is a great essential for any Ray Charles or Jamie Foxx fans as it will surely please its audiences for a long time.  Other material that film fans may like are Ray Charles's final album "Genius Loves Company" and the "Ray" Sountrack.</p></body></html>

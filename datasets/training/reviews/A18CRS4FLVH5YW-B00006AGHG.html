There is something to be said, however, if you use too much you've spoiled the dish.  This movie exceeds the extremeties at times and makes for a film that will either grab you or send you to the grocery store to look for the newest version of &quot;movie repellent!&quot;  Each scene is carefully structured here and the director of this film certainly knows how to create mood and tension between characters.  What's sad is there is simply too much of these colors swirled in the mix and it tries too hard to envelop the audience.  Sam Jackson portrays (quite brilliantly) a guy who is hit in the face from all sides, making revenge his only mainstay for survival.  Ben Affleck is the top star lawyer who isn't having too good of day either but in reality you know this scenario simply wouldn't and couldn't rightfully happen.  Knowing well that this is a movie, I can buy the idea of watching something a little over the top.  I can handle that and I am sure audiences can handle that but there is a limit to what a movie should do to be a REALLY effective thriller.  This movie unfortunately exceeds on too many levels and goes overboard with too many dramatics and too many things that simply would not happen in real life.  It simply does not suspend disbelief long enough for a person to come down and think about what is really going on here.  One thing really going for this movie, however, is it's superb work as a brilliant character study of survival of the fittest.  I still think this movie should have had a much more sinister and darker ending to rightfully match what we were seeing throughout the film.</p></body></html>

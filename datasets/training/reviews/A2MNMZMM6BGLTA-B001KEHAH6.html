<meta name="summary" content="Not very good"></head><body><p>I didn't think this movie was very good. It was a light comedy and had a few chuckles but mostly it was just nothing special. Jennifer Garner stars with her freaky strange face as a little girl that wants to be an adult and thru the miracle of magic dust gets her wish. So its then the movie Big without Tom Hanks regurgitated for a girl but not as funny or origional. Jennifer Garner is just not a good actress. She isn't horrible but she is just not that good. I would recommend this movie to girls and women who seem to like this kind of fluff.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Yuri is amoral ,  not immoral, when it comes to his career."></head><body><p>Immorality suggest he (Cage) has a conscience, however bad, about what he is doing: selling death to anyone with $$$. His brother & partner Vitaly (Jared Leto) has a conscience & it destroys him. Yuri has a beautiful, trophy wife Ava (Bridget Moynahan) a family, & lavish life style. Ava was either stupid or in denial about how he made his money. She never questions it until near the end. It is the only thing he is good at. He has no politics but does have the stones to stand toe to toe with the most disgusting, murderous dictators in the world. They pillage their treasuries to buy the latest weapons he has to offer. This is a black comedy & Cage injects humor as he narrates the story of his whole life in a rather dead-pan, casual way. Yuri is finally busted by an agent of Interpol, who has been collecting evidence on him for years. Yuri is  immediately released because of his connections to the biggest (by far) arms dealer in the world. Guess who? You're right. Actually, a pretty good anti-war movie.</p></body></html>

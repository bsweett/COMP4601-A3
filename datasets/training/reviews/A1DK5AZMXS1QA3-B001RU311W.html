<meta name="summary" content="Another great character role for Sean Penn"></head><body><p>Every decade, Hollywood has an actor that takes the tough roles and turns them into great movies.  For the past 10 years, this would probably be Sean Penn.  With classics such as 21 Grams, Mystic River, and now Milk, Sean Penn has progressed far from his bad boy days and is now one of the best American actors.  Milk is Penn's portrayal of the political career of Harvey Milk, one of the first openly gay men elected to public office in the USA.  Starting in NYC and ending in the Bay Area around San Francisco, this movie shows how the closeted gay Mr. Milk became openly gay, and then a gay rights crusader who took on big political honchos in California and the US national scene.  All the major characters from Milk's later life are included in this movie, though the movie does not mention anything about his family.  I would normally give this movie 5/5 stars, but the inclusion of numerous gay love scenes was quite gross, and quite have been easily excluded without taking away for the movie.  Hence the 4/5 stars instead.  But overall, a good portrayal of how local politics works, the gay rights movement, and good commentary on American society in general.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Robocop (1987)"></head><body><p>This ultra-violent, totally awesome satirical cop-actioner (which was originally given an "X" rating by the MPAA, prior to the conception of the "NC-17" sticker) is arguably one of Paul Verhoeven's best films, besting pictures such as his other sci-fi greats Total Recall and Starship Troopers, and his erotic thriller Basic Instinct. Its smart script is a sardonic and bloody one that surveys topical subject matter like the human character and America's cultural obsession with media and its lasting effects. All the while, however, screenwriters Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner appease the blood- and action-lusting appetite of that same obsessive American culture, while Verhoeven does what he's best at: delivering his renowned action-focused pace to movies of the action and science-fiction genres, making them as entertaining as they are usually gory.</p></body></html>

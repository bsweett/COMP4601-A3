Never one of my favorites, I always felt Nicholson just kept playing the same roles over and over.  But in his awesome performance in A FEW GOOD MEN, I finally saw what the critics and Oscar voters had already seen:  the man is an incredibly gifted actor.  In AS GOOD AS IT GETS, for which he won a Best Actor award, Nicholson parlays all of his usual tics and gestures into a superb portrait of an obsessive-compulsive man afraid of living life, and most definitely afraid of becoming involved with other people.  He is overtly nasty and one would never believe there was a real human being underneath all that venom.  However, once he "babysits" his neighbors precious pooch, we see a side of Melvin that lets us know there IS a real person beneat that cynically oppressive facade.  It's to Nicholson's credit that as he goes through the movie making mistake after mistake, we really hope he gets the girl in the end.  Helen Hunt in her Oscar winning performance is marvelous; she exudes an everyday commonality and a warmth rare in many of our actresses today.  While it's hard to believe she and Nicholson would ever hook up, Hunt's performance is so astutely controlled, we forget she's acting.  And Greg Kinnear (so good in Nurse Betty) is a revelation as the homosexual neighbor, Simon.  While not totally eschewing the stereotypical effeminance of homsexuality, Kinner displays a leading man swagger with the vulnerability of a lifestyle that can be challenging to say the least.  Kinnear was nominated for a supporting actor award, and he is definitely worthy of that nomination in this superbly nuanced performance.  Ditto to the marvelous Shirley Knight who plays Hunt's mother; while not on screen a great deal, Knight's relationship with her daughter is heartwarming and convincing.  Even Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr. redeems himself for Snow Dogs in a showy role as Kinnear's friend.  Director James L. Brooks shows a keen sense of knowing how to get the best from his actors, and AS GOOD AS IT GETS is a wonderful film to be enjoyed by all those who have been in love and didn't know it!</p></body></html>

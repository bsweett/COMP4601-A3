<meta name="summary" content="A haunting and memorable film"></head><body><p>Christopher McCandless, a recent Emory graduate and the son of wealthy parents, decides to give up his money, his identity, and his family and live on his own.  He travels across the country, and eludes the best efforts of his parents to locate him.  His sister, lonely without her best support in the family, narrates her feelings about him throughout the movie.  Chris considers his parents to be hypocritical liars and his journey is partly motivated by anger towards them and partly by his own adventuresome spirit.  Along the way he comes across kindly people who give him a job, a place to stay, or a listening ear.  One of those he comes across is an old man, played wonderfully by Hal Holbrook, who has given up on life and relationships.<br /><br />Chris's ultimate objective is to live in the wild in Alaska, and much of the film is devoted to his time there.  The scenery is beautiful, but the struggle is brutal.  This movie has many layers and will springboard many discussions among those who have see it.</p></body></html>

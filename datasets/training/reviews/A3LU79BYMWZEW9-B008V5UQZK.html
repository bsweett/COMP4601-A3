I mean, where else are  you going to get an oddball double bill like "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" and "XXX"?  You gotta love that!  Well, actually, I didn't quite love "XXX"--just not my cup of tea, although it may be, as they say, "good of kind."  "Greek Wedding," however, was another story, a real charmer through and through--an ugly duckling story in which the swan never totally abandons her duckling roots.  (Bad metaphor, but you know what I mean).<p>There really isn't much that is startlingly new in this heartwarmer.  Culture clash has always been a standard comedic ploy for as long as this nation has been a melting pot, and mixed marriages have been making for mixed up comedies since well before "I Love Lucy."  But a proven formula doesn't necessarily guarantee success.  Without sharp writing, good comic acting, and expert direction things can still go terribly awry.  Luckily for us, "Greek Wedding" is pretty much three for three on all those counts.  <p>Based on a one-woman live show written and performed by comic actress Nia Vardalos and brought to the big screen with the help of Hollywood power couple, Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, "Greek Wedding" retains much of its non-splashy modest roots but is also very successfully "opened up".  Vardalos is a wonderful actress, but she and director Joel Zwick have also a assembled a colorful cast of well-known and not so well-known actors who flesh out what must have been somewhat sketchier portraits in the theater piece.<p>It's always heartening to see good actors get a chance to do good work.  When was the last time you even saw Michael Constantine or Lainie Kazan in ANYTHING, let alone anything GOOD!? Another reviewer below wondered why John Corbett isn't a bigger star.  I can't say whether he'd be a great regular leading man or not.  He's always had something of a Jeff Bridges quality, to be sure, but it's a quirky kind of Jeff Bridges-ness. He's just about perfect here though.  Here's hoping that he and the rest of this ensemble cast find more such quality projects--and if Nia Vardalos pens them, well, you can pretty much rest assured it'll be quality stuff.</p></body></html>

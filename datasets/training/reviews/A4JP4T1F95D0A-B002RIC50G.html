It is certainly no Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon, but it was interesting.  The movie is very dark.  Most of the characters have very dark sides.  Though I do have to say that everyone has a reason for their actions which makes it more realistic.  Hopkins is sorely missed, but even the best makeup can't make him 40 years younger to play himself in his early 20's.  The young actor playing young Hannibal is solid and certainly creepy, he also came across a bit flat.  The story is interesting on how Hannibal became the monster he is.  I think the aunt part is not really necessary and muddles things somewhat.  Overall I think this is worth watching if you are a fan of Hannibal, but on its' own it is merely so so.</p></body></html>

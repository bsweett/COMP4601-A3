<meta name="summary" content="Great adventure flick!"></head><body><p>Saw this one in Baltimore's beautiful and historic Senator Theater. It is a high-action adventure flick, like the other Indy movies. Indy might be getting older but he can still whoop arse. This time, Indy is going after a crystal skull that can pass information psychically to others (through their minds). The Russians want the skull and the FBI is snooping around too. The movie begins with a caravan of military vehicles across the desert. And that's about all I can tell you, without telling you too much, except that Karen Allen returns from the 1st Indy movie, where she was Indy's adventure girl against the Nazi's for the Arc of the Covenant. Cate Blanchette is the Russian "bad guy" in the flick. (She plays one of those smart arses that you wanna slap.) Excellent flick and a fast 2 hours. It's probably ok for most kids about age 7 and up?. (There are some skeletons and a few people get toasted with flames and shot, so, use your judgement.) I loved it and would see it again in a heartbeat (even though I thought the end was a little squirrelly)!  It's the same type adventure as the other 2 Indy movies.<br /><br />If you want to find out more about crystal skulls, you might enjoy reading "The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls: Unlocking the Secrets of the Past, Present, and Future" by Chris Morton. This book contains a whole lot of Mayan cultural and historical information.</p></body></html>

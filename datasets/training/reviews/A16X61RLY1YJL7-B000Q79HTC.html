<meta name="summary" content="The Bourne Identity - A heart pounding spy thriller!"></head><body><p>Starring Matt Damon and Franka Potente, a beautiful German actress, The Bourne Identity is a huge success.  Fraught with intense action scenes and rich character development, this movie resounds with the passion of a high speed thriller that will bear many viewings.  I must admit to some trepidation about Matt Damon in an action role given his past roles, this trepidation doesn't bear out though, as he performs admirably in the role of a CIA assassin who has lost his memory.<p>The premise:<p>Jason Bourne is a CIA assassin who is found floating in the Mediterranean Sea by a fishing boat.  He has two bullets in his back, an odd little laser device with a Zurich address and no memory as to who he is.  After two weeks on the fishing boat, he heads for Zurich and the search to who he really is.  Once he starts on this quest, he finds that he has some absolutely amazing skills and is almost immediately defending himself from being killed in several different ways.  He is then fortunate enough to find Marie, who he pays to drive him to Paris.  The quickly developed relationship between these two characters is quite beautifully filmed.<p>What ensues is clearly one of the best spy/action thrillers to come out in some time.  This films action sequences will leave you exhausted and the plot line will enthrall you completely.  If this is your type of genre, I highly recommend this film.<p>The Special features are also quite interesting; of note are the alternate ending and the "Making of" clips.  {ssintrepid}</p></body></html>

Everyone's romantic situation is under stress; how those situations are worked out is the engaging, funny theme of this holiday movie.<br /><br />Some subplots are fairly obvious: a single Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) who falls for his attractive young caterer; a widower (Liam Neeson) helping his young stepson through his first big crush; a writer (Colin Firth) fleeing a failed relationship who falls for his Portuguese maid; and a middle-aged wife (Emma Thompson) who suspects her husband is cheating.  Other subplots are more subtle: a young man's affection for his best friend's new bride; two porn actors exploring a real relationship; an office worker in love with a co-worker; an aging rocker facing a lonely Christmas; and a sex-crazed youth seeking an American female.<br /><br />Managing this many storylines becomes a point of dramatic tension.  Director Richard Curtis keeps the action moving, sliding us past a few gimmicks while lingering in the right places.  The result is heartwarming, humorous, suprisingly honest, and sometimes absurd. The story is well-seeded with distinctly British humor and surprise cameos.  "Love Actually" is very highly recommended as worthwhile romantic comedy.</p></body></html>

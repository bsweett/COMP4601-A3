<meta name="summary" content="Dead Silence.........Old Fashioned Horror at its' heart!........"></head><body><p>Originally titled "The Doll and Mary Shaw", Dead Silence is a 2007 horror film about a ventriloquist named Mary Shaw who was murdered after a young boy heckles her & comes up missing. She takes her vengeance on the town through her dolls. Directed by James Wan & Written by Leigh Whannell(Creators of Saw); it stars Donnie Wahlberg(yes, of 'New Kids on the Block' fame), Ryan Kwantan, Amber Valletta & Judith Roberts.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Dead Silence didn't do too well at the box-office making around $16.5 Million domestically at the time of its' release in theaters. DVD sales has upped that amount to over $20,861,015 Worldwide. It took an estimated $20 Million to make the film. There are rumors of a sequel being made in the near future but the chances of it seem unlikely. We'll have to wait and see... ;)<br /><br />In my opinion, Dead Silence is a great Horror movie. Definitely one of my favorites. One that I hope will see a sequel. It's a good choice for a 'Friday Night Fright'.</p></body></html>

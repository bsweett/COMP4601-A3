I remember seeing a copy of Cinefex magazine, dealing with the production of the film. There was a ton of imagination and special effects that went into the making of "The Thing".<br /><br />What makes "The Thing" so creepy is the nature of the "Alien" menace. A creature that attacks and "takes over" it's intended victim at a cellular level, in essence becoming an exact copy of it's victim! What is perhaps it's most disgusting and surprising trait, is when it is either surprised or found out (identified). The laws of nature are thrown out the window, and you are witness to some of the most shocking mutations to ever come from a sick and depraved mind. To this, Carpenter puts into the mix a group of men who have undergone extensive psychological testing, just to be able to work in an isolated environment (no one wants these men going koo-koo a couple of months into their stay).<br />Well, let's just say that it wasn't enough. Once the menace is identified, little by little, these men come apart at the seams! It's every man for himself (itself?)!<br /><br />"The Thing" is LOOOOONG on suspense! At times, it's well, nigh unbearable. This is John Carpenter's best film. Rob Bottin's special effects deserved an Oscar. Kurt Russell was just coming out of his "sqeaky clean" teenage image that followed him from his early films.<br />There is one thing I find curious. On some copies of this film, a Stevie Wonder song is being played in the kitchen scene, and on others, it's different music. Also, there are copies with narration! Perhaps it was added when the film went to cable. This film, like Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho", are must-see (if not must-own) films for the horror fanster!</p></body></html>

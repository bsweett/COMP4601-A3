<meta name="summary" content="One of the funniest comdies I have seen"></head><body><p>This is by the director of Dude, Where's My Car,Danny Leiner. It stars Danny Cho and Kal Penn. It is about Two stoners that suddenly get the munchies after smoking and They decide to go to White Castle, but they ecounter weird situations on the way. They run into a Jesus freak(uh,in a literal sense), they run in to Neil Patrick Harris, and he steals their car. They run into Harold's ex-girlfriend and they wind up in the bathroom with two soroity girls that plan to have sex with them but they play Battle Crap(it is the s-word). So They finally get to the White Castle after a long and weird night. They have a feast fit for kings.<br /><br />This movie is,in a weird sense, brillant. The actors Kal Penn and John Cho make you laugh and carry the entire film on their hands. The guest spots were entirely wasted, the only funny ones was Neil Patrick Harris and Jamie Kennedy. This movie isn't for everyone, it could offend, or gross out, or bother some people. I found it hilarously wonderful. Danny Leiner isn't the greatest director of all time but he shows some funny comedy chops and has a future. I also liked how lot of the jokes worked and they clicked like in some other asnine comedies.</p></body></html>

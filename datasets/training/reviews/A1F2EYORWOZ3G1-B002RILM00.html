<meta name="summary" content="Short of the mark, but still decent."></head><body><p>This movie does miss the mark. Not only did they move the scenes to america, they changed the main evil characters sex and a few other liberties were taken.<br /><br />But the underlying plot is still a good one.<br /><br />Asked to investigate a missing child, a detective goes on his own to try and solve the case only to ultimately find out he is to become a human sacrifice.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is Nicholas Cage's acting is over the edge. There is a great gap in the other's acting and his. The sense of brooding and paranoia doesn't come through. And there's no growing feeling of doom either. It's as though the characters are just interpreting lines to their own liking instead of playing the movie out together... as a team.<br /><br />The Wicker Man is a wonderful mystery. However, I heartfully recommend the original way above this one. It plays on your fears, developes the senses of urgency, deadly secrets and dread.</p></body></html>

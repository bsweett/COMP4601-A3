<meta name="summary" content="ENGROSSING CHARACTER STUDY"></head><body><p>The Zodiac killings are a risk to film because we never really find out the identity of the killer.  This well-done version gives us a strong possibility even though there is no closure.<br />Director David Fincher leads a very good cast through a two and a half hour movie that ultimately results in a strong character study focusing on obsession and opportunism.  Mark Ruffalo, Jake Gylenhaal and Robert Downey stand out in the stellar cast with good support from Anthony Andrews, John Carroll Lynch, Chloe Sevigny and Dermot Mulroney.  It takes a lot of patience to stick with its pacing, but actually the pacing helps build the terror and paranoia that accompanied the Zodiac's heinous crimes.</p></body></html>

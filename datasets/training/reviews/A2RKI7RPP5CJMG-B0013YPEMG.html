It's a good movie that shows you just how twisted and complex &quot;Batman&quot; really is.  He's not played out as some good guy without a care in the world, he's portrayed as a  vengeful, scared and somewhat chemically-imbalanced human being who just happens to be loaded and has a collection of &quot;wonderful toys.&quot;  In other words, Keaton plays the &quot;Dark Knight&quot; as human as a guy in a batsuit can be.  Although everyone talks about Nicholson, Keaton is the real treat here because he pulls off a character that no one really thought he could portray.  <p>Don't get me wrong, Nicholson is wickedly funny as our favorite villain, &quot;Joker.&quot;  He's a total jerk with a screw loose(not unlike our hero) who's hellbent on making everyone &quot;happy.&quot;  He is the glue that keeps this story together.  He's also the reason most folks who don't read comics went to the theater to check this movie out.<p>The special effects are excellent for the time period, and the supporting cast is good as well.  Kim Basinger is nice to look at, but she is probably the least convincing character in this film.  As other reviewers stated, the story is a little uneven, but it's made up for with the brilliant belltower climax.<p>In closing, &quot;Batman&quot; is what all superhero flicks should be:  1) True to the original concept of the characters(Manipulating 'Penguin' in the second flick was immoral) 2) Has an interesting storyline(unlike every sequel) 3) Good special effects that don't come off too cheesy(ref. every sequel) 4) A real cast that's actually interested in the story(no George Clooney) 5) And completely void of multiple arch-villains(Why did every movie after this one include two baddies versus &quot;Batman&quot; anyway?) <p>Enjoy this flick, and if you like it, you'll probably enjoy &quot;Daredevil&quot; and the &quot;Blade&quot; flicks as well.  They are just as dark and brooding.</p></body></html>

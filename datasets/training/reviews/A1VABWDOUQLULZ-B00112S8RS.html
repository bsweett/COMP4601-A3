The situation was relatable, the acting superb, the direction clear albeit nonlinear.  The story was thought-provoking if not eerily recursive.  However, once the secret is out the momentum dropped drastically.  I found that I didn't care what the true outcome would be, which is a weakness for an otherwise strong setup.</p></body></html>

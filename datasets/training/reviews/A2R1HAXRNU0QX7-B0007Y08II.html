<meta name="summary" content="FUNNIEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!"></head><body><p>TEAM AMERICA is the foulest, dirtiest, most rude and obnoxious and ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS movie I have ever seen.  The great thing about the film is that it is absolutely heedless of who it offends or takes shots at.  And believe me, it has something offensive for everyone.<br /><br />In short, it details the misadventures of a group of anti-terrorist Americans, working out of a supersecret  homebase in the middle of Mt. Rushmore.  These gung-ho heroes hunt down terrorists wherever they find them.  In the opening sequence, the team descends on Paris to wipe out some terrorists with a WMD in a briefcase.  While they DO take out the terrorists, they also manage to destroy the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre and the Arch d Triumphe.  Certainly they do more damage to Paris than the bomb in the suitcase.  Later, they destroy the Pyramids and the Sphinx stopping another group of terrorists.  The point is obviously that these deeply right-wing nuts are alienating the world, blundering into situations without regard for consequences, etc. etc.  So, we think the movie is bashing the supposedly extremist Bush-administration.<br /><br />But then, when we learn the Kim Jong Il of North Korea has a huge plan for basically disrupting all of civilization (mostly so he gets a little attention), the tables turn - very pointedly making fun of all the celebrities and their peace-mongering.  Alec Baldwin, Tim Robbins, George Clooney and on and on are shown as knee-jerk liberals who can't even make a cogent case against Team America...except to say something about "big corporations."<br /><br />So the creators of the movie play fair...everyone is skewered.  Although I would have to say that in the end, the left wing is more soundly skewered, primarily because all the celebrities are dispatched in the most horrifically violent and amusing ways possible.<br /><br />Among other joys are the most lengthy and graphic projectile vomiting in film history (giving Monty Python's The Meaning of Life a run for its money), a very graphic sex scene, and some wonderful songs that make fun of everything from Michael Bay's PEARL HARBOR to the current wave of country-western pro-American songs.<br /><br />Oh, and of course, it's all done with puppets.  This makes virtually every clich&eacute; the movie indulges in very funny instead of clich&eacute;d.  (Hey, he's giving a clich&eacute;d "rah-rah" speech...but he's a puppet, so it's funny.)<br /><br />My wife and I (both in our early 40s) had tears running down our faces during much of this movie.  It's so over-the-top, so shocking and yet so right on the money about most of the subjects it pokes fun at.  To really enjoy it, I think, you have to have some idea of current affairs.  If you don't understand that during the last election, a big group of celebrities worked really hard to prevent Bush from being reelected, you might wonder why all these celebrities go to North Korea.  If you don't know who Hans Blix, the UN weapons inspector, is...you won't understand the scene he's in.<br /><br />Also, folks, please don't take little kids to this.  It's packed with so much cussing, so much racist humor, so much graphic sex and so much adult humor (in the best possible sense), that I really think a 10-year old might be scarred for life!  But if you're an older teen or an adult with a strong stomach...have a great time.  This movie is certainly in my top 5 movies of 2004, and in my top 20 best comedies of all time.  (And I don't even like South Park much.)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="outrageous?.. yes..vulgar?.. yes..Absurd?..yes..Entertaining?.. yes.."></head><body><p>Borat will surely divide its viewers.. it is not intended to be a pc film exploring cultural differences.. it is rather a complete violation of everything pc and brings out the worst in our international relations.. But it is endearing, very funny, and its explorations of the american psyche are spot on.. I found myself more often than not laughing at the American's who confront something different than themselves and bring out the worst stereotypes of Americana.. Borat is one of the most outrageous and totally relevant portrayals of international relations in the history of cinema.. Sacha baron cohen is hilarious in his absurd yet sympathetic portrayal of Borat.. a man completely out of place who always says the wrong things according to the other culture.. I found myself thinking as much as i was laughing..</p></body></html>

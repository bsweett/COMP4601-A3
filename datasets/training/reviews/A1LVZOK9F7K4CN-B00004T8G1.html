<meta name="summary" content="One of Carpenter's better movies"></head><body><p>This is John Carpenter's follow-up to Halloween (one of the best movies ever).  This movie doesn't quite measure-up.  It's scary, but it does not have memorable characters.  It's a creepy and in-your-face horror movie.<p>The extras on the DVD, like on The Thing, tell you everything you'd want to know about the movie, and TOO MUCH MORE.  A huge problem with DVD extras is that it tends to treat every film as if it were Citizen Kane.  It could use a lot of editing.  Listening to the principals talk about the film, it's difficult to tell if they think it is a success or not.  Unfortunately, every time I've seen John Carpenter lately (in person or on TV) he seems like he's smoked a few too many doobies to ever form a coherent thought again.  It's a shame because he had so much talent.</p></body></html>

I went to see the movie at the theaters having really no interest in the movie and I found it pretty good. The movie is really disterbing at times and really sick at times but that's what it's supose to be. The movie has scary moments and gory moments to make you jump out of your seat. The acting is ok I found it to be the downfall in this movie. They tried to make Ryan Reynolds charactor to mocho and showing his body off was stupid. Overall a pretty good horror film.</p></body></html>

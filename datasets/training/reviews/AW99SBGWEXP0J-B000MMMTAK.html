<meta name="summary" content="Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"></head><body><p>Borat Sagdiyev (Cohen) is a TV reporter from Kazakhstan who embarks on a journey to America to make a documentary of the United States for his home country with the hope that they can learn from us.  His producet Azamat (Davitian) accompanies him on his journey.  Soon, in New York City, Borat discovers and falls in love with Pamela Anderson after watching "Baywatch".  He decides that he will not only film in New York, but all across the country, ending up in California where he hopes to meet the "virginal" Pamela Anderson.  Along the way, he learns how to drive, adopts a bear, gets humor lessons, sings at a rodeo, and wrestle with Azamat.<br /><br />This is easily the funniest movie I have seen this year.  Sacha Baron Cohen has created an idiot character that exposes the prejudices of the unsuspecting people he interacts with.  Most of what he says is cringeworthy, as he has the ability to say the exact wrong thing to the various people he runs into.  This movie is not for everyone, in fact there is surely something in this movie to offend everyone, but there is more to it than you might initially think.  I highly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

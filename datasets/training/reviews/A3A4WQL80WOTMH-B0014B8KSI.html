Though I am partial to horses coming up out of nowhere and staring you in the face for a while in some deserted place (as it once happened to me!).<br /><br />The movie was kind of diffuse and obtuse in the beginning with a flashback story which let it be told in a somewhat off-hand manner, building tension as it goes along, but you have to pay attention (a good movie to watch with the SUBTITLES on).  All the same, once it gets going it does keep your attention.  The acting and suspense are pretty good with occasional moments of soul - compliments of the horses.  A nice touch.</p></body></html>

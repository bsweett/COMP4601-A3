<meta name="summary" content="An uncomfortable blend of Japanese stoicism and American sentiment"></head><body><p>"Letters from Iwo Jima" tells the story of the American attack on the tiny island of Iwo Jima during WWII from the perspective of its Japanese defenders.<br /><br />This film, although although OK on its own terms, suffers in comparison to the "other" Iwo Jima movie that director Clint Eastwood filmed at the same time - the excellent "Flags of our Fathers", which tells the story from the American perspective.<br /><br />Eastwood is less comfortable telling this story and it ends up being an uncomfortable mixture of Japanese stoicism and American sentiment, which as not as moving as it would like to be.<br /><br />Given the dearth of WWII films from the Japanese perspective, this film tries to make up for it by packing in so many characters and subplots it eventually becomes wearisome.<br /><br />The performances are all excellent especially Ken Watanabe as the Japanese commander - General Tadamichi Kuribayashi - but Eastwood misses the bullseye with this one.</p></body></html>

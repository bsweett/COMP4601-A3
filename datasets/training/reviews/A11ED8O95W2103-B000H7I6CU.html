The beginning of this film is one long torturous session with "Lightning McQueen" who is to me the most non endearing character ever in any Pixar movie.  One dumb gag and cliche after another, and some genuinely bad writing, like when McQueen says "I'm a one man show".  Hey, there is no "man" in the Cars universe, so why would a car say something like that?<br /><br />Thankfully I gave it another chance and decided to watch it on my little flatpanel while walking on my treadmill.  The movie starts to really move when it slows down.  The 116 minutes is considered by some to be too long, but it added a lot of time for character development, and McQueen needed to develop a lot of character.<br /><br />To be brief, the beautifully rendered little world of Radiator Springs and its assortment of cute -- if rather one dimensional -- characters provided a context for McQueen to accept responsibility for his actions, grow up, and start thinking of vehicles other than himself.  The Porsche saved the movie for me.  She at least had some depth.<br /><br />I liked "Doc" too.  His story added another lesson to the story, that is, don't discount those who came before you. They're smarter than you think.<br /><br />I found the ending rather predictable (I was sure what would happen, but I just didn't know exactly how it would happen), but I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't yet seen the movie.<br /><br />So, three stars for a decent morality play and some mind bogglingly beautiful animation, and a tribute to motoring history.  Two stars off for shallow cliche characters (or should I say car-actors) and for having tons of eye-candy but a dearth of adult humor, and by "adult" I mean genuinly subtle and funny humor, not crass toilet humor.  With all it's strengths, Cars was a difficult movie for me to emotionally bond with, unlike the other Pixar films.<br /><br />Oh yeah, how is it that McQueen left Radiator Springs with whitewalls and that solid red and white paint pattern and then rolls out of Mac the next morning at the speedway back in his original paint, stickers, and tires.  Did I miss something?<br /><br />And, in real car racing you don't get to purposely collide with other cars and knock them off the track.  Chick Hick would have been banned from auto racing and likely charged with a felony in the real racing world.  They went so far to duplicate the realism of NASCAR, and I know cars sometimes touch, but it ain't supposed to be roller-derby, is it?<br /><br />The bonus featurs are fun, like the "One Man Band" cartoon and the extra "Cars" cartoon.  The "deleted scenes" are storyboard style but show how the movie could have been done differently, which I found quit interesting.<br /><br />Finally, this DVD just seems like "round one".  A year from now there will likely be the "Special Two-Disc Ultra Ka-Chow" version with multiple commentaries, documentaries, etc.  So, if you buy this version, I think you'll likely be buying Cars again.</p></body></html>

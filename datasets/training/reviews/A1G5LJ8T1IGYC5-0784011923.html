THIS 1984 CLASSIC IS ABOUT AN UNSTOPPABLE KILLER CYBORG FROM THE FUTURE [ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER] WHO TRAVELS BACK TO 1984 LOS ANGELES TO KILL AN INNOCENT WOMAN NAMED SARAH CONNOR [LINDA HAMILTON], LITTLE KNOWING THAT A MAN NAMED REESE [MICHAEL BIEHN] WAS SENT TO TRY AND PROTECT HER. THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST ACTION/SCI-FI MOVIES EVER MADE. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS GOOD. THERE'S EXCELLENT SPECIAL EFFECTS, EXCELLENT ACTION SEQUENCES, AND EXCELLENT PERFORMANCES. THIS CLASSIC IS SOMETIMES UNDERRATED IN COMPARISON TO ITS 1991 SEQUEL ''TERMINATOR 2; JUDGMENT DAY''. ALTHOUGH THIS MOVIE MAY NOT BE NOWHERE NEAR AS HIGH TECH AS TERMINATOR 2 OR 3, THIS IS EASILY THE BEST OF THE 3. ONE HAS TO WONDER, WHY COULDN'T MICHAEL BIEHN GET ANYMORE HIGH PROFILE ROLES? HE DID SO GREAT IN THIS MOVIE. I ALMOST WISH HIS CHARACTER RETURNED FOR T2. IN MY BOOK, THIS IS A DEFINITE 5-STAR CLASSIC, THE SUCCESS OF THIS MOVIE INSPIRED MANY CLONES AND IMITATIONS, BUT NONE OF THEM EVEN COME CLOSE TO TOPPING THIS FANTASTIC MOVIE. I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS FILM TO ANY ACTION OR SCI-FI MOVIE BUFF. THE SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDE ORIGINAL PREVIEW TRAILERS, TV SPOTS, DELETED SCENES, AND MORE. YA JUST CAN'T HATE THIS MOVIE.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not scary, but creepy"></head><body><p>This isn't a "jump" horror film. It's considered a horror film for its general eerieness and beautifully creepy images. It's also a horror film for the many decapitations that are found in this film, so if you have a weak stomach, you've been warned.<br /><br />Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci give out brilliant performances for the younger crowd, while Michael Gambon and Miranda Richardson will grab the attention of the older crowd. Christopher Walken is absolutely freaky as the Hessian [headless] horseman, while Christopher Lee's small role is a treat. Casper Van Dien, Ian McDiarmand, Jeffrey Jones, and Michael Gough are an excellent supporting cast.<br /><br />Tim Burton's imagination has been put to good use once again: sets and costumes are truly gothic and beautiful to look at. Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay could've improved a bit with more polish and sheen, but it's only a minor flaw. Danny Elfman strikes again with his unique musical style (the main theme will have people shivering).<br /><br />So if you're a Burton or Elfman or Depp or Ricci or Walken fan, then this is the film for you.

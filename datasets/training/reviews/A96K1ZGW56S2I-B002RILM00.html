<meta name="summary" content="The Original Is Better."></head><body><p>There are several points during THE WICKER MAN that Edward Malus (Nicolas Cage) has a pained look of exasperation on his face as he vainly searches to find a missing child, Rowan Woodward (Erika-Shayne Gair), on a mysterious and isolated island off the coast of Washington State that is ruled by a cult of pagan women.  The look on Malus face could very well be that of Cage as he slowly realized the horror of a movie that he had gotten himself into.  Not that Cage is at fault.  Nicolas is a great actor and despite having a resume that includes some of the most dismal pictures ever made (LEAVING LAS VEGAS), his very presence in a movie makes it a better picture than it would have been otherwise.  He's got the everyman appeal of Tom Hank, the charm of Cary Grant, and the acting skills of Al Pacino.  No, Nicolas Cage isn't the problem with this remake of THE WICKER MAN.  In fact, he's one of the reasons someone should see this movie.<br /><br />Perhaps, the plot and script are the culprit.  The film has changed greatly from the original cult classic that starred Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee.  The location is set in the U.S. on a small, isolated island off the coast of Puget Sound (the locations are amazing) instead of an isolated isle off near Scotland (is there such thing as an isolated island near Puget Sound anymore?).  Instead of a pagan cultic community taking desperate measures to bring favor to their gods, there is an enclosed community of women misandrists performing a ritual they perform every generation (by the way for those who believe in THE DA VINCI CODE, this is the type of world you would live in if that was true).  There are some major plot holes, e.g. the girl and mother who supposedly die in a fiery car crash and why exactly do the women worship bees again?  Nevertheless, much of the original THE WICKER MAN's key moments are a part of the film and the feminist cult setting updates and contemporizes the original film's tone in a way that would make most remade films proud; different but true to the original spirit (Edward Woodward who starred in the original THE WICKER MAN was offered a role in the film but declined to take it, but stated that he was "surprisingly impressed by the quality of the script" of the remake).<br /><br />No, the problem with this THE WICKER MAN isn't the acting or plot. It is the characterization.  Nicolas Cage does a great job, but Officer Edward Malus does not seem like a very likeable person.  He enjoys helping people and has a great deal of those two distinctive American qualities of individuality and self-reliance.  He's also very rugged and seems to be the type of person who would make a great golf partner or drinking buddy.  However, he's not at all like what Sister Rose (Molly Parker) calls him: quixotic.  No, Officer Malus is anything but quixotic (the school teachers at Summerisles are apparently even less intelligent than the students they teach).  Don Quixote was a nobleman who believed in an ideal.  Quixote's ideal might have seemed unrealistic and crazy, but it was an ideal that inspired those around him to live better lives than they would have otherwise.  Edward Malus isn't like that.  He seems more like someone suffering with bipolar disorder:  one moment he's very outgoing and jovial, the next he's yelling at the top of his voice and on the verge of throwing something or hitting something.  He willfully disrespects the law once he enters Summerisles, even though he is a man who is supposed to uphold the law.  He chases away the people who care from him most away either because won't let them get too close or because they are afraid of his angry wrath.  In short, he's a jerk. When Malus meets his fate, the audience doesn't really care.  Sure, it's all very violent and horrifying.  Yet, the audience is given the impression that it might have been a good thing.<br /><br />That's not what THE WICKER MAN is supposed to be about.  The original film was about a noble man (who was indeed quixotic) who met a very undeserved, horrifying, and grisly demise.  That original film is wicked because the bad guys seem to win.  The noble ideal is extinguished in flames of pagan lust.  That doesn't happen in this film.  Sure what Malus has to endure is horrifying, but because he doesn't represent an ideal, it's not all that shocking.<br /><br />THE WICKER MAN could have been an excellent film in the suspense/horror genre that added to the original movie it was remade from.  Instead, THE WICKER MAN isn't all that different from any other teen horror movie.</p></body></html>

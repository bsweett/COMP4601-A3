<meta name="summary" content="Creepy Horrorlike Tale for Kids"></head><body><p>This is a great movie with a horror theme, but hardly terrifying.  A young girl moves into an old house broken into apartments.  There is an empty apartment there where a secret world lives and the girl Coraline runs into.  Coraline goes through a bricked up door and finds another mother and another father very similar to her own but nicer and more interested in her.  She is invited to stay with them forever if only she agrees to allow them to sew buttons into her eyes.  Coraline finds this wonderful secret world has a terrible dark side.  The author Neil Gaiman wrote the book that the story comes from and it is great.  I used the Graphic novel in school and followed it up with the movie.  My students are middle school students and we had a great time.  The kids loved the book and the movie.  It wasn't too scary but very intriguing to them.</p></body></html>

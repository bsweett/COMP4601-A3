<meta name="summary" content="4.3 stars - Good"></head><body><p>Im not big into zombie movies but this was REALLY GOOD. Im sure it was a classic for its time. It is one of the most grusome movies Ive seen and ive seen many horror movies. The director is an amazing filmmaker. I dont get shocked or scared easy but this one shocked me. I wasnt really scared by it but when the zombies start eating people it shocked me , it was so realistic. The plot is good to. I recomend this for zombie fans or just horror fans in general like me. I dont like most zombie movies and this one I enjoyed. The only part i wish wouldve been diffrent were the ending, it couldve been better. The actors were pretty good and the zombies great. The makeup work, the violence IS A++++ the best. Highly recomended. Classic. Id say in general its a 4 star movie but among horror films a 4.5.</p></body></html>

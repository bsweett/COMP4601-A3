If this movie had been made by some fledgling, no-name outfit struggling to survive, it would be hailed as a work of beauty, simplicity, and charm.  As it is, a lot of people are just groaning because it resembles so many past formulaic outings of Disney.<br /><br />But this one is particularly well-done.  There's a reason you keep seeing formulas in movies:  THEY WORK.  This is probably the best-wrought animated Disney movie I've seen since "The Little Mermaid."<br /><br />There were two things that stuck out in my mind as particularly excellent:<br /><br />1.  The completely unexpected yet captivating way that the horse Maximus stole the show from the middle of the movie onwards.<br /><br />2.  The relationship between the mother and the daughter.  This was bitingly, spookily convincing.  I don't know who wrote that, but there's more than a dose of reality in there.  For me, the mother is the most comprehensively convincing villain I've ever seen from Disney.</p></body></html>

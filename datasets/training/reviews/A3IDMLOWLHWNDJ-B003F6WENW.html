<meta name="summary" content="Its A Nice Day To Crash A White Wedding..."></head><body><p>"Why don't you try to getting jacked off under the table in front of the whole god*amn family, jacka*s & have some real problems." - Jeremy tells John he don't know jack about taking one for the team in "Wedding Crashers"<br /><br />Owen Wilson & Vince Vaughn star in the funniest film of 2005.<br /><br />"Wedding Crashers" is a raunchy, always funny, film that is worth owning on DVD.<br /><br />John Beckwith & Jeremy Grey have been lifelong friends. While both are divorce mediators during the week, on the weekend they do, what they do best - crash weddings. With different identities, & getting all the needed info on the families, the boys head off to the weddings with one thing in mind. To score with one of the hot girls at the reception (they check out whose who at the wedding & at the reception, make their move).<br /><br />Their crashing is about to catch up with them, when they crash the wedding of the Secratary Treasurer's oldest daughter. John sets his sights on the Secretary's middle daughter, Claire, while Jeremy makes it with the Secretary's youngest daughter, Gloria. Things get complicated when John is ready to give up his crashing ways, falling, hard, in love with the Claire, while Jeremy finds Gloria really possessive & invites both boys to spend the weekend with her & her family. John seizes the day, while Jeremy wants to turn tail & run. The first rule of being a Wedding Crasher is never leave your fellow man & Jeremy joins John for the weekend. The fun begins, as long as they don't get caught.<br /><br />"Wedding Crashers" is the most raunchiest film, possibly since "American Pie". Their are a lot of classic scenes. The cast is awesome.<br /><br />The DVD will be released on January 3rd, 2006, with deleted scenes including the "99 baloons" scene, director commentary, 8 1/2 minutes of extra footage,& a crash course in wedding crashing.<br /><br />Life is a party. Crash it.</p></body></html>

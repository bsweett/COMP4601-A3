<meta name="summary" content="ATTACKING THE SYSTEM"></head><body><p>Plea bargaining has always been an enigma to me.  Purportedly done for "the greater good" these deals do carry collateral damage and make our justice system less admirable.  Such is the case with LAC.  Initially I was sympathetic to Gerard Butler's character but once he goes on multiple killings, he's nothing more than a psychotic killer and you can't cheer him on.<br />The movie is artfully done and the acting is very good...one of Butler's best and Jamie Foxx's restrained performance is compatible with Butler's rage.<br />The accomplice theory is somewhat explained in a contrived ending but not to the detriment of the entertainment value.</p></body></html>

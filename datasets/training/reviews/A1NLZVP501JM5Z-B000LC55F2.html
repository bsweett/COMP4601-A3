If you guess one twist you get hit by 3 more you didn't see coming.  I loved it.  The action, suspense, mystery, drama.  Christopher Nolan is becoming one of the best directors out there.<br /><br />The acting is fantastic.  Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, and Michael Caine all are great.  I love the accent on Bale's character.  The biggest achievement for me though was that I forgot I was watching Batman, Wolverine, Gollum, and Alfred.  I really felt I knew these characters.  That is a huge credit to Nolan and the actors.  I actually think Jackman is a great actor now and not just a great action actor.  He gives a helluva performance.  Bale is also extraordinary.  I could keep going on and on, but I'll stop.  Just go see this movie.  I smell Oscars!<br /><br />Oh.  Do not GO TO THE BATHROOM OR LEAVE THE THEATRE!!!!!!!!!!!  If you do you might miss a big twist(they happen a lot).</p></body></html>

Yeah, it could have been cut, with perhaps the saved time being used to develop further the relationship with the mistress [hopeful] and with the wife. But still. I was on the edge of my seat each time that creepy voice on the other end of the line chuckled and commanded the poor guy to reach for the gun overhead. Although the tension was high, the end was predictable - but if for nothing else, the movie is worth watching just for the scenes with the hookers who want that guy OUT of the phone booth.<br />Four stars.</p></body></html>

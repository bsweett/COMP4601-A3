It's a sign of the times, considering how jaded everyone is with all the onslaught of killings and violence in so many movies.  The "Saw" movies seem to be quite popular, they take violence to the extreme, over-do it like they weren't hugged enough by their mothers, and rely on a so-so storyline that's rehash, yet people love it, to each his own.  "Hostel 2" manages to continue the story without being predictable and unleashing more insight about the heart of the story, the murder club and the people involved.  Part 2 is filmed more artsy, the killings more poetic and not as torturous as the shocking first one.  By this time I was more acclamated to the deceiving first steps in capturing the victims, so I wasn't as shocked as I was when viewing the first Hostel.  One thing Eli Roth does extremley well is flip the script because it's hard to surprise me.  Like I was surprised that he killed off the nice n' nerdy girl first, I thought she was going to be the one running all alone in the woods at the end.  Humanity doesn't mean a thing in the Hostel movies, there is no compassion and no heart at all, and that is what makes these films as sick and disturbing as they are.  I do agree however that Mr. Roth would have pushed the gore to the next level, bump it up a notch or two maybe next time around.  I hope they continue the Hostel story for at least 2-3 more, and it has to be under the realm and threshhold of Quintin Tarantino, it can be done no other way.  I hope they can continue with a fresh take and keep it original.  Eli Roth is a master at character development and chooses the right actors with the right energy, so good job for him.  Well made horror movie, the best in horror for these times.</p></body></html>

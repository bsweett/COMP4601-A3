<meta name="summary" content="Jeepers Creepers this movie gave me the Creeps!"></head><body><p>I suppose that a lot of people going to the movies today have grown up on such tripe as Scary Movie, the Friday the 13th series and other crappy horror films.  I suppose these same people expect that every little detail of a film must be explained on an adolescent's level, so as not to confuse them while they watch the films with their eyes as their mouths cannot keep from running while in the theatre.  It's a funny thing - sound when added to a film allowed for certain nuances of the theatre to be present, so that the visual didn't have to do all the work.  So to those who would call this film bad, I say:  turn off your cell phone, stop talking to your buddies, and pay attention to the movie.<p>Jeepers Creepers isn't the finest horror film ever made, but it certainly is one that can scare the bejesus out of you.  Certainly there are very standard plot devices in action here - but isn't that part of the formula for a horror film?  ... <p>Jeepers starts off using bits and pieces of known scare tactics and then milks them with a wink and a nudge.  Should the lead characters go back and see whats up at that creepy looking house where the even creepier looking guy was ....?  Of course not!  The characters even acknowledge this fact.  However, pulled by the same force that requires everyone passing an accident to rubberneck, they do.  (And let's face it - if they didn't - the movie wouldn't have been made).<br />At once scary, silly, laughable, and immensely frustrating, Jeepers Creepers shows us a new (albeit traditional and truly old hat) villain: a monster! .<br />Just what this monster wants is never fully explained as the film truly frustrates us by setting itself up for an obvious sequel (which I truly hope gets made).<br />The film features fine actors performing honestly and well.  Eileen Brennan appears in an extended cameo that is quite unforgettable.  The script is good, the cinematography is quite well done.<br />When you get up from a horror film, you are hopefully intelligent enough to know that the action on the screen is not possible in the real world.  You have just been treated to little fright akin to a ride on a good roller coaster.  If the movie made you jump, squirm, turn from the screen, or possibly yelp, then its done its job.<br />Jeepers Creepers does far more than that.  This is a good film that delivers on the scares and leaves you wanting more.<br />Check it out!</p></body></html>

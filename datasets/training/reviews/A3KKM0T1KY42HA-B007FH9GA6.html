And we all know that Director David Fincher simply re-did this American version of the film albeit with a completely different cast, right? And we all know that the movie(s) is based on the first of three books in a trilogy by Sweedish Author Stieg Larsson (RiP), right? And we all know that the original title of the book and movie were changed from Men Who Hate Women to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo so that it would be well received marketingwise in the US and not perceived as a bash against men by antisexism groups, right? And finally, we all know that two more films in the trilogy have already been released with the Sweedish cast (with less than positive reviews) and that Sony says the American cast has signed on for re-dos of the two sequels here in the US...right?<br /><br />Whew. With all that out of the way, I thought The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was very good. Two story lines woven together nicely. The first story line follows Journalist Mikael Blomkvist after being convicted of libel for accusing a high powered businessman of unethical and illegal activity. The widely publicized trial brings Blomkvist to the attention of another high powered businessman named Vanger who is looking for a long lost niece; Vanger thinks Blomkvist would be the perfect person to solve the mystery of his 40 years missing niece.<br /><br />Enter storyline 2: Vanger has hired a Goth lady named Lisbeth to determine if Blomkvist is the right man to hunt for his niece. And the story arcs from there to the struggles of Lisbeth's everyday life of trying to make ends meet while on probation for some crimes committed in her relatively distant past. Be warned, like the Swedish version, there are some scenes of rape and torture that are very unsettling and difficult to sit through in this film.<br /><br />Ultimately, both story lines are brilliantly connected with each other in a thriller tale of intrigue, deception, mystery, murder and revenge. It's a very good movie that stands on its own with no cliffhanger ending that requires seeing the upcoming sequels. Highly recommended but not for the squeamish.<br /><br />Having seen the original film I found myself involuntarily comparing Fincher's US version to the Sweedish version a few times during the film. And there was something about the original Sweedish version that made everything so much more real...especially Lisbeth, the character played by Rooney Mara. Fincher made Lisbeth somewhat of a, how should I say this?..."anti-superhero???" While Noomi Rapace played Lisbeth in the Sweedish version with a seriousness that made you think she was a real person out there somewhere, and that a camera followed her like a fly on the wall. Mara was good, but Rapace was great.</p></body></html>

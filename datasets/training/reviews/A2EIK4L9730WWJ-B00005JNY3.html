<meta name="summary" content="A GREAT FIRST CLASS THRILLER!!!!!!!!"></head><body><p>The Skeleton Key is just a basic edge of your seat thriller and Kate Hudson does a wonderful job in the movie!!!!!! I liked this movie,because they don't use special effects and i liked that they filmed it in Louisiana!!!!! When Kate applies for a new care giver job she realizes that the house that she is staying in is haunted by ghosts and by the magic of voodoo!!!!! Its up to Kate to get this old man out of the house and same for her!!!!!!!! This movie almost reminded me of The Sixth Sense and The Serpent and the Rainbow which by the way great flicks to check out!!!!!! If you are in a video store then go pick yourself a copy of this edgy thriller you will enjoy it!!!!!</p></body></html>

And being that I have grown up with Harry, Hermoine, and Ron, I feel for them as I would for a family member. There are true scenes of terror in this latest movie, and the music can be very alarming. I got the feeling I was watching a well done political thriller at times. This movie is almost entirely about the characters that we love most: Harry, Hermoine, and Ron. In my opinion some of the best acting of the franchise is displayed in this excellent movie.<br /><br />The Deathly Hallows was almost painful for me to watch though, as I have grown up with these characters and I care for them all so much. Harry, Hermoine, and Ron are still young, but the cruel world throws them out into the fire where anything may meet them! They are hiding, scared, and alone from powerful forces bent on their deaths. Everything they love is in peril, or has fallen and nobody can be trusted outside of themselves. The thoughts of the loved ones left behind drive them to stay up all night thinking about them in unconsolible agony. The three camp in woods, with only enough supplies to survive, and in places little traveled by people. Each wearing thinner daily by the impossible burden of perhaps being the last hope.<br /><br />The warm guidance and protection of those that love them are ALL gone except in memory. It is up to them, with barely enough knowledge to suffice, and definately not enough experience! And it drives me to worrying fits, because I don't know what's going to happen to these kids. I have refrained myself from reading the novels until I have seen all the movies. I have kept myself from overhearing anything about the books, and now I am in complete mystery, and it thrills me, but also it holds me in agony at times. I was reminded how young these guys still are when Hermoine was crying like a child. I wanted to protect her and kill the people who harmed her! You forget how young the characters are because of how grim, and aged they behave at times.<br /><br />It is not only their world that is in peril, but the world that I have come to know extensively, and that I have appreciated, and held in my imagination with awe and wonder. It seems every new movie had been a slow death of that world. A piece of it would die and not return. There are real consequences in this world, though it be fantasy, it is filled with real moments of loss. Every scene is weighted down with danger. Every corner is dangerous, and may have some terrible consequence. Terrible thoughts went through my head; and there were times when I had lost hope. I can't remember when I watched a movie with such emotional responses.<br /><br />This is a movie that I instantly loved, and will watch many, many times. I am convinced that the end movie will be historic. I cannot wait for next July for the supreme finale. I am sad that it is coming to an end, but I am also very happy that it will be filmed will nearly all of the original cast in the end. I believe this is the movie of the year. Enough of this "It's a good harry potter movie." No, it's a great, epic MOVIE. I highly recommend this tragic, Dangerous, and Emotional movie.</p></body></html>

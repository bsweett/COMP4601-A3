It is a lovely mix of suffering, love, fulfillment, discovery, and reconciliation.<br /><br />BRAVO.<br /><br />See also:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6BJ56">Joyeux Noel (Widescreen)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001GH7W2">Bonhoeffer</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005S6K8">Sabrina</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790732181">One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</a></p></body></html>

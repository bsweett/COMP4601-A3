<meta name="summary" content="First-Rate Mystery Thriller That Floors You With Real Shocks"></head><body><p>A group of seemingly unconnected characters become stormstayed at a remote motel, where one by one, they begin to disappear.  Sounds familiar but promising; while the promise is more than fulfilled though, the familiarity is not, as a classic kind of idea gives way to one of the most original and twist-filled movies around.  It's astonishing how cavalier the treatment of this movie was when it first came out, regarding its genuinely shocking ending - I had the misfortune of inadvertently reading the ending in a small ad prior to its DVD release!  Even with advance knowledge of the outcome, though, it was still astounding - I can only imagine how jaw-dropping it must be to witness it not knowing.  Fantastic suspense; great characterization as played by a cast of well-knowns including John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Rebecca DeMornay and Ray Liotta; excellent production values; and total non-telegraphing of the plot combine to make "Identity" one of the greatest mystery shockers of all time.  If you don't know the ending, do yourself a favor and see this one as soon as possible - the turns are some of the most unexpected ever.  Even if you do know the gist of it, don't hesitate to see it - it'll still deliver many times over.  Indispensable for fans of mystery, drama, horror, or thrillers.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Funny but not hilarious"></head><body><p>I liked it. Not as much as I expected because of all the hoopla over how great it was. Even the librarian who checked me out fussed over it "This movie is so funny!". I think my sense of humor has changed as I get older. I think when I was under 30, I would have loved this flick.<br /><br />Grandma was a hoot. And the best scene is when Vince Vaughn gets tied up in bed and gets three separate visitors. Don't want to say too much and ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it. Which it seems everyone who plans on has. I think it could have been shorter because I was getting antsy during the last 20 minutes or so.</p></body></html>

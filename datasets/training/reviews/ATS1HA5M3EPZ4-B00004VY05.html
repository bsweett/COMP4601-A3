This movie may star Bruce Willis but this was the beginning of his search for alternative roles.  This is a Science Fiction movie that does not rely on the Science Fiction to entertain.  It is light hearted, exciting, often funny and a blast to watch.  So many aspects to this movie are well balanced into the story, but at the same time, it remains human on all levels.  The incredible set pieces and visual affects never overtake the story.  Luc Besson does a great job of directing Willis, who plays a retired Military Major (retired due to personal reasons) who is asked to take on a mission of great importance.  He falls into protecting Lelu (Mila Jovavich), a beautiful and prophesized individual (woman) who is expected to save the world.  The adventure that they go through is fun to watch.  Willis' character falls for Lelu, being an expert soldier doesn't keep him from feeling what he knows is there.  As the movie moves on, we are treated to some of the most original set pieces, make up, creatures and costumes that we have ever seen.  The mood of the movie is brighter then you would think, considering some of the scenes deal directly with death and destruction.  All the actors are good and appear to be having a great time making this movie.  Gary Oldman is particularly evil as the Corporate guru who cares nothing for anyone.  Chris Tucker is introduced in this movie and is extremely obnoxious, but hilarious at the same time.  All in all, this movie may not be ground breaking or provocative, but it takes many elements we all know and gives us The Fifth Element, something original, fun and highly entertaining.</p></body></html>

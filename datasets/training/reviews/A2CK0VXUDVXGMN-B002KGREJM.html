<meta name="summary" content="The Truth Would Have Been Interesting"></head><body><p>Rather than using a fictionalized version through the eyes of a rather uninteresting (except for the Scottish accent), and utterly naive doctor as his improbable right hand man, why not writer a screenplay based upon Idi Amin's actual life and tailspin into the cliched king whose power and paranoia drives him crazy with bloodlust?<br /><br />Now, that would have been a film I may have watched to the end - not this one.  It fizzled, then left one wanting.<br /><br />Yes, Forest Whitaker gave a superb performance, but not enough to save this bad screenplay.</p></body></html>

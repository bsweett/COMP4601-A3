<meta name="summary" content="GOOD! BUT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER! EXTENDED VERSION IS AN IMPROVEMENT"></head><body><p>I read this comic as a kid, so when I went to see this movie in the theater, I expected great things! After the wonderful treatment they did with Spiderman, I thought this has got to be great!...right?... Wrong! Let me start off by saying I did like this movie, but it could have been better. After seeing the film, I went home and dug out an old FF comic and was surprised how close they came to capturing the essence of the comic.<br /><br />Jessica Alba who is great to look is the weakest of the foursome and her chemistry with Reed is not truly believable. The Thing and Torch were spot on, with the exception to the Thing missing his signature rock uni-eyebrow! Mr. Fantastic is played well by Ioan Gruffudd, but I was not too impressed with Doctor Doom's look and story change. I guess, like in the "Spiderman" films, some characters don't translate well into a live action movie(Green Goblin).<br /><br />The extended edition is an improvement even though there are a few awkward scenes added with the same dialogue. The new extras on extended edition make the double dip well worth your money.</p></body></html>

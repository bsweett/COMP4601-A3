<meta name="summary" content="An Oily Citizen Kane"></head><body><p>For a while, I thought the arc of this movie was going to parallel the classic "Citizen Kane" trajectory, with Daniel Day-Lewis' character rising from humble beginnings and snatched opportunities as an oil well rigger - to a hollow, rattling, rambling millionaire alone amidst his riches. However, just as I thought I had the character's conclusion pegged that way, the movie made another catapult into new territory.<br /><br />Everything about this movie proceeds by jagged, akimbo grasshopper leaps, like the ones that might be made by the giant grasshopper-like well pumps that dominate the film's landscapes. "Blood" has a distinctive beat to its plot - just as its score has a distinctive beat marked by industrial clanks and crunches.<br /><br />The plot is loosely based on Upton Sinclair's book, "Oil," exposing the greed and chicanery rampant in the oil mining industry. However where Sinclair's book made the protagonist's adversaries a consortium of industrialists - this movie made Lewis' main adversaries a group of religious fundamentalists. That was a daring choice, but it does give the action another dimension.<br /><br />Paul Dano is superb as the two-faced religious leader - so smooth and passively faith-basted on the one hand - so much the raging tyrant on the other. However Daniel Day-Lewis brings in the tour de force performance as oilman extraordinaire. This is a memorable film on all scores.</p></body></html>

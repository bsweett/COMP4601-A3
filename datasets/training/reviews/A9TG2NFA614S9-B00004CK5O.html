In 1954 I was stationed in Vienna with the U.S. military police company that included the International Patrol featured in the movie. Seeing the streets I knew so well was a treat. I saw the movie in 1949 and like many others was captivated by the Anton Karas's zither title theme and music from the movie.<br /> What makes this a classic motion picture?--the superb acting (particularly Joseph Cotton, Orson Welles, Trevor Howard, and Alida Valli), the flashes of humor (witness the Wilfred Hyde-White scenes), the gripping black and white photography, the suspense, the chase sequences (especially the one with the little boy chasing and accusing the couple through the dark streets), the use of ominous shadows, the build-up of the mystery of the third person at the death scene, the use of Vienna as a major player, and the innovative zither sound track.<br /> Also: the great direction by Carol Reed surpassing Hitchcock's similar work, the love interest, the enormity of Harry Lime's crime in human terms, the little insights into characters (Baron Kurtz and Dr. Winkel were probably lovers), the police procedural component (the British military police), and Graham Greene's great script based upon his novel. Like other golden movies, it is able to draw you into its being so you get completely enveloped in it like a Venus fly trap. Great movies transport you into their world.<br /> Some footnotes: The movie has some eccentric characters as side effects. Reed focuses on little details that catch the viewer's attention like Lime's cat. The sleazy Casanova Club is part of the Viennese backdrop. Lime is a boy who "never grew up." Popescu says, "Everybody ought to be careful in a city like this." Lime hides in the shadows, and Cotton is unaware of it as he says, "Come out, come out, whoever you are." The giant ferris wheel in the Prader was a sight I had to see and ride for myself after having seen it in the movie. The chase in the sewers stays with you long after you have seen the movie.<br /> It's a movie I never tire of.</p></body></html>

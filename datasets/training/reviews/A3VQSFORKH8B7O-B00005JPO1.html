<meta name="summary" content="INDY RETURNS IN FINE SEQUEL."></head><body><p>After nineteen years since he rode off into the sunset, the James Bond of archeology returns in "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull." And overall, the wait was worth it. The film once again includes the wit, humor and excitement fans have come to love. Where the film's weakness lies is in the last forty minutes, which features some truly outlandish moments.<br />The film's weaknesses are made up for by a terrific cast. Harrison Ford still embodies the role of Indy, and adds some great emotional impact as he discusses the passage of time. Karen Allen is again fantastic as Marion Ravenwood, while Shia LaBeouf is really good as Mutt Williams. Cate Blanchett, Ray Winstone, Jim Broadbent and John Hurt give great supporting performances. The visual effects, action sequences and exotic locales are all impressive.<br />Overall, this is a welcomed return to the world of Indiana Jones. While it does feature some truly bizarre moments, fans will find much to enjoy in this film.<br />Grade: B+</p></body></html>

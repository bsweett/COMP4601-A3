<meta name="summary" content="Cash Me If You Can"></head><body><p>A well polished film based on the true story of a con-artist who for a time outsmarted the allmighty F.B.I. in his forgery and circulation of false cashier's checks.<br /><br />The film is a light drama surrounding the character of Leonardo DiCaprio who finds himself on his own at an early age.  He soon learns that he has good skills in being a con-man and forging checks to get paid. He continues this scam for years but the F.B.I. under an agent played by Tom Hanks is on his tail.  The U.S. being too hot, he soon goes in hiding in France to continue his life of crime.<br /><br />This is a great film in every sense.  It is a touching drama but remains on the humorous note throughout the film.  DiCaprio played his role very well as did Christopher Walken as his father.  Tom Hanks essentially played himself as always but at least his mediocre acting skills did not tarnish the film in anyway as his character was as rigid as Joe Friday.  This is a good film to watch by the entire family: check it out!</p></body></html>

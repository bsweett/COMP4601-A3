<meta name="summary" content="Not a bad sequel to this famous Disney series"></head><body><p>I was relunctant to see this at first because of watching the other "Pirates of the Caribbean" series.  They showed the sneak previews of this movie OVER and OVER again, and I wass going to skip it at the theatres and wait for the DVD (which I did).  I finally purchased this when it was for sale as a regular DVD.  I didn't buy the 3 pack combo.  I was suprized at how intrested I became in the plot of Jack Sparrow in this addition.  I enjoy Johnny Depp's acting and so I wasn't disappointed in this movie.  The supporting actors and actresses did great as well.  From Penelope Cruz as a pirate and former love, to Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa and Ian McShane as the infamous Blackbeard.  The plot has twists and turns that keep your interest.  The locations and special effects in the movie are good and amusing.  The end is not bad (though you can tell who is not going to make it).  Overall, I am glad I have it in my "Pirates of the Caribbean" collection.</p></body></html>

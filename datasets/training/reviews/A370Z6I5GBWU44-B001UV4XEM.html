<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly lackluster"></head><body><p>After all the hype this movie received before I watched it, I was expecting more. It starts off promising and with several good jokes - it quickly degenerates into a slew of stupid jokes and nonsensical situations. I don't mean funny nonsense, it just felt as if the writers were just slapping this and that together in a desperate attempt to be funny.<br /><br />The bit with the tiger made absolutely no sense, and just how they stole it is not even fully explained, and I find it ridiculous that a trio of guys that were completely hopped up/stoned/drunk were able to break into a guarded mansion to steal said tiger without getting mauled. I like tigers, but this is just ridiculous. The guys try to figure out just what happened to them and why they are hungover and don't remember what happened last night. When the truth is finally revealed, it is so stupid, but then after all the stupid things that have happened, the revelation isn't much compared to that. For all the hype and jazz this movie received, this was a major letdown.</p></body></html>

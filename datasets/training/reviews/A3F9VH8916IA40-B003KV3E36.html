Although movies have been done which blend action and war drama, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000095WW8">Tears of the Sun (Special Edition)</a>99.9% of the time trying to fuse these completely polar opposite genres together is asking for a disaster. In Rambo, on one hand, you have the senseless brutality of war and genocide shown in a very shocking, and I'd say unnecessary fashion in order to play the "realism" card and try to invest the audience into the film; on the other had you have a mindless shoot em up action flick which completely contradicts any earlier attempts to establish this film as a serious look at war.<br /><br />The story starts out in Thailand, where Rambo, for some reason, has been living in the jungles since the end of the last movie catching snakes and selling them. One day, from out of the blue, a group of missionaries sent from a church in Colorado ask him to take them upstream into the neighboring country of Myanmar where they plan on helping the oppressed people living there who are being massacred by their government. At first Rambo refuses, but after the hot blond girl touches his arm and asks him nicely he changes his mind. Who knew John Rambo was such a sucker for the ladies? After he drops them off, their village gets attacked and they are taken prisoner, and big bad Rambo now has to save the day, as always. Can't a guy catch a break?<br /><br />The writers of this movie should be shot dead where they stand, or better yet Rambo should pull off his Legolas impression and shoot them though their necks. They couldn't even get the name of the country right, its called Myanmar people, not Burma. It hasn't been called Burma in years; that's like calling Thailand Siam or Russia the Soviet Union. It's an unforgivable mistake that made it almost impossible for me to take this movie seriously. Stallone, like always, gives us nothing but bad one liners and incomprehensible babble. The dialogue consists of the F word, bad one liners, fake crying, and little else. Rambo says "let's go" a lot, the mercenaries sent to help take the missionaries back say f*ck, and then everyone goes on a bloody rampage though the jungle. Acting? Script? Naw, forget about it, who needs all that when you can toss buckets of blood and rape onto the screen?<br /><br />Oh, and did I mention the violence? Yeah, there's a LOT of it. I'm a big action movie junky, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N5S5">The Terminator</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000244EMO">Predator (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004Z33EG">First Blood</a>, you name it I love it, but this new Rambo took it to a level where it didn't have to go. The senseless violence and raw brutality felt very out of place for a gun ho shoot em up action flick. As I said before, this movie tries to be something it quite frankly has no hope of being. For a great film on the realities of war, watch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001NBLVI">Saving Private Ryan (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006CXSS">Band of Brothers</a>, or for a more personal touch try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006HAWP">Grave of the Fireflies (2-Disc Collector's Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063K2C">Now and Then, Here and There (Complete Collector's Boxed Set)</a>. In Rambo, we are treated to all the harsh punishment we'd expect from a serious war film, mass killing, rape, torture, recruiting small children into the army, but are left with none of the emotional aftershock commonly associated with such films. There is no attempt to make the brutality personal or meaningful, just to make it as gross and disgusting as humanly possible. Anyone can show genocide, rape and torture, it takes a true visionary to make it feel real. That's what movies like Saving Private Ryan and Grave of the Fireflies do accomplish; that is what Rambo fails at the most.<br /><br />The extra star I gave this movie is for the action, and no I don't mean rapes and the needless bloodshed, I'm talking about when Rambo rips a guys Adams apple out of his neck, and when he slices the guts out of a man and then blows off the heads of one hundred soldiers with a 50 caliber machine gun at point blank range. It is over the top, it is gory, and yes I did roll my eyes every now and then, but it was fun. This is what the movie should have been all about, action, not a Platoon (Special Edition) want to be.<br /><br />Overall I'd say that besides the monumental disaster that was Rambo III this has got to be the weakest of the series. You can't be both Transformers and Saving Private Ryan at the same time; you have to be one or the other. Rambo is a rental, and nothing more. Do yourself a favor and see something else.<br /><br />Re-watch value; moderate.</p></body></html>

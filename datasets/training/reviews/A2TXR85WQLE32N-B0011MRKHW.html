The young and uncertain woman who became Queen in "Elizabeth" is now the mature and confident icon of her people.  Cate Blanchett reprises her role as Elizabeth.<br /><br />Director Shekhar Kapur sets three plot threads in motion at the beginning of "The Golden Age."  The first is Elizabeth's life at court, as she manages her counselors, a simmering rivalry between Protestants and Catholics, and proposals of marriage from a variety of foreign suitors. The lonely Elizabeth dotes on young "Bess" Throckmorton (Abbie Cornish), a young, attractive and trusted lady in waiting.  Enter Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), handsome swashbuckling seadog and explorer, who widens Elizabeth's horizons with tales of a new world and bewitches her heart with his charm.<br /><br />The second thread is the plotting of disgruntled Catholics against the Protestant Elizabeth.  Elizabeth's aging spymaster Walsingham (nicely reprised by Geoffrey Rush) seeks to guard her against assassination.  Her Catholic cousin and rival Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton), is imprisoned in England but schemes with English and Spanish agents against Elizabeth.<br /><br />The third thread is the threat posed by Philip II, King of Spain.  As defender of the Catholic faith, Philip intends to depose Elizabeth and is gathering a mighty naval armada and army for that purpose.<br /><br />These three plot threads are linked, sometimes in surprising ways, and they will come together to threaten Elizabeth's hold on the throne.  The savage interrogation of an arrested Catholic plotter uncovers the Spanish threat to England, while driving Bess Throckmorton into the arms of Walter Raleigh.  A failed plot against Elizabeth's life ensnares Mary Stuart, leaving Elizabeth with an agonizing choice of punishment.  Philip's armada enters the English Channel and Elizabeth must rally England's tiny navy and army to face an invasion.<br /><br />Ultimately, this becomes too many moving parts to manage gracefully.  Director Kapur handles the triangle between Elizabeth, Raleigh, and Bess Throckmorton with delicate precision to a reasonably satisfying conclusion.  However, he chooses to interpret Mary Stuart's involvement in an assassination plot to suggest that the whole was a scheme of Philip to justify going to war (a more common interpretation is that the canny Walsingham gave Mary Stuart enough rope to hang herself).  The battle with the Spanish Armada is a series of melodramatic visuals laden with religious overtones that must have been close to incomprensible to American audiences unfamiliar with English history.  Philip, in real life an outstanding chief executive of a far-flung empire, is reduced to caricature as a gnome-like fanatic muttering threats in candle-lit royal chapels.<br /><br />"Elizabeth: The Golden Age" is a visually stunning treat, taking full advantage of lavish sets and costumes to present a sense of place and time.  The underlying theme of the original "Elizabeth" movie is reinforced with a vengeance, as Elizabeth must sacrifice her personal desires to rule and safeguard England as an iconic mother figure.  A strong cast helps carry the day.  This movie is recommended as solid entertainment to fans of costume drama and period pieces.</p></body></html>

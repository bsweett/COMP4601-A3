<meta name="summary" content="Intelligent? To some, I guess ... but Dogma limps."></head><body><p>I think that's the biggest beef I have with this movie - that some actually think it's "intelligent"! How far we have fallen ...<p>Is it blasphemous? Not really ... it's too puerile in its pretensions to be blasphemous, because it ends up taking shots at an unrecognizable form of Catholicism. Monty Python, while hilarious, makes the same mistake - they've ignored Homer Simpson's "it's funny because it's true." The best humor and satire work because they things they parody and attach are represented somewhat accurately. "Dogma" spoofs a "straw God" - a God of their own invention. And falls flat.<p>Is it funny? There are a couple of funny bits, but otherwise it's actually quite lame in scripting and pace. I enjoy a good satire as much as the next guy ("Life of Brian" comes to mind, although again saddled with its confused theology. But whereas Python is enjoyable because of their silliness, "Dogma" limps because it's just stupid and shows a non-understanding of the subject matter.) "Clerks" is infinitely better in these areas. (Warning for those who haven't watched it: "Clerks" is funny but quite vulgar.) Affleck and Damon are good at delivering what passes for sophistry these days, but the heroine, Bethany, is flat, lifeless, monotonic, and sardonic. Almost as if she didn't realize the camera was rolling and it was time to act. Chris Rock suffers through awful lines. Rickman is somewhat fun, although his lines suffer from the movie's childish theology.<p>Is it parody? Satire? People, it's just not intelligent enough for either. Unless "Can God make a rock to heavy for Himself to lift" is the extent of your idea of intelligent philosophizing.<p>As for charges that the Catholic Church slept throught the Holocaust - perhaps *reading* (since we're at Amazon, after all) some actual history will prevent such tired falsehoods from showing up in scripts in the future. Wasn't a Pope honored by the Jewish people for saving Jews? Seems to ring a bell...</p></body></html>

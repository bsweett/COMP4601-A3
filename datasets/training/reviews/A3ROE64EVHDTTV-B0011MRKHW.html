<meta name="summary" content="The Golden Rage"></head><body><p>The Good Things:<br />-Looks historically/culturally accurate.<br />-Pretty good filming style with lots of good-looking shots.<br />-Excellent portrayal of Queen Elizabeth (would be comparable to Helen Mirren's performance in "Elizabeth I").  Very deep, complex, and moving.<br />-Clive Owen is in it, and does okay for himself.<br />-Strong symbolism...I think...<br /><br />The Bad Things:<br />-Action scenes are brief.<br />-Some parts are confusing unless you pay close enough attention.<br />-Some parts were shot through glass or veils, creating some wierd images (although this could also be a good thing, because it is visually mesmerizing).<br />-Action scenes are very brief; particuarly dissapointing for seeing the Spanish armada being wiped out.<br /><br />As a historical drama, this one works quite well.  It has a good style with lots of strong, memorable visuals.  Queen Elizabeth's character stands out tremendously well, and the other characters are not bad either.  However, this is not like watching "Braveheart" or anything; there are very few action scenes, and they are brief.  This is a film to see more for the artistic value, history, characters, and emotions, not for battles.<br /><br />This is the sequel to the 1998 film "Elizabeth," which also had Cate Blanchett, but one could watch this one on its own (the previous one dealt with the earlier stage of her life).</p></body></html>

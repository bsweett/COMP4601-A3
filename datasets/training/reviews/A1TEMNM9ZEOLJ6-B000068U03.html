The script here is fabulous, and of course, everything that's been said about the great cast and directing is all true. The time-shifting technique pioneered here went on to be used in quite a number of other films. And the coffee shop scenes, of course, resurfaced in Pulp Fiction and many more following movies. There's a lot of blood, but somehow it's not that gory, despite some torture that is one of the movie's most memorable sequences, set to Stealer's Wheel music. Ha. This is one of the few dvd's I have watched lately all the way through without a pause, my new standard for whether a movie is at the top of the pile. This one certainly is.</p></body></html>

There is a lot to like about Robert Rodriguez' new horror film which is just a usual run-of-the-chemical-factory zombie movie with a budget. Those who remember the zombie flicks of the 1980s, which didn't take themselves too seriously, were heavy on the splatter, and got a few laughs along with the high haemoglobin count, will be at home with Planet Terror. Those expecting something of the calibre of the Dawn of the Dead remake will not be so impressed.<br /><br />The cast contains very interesting performances, bringing some dead actors and actresses back to life. Planet Terror plays homage to every movie that has had a trickle of blood in it. There are big nods to Peter Jackson (head splitting gore) and Sam Raimi (the hero is an amputee). It does manage to try and flesh out what could have been paper-thin characters. Even the scene of one brother spilling his barbeque recipe manages a touching moment in a film which thinks having the heroine launch herself into the air from machine-gun-leg-recoil doesn't challenge our fresh brains.<br /><br />In an era of direct-to-shelf bad horror movies, Planet Terror stands out because it does its best to revive the genre.</p></body></html>

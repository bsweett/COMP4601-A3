Blues, greys, blacks, and of course a little blood red(even it is dark) combine to create an atmospheric world of evil.  Lots of flashy special effects and imaginative camerawork.  The cast does some good work:  Kate Beckinsale, Shawn Brolly, Bill Nighy, and Michael Sheen in particular; Scott Speedman walks through his role as a zombie, which is not part of the horror menu here.  So what's wrong?  The movie has no real likeable characters, as if one should like a vampire or werewolf, and there is such disregard for human or other life that it left me feeling vacant and unaffected.  Nice to look at, but empty calories.</p></body></html>

It makes no pretention to be anything else.  It is in the style of Bridget Jones (the first one) - two flawed and over-the-top stereotyped guys (in this case) get into situations that lead to comedic results.  What makes the movie good, though, is that the situations and the reactions to them are consistent and grow out of the characters, not because of plot points that must be followed.<br /><br />This is basically a guy's version of a chick flick.  It is probably not a teenager date movie (certainly not for a 1st date).  The audience at which the film is aimed is probably the same as the main characters - slightly balding, slightly pauncy 30-40 year olds (of both sexes).  Okay, only the guys will be slightly balding, but you know what I mean!  The story - two male friends take off on a road trip in a last week of "freedom" before one's wedding.  The best man, Miles, thinks this is a good opportunity to introduce his friend to the fine art of oenology (wine tasting), especially since he will be marrying into a socially elite and rich family.  That Miles is an alcoholic using this as an excuse to go drinking is obvious to the audience, but probably not to Miles himself.  The friend, Jack, wants nothing from the alcohol except as a lubricant to get as much single-guy sex in before he's tied down.<br /><br />There's no way around this description, even though it makes the two characters seem like cads.  They are - not only is Miles an alcoholic (and a petulant one at that), he even steals money from his own mother in one scene.  Jack is an amoral compulsive womaniser who cannot be convinced that anonymous sex is cheating on his fiancee.  Similarly, they lie to themselves, each other, and to the women they meet.  Somehow, though, we immediately care for them and like them, knowing objectively that they are inherently unlikeable.  Part of it is the performances by Giamatti and Church, which are very good.  The other part is the direction and the script - they are written just a little bit over-the-top, which allows the audience to relax and forgive them their foibles.  Well, the guys in the audience will, I'm not so sure of the gals.<br /><br />The women in the film are much more realistic and more subtle.  They provide the solid emotional grounding and realism that offsets the insanity revolving around the two guys.  The film is really about relationships - much is said about the wine, but that's incidental.  The movie's hook could have been anything - baseball, environmental activism, or a motorcycle club.  The characters' relations to each other (and, granted, to the object holding it all together, wine) underpins all the events in the film.  There are poignant moments, but most of the time the film is humourous in its observations about the people, and the humour grows naturally from the characters and the inextricable logic they must follow once they get themselves into the situation they are in.<br /><br />On reflection at the end, you know that in the real world, Miles would continue to be an alcoholic and Jack would promptly cheat on his wife.  But this is a pseudo-fantasy world where the people, if they don't quite live happily ever after, at least are better off then when they started.  And we have spent a satisfying and fun 2 hours with the characters, without having been cheated by a cheap and artificially contrived grand resolution.<br /><br />This DVD edition has some interesting tidbits.  The audio commentary by the two stars is fun, if not particularly informative.  There are some cut scenes, which, on seeing them, were rightfully cut.  But it's fun to see them nonetheless.</p></body></html>

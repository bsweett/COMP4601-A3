<meta name="summary" content="A visual feast, but not much depth to the story line or characters."></head><body><p>I don't believe I have ever been disappointed with a Mel Gibson movie, but this one came close.  Like "The Passion", Gibson immerses the viewer in an epic tale and an exotic culture, complete with original languages and subtitles.  The visual beauty of the production is undeniable, and the human drama of the story is played out with stark, often gut-wrenching intensity.<br /><br />Counterbalancing these strengths is, in my opinion, a shallowness to the story and the main characters.  The indomitable spirit of Jaguar Paw is the key feature, coupled closely with his love for his wife and son.  These attributes are expressed by a defiance and tenacity both in battle and in capture, as well as in the seemingly endless pursuit sequence that dominates the second half of the movie and, quite frankly, gets more than a little old after about the first 20 or 30 minutes.  Yet on and on it drags until the final predictable defeat of the pursuers and rescue of his family.<br /><br />Overall I would rate this movie as definitely worth watching, both for the excellence of the production and the tragic drama it portrays.  I have no idea how much of the story is true to the history of Mayan civilization, but Gibson certainly paints a believable picture.  In short, Gibson had in his hands the materials for a great movie, but did not maximize the opportunity.</p></body></html>

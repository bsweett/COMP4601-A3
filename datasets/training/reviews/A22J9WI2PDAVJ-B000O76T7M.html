<meta name="summary" content="Sci-fi showdown!"></head><body><p>What do you get when two popular science-fiction characters are pitted against each other in a Hollywood movie?<br /><br />"Alien vs. Predator" has made a dream showdown between science-fiction creatures. Who demanded this showdown? Viewers? Or marketing honchos? I'm guessing the honchos.<br /><br />"AVP" utilizes quality special effects to carry this film. Big money made this film worth seeing. If you were a fan of the Alien creatures or the Predators, then this film should be added to your collection.  The script could have used some fine-tuning. Did there need to be humans involved in this film? Probably not! Sanaa Lathan (Alexa Woods) fits nicely in a human lead role.  Lance Henriksen (Charles Bishop Weyland) is nothing more than recognizable character from the Alien series.<br /><br />Maybe the sequel should go something like this; eliminate the human element and go to the Predator and/or Alien's home planet. See how the Predators live, grow and utilized advanced technology.  And of course the question on how the Aliens would travel to each planet would have to be answered. Is there an advanced Alien species caretaker? A species that makes sure the Aliens feed.<br /><br />There must be one final showdown to see who survives. Answer=More merchandise.</p></body></html>

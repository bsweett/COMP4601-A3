Most of the on-the-set footage plays like home movies. The cast clearly considers "E.T." one of their own. "He was one of the kids," "E.T." mom Dee Wallace says. Charming and nostalgic to be sure, but the material probably resonates best with those connected to the production.<p>Universal Home Video has released "E.T." in two handsome sets, marking the film's debut on DVD. (Some of the material appeared on laserdisc.) Both have the heft of an event release, with fine art direction on the packages, discs and menus. Audio and video have been spit-polished; the list of extras seems mighty enough. Clearly, the money was spent.<p>Still, it all feels a bit thin. Put simply, the sets are not in the same league with well-organized, highly informative titles like "The Phantom Menace," Spielberg's own "A.I." or "Singin' in the Rain."<p>At times, the extras for "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" play like "E.T." the celebrity news show. Spielberg and his actors stay in pure promotion mode as they reminisce. The populist approach should suit fans looking to catch up with the "E.T." stars, but it probably won't sit well with those seeking insight into one of the last century's most successful movies.<p>Both sets feature the original theatrical version of "E.T." and the updated director's cut that was released to cinemas in March. Universal says Spielberg gave in to consumer demand at the last minute, agreeing to include the original film on the smaller set. This may explain some of the DVD sets' problems with clunky navigation and skimpy direct access of extras. Both sets include a second unspooling of the new film as it was accompanied live by John Williams' orchestra.<p>The "Limited Collector's Edition" has a half-hour version of the new making-of docu "The Evolution and Creation of E.T." that runs almost an hour on the larger set. Also missing is the larger set's thoughtful documentary on John Williams, who won an Oscar for his "E.T." score. These cuts removed some of the more informative material, making the full box set the necessary (and more costly) acquisition for those with a serious interest in the film. Both sets are to be discontinued at the end of the year, returning "E.T." to the suspended animation of "video moratorium."<p>"The Ultimate Gift Boxed Set" adds a remastered CD soundtrack, the colorful hardcover book "E.T. From Concept to Classic" (which threads Melissa Mathison's script around some decent feature material) and a "collectible senitype" (reproduction of a film frame). A certificate of authenticity makes it all official. The review copy's box suffered significant tearing at the corners not long after it was removed from the shrinkwrap. The smaller package is quite sturdy.<p>The new cut of "E.T." looks fine, much as it did during its theatrical run last spring. Image quality has its highs and a few lows, but this appears to be the best possible rendering of "E.T." The older film looks so-so, with night scenes on the muddy side.<p>The DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 sound strong for the most part, providing sufficient vistas for John Williams' sweeping score. The DTS provides more depth and bottom than the Dolby, but the difference won't be dramatic on most systems. In an oddity, the original "E.T." on the two-disc edition has DTS encoding, but not on the more extensive set (this is not reflected on the packaging). Universal says this was a disc-space issue. No matter -- the old sound can't touch the new sound regardless of how it's processed. Limited surround effects on the updated film won't test the outer limits of many systems: It all sounds kind of Pro Logic, probably a creative decision.<p>Buyers of the larger set get a breakdown of scenes that were changed or added, but you have to go deep into the making-of to find the comparisons. (Users should be able to access features like these quickly via menus).</p></body></html>

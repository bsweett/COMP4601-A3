The supporting cast of kids and adults in the film are great. Throw in some catchy rock tunes and a whole lot of zany situations and you've got one of the best comedies of the year. The original release on DVD has a very good transfer and some very cool extras including excellent commentaries which make for some interesting repeated viewings of the film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another brilliant documentary from Herzog..."></head><body><p>There are certain themes that never tire - such as man's humility in the face of nature.  Grizzly Man is such a story.  The ironic thing is that Timothy Treadwell thought that he was on the right side of that equation; arguing for the preservation of animals.  Yet, as you watch this fascinating documentary, you see Treadwell slipping into what can only be called madness.  I kept thinking of Captain Ahab as Treadwell yelled at the sky to rain.  He preferred the bear's world to man's world.  The problem was, he seemed to think that made him a bear.<br /><br />Yet, Treadwell is a likeable guy.  He's like a slightly nuttier version of the Crocodile Guy (if you can imagine such a thing).  You root for him, even though you know he will get eaten.  Yet, he knew the dangers he faced and he wouldn't have done anything differently had he known his fate.  Sane or insane, Grizzly Man is the story of a man who brought meaning to his life...even though his lifestyle eventually killed him.</p></body></html>

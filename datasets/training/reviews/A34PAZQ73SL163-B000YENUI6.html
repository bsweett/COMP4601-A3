<meta name="summary" content="Breathtaking."></head><body><p>Yeah, I know "breathtaking" is a bit of a clich&eacute; but Eastern Promises is the type of film that you can't stop watching once it begins to play. It's also a must see for anyone interested in the Russian mob. Here the concentration is on the London version of the mafiya although the vors have their tentacles stretched into numerous other cities and countries. Viggo Mortensen is exceptional as Nikolai who is only "a driver" in the laconic language of the mob. He is quite a bit more! The plot is very intricate but I will not give any of it away here. Suffice to say, however, that you will be extremely surprised by its ending. Steven Knight wrote this along "Dirty Pretty Things" which was riveting as well. The power of the 2002 release gave me an inkling that Eastern Promises would be as absorbing as it turned out to be.</p></body></html>

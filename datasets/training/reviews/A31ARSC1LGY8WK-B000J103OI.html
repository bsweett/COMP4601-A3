<meta name="summary" content="Meryl Streep nominated for Best Actress in this film - get real!"></head><body><p>"The Devil Wears Prada" is a slight comedy set within the world of high fashion.<br /><br />Meryl Streep plays the head of a fashion magazine and Anne Hathaway her new assistant. How Meryl Streep managed to get a Best Actress nomination for a role in this film beggars belief. Anne Hathaway is quite cute but somebody with a bit more spunk could have made more out of it e.g. Kirsten Dunst.<br /><br />The undemanding, inoffensive plot and the casting of Hathaway would lead one to believe the filmmakers were trying to appeal to the "Princess Bride" audience of Hathaway rather than the "adult" audience of Streep.<br /><br />Yet more formula entertainment from the Hollywood production line.</p></body></html>

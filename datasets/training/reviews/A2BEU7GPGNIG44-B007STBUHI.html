Why release a 30th anniversary edition of Jaws when there was a 25th anniversary edition? Okay, so there have been multiple releases but this release is the grand daddy of them all and fans of the classic shark tale will be pleased. The two disc set is Jaws overload and a must have for the classic film collector. Jaws was director Stephen Spielberg's first huge blockbuster movie. It was the first movie to hit the $100 million dollar mark. This was a big deal back in the mid 70's. The film spawned sequels and even a amusement park attraction at Universal Studios in the mid 80's. The film also did wonders for Martha's Vineyard's tourism industry.<br /><br />Okay...you know what the movie is about. Big scary shark terrorizes people, man says, "You're going to need a bigger boat," on to the extras. The best thing I like about the set is that it includes a full color booklet. Not a little mini book but a thick little black photo journal. The booklet includes pictures and details from the film. I like the book a lot. There are movie quotes and facts about the film in the book.<br /><br />The extras are what sets this release apart from previous releases. You have the choice between Dobly Digital 5.1, DTS 5.1 Aufio and Original Theatrical Mono Audio track. The set includes deleted scenes and out takes and a never before seen interview with director Stephen Spielberg. Disc 2 equally impressive. It includes a 2 hour documentary about the film. The documentary is amazing. Another feature on the disc is the Jaws Archive which includes production photo's, storyboards, and more. You will be ultra pleased with this purchase.</p></body></html>

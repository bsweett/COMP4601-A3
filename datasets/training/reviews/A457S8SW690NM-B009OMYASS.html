The trailers looked awesome and the reviews were very positive. So, I decided to watch this (instead of Munich!Doh!) with high expectations. I was expecting a movie like Saw. What I got was half American Pie/ soft porn and half good horror fun.<br />This movie is 1h35 min. long. The first 40 minutes flat out suck. Sure there were some hot babes, all naked, but I went to this movie to see a horror movie.<br />The plot centers around 3 friends traveling through Europe wanting to get stoned and find some hot babes. They find themselves in Amsterdam and have a little fun before some guy tells them to go to Slovakia to find the best girls. They find them, have fun and then things go horribly wrong. The only problem is tha it takes half of the movie to get there.<br />The opening sequence of the movie acts like we're going to be in for a great ride. Don't trust it.<br />For sure, they picked some gorgeous women to be in this movie. So for sure, they're some really nice women naked. But the problem is that I wanted to watch a horror movie not Euro Trip 2.<br />Once the movie kicks into gear, it's great. The ending is also great. One of the 3 friends manages to escape from a basement full of psychos and executes sweet revenge. Anf boy, the revenge is gory as hell!<br />The movie also is powerful. It had a very powerful message. These 3 friends are lokking for a good time but they end up in a very sick world. Kind of like 8mm but on a much larger scale. Sick, rich freaks pay other psychos to murder people in horrific ways. The best part and creepiest may I add is that everyone is connected. And once you get towards the end, you'll see that everything was set up and everyone was in on it. It's very disturbing and sad.<br />My recommendation is to rent it when it comes out on DVD. The first half isn't a horror movie, the last is. What a shame.<br />But the 2nd half will please for sure. While the movie isn't scary but flat out gory, the 2nd half is still good. And if you liked Saw, the 2nd half is a good appetizer while waiting for the 3rd one (if you saw it, you'll know what I mean).<br />So, Hostel is a powerful movie with a great second half filled with revenge at tis finest. The final sequence is great and gory and it will make you scream: kill that stupid piece of sh**! Kill him!<br />Hostel is dissapointing and I nearly left the theater. But thank goodness I didn't because the 2nd half is a true horror movie. Too bad the entire movie wasn't.<br />Now I know what Tarantino should do. He should take Uma Thurman (Beatrice Kiddow from Kill Bill) and throw her in this sick little torture place. That would make for great fun! Please mr. Tarantino, make my day, we want to see Uma kick more a#$!</p></body></html>

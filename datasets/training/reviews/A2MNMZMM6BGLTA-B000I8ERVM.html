I feel that the origional Exorcist was the most terrifying movie I have ever seen and knew that I shouldn't try to compare the two. This movie not only doesn't live up to William Peter Blattys first movie it doesn't live up to the third one Legion Exorcist III with George C. Scott. Not sure it was even as good as the horrible Heretic or the last two bombs that they did twice cause they stunk.<br /><br />Now to get to Emily Rose. I found this movie to be one thing that a movie based on an exorcism should at least try to be and that is scarey. It wasn't scarey in the least. Not one time. As a court room drama I thought it was boring and blah. If they were going to present this as a court room drama they could have just done that and not passed judgement or had all the hocus pocus mumbo jumbo and let you decide. But they try to make it realistic by having and showing a trial (which I guess did happen in Germany in the real story of a girl with Grand Maul Epileptic Siezures that a bunch of morons convinced themselves was demonic possession and pumped her full of drugs and her haulucinations along with the epilepsy convinced them that she didn't need medical care but a witch doctor priest and they let her starve to death and die of neglect).<br /><br />I thought Laura Linney was boring and Campbell Scott was so ineffective and boring that I didn't even record or recognize him simply cause I didn't care. The movie is just bad and ineffective at what it should be.</p></body></html>

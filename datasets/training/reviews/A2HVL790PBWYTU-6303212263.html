<meta name="summary" content="still up, up and away the best Superman film"></head><body><p>In my anxiety to see Superman Returns, I've been passing time by watching again every Superman movie and television series (live action and animated) that I can get my hands on. I went through the George Reeves series, the Lois & Clark and Superboy/Smallsville series and the cartoon Superman, Justice League and, God help me, even the 70's Superfriends shows. But I've saved for last the piece-de-resistance: the Christopher Reeve classics.<br /><br />I've genuinely forgotten how great and sweet the 1978 Superman film was, and is. A feeling of enchantment is launched in the air as "June 1938" flashes on the screen, then a boy leafs thru the pages of Action comics, the young lad's voiceover commenting on the Depression and the importance of truth-dealing newspapers such as the Daily Planet in so turbulent and troubled an era. Then, the immortal John Williams-crafted Superman theme song is heard and the adventure begins. True, I've always had to grind my teeth and wait out the sterile 25 minute opening. But once the film focuses on Planet Earth and the arrival of baby Kal-El, it's all so good. The segment of Clark's child- and teenhood is depicted in an almost pastoral manner, giving heft to scenes of Clark learning how truly special he is, and how he is ultimately alone. These bittersweet moments of lessons learned will shape the man that Clark will become. Then, the tragedy of his adopted father's death, leading eventually to Clark's discovery of the Fortress of Solitude and thus, his Kryptonian heritage. There is almost a sense of intermission at this point, wherein the viewer can take a breath, relax and prepare for the second half of the film. I think I'll start a new paragraph.<br /><br />Twelve years pass. Clark, now in his Superman guise, flies away from the Fortress of Solitude. The camera cuts next to a cabbie telling his passenger that he's arrived at the Daily Planet, and Clark Kent's new chapter begins. There, he meets Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen and Editor-in-Chief Perry White. Clark doesn't waste time setting up his bespectacled persona  of cluelessness and clumsiness in several nicely-paced sequences that had moments of sheer hilarity and screwballness. Next, Superman's nemesis shows up, the fiendishly clever and criminal Lex Luthor and things begin to get somewhat serious, though Luthor's wacky sidekicks intermittently interject an element of humor. Luthor's plan is diabolical and ably challenges Superman's abilities. But, in the end, all is well as the Man of Steel foils Luthor's scheme and sends him packing to the hoosegow; Superman has a fleeting romantic moment with Lois. End of film.<br /><br />Christopher Reeve. Christopher Reeve. Christopher Reeve. Despite the all-star cast, Christopher Reeve makes the movie. He inhabits Superman as if he were his favorite pajamas, instilling in his iconic superhero that perfect blend of confidence, steely resolve and gentlemanly decorum. On the other hand, he infuses his Clark Kent with the proper amount of  "aw, shucks" country bumpkin and slouching mild mannerisms. A perfect portrayal. Christopher Reeve was born to be Superman. The reaction of the crowd upon Supe's first public appearance is still thrilling to witness. Lois Lane's freaked-out "You've got me?! But, who's got you?" is still a classic line. Margot Kidder is delicious as reporter Lois Lane:  nosy, plucky and in-your-face. She melts perfectly for Superman and routinely snubs Clark Kent. Go check out the screen test in the special features to see how much better Margot is, compared to the other actresses that went for the role. Gene Hackman plays Luthor more comically than I would've expected but, what the hell, it works. The best I can say of Marlon Brando as Jor-El is that his distinctive voice is used in the trailer of Superman Returns.<br /><br />The special effects, for their time, are wonderfully innovative and wow-inducing. The only effect that doesn't look convincing is the sequence where teenage Clark outruns a train. Everything else, perfection.<br /><br />The special features are pretty sweet: Side A contains an insightful commentary by director Richard Donner; 10 added scenes including a young Lois with her parents on a train and a scene with Jor-El and Superman; some "Superman - The Legacy" fun facts; and a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />Side B contains: three documentaries ("Taking Flight: the Development of Superman", "Making Superman: Filming the Legend" and "The Magic Behind the Cape"); deleted scenes; screen tests of Superman (Reeve with sweaty pits!), Lois Lane (with actresses Anne Archer, Lesley Ann Warren, Margot Kidder and Stockard Channing) and Ursa, the Kryptonian supervillainess in the sequel; a teaser trailer; and a TV spot.<br /><br />This is a classic film, full of matinee fun and movie magic. It certainly has stood the test of time. Despite the fact that I can't wait to see Superman Returns, I doubt it could live up to Superman 1 or 2. Speaking of which, I think I'll pop in the sequel now.</p></body></html>

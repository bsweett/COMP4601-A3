The first I hear of this movie was an internet promo with the very cleaned up audio from BLACK SABBATH's song the same title, and  some basic visuals. And so, I waited until the film came along, but due to circumstances beyond my control I could not get to the theatre to see it, and wow did I want to see it in the Cinema.<br />Anyways, the film is just totally fiery from start to surprise finish. After reading Ironman in the 70s, he has appeared as everything I wanted. The re-writes in recent years will no doubt try to cheat me of that from what I can gather, but this is something that a long term fan can really get into.<br />The DVD even has some really cool, IPOD style interfaces. The Computers that Stark uses are just ultra cool, and the virtual generation gear is amazing.<br />For the first time ever, I totally agree with all the deletes they made on the movie. This one has no commentary, unfortunately, and I think that they could have done one quite easily for total entertainment value.The Ironman Suits from the basic, made from Necessity, to the ones done through Technology, all have the iconic Ironman Appeal.This is one DVD where only the double set will suffice. The extras tell the story that the commentary does not.John Favreau has crafted another piece together with a team of people who each do their own superb thing. It was also great to see a bit of video of Stan Winston, even though it was his studio and not him, himself who did the work. The Cover is very cool too, since the outer cardboard image comes off to reveal the man underneath, truly a well thought out package.</p></body></html>

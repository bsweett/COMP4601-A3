Pitt and Jolie star as an unhappily married couple who soon discover that each other are assassins working for rival organizations, and each one has the other set in their sights.  Yeah, you all pretty much know the premise by now, so there's no need to go any further in that department.  What really sets Mr. & Mrs. Smith apart from other mega budget fodder is the energetic and sometimes electrifying direction from Doug Liman (Go, The Bourne Identity) and the heat and chemistry demonstrated by Pitt and Jolie, but there's really nothing else here to make it anything real special.  Also featuring the always scene stealing Vince Vaughan and Adam Brody.</p></body></html>

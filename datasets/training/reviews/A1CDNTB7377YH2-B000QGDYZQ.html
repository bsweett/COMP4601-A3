<meta name="summary" content="Not Quite as Good As Deja Vu"></head><body><p>This movie came out about the same time as another film called Deja Vu.  Both films dealt with time travel to some degree and centered around preventing a death.  This movie doesn't quite measure up to the other film.<br /><br />It takes place over a week, however the days occur out of sequence.  Sandra Bullock goes to sleep with a seemingly happy family of two girls and a husband.  She wakes up to find that her husband died during an out of town trip that she doesn't remember.  She then goes to sleep and wakes up to find that her husband is still alive and the days seem to be out of sequence.  Her husband's death apparently occurred on Wednesday and each time Bullock awakes it is first a day later in the week from Wednesday then a day earlier in the week than Wednesday.<br /><br />When Bullock starts piecing together what is going on with her, she has to decide if she wants to do nothing to prevent her husband from dieing or let things take her course (she learns that he may have been cheating on her).<br /><br />When all is resolved, the viewer is shaking their head, specifically at Bullocks non-attempt to alter even the smallest thing (she finds a torn out page from the Yellow Pages in a trash can and when she goes back in time she realizes that she is throwing the same page into the trash can.  She could have done a little nuance to change things by removing the paper from the trash).  The very last scene of the movie made very little sense to me and I felt that I had wasted two hours watching this mismash.  See Deja Vu instead!</p></body></html>

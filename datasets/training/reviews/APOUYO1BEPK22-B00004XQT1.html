He works for his fathers company, even though he doesn't really have to. He compares business cards with fellow friends and makes reservations at the newest and hottest restaurants... just because. He has a body every man wants and every girl wants to touch. He's meticulous and anal in everything he does. He's also a homicidal maniac. He kills for fun and he kills for release and he kills for hatred. After one of his murders though, a homicide cop begins too get a little too close for comfort of figuring out that Patrick could be the killer and Patrick begins to unravel from his calm demeanor.<br /><br />Never having read the book the movie is based on; I went into this movie blind. And loved it. It was a lot of fun to listen to his Patrick's narration of who he is and what he is. Like when he's talking about his facial mask. As he begins to peel it off after 10 minutes of having it on, you really just cant help see him telling us that what is on his outside is not who he is on the inside. He's not your friend. Not your coworker. Not your lover. He's a friggin soulless killer. It is crazy to think that someone could be so cold and emotionless, but yet there are people out there that are like that. I don't believe for a second that he got 100% pleasure out of all of his kills. Some seemed like he just couldn't help it. Like we might go get a massage, have sex, or just sit on the beach for some relaxation. He would kill.<br /><br />Not only is the movie just crazy good, it's also pretty funny. Dark funny though. Seeing him get massively pissed off over someone's business cards is too funny. And not in the ha-ha kind of funny way, but in the `holy crap he's getting pissed over nothing' kind of way. And flexing in the mirror while having sex with two girls? Legendary. And chasing someone down a hallway, butt nekid except for high tops, and a chainsaw? Once again... Legendary. And when he says things out loud such as "I'm into murders and executions" and someone doesn't really hear him and thinks he says `mergers and acquisitions'...that's just funny. There are just a lot of funny lines in this movie, but dark funny guys. I love how he tells people he will kill them, but you know he means it...lol.<br /><br />Christian Bale is a pretty good actor for sure. I love how he seems different in all his parts he plays. Not a lot different, but he just is. It's almost subtle, but he's not really ever the same. But one thing for sure is that good gracious God blessed that man with a crazy metabolism or something. I'm not gay, but the man has a great body. And to do what he does with it is crazy. I'll never forget the way he looked like a dang holocaust victim in The Mechanist and then like a few months later he was Batman or something. Crazy.<br /><br />P.S. - So I'm not afraid to say I don't understand the ending. I can't tell what was going on at the end. Is he a killer for real...or is it in his head? For instance...he blew up a cop car with a pistol. Even he looked at his gun like `wtf?' And then after his confession, even his lawyer said he was kidding around. Was he? Or was the lawyer covering for him? I was confused. Anyone want to help me out? I tried not to say much, so spoilers ahead if there needs to be in the comments!</p></body></html>

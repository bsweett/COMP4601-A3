<meta name="summary" content="Thoroughly disappointing animated film"></head><body><p>Remember when we only got a few animated films every couple years? That's back when the producers of an animated film would take their time in developing a story, characters, and well-presented theme. Now, you just throw together as many "name" actors as you can, hire a group of animators and force out a story.<br /><br />And from this new animation environment comes such dreadfully dull and pointless cartoons as Happy Feet. The first 30 minutes looks like an animated remake of March of the Penguins. While the imagery is beautiful, it looked better in real life. A bunch of 80s pop songs are thrown together to tie in the idea that every penguin has a "heartsong". Unfortunately, the covers of these songs are lackluster and really should have been replaced with original material.<br /><br />So, a new penguin is hatched after being dropped by has father onto the cold ice, which we all learned from March of the Penguins, means instant death for the egg. So, this baby doesn't die, he just can't sing and wants to dance all the time. For this he is banished from the land of the penguins, because it's just "un-penguinlike" to dance around.<br /><br />Around the 45 minute mark is where Robin Williams comes in and actually adds life to the slowly sinking ship that is Happy Feet. But one man can only do so much, even if he is voicing multiple characters.<br /><br />Some kind of grand theme clearly depicting the lead penguin as a kind of restrictive religious leader results. Mumbles, the dancing penguin I mentioned earlier who's the main character embarks on a journey to find the "aliens" who are "stealing their fish". By this he means human fishermen of course.<br /><br />The last five to ten minutes becomes almost nonsensical, even for environmentalists who agree with the message that is being pushed onto viewers.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is not worth viewing at all. It's worth avoiding. The voice talent, apart from Robin Williams, is dismal. Nicole Kidman, Brittany Murphy... hearing their voices come out of penguins is not interesting or creative. The music is incredibly poorly done. When one of the main themes of the movie is music and "heartsongs", you could at least expect some decent musical numbers or original tunes. Not here. The story is borderline senseless, and the environmentalist theme is slammed down much to forcefully and ineffectively.<br /><br />But you know what? The animation is actually awesome. I can see why it got released in IMAX theatres because there are some incredible visual effects. They're just too far apart to save the film. And the visual stimulation doesn't keep 95 minutes of boring plot from being boring.</p></body></html>

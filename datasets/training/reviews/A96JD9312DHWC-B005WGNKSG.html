<meta name="summary" content="The Girl with the Dark Past"></head><body><p>This is one of those movies that sucks you in and won't let you go. Whether you has a need to see something violent or you want to feel something or you just need a puzzle to try and solve, this movie had it all.<br />Everything was growing through the cinematic pavement.<br /><br />When I first sat down to watch Girl with, I did my best not to know anything about it. And, really, that helped me out a lot. I went in expecting nothing and I got what seemed like a classic movie that had me from the beginning. You waltz into an investigation that is being carried out about a mising persons case that happened over 40 years old, and the blocks start to stack from there. You have the collision of differing storylines, really great acting, some really dark moments, and a puzzle that is addictive.<br /><br />As one of the characters remarks in the movie, "you are already addicted, aren't you," talking about the case. And, indeed, I was. I kept looking at the pieces and trying to solve this movie, wanting sooo much to find the meaning in every fiber laying in front of me. To me, that is the sign of a great movie - the sexiness hidden inside the chase and the shock when everything falls into place - this movie has that and more.<br /><br />Five plus stars - and don't be one of thos epeople who throws something out because it is foreign and you have to "read it." Watch it three times - read once, watch once, combine tactics. Just don't miss out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Incredible Hulk, With a Face That's Mean . . ."></head><body><p>. . . Lots of muscles<br /><br />  And skin that's green<br /><br />  You can make him with Play-Dough!!!<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk is an incredible butt-cramper of a movie.  You kind of wish you had him around to work out the kinks in your back from sitting so long.<br /><br />The movie took itself WAY too seriously for a comic-book film.  The special effects Hulk looks amusing rather than scary.  His powers are preposterous.  He leaps and flies through the Grand Canyon like an eagle, even though he weighs about a ton.  He battles the military in the air and sky, under tremendous stress, but never eating a bite of food for fuel.  He splits his shirt, but his purple shorts miraculously contract and expand with him.  It was all I could do not to bust out laughing.<br /><br />Nick Nolte is very good as Bruce Banner's megalomaniac father who wants his son's powers for himself.  He alone makes this movie good for a one-time rental ONLY.</p></body></html>

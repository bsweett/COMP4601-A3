<meta name="summary" content="What the ...........  ?"></head><body><p>Take a top notch director, several Academy Award winning actors, a script from the discard bin at the SyFy channel and a couple hundred million dollars - and this is what you get.<br /><br />THIS MOVIE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE!<br /><br />There is no logical motivation for the basis of the storyline.  It's all a bunch of nonsense that provides no purpose.<br /><br />The previews of this film with its horrifying soundtrack made this film look like the must-see film of the year! Too bad the previews were the best thing about this film.<br /><br />Oh I can see where the money was spent - it's a big involved production and they've got some really great talent wondering what the heck they're doing in this lousy film.  I'm sure the producers had to pay the actors more when the actors realized what a horrible film this was.<br /><br />Why is Charlize Theron - arguably one of the most beautiful women in the world - and an incredible actress - ....why is she only delivering a flat "angry" performance? No range. Terrible.<br /><br />Guy Pearce - why bother hiring this fine actor if you're going to cover him up in some of the poorest old age make-up I've seen this side of a high school play?  He's completely wasted - but then so is the whole storyline involving him.<br /><br />Is there any reason that "humanoid" beings populated the Earth and finding them so Pearce's character can find immortality?<br /><br />The plot line is paper thin and very juvenile compared to the original Alien and its first sequel Aliens. The characters are so poorly drawn that you really don't care whether anyone lives or dies.  When they do start dying, I began rooting for the aliens because the humans were all so pathetic and uninteresting.<br /><br />If we don't know who these humanoid beings are, then why in the "universe" would we assume that they can grant immortality?  Where's the logic?<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />And what the heck is that humanoid drinking at the beginning of the film, why is he doing it and why is he alone and what in the world does it have to do with anything?<br /><br />This film would have been ever so much better if they'd just maintained the original premise of the film and allowed the crashed ship to have been another alien race that had succumbed to the Aliens.<br /><br />WOW - what a stinker!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Difficult to follow"></head><body><p>This is the type of movie that you need to see on DVD instead of the theater because it is hard to follow and you may need to re-watch earlier scenes several times to understand everything.<br /><br />The beginning scene is pretty hard to watch because two guys are slaughtered by some kids.  You know that somehow this scene will have a bearing on the movie.  The next scene shifts to the UN and Silvia (Nicole Kidman), is working as an interpreter during a session.  There is an issue with one of the metal detectors not functioning so the security force shuts down the building until they can check that nothing has been snuck in (of course something was snuck in but we will only find out at the end).  For some strange reason Silvia needs to stay late (apparently to retrieve her flute) and hears a conversation in the seemingly empty conference hall.  Surprisingly it is in an African language which just happens to be her native tongue.  It implies an assassination attempt on the heard of her country (How does a woman with an Austrailian accent happen to be a native African?).<br /><br />Sean Penn portraying a secret service agent is called in to investigate and initially does not believe Silvia.  As the story goes on we now that Penn is saddened by the recent death of his wife and Silvia, by the slaughter of her family in Africa.  Everything in this movie is not what it seems to be and anyone that might have seen The Manchurian Candidate can later figure out what will happen.<br /><br />I found this movie very slow and disappointing.</p></body></html>

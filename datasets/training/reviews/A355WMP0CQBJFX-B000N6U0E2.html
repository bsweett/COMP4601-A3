<meta name="summary" content="JUST ANOTHER REASON WILL SMITH IS AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME!!"></head><body><p>this film was a reflection of a man's dilemmas in real life. will smith, the wonderful actor that he is, really captured this mans tragedy, his suffering, his will to fight, to achieve what others thought impossible. he gave you that feeling that almost anything can be done. will smith is brilliant, the man is an A+. he put such feeling and emotions into the film that you really felt for him. and his son jaden might just take after his father. nice job. overall this movie was nicely done. there was a lesson to be learned, a life to portray, and so many things to deal with. basically how the average person is living. paycheck to paycheck all the same worries, the rent, the bills, and having to struggle. he was the man and he had to do something. he had to fix the problem, and although it took risk, fight, and everything he had, along side his son he made it happen. it wasn't easy, but nothing ever is that's worth fighting for. great movie, no doubt.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the funniest parodies in the history of the movies"></head><body><p>YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN could well be the finest comic parody of a serious film ever made.  James Whale, whose dedication to German expressionist aesthetic ideals Brooks and Wilder emulated in this film, directed both the original FRANKENSTEIN and its even finer sequel THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.  Gene Wilder had had the idea of doing a respectful parody of the Whale classics before he made BLAZING SADDLES and he approached Brooks with the idea of directing his script.  Most people I have asked about the film assume it is a Mel Brooks project from beginning to end, but it would be more accurate to describe it as Mel Brooks directing a Gene Wilder.  Of course, being Mel Brooks, he made more than his fair share of additions to the script, including many of the jokes, such as the famous Gene Wilder line "What great knockers!" he looks at the great doors of the mansion while his face is extremely close to Inga's chest.<br /><br />The film is such a successful collaboration that the film represents the career highpoint or close to it for several of the principals in the film.  Although BLAZING SADDLES has to go down as Brooks's career peak since he wrote, directed, and acted in it, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is his next greatest film.  Gene Wilder has never come close to having a greater role than that of Dr. Frederick Frankenstein and though he has written other screenplays, nothing else remotely approaches this in terms of success.  Though we know the late, great Peter Boyle for other roles (such as his great Emmy-winning performance on THE X-FILES' episode "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose"), this had to be his finest hour.  Teri Garr is one of my favorite actresses, but this is always been her best role in my opinion (it is also the role that changed her from primarily a TV guest actress to a movie actress).  Though Cloris Leachman has had an amazingly diverse and varied career, this is easily one of her most memorable roles.  Finally, Madeleine Kahn had comparable roles in BLAZING SADDLES and WHAT'S UP DOC?, but she was never clearly better than she was in this film.  The one clear exception to all this is Gene Hackman, who has a small cameo and who has had, of course, a few dozen better roles than this.  His presence is welcome all the same.  In short, it is a film that made everyone in the project look very good indeed.  One additional actor I would like to mention is Richard Haydn, a great veteran Hollywood character actor.  Many will recall him as one of the scholars in BALL OF FIRE, Howard Hawks's take off on SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS.  Here he appears at the very beginning of the film as Gerhard Falkstein.<br /><br />This is probably the last film Mel Brooks made in which very nearly every joke works.  What is remarkable is that they work as well today as they did in 1974 when the film first came out.  I suspect people will be laughing at it as hard 75 years from now as they do today.  The film has as many truly funny moments as any you could hope to see.  A host of the bits in the film have become classics, from Inga asking if Frederick would like to go for a "roll in ze hay" (she is being literal, not suggestive), to the horses neighing when they hear the name "Frau Bl&uuml;cher," to the famous performance by Gene Wilder and Peter Boyle of "Puttin' on the Ritz." But the jokes can obscure what a slick production it is. Most people know that they used much of the equipment used in the original James Whale films, but even when they using completely original items the film does a masterful job of imitating the look of the old Universal projects.<br /><br />In short, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is almost certainly assured of permanent status as a great comedy classic.  Having said that, I'm not certain that this great film has ever gotten the treatment that it has deserved on DVD.  I would love to see a definitive edition, with greatly expanded extras, better commentaries, interviews with the surviving cast members, and perhaps a documentary or two.  With most of the major surviving figures from the film either aging or ill, I would like to see this done sooner rather than later.  But even if this is the best we will ever get, this is definitely one of the classic comic films.</p></body></html>

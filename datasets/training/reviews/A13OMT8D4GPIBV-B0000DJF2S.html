<meta name="summary" content="Delightful Movie"></head><body><p>This is a delight to watch, although nowhere near as good as expected.  It features the likeness of a number of comic characters.<br /><br />The DVD features two commentary tracks, one with the producers and actors, and a second with the visual effects team.  It also includes a "Making Of" documentary, and number (12) of deleted scenes.  A good movie despite my feeling that it could've been better.<br /><br />It gets a solid recommendation.</p></body></html>

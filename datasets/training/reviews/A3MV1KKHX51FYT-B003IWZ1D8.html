<meta name="summary" content="A Shocking Horror Story"></head><body><p>The film begins in stark black and white, the frantic music is a clue to the story. In Phoenix Arizona Marion Crane has a long lunch hour with her boyfriend Sam. Sam has an ex-wife and financial problems. You can see a man standing in the street when Marion returns to her job in an office. Can drugs or money buy happiness? Customer Tom tells about himself. Marion must deposit $40,000 into the bank. [That would be over ten years' wages for Marion.] Will she go for a vacation? People could sleep in their cars then. Who is watching Marion? [Note the product placement in automobile brands.] A voice-over carries the story forward. After a long tiring drive she stops at a small motel. [Is the rain symbolic?]<br /><br />Is motel manager Norman Bates a nice young man? What about his mother? "She isn't quite herself today." Norman's hobby is taxidermy, the preservation of the dead (like a mummy). "She's as harmless as one of those stuffed birds." Does this talk pad out the film or lull the viewer before an action scene? Marion takes a shower to wash away her caress. But someone else is there! The attack is done with taste. [That eye is not dilated.] Now Norman has another mess to clean up and dispose of the leftovers.<br /><br />Marion's sister Lila visits Sam to inquire about her. So does a private investigator to locate the missing money. Arbogast visits hotels to search for a backtrail. One of these places is the Bates Motel. Arbogast recognizes Marion's signature, and then Norman remembers the details. Arbogast decides to go back and question Norman's mother. What a surprise! Then Sam returns to search for Arbogast. Sam and Lila visit Sheriff Chambers, who tells them about the history of Mrs. Bates. Who else was in the house?<br /><br />Sam and Lila return to investigate the Bates. Did Arbogast leave after learning something? Lila slips out to see Mrs, Bates. Her elaborately decorated bedroom is empty. Norman guesses their scheme and returns to the big house. The good guys win in the end. A psychiatrist provides details to explain this story. Were there other missing persons? Does the ending now seem to be unintentionally funny?<br /><br />This is a low-budget film with few actors. The story made this successful in the late 1950s. Note how Marion wears white underwear before the theft but black underwear afterwards. She was punished for her sins like in a morality play. The novel by Robert Bloch was inspired by a true crime in 1956 Wisconsin. The new highway damaged business for the Bates Motel, a reflection of the declining small businesses of the 1950s. The few outdoor scenes show southern California without traffic or smog.</p></body></html>

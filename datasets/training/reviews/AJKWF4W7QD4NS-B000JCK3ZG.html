<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly good"></head><body><p>With Bryan Singer and his writing team moving on to the Superman franchise, Marvel and Fox scrambled to get the third, and for now final, X-Men film out as quick as possible, with director Brett Ratner getting to direct the installment.  Now make no mistake, Ratner is a hack director at best, and his best talents are displayed in the many action scenes throughout the film, many of which are nicely done.  The story picks up a while after X2, with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Halle Berry) training a young group of mutants including Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Rogue (Anna Paquin), Shadowcat (Ellen Paige), and Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) while Cyclops (James Marsden) is still mourning the death of Jean (Famke Janssen).  In the meantime, a cure for mutants is announced, prompting Magneto (Ian McKellen) to organize his Brotherhood as Jean returns from the dead to make short work of Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and anyone else in her way.  For the most part, X-Men: The Last Stand is solid enough to stand out on it's own, but it really misses the touch that Singer and his crew had on the characters.  The dark tone is still here, but the characterization injected in the previous two films gets the second tier treatment here.  Many characters, mainly Cyclops and Rogue, are almost completely ignored to make way for new characters like Beast (Kelsey Grammer, perfectly cast) and Angel (Ben Foster, who plays a much lesser role than you would think), while new villains are introduced including Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones, yes, Vinnie Jones in a fake looking muscle suit and all) and Multiple Man (Eric Dane), while Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) get a backseat.  There's loads of in-references that longtime X-fans will get (the Days of Futures Past nod is a nice touch, and Stan Lee and Chris Claremont make cameos), but to believe that this is the last X-Men film is just silly.  It could have been better (and longer, the film is over way too quick), but it could have been a lot worse too, so maybe we should count our blessings.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Give me a little space!"></head><body><p>This film is such an accurate satire of today's enclosed corporate environment that it's almost surreal.  It was recommended to me by a couple of colleagues @ work and now I well understand why.  All of the usual office politics, personnel clashes, annoying bureaucracy, ever-present red tape, silly rules / policies and the fixation of management on meaningless matters.<br /><br />While watching this movie I sometimes almost felt like I was AT work myself.  A few of the incidents brought back vivid memories of instances that I've experienced.  I'm sure that most people who work in an office will find a whole lot in this story that they can relate to, just as I did.<br /><br />The one big name in the cast is Jennifer Anniston (big hair and all!) who portrays a fed-up waitress.  She doesn't have too many lines but she is the one bona-fide celebrity who appears on the screen.  I don't recall seeing any of the other actors in anything else.<br /><br />If you're a white color worker (and perhaps even if you're not a white color worker) then this film is certainly worth a look.  I would especially recommend it to persons in management as they just MIGHT understand how foolish they look in front of the working bees whenever they make stupid decisions.  Yes, for management types this flick might be VERY humbling indeed.</p></body></html>

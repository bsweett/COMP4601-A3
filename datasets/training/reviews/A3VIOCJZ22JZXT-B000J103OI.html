Primarily this means how to balance work demands and the demands of family and friends. I personally think that the years following college graduation and the first successes and failures in business help a young adult clarify their values and the path or direction they wish to take their life. In this regard, The Devil Wears Prada, is right on the money.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway does a great job playing recent college graduate, Andrea, who takes a job as second assistant to a highly demanding supervisor. Meryl Streep, as editor Miranda Priestly, does a superb job of playing a driven, workaholic, creative power-broker in the fashion industry. Strep's performance was captivating yet not 'over the top'. She never was a cartoon witch, just incredibly demanding and self absorbed. The fact that Meryl Streep can take a character that is totally unique and bring out the vulnerable human qualities attests to her superior acting skills. Watching Streep play the Machiavellian diva is worth the price of the DVD.<br /><br />So what happens to little innocent Andrea? She gradually takes the challenge of trying to please the totally unpleasable Miranda. She gradually masters her job and the field of fashion. She also gradually begins to edge out first assistant, Emily Blunt. Blunt is also superb as she trys to imitate her hateful boss, yet always a softer side comes through. Handsome Daniel Sunjata plays a young designer, dependent on Miranda's good graces and opionion. He is willing to change an entire line of his designs to please her.<br /><br />Simon Baker as a jet set journalist, Stanley Tucci as Miranda's second in command, and Adrian Grenier as Anne's college boy friend, Nate, all allow Andrea to see herself as other see her and as she is gradually becoming. Andrea is almost lost, until she discovers that Miranda's position is in jeapardy, and she comes to the loyal defense of a woman most folks consider to be a monster. But Miranda was already aware of the coup, and is willing to double cross her second in command to remain in power. Andrea gets a glimps into the driven inside dynamics of Miranda and at some point realizes she doesn't want this future - even if she may have the instict and brains for such a world. In the end, Andrea makes the right moves, she does not fall for the chaos and competition, and gets her life and love back.<br /><br />You will remain entertained by the beautiful cast, Hathaway and Streep's superb performances, and the stunning designer clothes Hathaway shows us throughout the second half of the film.</p></body></html>

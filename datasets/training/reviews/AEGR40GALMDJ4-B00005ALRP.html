The action is non stop and the tenstion of the &quot;who dunnit&quot; question is always hanging in the air.  The plot is one of the most heartpounding and thrilling I have ever watched.  The cinematography is really shot well.  The villain comes out of nowhere, and even the keenest mind will be surprised when you figure it out.  Julianne Moore makes a breakthrough role as the suspicious doctor in the hospital scene.  This film in a sense reminds me of the old cop TV series, because you are always wondering if Harrison Ford can ger out of the predicament he is in.  I highly reccomend this film for any action buff.</p></body></html>

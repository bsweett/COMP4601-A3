<meta name="summary" content="Jack Keeps Climbing the Beanstalk"></head><body><p>Jack Nicholson is a national treasure: those erratic, errant eyebrows, that rubbery face, those quick mood shifts, his overall nuttiness. In this film he's a screwball obsessive-compulsive who hates everyone except his waitress, Helen Hunt. They barely tolerate each other. This misanthrope hates his gay neighbor Greg Kinnear and the guy's little pooch who nearly steals the movie. Jack drops the dog in the garbage shoot of their apartment building.<br /> Jack mugs, sulks, gloats, and turns his face into a myriad of reactions. He has plenty of money so he is able to manipulate people. When Kinnear gets badly beaten up, Jack ends up taking care of the mutt which is the beginning of his conversion. It is the story of how he rejoins the human race by helping out Helen and Greg who infuse humanity into this creep.<br /> It's a movie with a lot of laughs brought on by one of the biggest hams in the business. This flick, without him, let's say with Robin Williams, could have turned into a saccharine, schmaltzy, gooey mess. Jack is a comedic master, but one sometimes wonders where Jack leaves off, and the role he is playing begins. Is he always just playing Jack? Maybe kookiness isn't that much of a stretch for him.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nautical Epic Of War and Family"></head><body><p>&quot;Master And Commander&quot; is a masterpiece of a film.  It shows an accurate description of Napoleonic-era nautical warfare, as well as the bonds shared between a group of men on the sea.  Russell Crowe plays Captain &quot;Lucky&quot; Jack Aubrey, leader of the HMS Surprise.  Paul Bettany plays the ship's doctor/Aubrey's confidant.  The entire cast does an outstanding job.<p>The story begins with an attack on the Surprise by the Acheron, a French warship that Aubrey is hunting.  The rest of the film plays out with Aubrey setting out on a quest to outwit and defeat the Acheron, a ship that is armed with more guns, more men, and a captain that even Aubrey is respectful of.  Along the way, we see Aubrey's softer side, his human side, that usually isn't portrayed in a character of his magnitude and position.  We are shown the bonds of brotherhood that keep the crew together through good times and bad.  We also see how life on a warship can swiftly change from boredom to life-and-death situations, as well as discipline carried out by ranking officials.<p>Overall, I've yet to see a film that reveals so much action, so many emotions, and so much reality into two-and-a-half hour production.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

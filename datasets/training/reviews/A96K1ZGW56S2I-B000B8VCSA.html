<meta name="summary" content="Meanwhile Back in Berlin."></head><body><p>THE BOURNE SUPREMACY begins two years after THE BOURNE IDENTITY left off. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) has been quietly living in Goa, India with girlfriend Marie. He still suffers from amnesia and can't remember much about his past except for snippets that come to him in dreams. He writes these things down in a journal trying to piece together his forgotten and shattered past.  Meanwhile, back in Berlin, an expensive and important CIA operation is blotched when some important files are stolen and a key informant is killed. The killer "leaves" a fingerprint behind and the print turns out to belong to Jason Bourne.  This leads Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) to begin a worldwide search for Bourne to bring him in for questioning. Back in India, Jason and Marie plan their get away from a Russian hitman, but things turn tragic. Two years ago Bourne told the CIA to leave him alone. He thinks they're after him again and he begins a mission to show the intelligent agency just who really is supreme.<br /><br />THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is a worthy sequel to the original THE BOURNE IDENTITY. The movie continues the story and as the film develops, we learn more not only about Bourne's past, but about other characters from the original film, too. The acting is extremely well done, especially for an action/espionage movie. Especially noteworthy is Matt Damon who portrays Bourne perfectly. One of the tag lines for the film "Matt Damon is Jason Bourne" isn't just a cool saying.<br /><br />The only major negative I found with the movie was quick cuts from one scene to another. I don't know why this has become the popular thing to do with fighting movies nowadays, but instead of making a film or movie more interesting, it proves to be a big distraction.  It leaves the audience wondering exactly what went on and unless it's a thinking movie, you should never leave an audience wondering what went happened. But other than that, it's all good.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Swans' Way"></head><body><p>We went expecting the absolute worst, having been fully briefed ahead of time about the film's misogyny and the plain blank ridiculousness of its plot and its various setups.<br /><br />All ballet movies are somewhat silly, though this one makes something like CENTER STAGE seem like a hard-hitting documentary; and yet I wouldn't hesitate to recommend BLACK SWAN even to Moira Shearer herself if she rose up from her grave and asked what was playing at the movies.  It has something, perhaps the tremendous conviction of the director and his lead actress, that makes its watchable at all times, even when the sheer level of camp rises to over your head, which is often believe me.  Someone said that Natalie Portman, as Nina Sayers, wears one expression on her face through the whole movie--that's not quite true, but BS veterans will know which expression my catty friend was speaking of.  She is extraordinarily disciplined in the part, and it looks crazy difficult, so I predict that she will get the award for this, that Catherine Deneuve should have gotten for REPULSION, the movie this mimics in many ways.  Some have compared BS to SHOWGIRLS, except while that Gina Gershon is miles better than Mila Kunis at playing the sensual, careless rival, Portman seems really to believe in Nina in a way that Elizabeth Berkley always seemed too timid too really go there.  Plus, the costumes and the hair and the makeup (in BS) are all astonishing, probably as good as the ones in the original RED SHOES.<br /><br />The problem with BLACK SWAN, finally, is that the cards seem stacked from the beginning against poor Nina.  She has nothing from the beginning of the movie, and never gets anything (except briefly, she gets to replace Beth MacIntyre)--(and Winona Ryder makes sure Nina never gets to enjoy a moment of that victory).  She has no men, no friends, no fun, a horrible mother and a lousy life.  She has Portman's beauty and grace, but not 15 minutes into the picture she has that rash on her back where it almost seems wings are going to grow.  The movie makes sure that Nina suffers with an almost obscene glory.  In casting Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder as look-alike avatars for Nina, Aronofsky insures that we will (perhaps subconsciously) pity Portman for her present-day good looks, so like Audrey Hepburn's in some shots), because we see what happened to Hershey and Ryder and conclude that time eats away at beauty just like the garbage can opening up its yawning mouth to accept the whole giant cake Hershey orders for Portman in the film's cruelest scene.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A single day in South Central . . ."></head><body><p>The premiere for this movie had to be postponed due to 9/11. That might have helped, as it did very well in the box office. But still, the horrors of 9/11 gave the film a near-total eclipse. But thanks to strong DVD sales later in the years, it finally gets the recognition it deserves. This is one of Denzel Washington's most memorable performances yet. I'd say his performance in "Malcolm X" is the finest, but here he gets 2nd place as a Los Angeles detective whose mind is more twisted than most. Ethan Hawke is the LAPD police officer who is being evaluated by Denzel; he gives a spectacular performance as well. It's a shame he didn't win an Oscar for it. The supporting cast (Eva Mendes, Tom Berenger, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, etc.) also do very well in the film. The portrayal of the infamous "South Central" may look a bit exaggerated, but it sure looks real to me.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></body></html>

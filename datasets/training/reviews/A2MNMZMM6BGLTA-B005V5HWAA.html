<meta name="summary" content="Not Bad"></head><body><p>I thought this movie was pretty entertaining. Costner finally finds a good movie to star in. I was skeptical of Dane Cook being in this but he does a good job and is perfect for his part. William Hurt is also very good as Mr. Brooks bad angel. I thought Demi Moore was ok but to be honest I thought that her entire part could have been left out though I think they were going with her bing the Clarice Starling to Costners Lechter.<br /><br />I recommend it. It was creepy, smart and had some pretty funny things in it to break up the tension.</p></body></html>

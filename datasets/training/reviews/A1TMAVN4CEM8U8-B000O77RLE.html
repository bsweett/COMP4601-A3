<meta name="summary" content="Too bad the Japanese General was so competent"></head><body><p>Letters From Iwo Jima  DVD<br /><br />Letters From Iwo is a companion piece to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77QDI">Flags of Our Fathers (Two-Disc Special Edition) [HD DVD</a>], both directed by Clint Eastwood, both about the circumstances surrounding the battle for Iwo Jima.  This movie is told from the Japanese point of view.<br /><br />If the movie is true, unfortunately the Japanese general was competent, when he first arrived, he got off his plane and walked the terrain, he did not just go into the operations center and look at maps.<br /><br />He then completely scrapped the defensive plan.  Moved the revetments so that the machine guns had enfilading fire. Moved the artillery back to the military crest on the mountain. Then dug in his troops into the mountains, rendering the U.S. Naval bombardment effectively impotent.<br /><br />If we'd had today's liberal media back then, we would have quit after the first one thousand soldiers and marines were killed.<br /><br />I for one am glad we didn't have instant communication in 1944.<br /><br />Highly recommended for military buffs and fans of World war II action movies.<br /><br />Gunner  February, 2008</p></body></html>

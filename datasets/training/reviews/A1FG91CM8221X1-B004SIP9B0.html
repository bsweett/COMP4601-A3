For the House of Windsor, that difference is magnified a hundredfold. Trained fastidiously to be the living representatives of a thousand years of British history, cocooned from everyday life by their station and privilege, the members of the Royal Family adopted a becoming public dignity and reserve that served them well in the dark days of the London Blitz. Unfortunately, that reserve doesn't play so well in the democratized Britain of the Information Age, which makes them appear cold and unlikable while simultaneously blowing the cover off the times when they, shall we say, strain against the bonds of royal protocol.  Stephen Frears' "The Queen" masterfully depicts the event that finally brought home to the Royal Family the power of the media and the people--the tragic death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in the late summer of 1997. Remembering Diana as a selfish, neurotic troublemaker, Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren), Prince Philip (James Cromwell) and the Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms) have no conception of how beloved she was by the people, simply because she possessed the common touch the rest of them so conspicuously lack. Ensconced in luxurious isolation at Balmoral Castle, they maintain a starchy silence that new Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) recognizes immediately as a public relations catastrophe. Peter Morgan's superb screenplay details the frantic efforts of Blair to get the initially uncomprehending Elizabeth to reach out to her grieving subjects. While Philip and the Queen Mum pressure Elizabeth to stand her ground (Philip mocks the list of mourners at Diana's funeral as "a chorus line of pop stars and homosexuals"), Blair's anti-monarchist wife Cherie (Helen McCrory) urges him to let the Royal Family hang itself publicly as "a bunch of freeloading, anachronistic nutters." This is one of the most involving stories of political machination ever put on film, and extraordinarily courageous in that it portrays still-living heads of state in ways that are sometimes far less than flattering (will Prince Philip dare sue?). All the performances are a resounding affirmation of the glories of British Rep (and in this I include Cromwell, the one American ringer in the cast). But the film stands or falls in its portrayal of Elizabeth, and with the wonderful, fabulous Helen Mirren playing her, it not only stands but soars. Mirren won the Best Actress Award at the Venice Film Festival for her performance, and if there's any justice she should start rehearsing her Oscar speech. Mirren is one of the great living masters in portraying deep emotion behind a dignified facade, and "The Queen" gives her an unprecedented opportunity to do just that. (Mirren's Elizabeth gives us the textbook definition of "noblesse oblige:" standing at the gates of Buckingham Palace, reading the placards that essentially accuse her of being Diana's murderer, she makes the slightest grimace of sorrow, then turns to the assembled crowd and smiles.) "The Queen" is simply one of the best films to come out of Britain in the last decade. I would love to see a double feature of this film and "The Madness of King George"--in which Mirren played Queen Charlotte, the consort of George III. The House of Windsor might rebel at such an event, but the rest of us would be in for a treat.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Highly disappointing"></head><body><p>This review contains spoilers... However, if they prevent you from watching the film, consider that a good thing. You'd be better off if I just told you how it ended and saved you two hours of your life.<p>A horrible sense of disillusion dawned on me as I watched this third installment in the oversized Matrix trilogy. Suddenly I realized how trite and unoriginal the pseudo-philosophical concepts that guided the story were. These are the same concepts that the first two movies in the series followed, but this time it's much more obvious than ever before. The first film in the series, while not as original in conception as it seemed to me back then, had sparks of uniqueness and originality like few other movies - perhaps not in its concept but certainly in its writing, styling, and cinematography. The second one, while it didn't have that same spark, still managed to be satisfactory by incorporating several action scenes of immense originality and uniqueness in their styling and visualization. This third film doesn't even have that. I won't go against sequels and trilogies in general, because classics like Star Wars and The Godfather, not to mention more modern examples like Lord of the Rings and Kill Bill, could have never reached their full depth in only one film, but a filmmaker shouldn't have to do three films when he said all he had to say in the first one.<p>First, we have an impressive but rather pointless fight sequence in the Merovingian's bar. It might have been fitting for an opener if the rest of the film was more impressive. The mythological and theological hints in that scene are so obvious and overwhelming (the club is hell, the Merovingian is Hades, the Trainman is the Ferryman), yet they lead nowhere. Much more coherent were the creepy sadism-masochism not-so-subtle hints; but whether that was meant to have some meaning, or just to satisfy Larry Wachowski's odd passions, I don't know. The character of Seraph - `The Wingless Angel' - seems to be building towards something, but reaches no conclusion. This is one of many openings the trilogy leaves that make me fear a spin-off, an animated series or perhaps awful second-rate books written by fanboys like the ones Star Trek got. The scene in the train station is probably the best part of the movie, and I liked the low-key, minimal production feel of it. It got dwarfed, however, next to the laughs I got from the scene in which Trinity and Morpheus meet the Oracle - Mary Alice. The Wachowskis were at a loss as to how deal with the death of actress Gloria Foster, and did less than well in the ridiculous solution they came up with. I think I would have liked it better if the Oracle became a thin, young, blonde woman; that would at least show some guts.<p>The battle for Zion was of course impressive, but to me it seemed like little more than a big screen computer game. The whole thing was badly unconvincing, especially those MACH style Starship Troopers rip-off robots the rebels use. And since the directors created in me absolutely zero emotional connection to either Zion or any of the people in it (were we supposed to become emotionally attached to Zion after that horrible orgy/rave scene in the second movie? If so, badly done) I simply didn't care about the outcome. An important part of good sci-fi writing is, since the viewer obviously has no empathy for the characters or places beforehand, to make him care about them. Matrix Revolutions didn't do that. Zee, Link, Lock and all of these half-baked characters introduced to us in the second film are uninteresting and unimportant. That entire battle was too long and very dull.<p>As for the other big showdown - the battle between Neo and Smith... Neo already battled with Smith in the first and second movie, and both of these scenes were original and impressive. The duel in the first movie was wonderfully directed and choreographed, while the battle between Neo and the multiple Smiths in The Matrix Reloaded was original and exciting. This final battle is none of the above; it's dull, predictable and unimpressive, using every clich&eacute; imaginable. It consists mainly of Smith knocking Neo down and Neo getting up again, over and over. And let's not even discuss Trinity's horrible, oversized, melodramatic and pathetic death scene which would have made Wagner blush.<p>Another thing I realized watching this movie is that the only character in the entire trilogy that I really cared for, that really had a personality and characterization, was Agent Smith. Hugo Weaving is, I now realize, a fantastic actor, and he created a truly timeless and unique character. I also loved his real-world incarnation as Bane; I could see it was Smith long before he gave himself away with that `Mr. Anderson' remark. Could you possibly have recognized Neo or Trinity had they stumbled into another body? Smith is the only major creation which made the expansion of the series somewhat worthwhile. Morpheus was an interesting character in the first movie, but I could never forgive him after that horrible, hilarious speech he gave in Zion in the beginning of part 2. As for Neo, he was never very interesting since he became the One - I liked him better when he was a confused, clueless hacker. Despite any enjoyment I got from the second movie, the series would probably have been better off ending there.</p></body></html>

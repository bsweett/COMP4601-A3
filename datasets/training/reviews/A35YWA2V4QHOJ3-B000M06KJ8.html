Kirsten Dunst is a natural as the title role of Marie Antoinette, but beyond that the movie falters badly.  Even with all of the lavish sets & costumes, it simply doesn't resonate as a well done period film.  {If you're looking for a fabulous period film, albeit from a few hundred years earlier, then check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042RJWTC">The Tudors: The Complete Series</a>}<br /><br />The focus of the film is to depict a young Austrian girl who is shipped far away from home to a country full of rude people whom she's never met before.  She marries Louis XVI, but she hardly gets the  Harlequin Romance happy ending.  She becomes homesick & finds that her royal husband has little interest in her.  This leads to her becoming a spoiled, free-spending, fun-loving party girl who uses her status to get whatever she wants.<br /><br />The anachronistic soundtrack does not fit at all & I found it very distracting.  Hearing Rock songs juxtaposed with late 1700s France is not an auspicious combination ~ at least not to me.  On top of that, there are problems with the sound mixing as there were times that I couldn't hear the dialogue clearly because the music was too loud.<br /><br />The most egregious part of the movie is what it omits.  Yes, Bastille day goes on in the background of the movie and there are references to it (kind of like in a Shakespearian play) but it is not treated with a whole lot of depth.  The end of the movie shows the French king & queen riding in a chariot away from their palace and an angry mob.  Not to sound crude, but the arrest, imprisonment, (sham) trial and execution of Marie Antoinette are among the most interesting aspects of her life.  The "feel good" ending just doesn't fit.<br /><br />All in all, this production struck me as a cross between a 1980s brat pack movie & a high school play.  Very amateurish and disappointing overall.  Fans of history (and the French Revolution in particular) will not come away from watching this film with a good taste in their mouths.  As for fans of Kirsten....she makes the movie tolerable....albeit barely!</p></body></html>

That's largely because of the skills and sensibilities of auteur Alfred Hitchcock, specifically his deftness at manipulating audience expectation.  <p>Hitchcock deliberately gives PSYCHO the look of a cheap B-movie exploitation flick by filming it in black-and-white and employing not his usual cinematic crew, but instead the crew from his popular TV show ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS.  As for the plot, he sets up the Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) story as if it will be further developed and continue to the conclusion of the film.  When Marion steals a large sum of untraceable cash from her employer and then drives off with plans to meet her lover in another town and start a new life, the film is obviously a straight-forward heist drama, right?  Well, just when the audience thinks it knows where this plot is heading, a deranged killer gets thrown into the mix. Suddenly the film's timbre changes and the story abruptly shifts direction, thereby disrupting viewer expectation and, in turn, invoking tension and apprehension in the audience members. And of course, this primes the audience emotionally for the unexpected scares yet to come.  &quot;I was directing the VIEWERS,&quot; Hitchcock once told fellow director Fran?ois Truffaut. &quot;You might say I was PLAYING them...like an organ.&quot;<p>PSYCHO was based on Robert Bloch's popular pulp novel, which itself was inspired by the exploits of Wisconsin killer and ghoul Ed Gein.  After Hitchcock purchased the film rights from Bloch, he engaged the services of screenwriter Joseph Stefano--who would later develop and work on the classic 1960s TV genre series THE OUTER LIMITS--to adapt the novel to the screen.  Stefano's screenplay was relatively faithful to the source material, with two notable exceptions: middle-aged, balding Norman Bates was transformed into a handsome younger man; and the murder of Marion in the shower, described in the novel as one swift thrust of a butcher knife, was expanded into a major scene in which the young woman's body is violated by multiple knife thrusts that allude to the action of a rape.<p>Speaking of that infamous shower scene, the relatively short sequence took nearly 7 days to film and required over 70 camera setups and 90 editing cuts. Since red appears nearly black when filmed in black-and-white, copious amounts of chocolate syrup was effectively substituted for blood.  The sound FX for the stabs involved the shoving of a knife into a ripe melon, a technique that went on to become the standard for future slasher flicks.  And layered on top of it all was Bernard Herrmann's shrieking violin-heavy musical score.  The final result is extremely effective, and few cinematic sequences before or since can dole out the visceral wallop that this scene delivers.<p>As with many of Hitchcock's films, PSYCHO was groundbreaking cinema.  When that knife pierced that shower curtain and continued right on through to lovely Marion, horror was yanked from the realm of supernatural fantasy and firmly grounded in real-world possibility.  The monster was now the human mind.  Friendly, good-looking young men like Norman Bates could have nasty skeletons bursting forth from their psychological closets, and no longer was it a guarantee that the protagonist would survive all the way to the closing credits.<p>The Collector's Edition DVD from Universal studios is a digital treasure trove.  The transfer of the film itself, though offered in non-anamorphic letterbox widescreen, is clean and crisp, with pristine continuous-tone grays and dark, rich blacks.  Included in the delightful supplements is a 94-minute making-of documentary, the original 6-minute theatrical trailer in which Hitchcock himself takes viewers on a tour of the Bates Motel, newsreel footage, and much more.  This disc belongs in the collection of any horror fan or film aficionado.</p></body></html>

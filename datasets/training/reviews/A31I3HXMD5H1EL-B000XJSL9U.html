<meta name="summary" content="Yippee-ki-ay! Willis is BACK!"></head><body><p>"Live Free or Die Hard - Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)" is the BEST edition of the latest "Die Hard" installment, and certainly THE one to buy. Closest in spirit to the previous three films, the unrated version is more cohesive, funnier, and less PC than the 'cleaned-up' theatrical edition...but if you prefer PC, this edition offers the option of BOTH versions to choose from!<br /><br />Willis' 'John McClane' is the most likable of the action heroes introduced during the testosterone-driven 1980s, an honest cop unwillingly caught in the middle of brilliantly-conceived schemes of criminal masterminds, defeating them by outlasting them, physically, while tossing off some of the funniest one-liners you'll ever hear on screen. It's a formula ideally suited to Willis, and the latest installment, created by filmmakers who grew up on the original trilogy, succeeds in keeping things 'fresh' by raising the stakes, and playing up McClane as a 'dinosaur' in a high-tech world.<br /><br />The plot involves the shutting down of not a building, airport, or city, but the entire country (to steal billions of dollars...as McClane quips, "It's always about money"), and, aided by a pacifist computer geek (Justin Long), and his uber-hacker buddy (a very funny Kevin Smith, in a welcome cameo), Willis is ready to abuse his body again, to save the day!<br /><br />While the film's villain (Timothy Olyphant) lacks the urbane villainy of Alan Rickman or sophisticated panache of Jeremy Irons, his second-in-command (Maggie Q), is the sexiest opponent Willis has faced, yet, and the action sequences (done mostly 'live' rather than by CGI), are truly astonishing (particularly Willis 'taking on' a fighter jet in an 18-wheeler...you have to see it to believe it!)<br /><br />The 'Special Features' ARE special, as well; my favorite is an interview between Willis and unabashed "Die Hard" fan Kevin Smith, which manages to be both insightful and funny.<br /><br />Yippee-ki-ay INDEED!</p></body></html>

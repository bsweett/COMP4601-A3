The animation is great, and the story and music will keep you watching. I didn't catch this at the theater but I based my purchase on the trailers, and I am glad I did. My wife and I watched it and we loved it. I'm sure all ages will get a kick out of it. It mainly centers on the father Mr. Incredible, but has plenty of input from Elastigirl/Mrs. Incredible and their kids as well. Frozone didn't get as much action as I would have liked, but still plenty of action and a good story as usual. It seems like a cross between a James Bond movie and Spiderman, but with a whole family of superheroes.<br /><br />The Pixar animation is excellent. I loved the way they developed the nemesis of Mr. Incredible from his biggest fan. When Elastigirl realizes Mr. Incredible has been gone to long she suspects foul play and goes looking for him. Mrs. Incredible finds assistance in tracking him down from their funny and unusual clothing designer. Little do they know that many heroes have been destroyed by the nemesis of Mr. Incredible and he plans to send the robot that destroyed them to invade the city. Time is of the essence as they rush to save Mr. Incredible and stop the maniac that will destroy anyone that stands in his way to be the only hero. The DVD two disc set has many extras and is well worth the price.</p></body></html>

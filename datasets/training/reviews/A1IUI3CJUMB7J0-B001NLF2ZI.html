<meta name="summary" content="A smart intelegent but very slow drama that tries to be suspensfull"></head><body><p>The Interpreter is a story of a UN interpreter played by Nicole Kidman (who is very boring in her role and has no life) who hears an assisanation atempt on a African leader. Sean Penn( who is very borng) is investagating the plot. The movie has a good idea and is very smart and intelegent at times butt he satory drags on and on and on. the movie tries to be a suspens film but it dosent work there is only maybe 3 parts that are good. The movie started out good but went downhill fast. Overall the performances where bad and I love Nicole Kidman but this time she did not turn out good and the story was slow.</p></body></html>

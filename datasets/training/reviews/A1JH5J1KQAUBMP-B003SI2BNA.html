The cast is very good and the atmosphere is creepy, but there just isn't much to this story.  The narrative becomes confused by some plot elements that amount to nothing--why did the lawyer lie about being with his family?  Was the husband really plotting something with the suspicious teenagers?  It's a decent film, but nothing special.</p></body></html>

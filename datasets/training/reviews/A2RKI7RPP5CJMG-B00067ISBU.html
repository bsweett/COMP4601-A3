I have nothing to base a comparison on as such, so I'll review this movie as a person who just happened to pick this one up not knowing what to expect. What a surprise! This is an action-packed, but tender-hearted romp through the life of one of the kindest, cockiest heroes of our time. Ron Perlman is perfect as Hellboy. He manages to show us just how gruff and mean Hellboy can be, but he exposes the heart that lies inside our hero as well.<br /><br /> The rest of the cast is superb. Selma Blair has the quiet, stand-offish stereotype down pat. Doug Evans(though you can't see him with all of that make-up) is witty and engaging as Abe Sapien. John Hurt is excellent as Hellboy's &quot;father.&quot;<br /><br /> The story takes you on a rollercoaster of a ride with the paranormal gang hunting down Rasputin(yes, that Rasputin). Along the way we are introduced to a freakish Nazi assassin, some hellhounds, and a dead guy named Ivan. What you get in the end is an action flick full of comedy and heart. If your kids can handle the violence of flicks like &quot;MIB&quot; and &quot;Tremors,&quot; I think they can handle this. The language isn't too severe. I don't remember any &quot;f&quot; bombs being dropped at all.<br /><br /> Guillermo del Toro takes the slick, cool-looking set design and story movement of &quot;Blade 2&quot; and tosses it into this movie minus all of the techno music. Characters are developed well, and the story moves at a quick pace.<br /><br /> Overall, a great film to watch, even if you don't know who Hellboy is. The DVD isn't that shabby either, what with being loaded to the nines with extras for film and comic buffs alike.<br /><br /> I highly recommend this flick to everyone who enjoys comedy, action and maybe even a little horror.</p></body></html>

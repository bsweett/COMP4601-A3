<meta name="summary" content="Breakthrough approach to a forbidden subject, but too slow and too long."></head><body><p>I saw this film a couple of months ago but just haven't gotten around to reviewing it.  By now, of course, everyone knows the general plot.  And everyone has an opinion about this film whether he or she has seen this film or not.  The opinions tend to follow the person's views on the gay issue.  This seems a little unfair because I think a good film should stand by itself and not just be a reflection of a personal opinion about its theme.<br /><br />The credits are impressive.  Ang Lee directed it.  As always, he makes the audience really understand his characters.  The two cowboys, as played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenthal, become real and easily identifiable for their very human qualities.  The film is based on a short story by Annie Proulx.  She writes about the dark side of the American West, not the place of the great John Wayne myths.  The writer, Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana are also experts on the west.  I would expect nothing but the best from them.<br /><br />The story is complex and more than the sum of its parts.  It starts in 1963 when the two young men spend a summer working together herding sheep on the lonely Brokeback Mountain.  For the entire summer, they have no other human companionship.  Naturally, a bond develops between them.  And then, on one cold and lonely night, they have a brief romantic encounter.  They both would like it to be only a one-time thing, but it isn't.  Their feelings grow for each other.  Later, they are discovered, go back to their respective lives, and try to forget each other.<br /><br />Both men marry.  Both have children.  The marriages are not happy.  And there are some scenes between these men and their wives that show the sadness and impact of these flawed marriages.  Then, several years later, the men come together again, and from then on, they spend several weeks each summer continuing their relationship on Brokeback Mountain.  They say they are going there to fish; but they never do bring home any fish.<br /><br />The story takes place over couple of decades.  It is a gloomy story, one that the audience knows will end badly.  There's fine acting, great scenery and everything else that deserves the accolades it received.<br /><br />Problem is, the film runs 134 minutes which is much too long.  The action is subtle and brings up unsettling emotions.  After a short while, I knew I had gotten the point of the film.  The storyline didn't really change and there were no surprises.  I found myself constantly looking at my watch.  If I had been home in front of my DVD I know I would have fallen asleep.<br /><br />I commend Brokeback Mountain for its breakthrough approach to a forbidden subject and some great acting.  It was just a little too slow for my taste.</p></body></html>

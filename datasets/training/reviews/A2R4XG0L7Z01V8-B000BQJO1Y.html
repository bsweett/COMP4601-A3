<meta name="summary" content="I'm going to fall out with some people over this review!"></head><body><p>There may have been arguments over watching this movie and I lost miserably. I'd already seen the remake, didn't particularly care that much about seeing the original, but seemed like an appropriate movie to watch in the dark with plenty of alcohol. (And I still needed more) I wanted to watch The Mummy Returns, but I just watched it when I got home. I managed most of this movie, I did close my eyes a couple of times, cos it was really getting that boring. (A trick I perfected during Evil Dead 2, except I kept my eyes closed longer)<br /><br />What didn't I like about this movie? Two main things that spring to mind. The "zombies" for one. Almost every "zombie" movie portrays them as almost robotic. Some imagination could be used. Sure, they're the undead, but they're all pretty similar. It's not like Beetlejuice, where this person drowned, or this person got cut in half, or this person smoked too much. The "zombies" are just splattered with random bits of blood. I'd rather something like Beetlejuice, or where they seem normal until the very last minute. That would be more original.<br /><br />My second problem was the characters. I'm sorry but I did not feel any sympathy for them! Unless you're a very special birthday boy, or Mekhi Phifer, then you don't get any sympathy from me. Sorry characters.<br /><br />The special effects were quite good, considering this was made in the seventies. (Another thing, I rarely like seventies movies apart from Grease, and a couple of others. Give me Halloween and I'll throw it baack in your face) The blood looked slightly dodgy at times, but that's to be expected.<br /><br />I've noticed reading a few of the other reviews, they're done by men. I'm female (I can give you someone who can vouch for that). Maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it as much?<br /><br />Watch the remake or Shaun of the Dead. Much, much better.</p></body></html>

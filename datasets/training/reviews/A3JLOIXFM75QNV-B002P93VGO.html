<meta name="summary" content="A bland film that stays afloat only because of Jackman"></head><body><p>Before this film even came out, I read that they were going to make a darker, more violent and adult version of Wolverine. Hugh Jackman himself even hinted at it. Well, as it turns out, Wolverine is neither of those-nor is it memorable. The plot is somewhat on the silly side, filled with a very boring romance, boring characters and a not-so-interesting backstory on Logan/Wolverine. This movie explains the reason for his turning to Stryker to essentially become 'Wolverine' and the reason is pretty ridiculous. There is just something missing from this film that has plenty of action, but still feels empty. The scene in X-men 2 with Logan getting the adamantium metal insterted is completely redone here, and not in a good way- I thought they botched this up badly. In X-Men 2, Wolverine escaped a bleeding, distraught mess. In Wolverine, it was done rather plainly and not so interesting.<br /><br />I applaud Hugh Jackman for acting as if he actually WANTS to be in this film, as the rest of the actors sort of just appear and say their lines. Jackman really puts 100% in his role and though his character isn't as described in the comics, he is still very likable. His half-brother, Victor Creed, played by Liev Schreiber, should also be commended. He is clearly having a ball with his role, though his backstory is as bland as Logan's. The rest of the characters are extremely forgettable, and that includes Deadpool and Gambit-the latter has maybe 10 min of pointless screentime. There is a silly battle at the end featuring Deadpool and Wolverine and a boring ending. After the credits, there is a little bit of extra footage as well-again, nothing to get excited about.<br /><br />Also, the special effects are, at times, noticably bad, especially in regards to Wolverine's claws. It is very random though, but I can't fathom how with all that money going into a film like this, they could disregard something so blatant.<br /><br />I actually wanted to like this film, but the more I thought about, the more I found fault with it. My husband, who used to read the X-men comics, has stated that the inaccuracies are pretty glaring and appalling. I was just hoping for a good, fun film. Sadly, I guess I'll still have to wait. To be honest, it isn't as bad as the horrific X-Men 3, but it is close...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Back to Hell.&quot;"></head><body><p>That and other cheery senitments are waiting to be found in director Tim Burtons' &quot;Sleepy Hollow,&quot; an errie, stylish and smart slice modern horror.  Though &quot;Hollow&quot; may not be grab-your-seat-for-dear-life terrifying, the suspense is palpable and if you give the movie a chance, the tension and creepiness slowly seeps into your skin, and stays there.<p>Bouyed by Burton's unmistakeable visual storytelling style, the plot methodically plays out, leading Constable Ichabod Crane (Burton regular Johnny Depp), from his comfort zone of logical reasoning to far more uneasy territory:  A Headless Horseman loose in the small rural town of Sleepy Hollow cutting off heads almost at random...or is he?  Crane if baffled as to the reasons why, but he still finds time to develop a relationship between himself and a local noblewoman (Christina Ricci) while he investigates old grudges and conspiracies that lead to an unexpected, but senisble conclusion.<p>The cast here is outstanding, led by Depp, whom I am enjoying more with every new role I find him in.  His cautious Crane is a far cry from his turn as the flamboyant Jack Sparrow, but Depp is so achingly convincing you forget he ever donned eye-liner and a dingy three-cornered hat.  Ricci is effective, but next to Depp she is unfortunately dwarfed.  Chistopher Lee and Christoper Walken make brief appearances in the film, as a judege and the horsemen respectively.  Lee presides over his court with stately arrogance and Walken is devilishly deranged as the mad Horseman (When the horseman appears with his head of course).<p>Visually the film is wondrous.  The cinematography is breathtaking, giving a surreal gothic look to the film.  Sets are gorgeously designed from the dank town to some very creepy woods.  The film is also superbly edited, and the visual effects are just about seamless.  The horseman sequences are well-executed pieces of CGI (despite the occasional gore, one sees every head sliced off), and Crane's flashbacks to a troubled childhood are a feast for the eyes as well (albeit a bloody one).  But the gore cannot bring down a brilliantly crafted horror story, with a refreshing intelligence that puts most other horror films today to shame.</p></body></html>

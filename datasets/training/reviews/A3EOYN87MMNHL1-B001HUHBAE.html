I was wrong.  This is a wonderful movie, if you like true crime productions, and mind boggling even if you don't.  As a young Army wife who took a two week TDY to SF, I found myself staying in an el cheapo motel right next to The Presidio where Zodiac, who was still active, had done some of his most heineous handiwork.  I was frightened and always looking over my shoulder.  As a true crime buff, I had stayed aprised of his activities. I have even visited the Zodiac website many times since, where you can hear a recording of a Zodiac suspect's actual voice.  Chilling.  Who was the Zodiac?  Their best canditate has been cleared by DNA lab results of sealing one of the envelopes with his own saliva.  He was a clever guy, however and possibly tricked another person into sealing it for him before he put the address to the SF Police dept on it.  Police science will most probably give us the answer some day.  Jake Gyllenhaal as Greysmith is superb, as are the scenes that try to help us get inside the mind of the killer and the man obsessed with catching him.</p></body></html>

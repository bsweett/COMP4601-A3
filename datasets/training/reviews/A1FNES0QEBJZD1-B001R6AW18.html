<meta name="summary" content="King Kong on Blu Ray-the original movie"></head><body><p>When a boy in the 50's there were only 3 stations in N.Y.  There was a show called 'The Movie of the Week' and they would play the same movie 4 or 5 times a day, every day, for the week.  If it were King Kong, I watched it every single time that I was not in school or didn't have to be somewhere.  King Kong caught everyone's imagination and I have seen it 100's of times, never being bored.<br /><br />So how is the quality of this BluRay transfer.  Remember that this movie was released in 1933 so the technology was no where near what it is today.  My mother told me that her father took her to see the opening premier at Radio City Music Hall.  It's an old film.  However, with the discovery of an uncensored archive of the movie in the UK, the transfer quality to Blu Ray is about the best you can expect it to be.  There are some scenes early in the movie and a few with much daylight in them that do have plenty of grain but, at least for this movie, the grain brings you back to those old times and you never really notice it.  The jungle and stop motion scenes are beautiful to watch without artifacting and aliasing and without the film damage of dust and tears that we normally would come to expect.  The blacks are deep and unmolested.  In fact, in some areas they look a touch crushed.  Never the less, this is the best quality version of King Kong I have ever seen.  All censored scenes have been restored to the film as well.<br /><br />The audio is mono but the score fills the room and is clear and easy to understand so no complaints here that we do not have a 5.1 channel mix.  Heck, back in 33 the word stereo had not been invented yet.<br /><br />This brings me to my only complaint about the DVD itself.  I found that switching to sections of the menu was quite difficult.  When I first put it in the player the movie started with the subtitles running.  I went back to the menu but could not direct the highlighter to 'none' and had to  pop the disc out and put it back in again to go to the default.  This occurred a few times.  Same thing with the special extras, I found it very difficult to actually use the remote arrows to go to a specific extra.  I found that the easiest thing to do was just hit enter, and the extras played in order.<br /><br />The documentaries of the film makers and their inspirations were very interesting and informative and Peter Jackson's recreation( and how he went about it) of the lost spider sequence was just brilliant and, for me, well received.  He did the original film proud.<br /><br />For anyone even remotely considering the purchase of this Blu Ray DVD, go ahead, as a King Kong fan, you will be glad you did.<br />Hope you found this review useful, and, if so, please click on the 'helpful' button so I know I am on the right track.</p></body></html>

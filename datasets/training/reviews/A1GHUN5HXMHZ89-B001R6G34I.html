<meta name="summary" content="Most Innovative Movie of its Time"></head><body><p>People that did not grow up watching this on Sunday TV matinees may not appreciate this movie as much. Anyone born in the last twenty years probably thinks Star Wars, Blade Runner, or some other SciFi is the best of the Century. I myself must vote for King Kong. My reasons are simple. I have probably seen about every SciFi movie made in the last seventy plus years, and none were so well done for their time as King Kong. This movie influenced many people in the industry to strive for their best in the genre.<br /><br />Ray Harryhausen who was the best stop motion animator was greatly influenced by Willis O'Brien's work in this movie. Ask directors like Peter Jackson, George Lucas, and Steven Spielberg and they will tell you it had a profound impact on them. Everything seemed to come together in this 1933 movie. The acting although a little corny has a nice appeal. The music is a nice touch of glitz in the city and foreboding danger in the jungle. It's the adventure the movie takes us on that we love most. The sets were done masterfully and the big ape himself was remarkable. The creatures truly frightened people many years after it's original release in the theater.<br /><br />This set includes many extras like a theater guide, poster, documentary, et cetera. I am very pleased with the care Warner took in the reproduction of King Kong. The picture and sound quality are excellent. I have complained for many years that this movie should have been put on DVD. I am glad to see it is finally released. The last remake of King Kong was not very successful, it will be interesting to see if the Peter Jackson remake becomes a classic.</p></body></html>

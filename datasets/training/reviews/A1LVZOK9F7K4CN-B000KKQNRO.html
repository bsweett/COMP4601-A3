<meta name="summary" content="Diverting..."></head><body><p>I went into this movie with low expectations because of all the negative reviews it has received.  I was amused at the different reactions at the end of the film.  The annoying guy on my left shouted "wonderful!" and the guy on my right said: "What an awful movie!"<br /><br />In the end, I was diverted for the time I was there, but the negative reviews are right.  1)  The movie is LONG!  This is ironic because the novel was a fast read.  The pacing is just off.  There is too much backstory that they try to jam in.  2)  There are needless changes to the plot of the book.  The effect is that it makes a silly story even sillier.  3)  One-dimensional characters.  Robert Langdon is a cipher in the book and a cipher in the movie.  (Also, Tom Hanks' voice sounds odd.)  The only characters I cared about were Silas and Leigh Teibing.  4)  There is an overall lack of suspense and excitement.<br /><br />Now, for people unfamiliar with the book, there might be the element of surprise.  Also, the film plays as a wonderful travelogue for London and Paris.  The cities look great.  If this film makes people want to read and travel more, that is a good thing.</p></body></html>

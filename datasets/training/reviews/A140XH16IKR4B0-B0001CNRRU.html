<meta name="summary" content="Great story, well told"></head><body><p>Take the stories of three people, etch them on a pane of glass, smash the pane into shards, then rearrange the shards. That's the way this incredible movie is told. A math teacher (Sean Penn), a born again social worker (a haggard-looking Benicio del Toro) and a recently-widowed mom (Naomi Watts) live lives that intersect around a traffic accident and a heart transplant. The story unfolds over the course of the movie, juxtaposing past and present in a display of superb plotting. Aside from the three principals, Melissa Leo (as del Toto's long-suffering wife) and others turn in stunning performances.<br /><br />The 21 grams of the title refers to an old discredited study that purports that at death, we lose exactly 21 grams of weight, attributable to the soul leaving the body. But the "soul" in question here is less about immortality than about the life force exhibited when people enter each others' lives.<br /><br />A stunning movie of great art, heart and subtlety.</p></body></html>

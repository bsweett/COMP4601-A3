As the film opens, the Pope has died.  Before the Conclave of Cardinals can assemble to select a new Pope, the preferitti, the four leading contenders for the position, are kidnapped.  A threat of their assassination as well as the total destruction of the Vatican City is made, and a mysterious symbol is found.  Langdon is summoned to the Vatican and determines that the kidnapping is the work of the Illuminati, a centuries-old deadly secret society.<br /> "Angels & Demons" is filled with red herrings, some obvious, others that come as a surprise.  Director Ron Howard keeps us guessing as a literal bomb ticks away and the lives of four cardinals hang in the balance.  There are several strong supporting performances. Ewan McGregor plays Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, the man in charge of the Vatican during the transitional period between the death of one Pope and the election of the next.  Stellen Skarsgard plays the head of the Swiss Guard, the Pope's personal security staff.  Armin Mueller-Stahl portrays the elector in the Conclave of Cardinals.<br /> Author Dan Brown's formula -- creating maze-like mysteries in the milieu of the Catholic Church -- allows him to combine murder with clouded motives and Church history to elevate what would otherwise be fairly ordinary whodunits.  "Angels & Demons" is a stylish film directed with care by Mr. Howard, who understands the importance of good casting in making a movie click.<br /> "Angels & Demons" is available in three editions: single-disc DVD, two-disc DVD, and two-disc Blu-ray.  The two-disc DVD edition's bonus extras include the featurette "Handling Props," in which the filmmakers discuss bringing the props from Dan Brown's book to life; and "Angels & Demons: The Full Story," a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film.  The Blu-ray edition contains these extras as well as both the theatrical and extended film versions; "The Path of Illumination," which follows Robert Langdon's path through Rome; "Movie IQ," containing loads of production facts, cast and crew details, and music and soundtrack info; and a digital copy of the movie.</p></body></html>

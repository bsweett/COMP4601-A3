The story was  interesting and some parts were very heart moving.<br /><br />Equilibrium has a unique action style which uses very fast hand movements. Contrary to Matrix 1 which uses slow motion bullet time speed.<br /><br />I also recommend another movie named The Returner. Which has a different style, but is good for sci-fi action fans.</p></body></html>

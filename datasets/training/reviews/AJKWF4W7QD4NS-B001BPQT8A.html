<meta name="summary" content="A masterpiece of a film, and a masterpiece of a DVD"></head><body><p>Director David Fincher made up for his dreadful directorial debut Alien 3 with this superbly crafted thriller that became the most unnerving serial killer film since The Silence of the Lambs.  Veteran detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is teamed with young detective Mills (Brad Pitt) to track a serial killer who is basing his murders on the seven deadly sins.  Freeman and Pitt are both great in they're respective roles, but Gwyneth Paltrow is mostly wasted as Pitt's wife.  The best performance however goes to Kevin Spacey as John Doe, the seemingly insane killer that we soon find out may not be so insane after all.  This is where Fincher began to display the skills of the type of director he would become in his later films like Fight Club and Panic Room.  The look of the film honestly, is pretty depressing, but that mood sets the tone of Seven perfectly, and the atmosphere of the film carries a sense of dread almost throughout the entire film.  Freeman's characterization of the weathered and disenchanted Somerset is one of his best roles in his distinguished career.  Pitt's characterization of a hot headed cop is one of his better roles as well, but as I said before, Kevin Spacey gives the best performance of the film and is purely chilling.  What makes John Doe chilling however, is not his crimes, but the fact that when he speaks his reasons why, he makes a frightening sense of it.  The DVD itself is packed with extras including four seperate commentaries and an alternate ending (plus an un-shot ending done with storyboards) along with tons more, and is possibly New Line's best produced DVD to date.  All in all, consider this essential viewing.</p></body></html>

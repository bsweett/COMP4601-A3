<meta name="summary" content="Holly Martins' European Education"></head><body><p>The Third Man, 1949 film<br /><br />The film begins showing post-war Vienna which is divided into four sectors. Holly Martins arrives, he was promised a job (he walks under ladders). Harry Lime isn't there to meet him, he is being buried today. Martins arrives at the graveyard. A stranger offers him a ride and a drink, then pumps him for information. Martins writes "cheap novelettes", the westerns that were popular then. Crabbins offers Martins a job to lecture on the contemporary novel; he will be paid. Then Baron Kurtz calls for a meeting; he was a friend of Harry Lime. Martins visits Harry's girlfriend Anna Schmidt, who acts in a classic comedy. She accepts the loss of Harry, and tries to move on with her life. Martins learns more details about Lime's death: his driver, his friends, and his doctor were all there. Was it really an accident?<br /><br />Martins and Miss Schmidt return to Lime's apartment. The porter tells about Lime: "he was quite dead", killed at once. There was a third man present at the death scene! The porter doesn't want to get involved with the police. Next they learn the police are investigating Miss Schmidt, and she is brought in for questioning about her identity papers. Martins visits Dr. Winkel, Lime's medical advisor. Miss Schmidt was used to send a message to Joseph Harbin, who went missing the day Lime died. Martins visits the Casanova Club where Harry's friends hung out. Mr. Popescu tells how the death happened. Martins asks about the third man, and tells what the porter saw. Popescu says he doesn't know much more. The porter asks Martins to return that night, but after he closes the window he is startled as if he saw a ghost. Martins tells Anna about Harry, how he could fix things and knew how to fiddle the rules. When they go to visit the porter they find he was murdered. Did he know too much?<br /><br />Holly Martins speaks to the literary club. He seems to be over his head among the literary crowd. Two hard looking men pursue him, but he flees through dark alleys to escape. Major Calloway explains the racket that Lime organized. Stolen penicillin was watered down and sold for enormous profits. The facts convince Martins. Before he leaves he visits Anna Schmidt to say goodbye. On his way home Martins is startled to see a watcher in a doorway. He reports this to Calloway, who investigates and discovers buried facts. Martins goes to meet Harry Lime to warn him of what the police know. The conversation reveals Lime's amorality, and Lime's ignorance of history. Martins makes a deal to save Anna, but she doesn't want to be saved [symbolism?]. Martins is convinced to help Calloway by meeting Lime while the police keep watch. The trap works, Lime flees underground among the rats while the authorities pursue. A special force searches the sewer system. There is a dramatic ending to the chase that echoes "He Walked By Night". Martins settles his debts with his old friend. [Lime had picked him for the patsy.] The film ends with another funeral, not a Hollywood ending. [This fast-paced film entertains without drawing attention to the improbable events.]</p></body></html>

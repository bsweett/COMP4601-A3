It's a movie at its best! Great storyline, great characters, a little spookiness and alot of twist & turns that you will never see coming!<br /><br />The trailer for this movie, makes it out to much scarier than it is, but the movie will not disappoint.<br /><br />If you watch this movie and like/love it, watch Del Toro's other movies, they are all good- Pan's Labyrinth, The Devil's Backbone and Hellboy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Great New Look At An Old Classic"></head><body><p>There are so many great old films that suffer due to scratched and inferior video copies. The Third Man is such a film. My old VHS copy of the film had numerous splices, dirt marks, etc. In addition, the sound was  muddled and murky, making it hard to understand what the characters were  saying. Anton Karas' unique zither score was ruined, and Graham Greene's  unforgettable dialogue was almost unintelligible.<p>The DVD edition,  however, is clear with great sound. The dialogue is distinct and the  musical score sound great. The DVD details the restoration and shows before  and after clips that make you truly appreciate the work The Third Man's  restorers put into it. In addition, the DVD features many extras about the  making of the film as well as newsreel footage about the film at the time  of its release. It took fifty years, but The Third Man now has the quality  home video version it deserves. Switzerland may have only given us the  cuckoo clock, but Criterion has given us a new and beautiful at one of the  greatest films of all time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Only one is a wanderer; two together are always going somewhere.""></head><body><p>John Ferguson (James Stewart) is a retired cop; he's got a severe case of vertigo and remorse after his friend fell off a building to his death in an attempt to save John. Now, he mopes around the house all day with his admiring friend Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) in tow, hoping he'll snap out of it. He gets his chance when he is approached by Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), a man concerned about his wife. It seems Madeleine (Kim Novak) has been going into trances and wandering around town. Gavin wants John to follow her around to gauge the severity of the situation and to determine whether she should be institutionalized. John takes the job reluctantly, and begins to fall for Madeleine in the process. She seems to be channelling a doomed ancestor, and John's fondness for her makes him all the more adamant at finding the cause of the problem instead of sending her away. However, things are not as they seem.<br /><br />This is an interesting role for Stewart, who normally plays a wholesome good ol' boy with a heart of gold. His character here is much more realistic, but since he is the eyes of the viewer, he is still likable. John is an imperfect character, so it is an interesting part to see him play. Stewart's blue eyes photograph really strangely so they create a haunting effect, the way blue eyes looked on the silent screen. Hitchcock most likely used this to his advantage to show the viewer that every character is suspect regardless of how pure they seem.<br /><br />There are many twists in the plot, as is typical of Hitchcock. Not all of them are welcome twists. The subject begins with a psychological and paranormal context, but ends in realism. This descent from one extreme to the next is somewhat disappointing, but it is certainly an interesting ride.</p></body></html>

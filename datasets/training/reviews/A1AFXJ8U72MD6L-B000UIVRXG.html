<meta name="summary" content="A FUN GOOFY FILM THAT I WISH I HAD WATCHED EARLIER!"></head><body><p>This is a fun, goofy film that delivers on the fun and is a satire on the buddy action films of our recent past.  Fans of SHAUN OF DEAD will recognize Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, and, for trivia buffs did you see two supporting actors who were Roman Patricians in HBO's ROME?  According to the inside rumors  Santa Claus was Peter Jackson and the ex girlfriend was Cate Blanchett but since both of them are masked its hard to verify.  Lots of gags and other such jokes with physical humor included.  Helps if you like British humor.  Timothy Dalton, former James Bond, plays a smarmy villain.  A lot of the story points are way way way way (waaaaaayyy!!!) over the top but if you go in knowing this is a goofy satire, well, you should be okay.  It helps if you've seen a lot of movie references they are making but it's not required for you to enjoy the film.  If you are a total movie buff a lot of the supporting cast were villains and foils in older action buddy pictures.  My favorite movie reference was in regards to what a cop said to Jack Nicholsan in CHINATOWN.  In closing what more is there to say but "Yarp" and you won't understand that reference unless you see the picture so check it out. HUMOR: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: Mid March; OVERALL GRADE: B plus.</p></body></html>

The gore - and I saw the uncut gore - wasn't all that gruesome, in my opinion. There were long stretches of time where nothing much happens - especially since the "unconventional ending" was explained in the very beginning of the film.<br /><br />Given the interesting ending, some explanation would have been nice other than another entry for The Celluloid Closet Part 2.</p></body></html>

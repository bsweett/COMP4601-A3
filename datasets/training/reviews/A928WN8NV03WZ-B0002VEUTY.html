<meta name="summary" content="Great movie despite its flaws"></head><body><p>This is an interesting followup to the Pitch Black movie.  A movie that was probably designed to be standalone, but generated such a cult following of the classic antihero Riddick, that producers were screaming for a followup.  Though it definitely suffers from plot oriented flaws,, it seems to survive all of them and end up being a highly enjoyable movie.<br /><br />Goths are conquering the universe.  Well not technically speaking, but a group called the Necromongers, a strange theocracy are going planet to planet and forcing others to either submit to their ideals and join them, or die. They are preparing to go and conquer their version of the holy lands called the "underverse".  Their leader"the grand marshal" has been there and returned something not quite human.  There is a rumor that a Furion will defeat them.  But that seems unlikely since the Necromongers killed them all off.<br /><br />This is where Riddick enters.  He has been on remote planets to escape from bounty hunters.  When a group of hunters finally catch up with him he returns to civilization to figure out how they found him so easily.  So he goes to find the one person he told where he was going, a familar face from the last movie.  Then he discovers that it is more than just law departments looking for him.  He is apparently a child of destiney, though this is a destiney that he wants no part of.<br /><br />This was a highly enjoyable movie.  It suffered from some flaws that slowed it down a bit.  The bad guys get little explanation, they are shown as fanatics, highly organized, possibly brainwashed, and high tech.  The Lord Marshal is shown to be supernatural in some way, but his character unfortunately doesn't get much screen time.<br /><br />A lot of characters aren't developed as they should be, making them seem more like plot devices than people.<br /><br />The plot seems pretty thin, but it feels as though there is going to be a sequel.  It is practically implied in the name, chronicles of riddick.<br /><br />But overall the movie succedes in being a good action film, and science fiction.  The special effects and cinematography are all top notch.  The action sequences are well filmed and exciting.  Plus Vin Diesel is in top form as Riddick.  Who is offically in the ranks of classic anti heroes(ie: snake plisken, Han Solo, Leon the Professional, Frank Castle, and Blade).  The humor is dark and the characters gritty and mostly believable.  In short, watch it, you won't be moved, but you will enjoy the ride.</p></body></html>

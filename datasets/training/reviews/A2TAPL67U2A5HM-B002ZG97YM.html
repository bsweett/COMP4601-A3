The story is about hiccup who lives in a viking village that fights dragons. One day he finally meets eye to eye with a very rare dragon and the adventure begins. The animation is topnotch and the music is also great. The story line is well developed and the characters are funny and charming. Highly recommended. 5/5.</p></body></html>

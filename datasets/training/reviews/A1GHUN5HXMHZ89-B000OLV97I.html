<meta name="summary" content="Read the book or watch the movie, not both"></head><body><p>Please book reviewers, review the books, movie reviewers review the movies, and never the twain should meet. Make you a deal I won't review books and expect them to be as good as the movies if you won't review the movies and expect them to be good as the books. Is it a deal? No offence but I rarely read a book reviewers review of a movie and hear anything but the movie stank.<br /><br />I didn't read these books so I can't say anything about them. But a good example is I did read the J.R.R. Tolkien books for years, long before the movies. The movies were not as good as the books, but you know what I loved the movies anyway. I realize that there was no way Peter Jackson could put all that was in the books into movies. Now if you say, I wished they had covered something better, I can understand and appreciate that. Just please don't trash it because it doesn't have everything from the book.<br /><br />I liked it myself. They obviously ended it in a way they could make a sequel. If you like medieval and fantasy movies you will probably like it. If you enjoy movies about Dragons you will probably love it. Not as good as "Dragonheart", but certainly well worth seeing. I think with a little more comedy from a well known actor and it would have been outstanding. That's why "Dragonheart" stands out so clearly in my mind is a few nice comedy moments put in to lighten the mood some of the time. Good family movie and good replayability.</p></body></html>

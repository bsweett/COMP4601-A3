<meta name="summary" content="a solid book adaptation that makes you want to see it again"></head><body><p>This movie was made of awesome.<br /><br />I haven't reread the book, as I've done previously with the films, so I wasn't in my nit-picking mood.<br /><br />Plus, the special effects looked fabulous. Both Dobby and Kreacher looked real and, although my brain knows that Nagiri isn't real, my eyes couldn't tell that.<br /><br />The trio are so much better actors now than they were in the previous six films - whatever advice or acting lessons they took paid off.<br /><br />Alan Rickman appears in the film not nearly enough but steals the show for the 2 milliseconds he is on screen.<br /><br />I thought that the storyline and the necessary revisions, as well as additions were handled well. I would see this movie again in theaters. Soon.</p></body></html>

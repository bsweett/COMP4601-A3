The problem is that there were too many subplots that took away from the storyline and depth of character for Hugo, Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s and most importantly the automaton. The dogs; the security guard; store front owners were nice touches but became overbearing superficial distractions. By showing the films of M&eacute;li&egrave;s the movie accomplished one of it's goals which was showing us the history of cinema (as an aside I believe that to understand any subject requires knowing it's history whether it's physics or politics) but I would have liked to have seen even more of his diverse accomplishments. The most obvious missing story was that of the automaton. I was waiting for much more of not only it's history but to see it do more whether in reality (they were amazing devices) or just with fantasy. The automaton essentially just disappeared. Finally, I was disappointed that they couldn't come up with a more positive way for Hugo to sustain himself than continually stealing, lying - bad message for the younger viewers.</p></body></html>

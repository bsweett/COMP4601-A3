<meta name="summary" content="controversial sci fi movie makes waves!"></head><body><p>This movie is disturbing, so disturbing that it raises all kinds of issues. It is so controversial that if you are insecure about your sexuality it might make you angry.  There's sex change in this one, theirs violence and mutant lab experiments, their sex and other things with animal person. Yes, this one inspires alot of violent reactions from some people. They say the acting is poor even! but it's not , the acting is fine, well done even. It's just that they can't handle this movie. So ignore the one star reviews that harp on acting, the fact is that the acting is fine here. THe effects are great here the morality of these scientists is not so good perhaps but this is a sci fi movie so just sit back and enjoy the ride. Anyways the blu ray looks stunning and this being a modern movie should be no less than that. It's worth getting on blu ray so grab this one while you can before the angry reviews burn all the copies! after all calling this the worst movie ever is silly! They should watch the many truly bad no budget movies I have seen! that are one star affairs to most reviewers but you can't judge them on a regular scale , this one you can , it's a big budget movie and a good sci fi film that will disturb many viewers and is not suitable for kids at all.  But it is for sci fi fans like me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Funny Ichabod"></head><body><p>Though I have heard about the title for a long time &amp; I knew there was a headless horseman, I really did not know the in-between plot.  So when I saw the DVD in our shop, I eagerly watched it with my husband. <p>Sure, the setting, especially at the start, was spooky, what with the jack-o-lanterns &amp; the sprawling fog.  There was also the continuous brewing mystery among the 'old town officers' &amp; their knowledge/connection with the mysterious decapitations happening in Sleepy Hollow.  The twist of events will surely catch you off-guard.<p>Johnny Depp/Ichabod was a funny character.  He portrayed an investigator promoting his latest techniques/discoveries in the crime field.  But despite the profession he got himself into, he was not really a tough guy but more of a scaredy cat.  He made me laugh all through the movie.  It is rare that you see the lead character bringing the light/funny moments in a suspense/thriller movie.<p>Christina Ricci likwise played the role quite well.  However, I don't find their teaming up fitting perfectly well, though I can't point out exactly what was wrong in their chemistry.<p>Overall, I recommend viewers to watch the movie.  It's a good movie &amp; not a waste of time at all.</p></body></html>

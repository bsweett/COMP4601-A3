<meta name="summary" content="A (Dyslexic) Film Noir!"></head><body><p>Chris Nolan movies are starting to grow on me.  The director of Following, Batman, etc., tells a story of a guy who has no short-term memory, who keeps notes all over the place, even tattooing the more important ones, to remember what happened an hour or even ten minutes before.  It's also about a drug-dealing gal who wants to get back at her boyfriend and a few other guys and uses our hero's lack of memory to use him for her own vengeance.<br /><br />It's a story about vengeance and the blocks in the road to achieving it, that even with your handicap you can stay the course.  But what if the course is twisted and you can barely remember the whys and hows of it all?<br /><br />It's about a guy who feels guilty for what he did to a guy who had the same condition and also had a wife who died.<br /><br />Nolan's film is the most unusual cinematic adventure I've ever seen.  It's not your basic action thriller, though there's plenty of both.  It plays backwards.  You get the ending right from the start and then find how he got there.<br /><br />I heard that there is a "linear" version that goes from the "end" and moves to the "beginning", but that would be really dumb.  That defeats the whole premise!<br /><br />Get the DVDs on Amazon, it's a must-own for sure.<br /><br />Other Nolan films:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000F3CD">Following</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LC55F2">The Prestige</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001WQQWXA">Batman Begins, Two Disc Deluxe Edition, Hologram Cover</a></p></body></html>

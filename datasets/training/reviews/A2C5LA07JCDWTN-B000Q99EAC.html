It may be fun to see some familiar faces for awhile, but then you realize after about a half an hour that your glad you've moved on to new friends and possibilities. I absolutely loved the first four Rocky films, so don't take me for a Rocky hater, I'm far from one. But Rocky Balboa is not a good film. The pacing is slow and boring, the story is way past played out and the final fight scene contains the least amount of actual "fighting" that I have ever seen in a Rocky film. Antonio Tarver is the worst "villain" as he is basically devoid of any emotion in this film. There is no real beef between him and Rocky. On the whole the story line is utterly ridiculous and even though I tried to tell myself that this is just a movie, I still couldn't get past some of the nonsense. For instance, in this "exhibition" match for charity, if one of these men were knocked down twice in one round the fight would have been stopped. No exhibition fight would ever go the distance with it's participants cut and bleeding. So be prepared to suspend your belief in reality for the 1:42 minute running time of this film. It's clear that Stallone was unhappy with the way the series was ended (Rocky V was an utter train wreck), so he has basically come back to finish the series with some class and dignity. The question is...who cares? Some people will I'm sure, but I guess I'm way past the point of caring. Recommended only to hardcore Rocky fanatics.</p></body></html>

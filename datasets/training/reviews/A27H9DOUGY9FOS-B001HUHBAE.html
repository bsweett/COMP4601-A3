<meta name="summary" content="An Ambitious Retelling Of The Zodiac Investigation--An Adult Film About Real Characters"></head><body><p>As the beginning of any new year rolls around, after awards season, there tends to be a significant drop off in quality or what you might call serious drama.  Usually we're left with crowd pleasing, if not critically acclaimed comedy, or low budget horror until the kickoff of the summer season.  There are a few gems that sneak in once in a while (perhaps the most notorious was "Silence of the Lambs" with its oddly timed Valentine's opening), but as a generalization--this is true more often than not.  So David Fincher's "Zodiac," which make no mistake is a drama--not a thriller, is a welcome respite from traditional fare at this time of the year.  Fincher, who made an artistic splash with "Se7en," "The Game," and "Fight Club," has been noticeably absent since hitting it big with the more routine "Panic Room" in 2002.  Eschewing the sensationalistic approaches a film of this type might employ, Fincher has crafted a sprawling and ambitious investigative drama about the men whose lives were changed in the obsessive hunt for a serial killer known only as Zodiac.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the story, I will borrow an excerpt from my review on "The Zodiac" (a lesser film that covers some of the same ground, but concentrating more on Zodiac's earlier murders in Vallejo).  "Over a period of years during the sixties and seventies, the San Francisco area was plagued by a series of seemingly random murders perpetuated by a man known only as the Zodiac killer. Using the press and taunting the police, Zodiac became one of the more prominent "celebrity" serial killers with his need to be in the spotlight."  Fincher's film focuses primarily on three major characters, although a huge cast contributes to this complex tale.  There is David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) who is the lead police investigator when the Zodiac moved to San Francisco, Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) who is the star reporter covering the case for the San Francisco Chronicle, and Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is a cartoonist at the Chronicle who becomes obsessed with the case.  In fact, Graysmith's obsession turned into the book which serves as source material for this film.<br /><br />Clearly, the strongpoint of the film is in the performances.  Downey is impeccable in self destructive mode--recapturing some of the energy and unpredictability that made him a star in the first place.  Ruffalo is great--persistence turning into frustration.  But it is Gyllenhaal who makes the greatest transformation from an awkward youth to someone willing to sacrifice everything to pursue an obsession.  The immense cast of supporting characters are, also, well written and beautifully performed.  It is in the details of the script that characters, even with limited screen time, leave a lasting and believable impression.  The film, which spans decades, recreates the time frame accurately--the art direction, in particular, is spectacular when viewing this city of the recent past.<br /><br />The story, itself, is a procedural--recounting years of work trying to locate Zodiac.  Again, the script is so detailed that you really feel as if you are following the action in the same step by step fashion that the real participants must have.  "Zodiac," ultimately, is a smart film.  It trusts that you will follow its logic, and perhaps even draw some conclusions of your own.  It paints a picture of who Toschi and Graysmith believed to be Zodiac (despite evidence to the contrary), but the film is open-ended enough for you to accept this position or discount it entirely.  There is plenty of intrigue as the investigation leads to unlikely places, some chilling recreations of Zodiac's killings, but most of all--real drama about real people.  A great adult picture.  At over 2 1/2 hours, it's a commitment--but one well worth it.  KGHarris, 03/07.</p></body></html>

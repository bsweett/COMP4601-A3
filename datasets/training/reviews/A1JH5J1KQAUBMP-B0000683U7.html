<meta name="summary" content="Exciting chase"></head><body><p>Cary Grant is Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive who gets mixed up in espionage when he is mistaken for a secret agent named George Kaplan.  He meets up with the beautiful and mysterious Eva Marie Saint and the two embark on a dangerous game of cat and mouse that culminates in a chase across Mount Rushmore.  <p>This is a suave and intelligently scripted entertainment, although it is quite contrived at times.  After all, could anyone really  cradle a dying man and pluck the knife out of his body by accident the way Grant does at the UN?  And, handsome though he may be, Grant seemed a little old for a hottie like Eva Marie Saint to be throwing herself at him without an ulterior motive.  It seemed odd to me that he never appeared to question that her attraction to him was spontaneous and genuine.  Maybe I'm nit-picking.  James Mason and Martin Landau are fantastic as the villains!</p></body></html>

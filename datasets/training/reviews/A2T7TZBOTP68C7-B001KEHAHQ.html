<meta name="summary" content="Steve Martin is the New Clouseau"></head><body><p>Sacre Bleu, Steve Martin is not just funny in the remake of The Pink Panther - he is priceless.  This is mostly due to his outrageous French accent.  During the scene toward the end, where Clouseau is working with an American dialect coach to say, "I would like to buy a hamburger," I laughed so hard that I couldn't breathe and had a coughing fit.  My stomach ached, too.  Wow.  That's good stuff.<br /><br />How the mystery is solved at the end is dumb - I wish they had put more cleverness into the whodunnit aspect.  Some mystery lovers may feel insulted at the hastily slapped together resolution.</p></body></html>

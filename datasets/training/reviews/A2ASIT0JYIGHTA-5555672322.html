<meta name="summary" content="3D rather disappointing"></head><body><p>Friday the 13th Part 3 is the best of the first 3, in my opinion. This is not because of the 3D effects, it is that there are more enjoyable characters and more murders to watch. I was lucky enough to see this in 3D at the cinemas back in 1983, and these effects added value to an already good sequel.<br /><br />There are many reviews here stating how bad the 3D is which has been presented on the new deluxe DVD. In a nutshell, it is. There are odd moments of acceptability, but essentially it is dismal. This could be because the 3D technology used way back in 1982 does not work well on today's viewing monitors. I watched it on a 40" LCD TV, maybe LCD is what stuffs it up. The red/blue glasses don't help the experience either. They make your eyes feel weird and you can suffer headaches as a result. However, these type of glasses are necessary to view 3D films of that era. Simply put, you can't use modern 3D glasses (i.e. black lenses) to watch old time 3D movies.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, when objects come out of the screen in Friday the 13th Part 3, as part of the 3D effect, it just looks terrible. It blurs and the effect is lost. It may be worth trying to watch the DVD on your computer or a smaller screen to see if it resolves it. Also, the red/blue glasses give the overall picture a tint which makes the film unrealistic.<br /><br />I'm not sure if you can blame Paramount for any of the issues with this 3D movie being transferred to DVD.  As I said, there are the odd few scenes where the 3D effect works well, but overall it is no fun to watch. I understand Paramount have been hassled for years to release the 3D version on DVD but declined - possibly for all the problems I have listed above. That is probably why the original DVD of this movie came with the 2D version.<br /><br />So is it worth buying this DVD? Well, the disc does come with the 2D version which is nicely cleaned up. BUT, the remixed 5.1 sound is nothing to rave about, and most of the noise still comes out of the one speaker (like the original DVD). There are no special features except for a trailer and two sets of 3D glasses.<br /><br />Save your money, and stick with your original DVD. You've been warned!</p></body></html>

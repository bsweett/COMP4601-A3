His character was BOURNE amnesiac, but BOURNE to be a hardcore fighting machine.  He's BOURNE to provide good mix of espionage and action.  And he's BOURNE to bring the best of what this movie has to offer.<br /><br />~REVIEW~<br /><br />"The Bourne Supremacy" is the second chapter of an already-popular spy-thriller series based on the best-selling books by Robert Ludlum.  Jason Bourne is back once again, beating up bad guys that get in his way with such swift charisma and a stealth ability of Sam Fisher, all in a grave search to find his unknown identity.  Whether or not he does find his true credentials., what I find in this a much deeply-plotted movie that brought my attention to its qualities that, in its rarest form, make it much better than the original.  It's a BOURNE fact, moviegoers.<br /><br />It's been a while since the original took place, and an espionage objective has occurred in Berlin thanks to the people of the CIA.  Their objective backfired, though, cause someone killed the people involve in the spy mission.  Meanwhile in India, Jason and his girlfriend, Marie, were taking it easy on the simple Hindu land after their previous adventure, or are they, `cause Jason's keep having terrible dreams about his blurry past.  Sadly, the past comes back at him, as he and his girl are on the road to get away from a Russian hitman that's following them, and the hitman killed Marie and their jeep landed on a river from the bridge, presumably dead.  What the hitman didn't know is that Bourne is still alive and he's furious enough for revenge.  Too bad one objective leads to another, because Bourne's also on the run from the CIA, who thinks the one that killed the operatives in the spy mission is him.  So now he must find the enemies that tried to assassinate him while clearing his name for murder.<br /><br />A fan's way of speaking: Bourne can kick Bond's sleazy *ouch*.  This sequel really brought out more character to the main guy.  On "Identity", I see him as a kung-fu amnesiac with plenty of arsenal and essentials; I didn't see him any different that any other movie spy out there.  But in "Supremacy", he was BOURNE to be a distinct person.  Even when he lost his loved one, he didn't go off and get another one during the whole movie; he isn't a womanizer like that certain popular British agent.  Plus, he's doesn't always keep his cool.  He's remorse about the things that happen, and confused about things he doesn't understand.  With such character development,  I started to appreciate him more, and find him much favorable.<br /><br />This movie is BOURNE to be much more story-driven than it's predecessor (although I still think it's essential to watch the first movie before this).  As the plotlines builds up, "The Bourne Supremacy" will take Matt Damon in exotic continental lo-cals such as Germany, India, and Moscow.  During his busy time running away from the CIA and finding clues that would lead to the assassins` whereabouts, he treats himself with a little bit of flashback scenarios.  These scenarios play a key role in the movie, since they fill in a few gaps for Bourne's elusive past.  The story wouldn't be as engaging if people like me are expecting some action to coincide it, and there is.  I got to find out who is the fight choreographer in this movie, because I want to applaud him (or her) for having such unusual ideas to make these fighting scenes look so awesome and swift.  There's also a few B-rated car chases to add into its adrenaline mix (as if I care about those).  Okay, the action scenes aren't as well-balanced as the story, but they're still cool to watch.<br /><br />The actors here are pretty well-rounded, not to my surprise from the cold and serious Matt Damon.  Joan Allen does just as well as the CIA agent Pamela Landy who's looking for Bourne.  Julia Stiles makes her fine second appearance in the Bourne saga as Nicky, once again; too bad she doesn't have much of a role here.  If there's anything to say about the musical score, it's Moby's "Extreme Ways" during the ending credits.  The song just fits right for the intensity of the spy-thriller.  Other than that, the score's good but it sounded similar to the original.<br /><br />THE FINAL WORD: Substantial.  Simply put, "The Bourne Supremacy" brings the cake and adds some icing in it as well.  It proves so much substance, while still having the crazy style at the same time. Yep, this movie is BOURNE to attract people looking for a good spy-action movie for the summer; it has for me.  I'm starting to look forward to "The Bourne Ultimatum" in 2006!<br /><br />Note:  I don't count "The Bourne Legacy" as part of the saga, since that story was not authorized by the same guy.</p></body></html>

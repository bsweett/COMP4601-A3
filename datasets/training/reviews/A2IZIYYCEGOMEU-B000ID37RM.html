Mulligan's direction is flawless, and lovingly illuminates the Finch family, and the southern town they live in. Horton Foote's screenplay, and Elmer Berstein's expressive score capture the essence of the book marvelously. No serious film collector should be without TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.<br /><br />The interviews with the cast, and crew are also quite enlightening. It's fun to see the actors that played Scout, and Jem, grown up, and looking back on their roles.</p></body></html>

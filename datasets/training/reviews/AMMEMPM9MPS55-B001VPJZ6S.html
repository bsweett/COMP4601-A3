<meta name="summary" content="A classic of its genre"></head><body><p>The Breakfast Club is a damn enjoyable film. It stands out as a classic of its genre, the '80s teen movie, the &quot;brat pack&quot; flicks exemplified in the films of John Hughes (Ferris Bueller's Day Off). In Hughes's world, the grown-ups are exposed as morons, and here it is Paul Gleason as high school Principal Richard Vernon (&quot;Does Barry Manilow know you raided his wardrobe?&quot;) as the token object of humiliation.<p>In The Breakfast Club, five students find themselves thrown together for a Saturday detention. Throughout the course of the day they fight, they cause mischief, they laugh, they cry, they get high, and they wind up discovering that as different as they are from each other on the surface -- the rich kid, the geek, the troublemaker -- underneath they're the same ordinary kids going through the same ordinary struggles.<p>You may have to ignore some of the amoral implications of the story to appreciate it. And you will have to find it in your heart to forgive the cheesiness as Hughes presents every cliche of his era one by one. Overlook some of the utter implausibilities and absurdities the film throws at us. This is good fun that puts adults in their place for a while and reminds us that &quot;kids&quot; are human, too.</p></body></html>

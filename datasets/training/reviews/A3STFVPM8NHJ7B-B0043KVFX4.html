The movie has probably the worst editing of scenes in a horror film since Friday the 13th Part 7: the New Blood. Just when you think your going see some cool gore, it cuts away. Its a given this movie will come out unrated. I thought the movie went by fast and the story didnt seem to gel. I still enjoyed some scenes but it does seem a bit rushed. Enjoyable if you dont follow storys and want violence.</p></body></html>

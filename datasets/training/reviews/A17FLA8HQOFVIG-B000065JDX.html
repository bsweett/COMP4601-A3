<meta name="summary" content="Blood and gore and offbeat high energy.  Outrageous and wonderful!"></head><body><p>This 1996 classic is not usually my kind for film because the description included the word "vampires".  But it was starring Quentin Tarantino, George Clooney, Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis.  It was also on cable TV and was certainly worth a look-see.  Well, it sure was something different for me.  And I must say I wound up loving it.<br /><br />The film starts with George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino as a pair of bank robber brothers on the lam.  They stop by a liquor store and Quentin Tarantino brutally murders the clerk and a cop.  Immediately we see he is the demented one and throughout the film George Clooney tries to rein him in.  Well, the film gets more complicated when the brothers kidnap a family driving a mobile home and force them to sneak them over the Mexican border.  Harvey Keitel is cast as a former pastor who has lost his faith and is taking his two children, Julliette Lewis and Ernest Liu, on a vacation to Mexico.  So far, this seems like a formulaic gangster flick.<br /><br />And then the group stops at a weird and wild Mexican strip joint where Clooney and Tarantino are supposed to meet up with a connection.  This is just the beginning of a whole new aspect of this weird and wonderful film.  All the dancers are gorgeous, especially Selma Hayek who is the star of the show.  But then we find out that everyone, including all the bartenders, dancers and assorted customers are really vampires.  And that's when the film really gets creepy. The next scene seems to go on forever with blood and gore and offbeat high energy.  It is so strange that it actually becomes fun to watch.<br /><br />Perhaps I would have hated this film if it was produced by a lesser talent.  But it held me captive with its fast-paced explosive special effects.  There were times when I actually laughed out loud at its unique outrageousness.  That's why I must recommend it.</p></body></html>

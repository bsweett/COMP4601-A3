His work here completely solidifies his reputation, and I look forward to him finding more work in Hollywood. Perhaps, like with Jim Carrey, they'll build entire films around his presence which would suit this fan just fine. It sounds like they're on the road to doing so as I read he's making a movie with Johnny Depp and I know he played a character in Talladega Nights. As for Borat, it is a magnificent film and I highly recommend it; although, it certainly isn't something that you can see over and over again. Its humor is all of the "embarrassment" variety so it goes down with the jolt and thrill of a shot of Maker's Mark. You do feel very bad for the average citizen who finds his or her self unintentionally lampooned. One aspect of it I loved in particular was the interaction between Borat and his producer. With the suit and short tie he was a 100 percent sterling imitation of a Soviet Union bureaucrat. Every time I saw that guy I laughed.  I must disagree over the anti-Semitism charges as Borat's posing as an anti-Semite created the situation in which people could then speak more freely. Borat is also fun to laugh at and laughing at him also allows for the satirization of those who hold the same offensive views. We know that Jews don't run our nation or are a force of evil so it's quite natural, and healthy, to laugh at those fools who think otherwise. There's no Jew baiting here in my opinion. All there is a masterful cinematographic achievement. I can't wait for the Bruno flick to come out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="SAVAGELY PUNCHY LAMPOON THAT GETS JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING RIGHT"></head><body><p>Regardless of which 'side' of the Big Tobacco debate you are on, you have to tip your hat to the writers, creators, producers of this crackling satire. If you like your comedies crisp and caustic, you will probably get a kick out of this look at the absurd yet powerful world of corporate lobbyists.<br /><br />Rest assured, no one escapes unscathed. It takes an actor with a great deal of charm to pull off the role of a devious spin-doctor and still be likable, but Aaron Eckhart fits that to a tee. His scenes with his son are laced with such humor and dichotomous morality that they form some of the most engaging moments in the film. William Macy is always a stamp of high quality. Here, as a dogged senator with the right vision but poor debating acumen, he evokes just the right touch of sympathy and rancor.<br /><br />Whether you smoke or not, the banter is hilarious. For instance, the refrain "The beauty of an argument is that if you argue correctly you're never wrong" is probably baloney, but it is delivered with such pizazz that you nearly find yourself wanting to believe it. The script is strewn with memorable quips, but it all leads to a denouement that has its heart in the right place.<br /><br />The DVD is very satisfactory. Besides several interviews with the production team, it also contains almost a dozen deleted scenes, many of which are interesting, but one appreciates the editing effort that led to their exclusion. There's also an interesting mini-feature with the cast and crew that admits that the film should leave audiences laughing but also asking some educated questions. Oddly enough, Eckhart is the only one who sees the movie as a straight comedy and not political in its undertones.<br /><br />All in all, this one's a keeper. Get it. You'll watch it more than once.</p></body></html>

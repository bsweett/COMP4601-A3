<meta name="summary" content="Too Hurtful to Enjoy ... But Realistic ..."></head><body><p>Could you ask for better casting?! I am crazy about Vince Vaughn (truly funny) and Jennifer Antiston (immensely under-rated). Likewise, I adore the supporting-cast: Jason Bateman (such range!), Vincent D'Onofrio (a Hollywood legend!), and Justin Long (the coolest "geek" ever!) So it is easy to see why a "dream cast" to many was "wasted" in this film ...<br /><br />As noted by several reviewers here, this film should be recognized as drama with a dash of comedy. You see, I thought this piece may be akin to DeVito's "War of the Roses," which was genuinely dark and funny ... instead, Reed's work evolves from fairly amusing to downright ugly. The unfortunate aspect is that the film is crafted in such a way that the audience cannot revel in the "ugliness." Many directors create "unlikeable" characters so that the audience may enjoy their folly ... but Reed's characters are all too real. They are complex ... they reflect our own complexities ... and thus, their vicious attempts to hurt each other only succeed at making us uncomfortable. And while innovative, it is excruciating. What might be most interesting, is that the "bad decisions" lie with both sexes. I give Reed credit for clearly portraying both sexes as flawed and yet sympathetic.<br /><br />Now, I also give Reed credit for this twist on a conventional idea. It was brave to show to likable characters trapped in a bad situation ... one which many of us have experienced. I deeply wish Hollywood would make more such breaks from convention!! Nonetheless, I must admit (like other reviewers here), this film was genuinely unpleasant. It actually hurt to watch it. Of course, it must be noted, that since the film achieved such an emotional response, it actually succeeds. Still, it was difficult to watch.<br /><br />An interesting note, Reed shot a different ending from the one you will see when you purchase this film (check the IMDB trivia for this work because I do not want to spoil the film for you).  As a result of poor reception by test-audiences, it was scrapped and this new ending shot. It would be interesting to know what you think of this alternate ending. (Feel free to post your thoughts in the comments!!)<br /><br />This is a solid work. It is true to life. But it is painful. If you are in the midst of splitting from your partner or if you are newly single, it may not be the right time to watch this film. If you are a huge fan of these actors (as I am), then give this film a try ... but enter the film with the understanding that it is generally mislabeled as a comedy.</p></body></html>

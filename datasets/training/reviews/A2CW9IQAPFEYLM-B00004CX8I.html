Most of the patients are "volunteer" patients, afraid of the outside world; Nicholson shakes them up and gives them some confidence. But when he attacks the head nurse after she "psychologically" maltreats a boy, he is given shock treatment until he's just about a vegetable. The movie is a powerful blend of comedy and institutional horror; it's a tour-de-force performance for Nicholson. The movie won all 5 top Oscars. It's a great tribute to the human spirit.<br /><br />This 2-disc special edition contains an excellent documentary about the movie's creation along with other terrific extras. This is the DVD to get.</p></body></html>

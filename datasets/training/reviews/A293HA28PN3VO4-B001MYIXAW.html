<meta name="summary" content="Interesting spin on the vampire myth, not as good as I had hoped"></head><body><p>This review is for the Blu-Ray watched on a 42" Panasonic Plasma, and BD35 Player. The picture and sound are adequate, with a bit of noise in some scenes, but overall, very sharp and clear. If you're a fan of the film, the purchase is definitely worth it.<br /><br />I am a fan of "different" takes on the same story,and tend to gravitate towards slower-paced,thought provoking films. However, though I thought this film was an interesting departure from the typical vampire flick, I found the film did not provide enough detail for me, and the pace was a bit too slow. The angst of the bullied Oscar, and Eli, who is obviously tortured by her "prison" of needing blood and being isolated are effective in creating a child-based vampire film, but I felt at the end, that it would have been helpful if there was a bit more background in the special features (only contains some posters, a brief commentary).<br /><br />Though I like open ended films, and don't long for a "spoon-fed" story, this one was a bit bare boned for me. The end scene, of Oscar tapping on the box was heart breaking and predicted, perhaps, a lifetime of sadness, longing and an eventual need to turn himself, as he'd become old, and lose Eli eventually. I also liked the fact that there was not a sexual component within the vampir myth, as the main characters are children. It allowed the film maker to create a violent, yet touching journey, withou the complications of sexual undertones, which often dilute the strength and need of real character development.<br /><br />I initially attempted to watch the English dubbed version (I was not sure if the film just starred Swedish actors, who spoke English, or if it was in Swedish-I didn't want to spoil my perception of the film, by reading ANY details). But I decided to watch the film in its native language,with English subs-the dubbing, as in most dubbed films, that I've watched is hideous and comical.<br /><br />I was going to give this a 3/5, as I did not enjoy the lack of detail, and had a few minor issues with the picture and sound. However, for its originality, and courage to tackle the vampire myth through a child's eyes, I decided to give it a 4/5. Definitely worth a look-this is a story of unconditional acceptance, as the sad reality of these two characters is still based on a 12-year old's innocent perception of the world.</p></body></html>

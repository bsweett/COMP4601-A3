<meta name="summary" content="Learning the true meaning of &quot;being blown away&quot;!"></head><body><p>When &quot;Twister&quot; was released in 1996, it was panned by many film critics; but not everyone agrees.  &quot;Twister&quot; takes place in America's heartland where tornadoes are common and where residents live in fear of destruction any time a very dark cloud looms overhead.<p>The film depicts the desires of the scientist, Dr. JoAnne Thornton-Harding (Helen Hunt), to get a tornado to swallow up hundreds of sensors so that scientists can analyze their data and obtain a better understanding of tornado dynamics.  Her soon-to-be-divorced husband, William 'Bill' Harding (Bill Paxton), plans to marry a very urban psychologist, Dr. Melissa Reeves (Jami Gertz), as soon as JoAnne signs the divorce papers.  Bill brings the divorce papers out to JoAnne, but she's too busy with her sensors and the discovery of a nearby funnel cloud.  JoAnne and her crew hurry off to chase the funnel cloud with Bill &amp; Melissa along for the ride.<p>Over the course of the film, Melissa disovers what Bill really likes to do and that he still has a lot of feelings for JoAnne.  She also realizes that she hates being in very close proximity to tornadoes.<p>The special effects and constant action in the film keep the audience at the edge of their seats!<p>If you want to &quot;get blown away&quot;, this is a great film to own!</p></body></html>

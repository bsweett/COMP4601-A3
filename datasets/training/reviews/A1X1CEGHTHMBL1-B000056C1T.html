<meta name="summary" content="Forced into a war he didn't want, he looks for the man who killed his son!"></head><body><p>Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) sees the war for independence coming but he doesn't want to get involved.  It is not that he is afraid but that he has seen his fill of war and killing in the French and Indian War.  His son Gabriel Joins the Continental army and becomes a message courier.<br /><br />As the war progresses it finally comes to South Carolina and near to the home of Benjamin and his seven children.  As the family tends to injured soldiers from both sides a British Colonel has the wounded Americans shot and arrests the wounded Gabriel as a spy.  One of Gabriel's younger brothers tries to help his brother and he is shot and killed by the Colonel.<br /><br />Enraged with anger and the desire for revenge, Benjamin takes two of his sons and muskets to try to surprise attack the British and free Gabriel.  Trained in fighting the Indians, Benjamin viciously kills the British soldiers with guns, a tomahawk and a knife as he was trained to do.  He is a master in armed combat and they free his son.  The battle is very graphic.  Benjamin's sons are astonished how their mild mannered father becomes a terror on the battlefield. Twenty British soldiers are dead.<br /><br />One British soldier escapes and he tells the British Colonel that they were attacked by a single man who in the words of the Colonel moves like a ghost.  Faced with no choice now, Benjamin must join the army as he is a marked man for his actions.....<br /><br />This is a very good movie and every time I watch it I enjoy it.  I know that many parts of the movie are not historically correct but it is entertaining and action packed.  I have watched our DVD many times and I still like it.  I think you might like it also; it is a very entertaining movie!</p></body></html>

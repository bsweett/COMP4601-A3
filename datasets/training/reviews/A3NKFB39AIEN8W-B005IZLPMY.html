Before I get to my review I want to address the editorial review on this page, which said that there wasn't a link from the period this story takes place to the future when Captain America is part, or leader, of the Avengers. That reviewer evidently did not see the very first and very last scenes in the film, which explain the process by which Captain America is frozen, then thawed in the future.<br /><br />Anyway (sorry for the spoiler but I had to get that out the way because I don't think it was fair of the reviewer to overlook these scenes), I confess that it's been a very long time since I had such a good time on a superhero film. The reason I enjoyed this film is because, for one of the rare times with these types of films, its human elements didn't take a back seat to the special effects. In fact, it was the other way around. The acting was very good as was the story, as believable as a story so preposterous as its presented, can be.<br /><br />Basically, the story takes place during WW2 and a rogue general in one of Hitler's divisions called Hydra has acquired an ancient energy source that has enabled him to construct the ultimate weapon. The only hope for the Western axis is to develop "super soldiers" starting with a short pencil-neck recruit named Steve Rogers who volunteers to be a guinea pig that will amplify both his physical and also his moral attributes.<br /><br />This is one very good film, far and away the fourth best superhero this decade behind Batman Begins, the Dark Knight, and Spider Man. They really took time getting into character development, it wasn't just Wham-Bam-Thank-You-Ma'am straight to the action, but there was a real story here and not just enough to justify special effects later on. I really appreciate the film's attempt to recreate that era, to make the film feel alien enough for me to believe that it happened in another time. As usual, both Hugo Weaving and Tommy Lee Jones were terrific, Weaving as the Red Skull, and Tommy Lee as the hard-bitten military guy. Like I said, this film is more story than action even though the action and cgi effects are very good in this film, and always feel appropriate for the situations in which they are used. I like the sepia look of the human parts of the movie and how this look contrasts with the scenes showing Captain America doing his thing. This is a great primer for next year's Avengers film and I hope that the creative team who put together Captain plays a part in that film. Must see.</p></body></html>

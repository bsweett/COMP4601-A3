<meta name="summary" content="EXCEPTIONALLY THRILLING"></head><body><p>If after viewing the weirdest videotape of your life you got an anonymous phone call telling you that you'd be dead in a week, would you believe it?  If you saw this movie first, you very well might. Scary, mysterious, and engrossing, "The Ring" succeeds because it eschews so many staples of modern horror (nudity and wanton sex, gratuitous gore, killers who can't stop spouting one-liners, etc.) in favor of an original plot, careful characterization, and a creepy, believable atmosphere.  Tautly written and seamlessly directed with a standout performance by charismatic Naomi Watts as the benighted lead, "The Ring" is everything most horror films are not.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A fun tribute to rock, but the children make the movie"></head><body><p>One of the first things that struck me about School of Rock is how refreshing and totally original the movie is. Casting Jack Black was also a wise choice as he's perfectly suited to the kind of over-the-top characterization that the role demands. The film is an ode to rock music, while also emphasizing that one must never give up on one's dreams. Dewey Finn (Jack Black) is a dreamer, but he's also a washed-up and self-confessed looser who has only one goal in life, and that is to become a rock-and-roll superstar.<br /><br />Things, however, aren't going very well for Dewey - he's fired as the lead singer of a second rate rock band, and his pussy-whipped roommate Ned Schneebly (Mike White) - along with Ned's angry, snotty nosed girl friend - are hounding him to come up with some rent money. In desperation, Dewey finds himself posing as Ned and going to work as a fifth grade class substitute teacher at Horace Green Prep. School. Of course, Dewey has no teaching experience, but that hardly matters, because when he overhears his students' in music class, he rapidly elects them as his new band and turns each class into a secret rehearsal session leading up to a Battle of the Bands competition. Dewey gradually befriends the kids and teaches them lots of valuable lessons<br /><br />The movie flies along and comical situations abound, as Dewey must play "being teacher," while also trying to keep his new band a secret from the anxious school principal Rosalie Mullins (played with comic sparkle by Joan Cusack), from the children's snooty parents, and from the other teachers. The children are an absolute delight and each of them brings their own individuality to the film. There's also much fun to be had as they form the marvelously winning bond with Dewey. The children are the highlight of the movie and are probably the most natural and likable young ensembles in film memory: Miranda Cosgrove is totally irascible as band manager Summer, Joey Gaydos is cute as lead guitarist Zack, Kevin Clark is suitably spunky as drummer Freddy, Rebecca Brown is adorable as bass player Katie, and Brian Falduto absolutely riotous as the effeminate band stylist Billy. Although Jack Black's energy and antics do get a little tiresome after awhile, there is still much to enjoy in this enjoyable comic tribute to "old time rock and roll."

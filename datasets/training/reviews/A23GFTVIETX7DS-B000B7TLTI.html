<meta name="summary" content="Super Heroes Meet Suburbia"></head><body><p>I was completely unprepared to like this computer-animated film.  A smart, witty script, excellent animation by Pixar, and the talented voices of Holly Hunter, Craig T. Nelson, Samuel L. Jackson, and filmmaker Brad Bird have combined to create a winner that both kids and adults will appreciate, albeit on different levels.  Mr. Incredible (Nelson) loves saving the world, even though he likens it to cleaning a room only to turn around and find it messy again.  His soon-to-be wife Elastigirl (Hunter) is just as tough in her pursuit of justice, and often comes to her beloved's rescue.  The city is full of super heroes who do the work of police and who receive thunderous applause after their life-saving exploits.  Unfortunately for the super heroes, their glory days fade in a hail of lawsuits (people don't want to be saved and others use their injuries while in peril against the super heroes), and so all those with superpowers must enter normal life in a kind of witness-protection program.  The Incredibles, now with three children, face a mundane life as Bob/Mr. Incredible supports the family with an insurance adjuster job, and Helen/Elastigirl struggles to stop sibling squabbles.  Helen and Bob have become archetypal suburban parents, arguing about the kids and chores.  Bob and his friend Frozone (Jackson) long for the good old days when they felt like real men.  When Bob blows his cover, he is recruited by the mysterious Mirage (Elizabeth Pena) for some top secret superhero work.  Of course, Helen knows nothing about it--she's too busy dealing with baby Jack Jack, risk-taking Dash, and reclusive teenager Violet.  Predictably, Bob gets into trouble, and Helen has no choice but to don her old costume.  Fashion designer Edna (Bird) gives the Incredibles both the push and the pizzazz they need to reclaim their rightful spots as superheroes.<br /><br />The strength of this movie is the action-packed plot coupled with witty satire about contemporary American life.  Like all aging suburbanites, the Incredibles have developed beer guts (Bob) and wide hips (Helen).  They argue about issues that couples argue about everywhere, from financial concerns to not taking asked-for advice to ignoring the needs of the other.  The young Helen is a feminist who refuses to leave saving the world "to the men," but she becomes a stay-at-home mom who shuttles the kids to and from school, cooks family dinners, and finds herself responsible for almost all of the kids' upbringing.  The young Bob revels in his prowess, but in middle age he is beaten down by bureaucracy and a junky car.  Small details, such as the "graduation" between fourth and fifth grade and the way lawsuits twist the truth, make these otherwise extraordinary people ordinary.<br /><br />This sharp-witted adventure movie will delight both kids and adults.  The hilarious extra "Jack Jack Attack" should not be missed, especially since it fills in some details referred to in the movie itself.  Buy or rent this movie - and prepare yourself for some real entertainment.</p></body></html>

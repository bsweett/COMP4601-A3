<meta name="summary" content="Very well done if predictable"></head><body><p>It is somewhat amusing to read some of the criticisms of the movie on here.... some criticize Eastwood's "Right Wing Conservative politics" in the film, while just as many complain that he is pushing "liberal values"... makes you wonder how many people still form their own opinions and views on things today and how many are simply programmed by the media to express the views they have.<br /><br />The film was well done overall despite it's predictability and overshadows of "Shawshank Redemption" stylization.<br /><br />In fact is it interesting to see the same formula Clint has used in his last 5 films.... he has a certain 5-point formula he has used identically in Unforgiven and all his other recent films.<br /><br />But it is a formula that works for him.<br /><br />This is worth seeing but it not the sort of DVD I would add to my collection to watch over and over again.</p></body></html>

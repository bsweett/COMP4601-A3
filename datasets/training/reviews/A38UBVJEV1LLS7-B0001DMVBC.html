The fact is that these movies feel like they were created with the soul purpose of winning Oscars thus a lot of the magic falls deaf on the viewer. I approached "House of Sand and Fog" with this same mentality, expecting a good acting job, but a boring film; however, I am happy to report that this stereotype fell flat on its face. I have never read the book and so I did not know what to expect, but what I got was twist after twist that took me on a whirlwind flight of beauty and pain. At first, the movie seemed a little silly (how Jennifer's character behaved was a little over the top and selfish) and boring, but it morphed into a simply magnificent tale of love and loss. The really great thing though was the plot twist that occurred and how the story throws one back and forth (do I love this character or hate him/her).  It is not until the end that one can even begin to digest what has happened.  <p>Not only was the storyline fantastic, but the acting was phenomenal! Jennifer and Ben were simply fantastic, but the real "show stealer" was newcomer Shohreh Aghdashloo; oh my she was so wonderful and heartbreaking. By the end I can promise that you will cry (at least inside) more than you ever have for a movie; the people seem so real and personal to you (every one of them). I am absolutely appalled that this film did not pick up a single Oscar and very few nominations!<p>This film is a wonderful Drama and so much more. I have never been so drawn in by a cast and story before. I would recommend this to any "Art" loving individual that appreciates the fragileness of life and the human spirit. I do not usually write long reviews but this film deserves pages and pages of praise. Just watch and you will understand that the hype is well deserved.</p></body></html>

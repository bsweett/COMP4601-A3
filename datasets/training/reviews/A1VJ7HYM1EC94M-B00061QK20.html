<meta name="summary" content="Hero has it all"></head><body><p>This is a movie that hits you on every possible level, emotionally, visually, aurally - nearly every sense is engaged.<br /><br />Rarely has a director's use of color to capture and frame action and emotion succeeded as magnificently as does Yimou Zhang in "Hero."  Told through a sequence of four strongly defined acts within a framing device of narrative sequences between the King of Qin (Daoming Chen) and Nameless (Jet Li) each act presents a different spin on how Nameless (Hero) conquered the three most feared would be assassins of the King, becoming the only man garnering trust and honor enough to come within 10 paces of the fearful of his life ruler.  Zhang imbues each act with a distinctive and explosive yet marvelously controlled palette:  Red, White, Blue, and Green, each setting the emotional tone, advancing the physical drama, the resultant effect a marvelous achievement combining art and action.<br /><br />As stunning as Hero is visually as a story its actors must pull their own and here Zhang is blessed with an ensemble up to the difficult challenges presented them in a deceptively simple tale.  I cannot praise highly enough the work each brings to the film lending even further to the feeling of luxuriousness Zhang has imparted into every frame.<br /><br />Throughout its four Rashomon-like sequences, each actor takes on divergent motivations to achieve their actions altering personalities while simultaneously maintaining the centrality essential to their established characters. In this regard, Tony Leung Chiu Wai (Broken Arrow), Maggie Cheung (Flying Snow), and Ziyi Zhang (Moon), with Messrs. Lee and Chen present a formidable acting ensemble.<br /><br />Greater challenge is given to each as Hero, necessarily offers little opportunity exists for traditional character development.  In spite of that challenge Zhang's cast exceeds every imposed limitation and create fascinatingly complex characters who become easy to care for as they go about the business of breaking our hearts.<br /><br />As deeply felt - and as integral - as the emotional content, Hero's action sequences are executed with a combination of old world bravado and new age technology that is - quite literally - breathtaking.  The scenes of Qin's army -thousands of them - in battle, marching or surrounding the palace, is overwhelming in its sheer manpower.<br /><br />Hand-to-hand combats, with their Shaolin priest inspired feats of flying up walls, atop lakes or through the air are nothing short of spectacular, their stylized violent images ravishing and the most beautiful in an already staggeringly striking film.<br /><br />Entwined throughout is a nationalistic tale of disparate warring factions unifying to become one China.  Unfortunately many have misconstrued the film's message comparing sublimation and sacrifice of individual will for the greater good, with Hitler's plan for a master race.  Nothing could be further from truth and spirit of this remarkable film.<br /><br />p.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sinatra and Frankenheimer's nightmare"></head><body><p>Hard to believe that at the time of it's release that this film's premise was judged to be implausible. As time passes many of this film's ideas have proven to be true.  I have seen the remake with Denzil Washington & Meryl Streep and despite their efforts and Jonathan Demme's skilled direction, they can't hold a candle to this paranoid classic!!  Sinatra has never had a finer role than this and this cements his status as one of the best screen actors of all time!! Laurence Harvey may not have been a great actor since many critics have judged him to be very wooden yet this will probably remain the role he will best be remembered for. As for Angela Lansbury, her Oscar nominated performance as the wicked Mother of Harvey clearly outshines Streep's interpretation of the role.  The only fly in the ointment I find with this film is Italian/Spanish Henry Silva as an evil Mongolian--Hollywood has done it again!!  But this carp aside, this film along with "Seven Days in May" and "Black Sunday" will rank among John Frankenheimer's achievements as a great director.</p></body></html>

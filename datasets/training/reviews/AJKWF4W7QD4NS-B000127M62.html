After spending over a decade in development hell and set to be handled by a handful of different writers and directors; New Line finally managed to set a release for the film.  The story surprisingly manages to combine both Freddy and Jason's stories, and director Ronny Yu (Bride of Chucky) covers the film with a surprising heaping amount of blood and gore.  Freddy (Robert Englund, more lively in the role than ever before), trapped in Hell, manages to use mindless killer Jason to hack up and instill fear in the kids on Elm Street so he can pick up his old hobby.  Eventually, the two slashers face off in a battle that all of us already know how it will end.  Ken Kirzinger is bland as Jason; Kane Hodder was undoubtadly the best actor to ever don the hockey mask and his absence is very missed.  The rest of the cast, which includes the comely Monica Keena, Destiny's Child Kelly Rowland, and Jason "son of John" Ritter all breeze through the film with no problem.  The special effects and makeup and gore are almost top notch, although some of the CGI is incredibly lame.  All that aside though, Freddy VS Jason is definitely worth seeing for longtime horror buffs of both franchises, although many might not enjoy it as much as others.  New Line's Platinum Series DVD is yet another special features packed set from New Line, and is a definite must own for afficiandos of both series'.</p></body></html>

A Thought<br />Provoking , Moving , And Really Sad Story Of Three Childhood<br />Friends , And A Murder That Brings Them Back Together<br />Twenty Five Years Later. It Begins With Dave , Jimmy , And<br />Sean Playing Stick Ball In Their Neighborhood When Two Guys<br />Show Up And Dave Gets In Their Car. They Were Writing Their<br />Names In Wet Cement And Dave Never Finished Writing His<br />Name. It Goes To Twenty Five Years Later. Jimmy Is A Father<br />Who's Daughter Has Been Murdered. Sean Is A State Trooper<br />That Has To Investigate The Murder. Dave Is A Prime Suspect.<br />This Movie Is Unpredictable And Allot Better Than The Book<br />Which Was Excellent Also.  A Marvelous Movie That Everyone<br />Should See.</p></body></html>

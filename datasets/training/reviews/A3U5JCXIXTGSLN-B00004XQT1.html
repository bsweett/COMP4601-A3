<meta name="summary" content="This Film Does the Book Justice"></head><body><p>I read "American Psycho" before I saw the movie and I'm very glad I did. My reading the book prepared me for the disturbing images I would ultimately see on the screen. Christian Bale did an excellent job of portraying the monstrous yet calm Patrick Bateman in a story that takes place in the 1980s.<p>The story mainly revolves around a man in his twenties who is very successful on Wall Street in New York City. He seems very charming and normal to just about all who meet him - he even has a fiance played very well by Reese Witherspoon. However, what these people don't know is that under that charming exterior lies a vicious killer who must satisfy his need to kill whenever the mood strikes. Even though he does possess the traits of a killer, there are also some lighter scenes in the movie. The scene where Patrick and his co-workers discuss their business cards will bring a smile to your face. It's amazing how the type of paper or ink used on a card can be so important and almost seem life-threatening to these men. Their entire level of status rested upon a small card.<p>You will probably find yourself in shock throughout most of the film, but sometimes that can be a good thing. This is not a regular film that one goes to see for enjoyment. This film was made to make you feel uncomfortable and make you take a serious look at the sort of things that go on in the world everyday. The ending will have you second-guessing yourself and make you think, "How did that happen?" This movie is not for the faint of heart, but if you think you are up to challenge of watching this film, I'd recommend it!</p></body></html>

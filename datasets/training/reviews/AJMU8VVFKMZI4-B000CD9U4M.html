I remember over a decade ago when I shared that thought with some movie friends and was literally laughed at, now it's an accepted fact. Woo hoo for me.  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is just another shiny example of the risks Johnny is willing to take to bring us unique characters and one of the things about this film I like is his total committment to his performance.  Course there was something inconsistent about an arrested developed man seeming to not like children.  Given his history with his father, I could understand him not liking parents, but in the movie, he really seemed to get along with them better.  Still a good Michael Jackson impersonation.  And for that I say Bravo.  The other great things about this the movie are the wonderful sets for Willy Wonka's extraordianry chocolate factory.  They are literally eye candy for the movie audience.  But as a whole, I can't say that I was blown away by this movie.  In fact, there are portions of the movie where I was bored and was entertaining doing a few house chores instead--and I HATE chores.  Anyway, this goes to show that sometimes even great performances can't save a movie.  Overall: watch at your own risk.</p></body></html>

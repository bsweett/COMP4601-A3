<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie But..."></head><body><p>I have to be honest. This movie was great, full of action and just enough drama to keep it the tragic story it is supposed to be. One of the better historical films I have witnessed...but there is a problem. This story was supposed to be more centered on the two lovers, Paris and Helen, and it wasn't. No they centered more on Achilles, Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt is the bigger actor, so they of course wanted him to stay in the spotlight, and Brad Pitt did very well as Achilles. But I felt they should have made the situation between Paris and Helen more in the center of everything, since they are the ones who started this whole story. You see a lot more of Achilles and Hector though than Paris and Helen, and although like I said it makes it a very fascinating film, I still have to shave off a star because one of the things I wanted to see more of was this Paris and Helen situation more strongly than it was. Matter of fact they strengthened more on the relationship of Achilles and his eventual lover in the film than Paris and Helen.<br />Yet I cannot hate this film. It was as I said exciting and the characters that played this film supported the movie. It is definitely one of the better films I have seen historically and I love how they played out the movie. I just wish they would have stayed focused a little better on Paris and Helen. Yet Brad Pitt made it a film to enjoy with him as the centerfold.<br /><br />I recommend this film over Gladiator, King Arthur, and Alexander. Troy is a lot more exciting of a film than any of these others. That's my opinion at least.</p></body></html>

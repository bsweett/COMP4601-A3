<meta name="summary" content="Revenge is so sweet..."></head><body><p>A very good film, Lucky Number Slevin, brings to the screen the story of an out-of-towner visiting his friend in New York who is brought before two powerful gangsters to whom he apparently owes money.  A case of mistaken identity or is there more than meets the eye?<br /><br />Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Lucy Liu (gorgeous as always!), Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Stanley Tucci and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, Lucky Number Slevin is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! 4.5 Stars</p></body></html>

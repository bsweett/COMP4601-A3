Just when you started to root for a character they would do something so base and digusting you would just sit there in shock.  The dialoge is great, thanks to this being an acclaimed stage production, the performances are good, Clive Owen the stand out, he was exceptional.  Im really not sure id recommend this movie, it's so depressing, and what it says about these four losers is not pretty, but on the other hand the performances are good, the dialoge well written and i liked the fact is is shot on location in London...really up to you, but be prepared to be very frustated, these four are idiots of the highest order and deserve each other, I really hate to think that anyone could be as horrible as any of these four.</p></body></html>

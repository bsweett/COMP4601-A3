<meta name="summary" content="excellent (4.6/5)"></head><body><p>i remember watching this film eons ago,and thinking it was horrible.in fact,i even fell asleep while watching it.however,i decided to revisit it a few days ago and had the exact opposite reaction.this time,i thought it was brilliant.i thought the story flowed perfectly,and the tension mounted at just the right tempo and hung there until the very end.the acting was spot on.and the music added the perfect atmosphere.i haven't seen too many Ron Howard film's,but this is one of the best that i have seen of his.i would encourage anyone who hasn't seen it to check it out.who knows,you might be surprised,for me Apollo 13 is a 4.6/5</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Easily one of the most significant films of the past decade"></head><body><p>The year is 1994. The country of Rwanda is experiencing the beginning of a brutal civil war between the Hutu and the Tutsi. When the notorious Rwandan Genocide has commenced, a hotel manager named Paul Rusesabagina (played brilliantly by Don Cheadle) provides shelter for his own family and friends, as well as a thousand refugees who are trying to protecting themselves from harm. At this time, Paul does all he can to protect everyone from fear, famine, and the militia.<br /><br />Since this is based on a true story, you already know that it's going to be brutally disturbing. Hotel Rwanda is a very powerful film that touches on hate, violence, and political corruption. It also focuses on family matters and, to some extent, the American media. Those who have weak stomachs will have to be warned: this is a completely solemn piece of work that's grounded in hard-hitting realism. It's not as violent as Schindler's List or Full Metal Jacket, but it's the drama and realism that makes it so gut-wrenching. And it's not only the drama that makes this film so endearing: Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, and Joaquin Phoenix give very convincing performances.<br /><br />Hotel Rwanda is an excellent and unforgettable film that is quite effective due to the story being true. It's strong, it's unsettling, it's humorless, but most of all, it's important. This is easily one of the best films of 2004, and one of the best of the 2000's.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></body></html>

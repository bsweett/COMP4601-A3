<meta name="summary" content="Complex Dull Emotional Tale"></head><body><p>"The Good Shepherd" seems to refer to the CIA, as a Christ-like agency that watches over his sheep.  Matt Damon plays a CIA agent, with flashbacks of his life.  Most of the action is set in the 1960's, however, the film hops back and forth in time.  The first flashback is his father's suicide and him hiding the suicide note, taking the blame for accidently killing his father.  He did not want his mother to know his father took his own life.  The movie meanders through his life and loves, with little emotional punch or interest.  After watching about thirty minutes, you realize it is not a thriller, or even very interesting.  The whole movie runs about three hours and is just boring, complicated and amazing that a man can go through life with his mouth shut, yet realizing you cannot "erase" mistakes, and mistakes can be big.  Top-rate actors like Damon, DeNiro, Jolie, and many others promise a epic film, but somehow there is no interesing hook.  The ending shows Matt reading his father's suicide note, as he kept and hid it for decades.  Even that ending was not satisfying.  The movie wants to relay a deep and important story, but it can't find the keynote to make this leap.</p></body></html>

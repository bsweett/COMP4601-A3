<meta name="summary" content="Some Can't Grasp Artistry Of Casablanca"></head><body><p>One of the most famous movies of all time, and one of the best, Casablanca is set during WWII, in neutral Morocco. Its action centers around Rick, a no-nonsense nightclub manager who was once attracted to Ilsa. When she reenters his life and requests his help, he must confront his &quot;I stick out my neck for nobody&quot; mentality and step up. Many famous phrases and scenes abound, this movie is written perfectly, its pacing, plot and humor (yes) should serve as an example to aspiring screenwriters. There should be a copy in every household, its effects on popular culture are far-reaching and long-lasting, and it is an unforgettable lesson on morals and self-discovery. If you haven't seen this part of America's cultural lexicon, rent or buy it today.</p></body></html>

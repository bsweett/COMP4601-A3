The gore level is the highest I've encountered in some time and at the risk of offending the Fangoria subscribers, which are legion, is gratuitous beyond words. It's not that I was either offended or disgusted by anything I saw, but I was, however, taken aback by the excessiveness of it all. The clever dismemberment quotient was taken to an all time high, with everything from spring board heads tethered to the body by a strand of flesh, to the drawbridge decapitation, to the silhouetted arm given the human wish bone treatment, to the countless zombie crushing's all courtesy of Dead Reckoning, etc.<br /><br />At first it's nostalgic and one hour later it's just plain irritating. Something working in the film's favor is the idea of the evolution of the zombies from shuffling, mindless, eating machines, to beings with a sense of recall and memory and developing motor skills and something working against it was the lead zombie's constant howling-as-command; that was a royal misstep and in the end only manages to detract.<br /><br />Nevertheless, in the hands of a lesser experienced (and talented) director, that could have proven to be a death trap, but Mr. Romero's talents (the aforementioned howling not-with-standing) keeps it reigned in pretty tightly and doesn't allow it to become a parody of itself. Dennis Hopper is his usual wooden self (the man is incapable of registering any emotion) and the rest of the cast was seemingly into the fun of it all, especially John Leguizamo. Simon Baker was somewhat detached, but he is, after all, playing the ultimate cynic and self-preservationist. Ms. Argento, however, left me cold, alas and no amount of cleavage and tattoos can make her believable as hooker turned zombie hunter.<br /><br />The premise of the film, as a whole sort of works and the sum is, ultimately greater than its parts but it felt so restrain and needed to be more fleshed out. The characters could have elevated the film into the Romero zombie franchise. Being that this particular film was awful George Romero will still maintain his many fans others might not understand why but horror buffs will.</p></body></html>

Ed Norton is up to the task of portraying the dedicated scientist turned green giant though his acting skills are primarily delegated to running away from the pursuing military forces, staring at blood samples through a microscope or gazing longingly at love interest Liv Tyler. That's not a knock on his abilities, it's simply the limitations within the Bruce Banner role as scripted. What made the storyline a major success for me was the inclusion of Tim Roth. When you sit down and compose a list of the truly great "bad guys" in contemporary cinema he would definitely be near the top of my list.<br /><br />Aside from all that, the Hulk is a comic book superhero, so first and foremost this film by definition must focus on special effects and action sequences. In those two aspects you will not be disappointed. If you like your heroes huge, angry and green this is the film for you!</p></body></html>

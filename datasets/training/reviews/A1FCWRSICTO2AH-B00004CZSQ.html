<meta name="summary" content="The Look of Horror"></head><body><p>I could of probably lived without 10 over-the-top seconds of "Suspiria."  Those 10 seconds are graphic to the point of porn.  No doubt Argento fans would say that such scenes are what make Argento Argento.  Whatever.  That said, this is a really good movie with a terrific look.  Argento's use of colors and architecture to establish mood (dread) is simply astounding.  I have to believe Kubrick borrowed from Argento, heavily, in his making of  "The Shining."  I almost didn't finish watching "Suspiria" due to a graphic murder in the beginning.  What kept me hanging in there was the stylish way Argento was framing his scenes.  Hairy and taloned arms appearing out of the dark, a haunting run through the woods, wild and/or garish art deco interiors that have you thinking Jack the Ripper picked out the colors and patterns, and a building that looks like it was designed in Hell. <p>The plot?  It's ok.  Not as weak as some have suggested, but it does have holes - holes you don't spend much time pondering, since it's your eyes and ears Argento is after.  Acting?  Almost seems beside the point.  You have your various grotesque characters, some with very big teeth, doing evil things. Jessica Harper is, however, very good as the waif-like ballet student.  Her physical slightness, her big eyes, all contribute to the impression that she is surrounded by monstrous horror.  How will she escape? Watch and see.  The soundtrack, especially if you have surround sound, is effective and eerie. Lots of evil whisperings and other ominous sounds jump from unexpected directions. So the makers of the dvd are also to be applauded.  It's as crisp a picture as you can imagine.  (Guess Argento wanted those "reds" to really show.)</p></body></html>

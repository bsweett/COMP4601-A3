<meta name="summary" content="Tragic, Yet Somehow Inspiring"></head><body><p>Grizzly Man is the story of Timothy Treadwell, a wildlife advocate and educator, author, and environmentalist who lived among the giant grizzly bears of Kodiak island for thirteen summers. Treadwell took myriad photographs as well as documented hours of footage of the bears, red foxes, and his musings on life and nature.<br /><br />In the fall of 2003, Treadwell and his girlfriend Amie were eaten alive by an old and starving grizzly who had come in from the inland while all the bears Tim knew had already begun their hibernation. Tim and Amie had already left for the year. He returned on a whim. In the last moments of the film, it is like watching a horror movie where you yell for the characters to run. Everything screams danger: the ominous gray skies, absence of wildlife, cold winds, and this lone bear who will not look Treadwell in the face.<br /><br />The film is really worth seeing. I highly recommend it. Completely mesmerizing from start to finish, it touches your heart because of Treadwell's childlike character. As far as those reviewers who see his actions as reckless and stupid, it is because of insensitive people like them that Treadwell was driven into the wilderness. Nature is cruel, but so-called civilization is worse.<br /><br />I am surprised that no comparisons were made in the film to the 1970's series Grizzly Adams, which was based on the true story of Adams. Adams lived happily among wildlife in the Sierra Nevada in the 1850's - then prime grizzly and cougar habitat. The call of the wild is very powerful. People who at their very essence love nature want to be a part of it to some degree. In cases like Treadwell, Henry David Thoreau, Farley Mowhat (Never Cry Wolf), and Diane Fossey (Gorillas in the Mist) this love is taken to an extreme.<br /><br />As the director of Grizzly Man says, the movie can teach us about our own nature.<br /><br />To explain Treadwell's heart, here is the theme from Grizzly Adams. Hauntingly apt.<br /><br />Deep inside the forest there's a door into another land.<br />Here is our life and home.<br />We are staying here forever in the beauty of this place all alone.<br />We keep on hoping.<br />Maybe there's a world where we don't have to run.<br />Maybe there's a time we'll call our own, living free in harmony and majesty.<br />Take me home. Take me home.</p></body></html>

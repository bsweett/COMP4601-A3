<meta name="summary" content="Bridget is a naughty spinster."></head><body><p>Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason is a great follow-up to the surprise box office hit, Bridget Jones's Diary. Only Renee Zellweger can play this role, she is wickedly fabulous as larger than life Bridget. Renee looks adorable all chubby and curvy, she is too thin in real life, I like her body in these movies. The second one is just as good as the first one. Bridget gets herself arrested and still has boyfriend trouble but this time with new beau, Mark played by Colin Firth. Hugh Grant returns to his role of Daniel Cleaver, he is even a bigger wanker in this one, I love to hate him. I love the scene where Bridget thinks she is pregnant ( funny dream sequence!). The Edge of Reason is a strong sequel, I have seen a lot of sequels and this one is pretty great.</p></body></html>

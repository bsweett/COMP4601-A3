<meta name="summary" content=""I Am Legend" Is Entertaining But "The Omega Man" Is Superior"></head><body><p>Will Smith stars yet again in another film where he battles animated creatures.  First it was runaway robots in "I Robot."  Now, it's super strong mutants, products of a cancer treatment gone horribly wrong.  The bald mutants look very similar to the robots.<br /><br />  "I Am Legend" is a remake of a remake.  The original is "The Last Man on Earth."  Made in the sixties, this film most closely resembles the novel on which it was based:  Richard Matheson's  "I Am Legend."  An airborne virus kills most of the human population which return as zombie-like vampires.  Vincent Price is Dr. Neville who's lost his family to the virus and searches for a cure while killing vampires in London.<br /><br />  In the early seventies, Charlton Heston reprises the role as Dr. Neville in "The Omega Man."  Living in Las Angeles, he also searches for a cure while killing the mutants.  Those who do not die from the germ warfare are turned into psychotic albinos who are afraid of the light.<br /><br />  Of the three movie, "The Omega Man" is superior because it has the most realistic plot and the better characterization.  The mutants are three-dimensional humans; they are not cartoon characters.  Neville has more interaction with the unaffected survivors, especially one female played by feisty Rosalind Cash.  There are also more twists and turns.  It has a delicious, downbeat ending that leaves us with a faint ray of hope for mankind.<br /><br />  In "I Am Legend," Will Smith is basically a one man show; it is him versus the cartoon characters.  The interaction between him and the dog is touching and very emotional.  However, I felt more sympathy with Vincent Price's Neville who watched his family slowly die of the plague.  He even encountered his wife's return as a vampire.<br /><br />  Overall, "I Am Legend" is entertaining and suspenseful.  However, it is a disappointment for fans of the far more superior "Omega Man."  I strongly suggest that, if you liked "I Am Legend," you obtain a copy of "The Omega Man."  You may enjoy it more.  If you are a fan of classic horror and/or Vincent Price, search out a copy of "The Last Man on Earth."</p></body></html>

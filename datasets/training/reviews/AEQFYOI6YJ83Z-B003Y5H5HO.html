<meta name="summary" content="A solid, edgy thriller from one of the masters."></head><body><p>Let's face it: David Fincher's at his best when he's trying to creep us out.  He can give us a character-study drama about building an online empire (THE SOCIAL NETWORK), or a fantasy about Brad Pitt aging backwards for some reason (BENJAMIN BUTTON), but Fincher works best in the real of the thriller: SE7EN still remains (in this reviewer's opinion) his strongest, most fully-conceived film, with FIGHT CLUB and ZODIAC ranking pretty high up there.  THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO falls into this mind-freak category, with genuine thrills (even for those who've read the book and seen the original film), some solid performances, a fantastic script, incredible visuals and sound--basically, everything you've come to expect from a Fincher thriller.<br /><br />The plot is far from simple; as with the first film, this movie bogs down in the novel's convoluted story (following two protagonists, going back and forth in time, lingering on subplots that could easily have been trimmed).  It's basically the story of disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist (a subtle and engaging Daniel Craig), who is hired by billionaire Henrik Vanger (a regal Christopher Plummer, in the midst of a late-career resurgence) to solve the decades' old murder of his niece.  Along the way, Blomkvist recruits tough-but-vulnerable girl Lisabeth Salander (a very capable, occasionally surprising Rooney Mara) who has a knack for computer hacking and revenge.<br /><br />DRAGON TATTOO, for you newcomers, is basically what THE GODFATHER would have been if it were a techno-thriller-mystery.  Which probably makes no sense.  That's okay; you'll either love this film for its pseudo-gothic vibes, or hate it for its forced overtones of darkness.  One thing everyone can agree on are the performances, from the two leads to the stellar supporting cast: Robin Wright, Stellan Skarsgard, Joely Richardson, even the grossly-overlooked Julian Sands in a wordless flashback role (talk about wasted talent, but he makes the most of it).  The script, too, is top-notch; Steve Zaillan's penned everything from MONEYBALL to GANGS OF NEW YORK, and he still keeps finding new tricks up his sleeve.  Kudos must also be heaped upon Fincher's ever-reliable cohort Trent Reznor, for providing a killer soundtrack.  (Oh, and at least watch the film for the opening credits sequence; think Bond in Hell.)<br /><br />Stieg Larsson's original novel was a very well-written and engaging tome, if a bit overlong and meandering (it could have been half its length and still been okay); the American film version trims the fat a little (it's still over 2.5 hours long), but falls to many of the same inconsistencies.  Why, then, the five stars?  Because of the way Fincher and company overcome the challenges.  It's not a crime classic in the way that SE7EN is, and probably never will be.  But there's a lot here to love (or hate, as many will, for a wide variety of reasons, many of them legitimate), and for Fincher's growing legions of fans, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO will go down as a particular favorite.</p></body></html>

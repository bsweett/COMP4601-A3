<meta name="summary" content="CLUTZY CLOUSEAU RETURNS"></head><body><p>This movie is hilarious, and I had a good time with it.  One needs to remember this is a different Clouseau; Steve Martin was born to play the inept but efficient French inspector.  Peter Sellers was of course a marvelous Clouseau, but do yourself a favor.  Don't compare.  Martin is just as funny, and he's supported by a great cast and a humorous storyline.<br /><br />This time the pink panther jewel is set in a ring worn by bombastic soccer coach Jason Stratham (in an uncredited cameo), which he gives to his fiancee, pop star Beyonce Knowles.  Shortly thereafter Stratham is killed by a Chinese poison dart.  Snooty Kevin Kline (in Herbert Lom's role) sets Clouseau up so he can solve the case on the sly.  He assigns Jean Reno to be his partner and to snitch on Clouseau's activities too.  Reno, usually playing dead serious roles, is a hoot and the scene where he and Clouseau disguised as wallpaper have to prove they are really Knowles' backup dancers is priceless.  Emily Mortimer (so good in DEAR FRANKIE) plays love smitten Nicole, Clouseau's brainy assistant, and she is good too.  PINK PANTHER has tons of sight gags, some of which don't always work, but this movie is purely fun entertainment.</p></body></html>

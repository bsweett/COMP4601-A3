<meta name="summary" content="Doomsday"></head><body><p>I had given up on Stephen King adaptions. But I have to say, this movie was great. It leaves you with a feeling of dread. The huge monster walking over the truck at the end was just terrifying and inspired such a feeling of Armegeddon and Apocalypse. There is no happy ending here. You will leave the cinema very disturbed by this movie.<br />I was trying to figure out if it really was Armegeddon as told in the Bible, or if it was government experimentation gone wrong. The film depicts events as told in the book of Revelations about the end of the world. You will be guessing right up to the end.</p></body></html>

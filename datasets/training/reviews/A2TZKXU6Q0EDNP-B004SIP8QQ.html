<meta name="summary" content="4.5 hours of celluloid for this??"></head><body><p>I can only wonder...First we get Kill Bill 1, which was simply a flashier version of 70's karate flicks with loadsa fake blood and gore for extra effect, and then when we're supposed to see the whole plot come theoretically together in Kill Bill 2, we get a film that drags itself painfully for 2.5 hours and bores you to tears.<p>  Remember, this is Tarantino we're talking about, the director who with brilliant dialogues in Pulp Fiction and Reservoir dogs, not only established himself but recreated a stale genre from scratch. But, speaking of dialogues, it's been a long while since I've seen a film with more inane and ultraboring dialogues as in Kill Bill 2.<p>  Supposedly, once the "Bride", finally gets to "Bill" we should have the set-up for a tremendous climax. Instead, Bill and Uma sit it out, and start chatting merrily away, making us witnesses of a conversation equal in interest to early hours political talk shows. Tarantino attempts to put together a plot that has twists (ohhhhh, so Bill was Uma's ex!!! wow, how unbelievably interesting) but those "twists" would make even sophomore script writers fall asleep.<br />  And as for climax??? After Uma has gone through of hordes of kung-fu chopping thugs in Kill Bill 1, she finally meets the "Man", the "Boss", and what do we get? She puts him away with the ridiculous  "5 finger palm technique"? Mercy, mercy me..<p>  Alltogether, the ending of KB2, and specifically the last 30-40 minutes of it, has got to be one of the cheesiest, boringiest and draggiest endings i've seen in a long while. I was begging for the film to end no matter how. I was even more begging for them to stop talking the utter nonsense coming out both the characters' mouths...But my prares were answered...<p>  Before that, there was the momumental fight between Uma and Hanna, which served as one major highlight of the film and the other character, the Chinese kung fu master who was probably the most original character in both installments. But he only got (bizzarely) only 10 minutes of presence in the film, only to give his place to mega-bore Bill.<p>  Then there was the sequence with Uma digging herself out of 10 feet of dirt if not more. We are shown a  guy, who even uses a ladder (!!!) to climb out of the grave he's dug for Uma, and yet Uma, oh wonders, not only punches her way out of the coffin, but needs no assistance climbing out, because, oh wonders again, the grave has now become miraculously shallower????????? Puhlease....<p>  Such incredible plot jokes, were also in abundance in KB1, so i wasnt very much surprised to see Tarantino butchering his own script in the second part. <p>  But when it comes to surprises, i'll say this: i went to see the Kill Bill films very positively biased, being both a massive fan of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir dogs, both of which i consider classic films. But i kept in mind, that the last 2 films Tarantino offered us, were the highly forgettable "Jackie Brown" (yeah, anyone remember STILL that one? of course not) and the only at-moments-good but otherwise also forgettable "Four Rooms". And i wondered whether with "Kill Bill" Tarantino would shine again.<p>  I was dissapointed. Not so much becuase i didn't like the Kill Bill" flicks, but because I'm now heavily suspecting that Tarantino might never deliver a film of the high caliber of the 'Dogs and Pulp Fiction. And that is even sadder than the fact that Kill Bill was overall golden mediocrity with a ton of hype.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Boring, by-the-numbers war movie"></head><body><p>This is another proof (if one was still needed) tha Oscar is like politcs, but worse. This insane amount of awards for such a pedestrian war movie? Heck, "PLATOON" blows this out of the water anytime, even watching it today. Saving Private Ryan, same thing. I could mention a lot of others (Black Hawk Down; Cross of Iron).<br /><br />Direction is sloppy; acting is average. Photography is so-and-so. A lot of war movies managed to show the conflict, tensions, pscilogical doubts AND the action much better.<br /><br />Maybe they simply did not want AVATAR to gather all the awards (I'm not saying it did deserve it or not; I'm just guessing); maybe they wanted a female director to get it (no prejudice here-just analysing the statistics).<br /><br />Highly disappointing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="mediocre at best"></head><body><p>Its a mediocre film based on a mediocre idea turned into a mediocre script. Harrison Ford does not age gracefully, and the ending left me choking with laughter. If you live alone, have chickenpox, have seen every movie and read every book in the house, see this movie rather than die of boredom. Otherwise, don't, cuz there are better ways to spend 2 precious hours of your life.</p></body></html>

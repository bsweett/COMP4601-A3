<meta name="summary" content="A Worthy Sequel, With Pluses and Minuses Compared To The Original"></head><body><p>When you have a formula or gimmick movie, sequels make it hard for themselves to live up to the original and maintain creativity.  When the movie is based on characters and their development, it is easier to have a successful series.  Star Wars is one example of this; James Bond also avoided a set pattern.  The X-Men series is another example.<br /><br />As in the rest of the series, the theme is dealing with prejudice.  This movie has the most chilling human villain Col. William Stryker (Brian Cox), who creates a crisis for the purpose of achieving his ultimate goal:  ridding the earth of all mutants.  The good guy mutants and the bad guy mutants unite to save the mutants, but Magneto is just as ready to destroy all humans as Stryker is to destroy all mutants.  It is up to the X-Men to save the day.<br /><br />This movie gives fleeting glimpses of several of the characters, giving Pyro more of a role, while giving a brief scene with Kitty passing through walls.  It also gives a short introduction to Cyclops and Banshee.  The main new character is one of my two favorites, Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming, doing a wonderful job).  (My other favorite, The Beast, has to wait to Part 3.)<br /><br />I found this movie more exciting than the first.  However, it had a few scenes I found unnecessary, including a couple of PG-13 rated sex scenes.  I'm also uncomfortable with men fighting women, which happened in both scenes, including a lengthy battle between Jackman's Wolverine and a woman.  As a result, I would not recommend this movie as highly as the first and the third.  But that is personal preference.<br /><br />I am hesitant to give much details, but I found some similarity between this movie and Star Trek 2:  The Wrath Of Khan.</p></body></html>

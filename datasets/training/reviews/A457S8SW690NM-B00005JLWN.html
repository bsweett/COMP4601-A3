<meta name="summary" content="Vastly superior to the Matrix!!!!!!"></head><body><p>Equilibrium is a movie that follows in the footsteps of the Matrix, yet is better than its predecessor in every possible way. The acting is excellent notably by Christian Bale, who isa much better actor than Keannu Reeves. Bale should have been Neo. It would have been a much better movie. The plot of Equilibrium is better and the fights are even better! The plot of this movie is thought provoking, very original and very memorable. The movie is set in the future in a very change world after World War III. In this future, feelings of any kind are outlawed as are objects that provoke feelings. Everyone injects themselves so that they never feel. Christian Bale plays a cop that finds sense offenders and arrests them. But this world is depressing and weird. Christian Bale's character can't take it anymore and becomes the leader of the rebellion against this world.<br /><br />The movie is very moving and interesting, and the fight scenes are absolutely amazing. The final fight is AWESOME and very memorable!<br /><br />This movie is worth a buy thanks to the amazing fights and the memoralbe story! This movie IS better than the Matrix in every possible way and I strongly recommend it to anyone wanting to watch a good action/ sci fi movie. It has some of the most memorable fighting scenes ever and everything just seems to click in this awesome movie.</p></body></html>

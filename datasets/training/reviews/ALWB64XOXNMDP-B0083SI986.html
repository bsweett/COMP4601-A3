<meta name="summary" content="A Distinctive Film in the Eastwood Tradition"></head><body><p>Unlike many of the Dirty Harry films this one is poinant and real.  The character Eastwood portrays as a former auto worker was very much like my grandfather.  His values are tested when someone attempts to finish his new neighbors.  I have to reccomend this one because we get to see a sensitivity that Eastwood ever revealed to his viewers in a long time. If your expecting Dirty Harry, look out, it's far different than I'd ever thought it'd be.  An excellent contender for an Oscar. If you can buy this one.  You'll want to watch it more than once.</p></body></html>

Opening sequence is very distasteful but the story settles down as the police probe into a murder swings into high gear. Acting is uniformly great and Director Clint Eastwood has an ocean of emotion to work from. The final resolution though, seems unlikely and why did the Massachusettes FBI, and not the City Police work on this case?</p></body></html>

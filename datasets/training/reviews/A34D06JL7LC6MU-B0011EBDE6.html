<meta name="summary" content="A Great Release of a Good Film, Courtesy of The Criterion Collection"></head><body><p>The Darjeeling Limited is Wes Anderson's fifth film as a director and his fifth film to enter the Criterion Collection. Like all of Anderson's films, some may instantly fall in love with it while others will be rendered perplexed by what the hype is about. I fall somewhere in the middle of those, despite the fact that I consider myself a fan of Wes Anderson having liked all of his movies and having a certain fondness for his quirky, minimalist style. With that said, I'm polarized by The Darjeeling Limited as there's so much to like about it and little that I actually do.<br /><br />The film follows Francis (Owen Wilson), Paul (Adrien Brody), and Jack (Jason Schwartzman, also a co-writer), three brothers who haven't spoken in the year following their father's death. They meet each other on the Darjeeling Limited, a train traveling through India.<br /><br />There is a plot, but not much actually happens in the film. It progresses with the character's, who ride atop Anderson's style like a wave. The plot isn't the film's focal point; it's about character, tone, and style. Anderson has been criticized for valuing style over substance in the past, but this is one of the only films I've seen by the man where I felt compelled to use that criticism. While this is all perception as there are established relationships and/or scenes that may connect with someone on an emotional level, for me, The Darjeeling Limited never transcends something that's dryly humorous and pretty to look at.<br /><br />It's a colorful film that's vibrant, alive, and fun to look at. It uses India as the landscape, but it isn't India so much as it is Anderson's India. The art direction is splendid and transforms India into a world of whimsical fantasy. It's also blessed with brilliant cinematography by Robert Yeoman, who seems to treat each scene like a separate photograph. There is no original score and the film consists mostly of Indian music (some of it lifted from the films of Satyajit Ray) and, as I've come to expect from Anderson, the occasional Rolling Stones song. The score of Anderson's films tend to blend perfectly with his filmmaking style, but his choice of songs throughout the film complement his style just as perfectly as well as capturing the time and place more effectively.<br /><br />The three principal actors give perfectly low-key performances, as well as capturing the chemistry necessary to actually convey that they're brothers. Brody, Wilson, and Schwartzman have a nice rapport with each other that is very convincing. Famed director Barbet Schroeder has a small role as does Anjelica Huston, although her role is much larger in the schemes of things just not in actual screen-time. In addition, Anderson regular Bill Murray makes a cameo rushing as a businessman rushing to catch his train in the opening scene. Anderson's unique, wry sense of humor is present throughout and it works as a result of being perfectly in tune with his actors. There are some scenes and lines of dialogue that may make you think Anderson invented the art of subtlety, as they sneak in so quietly they may go completely over your head.<br /><br />Some of Anderson's films are less accessible than others and The Darjeeling Limited may be one of those films. Those familiar with his style will be pleased, if not completely thrilled...But those new to Anderson may be perplexed and confused by it. I'm not new to Anderson and I was even a bit perplexed by it. It's not a great film, but besides my gripe with its preference of style over substance, there are no obvious flaws; it just never reveals itself as a great film. Perhaps, like many Criterion titles, it takes time to absorb it and multiple viewings to appreciate it; but The Darjeeling Limited lacks a certain sincerity and coherency for me, which seems essential for a film dealing with such complex human emotions.<br /><br />The 13-minute short film that precedes the film is Hotel Chevalier, starring Schwartzman and Natalie Portman, which is simply about Jack's former lover unexpectedly arriving at his hotel in Paris. I haven't read too much acclaim for this short and few mention it except to say that it fills in some information left unexplained in the film, but I found this poignant, minimalistic short superb. Hotel Chevalier has style and substance in perfect harmony, with Anderson managing to express so much with so little. Relying on very short, vague dialogue and the two actor's facial expressions; Anderson succeeds at conveying some pretty complex emotions in a very artistic, poetic, and lovely way. Even as a stand-alone short, Hotel Chevalier is something special and highly overlooked.<br /><br />The new 2-disc Criterion DVD is a lovely addition to the Criterion catalogue and there's not a complaint to be had about it. It has exactly what you'd expect from a Criterion release including the film, the short film, and enough bonus features to keep the most ardent lover of this film happy for several hours. And, of course the artwork by Eric Chase Anderson looks terrific as usual. If you like this movie and you own the previous edition, you may find this Criterion version worth picking up.<br /><br />THE DARJEELING LIMITED: B-<br />HOTEL CHEVALIER: A-<br />CRITERION RELEASE: A</p></body></html>

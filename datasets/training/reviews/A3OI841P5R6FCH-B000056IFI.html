<meta name="summary" content="Back, once again"></head><body><p>I was kinda miffed when I discovered that 'The Terminator' Special Edition DVD was released in the UK before it was available state-side. You'd think that the first video release of a movie would occur in the country it was made in, right? After all, how would the British digital videophile feel if 'Monty Python' was available on DVD in the US before being released in the UK? Or a Japanese disc-hound if he discovered the 'Akira' Special Edition platter was gonna first hit the street in Toronto instead of Osaka? But, since MGM is a gigantic multinational corporation, and they own the rights to (or have a license to distribute) 'The Terminator' Special Edition DVD, I guess they can release it anywhere and at any time they danged well feel like it. Which is pretty much what they did of course. Fortunately, I still had the original Terminator DVD to tide me over 'til the new platter's release date rolled around.<p>However, after checkin' out this bad boy, my little gripe concerning MGM's distribution practices kinda fell by the wayside. Though not nearly as tricked out as the Special Edition DVD release of T2, this disc does have a pretty good array of extras, including trailers, cut scenes, two documentaries, and even a choice between listening to the new 5.1 sound remix or the original mono! I found this little bonus to be the disc's most interesting feature. Since I'd watched the old mono 'Terminator' many many times, I was really able to hear the difference between the two sound tracks, especially when gunshots were being fired. Just do a quick back & forth switch between the 5.1 and the mono during the police station shootout, and you'll see-- whoops, I mean hear-- what I'm talking about!<p>I was somewhat disappointed that the cut scenes were put aside for separate viewing on the Special Features side, rather than restored to the movie itself. But, when I listened to Cameron's audio commentary regarding these moments, he made a few fairly good reasons why he decided not to make the restoration. Still, I think it would've been a neat idea to have the option of watching the theatrical version and the rendition with these cutting-room bits restored. There's a few more poignant moments with Reese and Sarah, but most of the clipped moments involved Cyberdyne, the company that eventually paves the way for the Terminator's future. I'll not reveal any further info regarding these 'lost' scenes; you'll have to see them for yourself! <p>Then there's the documentaries. The first one is a half-hour retrospective featuring (for the most part) Arnie and Cameron discussing their memories about the making of 'The Terminator'. Then there's the 'Other Voices' doc, featuring remembrances by such notables as director-cowriter James Cameron, makeup effects designer Stan Winston, T2 co-writer William Wisher, producer Gale Ann Hurd, Arnie, Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn, and other people involved in the making of this legendary sci-fi actioner. <p>The one extra feature I was hoping would be on this disc is, unfortunately, absent: a feature-length commentary track by Cameron. I found this little exclusion to be a bit disappointing. I guess I'll just have to deal with it whilst I continue my 'Easter Egg' hunt. However, If you have a DVD-Rom in your computer, this platter also includes three different drafts of the script, as well as watch the movie whilst reading the final draft screenplay. You know, just in case you can't follow the dialogue too well, and you're not too hot about reading those pesky English subtitles. <p>'Late!</p></body></html>

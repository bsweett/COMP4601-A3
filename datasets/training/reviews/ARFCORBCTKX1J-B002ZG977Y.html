Perhaps the beginning is the best place.<br /><br />For me, the beginning was watching Ray Harryhausen's films as a kid. I saw many in first-run. "Earth vs. the Flying Saucers" at the age of 9 was the first.<br /><br />The last was "Clash of the Titans", released at the same time as "Raiders of the Lost Ark". I saw both on the same night in DC, and it was obvious Ray had gone out with a whimper, rather than a bang. "Raiders" handily eclipsed it.<br /><br />The problem with Ray Harryhausen's films was that his stop-motion sequences were /always/ the best things in them. No major studio understood how Harryhausen's effects could "plus" films that already had good scripts, acting, and direction. Only Charles Schneer at Columbia saw the potential of Harryhausen's work, but he could never get the money needed to realize that potential. *<br /><br />Harryhausen's films are a mixed bag of mediocrity. Some of them have good scripts (notably Beverley Cross's for "Jason" and "Titans"), but the direction varies from competent to poor. (Desmond Davis's helming of "Titans" is notably snooze-inducing.) The acting is similarly variable; no one should be obliged to watch Kerwin Matthews in /anything/. (It's hard to believe that Danny Kaye, who'd already made fantasy films, turned down "Gulliver". **) The films /surrounding/ Harryhausen's effects only occasionally approached the imagination and sheer stylishness of those effects. ***<br /><br />On the (very!) plus side, four of those films have Bernard Herrmann scores, "Sinbad" and "Gulliver" being of especially high quality. (Note the praise of "Sinbad"'s score in the Wikipedia article.) And "Titans" has romantic, genuinely thrilling music by Laurence Rosenthal.<br /><br />"Titans" is, to paraphrase King Arthur, "a rather silly film" (though it needn't have been). It went on to become a "kamp klassik", and there was a time when TBS ran it once a month.<br /><br />The producers (and director) of the remake were mostly people who'd seen the original as kids, and had genuine affection for it. So why is it such a bad film?<br /><br />Well... IT ISN'T. The Wikipedia article reveals an ambitious plan to create a mash-up of mythologies from multiple cultures. However clever this was, it would have thoroughly confused audiences. So the remake is principally a rethinking of the original.<br /><br />The original stuck closely to the original myth of Perseus and the Gorgon. Its changes were primarily additions to pad the story. The remake veers widely from the myth, in particular having Perseus found and raised by a fisherman, with his mother Dana? dying.<br /><br />The remake's most-important change is the introduction -- as the central dramatic conflict -- of the conceit that the pagan gods continued their existence only because humans loved and worshipped them. This isn't new; it appears in "Excalibur", "Dragonslayer" (Why is there no Blu-ray of this film, with its wonderful Oscar-nominated Alex North score?), and likely other films. Though a demi-god, Perseus opposes the old order, and wants the gods to butt out of human affairs.<br /><br />The script -- which borrows much from Beverley Cross's original -- is terse and generally free of Dumb Stuff (though the brief appearance of a character from the original, which draws a huge laugh, should have been deleted). The acting is acceptable, with Neeson and Fiennes sensibly underplaying.<br /><br />The problem is the direction. Though the remake moves along crisply, without feeling rushed, Louis Leterrier -- as too many other directors -- has little understanding of how to adjust the pace of a film. He moves flatly from scene to scene, without building tension -- then releasing and rebuilding it. I advise him to listen to the first act of "Die Walk&uuml;re", a perfect example of how this is done musically.<br /><br />Ray Harryhausen's animation reflects this belief in the "slow build". Perseus's confrontation with Medusa (a superb piece of stop-motion animation, the only genuinely good thing in the original) takes its time getting started. It's a cat-and-mouse game that ratchets up the tension. The remake is almost all continuous action, without any rise/fall or give-and-take. This is particularly disappointing, as CGI lets the animators do almost anything they like, without the restrictions of manipulating physical models. This sequence would have been much better had it copied the /style/ of the original.<br /><br />Perhaps the oddest difference between the original and remake is female nudity -- the PG original had it, the PG-13 remake doesn't! In the original, we see a naked Dana? suckling Perseus, and both she and Andromeda are shown "butt"-nekkid.<br /><br />"Clash of the Titans" is not a bad film. Like its precursor, it's silly fun, and can be enjoyed on that level.<br /><br />* It's decidedly ironic that Tinseltown -- the world's leading purveyor of fantasy -- never saw the potential of fantasy films, largely relegating them to B movies and programmers. "The Wizard of Oz" was supposedly framed as a dream, on the assumption audiences wouldn't accept it as "reality". Yet in "Dark Victory", Bette Davis dies quickly and painlessly of an unspecified brain disorder. I find that considerably more "fantastic" than the land of Oz.<br /><br />** "The Three Worlds of Gulliver" is the best adaptation of the novel I've seen (the Robert Halmi TV version included), because it doesn't ignore the satire at the center of the story.<br /><br />*** This is perhaps overstating the case, as even "mediocre" films can have their own styles, and be entertaining. But Ray Harryhausen's outstanding work repeatedly throws into relief the overall weakness of his films. You keep thinking "If only the acting and directing had been better..."</p></body></html>

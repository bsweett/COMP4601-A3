<meta name="summary" content="Why is it cut?"></head><body><p>I bought this movie on DVD, the 98 minute one.  There is alot of talk about how the movie was cut and stuff, and i think they should just release the full version on DVD already.  Some people say its 118 min, or 108 min, or 98 min, i even saw one site say it was 370 min, so from that all i can say is i dont know how long the full version is, and we may never know.  I would suggest waiting for the DVD to come out in America and maybe Tarantino will put the full version on the DVD.  All i can say about the movie is its great but too short, the fights totaly kicked butt, but some or too short, the story is good the performances are good blah blah blah.  If you want a good sword play movie this is it but wait for the extended version, however long or whenever it actually comes.  8 out of a 10, please Tarantino make freakin miramax release the full version,he did say he saw the full version and wanted to release it as is but freakin miramax said people didnt want to sit through 2 hours of movie, if you cant sit through a 2 hour movie you are a chiwawa on crack and you need to get a life, try relaxin and have a good time watchin a movie thats worthy of watching for 2 hours like this one.</p></body></html>

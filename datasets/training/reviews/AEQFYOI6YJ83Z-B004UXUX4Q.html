At the same time, Matt receives word that his comatose wife has no hope of survival, and that by her own instructions, the plug is to be pulled.  Matt finds himself the guardian of a rebellious ten-year-old daughter (Amara Miller), and seeks out his other daughter, an equally rebellious teenager (Shailene Woodley).  The latter informs Matt that his wife was cheating on him, and while on a journey to inform her family of what is happening, Matt decides to seek out this other man.<br /><br />It's a rather complex plot, actually, layered with deep character development and details.  Director/screenwriter Alexander Payne holds everything together marvelously; this is a beautifully crafted, beautifully shot film.  What truly breathes life into THE DESCENDANTS, however, is Payne's way with his actors.  The film rests squarely on the shoulders of George Clooney; while at times ripping off his mannerisms from UP IN THE AIR (the narration doesn't help), Clooney ultimately delivers a very nuanced, very natural performance that probably deserved the 2012 Best Acting Oscar (but we all knew Jean Dujardin would win, didn't we?  Yes, we did.)  Woodley matches Clooney step-for-step, in what will be regarded as her breakthrough performance.  Miller also gives a solid performance (I've ranted about child actors before; there's no need to rant about Miller).  Robert Forster gives a memorable performance at Matt's father-in-law, while Matthew Lillard takes a nice dramatic turn as "the other man" (with Judy Greer as his wife).  Nick Krause provides some fantastic comedic moments as Sid, a teenage suitor.<br /><br />And that's the great thing about THE DESCENDANTS: even at its darkest, saddest moments, it doesn't forget to be funny.  Because humor can be found anywhere, and Payne and company aren't afraid to show you.  Some viewers may be put off by the fact that a movie about a family coping with death can be so funny in spots; but such is life.  Payne has found the perfect material, and the perfect cast, to create a tale of humor and tragedy.  It doesn't hurt that this is, quite simply, an amazing film.</p></body></html>

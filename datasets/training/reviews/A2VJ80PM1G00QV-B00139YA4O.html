<meta name="summary" content="Nobody Knew the Troubles They Were to See"></head><body><p>I write in 2010, as someone who had never heard of the series until it was recently suggested to me as something worth seeing in my, by-now long hiatus, in television watching. It also appears that it had survived until this year terminated its run.<br />Seeing this first season now, I can recognize that it had promise even that first year: the creative staff knew how to create evening soap opera and the director and cast had the talent, overall, to put their ideas into convincing performances. That is not to say that anyone was challenging Sir Lawrence Olivier's pre-eminence as master of the English speaking stage, but mostly the strength was where it was needed. I have no ideas what troubles were devised in the remaining years, but these refugees from civilization stranded on an island, sure had plenty of nicely suspenseful ones. Seeing the season without commercial breaks, without delay of a week between episodes, puts a production to a very tough test it was not devised to surmount. The breaks are built into the structure of each program. However, the production bore up well. Obviously, there is a family resemblance inevitably built in to make the show somewhat like other good (and bad) stranded on an island stories, but rarely does the material seem stale.<br />I can commend the show to any television viewer who likes to immerse him-or her-self in the challenges to life that that a threatened community must face.</p></body></html>

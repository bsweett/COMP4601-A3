<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyed it, clever, yet action packed."></head><body><p>Has a nice sence of action, can't deny that. The beggining has the guy lost at sea, kind of mysterious. I really just enjoyed the great job they did with it. You knew when Jason was paranoid, you knew when he sensed there was trouble.<p>Basically, if you can't figure it out, he was set up for an assassination, or was he? Kind of set up, mediumish, anyways all I know is that Jason was shot 2 times in the back, and yea he screwed up probably. So what is it. Well theres some nice fighting, some good gun shooting action, even a nice car scene.<p>He lost his memory, so he is trying to retrace his steps sort of. He does a fantastic job of being a spy like guy, and has some good instincts, I just loved it for the first time though. When you rent it, you don't know what's going to happen. I would just rent the movie, I don't want to spoil it, but Jason has gotta go up against some pro assassins.</p></body></html>

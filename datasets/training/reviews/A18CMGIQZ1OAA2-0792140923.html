<meta name="summary" content="one of the best 2 films of my lifetime"></head><body><p>I really dont know what i love more, the book or the movie. Forrest Gump was one of the most distinguished and classic films of my lifetime.  Its a story of a simpleton who goes through his life with a sense of determination that seems to blow the minds of most of the people he meets.  His decisions are always pretty clear.  He spends his life doing the right thing and holding true to the first friend and one true love of his life Jenny, who due to a child rearing of molestation and child abuse cracks down and falls to heroin and promiscuous sex.  This movie is a must for any american history buff. Forrest is a part of every major piece of history he experiences in his life.  He is a vietnam war hero, he walks dead on into a landmark of what would become the tear down of segregation, he witnesses the watergate scandal and the aids epidemic.  A simple man who experiences an unbelievably full life.  The movies scenery was inspired by norman rockwell and the soundtrack is phenominal.</p></body></html>

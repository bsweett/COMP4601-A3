<meta name="summary" content="What If This Would Have Been The Original?"></head><body><p>After following up the incredible "Silence of the Lambs" with a very-lacking "Hannibal", the Hannibal Lecter series of films goes back to its origins with "Red Dragon". The results are much more enjoyable (if a bit repetitive), making one wonder what might have happened had THIS been the original?<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Red Dragon" takes place before the events of "Lambs". Brilliant young FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton) finally captures the mysterious Hannibal (Anthony Hopkins), but sustains wounds both psychological and physical in the process. Fast-forward a few years into the future, and Graham must revisit Lecter in order to solve the gruesome "Tooth Fairy" (Ralph Fiennes) murders.<br /><br />Clearly, director Brett Ratner studied the faults of "Hannibal" and made sure not to include them in this third installment. This time, the plot takes the same basic form as the original, only with a new killer and agent. This results in a much better overall narrative and interesting movie. Basically, if you enjoyed "Lambs" then this one will give you a similar experience.<br /><br />Why isn't this film regarded as more of a classic, then? Well, frankly it is because it already WAS done before in "Lambs"! In effect, its greatest strength is also what prevents it from being a true classic. It is (almost quite literally) a "Cut, Copy, Paste" of the original format. This is good in comparison to "Hannibal", but by definition it just can't quite attain the success of "Lambs", since the original is always the original.<br /><br />Overall, then, "Red Dragon" is a solid movie that, truth be told, probably resurrected the Hannibal series of movies and gave it some hope for a future. It completely goes back to its roots to tell an interesting story, and it succeeds in utilizing Hopkins to his fullest. It just won't go on your "best of" list because "Lambs" is already there. One has to wonder, though, what could have happened if this plot would have been the original...?</p></body></html>

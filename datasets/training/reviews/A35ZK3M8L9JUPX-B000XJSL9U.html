When he's told that because it's the 4th of July most of their agents are not around so they might have trouble getting people to get the hackers. So he instructs them to get local PD'S to take care of it. And one of the cops they ask is John McClane who is tasked with bringing a hacker named Farrell to the FBI. But as soon as he gets there someone starts shooting at them. McClane manages to get them out but they're still being pursued. And it's just when McClane arrives in Washington that the whole system breaks down and chaos ensues. Willis is in his element. Olyphant is perfectly ice cold. Some great action sequences, including a fight to the death in an elevator shaft. This movie takes a classic climactic situation and resolves it in the coolest, most unexpected and most low-tech way imaginable, and in a way that reinforces everything you've ever liked about the "Die Hard" movies and McClane as a character. It's just terrific.</p></body></html>

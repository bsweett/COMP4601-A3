<meta name="summary" content="CRASH! BOOM! BANG! (in a restrained sort of way)"></head><body><p>Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck) is a young lawyer who works for a powerful firm and is married to his boss's daughter (Amanda Peet, Banek's boss/father-in-law is played by director Sydney Pollack).<br />Doyle Gipson (Samuel L. Jackson) is an average working class Joe and recovering alcoholic. Both men obviously have nothing in common, but their paths cross when their cars collide on the freeway. Late for work, the self-absorbed yuppie Banek offers Gipson a blank check and hastily abandons the scene of the accident. However, Gipson has stolen one of Banek's legal files containing info which is pertinent to a case he is trying. Luckily for him, the judge gives Banek till day's end to recover the file. Sounds simple? No way, Jose. Because the collision has also had an undesirable effect on Gipson's day as well; as his lateness has cost him a custody battle for his sons. What is the obvious solution to the problem? Good ol' reliable blackmail, of course.<br />Later Banek and Gipson's paths cross again and Banek once more attempts to make amends or the accident, but Gipson is a man with a chip on his shoulder the size of Al Gore's ego and he's not about to make life easy for Banek; who just happens to be married to the boss's daughter.<br />CHANGING LANES is a movie which is never boring, and is helped a lot by Jackson's usual strong performance. Ben Affleck on the other hand, is Ben Affleck. It's amazing how with all the money he's made Ben doesn't seem to possess the initiative to take acting lessons; and it's also a shame that Toni Collette isn't given much to do in her role here as Affleck's secretary. That's my only complaint. CHANGING LANES is one of those pictures which is becoming a rare commodity in Hollywood these days: a film with intelligence and integrity (plus the requisite car chase sequence). Well worth a look.</p></body></html>

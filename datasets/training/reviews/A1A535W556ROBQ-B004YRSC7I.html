Christopher Nolan pieces together the shattered life of Leonard Shelby, very effectively conveying the sense of schizophrenia.  The scenes dovetail a little too neatly, which wouldn't necessarily be the case with schizophrenics, but this is aimed more at allowing the viewer to reassemble the movie.  Guy Pearce puts in another fine performance, capturing the manic edge of the protagonist as he struggles to solve the vexing riddle of his identity.  The movie is more about style than substance.  The story itself is rather simple, but Nolan's sharp editing makes it a movie to remember.</p></body></html>

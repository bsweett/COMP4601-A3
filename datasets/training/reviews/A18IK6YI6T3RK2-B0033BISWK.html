<meta name="summary" content="STRAIGHT OUT OF JO-BURG"></head><body><p>This movie came with a great deal of hype and frankly it just doesnt live up to it.  The docu. feel of the movie is a nice touch, but really I never cared much about the protagonist, he just seemed like such a yutz, and this story has been done to death.  Yeah, yeah, I get the story is a metaphor for Aparteid, set above Johannesburg etc..but it just really didnt resonate with me.  The special effects are a low budget, but really not bad, but the creatures are horrible, I mean what in the hell are they suppose to be?..couldnt they have come up with cooler looking aliens?!!..have they not seen, uh Aliens?!!..this movie is similar to Alien Nation, but really not as interesting and they ending is sort of..uh O.K.?..Maybe had the acting been better, and the story not so rote, I may have been able to get into this film, but frankly im clueless at to why it got so much hype.</p></body></html>

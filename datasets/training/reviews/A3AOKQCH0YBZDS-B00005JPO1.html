<meta name="summary" content="Not The Strongest Movie in the Indiana Jones Franchise"></head><body><p>Ugh, not a good movie. I was thoroughly disappointed on the whole with the new Indiana Jones movie and was glad that I only saw it via dvd rental.<br /><br />Yes, the action was good and non-stop as to be expected, but the storyline wasn't even good. The previous three Indiana Jones movies had a pleasant balance of both action and storyline, but not this one.<br /><br />Also, the action scenes seemed to be down almost entirely of CG/computer graphics and the CG looked so fake and unreal, which was another let down while watching this movie. I'd have thought with all the technology out there today, that the CG would have been a lot better quality... I guess I thought wrong.</p></body></html>

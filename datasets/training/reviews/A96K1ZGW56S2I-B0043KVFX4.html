<meta name="summary" content="Not Quite an Epic: For Fans of Milla and Ali"></head><body><p>Milla Jovovich reprises her role as Alice in this latest installment of the RESIDENT EVIL franchise.  The disaster of the Raccoon City experiment by the Umbrella Corporation has caused a worldwide outbreak of the deadly T-Virus.  Those who haven't been infected find themselves constantly on the go moving from one location to another.  Alice moves and works alone.  That is until she rescues a caravan of survivors under attack from a swarm of mutated crows in the deserts of Nevada not far from Las Vegas.  The group includes former friends of Alice's, Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) and L.J. (Mike Epps) and the leader of the group Claire Redfield (Ali Carter).  Alice has evidence of a possible safe haven in Alaska and convinces the group to go there.  But first they have to get gas in Las Vegas and the things in Vegas don't necessarily just stay in Vegas anymore.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed by RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION.  I was looking forward to an epic battle between the survivors and the zombies or at least between those at the Umbrella Corporation.  Actually, I would have settled for just a bunch of cool action sequences. Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of that going on.  There are a few minor skirmishes here and there.  There's also a lot of build-up to what's supposed to be a huge battle, but it never happens.<br /><br />I had assumed that RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION was going to be the final film in this video-game based trilogy, but the movie is so heavy on character development and ends with such a strange twist that at least one other film must be planned.  The film does have a decent amount of blood and gore for those who like those things, but it isn't as excessive as it is in the video games or previous movies (there's violence, but not just as much).<br /><br />Those who have seen the previous RESIDENT EVIL films will probably at least want to watch RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION.  Also, even though she doesn't have too much screen time, the movie is worth watching for Ali Carter.  Of course, there's also Milla Jovovich, too.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Discontinuous, but effectively scary"></head><body><p>I understand that this movie may be very loosely based on real events, but if you accept (for the purposes of furthering your own enjoyment) that this movie is based on real events, and you believe in ghosts/demons, etc., this movie rocks.  I would have enjoyed it more if it focused more on the girl's experiences (as opposed to the trial), but I suppose that that is one of the creative aspects of the movie. However, I found the horror very highly effective, and it is scary.</p></body></html>

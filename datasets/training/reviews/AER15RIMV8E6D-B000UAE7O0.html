<meta name="summary" content="Welcome to the Grindhouse!!!"></head><body><p>I thought Planet Terror was awesome and the better of the two Grindhouse movies! We first meet Cherry Darling doing a sexy go-go dance, but she wants to quit. During this time, some Military men are meeting at a Military base with a scientist named Abby. The Military need a huge amount of deadly biochemical agent called DC2. When the deal goes wrong, Abby shoots the DC2 and it all fills the night air and infects some of the town's residents. Then we meet Dr. Block and his wife, Dakota. They work the graveyard shift at the hospital. Meanwhile, Cherry runs into her old boyfriend, El Wray. During a ride in his truck, they run into some trouble with zombies! Cherry loses her leg, and Wray takes her to the hospital. At the hospital, the bodies keep rolling in, and the zombies take over. Cherry, Wray, Dakota, and the sheriff all meet at the sheriff's brother's BBQ place called The Bone Shack. They try to figure out how to survive the zombie outbreak, and get taken to the military base where the final battle between the living, and the dead plays out! There were a lot of awesome gore scenes! If you love zombies, and action, you'll love PLANET TERROR!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Hockey Mask Legend is Born"></head><body><p>Chris and her friends just want to have a good time this weekend, so they're taking a trip to her family's nice, relaxing family cabin in Higgins Haven. Unfortunately for them, Jason survived his encounter with Ginny from the last film. He winds up at a store where he kills a married couple and gets a change of clothes. Higgins Haven just happens to be close by. Chris has more than one reason for going on this trip though. She was attacked a few years ago by a hideously disfigured man and is facing her fears in hopes of moving past it. Could this mysterious man and Jason have something in common?<br /><br />This is the film that introduced us to the hockey mask and was originally in 3-D. It's a shame that's all it really offers though. Watching the 3-D version now will just leave you with a horrible headache. I actually prefer the film in 2-D. The nudity in the film is also rather light and before you jump on me for saying that, that's one of the main things you look forward to in a Friday the 13th film; Jason Voorhees, inventive kills, T&A, and maybe a few laughs. That's what makes the Friday the 13th films fun. Especially compared to the first two films, sideboob and a brief glimpse in the shower doesn't really cut it. I guess what really ruined it for me was the homages to the first film. By the way, what was up with the ending? And why does Mrs. Voorhees suddenly have her head again? It wasn't a bad idea to do a few throwbacks to the original, but it felt like too much by the end of the film.<br /><br />Rating - 5/10</p></body></html>

No doubt there was a deep seated prejudice against the Irish immigrants in the 19th century, there was crime in New York, anti-Lincoln feeling, and race riots occurred there also.  But this movie made one think that there was nothing but hate, poverty and riots in Manhattan.  Don't believe it!<br /><br />It is hard to know what the movie was trying to say.  Was it a social statement or a Hamlet-like tale about revenge.  Everyone was shown as corrupt including the Mayor and his people, the leaders of the gangs, the police and the armed forces, the outstanding newspaper publisher in the City and the protagonist and his love interest.  How did the City ever get to the 20th century?<br /><br />The movie had little focus, lots of violence, mostly unnecessary violence, and there was no one worth one's admiration, sympathy or pity.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a good bit better than film critics led me to believe"></head><body><p>i really enjoyed this picture . thank god for NETFLIX . i seldom pay to see a film theatrically anymore (perhaps twice a year) . a co-worker told me she really enjoyed it and recommended it . i don't watch television (as i refuse to pay for it and hate the adds and so on) . perhaps seeing less makes you appreciate stories you do see more ? dunno , but i thought it was a lot of fun and worth owning for a modest price . liked the cinematography a lot too . judge for yourself .</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great flick still packs a punch"></head><body><p>Please note that this review is for the PAL rather than the NTSC version of the film.<br /><br />Ironically, after creating this cinematic masterpiece, Welles, now the outcast boy wonder director of Hollywood at the ripe old age of 26, spent the next half century with his hand out trying to fund similarly visionary films that never got made, although he continued to be popular as an actor. Everyone praised his work as that of a great genius but no one would give him more work, after Citizen Kane was hailed as a masterpiece but still lost $150,000. And no investor was willing to put up money for a brilliant but eccentric genius no matter how gifted who couldn't pull in the receipts at the box office--essentially no different from what happens today.<br /><br />Welles's predicament reminded me of the great Spencer Tracy at the end of his career, who said the same thing. Prior to his being cast in "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner," no one would insure him for the movie due to his heart condition, so he and Katherine bought the insurance themselves, according to the story. He made the same comment about everyone praising his work but no one being willing to hire him.<br /><br />This film resembles more a 19th century late romantic symphony or a work of jaded Impressionism than a typical American film. It melds dramatic camera angles and cinematography, world weary, fin de siecle dialog, a brooding and almost nihilistic atmosphere, and a non-chronological timeline to create what for the time was a revolutionary film. In one scene in the film, where the enraged Welles as Hearst is trashing his study, scattering books and various objects everywhere, he said afterwords, "By God, I felt it, I really felt it." Overall, Welles's signature work of genius and one of the most influential movies of all time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A FINE EPIC AND A WORTHY SEQUEL TO "ELIZABETH!""></head><body><p>The follow-up film to 1998's "Elizabeth," "Elizabeth: The Golden Age" continues the story of Elizabeth I, played by Cate Blanchett, who reprises her role from the previous film. The film deals with the Virgin Queen's relationship with Sir Walter Raleigh, while King Philip II of Spain amasses a massive armada to destroy Elizabeth, and replace her on the throne with Mary, Queen of Scots.<br />While the film does take dramatic license with historical events, it is a moving, powerful portrayal of the life and times of Elizabeth I. Blanchett is once again fantastic as Elizabeth, while Clive Owen is great as Raleigh. Samantha Morton (Mary), Geoffrey Rush (Walsingham) and Jordi Moll&agrave; (Philip II) give strong supporting performances. While the story itself is a bit slow during the first half, it picks up in the second half, with fantastic visual effects and action creating a powerful reenactment of the fight with the Spanish Armada off the British Coast.<br />If you enjoyed the original "Elizabeth," then you will find equal enjoyment out of "The Golden Age." But if you haven't seen the first film, you'll be sure to enjoy this film all the same.<br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+</p></body></html>

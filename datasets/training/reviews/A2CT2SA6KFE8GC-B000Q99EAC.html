<meta name="summary" content="RRRRRRRRRocky BalbOOOOOOOOOAAAAAA"></head><body><p>When this film was announced over a year ago, the chuckles and jokes(If I had a nickel for every friggin' time someone said "what, is he gonna fight in a wheelchair?", I'd buy a yacht) began.  After all, the Rocky series was being poked fun at back at #4.  Stallone was obviously well aware of how people would react to the concept of another Rocky film on the surface, and wrote his script accordingly.  The people in the film feel the same way about Rocky as the folks in the real world who laughed the movie off.  It is great screenwriting on Stallone's part and made people and critics think twice about the movie.  This turned out to be a damn good movie, and most folks agree.  The movie is done as if Parts 3, 4, and 5 didn't exist.  You could almost look at it as the true Rocky 3.  There are really no references to the other films, at least none that would make a difference.  It seems as though Stallone wanted to really get back to the roots of the story and get back in touch with the character.  Over the course of the sequels(parts 3 and 4 specifically), he seemed to have lost touch with the character a bit.  As Rocky became more famous and wealthy, he also suddenly spoke more intelligently(he pretty much spoke the way Stallone did in all of his 80s action films), and became a bit more high brow.  Rocky's always been a lovable, generous guy with a big heart, but a little punchy and loopy, and in this film Rocky seems to have his personality back.  On the other hand, you can still assume the events of the sequels happened as well, coz there really is nothing to contradict that they happened.  Here we see Rocky living alone, wandering the neighborhood, wondering what happened to everything he loved.  His wife, Adrian has passed on and he simply can't get over it.  His son sees him more as a bother than anything and only seems to talk to him out of necessity.  Even the folks who all once glorified him as a hero just seem to regard him with little enthusiasm.  He's just a relic in the sports world.  It's all kinda depressing actually, especially a sequence where he drags his brother in-law, Paulie, along with him to revisit locations where he and Adrian used to frequent, while he reminisces about their times together.  He also owns a restaurant and that seems to be the only joy he has.  He does befriend a woman(the girl on the street corner he gives a pep talk to in the original Rocky film) and her son, and they become good friends.  Not romantic, but the potential is there.  When a computer generated fight putting Rocky(in the prime of his career) against the current world champion shows Rocky kicking the champ's butt, opportunity knocks.  The champ(Antonio Tarver, who had to beef up to play a heavyweight fighter) doesn't like the embarrassment.  He also has personal demons of his own.  His managers and the boxing promoters see this as a goldmine opportunity and soon they're knocking on Rocky's door.  Rocky's been bored for so long and has nothing to lose, so he decides to do it.  What the hell, right?  Plus, Rocky sees it as a way to feel like somebody again whether he wins or loses, as long as he goes the distance, does his best, and can prove to everybody that he's not some old fogey that is just gonna get knocked on his butt in the second round.  In a way, it's alot like the first film in that regard, that he really has nothing to lose and is doing it more to prove something to himself rather than everyone else.  The fight is visually probably the best and most realistic of the series with the first few minutes looking as though you're actually watching a Pay Per View bout.  Pretty cool.  How does it turn out?  Watch it!  Stallone definitely scored a knockout with this one.  Very good.</p></body></html>

The special effects are mind-boggling, the action non-stop, the cast strong and Megan Fox irresistible. I also enjoyed the intermittent comedic sequences that added a nice change of pace. Sam's Mom wandering around campus with the "tainted" brownies was classic. There are numerous reviews that lament over a weak plot but I disagree completely with such a suggestion. I loved the way they amalgamated various aspects of New Age beliefs with a Christian apocalyptic vision, replacing demonic entities with intergalactic Decepticons descending upon the Earth to finish an ages old battle on the Giza plateau. Indeed a glorious, mechanized Armageddon!<br /><br />Definitely lots of fun here. The one thing I question about 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' is the language and sexual references liberally sprinkled throughout the film. While this is a film that can be enjoyed by movie fans of all ages there seems to be a few scenes here and there that may not be appropriate for some of the younger viewers.</p></body></html>

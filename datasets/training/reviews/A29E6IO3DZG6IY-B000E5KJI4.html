<meta name="summary" content="Superb!"></head><body><p>Superbly entertaining!  EPIC!  Characters and the intricacies of the ancient myths are well expressed.  Brad Pitt is AMAZING as Achilles.  Eric Bana is excellent as Hector, Diane Krueger is loveliness itself and Sir Peter O'Toole, while I thought him too 'white' for the part, is such a good actor that I forgot his paleness and was thoroughly taken in by his performance, as well as everyone elses, right down to the baby as Hector's son.<br />Everthing about this movie is SPLENDID and well researched too.  The costuming and sets are the closest to what would have been in that time period, inspiringly drawn and constructed, including an ingeniously designed Trojan horse.  The acting, screenwriting, cinematography, special effects, choreography, music, etc, are all excellent.<br />While the actual war lasted some 10 years (hence the thousand ships), it's considerably condensed for the purposes of movie making and some aspects of the story were changed, yet this movie is thoroughly engaging entertainment.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Creasy's Art is Death...He's About to Paint His Masterpiece..."></head><body><p>With a story that appears to have been ripped directly from the headlines, director Tony Scott reteams with his "Crimson Tide" star, Denzel Washington, and delivers what is possibly one of the most suspenseful, well-written, well-directed and acted revenge tales ever committed to film.  In "Man on Fire", Tony Scott chose to shed some light on the terrible tragedy of kidnappings that occur almost daily in Mexico.  Even though I generally despise movie studios that re-release movies to DVD less than a year after the intial release, this All-Access edition of "Man on Fire" gives the movie the proper treatment it deserves.<br /><br />"Man on Fire" is the story of a former C.I.A. agent, John Creasy (Denzel Washington), who takes on the role of bodyguard and mentor for the young daughter of a wealthy family in Mexico City.  However, when the young girl, Pita (Dakota Fanning), is kidnapped for ransom, the kidnappers unwittingly bring about a firestorm of unbridled fury from inside Creasy.  Now, Creasy embarks on a quest to rescue Pita, and God be with anyone who gets in his way, because no one else will be.<br /><br />"Man on Fire" accomplishes something many other revenge tales never even aspire to, that is actually delivering a story of substance, and not just violence.  The scenes between Denzel and Dakota are touching, and paint a brilliant portrait of the love Creasy is beginning to feel for this young girl, and how she is showing him that it is ok to live and feel again.  Once she's kidnapped the movie really kicks into overdrive and never lets up.  With outstanding performances from Dakota Fanning and Denzel Washington, and terrific supporting actors like Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke, this movie is top-notch all the way.  Definitely not a movie to be missed!<br /><br />"Man on Fire" is rated R for violence and language.</p></body></html>

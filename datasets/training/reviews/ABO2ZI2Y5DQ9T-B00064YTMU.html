<meta name="summary" content="Despite Plot Holes, This LA Noir Manages To Entertain"></head><body><p>Michael Mann's new thriller cannot boast the ingenious script -- it's full of holes -- but it is still a taut, stylish one with good acting from Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx.  It's not long and self-important saga of 'Ali'; it's more like 'Heat' where tension rises as characters are driven to the edges.<br /><br />It's Los Angels Airport, where the story starts.  Tom Cruise's guy Vincent receives a bag from another guy (slyly cast cameo of the British star of 'Transporter').  Vincent, apparently a cool businessman on trip, has to do some jobs within a day, as you see later.<br /><br />And Jamie Foxx is a taxi driver Max, hard-working, honest, and believing that he can do his own business one of these days, and has spent more than 10 years doing the same thing.  Now, Vincent hires Max, offering a lucrative ride, which turns out a very unusual one, for at the first place the taxi are headed for, a dead body falls down from the fourth floor.<br /><br />Right, this is a change of pace for Tom Cruise, Mr. Nice Guy whose CV includes 'Top Gun' and 'Mission Impossible.'  This time, however, he plays a calculating, chilly man from underworld, who knows how to kill without mercy, but has his own philosophy of life.  It's contradicatory, but Tom Cruise manages to be the merciless killer with great skills.<br /><br />Besides Jamie Foxx who is very convincing as Mr. Everyman  easily intimidated at first, but gradually changing to somebody else, Jada Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, and Bruce McGill appear, plus Irma P Hall ('The Ladykiller') who adds a precious tone of comic relief to the noir.<br /><br />But the film is without doubt Mann's, or I should say, Mann's images of LA at night.  He not only lives in the city, but knows the city, and the 'sprawling' city ('Vincent's word) with many faces plays the most important role in the film.<br /><br />The most regrettable thing is the story of Stuart Beattie which is full of plot-holls.  Think about it.  A real  professional killer would drive his own car, instead of taking a cab, for instance, and the such items as the silly FBI or ineffective witness protection belong to the B movie cliche.<br /><br />Still, Mann succeeds in making the film quite gripping  thriller, with the great use of LA landscapes.  Don't think too much when watching it.  Just prepare to be entertained.</p></body></html>

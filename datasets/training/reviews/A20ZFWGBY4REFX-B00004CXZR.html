<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; is the ultimate Trek film!!"></head><body><p>I am really glad that Robert Wise and company decided to go back and put in the new special effects and new scenes that were left out in the rushed 1979 release of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;. This is among one of the absolute best &quot;Star Trek&quot; films ever made because you get to see what happens to Kirk, Spock, and crew after their famous 5-year mission in the original series. And plus, you get to see a new side of the U.S.S. Enterprise when they transformed it from a smaller ship (original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series) to an even bigger ship! And also, you get to see a couple of new faces, including Stephen Collins as Commander Will Decker and the late Persis Khambatta as Lieutenant Ilia. Some of my favorite improvements of &quot;The Motion Picture&quot; are as follows:<p>A.) The overture and main title sequences<br />B.) The color of the sky on the planet Vulcan, Spock's home<br />C.) Starfleet Headquarters in the future San Francisco<br />D.) The Enterprise's warp speed sequences<br />E.) Shots of the Enterprise's warp nacelles inside the officer's lounge<br />F.) The improved Red Alert sounds<br />G.) A full shot of V'Ger heading toward Earth<br />H.) Shots of Kirk, Spock, Dr. McCoy, Decker, and Ilia outside of the Enterprise as they were heading toward V'Ger's source<p>This &quot;Star Trek&quot; film has pretty much everything that you'd expect from a &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, such as action, a great storyline, and new and improved special effects! And you also get a little romance thanks to Decker and Ilia. This is truly one of the greatest &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies ever made, alongside the other 8 Trek films. And like &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot;, there will be no other film like &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;...maybe someday.</p></body></html>

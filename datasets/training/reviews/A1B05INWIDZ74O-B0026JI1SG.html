<meta name="summary" content="A Knockout"></head><body><p>This movie was nominated for seven Oscar's awards.  And as is mentioned in another review, Oscars were won by Clint Eastwood for Direction, Morgan Freeman for best performance by a Supporting Actor, Hilary Swank for best performance by a leading actress and Best Picture. But this movie should be watched because it is very well made. And should help the Woman's Boxing Federation gain the respect they deserve.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn an overcautious boxing trainer who knows how to train champions. Morgan Freeman plays his friend Scrap who is an ex-boxer who lost use of his eye in his final fight. Of course Frankie Dunn blames himself for this injury and is one of the reasons we learn he is so cautious with his fighters. And of course Hilary Swank plays Maggie, a very hungry fighter who has been self-training for years and has won some fights. She wants Frankie to train her and of course he wants nothing to do with here. For some reason we never learn, Frankie daughter wants nothing to do with him and all the letters he writes to her are returned unopened.<br /><br />The movie builds from there with Maggie earning Frankie support with the helping hand of Scrape. And we watch as her training progresses and career starts. The training and fighting is very real. The acting is superb, as is the story. It is not your normal movie of today were you can figure out exactly what will happen. It takes some twist and turns along the way throwing you surprises as movies use too. I do not care much for boxing yet I still rate this as a must see movie.</p></body></html>

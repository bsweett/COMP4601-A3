Its themes of love and personal responsibility are timeless.  Its simple, straight-forward storyline has enthralled moviegoers for over half a century.<br /><br />In the French North Africa of 1942, Rick Blaine, a cynical Amercian expatriate with a shadowy past (played by Humphrey Bogart) runs the most popular bar in the City of Casablanca.  Casablanca's administrators are under the thumb of the Nazi regime that occupied France in 1940.  On the run from the Nazis come a resistance leader named Victor (played by Paul Hanreid) and his wife Ilsa (played by Ingrid Bergman).  Ilsa is Rick's ex-lover from Paris, just before the war.  The two fugitives seek safe passage to America, a passage they can only obtain from Rick Blaine.<br /><br />The world-weary Rick is disinclined to stick his neck out to assist the two fugitives, but Ilsa pays him a nocturnal visit to renew old acquintances.  She finds to her surprise that she still loves Rick and he her.  She abandons herself to his judgement with respect to her future with him and the fate of her husband.  Rick is left to choose between the love of his life and the fate of a resistance leader who may be crucial to the defeat of the Nazis, a defeat not yet visible in the dark days of 1942.  His dilemma is at the heart of this movie's enduring appeal, as Rick must balance love with personal responsibility for a larger fate.<br /><br />The movie is populated with an excellent and well-sketched cast of supporting players: a corrupt French Police Chief with a heart of gold who is Rick's best friend in Casablanca; Sam the Piano Player, who renders the classic song "As Time Goes by" to a grieving Rick Blaine; Peter Lorre as an unlucky pickpocket, and Sidney Greenstreet as a seedy deal-maker.<br /><br />Among the classic moments in the movie are Victor leading the patrons of Rick's Bar in drowning out a group of obnoxious Nazi officers with a rousing rendition of the French national anthem; Rick ordering "play it, Sam" when Sam is reluctant to play Ilsa's favorite tune; and the goodbye scene at the airport, where Rick makes his dramatic choice and must live with the consequences.<br /><br />This movie is most highly recommended to anyone with an interest in a truly classic, and entertaining, movie.</p></body></html>

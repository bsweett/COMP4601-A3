<meta name="summary" content="EXCELLENT MOVIE/Guaranteed to shed a tear!!!"></head><body><p>Definitely a great epic movie, Braveheart, brings to the screen the story of the Scot hero William Wallace, as he seeks revenge against the English for the killing of his wife and family, and the freedom of his country.<br /><br />Braveheart combines drama, action, adventure, even humor, making it one of the best of its kind, thus, resurrecting interest in historical films after a long dormant period.<br /><br />Needless to say, Mel Gibson, Sophie Marceau, Catherine McCormack, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!<br /><br />The setting, the special effects, the music and the costumes are all wonderful!<br /><br />Love, Honor, Battles, and swordfights are all about.<br /><br />In short, it is a movie worth watching!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A true thriller"></head><body><p>"The Last King of Scotland" is one of the most heart-pounding thrillers I have ever seen due in no small part to the fact that the film is loosely based on real life events. Despite knowing the history, I found myself cheering when Idi Amin (Whitaker) made his first speeches to the Ugandan people, about being a simple man and wanting a better Africa for all his people.  Whitaker played it like he meant it--and perhaps Amin did at the first.  Though I knew better, I truly wanted to believe.<br /><br />As Machiavelli says, "Absolute power corrupts absolutely," the veneer disappears fairly quickly.  People once in power disappear and the nightmare grows worse from there.<br /><br />There were long stretches, where I almost forgot I was watching a film instead of color newsreels.  The cast and crew of this film really created an atmosphere of being there.  "Last King" is a strong film, beautifully acted, filmed, and directed.</p></body></html>

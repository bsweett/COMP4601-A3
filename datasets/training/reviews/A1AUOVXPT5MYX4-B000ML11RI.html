<meta name="summary" content="This is a great movie"></head><body><p>Whether you like it or whether you don't, if you like movies, you "must see" this film. Whether you like Roberto Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino or whether you don't, this film raises the bar for comic book and comic book concept movies for the future. From this movie on, there are only two credible, if widely divergent, paths to take in bringing a comic book concept to the screen: "Spiderman 2", or "Sin City". One can make a movie as earnestly, beautifully real, full of genuine human feeling, and as lovingly put on screen as "literal truth" as "Spiderman 2", or one can make a movie as stunningly surreal and hyperbolically drawn as "Sin City", but most other attempts will seem poor pretenders. Not to belittle the critic's darling "American Splendor", but that small comic gem, quirky and unique, will truly seem like a quaint anachronism after "Frank Miller's Sin City". This movie will be as influential on future movie-making as the original "Star Wars" was in its day.</p></body></html>

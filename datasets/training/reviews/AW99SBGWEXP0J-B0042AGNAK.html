<meta name="summary" content="Ghost Rider"></head><body><p>In his youth, Johnny Blaze (Cage) made a deal with the Devil (Fonda) .  He gave up his sould to the to save his father's life.  Years later, as the world's top stuntman, nothing can stop him from the most crazy of stunts.  The Devil won't let him die.  When Blackheart (Bentley) comes to Earth to take it over, the Devil makes Johnny into Ghost Rider - a flaming skeleton on a bike - and tasks him to defeat Blackheart and his minions.<br /><br />"Ghost Rider" is clearly on the B-list of Marvel superheroes, and that is evident in the film.  That is not necessarily a bad thing, as the movie is enjoyable in its own way.  Surprisingly, despite its subject matter, "Ghost Rider" does provide a number of lighter moments that contribute to its enjoyment.  The actors are all adequate, none a standout.  The effects are nicely done.  Hollywood has come a long way in animating digital flames.  In the end, "Ghost Rider" is an entertaining, but forgettable, superhero movie.</p></body></html>

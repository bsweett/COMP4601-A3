I didn't quite understand what that whole thing was about and then sighed with relief when that plot line turned out to be a ruse.  I thought there was an interesting assembly of characters set in a Victorian age and I agree Dorian Gray stood out in his performance.  I can't quite put my finger on what this film is missing, but I do know that it's missing something.  Maybe a better explantion of bringing this assembly of people together in the first place when they, quite frankly, didn't have you in their radar to begin with.  Couldn't he go about gathering what he needed from them without all this elaborate drama?  Overall, this is an entertaining film and not at all as bad as I feared.</p></body></html>

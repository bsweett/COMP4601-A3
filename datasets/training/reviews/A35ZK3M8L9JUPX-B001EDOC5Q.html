I think, if its possible, they use the surrounding scenery to an even more dramatic effect then in the first movie. The attention to detail was excellent. It was a world you could live in and believe in. The actors were superb and that included the voice actors for the animals. I found it a very good story and one that gives you plenty to talk about, and think on.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Marriage Made In Heaven?"></head><body><p>John has just returned from shooting Lucky at the bar<br /><br />"Jane Smith: Where've you been?<br /><br />John Smith: I just went down to the sports bar. Put a little money on the game.<br /><br />Jane Smith: How'd you do?<br /><br />John Smith: I got Lucky."<br /><br />The above dialogue is a sample of what and how this movie moves along. A shoot'em, bang-bang movie with most of the action between these two people, Mr. and Mrs. Smith.<br /><br />Ok, I was interested in this movie because of all of the hoopla about the stars Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. It is quite apparent that this movie brought this couple together. Many close scenes between the two, and Angelina Jolie is a beautiful woman. Brad Pitt, not my cup of tea, but obviously somebody likes him.<br /><br />The premise of this movie is a couple, who are both professional hired killers, not known to each other, lying about almost everything their entire married life; and now they have reached the 6 year mark in their marriage and are bored. A marriage made in heaven? A marriage based on lies by two people who have grown apart.  It is not until someone else decides that this couple as separate hired killers is not a good thing to have, that the action begins. The opening scenes where Smith and Smith meet each other in a Latin American Country are filled with attraction and lust and the most believable. After those scenes it is all downhill. However, this is a movie of action and science fiction, and the latest in gadgets of war and is fun. It becomes trite and silly at times and slightly overdone, but we forgive the stars because they are so attractive.  The other premise that this bored, married couple will suddenly see how much in love they are after they use every method known to man to kill each other is a little bizarre. However, if you are in the mood for an action flick, filled with beautiful people and the biggest collection of weapons in one movie, "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is for you.

I wasn't bowled over, but I wasn't dissapointed either.<br /><br />Fockers has some great comic moments and it is a hoot watching the old pros play against type in this one.  Hoffman and Streisand are a welcome addition to the family, but DeNiro again steals the film.<br /><br />Definitely worth a watch.  Or two.</p></body></html>

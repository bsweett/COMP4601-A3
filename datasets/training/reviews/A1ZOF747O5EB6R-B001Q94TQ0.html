<meta name="summary" content="Maria's Troubled Journey"></head><body><p>"Maria Full of Grace" is a touching, yet at times frightening, film that deserves a wider audience than those of the art house circuit.  Unfortunately, it has always been the case that films wholly or partly subtitled miss out on mass market distribution.  This is a shame.  Many such films, including "Maria", are truly excellent and deserve broader accolades than they receive.<br /><br />The story of "Maria" covers the life of Maria Alavarez (brilliantly played by Catalina Sandino Moreno) whose life revolves around providing for her mother, her sister and her sister's baby from the wages she earns dethorning roses in rural Colombia.  She hates her work and her boss.  Ultimately, she quits in frustration.  Coinciding with this, she realises that she is pregnant to her boyfriend who is probably best described as a loser.  Her life seems to have little upside.<br /><br />Maria's solution is to work as a mule in order to carry heroin from Bogota to New York.  It's a potentially lucrative trade.  She swallows 62 capsules of the drug.  Her journey is troubled as she escapes the authorities in New York simply because she is pregnant and therefore cannot be X-rayed.  She also sees the brutal and unrelenting side of the trade when one of her fellow mules is killed to retrieve the cargo she is carrying in her system.  Life in this business is cheap.<br /><br />Without revealing the end, it can be said that the film is great.  The characters are very plausible and the film seems to have no special axe to grind.  See this film for the strength of its characters.  Do not be persuaded otherwise simply because of the requirement to read subtitles.</p></body></html>

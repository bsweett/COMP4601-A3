<meta name="summary" content="F*** Yeah--this film rocks!"></head><body><p>I saw this film in theaters out of curiosity factor. I didn't know if I could sit through a 90+ minute film of puppets, but this surprised me with its humor and catchy songs. Trey Parker and Matt Stone really outdid themselves with this one. They achieved a near brilliant film...with only a few minor objectionable and possibly offensive scenes.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest controversial scene that required to be cut was the sex scene. Even though it is laughably funny the MPAA demanded cuts to this scene or risk an NC-17 rating, I do understand their decision. If parents brought their children thinking this was a "kid's movie"...the sex scene would have raised some uncomfortable questions from their children. Its a raunchy and funny scene that adults will get a kick out of. There is another scene that I wasn't sure if it was a parody of how Americans reacted to the Monica Lewinsky scandal (especially since we now know that Clinton was trying to go after Osama but Republicans in Congress claimed he was merely using Osama to distract Americans from "the real problem"--i.e. sex). The scene is funny, but it wasn't clear what the point was...other than to be as offensive as they could be.<br /><br />For me, the reason I detract a star is because I thought the vomiting scene went on too long and it was disgustingly tacky. I thought that scene would never end, as just when you think the puppet couldn't vomit any more, out comes another spew. Judging the laugher I heard in the theater, I guess for some people, the puppet could vomit for 30 minutes and still be funny, but I stopped laughing after the second time.<br /><br />I love the skewering this film does at the likes of Jerry Bruckheimer films (with a song about why the film "Pearl Harbor" sucked--which was so true), our nationalistic and macho aggression (with the song "America, F*** Yeah!"), the musical "Rent", evil dictators (I'm sure this film is banned in North Korea, with the Elmer Fuddish Kim Jong Il lisping "I'm so Ronery"), and most of all, pretentious Hollywood actors and their causes (watch out Sean Penn, Janeane Garofalo, Alex Baldwin). Everyone gets a deserved kick in the pants...conservatives and liberals. Who would be offended more by this film? I would put money on conservatives, since this film flaunts raunchiness in their faces (with the sex scenes and profanities). This film is a great satire about America as it was in 2004. I left the theaters still laughing with one song stuck in my head (the hard charging and macho "America, F*** Yeah!"). If you enjoy satire and don't get easily offended, buy this dvd and get the soundtrack as well. You'll be surprised how a movie about puppets can entertain and still make a point. The biggest point being...aren't we all puppets playing by someone else's hands (manipulation)? We need to cut the strings of our attachments and avoid both extremes...for they both have agendas more sinister than we realize. I'm glad someone had the courage to make this film.</p></body></html>

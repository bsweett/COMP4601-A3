The film interweaves three women's story's with a symbiotic thread. Nicole Kidman gives the performance of her career  with a nose for depression. Meryl Streep's performance is like watching your best friend in her kitchen as she prepares for a party and tells you about the friend she is going to honor that night. Julianne Moore plays a mother who loves too much but not enough. We follow each of these stories as they play out and weave in and out of each other's lives. The film is dramatic, shocking, and packed with powerful performances. You will love this film, but viewing it once is not enough. You will find a need to talk to with your friends and to discuss each nuance that disturbs or surprises you. See it with friends, prepare before you see it by reading a review or synopsis. You will be entranced and disturbed, but you will be able to devine more of your feelings and emotions after reviewing this film over and over in your mind.</p></body></html>

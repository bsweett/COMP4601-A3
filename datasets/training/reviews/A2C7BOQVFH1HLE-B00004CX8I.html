<meta name="summary" content="Shocking, Moving, Heartwarming, Powerful and One of the Best Ever!  Too Bad About the DVD!"></head><body><p>This movie is an all-time classic because it retains its ability to entertain and to move its audience over the years.  It's been 30 years but this film ages very well as its theme of power corrupting and the triumph of the human will over tyranny, injustice and downright evil intentions is still relevant today.  Add that to brilliant acting by Nicholson in his best ever performance in a role that seems to have been written just for him as well as by Fletcher who is so good in her role as Nurse Ratched ("Wretched")that she ranks among the top 10 of all time villainesses or bitches you'd love to stick a knife into.  This movie serves as a great metaphor for the triumph of the underdog over absolute power given to those who abuse it.  It was literally shocking for me to see (no pun intended) just how medieval and cruel "treatment" of the insane was (and hopefully not still is) in the 60s.  Released at about the time of the end of the Vietnam war this film would have struck a chord with audiences of the time experiencing something similar in trying to overcome injustices of the powers that be as symbolised by Nixon in how absolute power almost inevitably leads to corruption and the suffering of the true innocents.  This powerful movie will always be among my all-time favourites.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this dvd version is very poor as the picture quality has many imperfections such as white spots having not been restored and barely rises above VHS quality.  The sound quality is also poor having not been remastered.  My advice is to give this version a miss and to wait for a well restored and remastered version with at least Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound options as well as good Special Features to surface either in the standard or in the new Blu-ray formats.  Surely a classic like this deserves a lot better than this poor quality dvd version.<br /><br />Updated 27 June 2011: 4 stars<br /><br />Amazon won't let me do a separate review for this and so I'll append this here: the digibook blu-ray version of this film is certainly worth the upgrade.  The picture quality while not pristine perfect is much, much better than the dvd version I reviewed above.  The iritating white spots and other film imperfections have been removed although grain does appear at a few points throughout the film but not overly so to complain too much about.  The sound quality is also a vast improvement over the dvd coming in Dolby HD 5.1 surround although truth be told most of the sound is heavily front loaded on the original master anyway and as this film is really mostly dialogue driven the lack of true surround is not too disturbing.  The digibook itself is very nice to behold and I do confess to having a fancy for digibook blu-ray releases like this because it makes it easier for those who already have the dvd to want to double-dip.<br /><br />Undeniably great film content, vastly improved picture and sound quality and very nice digibook release makes this blu-ray release a high recommendation.</p></body></html>

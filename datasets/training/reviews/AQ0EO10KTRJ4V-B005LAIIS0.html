<meta name="summary" content="Hollywood's idea of nature ?"></head><body><p>The other reviewers do a good job pointing out the problem with this movie .<br />It seemed to fight with itself to decide what kind of movie it wanted to be .<br /><br />a) Serious survival story<br /><br />-or-<br /><br />b) Unrealistic supernatural CG! wolf-monster movie<br /><br />--or--<br /><br />c)  Symbolic movie about soul searching and self redemption<br /><br />Perhaps by trying to be three movies at once, it never quite succeeded at reaching its full potential on any of the levels.<br /><br />It was beautifully shot.<br />Great acting by all involved.<br />Well written dialog.<br /><br />Did a fair job of pulling you into their situation .........<br />BUT ............<br /><br />SOMETHING just didn't work and the film never really touches or grabs you.<br /><br />It's like a well done technical movie ... but missing a soul or spirit that gets to you.<br /><br />It's hard to place a finger on what exactly was missing in the movie, but it just kind of lumbered along ---- ended ...... and then was pretty forgetable.<br /><br />My wife just looked at me and went ......  "Hmmmmmm,  that's it ?"</p></body></html>

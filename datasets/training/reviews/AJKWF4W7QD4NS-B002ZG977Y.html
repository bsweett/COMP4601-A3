Sam Worthington, hot on the heels of the success of Avatar, stars as the demigod Perseus, whose father Zeus (Liam Neeson) has grown disillusioned and unhappy with how the humans worship the Gods of Olympus.  When Zeus' evil brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) plans on unleashing all hell upon the planet, Perseus leads a trek to stop him, before beautiful Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) is sacrificed.  The Clash of the Titans remake features the familiar creatures from the original film: Medusa, giant scorpions, harpies, and of course, the Kraken (Bubo is here too in a throwaway cameo).  However, in re-creating a modern update, the filmmakers forgot one vital thing in the process: making it fun to watch.  While there is a cavalcade of action and PG-13 rated violence, this new Clash of the Titans lacks any of the fun elements or charm of its predecessor.  The original film, while cheesy, campy, and oh so dated now, still has a degree of charm to it regardless because it's just plain fun to watch and easy to enjoy.  Here, the story and action are so mindless and boring that it's just hard to keep paying attention.  Acting-wise Worthington is solid, as are Gemma Arterton and Mads Mikkelsen as his allies on his journey, but no one else makes any sort of lasting impression.  The CGI effects are a mix of good and surprisingly sub-par, yet somehow, Perseus' battle with Medusa is worth the price of admission alone.  All in all, this new take on Clash of the Titans may be worthwhile for younger viewers who have no knowledge of the original film, but for the rest of us who grew up with the original Ray Harryhausen-effects featured film, it'd be for the best to just disregard this remake.</p></body></html>

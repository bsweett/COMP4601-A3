<meta name="summary" content="Silly and culturally patronising"></head><body><p>This is a silly film that does not deserve the plaudits it has been given. It plays to the current western ideology that the glorification of the self is the paramount aim in life, and money and celebrity are the great goals to pursue. The end is seamed predictably into the first scene, and the movie simply unraps its layers towards the inevitable conclusion. The tension built into the narrative is Disney schmaltz - that is, we are happy to follow the characters through their mistakes and hardships because we know all will come out right in the end.<br /><br />This is not how life, let alone life in slum communities in India works. If such a film was made about American society it would be pilloried as a piece of Hollywood feelgood pap, profiting out of the naive chimera of the American Dream, as experienced by the poor. Set in India, it offers only a few colourful set pieces that show the hardships of slum life, rather than doing much to intelligently challenge and educate our perceptions of such societies.</p></body></html>

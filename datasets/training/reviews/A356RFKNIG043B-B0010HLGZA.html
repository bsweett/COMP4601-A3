I liked it last week, though, and wished I had seen it as a boy so I could have used it to convince my folks to get me a bb gun!<br />My mom said "You'll shoot your eye out" pretty often too. It's a good line, one of the few I had no decent comeback to. "I've got two" never seemed very impressive. Fortunately I still do have both eyes, and they enjoyed this movie. It's well-written and moves along nicely. McGavin is exceptionally funny at times...the Night Stalker as family man.<br />Don't let your boy see this unless you're ready to have the "bb-gun talk"!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ho hum, hi-tech version of classic comic book"></head><body><p>The long awaited and much bally-hoo'ed movie version of Marvel Comics' THE FANTASTIC FOUR is an unfortunate disappointment.  Long winded and bogged down in "Origin," the film lacks any kind of POV from the writer or director, so it's consequently as one-dimensional as the very comic book on whichi it's based.  That would be fine if it were a cartoon or half-hour action series, but one liners, cute gimmicks and bathroom humor does not a movie make.<br /><br />The skills of an extremely talented cast are woefully wasted, but there's plenty of high tech visuals, special effects and noise for kids in search of a matinee-style adventure flicks.  But, no sequel, please!</p></body></html>

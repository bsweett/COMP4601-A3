<meta name="summary" content="Ray is worth seeing"></head><body><p>How much of Ray is historically accurate?  I suspect that Director Taylor Hackford took many liberties.  Still, there is enough here to get a sense of the late Ray Charles' often turbulent life.  Jamie Foxx is unbelievable fantastic as the great singer who had to overcome both racial prejudice and blindness.  Ray is no saint and his womanizing and heroin abuse are not hidden.  The man had to overcome extreme poverty, blindness, and racism.  Ray's career essentially did not begin until he was in his early thirties.  We learn about the influence of his mother in preparing him for life's challenges.  Why did Ray's wife put up with his philandering? The film didn't adequately address the reason for her not leaving him.  I also wanted to know a little more about Ray's battle against segregation.<br /><br />The audience hears many of Ray Charles' songs.  This makes the movie worth it on that level alone.  The man was truly a musical genius.  We are blessed that he shared his gift with us.  May we never forget him.</p></body></html>

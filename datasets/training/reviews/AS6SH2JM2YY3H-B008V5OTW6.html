The Israel Olympians in Munich were killed by terrorists.  People associated with Black September were later killed.<br /><br />How this was done, who did it, and where everything happened was something Steven Spielberg tried to establish for the viewer.  Remember JFK?<br /><br />This is another of those movies that grays the area between fact and fiction, reality and speculation.  I doubt that the team leader of the Israel assassins was so obsessed with the victims at Munich.  In reality, he would probably have been more focused on those he killed, and the families he destroyed.  This is the nature of war, and post-traumatic shock.<br /><br />This was a movie on a gruesome and troubling topic: terrorism and retaliation.  It is sad through and through.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pie Hopes, Comedy, and Delicious Drama"></head><body><p>Waitress is a story of a small town waitress, Jenna (Keri Russell), with a knack for creating fantastic tasty pies.  She works in a diner with two waitress friends, has a childish, jealous, self-centered husband, Earl (Jeremy Sisto), and a dream to win a $25,000 pie baking contest, open her own pie shop and change her unfulfilling life.<br /><br />The beginning scene shows Jenna taking a pregnancy test that shows positive.  She is now facing having an unplanned child as she was also planning on leaving her abusive husband.  She then bakes "I Don't Want an Earl's Baby Pie - a quiche of egg and cheese with a smoked ham center.<br /><br />When she visits her OB-GYN she finds she is replaced by a young, somewhat disorganized newcomer to town.  He is handsome but married.  Jenna and the new Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion) are attracted to each other and soon start a relationship that opens Jenna up to other possibilities in life.  She can make her own decisions in life.<br /><br />Several pies are concocted in Jenna's mind at critical moments in her life.  Interludes during the film show a pie being made as Jenna narrates the ingredients.<br /><br />The film finds flavor with Jenna's quick-tongued fellow waitresses along with classic television star Andy Griffith who plays Joe, the wise owner of the diner.  There is delicious drama during the fun, and although adultery is conducted as a sidebar, it looks like the characters just want a piece of happiness in their small quiet lives.<br /><br />Overall Waitress is an optimistic entertaining comedy and a story of dream fulfillment.</p></body></html>

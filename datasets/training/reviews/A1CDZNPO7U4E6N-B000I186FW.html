It shows how a government based on greed oppresses it's people by means of prejudice, invoking fear, censorship, and curfews. It gives you a look at how the media misinforms and misleads the people intentionally with false information. This movie is about a country needing one fearless leader, icon, or symbol willing to stand up and speak against these injustices. They get it in the form of a masked individual known simply as "V". "V" is all about starting a revolution to overthrow the government, so the people can take back their country and freedom without fear or reservations. Personally, I don't think this movie is pro-Bush or anti-Bush, but I do think it's left up to you to make the call, or interpret it as you will. All I know is, as far as entertainment value goes it was great. Natalie Portman was wonderful, and she still looked beautiful without hair. This movie gets..THUMBS UP!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Romero Returns To Remind Us How It's Supposed To Be Done..."></head><body><p>I really wanted to see this movie when it came out in theaters, as I have become quite the George Romero enthusiast over the past few years and there hasn't been a new "Dead" movie in almost 20 years (if you exclude the remakes). But unfortunately, it dropped out of theaters just as fast as it arrived. But here, it arrives in all it's "Unrated Director's Cut" glory. It's surprising this movie didn't do very well, afterall, it was obviously only greenlit after the runaway success of zombie flicks such as last year's flacid remake of "Dawn Of The Dead," "28 Days Later" and to a lesser extent, "Shaun Of The Dead" (whose creators appear in this movie). Don't let the box office disappointment steer you away from this flick though...<br /><br />"Land Of The Dead" is 100 percent George Romero. All of the elements that made the original "Dead" movies such classics are carried over here. Great characters, original and thoughtful story, loads of action, and let us not forget: gore galore. The special effects truly steal the show here, as this is hands down the goriest movie I have seen in a long time (although, I'm sure much of it was trimmed down in theaters). The effects look real, unlike most newer horror flicks, and are a refreshing throwback to the 70's and 80's. As for the cast? Dennis Hopper, John Leguizamo, Simon Baker, Asia Argento. What more can I say? Dennis Hopper is great as the greedy, self-appointed leader of a new society, John Leguizamo is perfect as the badass rebel looking for a way out, Simon is his opposite, the sympathetic hero and Asia (whose father, Dario, has close connections with Romero) plays the strong female bit, and a semi-love interest to Baker's character. The story picks up exactly where "Day Of The Dead" left off. Now that the Dead (or "stenches," as they are referred to) have pretty much overtaken Earth, the upper-class citizens (i.e. those with money) have holed themselves up in a giant complex that serves as a new world, while the rest of the population are forced to fend for themselves on the street. There are obvious political undertones in this film that reflect on today's society (the supplemental material on the DVD further confirmed my theories) and in typical Romero fashion, it is pulled off very maturely, while still managing to entertain.<br /><br />The movie isn't exactly perfect. My main gripe is that it is too short for it's own good. What I love about Romero's flicks is how you can get sucked into this alternate world he creates. Here, just as I was getting hooked, the movie was ending. But even still, it works well in it's 95 minute slot. All the actors were great in their roles, and the characters were well-written, despite the fact that there wasn't much time for exposition (I wish we could have gotten to see and gotten to know more of Argento's character though), and the best part: The zombies in this movie are REAL zombies. Not rabid, blood-thirsty animals. Don't get me wrong, I like today's zombie flicks, but nobody does it like George, and "Land Of The Dead" is a testament to that.</p></body></html>

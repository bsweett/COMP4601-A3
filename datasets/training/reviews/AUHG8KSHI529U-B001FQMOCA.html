<meta name="summary" content="A very good movie - much better than I had expected"></head><body><p>Let me start by saying that I have never been a huge fan of Johnny Cash and that my taste in music runs to Classical, so I am not a likely target for this movie.  However, I want to tell you that I liked it very much.  The movie portrays Cash as a very complex freight train of talent and emotion that is on some very loose and greased tracks ready to careen off a precipice at any moment.  The Cash in the movie had a certain kind of strength on stage, but off stage was something more like a black hole of emotional needs.  Of course, some would say that someone who needs all that approbation on stage is likely going to keep need it when the curtain falls and the lights are off.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix does a remarkable job of pulling of this man's very unique look and sound and facial expressions.  But it is more than a simple imitation or even "channeling" Cash as so many have said.  You can look at the actor's face and tell what Cash is feeling and trying to put into thoughts and when he fails to find the right thoughts, he erupts in frustration.  Just a superb job of acting and a tribute to Cash.<br /><br />Ginnifer Goodwin does a fine job in making Cash's first wife sympathetic, understandable, and yet never quite a victim.  We understand why the marriage broke down and why it started badly with different expectations from two very different people.  However, Cash's vast emotional needs and charisma seems to have drawn her in, but the pressures and storms that come with the huge fame Cash gained are not compatible with the kind of domesticity Vivian wanted.<br /><br />The person that Cash finally met, wanted, and needed as June Carter.  She had her own baggage coming from "Country Music Royalty" and a couple of bad marriages.  However, she seems to have had greater intellectual clarity and was probably smarter than Johnny Cash.  Reese Witherspoon gives a wonderful performance that wins our sympathy and helps focus our own attitudes towards the storms in Cash's life at any given moment in the film.<br /><br />Robert Patrick and Shelby Lynne add just the right touches as Cash's parents Ray and Carrie Cash.  Patrick has to provide the foundation for Cash's emotional insecurity and Lynne the music for him to cling to for emotional sustenance.<br /><br />This is a much better movie than I expected and I am glad that they left things complex and mixed rather than trying to turn this into a moralizing or cautionary story - though there are moral issues and cautionary lessons to draw aplenty.<br /><br />Enjoy.</p></body></html>

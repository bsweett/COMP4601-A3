<meta name="summary" content="Its not that good."></head><body><p>L.A. Confidential revives the glorious tradition of the film noir genre, or at least it tries.  It stars some of the most famous actors of the last few years, but none of them are interesting.  Basically it is the story of an honest cop caught in a corrupt police department.  Sound familiar?  A certain actor by the name of Al Pacino starred in a certain movie called 'Serpico'.  There are numerous fights and shootouts distracting the audience, making them forget the jumbled mess of the story.  'L.A. Confidential' jumps from one small story to the next without any kind of coherency.  There seemed to be no focus at all .  A love triangle exists between Bud White and Kim Basinger, but it is flat and contrived, and the only thing Basinger is good at is looking pretty.  All of a sudden the honest cop has sex with her.  Why in the world did he do this and what purpose does it serve?  I know what purpose it serves; it keeps the audience awake and distracts them even more.  An implausable shootout happens in the end where all the good guys survive and bad guys die.  And in the end the pretty girl kisses the hero.  Whoa, talk about a modern cinematic masterpiece.</p></body></html>

There was the usual mayhem that arises very quickly when people are trapped in one place together, within a day or two in books and movies they start acting crazy and give aliens and monsters reasons to mock us, for trying to end our lives when things go wrong or there is no way out. Well this was no exception, when a small Maine town ( hey it's a King story, of course it's in Maine) gets enveloped in a thick, cloying mist, those fortunate enough who have escaped early can wave goodbye to their friends and family members because something strange is happening and the chances of any survivors are glum.<br /><br />When David Drayton and his son make a quick trip to the supermarket for supplies after an electrical storm, they have no idea that the store will be their salvation and damnation at the same time. Once the store door closes and the fog closes in, screams in the distance tell everyone that this is no ordinary case of bad weather, not only is it mysterious but it houses creepy creatures that honestly scared and shocked me. The first time David encounters the blood hungry things in the mist is an unforgettable experience, paranoia adds another layer of terror as people who don't believe him need to see it for themselves and that is the beginning of the end. This horror flick was a lot of fun but also kept me in great suspense for almost the entire time, a little draining but worth it except I don't recommend getting too attached to any characters....some of them didn't last very long, and the ways their last moments ended were truly excruciating.<br /><br />The movie was pretty fast paced; the acting realistic enough and the creatures were not all CG, so that was refreshing. Highly recommended for lovers of suspense and terror and of course banging endings, this one was shocking and quite honestly very raw, almost painful in a strange way when no amount of relief the ending brought could erase the events that perspired before the last minutes.<br /><br />- Kasia S.</p></body></html>

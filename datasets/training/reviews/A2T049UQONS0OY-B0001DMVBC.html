Taken from the book of the same name, the story revolves around a dispute about a repossessed home sold to an immigrant family headed by a strong father figure (Ben Kingsley). The homeowner, sexpot turned actress Jennifer Connelley, is wrongfully evicted and seeks to get back her property.<br /><br />The story details her meandering life in eviction and the Greek tragedy of her life -- husband left her, father worked all his life for the home she lost, new boyfriend betrays wife and children to be with her. Meanwhile, the new owner -- an expatriate military leader in the Shah of Iran's regime -- seeks to return to some of the good life his family led in their homeland, in part by getting the house, fixing it up and selling it for a big profit.<br /><br />Unfortunately, no one in this film gets what they want. In fact, they all get more trouble than they want. If their lives were tragic before they met this house of sand and fog, they began to live in utter despair afterward. It should instead be called the house of broken dreams, for its residents have their hopes and lives shattered by involvement with it.<br /><br />The production team interspersed scenes of rapid sky, fog, cloud and sea movement during intervening moments of the drama. This adds to the aura of despair, which is overwhelming during the film's 125 minutes. There is a singular lack of hope and optimism in this movie that will send a lot of viewers home satisfied but unfulfilled.<br /><br />Other fine dramas find a way to send viewers home without this desultory pessimism. One of the finest negative affect dramas ever, 1980's "Ordinary People", found a way to locate optimism at the end even after the mother had left home. Even "The Perfect Storm" found a way to assuage the pain of its stars all perishing at sea with a memorial service for them. They should have done something similar with "House of Sand and Fog" to give viewers a reason to have hope.</p></body></html>

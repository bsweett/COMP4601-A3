<meta name="summary" content="VINTAGE SCI-FI GENRE CLASSIC."></head><body><p>Without giving away any details of the plot - for its best to watch for yourself - just know that this is a superb entry into the realm of Sci-fi flicks! FORBIDDEN PLANET offers the viewer an exceptionally intelligent script, fine direction and excellent acting by the entire cast who are threatened by a strange being on an exotic planet. In the year 22OO A.D., commander Leslie Nielson lands his United Planets Cruiser C-57D on Altair-4 where the sky is green the sand is pink, and two moons circle above...For its day, the technical achievements for the film were astounding. It was the first science fiction film produced by a major studio (M-G-M) for a million dollars. The eerie musical score, the atmosphere, even the odd Eastmancolor all add to the film's immense enjoyment. The film is essentially (and rather ingeniously) a futuristic variation/fantasia on Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST: an undeniably brilliant excursion into outer space and the inner mind.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A GREAT RELEASE TO TAKE FULL  ADVANTAGE FROM HI-DEF."></head><body><p>This film is visually stunning in HD-DVD. I bought it a few days ago and already saw it three times!!!<br /><br />That 30's and 40's look is dazzling.<br /><br />I love Gweneth Paltrow, Jude Law and Angelina Jolie. They really work fine... but this film is a true feast for the eye with all the flight scenes and and robots and battle scenes...<br /><br />Gorgeous in HD-DVD. A true cinematic experience!!!<br /><br />HD-DVD is worth every dollar! Don't take just my word. Check the reviews on the players.</p></body></html>

This is the kind of film that can be watched multiple times and one still finds things to enjoy in it.  The Amazon review and synopsis really cover the basics of this film, but the heart of this film belongs to one line said by Nicholson, "You make me want to be a better man."<br /><br />We are all victims of our circumstances and idiosyncracies at times, but we need to strive to get past them.  This is typified in Nicholson's line quoted above to Helen Hunt's character and in his later lines when he barges into his psychologist's office unannounced and where he complains about such conduct until Jack cuts him off with, "You can't treat me for obssessive complusive disorders and then complain about when I committ such actions like I have a choice in the matter."  Hysterical and all too true.<br /><br />This is a truly moving film with real life like characters that we grow to appreciate if not love.  I just love pulling this film down off my shelf to watch every so often.  My wife and I love it every time we watch it.  It's the kind of film that never gets old.  Nicholson is reliable and believable as always, and Helen Hunt is so much better than she's often given credit for being.  She is smart, beautiful, relatable, and enormously talented.  Greg Kinnear really shows that he has acting chops and his career following this film has proven that his performance here was no fluke.<br /><br />This movie soars on every level.  This film is as good as it gets it.</p></body></html>

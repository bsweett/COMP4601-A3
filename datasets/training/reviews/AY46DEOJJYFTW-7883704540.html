<meta name="summary" content="Pixar magic!"></head><body><p>Pixar is amazing, not only does their animation blow away everyone else, the characters and plot lines are deeper and more compelling. Great fun with some real poignant moments. I had to warm up to a movie about a rat, I have this thing about rats, but in a way the movie plays up to this fear and eventually you will find yourself wrapped up in this film. It is funny, wonderful and enchanting. Oh yeah, the kids loved it too! It is the "hot" film right now, their fav, the INCREDIBLES and NEMO used to hold this estemmed perch. That ole Pixar magic strikes again!</p></body></html>

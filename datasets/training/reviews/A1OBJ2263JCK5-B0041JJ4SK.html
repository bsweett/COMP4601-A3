Good examples include "Dazed & Confused" (my personal favorite), "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" and of course "Cheech & Chong's classic "Up in Smoke". These films and others like it usually involve severely stoned characters having some pretty hilarious adventures, while being under the influence. But here's something I've never been able to figure out. Why does Hollywood always portray the 'Stoners' as being the most dim witted, moronic people in the room? What if you made a movie, where the 'Stoners' happened to be the smartest people in the room? Well now my question has been answered with the DVD release of the falling down, hilarious film comedy, "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle". In the film we meet our two wiley protaganists of the title, Harold & Kumar. Harold (John Cho) is a staightlaced numbers cruncher for a big securities corporation. The weekend is about to start, but his sleazy boss dumps even more work on him at quitting time. Meanwhile, Harold's love life is on hold, because he's to wimpy to say something to the sexy dream girl, who lives in his apartment building. Harold's best friend is Kumar (Kal Penn), a fast talking smart a**, who is barely going through the motions of looking like he's interested in getting into medical school. Actually his interests are more along the lines of procuring good dope and getting laid. The weekend starts and our two heroes are sitting at home getting 'high as a kite' as they watch "sixteen Candles" on the tube. This naturally leads to a killer case of the 'munchies'. But just the ordinary pizza, Chinese or KFC is not going to do the trick. They need the 'Everest' of junk food, namely 'White Castle's' little tasty Hamburgers (known as 'sliders'). The boys drive off into the night going on their long and insanely funny quest to find these delicious morsels of meat. Along the way they meet up with horny college girls, the Korean Students Assoc., a grotesque trucker & his sexy wife, nasty skinheads, out of control fascist cops, an escaped cheetah and even a drug fueled, hooker obsessed, 'Doogie Howser'! I think, what I like about this film is that it plays out like a live action version of a "Looney Tunes" cartoon . The two main characters are instantly likable. Kumar is like a cross between Bugs Bunny & Groucho Marx, using his fast wit to solve any obstacle or problem. Harold is Kumar's straightman (his Zeppo Marx) constantly staying on the straight and narrow until he's pushed just too far! Together the two have great chemistry together, which is greatly aided by the fast and funny script. Like a good episode of "South Park", this witty movie chooses to make fun of everything and everyone that crosses it's path. It doesn't matter what your ethnic background, religion, sexual preference or occupation is. It's an equal opprutunity offender with hilarious results! The DVD to this film is well put together. It includes, what must be one of the best menu's ever put on DVD. The two lead characters are driving in there car criticizing and making fun of the viewer for not picking the different menu options. It goes on for quite a while and it's really funny! This 'Extreme Unrated' version includes deleted scenes and outtakes, a back seat interview with the actors, commentaries and even a documentary on the making of the 'diarrhea' scene, sound effects! For an evening of great 'stoner comedy' get "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle"! Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

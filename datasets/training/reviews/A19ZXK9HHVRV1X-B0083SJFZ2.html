It was further distinguished by having a number of acting legends of both stage and screen (i.e., Lawrence Olivier, Maggie Smith) slumming their way through the project - and obviously having the time of their professional lives doing so.<br /><br />The 2010 version, directed by Louis Leterrier, trades in star power and campiness for improved special effects and a more straightforward action-movie approach to the material (though Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes do appear as Zeus and Hades, respectively).<br /><br />Sam Worthington stars as Persius, the demi-god son of Zeus, who leads the humans in a war against the gods, whom he blames for the deaths of his adoptive parents and little sister.  Persius also must face-down and defeat the mighty Kracken, a terrifying, indestructible beast that serves as the gods' ultimate weapon against the people.<br /><br />It's all very Saturday-matinee juvenilia in spirit and tone, but the pacing is swift, the special effects impressive, and the various and sundry monsters and creatures sufficiently imaginative and larger-than-life to make us suspend our disbelief, if only for the duration.<br /><br />Good fun.</p></body></html>

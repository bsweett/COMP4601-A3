<meta name="summary" content="Good, but not great DVD features and flick."></head><body><p>There are several very good reviews already written on this movie, `I, Robot', most of which accurately point out the fact that, as the movie admits itself in the credits, is only loosely based on the collection of short stories by Isaac Asimov. I'm prompted to write a review of the DVD, because while all these reviews talk about the movie, none of them talk about the DVD.<br /><br />The most important thing about this package is that while it does not include a lot of special features a la `Matrix' and `Lord of the Rings' blockbusters, it does include my favorite feature, which is an alternate soundtrack containing commentary by the writer and the director. This single feature automatically doubles the value of the package as it gives an excellent reason to watch the movie a second time. I really prefer the alternate soundtrack approach to the captions commonly done with older movies, as there is typically much more information given and you can get much more from the intonation of the speakers than you can from the sterile text.<br /><br />That said, I believe the commentary soundtrack on this DVD is not as good as some of the best I have heard. My favorite is those by Kevin Smith, who has been known to supply two different commentary tracks and almost always has a symposium of three or four voices joining his own. A fairer comparison may be to the commentary track on Quentin Tarantino's special edition of `Pulp Fiction'. As both Smith and Tarantino are well known for including obscure `quotes' and references in their flicks, their commentary tracks are especially useful in revealing all the connections.<br /><br />As this movie is loosely based on a justly famous collection of short stories and liberally quotes from other Sci Fi classics such as `2001' and the 1930's Czech play `Rossum's Universal Robots (R.U.R)', this commentary track should be a goldmine, but it is not. While the speakers mention or allude to these references, they give very few concrete connections. I'm convinced that the actor who did the voice of `Sonny', the primary robot character took his queue from the voice of HAL in `2001', but the commentators give me no satisfaction. As the play R.U.R. is a much bigger source for the plot, I was a bit disappointed that this connection was not explored more fully.<br /><br />As there is a direct connection between Will Smith and Kevin Smith, as Will Smith had a cameo in Kevin's last movie, `Jersey Girl', I must point out that both Kevin Smith and the principles of `I, Robot' both have immense respect for Will Smith's talent as a professional movie actor in both courtesy to others and in his artistic contribution to the script and the quality of his improvisations on screen.<br /><br />On the other hand, I found the Susan Calvin character (played by Bridget Monaghan) to be almost entirely uninteresting. She would have been much stronger if she had been played as originally written by Asimov or closer to the Sean Young character in `Blade Runner', the movie I sense the authors were trying their darndest to match. They didn't even come close, primarily, I suspect due less to Will Smith's weakness than to the failure to match Ridley Scott's powerful world based on the great inventions of the original material's writer, Philip K. Dick. `I, Robot' had no hope of matching `Blade Runner', as the latter was much less an action / FX opus than a classic Sci Fi `what if' premise grafted seamless to a film noir atmosphere and imaginative Pacific Rim fusion Los Angles. The driving force of `Blade Runner' is the fact that the androids are designed to die after four years. Asimov's great invention of the three laws of robotics are useful as wallpaper, but do not, ultimately explain the action in the film. They are a red herring used by characters to doubt what is really going on. Oddly, while I found the acting behind the primary robot, `Sonny' to be very good, the writing for this character was very inconsistent. And, inconsistency is highly implausible in a computer-based life form. I was expecting something much closer to the character R. Daneel Olivaw from Asimov's two early robot detective novels, `The Naked Sun' and `The Caves of Steel', where the phobias of the principle human are much more consistent with the world posited by Asimov for the stories.<br /><br />This is certainly a worthwhile Sci Fi movie, although not in the class of `Blade Runner', `Minority Report', or even that great old classic `Forbidden Planet'. Good for a fun evening and a worthwhile second viewing with the commentary track.</p></body></html>

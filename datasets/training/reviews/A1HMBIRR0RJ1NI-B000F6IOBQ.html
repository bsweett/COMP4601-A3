<meta name="summary" content="The Evolution Has Begun!"></head><body><p>"Underworld: Evolution" is a very apt name for the second installment of "Underworld." Gone are many of the characters of the last film, or their dispatched very quickly in the beginning 15 minutes, with bloody relish by Marcus, who has awakened from blood pouring out of the Lycan scientist's head from the first movie.<br /><br />This is a immediate continuation of the first, & it has claws & fangs to spare! As Kraven & entourage are still trying to take over the Vampire coven, by dispatching Marcus, the last head Vampire, & the first true Vampire. Little do they know what grisly fate awaits them!<br /><br />Tony Curran as "Marcus," plays his role with demonic glee as he slashes, bites, stabs, his way through this film in search for the key & hiding place of his Werewolf twin brother William, who has been imprisoned forever is a standing metal coffin like prison. Marcus, deceived by Viktor in a very well done prologue to the movie's beginning, where Viktor is hunting down William, promising not to hurt him, captures William in a brutal all out attack. Marcus protests Viktor treatment of his brother, "you're killing him! William!" Viktor replies, "say his name one more time & you've chosen his fate." Marcus then succumbs to Viktor, & says, "What is thy wish, my Lord." The story has begun!<br /><br />Selene (Kate Bekinsale) & Michael (Scott Speedman) are on the run from the Vampires for killing Viktor in the first film, & a very persistent Marcus that wants information Selene has of his brothers whereabouts. In just a awe striking scene, Marcus in the form of full fledge flying Demon like Vampire, chases a truck driven by Selene, & fight ensues with Michael in the back of the truck. Nary do fighting/chase scenes in horror movies get better. Marcus's make up & CGI are just done to perfection, like a flying nightmare. Not since "Bram Stokers Dracula," have I seen such a convincing non-human form Vampire. I do have to say though, that Marcus's true Vampire self reminds me of "the Creeper," from "Jeepers Creepers," but just like "the Creeper," he is unstoppable!<br /><br />Also showing up in this story filled with many plot twist & turns is the first immortal himself, Alexander Corvinus, father of Marcus & William in a role you would not expect, but this is a film of unexpected turns, one as god as the last!<br /><br />"Underworld: Evolution" is superior to it predecessor in just about everyway! Fast moving, plot twisting, effects laden spectacular with fine uniform acting. If you love the Vampire & Werewolf sub-genres at all, you won't want to miss this film!<br /><br />4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece</p></body></html>

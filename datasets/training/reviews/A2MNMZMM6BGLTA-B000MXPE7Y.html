<meta name="summary" content="Very Good w/ one flaw"></head><body><p>I enjoyed this movie very much. Everything about it was good. There is only one flaw that was very distracting to me. Everybody in the movie ages... everybody but Matt Damon. He looks exactly the same as an aging CIA man as he did when he was a young homoerotic Skull and Bones pledge. Other than that I thought the movie was great. Oh, and casting John Boy Walton as Damons son was kind of bad too. The guy wasn't bad but he was the A-typical 'weakling son of the strong dad' role.</p></body></html>

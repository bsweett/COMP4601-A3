<meta name="summary" content="Awesome, one of Tom Cruise's best ever"></head><body><p>Forget MI2, this is the Cruise movie you want to see.  It's long, but the story gets deeper and deeper as you go right up to a surprise ending.  My only complaint is this is like the millionth movie in the last year with Colin Farrell.  Enough is enough with him, he's not that good of an actor but he's been in WAY WAY WAY to many movies lately.  Anyway, back to minority report.  Very cool special effects.  Great story.  You won't be dissapointed.  Everyone runs!</p></body></html>

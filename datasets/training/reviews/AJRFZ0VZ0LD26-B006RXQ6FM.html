I have found it to be so compelling on many different levels.  Meryl Streep plays a nun in the middle private school that is stern where even a local priest calls her a "dragon".  She is a school principal dedicated to discipline, tradition and propriety.  School priest in the other hand is likable, he is popular with students and seemingly easy going.  However, the mutual dislike between him and the principal leads them both to a different level of intellectual battlefield.<br /><br />Nun is concerned about priest's close relationship with one of the school students that also happens ot be black.  Her suspicions are confirmed in one of the most stunning moments in the film when nun meets boys mother (shinning star actress Viola Davis).  The revelation between the two women about the boy's present state and his future is the soul of the movie.  Both nun and mother wish the best for the school and the young man, but what shall be the price of securing his destiny and the well being of the students of the school?<br /><br />"Doubt" is about crisis of faith, of individual's choosing to do the right things and any decent person's making moral transgressions for the greater good. People's actions and outside demeanor is not always a reflection of the purity of their soul.  At the end, we learn that everyone has a price to pay for their actions and their internal struggles. Wonderful movie, great performances.</p></body></html>

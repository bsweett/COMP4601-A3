<meta name="summary" content="The one movie Ridley Scott should have gotten an Oscar for!"></head><body><p>When this movie came out, I was in awe of its technical and visual effects.  But it's the story and script that makes this movie one of the great Sci-Fi films of all time.  There are more scary moments in this film than in any horror movie ever made.  It's unforgettable and should have been given more awards than it was given.  A wild ride!  Be prepared!</p></body></html>

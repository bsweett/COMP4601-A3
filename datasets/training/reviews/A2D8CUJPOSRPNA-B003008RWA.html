<meta name="summary" content="The Awful Truth About Our Health Care System"></head><body><p>Leave it to cinematic muckraker and agent provocateur Michael Moore to stir up the pot again.  For the third time in less than five years, this renegade has made it his business to take on the powers-that-be on celluloid.  In 2002, it was the gun lobby with BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE; in 2004, it was the Bush cabal in FAHRENHEIT 9/11.  And now with SICKO, he takes on the issue of health insurance, or lack thereof, in America.<br /><br />As Moore himself says at the outset, SICKO isn't necessarily about the fifty million Americans who have no health insurance to begin with.  It is about all the rest of us who do, and who are of the belief that our health insurance carriers will cover the cost of needed drugs or operations, come what may.  But the awful truth about health insurers in particular, and the health care system in general, is that they can deny a claim for any asinine reason to maximize profits.  In essence, this means that every single one of us might be just one illness or one rejected claim away either from financial destitution or, at the very worst, Death itself.  And as always, Moore sardonically goes up against the HMO/pharmaceutical bureaucracy that not only allows this to happen, but also has every elected official in Washington in their pocket so as to make doubly sure that universal health care never becomes a reality in America--brainwashing them, and the American people at large, into thinking of such a system as "socialized medicine", one step removed from a Commie-like bureaucracy.<br /><br />But piece by piece, Moore shows us the inherent fallacy of such a notion.  First, he shows us a couple of dozen ordinary Americans hit hard by HMOs who will not approve for needed treatment or operations, thus resulting either in bankruptcy or death.  Then he shows how "socialized medicine" works in Canada, England, and France--quite well, thank you very much: high rates of healthy people; low infant mortality; people who live quite well off; and doctors who don't have to worry about an HMO approving or turning down potentially life-saving treatment, they just DO IT.  What does that say about America, which ranked at #37 on the World Health Organization's list of best health care in the world--just barely ahead of provincial Slovenia?!<br /><br />Then, to add insult to injury (no pun intended), Moore takes several emergency workers who were at Ground Zero on 9/11 to receive treatment outside the U.S., after these workers were told that the treatment they needed either couldn't be done or wouldn't be paid for by the powers-that-be.  And where do they all go?  Cuba--a nation we've had an embargo against since October 1962; a nation whose ruler generations of Americans have learned to despise with every fiber of their being!  And what kind of treatment do these 9/11 heroes get?  The best!  How can one NOT be outraged by the fact that one of the last remaining bastions of the Red Menace can give Americans better health care than their own government?!<br /><br />SICKO, like almost everything Moore has ever done, be it movies or books, has been attacked by the HMO/pharmaceutical complex, whose lobbying power in Washington is exceeded only by the dreaded military/industrial complex.  If it had been only one or two HMO horror stories that made the news in the last twenty years, they might have had a legitimate beef.  But Moore has given us dozens here; and we know of thousands of others--and this includes hospitals dumping indigent patients on L.A.'s Skid Row.  This state of affairs should not be happening here in America, but it is, thanks to the HMOs and the pharmaceutical giants.<br /><br />Yes, what Michael Moore advocates--a universal health care system, presumably funded out of a percentage of our taxes--would mean the collapse of the medical bureaucracy.  But unless we have such a system in place that puts decisions of life and death in the hands of doctors and not political lackeys, being the richest country in the world as we are is going to be negated by us having the worst human rights record in the world.  Health care cannot and should not be a privilege.  As SICKO and its creator so eloquently state, it should be a human RIGHT!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Play the game instead."></head><body><p>This director really has only one good movie - "Event Horizon" - and everything else is just plain bad, Resident Evil being absolutely no exception to this general rule of thumb and God help "Aliens Vs Predator" with the way things are shaping up.<p>This film is marginally better than Ghosts of Mars, but only because Milla Jovovich goes around the place in a really very short mini-skirt and just happens to get skin sticking wet clothes towards the end of the picture. Overall the movie has extremely low production values and even lower prospects in the execution of the film. All of the sets looked contrived, i.e - they have no point being there other than to match scenes in the computer game or look interesting. Oh, yeah did we mention that this is based on a computer game? No, okay lets back up a bit here... Resident Evil just happens to be a really popular 3rd person zombie shoot 'em up horror survival game that they are now selling as a movie. Okay, let's move on...<p>When the actors in this film are more robotic than the characters in the game then you know something has gone seriously wrong... and it has. Nobody in the cast is mildly recognizable except for Milla Jovovich, and they shouldn't be either, because they all suck real bad. The camera work is some of the worse seen in a long time. Why? Because it attracts attention itself almost all of time. Bad cinematography. For 35mm it looks like it was shot on video. The lighting is pretty good whenever it turns on or off but when it is static it is just useless. The editing is extremely bad at times and cuts fail to match. From an atheistic standpoint its all terrible production values for a Hollywood budget. The CGI also happens to be extremely, EXTREMELY, dodgy most of the times. You know when the animation looks like animation? Well x 100 times worse is what you get here. It looks terribly fake, and even the dogs covered in RED PAINT look very cheesy. Overall this is a really really really very bad production. The story is worse and even some of the.......<p>Bah.<p>Forget about me writing anymore. Not worth it. Just go play the game instead.</p></body></html>

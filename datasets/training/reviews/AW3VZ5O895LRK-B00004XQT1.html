<meta name="summary" content="My Film Listserv Was Right In Recommending This"></head><body><p>I was unable to make it beyond 50 pages in the incredibly grisly novel version of &quot;American Psycho&quot; written by Ellis.  However, my film group assured me that the movie version was an utter transformation of the novel and Christian Bale, as the lead, a major acting discovery.  The group was right. Rewritten with black humor at its core, this tale of the consummate yuppie of the 1980s, who is also a serial killer, held me spellbound, when I wasn't LOL.  Bale is also interviewed on the DVD version and you can barely tell he is the same person as the character he plays, Patrick Bateman.  This is not a mad-slasher film like &quot;Nightmare On Elm Street&quot;.  So if you are looking for that kind of film, this will not fit the bill.  This is an exploration of the dark underside of a Harvard educated, privileged young CEO and his cohorts on Wall Street and the &quot;horror&quot; is how right the film feels. There is the issue raised of how real Bateman's murders are versus a complete breakdown of his psyche taking place instead.  However, this becomes one of the interesting points to debate after seeing this film and is not easily answered.  I'm keeping my eye peeled for the next film Christian Bale makes as he is an actor who could do marvelous work in the years ahead.</p></body></html>

The court room drama is bogus.  It doesn't matter if the real story took place in Germany, or "based on" in America -- legal procedure does not work as portrayed.  For example, the judge scolds the defense attorney in open court for being late.  That is grounds to request a mistrial (which would be denied) and later used as one of the issues on appeal.  The judge would have called both attorneys to the bench and quietly told them if either one was late they would be held in contempt of court.  By scolding the attorney in front of the jury -- which would not have been called in until both attorneys were present -- it sends a message to the jury that the judge is anti-defense attorney.<br /><br />More than likely some of the jurors were christian and maybe catholic.  (A good defense attorney would have made sure at least 4 of the jurors were catholic in an attempt to hang the jury.)  The D.A. does everything he can to insult the priest -- thereby insulting the jurors christian beliefs.  Even if the jurors don't believe in the priest's exorcism rites, they do believe in Christianity.  The D.A. has made himself unlikeable to the jury.  He shows the priest no respect and thereby the Christians of the jury no respect.<br /><br />(It is not uncommon for a jury to side with the attorney they like, regardless of the facts of the case.)<br /><br />A doctor who can help the defense approaches the defense attorney and says he will testify for the priest.  He is the key that will set the priest free.  What does the defense attorney tell him?  Come to court tomorrow morning!  The first thing she would have done is that night take his deposition in the presence of an attorney from the D.A.s office.  Then when he was killed, she could have entered that document into evidence.  A document does not carry the weight of live testimony with a jury, but it does with a Court of Appeals.  So, the doctor is accidentally killed and she has no great witness nor a document of his testimony.<br /><br />Half way into the trial, she discovers that she needs an M.D. who can rebut the states M.D.!  Excuse me, she would have deposed this M.D. prior to the trial -- she would have known exactly what his testimony was going to be.  Prior to the trial she would have lined up at least 3 M.D.s to rebut the states witness.  She would not wait to the last minute and have the light bulb go off in her head.<br /><br />And she tells her associate -- during the trial -- that she knows nothing about exorcisms. So the two of them get a stack of books to study -- and she's due back into court the next morning!  In other words, she did not prepare for the trial.  She works for a huge law firm.  This is a high-profile case.  Everyone in that firm would have contributed to making her defense.<br /><br />Out of desperation, she reads a book authored by an "expert" in exorcisms.  And what do you know -- the expert is available to testify.  But the expert can only testify as to what people of faith believe exorcisms to be, not if the priest performed a correct exorcism, or if an exorcism was even necessary.  And this is where the D.A. dropped the ball -- he could have (in a polite way) shredded this witness.  He only asked a couple of non-relevant questions.<br /><br />And finally, the defense attorney gives the worst closing argument in the history of jurisprudence.  Rent the film just to watch that closing argument.  She deliberately makes the case for the D.A.  She continually repeats all the strong points of his case, and underlines the weaknesses of her case.  She concludes by saying to effect, "Hey maybe there are demons -- I don't believe in them -- but the priest did, so you should give him the benefit of the doubt and set him free."<br /><br />The priest has grounds for appeal based upon his attorney giving up on his defense and surrendering to the D.A., and her lack of preparedness for trial.  He was definitely not represented by a competent attorney.  She should be disbarred.</p></body></html>

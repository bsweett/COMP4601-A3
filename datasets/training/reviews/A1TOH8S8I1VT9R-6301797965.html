So I make another list...<p>-If you've never seen this, it's not scary. Great spoof-humor throughout.<br />-If you don't like Mel Brooks stuff, try renting it. It is...<br />-Mel Brooks's best work.<br />-All of the performers absolutely nailed their roles. I had forgotten Gene Hackmans classic performance. Outstanding!!<br />-"Widescreen Review" gives the DVD 3.5 picture and 2.0 sound quality ratings.<br />-I would disagree. This is a Spoof of the classic "Frankensteins Monster". I believe this film was recorded in mono to mimic the feal of the original.<br />-The picture quality is actually quite clear.<br />-The extras are better-than-average for a DVD of this price.<br />-Included are deleted scenes and outakes. The "Parade of the Actors" is wonderfully zany!! Great stuff!!<br />-Great for Halloween when you would rather laugh than cringe.<br />-Not for young kids. They wouldn't get the jokes anyway.<p>I bought this as an afterthought. I was pleasantly surprized at what I got. If you're a Brooks fan... What are you waiting for? If not, rent it and see. I don't like averything he's done, but this one is a must have.</p></body></html>

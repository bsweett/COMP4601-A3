But as they say, curiosity killed the cat.. pun intended. At least it was just my friend's DVD, because if I had paid anything to see this, I would be really angry.<br /><br />I do not know what the heck was going on in the writing room when they came up with this or some of the plot points and details. When Catwoman saw the pictures of famous historical figures in the past, I was cheesed off to see a picture of Empress Dowager Cixi with cats, this is a historical inaccuracy as the Empress was a dog person. Please do not make up things about historical figures to 'add' to your 'movie'. Some of the other scenes, like the basketball one, were truly painful to watch.<br /><br />And the outfit - Good God, what the heck was that? Who came up with it? The 'Catwoman' costume worn by Michelle Pfeiffer in 'Batman Returns' was way better than this.</p></body></html>

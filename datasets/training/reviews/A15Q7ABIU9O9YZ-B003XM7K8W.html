<meta name="summary" content="Bob. How much did you get for the book?"></head><body><p>This is not the strongest of the Robert Crais books. Elvis Cole and Joe Pike are of course the two best known creations, the happy go lucky detective and his sullen, Vietnam traumatized partner. Crais has had some trouble breaking out of that mold (although 'Demolition Angel' was quite enjoyable). Hostage has the old premise, the gunfighter who loses his edge, the surgeon who loses a child on the operating table, the race car driver  . . . . Well. You get the picture.<br /><br />So Talley loses one in LA and ends up in some Godforsaken place. Where, of course, he faces another hostage crisis (actually two.)<br /><br />You know somebody wrote that from the credits they knew this motion picture was going to be junk. Amen, brother. Me too. I knew from the credits I was being held hostage. What a load of junk, over acting, over grinning, over leering, over the top. Far over.<br /><br />Sorry. 2 stars because I like Willis and I'm a big fan of Crais but, Robert, when you sell your book you have to make a deal where you maintain some creative control. Otherwise, they make your book look stupid and YOU lose fans. They did the same thing to John Katzenbach's "Hart's War." Hey. Wait a second. That was Bruce Willis, too.

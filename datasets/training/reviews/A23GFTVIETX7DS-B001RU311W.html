<meta name="summary" content="An eye-opening account of the early Gay Rights Movement"></head><body><p>Watching "Milk," with its historical footage mixed with acted scenes, made me realize just how far we've come since the 1970s and 1980s regarding gay rights and tolerance.  Director Gus Van Sant and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black provide this context through their telling of the life of Harvey Milk, a gay man who moved to the Castro in San Francisco during the time when its gay population was first exploding.  Even viewers not familiar with Milk's story will know within the first few minutes that Milk will be killed; however, the suspense in this film is not how that will happen, but how Milk will manage to transcend it through his decade of activism.<br /><br />Sean Penn plays Milk so convincingly and lovingly that it's easy to forget that the role is acted.  Penn's Milk is never stereotyped and instead comes across as a passionate, courageous man who has decided that he has no choice but to fight.  Other standout performances include James Franco as Scott, Milk's true love; Diego Luna (Y Tu Mama Tambien) as wacko, flamboyant, needy Jack;  Josh Brolin as repressed and lonely Dan White;  Emile Hirsch, as Cleve Jones; and Alison Pill, as Anne Kronenberg.  Anita Bryant, in news clips that seem laughable today, comes across as a dangerous force of her time.<br /><br />Although both gays and lesbians continue to face obstacles on a daily basis, this film drives home just how difficult it was in the years following the otherwise liberating sixties and seventies.  The characters in "Milk" yearn to be treated like equal members of society, and their actors imbibe them with such humanity that I would be surprised if their performances don't open a few eyes.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p></body></html>

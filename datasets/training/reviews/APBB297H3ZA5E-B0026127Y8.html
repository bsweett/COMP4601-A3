I was mildly disappointed by the time this movie finished, not because it was bad, but my expectations were higher than the reality.<br /><br />2.  Overall, a good / solid action movie, good acting, good story etc... however nothing beyond that which would move it into the exceptional category.  ie, definitely rent the DVD, but it doesn't merit purchasing it for one's collection.</p></body></html>

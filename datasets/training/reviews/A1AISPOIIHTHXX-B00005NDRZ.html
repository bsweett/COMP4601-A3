<meta name="summary" content="It's more unsettling than scary"></head><body><p>I'll put this in perspective: the only other Kubrick film I've seen is Clockwork Orange which I didn't like all that much. So I guess in a way it's perfect for people inquiring about this film since I'm not a "anything director touches is gold" idea. I've never seen Dr Strangelove or 2001 so I'm merely reviewing this as a movie fan and not a Kubrick one, even though the film is quite good.<br /><br />Jack Torrance is a teacher/struggling writer and a job as an off-season caretaker is just the trip he needs to clear his head. Off to the Overlook Hotel with his wife and son, he takes up residence in there only to find that they're not exactly the only occupants in the place. And Jack starts to find himself changing by the day.<br /><br />Earlier I posted a review for the Exorcist, another well-made horror film and another thing felt familiar: the parody of the scenes. Maybe because they're parodied and lose their shock then many of the images in this film weren't scary but more unsettling. But still, love those parodies(All beer and no TV make Homer something something).  The images however are memorable: the twin girls, the blood getting off the elevator and a guy in a bear suit, qualifying for the biggest "what the hell?" moment in film.<br /><br />One thing that did irritate me about the film was the music: it was a bit too overbearing. It's almost as if the music was going "be scared, hurry up and be scared already!". Music in essence shouldn't do that, it should supply it without you being conciously aware of it. While it does its job of being very unnerving and being "scary movie" music, it felt a bit too loud at parts. Another thing the film had which you I can understand is a large amount of tracking steadicam shots. There's probably at least 15 or so in the entire film.<br /><br />With good performances, memorable scenes and good tracking shots(although really used excessively), it's not the most scariest film ever, it's just a really well-done thriller movie.</p></body></html>

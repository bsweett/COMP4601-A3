<meta name="summary" content="Everyone Will Hear You Scream..."></head><body><p>"Alien" is Ridley Scott&#8217;s masterful &#8220;haunted house in outer space&#8221; movie, the one where tall and incredibly gorgeous Sigourney Weaver meets the relentless space monsters for the first time....<br /><p>Yes, this is a scary movie, but another word for it would be &#8220;funky.&#8221; From the lived-in look of the Nostromo (the space tug Weaver&#8217;s first mate on) to the grubby jumpsuits and tennis shoes the crew wears, this movie has a very grungy ambience. Add H.R. Giger&#8217;s insane insect creatures and exploding eggs, and you&#8217;ve got the birth of a franchise- and source material for an infinite series of rip-offs set everywhere from outer space to under the sea. When this came out (1979), it looked like nothing else. Now, you&#8217;ll notice how it looks like EVERYTHING else, which just goes to show you the genius involved here.<br /><p>It's far more than just a stylistic exercise, though; this movie&#8217;s got quirky characters galore. Weaver&#8217;s the tough, no-nonsense lieutenant, Tom Skerrit is the not-so forceful captain, Yaphett Kotto and Harry Dean Stanton are the ultra-working class stiffs of a blue collar bunch, and Veronica Cartwright is sort of shrill, but compassionate. Brits John Hurt and Ian Holm round out the crew: Hurt is the poor schlep who gets impregnated by the nastiest crab outside bad seafood buffet and Holm is the creepy, milk-drinking science officer with a secret agenda.<br /><p> "Alien" has a simple plot, with scares of every kind... mounting tension, the old jump-at-the camera trick, the false-sense-of-security ending and more.  The DVD features a wide-screen, crisp print and incredible sound, plus a snazzy animated menu based on the "Mother" computer from the film. It gives the whole experience an immersive quality.

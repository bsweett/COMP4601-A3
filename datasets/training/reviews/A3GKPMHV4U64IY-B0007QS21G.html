<meta name="summary" content="Beware the Superstorm"></head><body><p>I have to say that this film really reminded me of Armageddon.  Not in story or plot, but in the way that the movie can be so enjoyable and make little sense when it comes to science and common sense.  The movie is loosely based on the book THE COMING OF THE GLOBAL SUPERSTORM and concerns massive climate changes and how they affect life as we know it.<br /><br />The movie begins on an ice shelf where a climatologist is taking core samples.  These samples combined with events on the shelf drive the scientist (Quaid) to hypothesize that a new ice age is in the near future unless we change our ways now.  To keep things movie, Quad is wrong on the time frame and things begin happening very quickly and drastically.  Like ID4, we follow a number of groups as they are affected by the events, especially Quaid and his almost estranged family.<br /><br />Typical of this type of film, politics and politicians are painted as bad guys although some do come to their senses.  The action never lets up and the special effects are absolutely stunning.  There are a couple of deleted scenes on the disk that really help link a number of events better than they were in the final product, but the movie worked well without them.<br /><br />If you are a fan of disaster films then this is one of the biggest you could see.  Check it out.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Review dedicated to the people of Japan a day after their 8.9 magnitude earthquake and tsunami."></head><body><p>I viewed this movie on Thursday, normally right after watching a movie I would rush to write a review while everything is still fresh in my mind. However, this was not to be the case. But yesterday, after seeing the vast and total devastation of the tsunami in Japan, I decided to now write it, in memory of all those who perished in this disaster.<br /><br />A very realistic Tsunami<br /><br />This movie opens in India 2004, with a very realistic tsunami sequence. This is a very frightful situation to be caught up in. Those living in low lying coastal earthquake prone areas must now consider the very real possibility of a tsunami coming to shore and changing their lives forever.<br /><br />A Necromancer<br /><br />In this film, Matt Damon takes on the role of George Lonegan. It is explained that because of a near death operation that he now has the ability to communicate with the dead. While this appears to be a plausible explanation, it should be noted that this is only fiction. According to Christian beliefs, the souls of the dead do not just drift about waiting to talk to their relatives through `mediums'.<br /><br />The Plot<br /><br />The plot starts out on three fronts:<br /><br />[1] - a French reporter who turns writer, her life is changed by a tsunami;<br />[2] - 2 brothers (twins) one is killed and the other desperately misses him; and<br />[3] - a necromancer who is trying desperately to live a normal life.<br /><br />In the end, the lines are all neatly tied up. Overall this is an interesting picture, but remember, it is only fiction, so don't go out there trying to hear from your deceased loved ones.</p></body></html>

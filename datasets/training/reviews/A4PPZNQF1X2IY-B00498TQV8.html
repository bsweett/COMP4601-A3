<meta name="summary" content="Hillbilly realism"></head><body><p>You've got to like the gritty, red-neck bumpkin dialogue in this movie, and the dirt poor landscapes of rusted-out cars and junk spewed across the yards.  Haven't seen a movie like this.  Great little heroine and redemptive outcome, paying the price for justice according to a hillbilly code.  Drug use and one semi-gorey scene.  Effective movie on its own terms.</p></body></html>

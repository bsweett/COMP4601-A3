The title refers to the deadly sins which collectively inspire some horrible serial killer to perpetrate particularly gory murders (one man is overfed to death, another is kept in bed with his limbs and tongue removed, still another is forced to perform an act of unspeakable sexual violation). There isn't much of a story here, mostly because director David Fincher spends most of his time on the visuals - the setting is some barely identifiable city where the weather is perpetually horrible (it's always raining, like in Blade Runner), and everybody looks like they deserve some kind of divine retribution. Unfortunately, the visuals not only take attention from the story, they make it almost impossible to understand what the story really is. (Just like in Fincher's "Alien3", only that film did sustain a fair amount of suspense for the first half hour). The characters aren't well developed - with Freeman playing his worldly wise self, Pitt as the young hotwire slated to replace him, and Kevin Spacey as the object of their hunt. Besides the stars, everybody else seems to exist in some form only slightly more substantial than the fog that engulfs the city. When the killer turns himself in (you didn't think a script this thin allowed for some real detective work, did you?) the lack of character definition is clear. Who is the killer and how has his hunt been brought to end - are questions that you not only can't answer after finishing this movie, but you are sapped for any reason to even care. The film ends on a major cop out. I can't believe somebody thought that the cooler thrills of "Silence of the Lambs" were any way touched by this film.</p></body></html>

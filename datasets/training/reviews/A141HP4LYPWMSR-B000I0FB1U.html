His main duty is to provide the daily meals for his fellow monks and the orphans they care for. Beyond his missionary obligations Nacho dreams of being a great wrestler one day. He has already decided that Nacho Libre will be his ring name as he wiles away his spare time designing his mask and costume. When Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Requera) arrives at the monastery Nacho becomes even more determined to realize his dream and impress the beautiful nun.<br /><br />There's nothing challenging here, just a silly, lighthearted film good for a laugh or two. If you're a Jack Black fan you'll love it. Not quite worth  -4 Stars- but a solid 3 1/2.</p></body></html>

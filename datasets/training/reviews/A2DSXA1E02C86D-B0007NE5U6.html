<meta name="summary" content="A walking disaster muddles through"></head><body><p>I never had a sister, but Bridget Jones would be the one I wish I had even if only for the entertainment value.<br /><br />In BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON, our heroine (Renee Zellweger) is an on-air personality for a British telly that specializes in pseudo-journalism. In the first sequence of scenes, Bridget reports live as she parachutes from a plane into a pigpen's excremental bog. Consistent with this, her life is pretty much of a total disaster except for an ongoing affair with a high-powered amnesty lawyer, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), about whom she dreamily counts the days, hours and minutes of their relationship as well as the number of times they've &#34;shagged&#34;. The wildcards are Rebecca (Jacinda Barrett), Darcy's assistant, both elegant and gorgeous - attributes not to be associated with Jones - with whom Mark may also be dallying, and Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), an old boyfriend who still lusts after what's inside Bridget's &#34;giant panties&#34;.<br /><br />Bridget's engaging persona is established in BRIDGET JONES DIARY (2001). Though the original was perhaps a better film, neither it (nor this one) are the comedic fluff of which indelible cinematic memories are made. Therefore, by default and my failing memory, THE EDGE OF REASON must stand on its own merits. (Perhaps the two are best seen together when they're eventually released as a DVD set.) In any case, I've always had an objection to any appearance by Colin Firth, which always results in an on-screen character, in my opinion, totally devoid of charm or humor. Perhaps he reminds me to much of myself:&#62;) (Only in a 1996 film adaptation of Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE did this formula work for me.) Hugh Grant, here a charming rascal that could well be my alter ego, has only a subordinate role. Too bad.<br /><br />Bridget certainly has pluck, best depicted when, after being arrested in Bangkok for drug smuggling, she becomes the song coach and darling of a jail cell-full of Thai prostitutes . Ok, ok, that subplot was a bit of a stretch by the screenwriters, but it works for her. My biggest problem with Jones is that I can't see her in a romantic (or even prurient light), so her triangular relationship with Darcy and Cleaver remains, for me, unconvincing. It's a chemistry thing.<br /><br />I hope Zellwegger, at the risk of being typecast, consents to do another episode in the series. Despite my reservations and chemical imbalance, they're good fun.</p></body></html>

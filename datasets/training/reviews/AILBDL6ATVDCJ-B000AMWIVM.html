But the script was too generic.  A little research was needed.  Let me explain:<br /><br />#1. A doctor would never say he had been electrocuted because he knows what the word means!  It means you are dead.  The average person does say that when they are shocked; doctors NEVER do, ever.<br /><br />#2. Why would the good doctor use the saw (removing...well, I don't want to give anything away)when he could have used his shirt to reach the cell phone on the floor?<br /><br />#3.  The twist of the movie is not really a twist at all.  I don't want to give away the plot, but it doesn't hold up as being a "Wow, I never would have guessed that?" movie - if that is really what the author was shooting for.  The viewer was not given enough information to make the shock value come out.<br /><br />#4.  The detectives would have discussed the "other" evidence in the case: hundreds of feet of razor-wire, timing devices, the safe, the candles, etc.  Why did none of this material lead them to a purchase location?  This needed to be explained, because there has never been a killer, in the history of killers, who has left so much material behind.  He had to buy or steal this stuff from some place.  And some of the material was so unique, like the contraption he strapped to the one woman's head, that they would have to be able to trace the origins.<br /><br />#5  I was sickened by another film where a person who has just been terrorized by an EVIL person doesn't pull the trigger when the tables turn.  I've seen thirty years of that ridiculous scenario.  When will Hollywood learn how dumb that is.  I would have shot the guy in the forehead until his brains became artwork on the carpet.<br /><br />Okay, all that said, the movie did have some good acting and some really creepy scenes.  It is disgustingly horrific and a little interesting.  The film could have been so much more with a little more thought and research put into the script.  Ya can't blame this one on the acting.<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Best of the Original Batman Movie Series"></head><body><p>In this Batman film he's taken seriously and you don't get shots of his butt in the Bat costume. Joel Schumacher was obsessed with shots of Batman's butt for some reason lol. The movie is perfectly dark and sometimes comical. It doesn't over-due the campiness like Batman Forever and Batman & Robin.<br /><br />  While the under-rated Michael Keaton gives us a fine Bruce Wayne that's still haunted by the death of his parents. It's also brilliant how their murder is linked to the Joker. The "You Made Me and I made You" stuff between the Joker and Batman is well done.<br /><br />  When you think about it though the script is still thin though. I mean yes the Joker is perfectly evil here but what's his real game plan ? It works that he's really not as happy as his difigurement makes him look. So he wants to disfigure other people as well. But other than that his obsession with Vicky Vale doesn't work that well. What does he want from her ? Disfigure her like he did his ex-girlfriend ? Or just dance with her on the top floor of an abandoned church ? lol.<br /><br />  I always had such a ball watching this movie that I never thought of such things. Jack Nicholson is so good as the Joker that I never thought about how the movie doesn't have a solid plot. He did just play a Jack yet again though even if he looked good in the role and had a great Joker laugh. Heath Ledger did more with the role since he transformed into someone else entirely. You also didn't simply have him fall in chemicals. We don't even know what made him the way he is. He tells 2 stories with both of them different and both of them probably aren't even true. Which is even more ingenious than how Jack became the Joker here.<br /><br />  I do still think that Roger Ebert's review was unfair though. He even picked on it saying that Keaton and Basinger have no chemestry. I think they work fine together but in a Batman film who cares about their romance ? The film still delivers and what really mattered is that Keaton and Nicholson played off of each other great. Besides, Batman Begins may be a good movie but Batman just giving a kid part of his costume bugged me as much as Alfred letting Vicky Vale into the Batcave. Yet, that didn't bug Ebert.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Disaster at Sea Gets an Upgrade"></head><body><p>It all started with Paul Gallico's novel, "The Poseidon Adventure," which I found fascinating due to the way it presented a fairy tale disguised as a modern survival story. I say this mostly because of character development; each person was assigned a given personality that never faltered and often times created great conflict as they made their way through the bowels of the capsized S.S. Poseidon, a luxurious but aging ocean liner. Despite most being unwilling to band together, they were still drawn to the leadership of an obsessively driven reverend, and in an almost supernatural way, they continued on their journey.<br /><br />Then came Irwin Allen's 1972 film adaptation, something that focused more on the action than on the humanity of the situation. I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of this version; I guess I was too bogged down by the original novel and the way it banded a group of one-tracked characters together. It did succeed in providing some good visual material (even though the special effects are cheesy looking by today's standards), and it gave audiences a lot of familiar faces to root for (Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelly Winters, Red Buttons, and Jack Albertson just to name a few). But on the whole it felt flat, emotionless, and shallow.<br /><br />Now we have Wolfgang Petersen's remake, simply entitled "Poseidon." Petersen--perfectly capable of handling nautical tragedies ("The Perfect Storm")--has crafted a much more entertaining adaptation despite the fact that character development is seriously lacking (meaning that it bears little if any resemblance to Gallico's novel, other than the capsized ship). There's really no need to describe the basic plot; anyone who's read the book or seen the original film will know what to expect. And even if they haven't done either, the trailer for this new version pretty much says it all: on New Year's Eve, a freak title wave hits the ship and flips it over, leaving precious little time for a handful of survivors to work their way to the keel and escape.<br /><br />The aspects of the story created just for this version focus only on special effects and character names. Gone are the Reverend Frank Scott, Mike and Linda Rogo, Manny and Belle Rosen, Susan and Robin Shelby, and James Martin. Instead, we have: Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas), a former navy officer; Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), a retired firefighter and former Mayor of New York; his daughter, Jennifer (Emmy Rossum), secretly engaged to the love of her life, Christian (Mike Vogel); Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfus), an architect reeling over the breakup with his boyfriend; Maggie James (Jacinda Barrett) and her son, Conor (Jimmy Bennett); and Elena Gonzales (Mia Maestro), a stowaway desperate to reach New York and visit her hospitalized brother.<br /><br />In terms of the special effects, I think it's obvious that the model-ship-in-a-tub quality shots of the original film don't hold a candle to the work put into this remake. The destruction scenes are absolutely amazing, and for that we can thank computer generated imagery. The overall design of the Poseidon itself is striking, looking more like a streamlined, modern luxury liner than a cheap imitation of the Queen Mary. It's the kind of look that lends itself better to the moments of action, which are numerous to say the least; certain sections of the ship can't seem to stop flooding, and there are enough explosions to keep thrill junkies on the edge of their seats. It takes the action to a level the original film didn't dare explore by making it fast paced and adrenaline pumping.<br /><br />Of course, I can't forget that because this takes place in the present day, the technology is much more advanced. Is this an improvement? Not necessarily, although it does make the danger they're in more realistic (because, as we all know, technology doesn't always ensure survival). In both the novel and the original film, the characters made the perilous journey with only the hope that they might be rescued. But in reality, they had no way of knowing if they had any chance of survival. In today's world, there are GPS satellite tracking systems and automatic distress signals. In "Poseidon," help is definitely on the way for these people. It's just a matter of time. It's also a matter of who makes it and who doesn't (and you probably already know that not everyone does).<br /><br />In this sense, it's almost symbolic that the characters are forced to encounter death on their journey (just as it's symbolic that the ship is named after the destructive ancient Greek god of the sea). They frequently pass dozens of dead bodies that are strewn throughout the wreckage, signaling a kind of cinematic foreshadowing. This aspect of the story was prominent in the novel but barely alluded to in the original film; in that version, the dead are shown sparingly, making it seem like the characters were traveling through a deserted ghost ship. It wasn't plausible because an ocean liner holds thousands of people during a voyage, not just in passenger friendly areas, but in the lower decks, as well. The remake did a better job of showing that the people are trying to escape from a tomb as well as from a sinking ship.<br /><br />It's interesting that I found "Poseidon" so much more enjoyable than "The Poseidon Adventure," considering the humanity of Gallico's story still hasn't been explored. Maybe I went into the remake knowing that his Disaster at Sea fable wouldn't be taken into serious consideration; it's an upgrade of the original film, not the novel. That must have enabled me to turn off my feelings for it and focus only on the new material. Everyone always says an original is better than a remake, but apparently, that isn't always the case. I will say that "Poseidon" isn't better than the novel; that was far too unique to be overshadowed by a film adaptation. But as a film and as a remake, it works.<br /><br />Take whatever you will from this upgraded movie. It delivers exactly what it promises in a relatively short period of time, and it definitely isn't boring. I'd recommend it, even to the diehard fans of Irwin Allen's 1972 film. Maybe it's time they get upgraded, as well.</p></body></html>

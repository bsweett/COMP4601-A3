I guess it's meant to be sipped like a fine wine, by people who have lots and lots of time to lounge around watching movies. Like movie critics, who hailed it like it was kung pao shrimp done right (without the green peppers).<br /><br />Calling this movie a comedy is like calling Shaun of the Dead a "romantic comedy with zombies." Sort of. It's more like "a mostly depressing movie with funny bits."<br /><br />Paul Giamatti and his sidekick conjure up two lifelike characters here, one a schoolteacher aspiring to be a writer, the other a second-string actor (with the attendant dumbness, affording us many great/funny moments). You know the basic story, so I'll skip it.<br /><br />I wanted to quit it but also wanted to see what happened. It's funny, it's sad, it's interesting, it's hopeful, and ... it flows along at a pace that apparently enthralls certain circles, for reasons I don't understand (well, maybe I do). But I'm just your average unsophisticated moviegoer.</p></body></html>

The story of three childhood pals who suffer symbiotic personal traumas both as children and later as adults recalls classic noirs like "Out Of The Past" and "The Strange Love of Martha Ivers". Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Hardin and Laura Linney inject the film with much more life than the workmanlike script deserves, and these fine actors are well worth spending the time with. We have become accustomed to Eastwood the director's character-driven, leisurely-paced and deliberate way of making films; with certain efforts it has worked beautifully ("Unforgiven" and "Bird" come to mind)-but this time out, Clint should have pulled in the reins a bit tighter. What you end up with is an extended episode of TV's "Homicide"; basically a standard police procedural with better-than-average acting. Worth a look on cable or as a rental, but it would be tough going to sit through this one more than once.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="closer to but not quite 2 stars"></head><body><p>being that this is the age of CGI's,i cant say that great effects alone will salvage a bad movie.yes there are exceptions(league of extraordinary gentlemen,van helsing,troy,hulk...)but for the most part,they had better be some kick butt CGI's.i,robot's CGIs werent that good.the fresh prince was once again being the fresh prince(CAN SOMEONE PLEASE GIVE THIS GUY ANOTHER PERSONALITY?!?!?!?!?!?)in each of his movies,im expecting to see a butler pop up and give him some advice.this is the godawfull independence day all over again.a very good idea ruined by a 1 trick pony!!!!!!!!!!!!of course his freshness isnt entirely to blame.the script was abysmal.the charactors....were there any?!?!?!?the ''humor'' straight out of snaps 1982 edition.the only thing missing was the canned laugh track.people must really have to dumb themselves up in order to watch and enjoy movies nowadays.(FOR THOSE NEEDING TO LEAVE THEIR BRAINS OUT OF WATCHING A MOVIE.....YOU HAVE A FUTURE IN POLITICS!).the jist of this junk is as follows....robots are our friend.they are the new video game.bound by THE 3 LAWS robots are slaves that dont mind being slaves.but spooner(the fresh prince)is a cop who has a ''gut feeling''about these robots.and of course his feelings are mocked at first.his hatred of all things C3PO'esque is due to the fact that a robot decided to rescue him instead of a little girl(aaawwwwwww,how touching)during a car wreck that sent both cars into the drink.youd think,judging by the level of hatred,that one of the robots ran off with his wife.he hates them because they saved him...PITIFULL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!his suspicions are fed when his''mentor?''takes a walk out of his office window.this is also when the CGIs kick in.theyre nice to look at but makes the movie even more ridiculous.and ms calvin...you really improved on your shooting abilities!first you were shooting robots with your eyes closed all scared,and now that you have 100's leaping at you,you become the next rambo!!!!im impressed!!!!thers way too much wrong with this for me to really put into words.all i know is that im not completely upset renting this(i have a deal where you rent 2 get 1 free....guess which was my freebie).to spend more than the cost of a rental really would be self insulting.my gut feeling is that those buying this mess and giving it rating above 2 are women who cant wait to hit the pause button when willy strikes a pose in his 2035 style bathroom.pitifull</p></body></html>

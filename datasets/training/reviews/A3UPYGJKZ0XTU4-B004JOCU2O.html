<meta name="summary" content="A Runaway Train. A Race Against Time. Old-Fashioned, Edge-of-Seat Action."></head><body><p>"Unstoppable" is a heart-pounding action flick that reminds me a lot of 1999's superb "Speed", with its cast of ordinary citizens and an ordinary vehicle hurtling toward destruction. At Fuller Yard in Northern Pennsylvania, the 39-car train 777 gets away from its operator when he abandons the cabin to fix a switch. Meanwhile, at Brewster Yard in Southern Pennsylvania, veteran engineer Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington) and novice conductor Will Colson (Chris Pine) don't quite hit it off. They're heading toward Stanton in train 1206. When it is discovered that 777 is not coasting but is under power and picking up speed, carrying a load of molten phenol and diesel fuel, the Fuller yardmaster Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson) clashes with her company's VP Oscar Gavin (Kevin Dunn) on how to cope with the crisis.<br /><br />The day begins slowly, as people go about their jobs on the railroad. It takes everyone a while to grasp the extent of the problem. The audience gets to know them. The film's title sequence claims it was "inspired by true events", a reference to a 2001 train mishap in Ohio involving a runaway train carrying molten phenol. It wasn't nearly so hair-raising in real life, but the element of near-plausibility makes "Unstoppable" more compelling. It's a race against time, not against high-tech gadgetry. The train must be stopped before it reaches a curve in Stanton, which will cause it to derail and spew toxic chemicals. The technology that can be brought to bear on the problem is limited. It's a railroad. So this is an old-fashioned action movie, punched up with some doom and gloom and the occasional explosion, but thoroughly enjoyable.</p></body></html>

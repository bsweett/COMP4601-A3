Don't get me wrong, this film is very funny at times and Mike Myers did an excellent job, but the addition of Beyonce Knowles and the gratuitous cameos made me think, &quot;Why are they doing that?&quot; <p>I still think that people should check out this film and judge it for themselves. It has it's moments where you're doubled over with laughter, but unfortunately those moments aren't as often as they have been in the past.</p></body></html>

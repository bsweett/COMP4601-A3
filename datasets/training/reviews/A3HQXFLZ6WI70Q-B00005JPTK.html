<meta name="summary" content="Very cool movie. Very nice bluray"></head><body><p>Verdict:<br />Movie is really nice (simple story but cool). I prefer the alternate ending (much more realistic; I hate happy endings). CGI of the monster is too "smooth" but still believable enough. This is the movie where I realized Will Smith can actually act (the same way I realized Ashton Kutcher can act after watching Butterfly Effect; which I also own).<br />Bluray: Very nice video and audio.</p></body></html>

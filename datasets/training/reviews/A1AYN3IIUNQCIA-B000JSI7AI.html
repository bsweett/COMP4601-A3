<meta name="summary" content="th best film of the year"></head><body><p>i have to agree, Brokeback got robbed at the oscars. this is definently one of the biggest upsets like when Shakespear in Love won over the excpected Saving Private Ryan. why the film lost i can speculate is because of prejudice, theme, and all the late night jokes about it (have you seen comedy central when it came out?) i guess the academy wasent ready for a film adressing the gay theme to take home the most prestigous film award but we can look at the bright side, in a year or two we will forget about the Crash victory but Brokeback will only gain in popularity and it will become a classic like other robbed oscar films. the film has a sad tone in it and when it shows pictures of happiness its just heartbreaking. the film is about two ranchers, Ennis and Jack, who meet one summer tending sheep in the wilderness of Brokeback Mountain and by fate, fall in love. then as time goes buy they get married, have kids, but still always meet at the mountain to rekindle there love. all the performences are great, Gyllenhaal gives his best performence since the Good Girl while Hathaway comes far since her Princess diaries days. but the two standout performces are Ledger and Williams. Ledger perfectly brings a gruff, quiet Ennis to the screen with explosive results and Williams has blossomed into a pitch perfect actress potraying Ennis's tortured wife and proves she has come a long way since Dawson's creek. i have loved Ang Lee's films from Sense and Sensibilty to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but this by far is his best film to date, i wont give away the ending but i will say the shirt...just makes you want to cry. some people may shy away from the film but its a great film so i definently recomend seeing it. it is truley the best film of the year.</p></body></html>

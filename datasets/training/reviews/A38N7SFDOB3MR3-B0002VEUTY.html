<meta name="summary" content="Sci-Fi Heaven. 84 out of 100."></head><body><p>The Chronicles of Riddick is sci-fi heaven. This movie has it all. An awesome anti hero/hero. Evil villians that are unique/half deads, trying to conquer planets for a dark, dark side. Brutal fight scenes. Plenty of goodies for the space addict including great ship/world designs, unique planets, etc.<br /><br />On my list of best sci-fi of all time, this flick is in the top ten. It is the complete package, and brings a much needed darker space opera world to the big screen.<br /><br />Call the Chronicles of Riddick the anti-Star Wars, if you will. I mean that as a compliment. I love Star Wars, but this is definately the anti-hero version. The Chronicles of Riddick is gritty, dark and intense. There are no "beww, beww" laser beams here. Nope. The good and bad guns fire hefty guns, and carry knives and axes. Here's hoping that 2-3 more Riddick films make their way to the screen.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 84<br /><br />43 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br />6 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br />8 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?<br />8 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?<br />10 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?<br />9 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?</p></body></html>

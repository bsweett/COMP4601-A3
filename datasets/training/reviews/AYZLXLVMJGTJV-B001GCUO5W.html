The island has a supernatural feel to it, that gives off a creepy vibe. The staff are very odd when it comes time to answer questions. The missing girl is a criminal patient in a prison mental health facility. The explanation on how the girl went missing was again unexplainable and mysterious. Leo who is the key character and lead officer feels frustrated because he is not getting answers and is starting to pitch out signs of anxiety. He is thinking he will write up his reports and leave due to the staff and head adminstrator's lack of cooperation. He has eerie flashbacks before leaving which prompt him to stay and give us a clue to his character. He is holding onto a painful memory that haunts him. This memory is also including dreamlike episodes with his deceased wife, who helps him to gain access to solving particular problems or guiding him in his life journey. Her image is also suspense building and dark. The story leads to the runaway being found. She is living in a world of her own and cannot grasp the reality of her circumstances. She has killed her children and been on the island to serve out her time while being treated. She meets up with Leo's character and sees him as her dead husband. Until she shifts abruptly and realizes he is not what she thought. Here the story starts to become quite interesting. It is hard to go into and there are a few twists which are quite arresting and thought provoking. The plot takes on a whole new avenue of development. Is Leo actually a patient who is suffering from a delusion. A delusion is a fixed fact that cannot be broken or is he being turned into this because he has stumbled onto some possible damning evidence that could hurt others. This is where I think the viewer has to decide. It could be easy and he could just be a patient not wanting to face his actions and living out his delusion or he really could have been erased, meaning his identity taken from him by mind control and drugs. I won't go further with this. What I took away from this film was an uneasy feeling of coincidence, won't go into why. I liked the isolation of an island and the rocky cliffs with the crashing waves. I guess it gave off a remote piercing kind of feel, wild and beautiful. The isolation fed into the eerie hospital and adminstrator's personality. The apparation of the woman doctor,or was it, seemed intriguing again lending a question. Do you believe it? Could something like this be done? Absolutely. Would one want to be in a mental hospital like this. Was it pretending to be caring and concerned about unlocking the psyche from its unending hell or was it experimenting on people for the benefit of science or something else. These are again thoughts, questions. The atmosphere feels secretive and guarded so that suggests a possible dysfunction. The staff could have been looked at thru the eyes of a delusional patient so its all uncertain. There are parts that i would have liked to have viewed again but did not. Memories being taken? Feelings being medicated.</p></body></html>

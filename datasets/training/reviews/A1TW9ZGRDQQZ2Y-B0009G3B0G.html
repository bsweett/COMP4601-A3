<meta name="summary" content="A Very Interesting Little Film Indeed"></head><body><p>I just got back from seeing "The Jacket" and I was impressed with what I saw. The acting is very solid from Adrien Brody and Keira Knightley (yes guys...she does show some skin). Hopefully that statement alone will get some more people to see this film, because it won't stay in theaters too long. It moves at a slow yet interesting pace and for a film based on time-travel & insanity it makes a lot of sense when it's over. I like when films end leaving it up to your own interpretation and that is the case with this one. An impressive directing debut from John Maybury and it has earned a strong 4 out of 5 stars in my book.</p></body></html>

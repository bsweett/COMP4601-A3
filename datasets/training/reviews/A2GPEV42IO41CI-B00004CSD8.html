<meta name="summary" content="Bad Omen"></head><body><p>When the son of Deputy Ambassador Thorn (Liev Schreiber) dies at birth in an Italian hospital, a helpful priest convinces him to take another baby and not tell his wife Kate (Julia Stiles) about the switch.  Five years later, Thorn is US Ambassador to England, Kate still hasn't bonded with little Damien, and people start dying all around the family.<br /><br />If I hadn't seen the 1976 "Omen," I probably would have found this version OK, but I am a fan of the original and this one pales in comparison.  With the exception David Thewlis, who gives a good performance as the photographer, all of the actors come up short, mostly because they were miscast.  Stiles is too young and model-pretty to be believable; her face bore no signs of anguish or fear.  Schrieber looks the part, but no one could match Gregory Peck for style, subtlety, and maturity.  The child who plays Damien looks evil throughout the movie; his  exaggerated scowls are tiring.  Mia Farrow as the nanny is too pretty and cheerful; she needed Billie Whitelaw's chilling gothic presence.<br /><br />Both versions have the same plot, but this one seemed tedious and overlong; the only spookiness comes from sudden, loud noises.  The first "Omen" had a memorable musical score that caused goosebumps all by itself; this time around the music is loud and overwhelming, but not scary.  The location photography and big-budget production values are nice, but all in all, 2006's "Omen" is forgettable.</p></body></html>

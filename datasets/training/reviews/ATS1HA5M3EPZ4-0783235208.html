The Mummy is definitely a throwback to the old horror movies of the 40s and 50s.  Thankfully updated with excellent special effects as well as humor and fast paced action.  It's an adventure movie, nothing more.  Brendan Fraser is a blast to watch as dual pistol packing, attitude slapping, down to earth ex-Legionnaire who finds himself teaming up with a couple of geeky librarian siblings, one of which happens to be the beautiful Rachael Weisz.  Fraser's character is hired by the two because he has seen something no one else has, the grave site of the lost city of Hamunaptra that holds the tomb of Imhotep, a powerful high priest in the days of the greatest and richest Pharaoh.  What follows is a semi complex adventure that keeps you hanging and keeps you entertained.  There are definitely some creepy moments and some aspects are intriguing, specifically the burials and rituals of the ancient Egyptians.  Some aspects are of course, stretched and unrealistic, but you can't expect Oscar material from some thing like this, who in their right mind would?  But The Mummy is a great piece of movie work and the DVD is full of extra features, so it is well worth buying.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Floundering remake"></head><body><p>From director turned producer Michael Bay, who produced New Line Cinema's 2003 remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, comes this floundering remake of 1979's Amityville Horror.  Wasting no time in getting to the shocks and disregarding any logic whatsoever, the film shows George (Ryan Reynolds) and Kathy Lutz (Melissa George), along with Kathy's three children from her recently deceased ex-husband, move into an infamous house where grisly murders occured not even a year before.  After that, the viewer is slammed with quick edits, distorted faces, demonic voices, and disorienting camera angles, with no pity given to Ryan Reynolds' character at all as he wastes no time going insane and hunting down his family.  While many won't agree, this remake is actually better than the original, but then again the original wasn't that good to begin with.  Based on the supposed true story, the Amityville Horror is worth a look for horror buffs, and with all the PG-13 rated horror movies to be released as of late it's nice to see a new horror film with some blood and gore, but don't expect anything special out of it at all.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Really Fun Movie! Highly Recommended"></head><body><p>"Iron Man" is a really fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Casting Robert Downey Jr as the very personality flawed billionaire military weapons manufacturer Tony Stark was just perfect.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me, the movie follows the transformation of Tony Stark from selfish (not sure he actually changes much there) playboy to a full fledged Marvel Superhero (but as Pepper says, "You are NOT a superhero").<br /><br />Obviously this type of movie requires some suspension of disbelief, but the humor, action, and special effects keep the little issues way in the back of your mind.<br /><br />A very enjoyable movie, Highly Recommended!</p></body></html>

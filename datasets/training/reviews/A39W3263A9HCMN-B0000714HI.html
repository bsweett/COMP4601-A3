Yet I din't understand it as much as i understood he first 2, but then again, I enjoyed it. Then i got it for Xmas the same year and I just watched it a couple days ago. This, I think, is the best outta all of them.<br /><br />STORY: In 2002, Austin is still shagadelic. He one time stops Dr. Evil's plan he had and is knighted by the queen of England... only to find his dad did not attend. Dissapointed by his fazha's(as GM says)failure to attend, He then stops by Dr. Evil's prison and is informed to go back to 1975 and rescue him. but then, a Dutch henchman named Goldmember kidnaps him, takes him back to 2002, and then Austin, and a chick named Foxxy Cleopatra meanwhile Dr. Evil escapes with Mini Me from prison, and start fresh on a sub going into Japan.<br /><br />THOUGHTS: Awesome! I liked how Fat Bastard has T**ts in this one. And HARD KNOCK LIFE from "Annie", thats hilarious!<br /><br />You should own all AP movies! Especially this!</p></body></html>

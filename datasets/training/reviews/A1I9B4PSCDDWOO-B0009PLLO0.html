<meta name="summary" content="Alexander the Bore"></head><body><p>This is probably Oliver Stone's worst movie. To start things off, for two and half hours, it was quite boring to say the least. The narrative story was jerky and there was so much talk. It was like watching a day time soap opera. The sad thing was, nothing truly important was being said. People who watch this movie will never understand who, what or why of Alexander the Great. All we see is that he went here, won there, been there and done that. You can probably get all the information you need by watching an History Channel show or something.<br /><br />Much of the disappointment in the movie lies with Colin Farrell. While a good actor, he totally lack the chrismatic quality of Alexander the Great. Also lacking was Alexander's sheer genius which often borderline on madness. Alexander was bold with a purpose and he made his own fortune. Perhaps the scripts let Farrell down. God knows that Oliver Stone must have borrowed every single cliches known in Hollywood to filled Alexander's lines that failed to inspire any one of us. I may be in the minority here but I thought personally that Farrell was way over his league in his role. He lacks the screen presence to make us aware of Alexander and if he wasn't a lead actor or shouting very loudly, he could have easily disappeared within the ranks. Compared that with Russell Crowe in Gladiator. You always know where he is, quiet or not!! Anglina Jolie must have cost Stone a lot of money because he does his best to insert her whenever he can into the movie. Unfortunately for Stone, Jolie's role could have been done in ten minute but for some reason, Stone seem to hammered us audience how weird, loving and sinster Alexander's mom was. Her role wasn't believable and it was grossly overdone. Vil Kilmer and Anthony Hopkins were okay at best. Kilmer probably captured King Phillip pretty well. Hopkins playing a narrator had a thankless role trying to educated the audience 15 years of some of the most amazing events in history into few lines!!<br /><br />Historically, Alexander was bisexual and point could be...so what? This homoerotic theme that Stone played around throughout the movie proves to be total distraction to the main theme of the movie. What was the theme? I thought it was to discover what made Alexander....Alexander the Great!!! Maybe I and rest of the audience was wrong on that.<br /><br />Alexander is considered to be one of history's greatest military commanders, his life was filled with battles, sieges and combat. But in the movie, all we see is two battles, short and sweet. We see little of what make him great, only that he like to charge head first into battle. (Mel Gibson also makes the same mistake in Braveheart when he turned a tactically intelligent William Wallace into a banzai warrior.)<br /><br />Frankly, I don't see any real purpose in this movie. Narrative is boring, action is boring, acting is repetitively boring and considering that this is a movie about one of history's greatest military and political leaders, how can it be so boring??</p></body></html>

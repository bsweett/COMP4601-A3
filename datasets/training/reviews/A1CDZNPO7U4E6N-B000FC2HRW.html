<meta name="summary" content="The 3rd Sequel Curse strikes again!"></head><body><p>It never fails. If you somehow manage to get through the first and second film it's always at this point in most franchises where it usually goes down in flames. They manage to flush all the ideas that made the first 2 films so good right down the toilet. Personally, I'm stil confused as hell about the ending. The first 2 films had new and interesting concepts, but this whole rollercoaster thing was dumb. I wonder who do we have to thank for that horrible idea. Is that the best they could come up with? A rollercoaster? On top of that, the first 2 films found a way to tie in together, and in my opinion, that's very important. I hate it when they have sequels with no continuity, and sequels that have absolutely nothing to do with the 1st 2 movies. I think American filmakers need to follow a few tips from a moviegoer that has seen her fair share of movies.<br /><br />#1-To make a good plot...the story must first be INTERESTING!<br /><br />#2-You can't keep sticking to the same scare tactics. What creeped me out last time won't work the 2nd time around. It's just not as effective.<br /><br />#3-Don't ignore the previous films in the franchise. I don't care if it's part 3, 30, or 300. The viewers haven't forgotten what they've seen, and we can't be fooled. So, the movie needs to make sense.<br /><br />#4-If you're gonna branch off and tell another whole story let the movie stand on it's own. Don't call it the same as it's predecessors.<br /><br />#5-Quit using blood and gore as a replacement for originality, plot, and storyline.<br /><br />I think that if they would've reversed it and made the ending on the train the beginning, and went from there it might have been better. Another thing, it was a whole lot creepier when they had to figure out the signs that death was about to strike. The signs weren't explained in a photograph. I have said this before, and I'll say it again. Whether they are American or Canadian filmakers the premise still remains the same, and they need to understand that you can't just rely on showing a whole bunch of gory, nasty, and bloody scenes to the audience everytime you run out of ideas, and you know the movie blows. I notice they tend to do that quite often these days. They replace the plot and storyline for blood and violence. That's not entertainment, that's a distraction, and it's plan-B just in case plan-A doesn't work. Distract us from the fact that the movie is so bad and show us a lot of scenes to gross us out instead. They know that our society is based on so much violence that's enough to satisfy a lot of people. However, I'm not so easily impressed. I truely think any real fan of the first 2 movies won't appreciate this one. 2 stars is really being way 2 kind.</p></body></html>

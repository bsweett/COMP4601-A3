<meta name="summary" content="District 9 turned out to be the Toilet...?"></head><body><p>SPOILERS : I don't walk out on movies but this one made it necessary for many. Camera footage was very shaky and made many leave the showing I attended due to motion sickness.. On a small TV it may be less intense.. as for the movie itself ( now I am not by any means a sci-fi buff...) I enjoy a good movie.. that's it.. this movie SUCKED.. storyline was simplistic but at the same time I expected some real action to unfold which never did.. the ending, which left me ready to set the screen ablaze, left you and the movie unanswered with the hollow feeling of maybe the next movie would be better... which apparently worked for many who thought it was good.. but for me... and that's all I care about and I believe many think as I do...This Movie= very little action, poor storyline! made you constantly feel something was getting started and you are left wanting when it never does! NEXT!<br /><br />The viewer will ask these questions... how if the humans brought them down from the ship did they have and keep their weapons to trade with the cat food dealers..? ( which was a absolute joke )They were supposed to be timid... and that was the reason for them to not be worried about them using the weapons, yet many fought the police... why not with the very superior weapons they had.. no leader? not 1 to lead any to revolt ( which is what I waited for the hole time)... I could go on, but who cares.. movie had too many holes to be interesting. Add that to no real action and you get a real lame movie.</p></body></html>

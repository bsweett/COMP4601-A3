<meta name="summary" content="It's pretty but Crouching Tiger was better"></head><body><p>Set in what we know today as China but about 2000 years ago Hero is told in several sections and gets kind of confusing at times. Apparently the king of Qin, one of six sections of the future China, has been troubled for years by three assassins. One day a nameless man (Jet Li) comes in and tells the tale of how he has defeated the King's enemies. The king listens and then tells him that wasn't the way it was , it was this way and proceeds to tell the story a different way (in his version apparently only one of the killers is apparently dead and Li is working with the other two). Both versions use flashbacks and a lot of detail & locations as well as a predominating color in each story's segments.<br /><br />It was very interesting to look at, I loved a lot of the details but found the use of color distracting.<br /><br />I don't remember how I might've rated Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but I think I liked it better overall. Ziyi Zhang ws in both movies, I'd like to see more of her work.</p></body></html>

The only problem I had is he tried to stuff so much into one film that it seemed like he was trying to hard. Still entertaining and not as polished as Devil's Rejects. The commentary is great as always because Zombie is honest about his films and gives good insight to what he was thinking.<br /><br />A major reason too get this dvd is the dvd menu. Its probably the best dvd menu ever.</p></body></html>

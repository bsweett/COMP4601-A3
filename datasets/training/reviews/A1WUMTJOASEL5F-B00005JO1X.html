<meta name="summary" content=""Edmund, you look so cold!""></head><body><p>Chilling words from one of my favorite witches from Disney. Boy, she is so, so. . . coldhearted, and she is not afraid to show it!<br /><br />The magical sets, awesome musical backgrounds, dramatic and charming acting from the children, as well as CGI cast, all make a harmonious blend of a children's movie that's good enough for adults, and cult lovers of original storybook.<br /><br />I don't have any complaints, and don't mind the brief extras, mainly outtakes and bloopers. The movie is well crafted and totally endearing to watch. Disney really needs to concentrate on making more movies like this one, as well as Pirates Of The Caribbean. I miss the old days when Disney meant good comedy, drama, high spirit adventure, and musicals. Not just animation, and Pixar! The other releases, through affiliates with Touchstone Pictures, doesn't all together do it for me. Back in the real hey days it was "Walt Disney presents. . ." That's the way it should be, and that's the way Chronicles Of Narnia is basically marketed.</p></body></html>

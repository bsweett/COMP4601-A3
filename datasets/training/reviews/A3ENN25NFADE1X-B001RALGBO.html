<meta name="summary" content=""The Perfect Disaster Movie""></head><body><p>This film, destroys L.A, floods New York City, and puts the world in an ice age. Dennis Quad can finnaly say he was in a box office success. What I expect from an action film is enough acting to keep me interested and a whole lot of action, "From Dusk Till Dawn", is a perfect example, and so is the "Die Hard" series. I don't care what anybody says, this is a good film.</p></body></html>

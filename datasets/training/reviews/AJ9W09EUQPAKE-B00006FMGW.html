<meta name="summary" content="DiCaprio outwits the law in tight trousers"></head><body><p>The inspiration for this implausible story about a teenage conman who swindles his way to a cool $2 million before his 21st birthday is actually, as most people planning to purchase this DVD will know, a true premise. Frank Abagnale Jnr attained brief fame in the 1960s when he became the youngest American ever to appear on the FBI's most wanted list and his autobiography, published in 1980, chronicling his underhand escapades, became a cult bestseller.<br /><br />It appears that Steven Spielberg was one of those readers, or at any rate, was inspired to recreate this story on the big screen by some convincing source or another as this is not an orthodox Spielberg film. It fits neither into the category of his most recent, darker themed movies, A.I: Artificial Intelligence and Minority Report, nor the large scale epics emphasising tender children's emotions (E.T., Hook), large scale historical drama (Schindler's List) or blockbuster thrill sensations (Jurassic Park).<br /><br />No, Catch Me if You Can is something rather different. Ostensibly it is a dramatic comedy. Di Caprio is cast as the dashing, raffish Frank Jnr - except that his clothes for some reason are always a size too small. It is never quite clear why he feels the need to become one of America's most notorious criminals, but we are given the impression that deep family psychological anxieties play a large part - Frank Jnr is angry with his mother Paula who dumps his father for someone more successful and has a touching desire to please his father, Frank Snr (Christopher Walken plays this role to acclaimed success). Rapidly and ingeniously he passes himself off as a pilot, doctor and lawyer - sometimes through necessity when his is on the verge of being caught, sometimes, it appears, through sheer boredom. His evades his captors because he is so clever, but also because the finest brains of the FBI that pursue him are represented by Carl Hanretty (Tom Hanks) who, with his middle aged family problems, paunch and dogged rather than lightning quick intellect, frequently and comically lets Frank get away.<br /><br />This is not a deep film but several issues are explored. Frank's weakness for women is a continuous theme throughout the film, many different types of women - high class prostitutes (whom he cons) and the naive, brace wearing Brenda Strong (Amy Adams) who's tender innocence captures Frank's heart for a while and he becomes engaged to her until the need to escape from the law forces him away again.<br /><br />There is also a respectful bond between Frank and Carl the FBI agent. Carl respect's Frank's ingenuity and cunning, Frank sees Carl as almost a father figure and admires his persistence to bring him to justice. There is a clever solution that reconciles both these two factors. You'll have to watch the movie to find it out.<br /><br />So a Spielberg comedy. The man has nothing to prove, he can do pretty much what he likes now. It probably won't go down as one of the Spielberg greats, but it is slick, realistic and the plot keeps revolving with enough action to just about justify the length (over two hours). The 60s theme is done well too. As well as the tight trousers, the film is set to a minimalist jazz soundtrack with some evocative saxophone solos from Dan Higgins.</p></body></html>

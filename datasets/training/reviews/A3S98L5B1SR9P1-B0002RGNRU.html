Basically, he meets a girl, and they fall in love. Well, trouble brews between them, and the girl, Clementine, decides to erase all memory of Joel. Finding out about this, Joel decides to go through with the procedure himself. Halfway through Joel fights desperately to keep his memories of Clementine alive because he doesn't want to forget her. The best part of the movie is inside Joels mind as he tries to hold on to the memories he has left. Cinematography plays a HUGE role in effectively showing Joels mind, and in the beginning it seems kind of creepy as everything is kind of shadowy and dark. It is a great way to symbolize our thinking onto the big screen. During the end, the plot goes a little awry, but eventually fits into the end story. I believe the weakest moments of this film are when the movie goes to the scenes that focus on the people performing the memory erasure. Elijah Wood is also in the movie, which kind of ruined it for me because i still see him as Frodo from the Lord of the Rings. I feel that movies have more of a realistic quality when the actors are people I don't know. Sure Jim Carrey is someone I know, but he plays the part so well that he doesn't ruin the movie. So because of these small flaws i listed, Eternal Sunshine gets a 4 out of 5. It is definately a great movie to watch, and is quite moving at some points. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do so when it comes out to rent, or to buy. A fantastic movie all around that really makes you think at parts.</p></body></html>

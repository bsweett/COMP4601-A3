<meta name="summary" content="F/X is a poor substitute for a plot"></head><body><p>Years ago, I had the pleasure of seeing "Rent" on Broadway.  I thought the play was hilarious.  But while watching it I noticed something peculiar: I was laughing when no one else was.  Many times during the course of watching DAT I had a similar experience.  What made it so funny for me were the clich&eacute;s piled so high they practically snowed New York under all by themselves, and the general plot holes, PC speechifying, and all-around sloppy writing.<br /><br />The clich&eacute;s, oh lord the clich&eacute;s.  U2 actually made a very good song out of a nonstop string of clich&eacute;s ("With or Without You"); I guess the writers of DAT were attempting to do something similar here.  They failed.<br /><br /> Here are but a few of DAT's kitschy, classic clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />The lines:<br /><br />* "Jack, you've been working for 24 hours straight; the only one who hasn't taken a break."<br />* "If we don't act now, it's going to be too late."<br />* "Let's get you out of those wet clothes."<br />* "I have to do this." "I know."<br />* "Sam might not have one more day."<br />* "I made my son a promise. I'm going to keep it."<br /><br />The scenes:<br /><br />* The boy with leukemia. The writers should've had the guts to just go ahead and name him "Timmy."<br />* If you're an ethnic floor polisher, or an ethnic New York City bum, your chances of surviving a disaster are very good indeed. If it's a choice between you and a bunch of white yuppies, you are practically guaranteed to survive.<br />* The speech-to-the-roomful-of-important-military-and-civilian-personnel scene. The only thing missing was Peter Sellers in a wheelchair with a German accent.<br /><br />Now, some of these clich&eacute;s might not rise to the level of "Dammit Jim, I'm just a simple country doctor, not a miracle worker!" but they all at least come close. I think the only way the movie could have been more clich&eacute;d would be if Michael Bay had directed.<br /><br />The plot holes, the PC-ness, the lack of common sense:<br /><br />* How exactly does cold weather cause wolves to get smart enough to bust out of the Manhattan Zoo? Also, since when does the Manhattan Zoo have wolves? Sea lions -- yes. Penguins -- yes. Polar bears -- yes. Wolves -- no.<br />* Is it just me, or is Sela Ward a dead ringer for Michael Jackson?<br />* Again, how exactly does global warming cause a new ice age?<br />* Why did Jack come to rescue his son in the first place (and have one of his teammates die along the way, in yet another great clich&eacute;d scene -- the only thing missing was Quaid yelling "N-o-o-o-o-o!" in slow motion as his traveling companion fell to his death)? So he could be there when the rescue helicopters came?<br />* When he comes to rescue his son, why didn't Jack see the smoke from the burning books rising from the New York Public Library?<br />* Birds migrating south before the storm. Yeah, yeah, they're smarter than humans, I get it.<br />* Dick Chen -- er, Vice President Becker, giving a mea culpa, sorry-for-America-destroying-the-world-and-looking-down-on-Latin-America speech at the end of the flick. It sort of reminded me of the end to "The Jungle."<br /><br />I encourage you to buy this movie cheap, or to rent it.  I can't exactly call it camp; the movie cost too much to make to call it that.  F/X saves it from total ignominy.  Anyhow, watch DAT for the laughs, and maybe keep track of the rip-offs from every other disaster movie ever made and all the logic errors and propaganda along the way.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A history of violence indeed..."></head><body><p>When a 14-year-old prostitute dies giving birth, midwife Anna faces a problem.  The mother left behind a diary, which Anna's uncle begins to translate.  It spins the tale of a lost girl, caught up in the Russian mafia, fed tales of glandour and eventually taken advantage of.  Anna has unkowningly immersed herself into a world of trafficking, rape, and murder; and her new acquaintance, Nikolai, embodies the worst of all of those.<br /><br />I've made the plot to be a bit melodramatic; although, to be honest, it is.  Who really cares, though?  I don't.  I started "Eastern Promises" expecting a good piece of entertainment, along the lines of its Cronenberg/Mortensen predecessor, "A History of Violence."  An hour and a half later (the time having flown by), I was amazed.  I got what I expected, and much more.<br /><br />A lot has been said of Cronenberg's directing; I won't go into that too much.  If by now you aren't familiar with David Cronenberg, then I can't help you.  I'm going to focus on the acting, because that's what drew me in.  Naomi Watts is quickly becoming one of my favorite talents; she can convey so much emotion with the utterance of a single word.  Armin Mueller-Stahl is a scene-stealer as always; his understated mob boss performance is not only believable, it's downright chilling.  Vincent Cassell is simply delightful as he hops from one scene to the next; you can't tell whether to fear him or pity him.<br /><br />The real reason you're gonna watch this movie, however, and let's all be honest here, is for Viggo Mortensen's performance as Nikolai.  He is chilling; he is downright terrifying.  I can see why he's nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor; if he doesn't get it, it will be a downright shame (though Mortensen, a truly gifted performer who seems to take his art rather seriously, probably won't shed any tears over the loss).  The fight scene in the steam room will go down as a cinema classic; perfectly choreographed, perfectly acted.  You see a bit more of Mortensen than you really want to--well, ladies, maybe you have a different opinion--but it's all for the sake of art.<br /><br />And that's what "Eastern Promises" is, after all--art.  Cronenberg, in my opinion, is one of the most artful directors out there today.  He perfectly navigates the cannal between a study of violence and an explotation of it.  "Eastern Promises" is definitely a study of violence; there are questions raised that get unanswered, but it's not Cronenberg's job to answer them.  He's just a director.  You, the audience, must decide the answers for yourself.  So don't watch this movie, or any Cronenberg movie, unless you're willing to do some thinking.  But we'll forgive you if, for an hour and a half, you just sit back and enjoy the show.</p></body></html>

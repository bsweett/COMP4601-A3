<meta name="summary" content="I sincerely hope this was NOT Sidney Lumet's swan song!"></head><body><p>The only thing I enjoyed about watching BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD was seeing Marisa Tomei repeatedly naked!  That was a visual treat!  The rest of the movie was nothing short of painful for me; vile, despicable, unlikable characters taking us through a truly uninteresting story of two poor excuses for brothers who decide to rob their own parent's jewelry store (the locale of the store that was supposed to be Westchester was actually Bayside, Queens).  Of course, the robbery goes wrong and blood is spilled.<br /><br />I usually enjoy robbery/heist movies, provided the crime is perpetrated by somewhat intelligent and likeable characters.  Not ONE performer in this film is capable of providing either trait.<br /><br />Despite this horrible viewing experience, I will try my best to remember that Sidney Lumet is still a legendary director who is responsible for films like 12 ANGRY MEN, SERPICO, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, DOG DAY AFTERNOON, NETWORK and PRINCE OF THE CITY.</p></body></html>

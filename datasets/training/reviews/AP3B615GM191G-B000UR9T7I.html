<meta name="summary" content="The Best Of The Bunch"></head><body><p>While watching the first two Spiderman films, I was impressed by a few things but also turned off by some as well.  I loved the action scenes and the sly little references to the Peter Parker/Spiderman duel identity, but was never really drawn into the Parker-Mary Jane romance or the development (or lack thereof of villains Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus).<br /><br />Thus, in stark contrast to most Amazon reviewers, I considered Spiderman 3 to be the best of the bunch due to a focus on even more action, plus better acting by Tobey Maguire as Parker/Spidey.  While still progressing the Peter/MJ relationship that screenwriters Miles Millar and Al Gough pretty much ruined in the second film, those scenes take a back seat to Spidey's struggles to fend off three new villains: Hob-Goblin, Sandman, and Venom.<br /><br />With the exception of Parker's friend Harry's Hob-Goblin, which got the short shrift of screen time, I considered both the other villains to be much more interesting than any previous ones.  Sandman actually had some character development that made him a true enemy of Parker, while Venom is probably the most interesting element of the entire Spiderman cannon.<br /><br />Besides that focus on action, though, was a much better performance by Maguire.  Likely do to the very interesting changes he undergoes while battling with Venom, Maguire is able to emote much more wildly/effectively than in the previous movies (where a wide-eyed stare was about all that ever happened).  I especially the scene in which Parker, under the full control of Venom, takes a night out on the town...hilarious!<br /><br />Thus, since I was never really drawn into the relationships/drama of the Spiderman franchise in the first place, I rate this film a cut above the rest for its focus on more action/fight scenes.  I can say with confidence that it did NOT kill the film franchise as many other reviewers are suggesting.</p></body></html>

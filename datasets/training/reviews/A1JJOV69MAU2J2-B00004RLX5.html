<meta name="summary" content="The funniest, and most accessible Trek film"></head><body><p>This is the Trek movie that even people who don't like Trek movies enjoy. A heartwarming if preposterous tale that has our intrepid crew going back in time to 1986 to find some whales, who it turns out, are the key to saving the world circa 2282, this fun frolic in San Fran has tons of laughs, great interplay among the cast and lots of campy but good moments.</p></body></html>

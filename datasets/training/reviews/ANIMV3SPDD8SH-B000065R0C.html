<meta name="summary" content="DON'T STOP THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT FEW MINUTES"></head><body><p>Lola receives a frantic phone call form her boyfriend. He will be killed by his gangster bosses in twenty minutes if he doesn't come up with one hundred thousand deutsche marks, the amount he lost in a botched money transfer. So Lola runs, literally, into the streets of Germany, hoping to find means to the money in twenty minute's time.<br /><br />Lola is sweet, worldly and young and so is her boyfriend. They need be, to gain our sympathy against the common but evil financier status quo of Europe. Their attempt to beat the clock against an impossible task, is the one and only subject matter of the film. The story, or idea, is told in a fast paced, rock video style narrative, part light humor, part sharp suspense, with lightning strike synonymous time frames of the same characters and situations, projecting Lola's stressed mental state of adrenaline rushed physical endurance and high powered decision making.<br /><br />By the time Lola starts out on her third attempt to save the day, (it's the charmer), you might begin to wonder  how the film will pull itself out of it's self-imposed infinity, as it flails deep into a hole of pretense tempting filmmaking and already dated Euro-trash musical score. But it does, as happily as an adult, lust rewarding fairy tale. While we view a detailed visual feast of a gothic German metropolis as backdrop,  it is the sight of the shapely, but not particularly athletic Lola running that captures our attention. Indeed, there is a lady or a tiger at the end of this road, or in this case, a pot o' eurodollars or certain death. Like a modern day 'Diana and the Golden Apples', our heroine radiates stamina and endurance and beauty as she runs down yet another crooked path. So run, Lola, run. You'll shed those few extra pounds yet.</p></body></html>

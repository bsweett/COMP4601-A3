<meta name="summary" content=""Sick" For "Sicko""></head><body><p>There's a saying, the best way to judge a country is by the way it treats the poor and sick. I hope other countries have number one, never heard of this saying and number two, never see this movie. Michael Moore's "Sicko" is a harsh look at the U.S. health-care system and the government's inability to take care of its citizens.<br /><br /> Moore's documentary is not about the 47 million Americans who are uninsured. Instead the film is about those who are insured but have fallen through the cracks of the system. When injured they are usually denied on their claims and are left to pay for medical expenses themselves. The film has a host of incidents in which this has happened. One man accidently cuts off two of his fingers with a power saw. The hospital tells he is only covered for one. He must pick which one he wants put back on. One of his fingers will cost $60,000 the other $12,000. He decides to go with the $12,000 finger as the other one is thrown away.<br /><br /> Stories such as this one are countered with stories from people from other countries including Canada, London and France where the citizens have universal health-care. They laugh at Moore when he asked them how much a visit to the hospital cost. When he asks them "why are you laughing"? They say because they've never been asked such a question.<br /><br /> I'm a big fan of Moore's films. I enjoyed his last film "Fahrenheit 9/11". I thought it was one of the best films of 2004. I also liked "Bowling for Columbine". While I don't think the film is as good as "Fahrenheit 9/11" just because it wasn't as rabble rousing to me, "Sicko" is still a call for action. It filled me with contempt. Why can't America help and take care of all of us. Why are millions of people, including myself, without health-care. My job doesn't even offer me coverage because I work part-time. If God forbid something should happen to me, I don't even want to think what would happen to me.<br /><br /> Lots of people complain Michael Moore hates America, in fact a movie was made about Moore with that exact same title, but why? Because he exposes unpleasant truths about this country? Well, isn't that just too bad. I feel it's more of an injustice if someone sees something wrong in this country and says nothing then if someone speaks out, even if others don't want to hear it.<br /><br /> Is Moore's film fair and balanced? Probably not. No big shots from the medical companies are interviewed. No doctors, well Americans ones anyway, are either. Moore doesn't try to explain their side at all. It is a completely one-sided agrument. But, guess what? I don't want to hear their excuses. Moore makes it very simple when he says HMO's are strickly out to make profit. They don't want to pay for your medical expenses. That is considered a "medical lost". The object is to take all of your money and never provide you with coverage. When dealing with "people" like that, who wants to hear their side? How do you justify such behavior? We understand all we need to know. They are money hungry. It's business, it's not personal. All they see is dollar and cents. We see people suffer.<br /><br /> I don't know if this was Moore's intention, it probably wasn't, but this was the first film I ever saw which convinced me to want to live in another country. When you see the way people in Canada and France live, for instance, did you know they get five weeks of paid vacation? A week's paid vacation for their honeymoon? The government sends someone to help new mom's take care of their children for no charge? Doctors make house calls? Who wouldn't want such benefits. And the kicker is, they work a 35 hour week! I already have a passport, I'm just packing my bags.<br /><br /> Many people claim the film is Moore's best. As I said, I don't agree, but, the documentary will make you look at the world differently. It will make you think. It is a call for action. Moore doesn't explore all the details. Like, how much in taxes does all this cost? Moore never interviews truly poor and sick people from these other countries, he only interviews sick people from America. Is it because of our health-care system we have all these sick people and these other countries don't or did Moore do this on purpose just to make his point? Either way, I don't care. It's just something to think about.<br /><br /> In the end "Sicko" is one of the year's best films. It was an incredible experience for me which changed the way I look at the world and the direction I want to lead my life. Will others have the same experience? Will they be as struck by this film as I was? Who knows. If they've ever been sick they might.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: This harsh look at the U.S. health-care system is one of the year's best. It is a call of action and will get your emotions going into high gear.</p></body></html>

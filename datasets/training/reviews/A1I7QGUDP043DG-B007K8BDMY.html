I had a better understanding of who he was and his passion for nature. However, in my opinion, Timothy might've accomplished more if he'd spent time with Native Americans and learned how they bond with nature without being intrusive.<br /><br />Though his heart was in the right place, Treadwell clearly made mistakes. He had a true love of animals, so I do feel deeply for his loss. I recall a kind man in Florida who loved gators and fed a young one daily. It soon grew huge and came into yards to eat family pets. It was just a matter of time before it ate a toddler, etc. and was hunted down. In many cases, we forget that wild animals are far safer if they remain afraid of humans. This movie weighs both sides of that issue without heavily blaming Treadwell for the tragedy that ended him and his girlfriend's life.</p></body></html>

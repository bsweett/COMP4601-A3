However... there are a number of things I did not like about this film.<br />First, the billing. The previews led you to believe this is a horror film. I recall quick scenes where they showed bugs crawling just under the skin, which didn't happen in the movie. Major points off for being misleading.<br />Second... this is not a thriller by any stretch of the imagination. This is a study in two parts.First part being how easily some people can succumb to the influence of others, especially if they are emotionally fragile for whatever reason (lonely, drug addicted, etc.). Second part being how much in need they are of attention.... whether it's good or bad attention, it's still attention. So more major points off for being misleading in script also.<br />What I will say is that the acting was excellent. Each character, sans the doctor, was believable. The doctor's character was too too out there. What would have happened in real life is not what happened in this movie. Police would have been called and involuntary warrants for admission to a psychiatric place would have been issued, especially after viewing how the interior of the home had been altered.<br />But... I firmly believe they went for some gore so they could use it for misleading billing. Bad, bad move.<br />This movie would have done better as a pure study in how insanity/paranoia can be transmitted and the decline that follows.<br />It's a shame really. The pretense is strong. Put a lonely, emotionally unstable woman together with a mentally sick man and watch what happens. And it does happen.<br />The points I took off were for misleading billing in script and in trailers. Incongruent story line, especially with the doctor and a misleading plot. Nowhere in this film do the police come into play.<br />What was good, but wasted, was the acting by all involved, again, sans the doctor. He was there for the gore factor.<br />All in all, I would have to say, don't waste your time. There's much better films about the decline into insanity. Watch 'Girl Interrupted' if you want a true, solid story line in this genre.</p></body></html>

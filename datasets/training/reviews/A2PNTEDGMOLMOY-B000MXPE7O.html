<meta name="summary" content="Tedious yet realistic depiction of the birth of the CIA"></head><body><p>I tried my hardest to fall in love with Robert De Niro's "The Good Shepherd."  All the elements were there for a great film - fantastic material (the birth of the CIA and the Cold War), great cast, and more-than-ample budget.  Unfortunately, the total is far less than the sum of its parts - and far more tedious.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson, privileged Yale undergraduate who gets inducted into America's least-secret secret society, Skull and Bones.  Given this access to privilege, Wilson receives a unique opportunity - to get in on the ground floor of America's new secret service, the OSS (the forerunner of the CIA).  Over the next few decades, Wilson will play a key part in the evolution of the Cold War.<br /><br />This should be exciting stuff.  Terrific authors have had loads of fun with the very same material - John Le Carre, Robert Littell, James Ellroy - and their novels are riveting page-turners.  Thanks in large part to Damon's depiction of Wilson as an extremely cold fish, "The Good Shepherd" is largely an exercise in exposition and tedium.  Events transpire, characters grow old or die young, and bitterness and recrimination stalk the land.  Sometimes that works in a movie - this is not such an occasion.<br /><br />Put "The Good Shepherd" on the shelf with the Great Missed Opportunities of recent years - movies that should have been terrific and yet failed to live up to expectations.</p></body></html>

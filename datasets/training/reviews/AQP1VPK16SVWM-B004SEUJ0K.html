<meta name="summary" content=""X-Men" wrapped up with a bang 3 1/2 stars bigger but not necessarily better"></head><body><p>Everyone probably knows the plot from the trailer or TV advertisements (I have a synopsis at the end of this for those that are interested in reading about it). Comic book fans can rejoice as Angel and Beast have finally been introduced into the X-Men films.<br /><br />How has Brett Ratner done with the third "X-Men" film? Well the good news for those who had their doubts about Ratner is that he didn't screw it up. The main story points were written before he came on board while Singer was still attached to the project so, in many respects, this is an extension of Singer's first two films. The screenplay manages to pack quite a bit of action and resolution into it considering the film runs under two hours. Ratner does a great job setting up the action scenes and even does a solid job during the quieter character moments.<br /><br />The visual effects are stunning particularly a sequence involving Magneto moving the Golden Gate Bridge. There were a few scenes where the visuals weren't 100% convincing (those involving Angel)but on the whole the production is top notch. While Ratner focuses on the action and humor at the expense of the drama at times, he's crafted a fine film that holds up well when compared to the first two installments directed by Bryan Singer.<br /><br />Some fans of the comic book or animated series will probably object to the liberities taken with the storyline and characters but many of the important themes that were handled in the comic book receive their due here. Kelsey Grammer is terrific as Beast even though he probably could have used a bit more screen time and James Marsden although he's used effectively could probably have had his role pumped up a bit as well. While Famke Janssen does a marvelous job in her dual role I felt that she also was under utilized a bit.<br /><br />Synposis:<br />Still grieving over the loss of Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen)Cyclops (James Marsden)has shirked his duties teaching the kids at "mutant high". Wolverine (Hugh Jackman)steps in but expresses his concern to Cyclops and suggest he needs to "move on". Hearing Jean's voice in his head Cyclops leaves the school. A pharmaceutical company has developed a cure for the mutations a medication that will suppress the mutant gene permanently. Rogue (Anna Paquin) is for it while others such as Wolverine, Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Storm (Halle Berry) are against it. Magneto rallies more mutants to his cause in hopes of destroying the vaccine which he sees as humanity's attempt to eradicate mutants and make them like everyone else. The X-Men augmented by Beast (Kelsey Grammer perfectly cast), Kitty (Ellen Page) and Colossus(Daniel Cudmore) and Magneto end up butting heads against each other as he's concerned about the threat to humanity from Magneto and his hoard. There's a mutant in town that could help Magneto succeed--Phoenix the most powerful mutant on the face of the Earth.</p></body></html>

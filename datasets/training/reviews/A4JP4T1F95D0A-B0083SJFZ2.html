I liked the original Clash when it was released when I was a kid, now it seems very campy and not as good for me.  This Clash takes a very serious tone, though there are some humorous characters to lighten things up.  Though it is great on big special effects and does follow the path of the original in the basic story, there is something lacking in this movie that I can't put my finger on.  I watched it and did enjoy it, but when it ended it didn't really bring any emotion out of me.  The story ideas seemed good, but not fully complete.  It feels like they just missed with this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great baseball film"></head><body><p>Not about the players, but about the back stage team that forms it.  Brad Pitt did a great job of acting, and he should stick more to these kinds of films because his acting ability shines through so much more than action films. I especially liked it because I live in Baltimore and the Orioles have fallen down to nothing because of poor management and the unwillingness of the rich owner to spend any money on better players.  Beyond that, he's not even a baseball fan and doesn't care what happens to the team as long as he doesn't have to spend much money.  The team has declined more and more since he bought it, and is in last place, all good players sold.<br /><br />Everyone in town would be happy to see Moneyball happen here.  We could use a different approach.  If the manager ever leaves or retires or dies, his sons will take the money with them.  It won't go for the team.  I loved this movie, because it does show that if a team has a clever manager and the right know how, even a team with little money can bring back the fans.  It should only happen to us.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Has restored my faith in Disney movies"></head><body><p>There's been a buy one, get one free deal on Disney movies in the UK recently. I treated myself to Robin Hood and Sword In The Stone. Those were the two I could find. The rest I had no interest in even picking up. Disney movies never appealed to me after Pocahontas came out, and I've rarely watched one since. The big movies recently have been the Incredibles, Finding Nemo, Cars etc, some with Pixar at the helm. But I never jumped at the chance to get any of them. They just didn't have the same appeal as the old Disney classics.<br /><br />Instead of sitting at home after a long day at work, I decided to go see this with my boyfriend, which meant lots of rushing about trying to make myself look presentable, but surprisingly worth it. Many of the people I work with know of my distaste for animation, and instantly said I wouldn't enjoy this.<br /><br />There were a handful of kids at the cinema. The rest were adults. I'm still not keen on being in the cinema with kids - there was a child a few rows in front of us, who got taken to the toilet a couple of times, but who was always away for at least 20 minutes! Why bother? And then there was the child who had a seriously high pitched laugh, and who I'm yet to figure out whether it was a boy or girl.<br /><br />Ratatouille surprised me, it really did. From the pre-credit sequence (something that doesn't seem to really match up to the rest of the movie) which was hilarious, to Remy, the rat with a taste for good cuisine, the movie was good. Slightly too long for my taste, I was starting to get restless, but it was funny, and well done. The pre-credit sequence with the aliens, was so funny, and I've been walking around the day after seeing it, and laughing to myself.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most about this was the lack of real celebrity voices. There were three I could pick out, maximum. Peter O'Toole was the voice of Anton Ego, Janeane Garofalo was the voice of Collette, and Jamie Oliver (famous British chef) is the voice of the health inspector. Normally these days every character is voiced by a celebrity.<br /><br />The plot is quite funny, although will make you hungry, but I won't give any of it away here. There is a story behind this, which is basically don't let anyone tell you that you can't do something. You can and you will. I thought it was quite subtle. It is quite simplistic at the same time, from the animation style, to the story. Whether it will become a classic I don't know, but I've added the DVD to my wishlist, as I really want to watch that pre-credit sequence again. I can't persuade anyone to go see this film, I wouldn't have managed to persuade ME to go see this film, but I like it when I get surprised by a movie I wouldn't have thought I would have liked.</p></body></html>

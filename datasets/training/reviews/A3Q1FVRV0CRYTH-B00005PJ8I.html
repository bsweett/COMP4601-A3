Hanks is a wonderfully talented actor who proves that here with what I believe to be his finest performance to date.  As Fed-X employee Chuck, Hanks is stranded on a deserted island after a plane crash and is left to fend for himself woth no one to keep him company but a ball named Wilson for four years.  Watching him survive may not sound like watchable entertainment but it is, it truly is, and when he's finially able to make it home your cheering for him because you feel like you know him and you missed him and your so happy he made it out alive.  Hanks proves that he is one of our generations finest leading men and this film goes down as one of my favorites for that very reason.</p></body></html>

A movie that is majorly responsible for this masochistic horror sub-genre, that's really is only an excuse to see people graphically tortured & mutilated, without any redeeming qualities. I was WRONG!<br /><br />I had just got Netflix streaming & there was "Saw." I thought to myself, why not, lets see what all the hoopla is about. I mean a film that is pretty much responsible for a whole horror sub-genre, has to have something going for it, right? Right! I was very pleasantly surprised! Here we have a film with a white knuckled terrific plot, what would you do to save yourself? Great acting, an intelligent script, great pacing & direction, & it was more than just a torture porn flick, it had redeeming qualities & characters. It was not what I expected at all! It was actually closer to films like "Silence of the Lambs" & "Seven, & was the best film of that ilk since those great movies! I was almost dumbfounded, & thought, why did I wait so long!<br /><br />"Saw" is a movie that every horror & non-horror fan should see. It is a shining example of how to get much mileage out of a film, with no gas money. Though I'm not inspired to check out it's sequels, as most sequels get progressively worse, this is a film I'll watch many more times, & recommend!<br /><br />A cutting edge film!</p></body></html>

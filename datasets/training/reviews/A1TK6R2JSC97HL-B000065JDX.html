"Dusk" is actually two hyper-violent movies.  The first half tracks the sociopath Gecko brothers (Tarantino & Clooney) as they escape across Texas with the fruits of their latest heist.  Their goal: Mexico, where they will find sanctuary with a crime lord played by Marin.  To get across the border, they hijack an RV driven by Harvey Keitel (as a lapsed preacher) and his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis).  At first hostages, Keitel and co. bond with the crazy Gecko's if only to keep them from killing anybody.  Once in Mexico, things change quickly - Gecko's meeting is placed at some horrid cross-border bar/strip-club/brothel.  At first, it appears to be the Gecko's kind of place - until the bar's owners reveal themselves to be vicious, blood sucking vampires.  Trapped inside the hellish bar, and barely surviving the first battle with the vampires, the Gecko's forge an uneasy alliance with the remaining human patrons - their hostages, as well as a cool vet named Frost (Fred Williamson) and a biker played by horror legend Tom Savini.  Their goal - to survive the night.<br /><br />This was not only an extremely violent, gory and supercharged movie, but seems to exist for that alone.  The script posits gratuitous action for no purpose.  Even the vampire plot seems to drop out of nowhere, ending an interesting rapport between Clooney and Keitel.  Trapped inside the evil bar, it's less a movie than an R-rated Haunted-House ride.  That said, the movie is godawful fun, with Rodriguez painfully and hysterically finding different ways for the humans to dispatch the vampires.  The script is laced with wicked lines - most by George Clooney.  This has to be one of the most wickedly guilty pleasures since "The Last Boy Scout" and about the furthest thing you can get from a chick-flick.</p></body></html>

Basically, without spoiling the actual storyline, everything you see in the beginning of the movie isn't actually happening.  The question is, WILL it happen, or will Sandra Bullock be able to stop it in time?<br /><br />There's a twist at the very end of the movie that I NEVER seen coming, and to be totally honest, I don't quite understand what happened during the last two minutes of the movie.  If someone wants to explain it to me in the comment field below, please do!<br /><br />Anyway, the acting was really good, Sandra's character was in good shape, the guessing game deciding what's happening in the present time and what HASN'T happened yet is something you will be trying to figure out for yourself while watching the movie.<br /><br />Too many times I was never really sure what was happening for real and what was just a premonition of Sandra's character.  You love movies like this because you just never know if someones premonitions will eventually happen or if the future disasters that come to someones mind can be stopped in time.  This is another one of those movies, but done exceptionally well.  I recommend it.</p></body></html>

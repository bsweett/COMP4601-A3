<meta name="summary" content="A Great Movie, Made With Dino DNA! Highly Recommended"></head><body><p>The original Jurassic Park movie remains my favorite of the three in the series. Released in 1993, this was one of the first movies to heavily use CGI effects seamlessly in conjunction with live action. The overall effect is nothing short of unbelievable or, more to the point, totally believable dinosaurs interacting with humans.<br /><br />The movie's plot centers on a Paleontologist (well played by Sam Neill) who is hired to give his stamp of approval on a new "Theme" park ahead of its grand opening. There is also good casting and acting from Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum (a good fit as a "Chaos-tician"), Samuel L. Jackson (way underutilized), and Richard Attenborough (very likeable as the entrepreneur, John Hammond). Rounding out the main cast are two kids (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello as Hammond's grandchildren) and an annoying programmer (Wayne Knight, "Newman" from Seinfeld).<br /><br />The movie does require some suspension of disbelief and acceptance of pseudoscience but overall the plot is strong and the effects are believable.<br /><br />Once the action starts in this movie it really doesn't let up until the very end. This is one of the few movies that has the ability to keep you literally on the edge of your seat. I have "nervous" people in my family who can't watch the movie all of the way through because the tempo of the action is so intense. For that same reason it is one of my teenager's favorite movies.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!</p></body></html>

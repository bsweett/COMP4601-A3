GRIN Finally, a QUALITY two DVD set of this awesome classic Disney picture! I remember seeing Mary Poppins when I was much younger and this release does not disappoint! It is loaded with extras and the quality of the picture and sound is excellent!<br /><br />The plot of the movie involves Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins, a magical nanny who becomes the governess of the Banks children who have a stuffed shirt father. (By the way, this part is similar to the role Julie would play the following year as Maria in The Sound of Music.) How Mary finds out about the job is in itself magical since the father of the Banks children had thrown away the letter they wrote asking for a nanny! We never get to know where she came from, either! Mary uses her love and natural powers to bring joy to the Banks children without ever being too overbearingly "preachy." Later on in the movie the father is faced with the possible loss of his job and the moral of the story is delivered to the audience in a very well done fashion.<br /><br />The acting is superlative and the musical numbers are unforgettable. To this day "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" remains an extremely catchy song and the other songs like "Chim Chim Cher-ee" and "A Spoonful of Sugar" are completely enchanting!<br /><br />But there's more! This DVD set is loaded--and I mean loaded--with valuable extras that will entertain you and raise your understanding of how the film was made as well as its history. For example, there's "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious: The Making of Mary Poppins" - a new 50-minute documentary, footage of the "Gala Movie Premiere," and a make up test for Dyke Van Dyke. There are songs and games for children (and the children in us), too!<br /><br />After you see this you will understand why the movie got Julie Andrews a Best Actress Oscar (in her film debut, no less) and why Dick Van Dyke is so talented and perfect for his role as Mary's boyfriend. (Look for Van Dyke also in the role of the senior officer of the bank!) All together the film received 13 Oscar nominations including Best Song for "Chim Chim Cher-ee!" Although some of the technical effects are not the state of today's art, the film did receive Oscar awards for technical effects and music. Simply put, I highly recommend this two DVD set for Disney fans, Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke fans, and fans of musicals. This edition of Mary Poppins will not disappoint!</p></body></html>

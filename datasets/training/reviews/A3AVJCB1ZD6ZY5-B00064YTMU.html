<meta name="summary" content="Good viewing, but glad I didn't buy this film....."></head><body><p>I doubt I would want to watch "Collateral" more than once.<br /><br />Max (Jamie Foxx) is an LA cabdriver who dreams of owning a top-flight limo service.  He's just driving a cab til he can get the cash to do it right.  He drives at night:  the traffic's better, the tips are higher.<br /><br />He picks up Vincent (Tom Cruise), who offers him double his shift pay if he'll break the rules and take him to visit five 'friends.'  First stop, when a body lands on the cab, he realizes his passenger is a sociopathic killer performing hits for a drug dealer.<br /><br />This begins a surreal ride down the dark side of men's souls.  Max tries to get away, to stop what's happening, and is foiled at every point.<br /><br />Until the last hit.  It's Max's previous fare, a lovely US Attorney.  Will he be able to save her?  Himself?<br /><br />While the movie's premise was interesting and the action for the most part flowed well, there were long gaps of dialogue that took away from the action going on.  Further, one character who I had thought was going to be on Max's side got killed quickly.  What was the point of developing a character to that point and blowing him away?<br /><br />Overall, I think that was my major question about the movie.  What was the point?  My opinion, this film is not worth owning.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An underrated film, even better as the Director's Cut"></head><body><p>This film has been bashed up and down. Is it a "weak story" dependent on "special effects?"<br /><br />Not to me. The film has an awesome villian (and unlike most people, I use the word "awesome" sparingly), a huge and mysterious craft enveloped by a cloud. It's ominous mystery and deadly power could destroy the Earth itself.<br /><br />(SPOILER ALERT) As the craft is investigated, it's discovered to be an earth probe evolved and seeking it's creator. It needs to have meaning and purpose, much as the dispassionate and logical character of Spock needs.  It needs spirituality, hope and faith!<br /><br />Unlike what most reviewers claim, this movie does do justice to the Star Trek characters.<br /><br />Kirk is dissatisfied with being a desk jockey admiral, and wants to captain a starship once again.  His ego compels him to "compete" with the current captain of the Enterprise, a young "William Decker."<br /><br />Spock has been trained to erase most of his emotions, but finds this path of pure logic unfulfilling.<br /><br />McCoy is as tempermental and sarcastic as ever.<br /><br />This is a unique and imaginative movie, don't be fooled by the negative press.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel "The Shroud of Torrington."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Melancholy Look At Human Connections In A Monstrous World"></head><body><p>For the record, I was absolutely opposed to the idea of an American remake of the remarkable existential Swedish chiller "Let the Right One In."  A contemplative look at friendship, loyalty and forging connections, this vampire film eschewed conventional horror to work as a thoughtful character study.  With much quiet and intimacy, this was no ordinary blood bath--this was a serious attempt to conceptualize vampires in a modern context.  Sure, there were moments of genuine creepiness and scares, but there was much more underneath the surface.  Mainstream American horror films seldom do subtle and/or understated themes, so I prepared for the worst when Matt Reeves' "Let Me In" was announced.  But, to my astonishment and delight, Reeves understood what made the original unique and special.  With full integrity intact, this remake is supremely successful.<br /><br />The story centers around an awkward and lonely youth (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who spends many nights in isolation.  One night, he's approached by an enigmatic new neighbor (Chloe Grace Moretz) of similar age.  Although she seems equally alone, she proclaims that they can't be friends.  However, the two seem drawn to one another and, in fact, start to become close.  But this tentative juvenile romance has one striking difference--Moretz is a vampire.  Her dietary needs are met by Richard Jenkins who seems to be part guardian, part accomplice, part slave.  When bodies start to be discovered and Moretz's daily routine gets interrupted, things start to spiral out of control.  Are our young couple doomed?  And can Smit-McPhee accept the truth of his new friendship?<br /><br />Part of what makes this film so great is the attention to character.  The film is infused with a genuine melancholy and sadness--and the only respite from the gloom is in the friendship the two characters create.  She needs the human connection, he needs her strength--and together they grow stronger.  Their bond makes them both better for it as he struggles with bullying at school and she struggles for survival itself.  Underplayed to perfection, Moretz turns in her second tremendous performance of 2010 (this is world's away from the over-the-top, but terrific, Hit Girl).  And Smit-McPhee is a revelation as this role fits him to a tee.  The quiet interplay between the kids is fascinating, believable, and heart wrenching.<br /><br />There are still some good scares, however, for those that groan at the idea of a pre-teen love story.  Jenkins carries the bulk of the action as he finds likely victims.  One sequence, shot entirely from the interior of a moving car, is one of the most spectacular action set pieces of the year.  And a moment in the pool is wickedly effective for how little it shows.  In truth, I absolutely loved this film.  It balances the various elements with precision.  Moving and thoughtful, this isn't your run-of-the-mill vampire story!  About 4 1/2 stars, I'll round up for this actually being a successful remake of an already great film.

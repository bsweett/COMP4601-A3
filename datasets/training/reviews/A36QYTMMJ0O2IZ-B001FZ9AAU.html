I was excited when I heard that there was going to be an "Iron Man" movie, and even more thrilled when I saw the first trailer.  The movie more than lived up to the hype.  I mean, come on...who wouldn't dream of owning a powerful suit of red/gold armor like this?<br /><br />There are two big reasons why the movie is so well done.  First, there's Jon Favreau.  Favreau is a comic book fan.  I've said for a long time now, that you have to know the comic book character in order to do a good movie.  Richard Donner read Superman comics.  Nolan is a Batman fan.  Sam Raimi has been a Spider-Man fan since he was a kid.  Favreau knows the character of Tony Stark and Iron Man.  And Favreau pulls out all the stops to turn in one of the best superhero movies of all time.  I put this one up there with the two Batman movies, Superman: The Movie, and Spider-Man 2.<br /><br />The second big reason is Robert Downey Jr.  He makes Stark jump off the screen.  Downey Jr. gives Tony Stark all of the suaveness of the multi-billion dollar tycoon as well as his humanity.  Downey Jr. can deliver a line as good as any of the best actors out there.  He's always been that good.  It's a shame that his various "distractions" have prevented him from showing everyone how good he is...until now!  This is Downey Jr.'s "coming back" role.<br /><br />It seems Stark only cares about making money, no matter who it hurts.  And in this case, he's given a rude awakening when he finds out that his company, which manufactures weapons, is killing many people around the world.  It is at this point that he decides to put an end to the company, and Iron Man is created, initially to save his life, but also to help bring his own company down and destroy the weapons that he has created.<br /><br />Enter Obadiah Stane, wonderfully portrayed by Jeff Bridges.  He's Stark's second-in-command, and there's more going on within Stane's own agenda than meets the eye.  The last thing he wants is to see the company go under.  After all, helped get the company off the ground with Tony Stark's father.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow is perfectly cast as Stark's loyal secretary, Pepper Potts.  She seems to be the only one who sees that the change in Tony Stark goes beyond the damage to his heart.  For Pepper Potts, Tony Stark has finally found his heart.  Paltrow plays Pepper Potts without going over-the-top.  She seems to have an attraction for him, but something holds her back, and the scenes with Paltrow and Downey Jr. are very good.<br /><br />Finally, we have Terrence Howard as Stark's best friend, James "Rhodey" Rhodes.  While in the comic, Rhodes is a former pilot.  Here, he's an air force colonel with a lot of power within the military.  Howard does a decent job with Rhodes, and who can forget his great line as he's walking by the suit of Iron Man armor, "Next time!"  (If you aren't familiar with the comic, Rhodes takes over the mantle of Iron Man for a time and even eventually becomes "War Machine.")<br /><br />The special effects are absolutely brilliant.  Seeing Iron Man soaring through the skies with his boot jets is a treat.  He looks real slick in that suit of armor, and it's especially enjoyable seeing him go into action for the first time in his red and gold suit.<br /><br />The best superhero movies are those in which the focus is on the character, rather than the superhero.  Tony Stark is a character we like, and Robert Downey Jr. is the reason for bringing him to life on screen. And through Tony Stark, Iron Man works all the more when he's finally on screen.<br /><br />If there is one thing that I wished for the movie, it's that there was a longer climactic battle scene between Iron Man and Iron Monger.  I was also hoping that some of the battle would take place in the sky instead of entirely on the ground.  I wanted Favreau to really show what Iron Man can do.  But something like this is easily overlooked because the movie is so well done.<br /><br />Also, "Iron Man" is just plain fun!  It never takes itself too seriously, nor does it really tread into darker realms like some superhero movies.  But then, Iron Man isn't supposed to be a dark character.  Wearing bright red and gold armor, he represents a hero from way back when; when heroes were knights who wore armor and helped to defend those who couldn't defend themselves.  Stan Lee himself said that this was a big reason why he created a superhero who wears armor.<br /><br />I can't wait to see more of Iron Man and Robert Downey Jr. in "Iron Man 2."  I have a strange feeling that it will be even better than this one...and that's saying a lot.</p></body></html>

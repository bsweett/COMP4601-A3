A robot machine inspects a pile of rags. Goats roam in the streets. A wheel falls off a cart, a soldier dresses in protective gear to inspect the bomb. A man fingers a cell phone, the bomb explodes. A package is sealed for shipping. We see another patrol on the streets to check for a reported bomb. A car goes past the troops, then stops. The soldier disarms the fuse on the bomb. But there are six more! They are disarmed. Some soldiers play video games. Peddlers sell DVDs. Later there is another car to inspect. A shot causes a fire. "He's not going to make it." The truck is filled with 155mm shells. The wires are cut. He searches for the main fuse and cuts it. "873!"<br /><br />There is talk with an advisor. There's more drama at an explosion site. They find four armed men with an SUV in the desert. There is an ambush! A sniper hits soldiers from a distance. Can they reach him? A jammed magazine is cleared. They wait to aim again. One soldier spots an insurgent crawling along the bridge by the goats. They later relax with rough humor. The specialist collects souvenirs. The conversation reveals their past lives. [Does loneliness cause drinking?] The Colonel goes for a ride. They search an abandoned building. They find a load of explosives and a dead body. "What is he doing?" A bomb hits the Colonel! Could a DVD merchant be a spy for the insurgents?<br /><br />The specialist gets a ride to a house. Who was responsible for "Beckham"? He flees the house. James is summoned for a new mission. People flee from a "suicide bombing". Or was it a remote detonation? They search the alleys. A burst of gunfire is a warning. The soldier is rescued, but wounded. A man with bombs strapped to his body walks towards the American lines. Is it a trap? Can the harness be removed in time? "I hate this place." The year is over. Back home he visits a supermarket. Is this what he was fighting for? "The older you get the fewer things you really love." [Is that true?] Will he return for another tour of duty?<br /><br />This film is a pseudo-documentary with little drama in it. Does it have a lesson? Was it designed to straddle the line between pro-war and anti-war so an audience could read their own feelings into it? "War is a drug" is just nonsense. Wars are fought to exploit property and people. Whenever you read about conflict over some barren desert you can be sure there is mineral wealth involved. Those who are involved in combat (or other sports) can get an adrenaline high, but that is hardly a "drug".</p></body></html>

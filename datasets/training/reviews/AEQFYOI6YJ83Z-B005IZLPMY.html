In essence, he's the exact opposite of what Uncle Sam is looking for.  Yet Steve just can't wait to get over to Germany and kick some Nazi butt.  A scientist (an almost unrecognizable Stanley Tucci) admires Rogers's ambition, as well as his good heart, and enlists him in a special Army program, against the wishes of Colonel Phillips (a deadpan Tommy Lee Jones).  Rogers come out of the experiment stronger and smoother, and teams up with a feisty female (tough-as-hell Hayley Atwell), his best bud (super-suave Sebastian Stan), and scientist Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper doing a dead-on Robert Downey Jr.) to take on the evil Johann Schmidt (the always-sinister Hugo Weaving) and his cohort (Toby Jones.<br /><br />CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER has one solid thing going for it (no, not that god-awful title): its cast.  Everywhere is admirably cast, and while a few get underused (both Joneses, for example), and still others don't get much time to shine (Weaving is perfect when he's Schmidt, but as Red Skull, the special effects kind of get away from him), throughout these characters remain relatable and intriguing.  We genuinely root for Rogers, and though Captain America comes off as a bit of a d***** (rhymes with "whoosh"), that could be intentional.  Director Joe Johnston knows what he's doing, at least: crafting a middle-of-the-road superhero flick, something meant to tide us over until THE AVENGERS gets here (the set-up for the latter is actually interesting; not believable or original, but interesting).<br /><br />It seems I'm heaping a lot of criticism on the film.  Well, I am.  But note those 4 stars.  CAPTAIN AMERICA shouldn't be taken for anything more than it is.  It's not a great comic book film; merely a good one.  But hell, that's better than so many others out there.  If nothing else, it makes the 1940s look spectacular; kudos to Johnston for knowing how to make a period piece.  Watch this film if you're a fan of the comics, enjoy a good action/adventure yarn, or want to know all the pieces of the puzzle before seeing THE AVENGERS.  You won't be blown away, but you won't be bored, either.</p></body></html>

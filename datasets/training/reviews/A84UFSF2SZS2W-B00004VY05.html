<meta name="summary" content="SUPERFLUOUS"></head><body><p>At best, Milla Jovovich is cute here. Bruce Willis is doing what he does best... acting heroically in next to impossible circumstances. And Gary Oldman, well, we have all seen him in better performances as better villains virtually disappearing into his roles. He does not succeed in doing that here. The plot is not necessary to elaborate upon. It is superfluous. This film is not worth your time.</p></body></html>

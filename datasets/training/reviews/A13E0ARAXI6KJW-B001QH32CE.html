Fortunately, actress Adrienne Shelly shows a supple dexterity in balancing all the off-kilter elements since she wrote and directed the film. Sadly, this would also be her last film as she was murdered shortly before its debut at this year's Sundance Festival. I was previously not familiar with Shelly's work either before or behind the camera, but the uniquely fresh perspective on display here makes her loss as a filmmaking creative force feel all the more tragic.<br /><br />The plot concerns the travails of Jenna, a waitress at Joe's Pie Diner. Stuck in a loveless marriage to an abusive, childish man named Earl, she finds herself unhappily pregnant with his child and dreams of escaping her dreary life. Since her accumulated tip money is not nearly enough for her to leave, Jenna wants to enter a local pie-making contest with a grand prize of $25,000. At the diner, she shows a unique talent for creating unusual pies, and inspired by the events in her life, she makes and names a new one every day. Her best friends are the two other waitresses at the diner - sassy, breast-imbalanced Becky and vacuous, pasty-skinned Dawn, which makes the set-up feel like Martin Scorsese's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000286RO8">Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore</a> (or more accurately the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EU1QBS">sitcom</a> it spawned). There is even a character named old Joe, the bromide-spouting owner of the diner dispensing nuggets of unsolicited advice to Jenna. Further complicating matters is the town's new gynecologist, the befuddled and sensitive Dr. Pomatter, and what happens after he and Jenna meet becomes inevitable.<br /><br />The story doesn't take many surprising turns, especially when it is clear from the outset that we are following Jenna's bumptious journey toward self-fulfillment. However, what Shelly does extremely well is add her own sense of local color and realistic character development to the potentially clich&eacute;-ridden situation. The result is often funny, sometimes poignant and at certain points, intentionally absurd. With her porcelain doll looks and previously passive demeanor, Keri Russell would seem like a shallow choice to play Jenna, but she surprises by giving a fully dimensional and affecting performance. Her best scenes are early on as her quietly desperate situation is being established. The other actors provide solid support. Nathan Fillion provides a nicely disheveled charm to the smitten Pomatter, although his character is developed more as a fantasy figure. More interesting is Jeremy Sisto as Earl, who is at turns, dangerous and pathetically needy. Sisto plays him with such simmering menace that it's hard to believe the actor played Jesus in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1573629235">1999 miniseries</a> (featuring Debra Messing as Mary Magdalene!).<br /><br />Playing the saucy "Flo"-type waitress, Cheryl Hines provides expert comic support as Becky, while Shelly herself plays Dawn with quirky, bespectacled vulnerability. As old Joe, Andy Griffith shows up periodically to comment on what's going on. The film's atmospheric elements are first-rate starting with Matthew Irving's cinematography (the brightly colored finale has a fairytale feeling thanks to his expert camerawork) and a clever soundtrack sweetened by a lullaby written by Andrew Hollander and Shelly. The 2007 DVD comes with a standard set of extras including an informative commentary track by Russell and producer Michael Roiff. The ten-minute making-of featurette, "This is How We Made Waitress Pie", is mainly a series of on-set clips and interviews that look directed toward a press junket. There is a brief memorial tribute of sorts to Shelly, though the treatment feels cursory and elusive given the graphic circumstances of her death. Rounding out the extras are a profile on Russell's approach to the role of Jenna and a more superficial featurette about everyone's favorite pies.</p></body></html>

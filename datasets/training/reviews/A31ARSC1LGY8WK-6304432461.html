<meta name="summary" content="A near-perfect action classic"></head><body><p>John MaClane (Bruce Willis) a cop from New York is meeting his estranged wife at her office christmas party in a high rise in LA. At the same time a group of terrorists/robbers is plotting to steal the bank bonds that are sitting in the company safe - and so McClane is plunged into a cat and mouse game, which will test all his resourcefulness...<br /><br />Even after all these years this is still a great action film. It is brilliantly directed by John McTiernan who utilises all the nooks and crannies of the building to create a real sense of cat and mouse. There is also plenty of warmth and humour in the story to help relieve the unrelenting tension.<br /><br />Like all good films Die Hard contains characters that we really care about. Like all good action films this is combined with spectacular action. The only thing that counts against it is that it goes on a bit long. Otherwise it is a near-perfect action film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Build Up - Disapointing Ending."></head><body><p>Colin Farrel portrays a smaller-then-he-thinks publicist in this 80 minute 'thriller'. Although I have given this film 2 stars, I will say that the first 40 minutes of Phone Booth were actually quite gripping up until even Kiefer Sutherland's voice acting started to annoy me. And what made the film even more of a time waster was its rather stupid ending, making the whole film pointless as it really is a poor excuse threatening to kill a guy to, in effect, 'teach him a lesson'. <p>Not that the acting was bad or charatcers annoying, its the screenplay that was poorly written, especially for Kiefer Sutherland. Attempting to make him out to be this psychopath, towards the end, you actually think it is in fact a comedian (a bad one at that) whose aquired a rifle and is having fun toying with this guy in a phone box.<p>For Colin Farrel fans, you may as well see this, but for those who hate anti-climax's, don't bother.</p></body></html>

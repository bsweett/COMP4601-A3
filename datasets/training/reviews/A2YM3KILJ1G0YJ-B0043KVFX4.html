<meta name="summary" content="Alice is no longer in Wonderland"></head><body><p>Having now gained ever-increasing psionic abilities, Alice (Milla Jovavich) roams the apocalyptic, desert wasteland created by the Umbrella Corporation (UC).  Survival, that's it.  Nomadic in nature, Alice must "stay off the grid" to avoid the genetic testing being done by UC, who wish to harvest Alice's genes (think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0AQ">The Matrix</a>) in order to domesticate the zombies who have taken over.<br /><br />Part <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305075379">Mad Max</a>, part McCarthy's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OV2GRE">The Road</a>, this version of Resident Evil is a bleak look at the final stage of humanity's end.  Despite the minimal philanthropic endeavors of the UC, there is nonetheless still a very evil feel about the corporation, particularly its head researcher Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen).  When Alice links up with a ragtag caravan of survivors from the Raccoon City incident whose intentions are set on Alaska, the plot is set.  Good versus evil, survivors versus zombies - with support from UC.<br /><br />The biggest problems I have with Resident Evil: Extinction - other than the fact that the zombie genre has been somewhat saturated recently - are the complete ineptitude of the UC and the ridiculous measures they used to protect their desert base.  First, the UC somehow can create these incredible underground fortresses, facilities so advanced they are unfathomable; manufacture the T-virus, a deadly infectious disease that has nearly eradicated humanity; and programmed a life-like, holographic image that can best deduce the options for humanity's survival; yet they can't find a single person, Alice, even though she is controllable via satellite?  Huh?  The other problem with this film is simply a major plot hole.  Numerous times throughout the depiction of the barren wasteland we are shown the top level of a facility (ostensibly the UC headquarters) that is nothing more than a few buildings surrounded by chain-link fences to keep the horde of zombies at bay.  Yet throughout the film we see the same zombies ripping cages and doors off of hinges.  Huh?<br /><br />Overall, however, the direction from Russell Mulcahy is crisp and David Johnson's cinematography is not necessarily unique, but nonetheless refreshing.  The writing from Paul W.S. Anderson is boring, loose, and predictable, but honestly, what else is expected from the third installment of a zombie flick?  The special effects, makeup, and action are the highlights of the film, as numerous supporting actors are nothing more than zombie fodder.  One of my favorite scenes - let's call it Hitchcock on steroids - displays all the merits of this film in one neatly wrapped package.  Overall a worthwhile effort, will be enjoyed by fans of horror or zombies.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></body></html>

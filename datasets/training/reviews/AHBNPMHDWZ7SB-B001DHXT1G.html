It seems to get better every time I watch it. I am a huge fan of the character, but Ang Lee's Hulk did not do him the justice he deserved, in my opinion. Besides the fact that it was kind of long and boring, I just felt like there wasn't anything of value in that movie to retain my interest. For this one, it really made me happy to see such a devoted team work to bring fans the movie they deserved. It also made me happy to see that it was more of a continuation of where Hulk (2003) left off in the South American jungle, rather than a standard reboot. Ed Norton is to this film, what Ryan Reynolds will be to the Deadpool spin-off. He actually cared about the character, and had previous knowledge of who Bruce Banner and the Hulk were. That is always better than an actor who has to play catch up before shooting begins. I love Ed Norton, so I hope he returns for a second, and makes an appearance in The Avengers. I know the studio had his script rewritten and pissed him off, but hopefully they will work all of that out. Another huge plus this movie had going for it was Tim Roth as the villain. He was fantastic in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. And say what you want about Planet of the Apes, but he was very convincing as Thade. Another thing I really like about The Incredible Hulk is how tightly edited it is. The cinematography is beatiful, and the editors did a great job at cutting the scenes together. I wish there was a little more film for them to edit though. Nevertheless, it had a consistent flow in the pacing.<br /><br />There was a fair amount of breathtaking action. My favorite action set piece is on the college campus, but the final fight was sick as well. The narrative is definitely the star of this one. It brings joy to my heart that writers are taking comic book movies more serious. I never felt like the story was getting off track, or boring. There's alot of things that I love about this movie, but there are definitely a few flaws. The biggest flaw would have to be Liv Tyler's phoned in performance. Is it just me, or is she overrated? Her performance in The Lord of the Rings was pretty good, but how hard was that role? Another problem I had was that there was not enough character development for the Hulk, himself. Sure Bruce Banner was well developed, but what about the Hulk? In the comics and cartoons he held full conversations, but in the live action movies he can only utter two or three words. It gives viewers the false impression that he is all smash and scream, with no real thought process, except to protect Betty. I also felt that there wasn't enough variety. To me the movie went by too quickly. Is that a bad thing? I don't know, but I like this movie alot. Especially because the character is special to me. Of course this movie is no Iron Man or Spider-man, but it was a nice addition to my library of comic book films. In the mean time, I will keep impatiently waiting for the next installment. Even if the studio pissed Ed Norton off, I still hope he can get over that before a sequel for this movie becomes obsolete. Actually a sequel will never become obsolete because I love the Hulk.<br /><br />Now for the BD's transfer. The Incredible Hulk has a just about pristine transfer. The picture was fantastic, albeit minorly flawed. There were not enough issues with the PQ for me to dock the transfer any points. The audio is perfection. Loud, bombastic, and it just abuses the Home Theatre. You want to wake your neighbors? Put on the scene where we see Bruce change into the not-so-jolly green giant for the first time. When he lets out the bellowing roar, my windows rattled. There's nothing else I can say about it. It's pure demo material. The Incredible Hulk stands alone as the only Blu-ray available in both a green Elite case and lenticular slipcover. The packaging is all a geek can dream of. I love it. The extras are very well done. I enjoyed the featurettes, but I really wish the "making of" was longer. Hey, a half hour is better than some half-assed little interview right? Also, I was disappointed that Ed Norton didn't take the time to input his opinions in the otherwise engaging and entertaining audio commentary.<br /><br />7.5/10</p></body></html>

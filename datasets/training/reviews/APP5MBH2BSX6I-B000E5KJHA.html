<meta name="summary" content="Burton/Depp/Elfman perfect for this project, but....."></head><body><p>I wanted to be original in this review and not talk about the classic Gene Wilder version, but I find it impossible.  Having been a big fan of that film, yet having not read the book, and being a huge fan of each member of the trio named in this review title, here are my thoughts on how this much-discussed project turned out.<br /><br />It's a very funny film, first of all.  There are a great number of hilarious moments, lots of laughing out loud for all ages.  And the moral that was clear in Wilder's version is clear again:  Wicked children suffer the consequences of their actions and hopefully learn and grow, while goodness is rewarded in one way or another.<br /><br />And for my money, the music is leaps and bounds better in this "rethink" version, with Elfman's score sounding more like his old Oingo Boingo sound than anything he's ever put on film.  Having been a Boingo fan myself for about a quarter century, that's saying something.  "The Candy Man" always seemed out of place to me, the only part of the Wilder film that had to be endured rather than enjoyed (other than the out-of-place super-sappy ending); Elfman has taken the lyrics that Roald Dahl wrote in his book and added his singular quirky pop-rock sensibility to them.<br /><br />This brings me to the Oompa Loompas.  Modern technology has made it possible to duplicate Deep Roy, a Kenyan actor of Indian heritage who has worked with Burton several times before, into 165 six-inch-high Oompa Loompas.  Instead of merely carbon-copying him, however, a la "Lord Of the Rings" and "Troy" battle scenes where a few dozen actors are duplicated into thousands, multiple takes were used to convincing effect as if we were really seeing many tiny Oompa Loompas instead of Xeroxed Deep Roys.  The result is as clever as anything Burton has ever put on film, a solid improvement over the little people in the earlier film.  Roy reportedly earned a cool million for his role(s), nice work if you can get it.<br /><br />But the heart of the comparison between the Depp Wonka and the Wilder Wonka is, of course, between Depp and Wilder.  While there's no doubt that Depp is a more versatile actor, Wilder's portrayal of the chocolatier is one of moviedom's greatest offbeat characters.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that Depp's interpretation has come out at the same time that Michael Jackson has been such a subject of fascination, as many have drawn parallels.  I think that in a few years audiences will see this without the Jackson comparisons and be much fairer in their assessment of Depp's work here.  Depp's Wonka is the personifcation of stunted development, single-minded antisocial obsession, and paranoid as well, without being nearly as creepy as some have stated.  I find him no creepier than Wilder's Wonka, and no scarier....in fact, less so.  He's a big kid whose genius has allowed him to not grow up, and whose childhood was really ugly.<br /><br />Thus we can see that there is a valid psychological comparison between Jackson and Depp's Wonka, but it's unfair and unwarranted to overdo this comparison; it's just a current popular culture touchstone with which some reviewers have pigeonholed Depp's version.  This will wear off over time.  Personally Depp's Wonka seems to me more like an immensely more harmless version of Malcolm McDowell's Alex from "A Clockwork Orange," at least visually; turn Alex's clothing style black and you have Depp as Wonka in "A Clockwork Chocolate."<br /><br />There is one criticism I can agree with.  The repeated flashbacks to Wonka's childhood, as the son of an obsessive dentist, are really distracting.  We spend the first half-hour of the film being told what a wondrous place Wonka's factory must be, being teased into wanting to see it ourselves, then once we get there we are constantly drawn back out to Wonka's childhood.  It's really unnecessary; more restraint in revealing Wonka's upbringing would have resulted in a smoother story and more satisfying experience.  One reason Burton went this way was that he could work with Christopher Lee in the role of Dr. Wonka.  Having been a huge fan of '50s and '60s horror films when he was young, this is big to Burton; see Vincent Price's role in "Edward Scissorhands" for a much more effective fulfillment of Burton's wishes to work with such actors.<br /><br />Ultimately "Charlie And the Chocolate Factory" is an improvement over the original in a couple of ways (special effects, which is no surprise due to technological advancements; the music; the ending; and, marginally, the acting talents of the children), is the equal of the original in some ways (the set decoration, the wonders of the factory, Charlie's love of family), but inferior in some ways (primarily the flashbacks).  I prefer the original, but this newer model is well deserving of a place on my list of 200 favorite films.</p></body></html>

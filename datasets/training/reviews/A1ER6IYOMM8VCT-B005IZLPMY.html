<meta name="summary" content="SOLID MARVEL OUTING WITH AN EXCELLENT THREE DISC EDITION!"></head><body><p>I never read the original Captain America comic from the 40's, but considering this is probably the first of at least one sequel for "Cap" I think the film was very well done. Chris Evans looks the part and I guess I will get over him having played the Human Torch in the two Fantastic Four film. It's a little light on "Cap" action, but the story is pretty easy to follow. Great FX and casting make this one a winner for Marvel fans and also gets us pumped for next summer's Avengers film, but purist may find flaws I didn't notice or care about.<br /><br />The three disc 3-D/Blu Ray/DVD combo has some interesting extras making of etc. and an excellent looking Blu Ray transfer.</p></body></html>

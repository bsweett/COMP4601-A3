<meta name="summary" content="Reynolds goes psycho in a not so good remake of the original stinkpot"></head><body><p>re-make of the not so great original has The Lutz Family, husband George Lutz played by Ryan Reynolds (Blade: Trinity, The Alarmist) and Mrs. Lutz played by Melissa George (Tv's Alias, Sugar & Spice). They move in and find out that there was a murder that happened in that house. Soon, things start to boil up as the man of the house, George Lutz hears voices to tell him to kill his family because they are demons. "House's dont kill people, people kill people." explains George. Mrs. Lutz thinks something array as she sees her husband is transforming into a monster. Not much fun really, just like the original with some pretty boring blood splattering moments though Reynolds is very convincing in his psycho-possessed performance and some pretty good direction. Also starring Philip Baker Hall (Boogie Nights, Magnolia) as the priest. Michael Bay Produced and he also did Texas Chainsaw Massacre which I have no clue why he produced that and this.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One Of The Funniest Comedies In Recent Years."></head><body><p>Lately, the comedy genre has been extremely hit or miss, but if there's one comedic actor whose films are able to churn out consistant laughs without relyng too heavily on gross out and gags and whose jokes carry actual wit and substance and behind them, it's Will Ferrell.<br /><br />In the funnyman's latest comedic venture, "Talladega Nights", Ferrell plays Ricky Bobby, a Southern NASCAR champion who, along with his best friend Cal Naughton, Jr. (John C. Reilly), perfectly embody the stereotypical Southern lifestyle. Southern rock loving, gun toting, fast food munching doofs. With several championships under his belt, plus a hot wife Carley (Leslie Bibb) and a loving family, Ricky has it all.<br /><br />However, Ricky's life is about to get rocky with the introduction of homosexual French racing champion Jean Girard (the incredibly talented Sacha Baron Cohen), who is intent on overthrowing Ricky Bobby as champion. Ricky is determined on keeping his title, but when an accident leads to Rikcy into a state of psychosomatic shock and parayisis. While recupertaing in the hospital, Cal runs off with his wife, which puts an end to their friendship. After a few more mishaps, Ricky decided to quit Nascar, so he takes his two kids and goes to live with his mother. While there, Ricky meets up with his long estranged father, who are still unable to reconnect after all these years.<br /><br />However, things start to take a turn for the better when Ricky's crewmember Susan (Amy Adams) urges Ricky to get back in the race, rekindling his spark (as well as causing him to fall head over heels for her).<br /><br />At this pint, the film becomes predictable (though the final showdown between Bobby and Girard is unexpected and hilarious), but that does not stop "Taladega Nights" from becoming one of the funniest moives in recent years. If you're in for a good laugh, check it out.</p></body></html>

This whole movie relies on special effects and questions rather than entertainment. Honestly, ask anyone at your school and they will tell you that this movie was retarded. <p>The problem is that the Matrix Revolutions decided on the movie path of, &quot;Confusing = Brilliance&quot;. This system which I will abbreviate as C=B is a common system that fails. Evangelion had to have a whole movie called &quot;End of Evangelion&quot; to please viewers who were conned into the C=B system. Matrix relies on confusing the viewer with a barrage of questions and such. Also, Reloaded had the architect. Did anyone take anything out of that? Was that the most unrelenting mumbo-jumbo crap you have ever heard? Be prepared for more as Revolutions serves up some of the most confusing crap that fails to be brilliant.<p>Let me go over this again. The effects are good. The action is somewhat okay at times because of this. The acting is crap though and the dialogue is cheesy. On top of that we have use of the C=B system. Avoid this movie as it will just insult you.</p></body></html>

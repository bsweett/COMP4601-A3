<meta name="summary" content="Excellent horror film"></head><body><p>Perhaps no author has had so much of his work translated onto the big screen as Stephen King.  And perhaps no author has had those movies turn out so differently - from great classics like "The Shining" on the one hand to bad classics like "Maximum Overdrive" on the other.  "1408" definitely falls onto the "Shining" half of the scales.<br /><br />"1408" is deliberately paced without dragging - a very difficult feat to accomplish.  Even harder to accomplish is making a movie interesting where a long stretch of it is one guy in a room.  It is a testament to John Cusack's acting skills and the director's ability that the times Cusack is in the room are not just interesting, but often gripping.  Lesser talents would have rendered this movie unwatchable.<br /><br />"1408" gives us some reason to care about Cusack such that we care about what he's going through.  And it builds horror through suspense, music and atmosphere, not buckets of blood (not that there's anything wrong with that).  This is old-school horror, not spam-in-a-cabin.  The ending was a bit of a letdown - both versions, even; but honestly, I don't know how you could have ended this movie any differently.<br /><br />If you like horror movies, John Cusack, and/or "The Shining," you will probably enjoy this.  It's at least worth a rent.</p></body></html>

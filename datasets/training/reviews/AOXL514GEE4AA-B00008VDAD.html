Apollo 13 was treated by America as just another "routine" space flight until Cpt. Lovell (Hanks) uttered those words. Crippled in space and running out of air the team at ground control race against time to bring them home. Ron Howard's love and care for this story shows in every frame. The acting by the supporting cast is superb! Ed Harris as Gene Kranz was a perfect casting call as was Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly. This is great movie and a tribute to American pride, know how and never say die attitude of the U.S. space program!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: A wonderful transfer of a 15 year old movie! The audio is excellent as well. All the special features are ported over from the collector's edition dvd. FINAL THOUGHTS: ABSOLUTELY UPGRADE!</p></body></html>

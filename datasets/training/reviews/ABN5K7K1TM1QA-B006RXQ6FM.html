The deeper doubt is that if he did, did he do anything wrong?  Or on an even deeper level, did the wrong that he did outweigh the good that he did?  This last question is at the very heart of the relationship between priests and boys in the near contemporary American society depicted in this film.<br /><br />Personally I don't believe that the ephemeral culture in which we live can answer that question.  Perhaps it is true that people like Father Flynn are compelled to do good in this world for just those boys who most need them because of their "nature" (as Meryl Streep's character Sister Aloysius puts it).  Science has a lot of trouble accounting for homosexuality, and understandably most scientists aren't interested in exploring why some men are sexually attracted to boys.  The truth from an evolutionary point of view must be that in some sense that attraction leads to, paradoxically, a better fit for not only the boy, which is obvious in some circumstances, but also for the man.  How can this be?  Most theories about homosexuality invoke male bonding as the evolutionary force that makes the behavior adaptive.  Homosexual males bond with other males (homosexual or not) and thereby increase their access to females.  So great is the advantage that accrues to such males that even the homosexual males (who mate only to have offspring) have an adaptive advantage over outsider males.<br /><br />But what is the adaptive advantage to males who are sexually attracted only to boys?<br /><br />In a way this film (and the direction by John Patrick Shanley based on his play) actually addresses this question.  The answer comes from the scene in which Sister Aloysius and the boy's mother (Viola Davis as Mrs. Miller) talk and walk.  The mother clearly sees that whether her boy is getting molested by the priest or not is secondary to the fact that the priest cares about him more than his father.  In other words (and most specifically in other circumstances) the priest would become the ally of the mother and they would bond.  In a world far removed from ours, in the prehistory, they might become as one.  Or in a world removed from the celibacy of the priesthood he would love the boy and the mother and she would love him and sex would happen, although perhaps not as frequently as it would if the man were heterosexual.  Certainly he is a better man for the boy and for any further boys than a father who would beat his son.<br /><br />Meryl Streep who has given us so many brilliant performances gives yet another one here.  And Hoffman ditto.  I have said it before and I'll repeat it, Meryl Streep is nearly flawless in everything she does.  Philip Seymour Hoffman ditto.  To see two of the greatest actors of our time in the same film is quite a treat.  To give them such indelible characters to work with and such a compelling story to act out is really wonderful.  And I must say that Amy Adams who played Sister James was also excellent and was not noticeably overshadowed by Streep and Hoffman.  Viola Davis who played the one scene as the boy's mother was also excellent.<br /><br />The movie starts slowly as in a play, which it is. This is allowable since the play-going audience has an investment and won't get up even if the first act goes slowly.  After a few minutes the story picks up and gathers power until, with a not entirely discernable suddenness, we are enthralled.  In the end we realize how quickly the story was actually told.<br /><br />Do not give up on this after the first ten or fifteen minutes.  It is a story about an issue for our times not to be missed, told with dignity and compassion for all concerned, and with a deep appreciation for the subtleties and paradoxes of human nature and the complexities of our world.</p></body></html>

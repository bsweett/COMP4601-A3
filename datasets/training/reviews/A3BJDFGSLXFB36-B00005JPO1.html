<meta name="summary" content="Where else could we have gone?"></head><body><p>I have been a life-long fan of the Indiana Jones films (I first saw "Raiders" when I was ten).<br /><br />I really don't understand all the negative reviews heaped upon this flick. So many people balked at the "aliens" factor, but they seem to forget that the Indy movies (as well as the novels) always dealt with the occult and/or supernatural. Where else could the Indy saga go? How could the creators take it one step further? Well, how about the mystery of the so-called Roswell incident?<br /><br />I thought the aliens mystery was the next logical step for Indy to try and tackle. Why not? When you consider the "ancient astronauts" theories that have been circulating for the past 40 years or so and how these theories tie in with archeology around the world, I found the latest Indy premise to make sense and found it interesting and exciting.<br /><br />Another bone of contention seems to be the now-infamous "nuke the fridge" scene. Why do so many people have a problem with this? No one seemed to scream and holler when, in "Temple of Doom" during the mine car chase scene, the car that Indy and company were racing around in managed to jump a 100 foot gap in the track and still land safely and accurately on the other side just because they "ducked"?<br /><br />That's what Indiana Jones films have always been about; escaping the inescapable. The original 3 films all had certain scenes that were kind of hard to swallow, but so what? It's an action/adventure film! You've got to suspend disbelief for the sake of a good story!<br /><br />I found "Kingdom" to be everything that an Indy film should be; a great leading man, plenty of action, a healthy dose of comedy, exciting chases, great fight scenes and a terrific mystery to unravel. What else do you look for in an Indiana Jones film? "Kingdom" delivers all of that.<br /><br />It's not my favorite Indy movie (that distinction is awarded to "Last Crusade" with "Raiders" only a hair's length behind it), but it IS an Indiana Jones film! My wife and I both thoroughly enjoyed it and were glad to own it on DVD. I loved being able to share it with my kids who, since "Kingdom"'s release, have shown a tremendous interest in the original 3 films as well (which we have all watched an enjoyed together).<br /><br />I especially loved the scene where the Russians' car crashes into the statue of Marcus Brody in the courtyard of Marshall College and the statue's head breaks off only to crash right into a Ruskie's stomach effectively removing him from the chase. What a wonderful, nostalgic touch and a wonderful homage to the late Denholm Elliot.<br /><br />Relax and enjoy this movie. It's not meant to be anything more than it's predecessor films; high adventure escapism!<br /><br />"It's not the years, honey. It's the mileage."</p></body></html>

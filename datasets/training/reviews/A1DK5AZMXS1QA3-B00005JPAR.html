<meta name="summary" content="Weird journeys"></head><body><p>One recurring theme for manifests itself annually in Hollywood is the movie about lovers transcending death and time to be with each other.  Past examples include Somewhere in Time, The Lake House, Timeline, Bicentennial Man, and maybe even the Sixth Sense.  This is probably the weirdest of them all, but also the most intriguing.  The movie is actually three stories wrapped into one, all of which feature three characters, Hugh Jackman, Rachel Weisz, and a tree that gives life.  The three are intertwined and revolve around a man, played by Hugh Jackman, trying to save his lover, played by Rachel Weisz, using the power of a tree.  All are OK stories in and of themselves, but meshed together the whole is more than the sum of the parts.  The same music theme is used for all three stories, which is unfortunate and repetitive.  Both Jackman and Weisz act well, and the story is interesting enough.  It just jumps a little too much, and the story that takes part in the future is not fleshed out that well.  The title of the movie refers to a book being written by Weisz's character, and my guess is that it refers to the Fountain of Youth.</p></body></html>

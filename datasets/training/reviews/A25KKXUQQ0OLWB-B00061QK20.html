The use of color and imagery is amazing.  I'm not sure how many Americans realize that the old Technicolor movie cameras found their way to China allowing some its greatest directors to make use of the best and most stable color movie process around.  I'm sure it was an honor for Jet Li, Tony Leueng and Maggie Cheung to make a movie with him and such a wonderful movie too.  The story is told beautifully and movingly.</p></body></html>

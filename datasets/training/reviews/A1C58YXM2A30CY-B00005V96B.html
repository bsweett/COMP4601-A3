<meta name="summary" content="'Monsters' Is a Scream!"></head><body><p>Monsters Inc. is a delightfully funny film by Pixar and Disney.  Released in 2001, Monsters, Inc. reflects the modern human world in many ways, with production quotas, rolling blackouts, and families and children in bustling Monsteropolis.<br /><br />Almost an Abbott and Costello film, Sully & his assistant and best friend, Mike Wazowski.  Randall is Sully's greatest competitor, a scaly, evil chameleon with greed at his heart.<br /><br />Sully does the scaring of children through doors that when connected to children's bedroom closets become a doorway into the human dimension.  Energy is collected from the screams and powers the Monsteropolis.<br /><br />But kids are not getting as scared as they used to.  To increase the quota, there is corruption and intrigue afoot, which is realistic for an animated film.<br /><br />The adult gags and references, such as Harryhausen's Restaurant, are fun to see.  Also, with children being seen as a threat to Monster-dom, there are great penalties for even the slightest contamination from the child's world.  A sock on one unlucky monster's back is enough for panic by the yellow squad of the CDA: Child Detection Agency.<br /><br />The animators and writers made Randall the complete opposite of Sully.  Where Sully is kind, intelligent and gentle, Randall is sly, secretive and evil.  Randall will stop at nothing to get his own ends.<br /><br />The one-eyed Mike is fun to watch and see how the animators give a one-eyed guy such emotion.  He's pretty silly too where he just doesn't get what people are trying to say to him.<br /><br />Crime does not pay and making lemonade out of lemons are good lessons for kids.<br /><br />The "blooper" reel at the end is great, and the jazz music is well done.<br /><br />Great entertainment from Disney.<br /><br />The voice actors include:<br /><br />John Goodman<br />Billy Crystal<br />Mary Gibbs<br />Steve Buscemi<br />James Coburn<br />Jennifer Tilly<br /><br />Other Pixar Films:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030IIYWA">Toy Story (Two-Disc Special Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo w/ Blu-ray Packaging)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EOQWF8">Wall-E (Two-Disc and BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>]<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNS0">Cars (Widescreen Edition)</a></p></body></html>

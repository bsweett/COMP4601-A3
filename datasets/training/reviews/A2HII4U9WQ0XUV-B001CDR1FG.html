What should have been a fatal exposure combines with certain---erm, genetic irregularities---to create some major anger management problems for Dr. Banner.<br /><br />You see, every time he gets angry---really angry---he turns into a big green man. A big green man with expandable purple stretch pants that assist with his modesty during his transformations from Eric Bana into a completely CGI-generated bright green monster.<br /><br />A big green man that hurls tanks and helicopters about like they were toys. A big green man whose erstwhile captor, General Ross (played competently but shallowly by Sam Elliot), decides to let escape from an underground Area 51-esque base, the better to 'fight him outside.'<br /><br />Umm, OK. The truth is that Ang Lee brings his stellar cinematic sensibilities (from movies like "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "Sense and Sensibility") to Marvel's storied Incredible Hulk: like the little nanites that flow through Bruce's body and the gamma rays, the marriage of Lee to the comic book material results in a whole that is greater---and greener---than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />'Hulk' is solidly entertaining, visually gorgeous, and---especially for a summer blockbuster---an unusually experimental film that manages to entertain and startle simultaneously.<br /><br />Those who go to "Hulk" looking for stellar special effects will leave highly satisfied. SEE:<br /><br />*green gamma-ray mushroom clouds!<br /><br />*nasty insane killer giant poodles!<br /><br />*Banner's mad scientist father David, who undergoes some startling transformations of his own (seriously: Nolte doesn't just *chew* scenery in this movie, he absorbs it!)!<br /><br />*the incredible battle sequences between the Hulk and his tormentors---be they the hideous hulk-Dogs or our brave boys in the US Army---the latter pitted against the real "Army of One"!<br /><br />The special effects centerpiece award of "Hulk" goes, of course, to the eponymous hero: the Hulk himself is completely computer generated. Does it work?<br /><br />Actually, the Hulk is one of the superhero pandemic's most sympathetic characters, and displays far more humanity than his alter ego, played with considerable reticence by Eric Bana. The last superhero we saw who was this withdrawn was Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne.<br /><br />The acting here is all top-notch, and there aren't any uneven performances: Bana doesn't exactly reprise his "Chopper" performance---he's way too restrained---but then again, he's a nice counterpoint to his lab-destroying Green Inner Child. Jennifer Connelly re-affirms her position as Hollywood's most gorgeous underrated actress. Nick Nolte plays his leering, rasping role to the hilt, and ultimately steals the show.<br /><br />There are times where the movie gets a little too awkward and goofy for its own good: I'd still love to know where the Hulk gets his one-size-fits-all purple stretch pants. There's Josh Lucas's death scene, in which they freeze frame the horrified Lucas in front of an explosion---highly goofy, but very comic booky, and it works; I laughed, anyway.<br /><br />The Hulk's surrender scene in downtown San Francisco also makes little sense; after all, if the Big Green Guy is so fond of leaping, why doesn't he just leap out of the way of all those army men and hop over to Oakland?<br /><br />And speaking of that, what was General Ross thinking when he figures that it's a good idea to let the leap-loving Hulk escape the underground base, reasoning that it will be easier to fight the Big Guy on the surface? Time for a court-martial, Soldier.<br /><br />But even though the buildup and exposition of "Hulk" makes the movie run a tad long, the film ultimately comes together, a testament to the solidity of its actors, the seamlessness of its CGI, and the talents of both Ang Lee and Director of Photography Fred Elmes, who worked with Lee on "Ice Storm" and has been a long-time DP for David Lynch (his credits include "Eraserhead", "Wild at Heart", and "Blue Velvet")---so it's no wonder that such lurid, dark emotions can be shot on such a visually brilliant palette.<br /><br />Yes, "Hulk" is a Evil Dad vs. Good Son movie---and like so many other films that used the same device to telling effect (think Star Wars, or even, in a lopsided way, Spider-Man), "Hulk" succeeds at a very primal level.<br /><br />"Hulk", after all, is about secrets repressed under a banal, nondescript surface, about the rage that lurks within all of us. Ang Lee's "Hulk" says that if it isn't easy being Green, at least it looks good. Just don't make him angry---you wouldn't like him when he's angry.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

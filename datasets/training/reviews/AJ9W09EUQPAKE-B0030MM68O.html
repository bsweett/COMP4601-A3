<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant portrayal of the psychology of men in combat"></head><body><p>This film avoids the trap of making glib political statements about the Iraq war (it is surely too recent history to know its full significance yet). Instead it focuses on the daily lives of a taught squadron of bomb disposal experts who patrol the dusty Baghdad streets and dry desert scapes searching for and diffusing the ramshackle bombs put in place by insurgents trying to sabbotage the US reconstruction efforts.<br /><br />The drama weaves closely into the lives of the men, dominated by Sargeant William James, a curiously eager soldier who recklessly seeks out dangerous bomb situations, often failing to heed the warnings of his colleagues.<br /><br />The plot is taught, not in a synthetic Hollywood way with tension artificially built in leading to some carefully contrived denoument, but in a realistic, frustrating flatlining way. The days tick down to the end of the bomb squad's tour of duty, and the heat, relentless opposition from guerilla insurgents and cruelty (in one memorable scene, insurgents use the corpse of a small boy to conceal explosives) all take their toll on the men. They quarrel, gossip, banter and fight. The narrative in a way flatlines, replicating the true situation in Iraq where it was (still is) very difficult to tell what sort of impact and progress is being made.<br /><br />But the comradeship between the men is real, and this is developed in the film through touching scenes, such as James supplying an exhausted colleague (and rival) with water after he has been staring out at insurgents in the desert heat for hours.<br /><br />Realistic cinematography, with a good mix of panoramic shots and action close ups. It is a skilled, intelligent and moving film. well deserving of its accolades. The final twist is not gimmicky, but rather reflects the addictive effect that war has on some people, providing a tension and purpose that far suppasses anything in ordinary suburban life.<br /><br />Well done to everyone involved in the making of this film.</p></body></html>

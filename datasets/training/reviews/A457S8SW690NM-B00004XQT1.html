<meta name="summary" content="An awesome movie"></head><body><p>I'm frustrated about giving this movie 4 stars and not 5 stars but because of the random and disgusting sex scenes, it got punched down to 4. Besides that, the movie is great. I was expecting a solid movie and it blew away my expectations. Oh, and by the way, I didn't see the unrated version but saw the original theatrical version. After watching the theatrical trailer, I thought that it would be very horrifying and disturbing. But, on the contrary, my friend! The movie is absolutely hilarious! The way that it is made makes it such that you'll laugh instead of being horrified. The gruesome deaths are made in a way that they're actually really funny. Here are some funn moments:<br /><br />1. Patrick Bateman goes to get his sheets washed at a company but gets mad when they say that they can't get out the red stain on them. He claims that it's juice, cran apple. But, of course it isn't.<br /><br />2. Patrick puts newspaper all around a place where a guy's sitting at his house. And then puts on a rain coat. I wonder why.<br /><br />The movie is about Patrick Bateman, a rich Wall Street man who's obsessed with killing people. From bums to friends that he doesn't like to random women.<br /><br />The movie isn't disturbing because the violence is made in such a comic matter that you laugh out loud, and then maybe feel guilty. But, boy, it's funny. The movie is very exciting and interesting and keeps you into it until its great ending. I loved the ending and found it to be very unpredictable but makes sense. And the comic violence made sense to me now. I recommend this awesome movie and Christian Bale's perfromance is stunning. No one else could have done. Call me crazy, but I would have given him an oscar. He deserved it.<br /><br />And for parents nervous for their children that want to see it, I feel that 13 years + are good ages or mature children. The movie doesn't have a lot of cuss words but has some and the violence isn't really shown. You see the blood on Bateman's face and a body in the background but it's made comically. But, the random sex scenes are perverted so I recommend just closing your eyes. That's what I did.<br /><br />This is a worthy rent and even a worthy buy. Too bad for the sex scenes, or else it definitely deserved 5 stars.</p></body></html>

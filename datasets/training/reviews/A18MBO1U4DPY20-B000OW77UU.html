<meta name="summary" content="RUN, WILL SMITH, RUN"></head><body><p>Every time Will Smith ran in this film, I'd hear a part of me cheer him. I doubt he can act any better. Let's save ourselves sometime and give him at least an Oscar Nomination for this film called Pursuit of Happyness. Now, you may wonder what is about this film that's worth liking. Mere words (or my words) can't explain but I'll try.<br /><br />Chris Gardener(Will Smith) is a man who's wife has left him. He has no income and lives on selling some machine. He has one son who's five years old. He runs around to find a job vacancy or to sell his machine. Sometimes he runs from the taxi driver while at other time he runs behinds hippies and crazy folks. There is much more but I'll let that be.<br /><br />Queer intrigue attaches itself it's self to Will Smith in this film. Everything about him makes you want to cheer him on. I relate to Will Smith. His fears, troubles, tears, smiles, gestures and shoes become yours by the end of the first hour.<br /><br />Don't miss this film. I'm not gonna call it life affirming. All I can say about this movie is Will Smith, Will Smith and Will Smith.<br /><br />Respect is no longer earned. It is snatched.</p></body></html>

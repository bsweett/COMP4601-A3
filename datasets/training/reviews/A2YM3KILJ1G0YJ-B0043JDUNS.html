<meta name="summary" content="Boyhood fantasies and comic book fans' wishes fulfilled"></head><body><p>When I was a young boy I played with all sorts of action figures, GI Joes and Transformers the most.  Later as a young teen I got my first job at a comic book store.  What I often thought of was a collaboration of my favorites.  As Hollywood has slowly embraced a genre specifically steered towards the Comic-Con crowd I have looked on with great interest.  Having loved the original Iron Man, I can say unequivocally that Iron Man 2 is awesome in every way.<br /><br />The sequel deals quite a bit with the palladium and arc reactor technology behind Iron Man, and how that technology adversely affects Tony Stark (Downey, Jr.).  As the U.S. government, via LTC James Rhodes (Cheadle) demands access to the design, use, and replication of Iron Man's scientific advancements - something Stark refuses - the man behind the mask must face not only his government and his mortality, but also a competing industrialist, the nefarious Justin Hammer (Rockwell), and the Russian villain Ivan "Whiplash" Vanko (Rourke), who has reverse engineered Iron Man's arc reactor technology (adding weapons along the way) to satisfy a family vendetta.  On top of all that Stark still has to be the hard-partying, scotch-pounding womanizer who must placate Pepper Potts (Paltrow) on a daily basis, ogle new assistant Natasha Romanoff (Johansson), and contemplate an affiliation with SHIELD - a top secret government organization led by front-man Nick Fury (Jackson).<br /><br />Some may say this movie fails because it lacks action.  And by "lacks action" most people mean "isn't Transformers 2."  In my opinion, the more detailed storyline uncovering Stark's personal, psychological, and physical dilemmas is the essence of the flawed superhero, and avoiding the zeitgeist makes is superior to the bam, pow FX-heavy of Transformers 2, et al.  But when Iron Man 2 DID ratchet up the action - initially with a battle between Iron Man and Rhodes, but later in an epic Iron Man robot battle royal - it was edge the seat, floor rumbling, front row of the rollercoaster exciting.<br /><br />It should go without saying, but the incredible cast performs just as one would expect.  Downey, Jr. is the boisterous, swaggering Tony Stark personified, and Paltrow, whose smug attitude I typically loathe, is nearly perfect as Potts.  Rockwell and Jackson turn in inspired, albeit secondary efforts.  Johannson is minimally used, but serves her Matrix-esque purpose in a skin-tight outfit and awesome fight scene.  The scene stealer, however, is clearly Mickey Rourke.  The demented, evil look, the spot-on accent, the eccentricity is electric (pun intended).<br /><br />Great movie, succeeds where others have failed, builds upon the story perfectly, provides something for all audiences, and for me, it put the GI Joe into a Transformer costume.</p></body></html>

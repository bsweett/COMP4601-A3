<meta name="summary" content="Better than expected, decent action and storyline."></head><body><p>Well, I thought this movie was going to be a rip off of various other sci-fi thrillers about the future, and it wasn't totally. Taking place in the not to distant future, Ewan Mcgregor and Scarlett Johannsen are two people living in a "colony" after the earth had a big contamination that just about killed everything.  Their goal in life, to win the colonies lottery and go to the Island, the only part of earth that supposidly was left to repopulate.  Well, after making friends with a colony worker (steve bushemi, Ewan mcgregor begins to question exactly what is outside the colony.  He discovers the whole thing is a scam, and he take Scarlett and escapes, and the chaise is on.  I won't fill in any more details, but it's worth a rental at least, but consider bying it. It got decent action and a fair story.</p></body></html>

CLEAN EM UP"></head><body><p>I was fortunate to see this on the big screen and have to say it is not only one of my fav.Stallone films but one of my fav.films for all time.  We all know the story of Rambo so I just want to point out why this film is so classic.  The script and music are superb and even the supporting actors have great lines(BUT WILL!!  I HAVE TO BE AT THE DRUG STORE TOMORROW MORNING) Stallone has oh I'd say 30 lines of dialog in the whole movie<br />and yet it is one of his best.  Action stars like Stallone don't need dialog<br />they just need to kick butt and that is what this movie does.<br /><br />RAMBO:Is there someplace to eat around here?<br />WILL:There is a diner 15 miles down the road.<br />RAMBO:Is there something wrong with me eating here?<br />WILL:Yeah me.<br />RAMBO:Why you pushing me?<br />WILL:--"WHAT?!"<br />RAMBO:Why you pushing me I did nothing to you.<br /><br />DEPUTY:Rambo...John J.  Your going to talk to me.  I SWEAR TO GOD YOUR GOING TO TALK TO ME SOLDIER!  I'm beginning to dislike you(puts billy club underneath Rambo's chin) A LOT!!!<br /><br />WILL:This guy comes walking in with all this good advice about how we can<br />save our skins.  Well we saved our skins colonel and the best man lost..AND HE DOESN'T LIKE IT!!!<br /><br />WILL:C'mon Steve put the magazine away will ya.<br /><br />EVERYONE IN WOODS:  WIIIIIIILLL  OH! GOD WIIIIIILL!!!!!!!!!</p></body></html>

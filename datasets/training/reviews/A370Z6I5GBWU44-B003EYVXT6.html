<meta name="summary" content="Started out great, but..."></head><body><p>Well. I had high hopes for this film, and it started off with a lot of promise. But it turned out to be less of a sci fi film and more of a thriller with several badly-executed plot twists.<br /><br />I must warn you though, my review contains spoilers, so do not read if you don't want to be spoiled, though I personally think you might be better off if you do actually read, because this movie was hard to take seriously and was a waste of my time. Okay? You have been warned. So anyway the movie starts off great. You got two cute, nerdy scientists (the whole lab doesn't look that professional, this is not a huge lab with white-blue lights and everything. This lab seems to be more underground, and everyone dresses like hippies/hobos/emos under their lab coats, so I'm guessing they're not that well-paid despite the importance of their splicing work.<br /><br />It seems impossible that no one in the lab would find out about the experiment, but I guess it really is an underground lab with less supervision. However, it remains implausible.<br /><br />Dren's growth is inconsistent and this movie does not focus much on her growth except for a couple of 'miracles' like breathing underwater or learning how to spell. But she does not speak, even though she displayed that ability at the end of the movie. Then she gets smuggled out, and I'm thinking that 'Dad' was right to have wanted to destroy the experiment in the first place even though he changed his mind later.<br /><br />Actions and reactions make no sense. Dren's intelligence and learning growth remain inconsistent as if the writers didn't care about it. Later it is revealed that Dren has Elsa's DNA. How is that possible when the ova donated was a Jane Doe? Unless she got one out of herself, but whatever. When Elsa takes the cat away, there is no logic behind this, as Dren was just fine and comfortable with the cat and was obviously not sick. Dren obviously mourns for the cat, but she just sits there with her arms stretched out rather than grabbing the cat back or fighting for it. When Elsa returns the cat, Dren kills it with her tail. This makes no sense.<br /><br />What Dren did with Dad... I TOTALLY saw this coming ever since little Dren saw Mommy and Daddy together that one night. So it was absolutely no surprise.<br /><br />I don't know what the heck was up with Fred and Ginger. I mean, bam, Ginger changing and then the two of them fighting and having enough strength to actually unscrew the bolt to their cage? Really? Are you serious?<br /><br />And then just when you think it can't get any more ridiculous, Dren 'evolves' AGAIN and this time she... er, he does to Mom what he-she did to Dad. I was stunned at this horrible plot twist. The scene added NOTHING to the story. And then bam, at the end of the movie, you probably guessed what happened to Mom before they showed her stomach. And then going back to the research facility and just... the ending was horrible. It's astonishing that a movie with so much promise turned out to be so disappointing.</p></body></html>

While it's not as awful as the likes of say, the Fantastic 4 films or what not, it still sucks and reminds me why I hated super hero films for the longest time up until last year. Worse yet, this film had potential to be great but instead ends up being a miserable flop.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The story focuses on a man named Johnny Blaze; played by Nicholas Cage; a professional stuntman specializing in dirt bikes. After the death of his father during stunt, Johnny runs away and ends up meeting Satan himself who makes him become the Ghost Rider and stop evil forces and punish people for their sins. The rest of the story focuses on Johnny's love life and having to stop four villains possessing the powers of nature and one of them is Satan's own son.<br />MUSIC: Generally consists of rock as well as a usual musical score you'd expect, but it's not in a good way.<br />ACTION: These scenes were a mix between somewhat interesting to utter joke. The stunts involving the bike and the CGI effects were cool, but what's up with the fact these villains are so wimpy? The fight scenes with the villains end far too quickly and crappily scripted to the point of laughably bad and utterly inept. The action scenes overall are not good.<br />ACTING: Nicholas Cage, can you not get a good role in anything anymore (Wicker Man was hated by critics and moviegoers, Bangkok Dangerous; same case, Next, etc.)? The dialogue was awful, and so was the acting. The actors did not seem to know how to work with the script and their performances were really bad.<br />OVERALL: Do not watch. It's not the worst super hero film ever, but it still sucks. It's painful to see Nicholas Cage stoop this low especially because he's starred in good films like the National Treasure flicks and Face Off. I also doubt this film caught the feel of the Marvel character for the most part as well.<br />THE GOOD: The CGI effects and some of the cool stunts.<br />THE BAD: The action scenes, the acting, the storyline, and the music.</p></body></html>

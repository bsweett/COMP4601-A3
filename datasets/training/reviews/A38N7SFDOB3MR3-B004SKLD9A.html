<meta name="summary" content="A Captivating Story. 45 out of 100."></head><body><p>Before reading the reviews regarding Equilibrium on Amazon, I had never heard of the film. I was looking for some quality science fiction movies, with higher ratings, that I had yet to watch. After reading about Equilibium, I decided to rent it.<br /><br />To be honest, I didn't expect much. I wasn't familiar with the actors, and I am always leary about movies that feature alot of action scenes. With that said, Equilibruim exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />It is the story of a "future cop" who is at the top of his game. The twist? Feelings are not allowed. World War III has turned mankind into haters of all things artistic and expressive, and even things as laughter or grief will bring about the death penalty. This "cop" has the job of moping up the criminals; those who express feelings, or possess such forbidden objects as books, music,paintings, etc.<br /><br />While the movie does have some awesome actions scenes, it also has captivating characters, above average acting, quality directing and a good story. There are many bad action movies on the market, but Equilibrium will not disappoint. It is sci-fi/future/martial arts/action will a unique story twist.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 45<br /><br />25 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br />5 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br />5 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?<br />6 (out of 10).

Is this movie worth seeing/renting?<br />0 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?</p></body></html>

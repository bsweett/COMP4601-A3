<meta name="summary" content="best Star Trek movie they ever made"></head><body><p>In fact, one of the best SF movies they've ever made.<br /><br />Very few people are fans equally of Star Trek and Star Wars.  You may like both, but at some point you prefer one over the other.  This is movie is so good that, if you're one of the Star Wars partisans, you'll consider converting.<br /><br />Brilliant pacing, brilliant script, brilliant villain, brilliant ending.  I love to complain about movies but am drawing a blank on this one:  what's not to like?<br /><br />As just one example of how good the script is:  the movie starts off with the vaunted Admiral Kirk effin' up.  And it's a royal f-up, too.  You just wanna smack him, but that's what makes the script so excellent.  If he had put those shields up as per Starfleet regulations, he would have been boring and predictable, like Aeneas.  As it is, he's human and believable, and that failing draws you into the film.  Definitely the best moment in a movie filled with great moments:  when Kirk fails to say "shields up".<br /><br />Wish all these Star Trek films were as good.</p></body></html>

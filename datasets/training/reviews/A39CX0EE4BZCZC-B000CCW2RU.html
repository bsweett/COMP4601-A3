The clones' purpose is to provide their human counterparts replacements for defective body parts. (Boy, I could use a few!)<br /><br />The only problem is that one of the clones (Ewan McGregor) starts to become human with feelings and emotions all his own. He is then joined by a female clone (Scarlett Johansson) and the two them try to escape their surroundings - a prison-like laboratory in the middle of the desert.<br /><br />The last half of the film is them on the run, trying to tell someone the truth.<br /><br />This turned out to be an Arnold Schwarzenegger-type action movie, which isn't all bad because Arnold's films were at least entertaining. It features the same stuff: outrageous scenes in which incredible things happen to the heroes....like assassins shooting at them from 30 feet away and never hitting them or falling from tall buildings....and never getting hurt! These two leads have nothing on Superman!  They are indestructible, apparently. It's lunacy....but it certainly has it's fun moments with some tremendous stunt work.<br /><br />To me, the best aspect of this film was the stylish camera-work. There are some really, really nice visuals in this presentation, and good sound. A good Blu-Ray disc of this movie would look and sound awesome. I see one is out, but it's unavailable for sale. I wonder what's up with that?</p></body></html>

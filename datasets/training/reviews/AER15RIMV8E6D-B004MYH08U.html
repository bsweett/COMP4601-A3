This movie has a lot of action, comedy, and explosions! Seth Rogen stars as Britt Reid, a slacker son of the publisher of The Daily Sentinel. When his father dies, Britt fires the staff, except for Kato, who makes his coffee. Britt and Kato become friends and decide to cut the head of his dad's memorial statue. During this, they save a couple from a gang. They decide to become masked crimefighters and pose as villians. He decides to call himself 'The Green Hornet' They soon must deal with a Russian gangster named Chudnofsky. If you love action and comedy, you'll love THE GREEN HORNET!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="W. and The Two Theories."></head><body><p>_W._ (2008) starring Josh Brolin is yet another of Oliver Stone's films detailing the lives and presidencies of the American presidents.  W. of course is a examination of the presidency of George W. Bush.  It details his life and early career, beginning with his induction into the ultra-secret Skull and Bones society at Yale, his involvement in various jobs and his attempts to run a major league baseball team.  The film shows Dubya as largely constantly under the influence of his father who he constantly tried to escape.  The film also shows Dubya's struggles with alcoholism, drugs, and women and his eventual conversion and rise to power.  The film then shows Dubya's decision to enter Iraq as president under the belief that WMDs were to be found there and the influence in particular of such advisors as Dick Cheney (the Vice President), Karl Rove, and Condeleeza Rice.  The film does show for example that Colin Powell opposed the war initially but went along with it because of pressure from the other advisors.  The film does not show that Bush I opposed the war as well privately.  However, it does show the problematic relationship between Dubya and his father.  The film attempts to show widescale incompetence in the Bush White House and ends by showing a clueless Bush unaware about the lack of WMDs in Iraq.<br /><br />It seems that there are two theories of the Bush presidency.  Some see Dubya as stupid and incompetent while others see him as evil.  This film seems to be a farce showing an incompetent president unable to deal with the situation in Iraq.  The film shows how the events of September 11 were used to propel the U.S. into war with Iraq, which had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks of 9/11.  I'm not sure this theory is accurate or that the film is accurate in this respect.</p></body></html>

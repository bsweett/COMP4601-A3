This film is kind of choppy but thanks to Russell's delicate but fearless performance - she is the saving grace here. Adrienne Shelley wrote, directed, and co-stars in this romantic comedy, she is so believable and real - she was murdered before the film was released. Russell plays Jenna, a waitress who has a jealous and cruel husband. She ends up pregnant and starts an affair with her doctor played by cutie Nathan Fillon, and oh yeah Jenna loves to create unique and delicious pies. Whenever Jenna feels overwhelmed - baking pies is her salvation. It's a strange little film but the ending is sweet so give this indie sleeper a viewing, enjoy!</p></body></html>

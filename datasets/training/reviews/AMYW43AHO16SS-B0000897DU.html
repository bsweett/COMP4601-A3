<meta name="summary" content="White Men Can't Jump...But They Can Rap!!"></head><body><p>Marshall Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, gives a rather humbling performance as Jimmy "Bunny Rabbit" Smith, Jr.; a wanna-be rapper with problems bigger than what we can imagine.  He's down on his luck and has to move back home to his mom's house.  Couple that with the fact that he has a fear of rejection.  In more ways than one, his problems are our problems we face in everyday life.  This makes the movie smart and easy to manufacture.  It's not the best film, but it does entertain as well as tell an effective story about challenges and courage.</p></body></html>

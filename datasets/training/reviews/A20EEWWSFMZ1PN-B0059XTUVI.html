What went wrong, is that someone does not know how to make a movie. You might think that they were trying to be artsy-fartsy; however I think it was a thorough lack of movie making skills.<br /><br />For those who lived through the era they would be disappointed because nothing of any interest or any of the special highlights of Margret's life was displayed. I personally did not mind what was not shown. It was their hodgepodge chopped up moved back and forth through time inconsistent nonsense that not only ruined this film but any film they would've made on any subject. I put the blame squarely on Phyllida Lloyd - Director, Abi Morgan - Writer (screenplay), Damian Jones - Producer, Elliot Davis - Cinematographer, Thomas Newman - Composer, Simon Elliott - Production Designer, and Justine Wright - Editor.<br /><br />To keep you from having to guess what I'm talking about and actually watch snippets of this movie I'll tell you. As filler it shows a ditzy old Margret played by Meryl Streep who flashes back in time to have the real story "snippets of her life" displayed played by Alexandra Roach. Alexander does all the real parts in Meryl Streep gets the "Saturday Night Live parts."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The descent into madness"></head><body><p>Johnny Depp stars as writer Mort Rainey living in seclusion in a lakefront residence in upstate New York after having been estranged from his wife Amy, played by Maria Bello.  Depp is licking his wounds from the discovery of his wife having an affair in a motel room with Ted Milner played by Timothy Hutton.<br /><br />The Steven King created storyline gets weird almost immediately when Depp gets an unexpected visit from Southern drawling stranger John Shooter played by John Turturro.  Turturro alleges that Depp has plagiarized a story he had written and threatens him.  In short order everything surrounding Depp begins to become destroyed.  He asks for and gets help from detective type Ken Karsch played by Charles Dutton but the tragedies keep on occuring.<br /><br />In typical King fashion, the storyline gets a jolting twist when we discover that both Depp and Turturro may not be exactly what we think they are.  "Secret Window" was an entertaining but not especially noteworthy investment of 96 minutes.</p></body></html>

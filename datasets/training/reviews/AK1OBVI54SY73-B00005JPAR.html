<meta name="summary" content="A Well- Intentioned Film That Falls Flat"></head><body><p>I have no doubt that this film had good intentions with the message it presents- but nonetheless by the the middle of the film I had already lost interest. And no it's not because this wasn't a two hour packed action film- that has nothing to do with it.<br /><br />It for the most part at least for me had to do with Jackman and Weisz's relationship together in the film- their relationship was so bland because I definitely didn't feel any chemistry between them at all which can badly hurt any movie. Not to mention Weisz's character, although supposed to be so inspitational, I instead found very annoying. The rest of the cast refused to make any memorable impression on me as well.<br /><br />The story itself though fell flat long before it ended. Instead of building up to some amazing conclusion it instead left me amused and definitely not impressed.<br /><br />I give it one other star because of its very beautiful scenes and again it's good intentions. That's about all I can say positive of this film. And while a bunch of people will highly recommend it- I will not.<br /><br />2/5</p></body></html>

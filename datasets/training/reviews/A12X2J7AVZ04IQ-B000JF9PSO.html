In the brilliant hands of British director Paul Greengrass, we have a film of passion, confusion, and full-circle resolution that is presented with the utmost care and concern; and profound respect. I was fascinated, riveted to the screen, and terribly moved by the film. The DVD extras, interviews with the famiies, are quite moving. This is really a film to be seen by all, if only to let people know that evil can be overcome with grit and determination. There is definitely strength in numbers. Bravo to the editors, the humility to those relatively unknown actors playing the parts, and to Paul Greengrass for delivering a sad slice of American history with such sensitivity.</p></body></html>

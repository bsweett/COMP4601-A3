<meta name="summary" content="Kid slapstick action, not hard scifi like the classic oldie"></head><body><p>This film is an odd combination of adventure and comedy, aimed directly at a kids' audience rather than a deeper film that adults might enjoy as well.  It is fantastical, full of coincidences and miraculous survivals, and in the end completely unbelievable for hard scifi fans.  That being said, it does have some of its own magic and my kids absolutely loved it for a rollicking fun ride, even if for us, the parents, it was mere background noise.

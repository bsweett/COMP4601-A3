Meryl Streep's award-winning portrayal cannot save "The Iron Lady" (2011) from its bad filmmaking technique. Pretentiously directed, clumsily scripted and choppily edited, this cinematic travesty does a tremendous disservice to Margaret Thatcher and Streep's remarkable talents. A squandered opportunity to capture the life and times of Britain's first woman prime minister.</p></body></html>

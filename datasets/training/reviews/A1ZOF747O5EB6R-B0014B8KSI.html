It is a tense drama based around corporate intrigue and the use of extra-legal means to achieve a corporate end.  It is a tight, complex but ultimately rewarding film.<br /><br />The role of Michael Clayton is played by George Clooney who is employed by a large New York legal firm as a "fixer".  He deals with unusual problems as and when they arise.  In particular, he deals with the case of one of the firm's leading attorneys who seems to undergo some form of mental breakdown.  The attorney disrobes in front of the firm's best corporate client whilst depositions are being taken.  Clayton is brought in to find him and understand what on earth has happened.  In this regard, it is simply a case of a failure to take medication coinciding with a realisation that the client is demonstrably corrupted.<br /><br />As Clayton becomes more involved, his own life is placed in peril.  In fact, an attempt on his life is made at the opening of the film.  The film then goes back four days to bring us to this point.  The film requires some close attention at times but, in the end, a clear outcome is provided.  Corporate corruption gets its comeuppance.<br /><br />"Michael Clayton" is a very good film.  It shows that Clooney is more than just a light weight matinee idol as he is sometimes typecast.  Make an effort.  See this film.</p></body></html>

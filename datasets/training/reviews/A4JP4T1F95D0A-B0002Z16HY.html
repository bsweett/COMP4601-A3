<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic"></head><body><p>As an avid historian I was incredibly fascinated by the story of the last few days of the German Third Reich in Berlin.  The major players of the Nazi regime are all represented.  The story doesn't just portray them as one note villains--rather it paints a picture of all shades with acts of courage and evil alike, honor and deceit.  Bruno Ganz is terrific as Hitler.  The entire cast is fantastic as is the story.  The only thing that may turn people off is that the film is entirely in German with English subtitles.  You can't get much better than this.</p></body></html>

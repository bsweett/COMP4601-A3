<meta name="summary" content="An Excellent Comedy"></head><body><p>Aaron Eckhart has to be one of the most underrated actors today.  He makes another flawless performance in "Thank You For Smoking" - a comedy about tabacco, spin control, and public perceptions.  "Smoking" does a great job of showing how today's PR departments and "Spin Doctors" operate and just what their MO is exactly.<br /><br />Young Cameron Bright (Running Scared, X-Men 3) shows why he is a promising young actor in doing a superb job of playing Eckhart's son.<br /><br />The one funny thing about this movie - there is not one single scene with someone smoking a cigarette.<br /><br />Watch it - you will not be dissappointed.</p></body></html>

In fact, it's pretty easy to see the influences on "Sky Captain" -- from those that are acknowledged, like "Buck Rogers," to those that aren't, like "The Mysterians," "The Wizard of Oz," Max Fleischer's "Superman" cartoons, "When Worlds Collide," "Raiders of the Lost Ark," Gerry Anderson's various TV series, and more.<br /><br />As derivative as it is, "Sky Captain" unfolds with an exuberant, child-like grace.  No, we don't really believe that a tricked-out P-40 can do all of the things that this one can, any more than we believe that dead Lawrence Olivier was somehow resurrected for one more role.  But the first half hour of "Sky Captain" is so fast-paced, cut and framed like a bona fide film from the 1930s, that it's easy to forgive the lapses in reason - or the standard effort to make a female character "strong" by making her mouthy and impulsive or a male character sensitive by having him put up with it.  Eventually, the film's editing and pacing synch up with more contemporary films, which is a shame, really.<br /><br />The plot is relatively simple, if hard to swallow:  giant robots begin looting cities while a team of scientists, each connected to a mysterious inventor named "Totenkopf," are assassinated one by one.  When all else fails, Sky Captain (Law, looking like the love child of Timothy Dalton and Ewan MacGregor) and his private air force are called in, reuniting the hero with - great Caeser's ghost - a plucky reporter (big-footed Paltrow) a former lover (sexy, one-eyed Angelina Jolie), and his inventor friend, Dex (Giovanni Ribisi, here a poor man's Mickey Rooney).  Of course, the mystery sends them globetrotting, and what they find may make them wish they could just click their heels and be home again.<br /><br />The best thing about "Sky Captain" is the production design, which is a marvel of computer-generated sets and gadgets mixed in with live action from the cast.  Director and writer Kerry Conran definitely has more of an eye for the look of the film than for the script, as he falls into the standard contemporary motif of having characters who should be working together nonetheless (yawn) bicker in the most absurd of situations.  In this film, it's a "Star Wars"-like race through dangerous corridors of air space framed by Gotham's skyscrapers.  And, like a lot of other filmmakers today dodging the pesky issues of a lack of diversity/stereotyping in their works, he gets mileage out of setting the film in the past and making Asians and thinly-veiled Nazis the bad guys -- you know, just like many U.S. and British films of the period.<br /><br />Nonetheless, "Sky Captain" is worth a look, though be warned:  If you don't fall immediately in love with Ed Shearmur's "Sky Captain" theme, you'd better put a bucket over your head and hit it with a wooden spoon `cause that ditty's pretty much played all through the film.</p></body></html>

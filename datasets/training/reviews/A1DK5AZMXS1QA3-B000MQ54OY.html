This inability to sing and his flaunting of his dancing gets him outcast from his land.  Mumble falls in with a different group of penguins, who just happened to talk like Speedy Gonazeles, and who appreciate his dancing.  Mumble and five friends venture of to find aliens (human beings) and Mumble eventually ends up in a zoo in the US.  He returns to Antarctica with humans who discover how their commercial fishing is hurting the penguins, and hence stop.<br /><br />The movie features many big Hollywood names such as Elijah Wood as Mumble, Nicole Kidman as his mom, Brittany Murphy as Mumble's girlfriend, Hugo Weaving as the elder penguin, and Robin Williams.  The latter voices two roles, one Mexican and one messianic, and it is his performance that provides much of the comedy in this movie.  In a sense, this movie can be seen as Robin Williams' return to his normal roles.  Throughout the 80's and most of the 90's, Mr. Williams made his name in  zany comedies such as Popeye, Mrs. Doubtfire, Hook, Aladdin, and Patch Adams.  Thrown in the mix were funny dramas such as Good Morning Vietnam and the Dead Poet's Society.  Then in the late 1990's and early part of the 21st century, he hit rock bottom with fans and critiques alike with pure non-comedies like Insomnia, One Hour Photo, Jakob the Liar, Bicentennial Man and The Final Cut.  But in the end of 2006, he returned back to form with two comedies; Night at the Museum and Happy Feet.  Both movies feature Robin Williams in his traditional wacky, zany, combination of idiotic faces, sarcasm, slapstick action and bombastic dialogue.  Though Night at the Museum did better, this movie truly features Robin Williams at his best; two roles, sometimes involved in the same dialogue.<br /><br />Along with the comedy of Robin Williams, this movie features a lot of music from hip-hop, rock and roll, R&B, and even some country.  And the special effects are top notch.  all in all, a geat movie.</p></body></html>

Philip Seymour Hoffman is a priest with great compassion for his parishioners, and especially for a young altar boy whose father beats him on a regular basis.  Streep's character chooses this very compassion to challenge the priest and, using an incident reported by another nun, she works to discredit him and banish him from the parish.  Streep and Hoffman are wonderful actors and without their performances this would have been a much less powerful movie.  My husband and I had diametrically opposed views of what the truth was in the gray areas of the film, which says to me that it was a wonderful springboard for discussion.  I did feel that it was a little slow at times and that there should have been more proof for Streep's character to act as she did.</p></body></html>

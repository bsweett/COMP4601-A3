<meta name="summary" content=""Brenda Starr" meets "War of the Worlds""></head><body><p>An anonymous note brings Polly Perkins, ace woman reporter, to Radio City Music Hall to watch "Wizard of Oz."  An elderly gentlemen comes to her and tells her that he has information on the scientists who are disappearing.  Before his precipitous departure he tells her he's the next scientist to disappear and when she asks who's doing this, the one-word reply is Totemkopf.<br /><br />Next thing you know, a machine driven blitzkrieg hits NYC.  Mercenary "SSky Captain" (Jude Law) is flying over the city doing his best to kill the invading enemy machines.<br /><br />Perkins and Joe team up to solve both of the cases.  There's a lot of romentic and comedic tension between the two.  They used to be an 'item' til she caught him cheating on her and messed with his plane's fuel line.<br /><br />The effects are stunning.  The pellucid colors remind me of a vintage comic--or an old photo colored with Marshal oils.  The scenery is pretty amazing and the action good enough to keep you riveted in your seat for most of the show.<br /><br />True, the performance is not up to the actor's standard, but this is not a drama.<br /><br />The running plot about Paltrow and her camera was one of the funniest bits in the movie.  I can so relate to her problems with taking pictures.<br /><br />Overall, a very worthwhile film to own and watch again.</p></body></html>

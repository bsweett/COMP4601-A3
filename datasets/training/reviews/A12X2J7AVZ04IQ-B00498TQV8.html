A film this complex can only be appreciated if one can understand its rich wealth of subtext, motivation and family pride. Jennifer Lawrence's Ree isn't just looking for her dad. She has a desperate drive to hold on to her family home; her concern for her young siblings and ill mom are a powerful motivation. The almost animal-like behavior of the local folk is merely an age-old tradition of survival. These traditions are sacred, secrets abound, and we are along with Ree in her quest of discovery; her idea of family is more profound than most (since most of the folk are in-bred, referred to often). Ms Lawrence is riveting in her performance, a wisdom way beyond her years, a determination and zeal not willing to compromise and go quietly. She must certainly be deserving of an Oscar nomination. Excellent support from John Hawkes (her uncle, Teardrop) and the feisty Dale Dickey, a tough broad with more than she's telling. Debra Granik's direction is fine, with precision that flows seamlessly. Filmed in the Missouri Ozarks, many locals were used to fill other supporting roles, and they all succeed. The little kids were naturals, nothing forced or phony in their portrayals. The final resolution is a little unsettling, but wrought with a severity that almost unhinges Ree, but she stays strong to the bitter end. Not a million laffs, but loaded with talent; the Ozark setting is a character unto itself. Lots of good DVD extras. Music created added atmosphere, and was well-executed. I think this film is worthy on many levels.</p></body></html>

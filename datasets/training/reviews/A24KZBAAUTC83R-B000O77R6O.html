<meta name="summary" content="The Fountain Spills Over..."></head><body><p>Director Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain was overall just too slow and ambitious to make it a huge Box Office hit.<br /><br />We found it a beautifully crafted film, with a touching storyline with themes like timeless love in past, present and future all shown in such a magnificent way, albeit so slowllllly, made The Fountain at times hard to keep the viewer interested.<br /><br />But we applaud the director's eye for film-making, both in visual style and all the drama he captured from his two major stars - Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz - who do an outstanding job with the roles given to them.<br /><br />Bradd Pitt walked off the set of The Fountain, purportedly to play Hugh Jackman's character, placing Aronofsky's movie in dire trouble of ever being made. But Hugh Jackman stepped in and saved the day.<br /><br />With the mass appeal of this film, with the unfortunate slow script that made it more of a sleeper than a thriller, The Fountain reverberates with visually stunning scenes of life, death, and time-jumping sequences that at times were spellbinding.<br /><br />This would have been a much bigger major hit if the movie would have had more of the adventure feel that the beginning of the film began with, tantilizing filmgoers into hoping for a more balanced film with both drama, love, AND major adventure. Unfortunately the slow pacing of the film taxes the moviegoer.</p></body></html>

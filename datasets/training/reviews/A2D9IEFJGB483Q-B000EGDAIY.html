<meta name="summary" content="Stylistically, it's all there."></head><body><p>This film has everything I hate about horror. The manipulative music, the gross-outs, the suspense without the suspension of disbelief, and a lack of an Eternal Cosmic Truth bore me. In fact, most horror has the same message: "Humans are powerless against evil."<br /><br />So we have this infidelity which leads to a curse, and the curse leads to "random acts of violence."  At its core, this is an infection story, similar to communicable vampirism, Night of the Living Dead, or the Borg's assimilation. Consequently, this is a treadmill, or rat-wheel plot: it goes round and round, but goes nowhere.  Buffy Michelle Geller can do nothing to stop the curse. Her best efforts are not enough.<br /><br />Stylistically, however, it's all there. The lighting, framing, and composition are all there.  Retaining the original Japanese setting adds to the eeriness.  We speaking of losing something in translation, but this film adds something in translation. As Merian C. Cooper, of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHQTZO">King Kong (1933) (Single-Disc Edition)</a> fame, said, "Keep it distant, difficult, and dangerous."  Well done, Rami!</p></body></html>

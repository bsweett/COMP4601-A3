When a shark comes to Amity Island, Chief Brody has to figure out a way to kill the shark on 4th of July. Thanks to the uptight mayor, innocent people get eaten and Brody hires Quint to kill the shark. Brody, Matt Hooper, and Quint all take the Orca to find the shark and kill it. If you love horror and classics, you'll love JAWS!!!</p></body></html>

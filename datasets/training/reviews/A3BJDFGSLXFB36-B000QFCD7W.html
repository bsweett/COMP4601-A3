<meta name="summary" content="4 stars due to the actors' chemistry"></head><body><p>I have to strongly disagree with the [...] review of this film.<br /><br />I thought the chemistry between the 4 main actors is what made this film. It's an enjoyable movie that has a lot of heart and the main characters' friendships are quite believable. Even though the plot is pretty predictable, it does have some genuinely funny and touching moments. I did, however, feel that Marissa Tomei was not used to her fullest. She is merely a cardboard cut-out instead of a supporting actress (she is capable of SO much more)and she really doesn't have all that much to do in the film except serve as a love interest for William H. Macy.<br /><br />The sound and picture quality are both very good and the DVD does offer some decent, if not great, extras (the gag reel was TOO SHORT!).<br /><br />It's worth a rental, but I don't think I will buy this title until it is offered at a really cheap price.</p></body></html>

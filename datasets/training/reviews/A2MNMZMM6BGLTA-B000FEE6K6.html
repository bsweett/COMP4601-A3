<meta name="summary" content="A 2 maybe a 3"></head><body><p>The one thing I noticed when I was going to review this movie was making the decision about giving it a 2 or a 3 stars. I don't think it is good enough to be a 3 by some of the other movies I have rated but I don't think it is bad enough to be a 2. So 2 1/2 I guess. I saw the previews of this movie and thought I would check it out. I looked like an interesting premise based on a very interesting subject. I thought that Nicholas Cage did an excellent job as the former Russian immigrant who turned small time arms dealer and then into an major international arms dealer. Again the subject is something that is very intriguing and very interesting but alas the movie just drags. I remember when watching it thinking, "this is going to be good." Then, "this is pretty good" and then as it went on and on I was thinking, "man, ok, I wish this thing would wrap up and end." So somewhere in there it lost me. Jared Leto was accutally pretty good as Cages brother and Cage has a pretty hot wife. The guy that plays the African dictator is great and does a really good job. The movie also shows a lot about the politics and cultures of the African nations that are torn and fed by violence and arms. Also I almost forgot that Ethan Hawke is very good as the ATF guy that is pursuing Cage. But somewhere in all this the movie loses something and is over long and just not that good.</p></body></html>

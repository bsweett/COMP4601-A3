<meta name="summary" content="WOW!! REAL GOOD!!!"></head><body><p>I really like scary movies and have big giant collections of it...I rented this movie one night on Saturday with friends we watched it...we was in edge of  our seat.. IT'S SCARY!. Cast was great & acting was good. Looks like a good old fashion scary movie back in 70s and 80s..And makes me more chilling," Base on true story"!!!...Day after I bought this DVD for more collection! U know this movie and HOSTEL they came out almost same time on DVD...but this WOLF CREEK have a lots scarier and more chilling to that junk. Loved it..Don't miss it see it for sure or buy it... if u like scary movies..A</p></body></html>

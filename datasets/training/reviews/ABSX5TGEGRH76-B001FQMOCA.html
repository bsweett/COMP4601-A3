I haven't heard much of his music, but after seeing Walk The Line, which shows his rise, fall, and rebirt, I realize that I am missing out.<br /><br />Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) grew up on a farm.  His father Ray (Robert Patrick) always liked Johnny's older brother more, seeing Johnny as good for nothing, and throwing his life away listening to the Carter family sing on the radio.  After Johnny's brother died, Ray blamed Johnny.<br /><br />While in the air force, Cash began writing songs about being in prison, despite having never been incarcerated himself.  Upon his return to the States, he married his childhood sweetheart Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), despite her father's protests and fears that Cash wouldn't be able to provide for her.  And at first, he can't.  He is too preoccupied with becoming a music star that he can't concentrate on his door-to-door sales job.  Finally, he decides to take his band, which, according to Vivian, is composed of two mechanics who can't play well, to a recording studio run by Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts), owner of Sun Records.  Some of the other artists Phillips signed include Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton), Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne), and Waylon Jennings (Shooter Jennings).  While on tour, Johnny meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon), who was one of his idols while growing up.  She still sings, but she also performs comedy sideshow routines between the "real" musicians.  As Johnny and June get to know each other while they tour together, an attraction forms between them, and they become best friends.  While this is fine for June, who is also married, Johnny wants more.  Soon, he also gets into drugs, which eventually get him kicked off a tour when he forgets the lyrics to his songs and kicks out the footlights on stage.  Meanwhile, his homelife continues to get worse.  Vivian isn't very supportive of him during his dark days (I'm told that the real Vivan Cash was more supportive than portrayed here, but I guess the film needed to make a few adjustments for the purposes of drama), and she becomes very jealous of June's relationship with her husband.  Eventually, Johnny drives away everyone he loves; his wife, his three daughters, and his band.  The only person who sticks by him during his darkest times is June.<br /><br />While I'm sure that some of the events were a little embellished (as I already said, Vivan's character was a little off), these are all real events and they are as exciting as even some the best fictional love stories.  June's committment to her best friend is amazing, and Johnny's struggle, while not unique, is definitely trying for everyone involved.<br /><br />Phoenix and Witherspoon deserve special recognition for their performances here.  Both of them nailed their characters so well.  Phoenix was able to perfectly imitate Cash's trademark deep voice and both of them did their own singing!  Every actor involved did very well, but these two were amazing.  It's too bad that Witherspoon gets stuck in so many silly romantic comedies, because she is truly wasting her talent in them.<br /><br />Biopics aren't my favorite genre of films, but this one stands out as one of the greatest I've ever seen.  It's got a great story as well as an amazing soundtrack.</p></body></html>

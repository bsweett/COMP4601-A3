<meta name="summary" content="A good romantic comedy with lots of genuinely funny moments"></head><body><p>Unlike the previous reviewers of this film, I have the advantage of actually having seen the film at a preview here in Chicago.  I'm happy to report that it is a very decent comedy with many moments that are genuinely funny.  It doesn't quite belong to a genre of comedy known as a remarriage comedy (where a couple splits up and then reconciles despite a host of obstacles), but it isn't far from it.  I won't spoil the film by explaining precisely why it doesn't quite fit that mould.  I'll merely say that it isn't quite as predictable as one might assume at the outset.<br /><br />The plot is fairly simple.  Two people meet at the Cross-town Classic at Wrigley (for non-Chicagoans, that is what Major League Baseball likes to call the Cub-Sox inter-league series) and buy a condo together.  They break up, but neither seems willing to move out.  Comedy ensues as they play a series of mind games with one another.<br /><br />A plot this bare bones could be either good or bad or something in between, depending on what you graft onto the story.  Luckily, most of what they do is quite funny.  Much of the success of the film stems from Vince Vaughan's fabulous gift for comedy.  Jennifer Aniston, who has of course been linked to Vaughan after they met on the set of this film, does a very fine job, but it is Vaughan who drives the film's comedy.  What follows their break up is a string of very funny moments as each tries to get back at the other.<br /><br />There is a very odd bit of somewhat dirty humor in the film.  Jennifer Aniston's character gets a wax treatment in her nether regions known as a Telly Savalas, so that she will make her former boyfriend jealous and desirous when she walks about the apartment naked.  It isn't hard to imagine what that involves, but what makes it odd is that Telly Savalas was Jennifer Aniston's godfather.  Her father, John Aniston (born Anastassakis), was a very close friend of his fellow Greek Savalas and asked him to be Jennifer's godfather.  I just fine it a very, very odd joke given her relation to Savalas.<br /><br />One of the reasons the film is so much fun is the very strong supporting cast.  My fellow Arkansan and Little Rock native Joey Lauren Adams plays Aniston's best friend.  Like many people I first became aware of Vince Vaughan in the Jon Favreau film SWINGERS.  Favreau plays one of Vaughan's best friends in this one, though I swear he must weigh 80 pounds more than he did in SWINGERS.  Vincent D'Onofrio plays one of Vaughan's brothers.  The hugely talented (but under-utilized by Hollywood) Judy Davis has a somewhat inappropriate role as an art gallery owner.  But two actors formerly of ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT supply two of the best contributions to the film.  That series's star Jason Bateman has a couple of typically funny moments (using pretty much the same deliver he used for Michael Bluth) and one wishes he had had a larger role.  But John Michael Higgins stole every scene he was in as Aniston's almost-gay brother.  The funniest part of the film might be when he tries to get everyone to sing a song at a dinner early in the film.  On ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT he played the highly professional and perpetually stone-faced lawyer Wayne Jarvis, though film goers will remember him best as the gay dog handler in BEST IN SHOW and the co-leader of a musical group in A MIGHTY WIND.<br /><br />The only reason I can't give this film five stars is that it had some persistent pacing and rhythm problems.  At several points the film drags a bit, scenes not moving at the right pace, the film lingering over bits just a little too long.  It is hard to say precisely who is to blame for such things.  Initial suspicion would go to the film's editor, but sometimes pacing can be dictated by the director or even the producers.  There is no way to tell who is to blame, but the film just doesn't have as much life as it ought to have had.<br /><br />But nonetheless, this is a solid comedy that will delight most viewers.  It isn't a farce like Vaughan's hit from last summer, THE WEDDING CRASHERS, but more in the lines of a very funny date movie.  I would like to add that it is one of the better Chicago films I have seen in a while.  There are a number of Chicago locations that are seen in a host of movies, but also a few that rarely are.  All in all, a very enjoyable movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Should have stayed a secret"></head><body><p>This movie has one redeeming quality, well two. Depp ain't bad and the ground level premise of the two stories &quot;The Secret Window&quot; being similiar ain't bad either, but beyond that, what we have here is a monstrous mess. Whoever cast the role of the Mississippi 'guy', the townsfolk, the maid, the sheriff, etc., should now be unemployed. Awful acting, hammy, and anything else you can dream up that is b-a-d. Extras? When a movie is this poorly made, who cares. I found my local rental store has this movie miscategorized, it should be under comedy. If you are still looking for a 'new' suspense/horror movie on par with the Ring, keep looking.</p></body></html>

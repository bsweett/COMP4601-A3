<meta name="summary" content="an utterly bizarre story that works a la Burton"></head><body><p>If you want to enter a parallel universe between living and dead, then this is your film.  A disappointed young man, in a fault of circumstance, becomes wedded to a living corpse, who draws him in and loves him.  He wonders which way to choose, with many characters and strange interactions with both the living and the dead.  It is believable, funny, and has its own magic.  This is a solid and good film.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

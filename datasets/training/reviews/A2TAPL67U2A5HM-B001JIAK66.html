<meta name="summary" content="Van Helsing (Widescreen Edition)"></head><body><p>Van Helsing (Widescreen Edition) is a horror/action movie with a thin plot but still it is very enjoyable. The special effects are quite good and what is not to like when the fabulous Kate Beckinsale is in it. Hugh Jackman does an alright job with the part that is giving to him as Van Helsing on speed. Do not expect a smart or thought worthy plot. See it for what is, a great popcorn movie that is filled with action, great special effects and many beautiful women and then it gets 3/5 since it never promised anything else to begin with.</p></body></html>

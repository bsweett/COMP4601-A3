Whether the film is "good" or "bad" is hardly the question, it was funny!  Shawn Levy has directed some comedies like "Big Fat Liar" with Frankie Muniz, "Just Married" with Ashton Kutcher & Brittany Murphy & "Cheaper by the Dozen" with Steve Martin.  Bringing back Jacques Clouseau with Steve Martin was a great pairing.  There are so many funny bits like the ball he clumsily sets in motion that bounds down the stairs of the ministry to upset bicyclists and then it keeps reappearing throughout the film, still knocking down things.  Steven Martin drives the new Chrysler Daimler Smart Car that will be coming to the US next year and parks it hilariously knocking off the bumpers of the larger cars around him and then oblivious of the havoc he's wrought keeps going as if he's perfect and makes no errors.  The DVD deleted scenes where he leans on the molding in Dreyfus' office and knocks it off the wall is so silly!  "That's where it wants to be & we should respect that," he says after knocking it off about the third time.  Then when Emily Mortimer from "Match Point" & "Windtalkers" is hanging a picture, she winds up with Martin's face in her skirt as he twirls about trying to gallantly set her down.  I laughed so hard.  Henry Czerny is a fine actor from "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" and "Eye of the Killer."  As the guilty Yuri, he adds a nice comic stupidity to the crime.  Kristen Chenoweth from "Bewitched" & "RV" bubbles delightfully as Cherie.  Jean Reno from "The DaVinci Code" & "Ronin" does a good job as Gendarme Gilbert Ponton who seems as much spy & conspirator as he does friend & partner.  Kevin Kline does a nice job as the Inspector Dreyfus who hires Clouseau for his incompetence.  The cameos by Jason Statham as the coach and Clive Owen as double-O-six are excellent.  Beyonce Knowles as Xania looked very nice in her dress.  "The Pink Panther" may not have been profound, but it did give me repeated belly laughs.  And that is just what the doctor ordered!  Bravo!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A gloomy and gothic nightmare!"></head><body><p>A Dance Academy in Germany was the selected stage for Dario Argento to drive us an authentic horror Rock Opera. The visual aesthetic is of first-rate; the handle camera is very innovative; great frames, the visual field is enriched with the accurate employment of the objective and lenses. This macabre story deals with weird voices from the outer world and  sinister pacts and witches.<br /><br />Jessica Harper owns a spelling beauty that contributes to accent the dark atmosphere of this worthy suspenseful tale. The soundtrack is supported by The Globbins.</p></body></html>

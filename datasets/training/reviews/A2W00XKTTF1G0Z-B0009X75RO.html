<meta name="summary" content="Cathrine and Richard are Amazing Performers!"></head><body><p>CHICAGO is a fantastic and energetic adaptation of a great Broadway musical to come to the silver screen in a long, long time. It has magic and electricity and is filled with extremely brilliant musical performances by Catherine Zeta-Jones (Traffic, American Sweethearts), Richard Gere (Pretty Women, An Officer And A Gentleman) and Rene Zellweger (Jerry MaGuire, Me Myself & Irene). They all have extremely well refined voices and the performances of Zeta-Jones's singing with her incredible dancing was memorizing. And, who knew Richard Gere could sing and dance?<p>The movie stayed true to the original Broadway production originally co-written, directed and produced by Bob Fosse (Cabaret, Sweet Charity, Lenny & All That Jazz). It is faced paced and quickly edited and with some clever usage of stage scrims/screens and neon you will ever see on the big screen. It is amazing! The production design and the camera work keep you on your toes!<p>Other standout performances include John C. Reilly (The Perfect Storm, Magnolia) as the not-so-bright husband of Rene and then the "mother of them all" as far as tough female wardens go - Queen Latifah (Sphere, The Bone Collector). They both have incredible voices and screen presences.<p>Directed and choreographed by Rob Marshall (Annie) who also choreographed Annie, Mrs. Santa Claus and Cinderella for Disney ABC TV productions. It has a very big "showman" type feel and look to it.<p>The story is sharp and witty and revolves around the women in prison who kill their boyfriends, lovers or husbands.. The music and energy are well worth the ticket. Don't miss this movie! (1-2-03)</p></body></html>

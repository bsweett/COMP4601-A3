<meta name="summary" content="The Dumbing Down of Narnia! C. S. Lewis Would Be Spinning In His Grave!"></head><body><p>I now understand why so many great writers will never, or only under the rarest of circumstances, allow their stories to be turned into movies while they are still alive!<br /><br />There's no excuse for this  horrible adaptation! - "The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe"  was a masterpiece,  so having the  genius to make  a C. S. Lewis story into a great film was not an issue. Nor was money! Hollywood made a lot of  cash from it's first venture into Narnia! And finding four child & teen actors with fine acting talent to play the lead roles was a smash success. So why such a violent and unimaginative Prince Caspian?<br /><br />One can only speculate.  The screenplay, acting and passion are so lacking this time around that I truly wish this story never made it to the Big Screen! I feel this disaster of a film will even damage the Narnia "brand." Since making money seems to be Hollywood's only motivation in making this  film, they should know better!<br /><br />Prince Caspian was  all about fighting and killing, and more killing and more fighting. One scene shows the slaughtering of retreating Narnians and even the deliberate killing of one's  own soldiers in the process. If  you want to see real evil in a dumbed down fashion, you'll see plenty in this movie! NOR IS THIS FILM APPROPRIATE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN! There's certainly nothing cute or delightful about Prince Caspian!<br /><br />Even Aslem was portrayed as a capricious deity, who didn't lift a paw until a child had to risk her life in order to get his attention. Meanwhile, Narians are being crushed to death by flying boulders, while Aslem leisurely has a chat with her about old times.  This screenplay must have been written by an Atheist or someone with a very dark sense of humor!<br /><br />I frequently write reviews on films I have strong feelings about. I like to encourage people to see a good film and discourage them from seeing a bad one. Let's face it, we have so many entertainment choices. But another reason I write reviews is to congratulate Hollywood for a job well-done, or like in this case, when a film is an unmitigated disaster, I hope to affect their bottom line. Because  Hollywood is always confronted with two broad choice: To treat a story as art - with respect, passion and genius like they did in "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe;"  or do the opposite, and treat it like a commodity, which has the feeling of a product made on a factory assembly line! Memo to Hollywood: If you venture in Narnia again fire the current crew and bring in some fresh talent! I challenge you to make your next film one that will stand the test of time!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/059540023X">Better Living Through Bad Movies</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452270057">Bad Movies We Love (Plume)</a></p></body></html>

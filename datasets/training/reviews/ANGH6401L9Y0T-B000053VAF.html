<meta name="summary" content="Deeply, Cynically Funny"></head><body><p>As it says in "My Sunday Dogma Missal" which accompanies this DVD, "I'm banking on the fact that God has a great sense of humor." Cited as evidence is the platypus.<br /><br />This is an extraordinary, even a supernaturally funny movie. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are two fallen angels, Bartleby and Loki, who have discovered a loophole in God's law that will allow them to get back into heaven. However, the Voice of God (Alan Rickman; you know, Snape?) says if they make it, all existence will end. Something about God having been proved wrong, or something. Such a contradiction would bring down the whole works.<br /><br />So the Voice of God appears to the Last Scion (I'll let him explain that) and convinces her she's got to go to New Jersey and stop Bartleby and Loki from getting a plenary indulgence by entering a newly rededicated church run by the trendy new age bishop played by George Carlin. Along the way, she meets more crazy divine characters than you or I could imagine. But Kevin Smith, who wrote and directed the film, has way more imagination than you and I put together. It's good he does, too, because he's mixed together some of the most incredible twists and turns on a plot that, amazingly, makes a certain amount of sense.<br /><br />It is to laugh, of course, but it is also really about God and religion. And so you might find yourself believing this alternate reality is more rational than the one we are currently living in.<br /><br />Five stars. Really. Earned every one.</p></body></html>

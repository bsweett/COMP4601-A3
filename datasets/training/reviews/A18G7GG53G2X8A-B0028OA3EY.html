On the one hand, it has enough heart to render anyone within a five-mile radius deeply moved. It's not just a meaningless gathering of action, mayhem, and special effects; it actually goes deeper by presenting a story filled with complexity and emotion, all in the face of stylized danger. I'm afraid I can't describe that aspect any further because doing so would give away some really important plot points. Let's just say that Superman's return enables a wealth of repressed feelings to resurface, some of which have been kept secret for a long time. This alone is enough for a recommendation.<br /><br />However, I had some major problems with the film as a whole, and that brings me to the other hand. As classic and well loved as Superman is, this new story doesn't do much to enhance his reputation. Nor does it make it worse; what it does do is prevent him from transcending his well-established image. It's so well established that he practically vanishes behind a gigantic cliche. As I watched "Superman Returns," I came to the realization that he's really not that interesting a character anymore. We live in an age when heroes like Spider-Man, Batman, and the X-Men rake in the big bucks at the box office. True, they were all created in comic book stories many, many years ago. But through the talents of screenwriters and directors, they've been able to stay fresh, energetic, and edgy on the big screen. Superman, however, is exactly the same as he was when he started out back in the late 1930s. Even today, he can dodge bullets and lift heavy objects. He still has x-ray vision, and he can still shoot lasers from his eyes and blow frost onto a fire. And he still believes in truth, justice, and the American Way.<br /><br />I suppose now you can see why I'm so torn over this film. I loved its humanity but was disappointed by its lack of originality. I was also disappointed by Superman's overall look. Replacing Christopher Reeve is Brandon Routh, a young man whose role called for him to be dressed in a rubberized suit and for his hair to be overly slick and shiny. I thought he looked more like a plastic Ken doll than a real person. Looking so fake and pristine doesn't exactly add to his credibility as a character. However, it does help that his physique and facial expressions bear a striking resemblance to Reeve's. Somehow, I found that it gave the entire project legitimacy; Routh recaptures a wonderful performance as established in Richard Donner's original 1978 film.<br /><br />One of the best things about that film was the opening sequence. It showed the credits flying towards the camera amid shots of outer space, all the while playing John William's triumphant main theme. "Superman Returns" opens in much the same way, and it includes William's theme (interwoven throughout the film with John Ottman's original score). But this time, the credits move so quickly that you barely have time to notice any of the names. Luckily, few people care about reading names at the beginning of a movie; all they're really interested in is getting lost in the story, which in this case is incredibly interesting. Superman returns to Earth after an intergalactic journey to the remains of Krypton, his former home planet. Apparently, pieces of it had recently been discovered, and it forced him to wonder whether or not the planet was, in fact, completely destroyed. Of course, we all remember the destruction scene from the first movie (if you don't, this new movie takes a couple of seconds to remind you).<br /><br />After reuniting with his widowed mother, Martha (Eva Marie Saint, whose character is barely developed), he returns to Metropolis as the clumsy Clark Kent and gets his old job back at the Daily Planet. All the important characters are still there. First, there's Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington), the good-natured but undeniably geeky photographer. Then there's the head honcho, Perry White (Frank Langella), a man that's always ready for the next big scoop. Finally, there's Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), the headstrong reporter. Upon his return, Clark is surprised to learn that Lois has since gotten involved in a relationship and has had a child. He also learns that she had written an article entitled "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman" (which, interestingly, earned her a Pulitzer Prize). He realizes then that his untimely disappearance turned her bitter and resentful. She even seems to behave strangely towards the Clark Kent alter ego, never really interested in giving him the time of day despite not seeing him in many years. (Why no one could see the coincidence there is beyond me; I think it's gotten to the point where not realizing Clark Kent and Superman are one and the same is implausible.)<br /><br />Superman first reappears in public after he prevents a jet plane from crash landing. It was a plane that just happened to have Lois as a passenger (covering a story, no less). This heroic stunt is the first of many encounters that forces her to reassess her feelings. Yes, she does love her boyfriend, Richard (James Marsden), and rightfully so; he's a good-natured, friendly man, and he cares deeply for Lois and their son, Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu). But Superman was always the one she truly loved, and that brings on a multitude of conflicting emotions. It gets even more intense when she begins to notice the way Superman and her son have formed a subtle yet significant connection.<br /><br />Of course, no "Superman" story would be complete without the inclusion of Lex Luthor, the evil criminal mastermind whose hatred of the flying goody-two-shoes is only surpassed by his lust for world domination. Taking the reigns from Gene Hackman is Kevin Spacey, who gives Luthor a diabolical edge that served the film well. This is not just in terms of the story; it's also in terms of the genre. Only a comic book villain could think up grandiose schemes that could never be accomplished in real life. Most of the time, they involve large gadgets, unheard of technologies, and the proposed death of millions.<br /><br />Luthor adheres strictly to that mindset, always being able to conjure up delightfully over the top ideas. In the original film he attempted to sink the entire California coast by launching a missile into the San Andreas Fault. Now he intends to literally create his own continent in the middle of the ocean, a feat that can only be accomplished with special crystals. Specifically, he needs the self-generating crystals that make up the structure of Superman's Fortress of Solitude. Naturally, he has the power and resources to collect everything he needs. The most unnecessary resource was his Pomeranian-loving female companion, Kitty (Parker Posey). Her semi ditzy behavior is not at all compatible to his sophisticated demeanor, and I just couldn't believe he actually wanted to be around her.<br /><br />His careful scheming sets into motion the comic book side of the story, the side that doesn't focus on complexity or meaning so much as it focuses on special effects and entertainment. It would be hypocritical of me to say that I didn't have fun watching those scenes. Let's face it; eye candy is great in a comic book adventure film. But they didn't enliven the experience for me, either. If anything, I felt like I was watching an undeveloped idea, one that never really took off because it was bogged down by unoriginal qualities (such as the fact that "Metropolis" is really Manhattan). But as I said before, the humanity it presents is so touching that it outweighs all the other flaws. It's that aspect of "Superman Returns" I want everyone to see, the one that delves into genuine emotion without getting overly sappy. So am I recommending this movie? Yeah, I guess I am, but just barely (if I could, I'd give it three and a half stars). It's a recommendation made in the hope that the emotional experience will be enough to satisfy you. If it isn't, then don't say I didn't warn you.</p></body></html>

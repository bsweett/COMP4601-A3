<meta name="summary" content="Clint's best effort in years"></head><body><p>Million Dollar Baby proves to be Clint Eastwood's finest effort as an actor and as a director in recent decade. And yes, I do believed that its definitely superior to Mystic River. The script is beautifully written, a character study about boxers and Eastwood's direction moves the film along at a crisp and well grounded pace.<br /><br />Hilary Swanks plays a female who wanted to be a boxer. Eastwood plays the trainer who ended up pushing her to the championship title bout. There are excellent chemistry between the two actors and thanks to a great script, there are great deal of believability in their dialogue. While boxing is the theme, this movie is about these two characters, each with their own pains, their own dreams and when combined, they created a bond between them that transcends the boxing world.<br /><br />I thought Clint Eastwood performed fantastically in this movie but I believes that he will be overlooked because his character in this movie looks much like most of his characters in other movies: loner, estranged family members, guff and history of many regrets. For Hilary Swank, this movie should put her up again in the "A" class of actresses. Let hope that she will learn to pick better projects in the future. Morgan Freeman does his usual great job but I felt he was bit under used. His narration was fine but his presence was needed more.<br /><br />Overall, a fantastic job by Clint Eastwood, a moving character study film that should be seen by all. (This movie is nothing like "Rocky".)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the all time greats"></head><body><p>Now and then, someone asks you what your favorite movie of all time is.  The Usual Suspects is on my short list.<br /><br />The first time I watched it, I was a bit confused by it.  Then came that ending, that final shot.  It was an "oh my god" moment.  I am rarely surprised by "surprise endings".  They are usually telegraphed early on.  But this one completely had me.<br /><br />It is one of those movies you enjoy more the second and third and fourth time around, always picking up things you missed before.<br /><br />It has a great villain.  That is very important to a story.  There is no hero, which, come to think of it, is odd.  But the villain is nearly of the magnitude of Tolkein's character Sauron.  How about a Kaiser Soze action figure?  No, that would ruin the ending, wouldn't it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Keanu takes on the role of Constantine...."></head><body><p>An Ok actioner based on the comic book called Hellblazer about John Constantine, played by Keanu Reeves (The Matrix Triology, Point Break) who's smoking himself to death...hell wants him and heaven wont take him but earth needs him is basically the theme for the movie and he embarks on a case of twins, both played by Rachel Weisz (Runaway Jury, Confidence) and one of them mysteriously dies but the other twin doesnt believe that she would kill herself. So, Constantine shows her what he sees...soon, Constantine learns that the Devil's son wants to get loose onto the world and in order for him to do that he needs God's blood and the vessel is the remaining twin Weisz. Not bad for what it is.....better then some of the movies that came out so far...better then Alone In The Dark. Reeves is alright though he has his moments though we can hardly hear him he talks so soft he pays up in the action sequences...its what he's good at. Weisz is pretty damn hot. Also starring Djimon Honsou (Gladiator, Deep Rising) as Poppa Midnight....good name for him...the voodoo man. Peter Stormare (Armageddon, Fargo) comes at the end playing Lucifier, decked out in all white (hey, it fits him well) Pruitt Taylor Vince (Identity, Mississippi Burning), Shea LeBouf (Holes, The Battle At Shaker Heights) is all grown up and is out of his teeny bopper faze and a surprising acting debut by Bush lead singer Gavin Rossdale who takes on the role as Balthazar. Isn't the best...I do not worship this movie to death but I liked it enough to recommend it to fans of the comic book or fans of any of the stars. Good yet not a masterpiece.</p></body></html>

With 600+ reviews written already, I won't waste any time going over the absurd plot,  ingenious characters or plentiful cameos. I just wanted to add my 2 cents, and my 5 stars, to this riotous 'high-brow' comedy from the Coens.<br /><br />The 10th anniversary edition has a good selection of extras, including making of features and the like. Also comes with Dolby 5.1, so you can really get lost in those dream sequences. Yeah! Yeah! YEAAAAAAH!</p></body></html>

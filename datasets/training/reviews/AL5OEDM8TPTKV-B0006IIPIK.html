<meta name="summary" content="Sky Captain's Reality Today"></head><body><p>One of the things I remember hearing about this movie before I saw it in the theaters was that it was all done with actors working in front of a blue screen. That little fact never really sunk in the entire time I was watching the film, not until I watched the "making of" documentary on the DVD. And now, I believe this is one of one of the most revolutionary, amazing films made.<br /><br />Sky Captain is a throw back to old adventure films of the 30's, a confident hero with a jaded past, a perfect reporter dying to get the scoop, a gum-popping best friend with a penchant for inventions, and a one-eyed general who's a tough dame. Set in New York City around the end of the 1930's, it's equally recognizable and not. A passenger blimp docks at the Empire State with a mysterious doctor on board, who summons Polly to a meeting at Radio City during a showing of the Wizard of Oz. She starts the mystery, only to be interrupted by flying machines attacking the Big Apple, which brings in our hero, and the adventure starts.<br /><br />There isn't a wasted moment or scene in this entire film. Trading character development for plot movement, the story treks along at breakneck speed, spinning a great yarn in the process. The acting, done in front of that blue screen, is phenomenal. Both Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow pull off the impossible, making us believe they are seeing what we are. Angelina Jolie plays her spoiler part well, offering a sultriness to a somewhat stern character. Another unsung actor hero is Giovanni Ribisi, playing best friend Dex, who truly embodies the innocent charm of movie characters of the 30's.<br /><br />However, all of this adds up to nothing if the visual effects weren't effective. And fortunately, they are not only effective, but they blow away the entire film. The look of this picture is unlike anything seen before, thanks to primary visionary Kerry Coran and his team of cohorts. Dark, sepia tones, magnificent special effects, incredible use of light and shadow all adds up to a visual feast never seen on cinema before.<br /><br />It astonishes me how the Oscars this year skipped over this film, maybe perhaps it will be recognized in its technical achievement. In the years to come, it will serve as a benchmark in movie making.</p></body></html>

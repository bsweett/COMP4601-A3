<meta name="summary" content="The Kids Are More Than Alright!"></head><body><p>I don't get out to the theater much, so when I saw the positive reviews for the film adaptation of Kick Ass back in April of 2010 I decided to give the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785134352">graphic novel</a> a try. First of all, it was a fun, very quick read, because it was heavy on the "graphic" and light on the "novel". Lot's of well-drawn, "graphic", colorful images with blood spurting everywhere (as well as other bodily fluids).<br /><br />Now it's very rare that I say what I am about to say and many of the book's fans, Mark Millar fans and just plain old folks that disagree will call me blasphemous, but....The movie adaptation of Kick Ass is better than the comic book; um, I mean book; er, I mean graphic novel. Oh sure, the movie takes some liberties over what was originally drawn out in print. In my opinion a good movie adaptation of a book needs only to be as good as or better than the original author's ideas, and Director Matthew Vaughn pulled this off flawlessly.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; the original story is mostly intact. Vaughn just takes the over the top, crazy-violent, captivating story of a teenager that dares to live out his dream of being a superhero to a new level in the film version. The story is very well written and flows superbly. Meet Dave Lizewski whose favorite pass-time is, you guessed it, comic books. Specifically, comic books with superheroes. And this kid's fantasy is, you guessed it, to be a superhero. So what do you think he does? (Okay, I'll stop saying "you guessed it" now.) He puts on a costume, calls himself Kick Ass, and he goes out looking for trouble. And he finds it.<br /><br />He also finds out that he's not alone in his fantasy world of kids gone superhero. Enter Hit Girl played by Chloe Moretz. Moretz's performance is a big part of what took Kick Ass from a 4-Star movie to a 5-Star movie for me. Moretz is no wimpy kid, and the girl she is in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG97G0">Diary of a Wimpy Kid</a> is nowhere to be found in Kick Ass. She slices, dices and she does it with a smile. Okay, yes, it sounds morbidly disturbed to praise an 11 year old for chopping up bad guys with such a seemingly pleasurable disposition. But, man, that one scene where she chops, then looks over at Kick Ass with that little girl, new front teeth smile as if to say, "check me out, wasn't that cool," only to repeat the same action a few more times unflappably just won me over.<br /><br />And the rest of the cast turn in A-List performances as well. Not just Aaron Johnson who plays Lizewski/Kick Ass, but the whole doggone cast...including Nicolas Cage as Big Daddy. Cage ain't no <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OVLBIU">Ghost Rider</a> in this movie; he's a quirky, washed up cop that's out for revenge against a mobster who framed him in a former life, and Cage plays the role perfectly. While the character of Big Daddy is a bit different from the tough guy character in the book, it takes nothing from the story and I think that only a preservationist could disagree.<br /><br />Like I said earlier, the story is deliberately over the top and even pretty believable up until some of our heroes start to develop super strength in some situations...perhaps not super strength, but maybe super-resilient powers is a better way to put it. But the great acting, directing and flawless execution of every scene made up for any of the silliness that wasn't designed to be silly.<br /><br />This one goes on my shelf right next to some of my other favorite cult classic movies. If you're already a fan too and you haven't heard, there's a Kick Ass 2 planned for 2012, but I'd predict that topping the original will be about as successful as topping...well...you try to name a cult classic sequel that has ever outdone itself. I couldn't think of one.</p></body></html>

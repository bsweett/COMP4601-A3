Foxx is a N.Y. cabdriver whose customer just happens to be a beautiful female attorney who just happens to give him her phone number, a move which happens to figure prominently in the plot later on.  Cruise is a hired killer who decides that Foxx will drive him from hit to hit, much against Jamie's will.  Murder and mayhem may keep the viewer's attention but when the dust clears it's obvious that the basic premise is so unlikely that it spoils the overall effect of the movie.</p></body></html>

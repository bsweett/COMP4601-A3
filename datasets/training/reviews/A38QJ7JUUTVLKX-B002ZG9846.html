<meta name="summary" content="The Most Fun I've had in a while!"></head><body><p>The movie lives up to it's name. Kick-Ass is a hilarious tongue-in-cheek parody of super heros and comics. It starts out with the main character (Kick-Ass) narrating. The audience sees a costumed hero leap from a tall building and...splat...lands on a taxi. The kid is a geek whose only super power seems to be that he is virtually invisible to the opposite sex. He gets it in his head that he should try to be a super hero. His disguise? A green wet suit. His first outing is not very successful, having been stabbed and then hit by a car. On the plus side he has metal reinfocements throughout his skeleton and deadened nerve ending. Meanwhile Big Daddy and Hit-Girl are disrupting a drug lord's operations (and humorous Batman jokes are plentiful). When the three meet, Hit-Girl shows that she more than lives up to her name, having been well tarined by her "Big Daddy." The movie has a simple, yet effective plot, delivers the action, the gun fights, the topical super hero references, a foul mouthed little girl, a dad who is out for revenge, and a comic nerd who eventually gets the girl of his dreams by the end of the film. It is highly recommended for an afternoon of pure escape and fun. It is a movie you can watch again and again, rooting for the heros, and watching the bad guys get what is coming to them. This is a must see! For fans of Kill Bill, Spider-Man,and Sin City.</p></body></html>

I had a lot of fun watching this film, and laughed out loud more than I have in a long time.  Val Kilmer and Robert Downey, Jr. are at the top of their game; the script is clever; and writer Shane Black pulls it off in his directorial debut.  They were enjoying themselves when they made this film, and it shows!  This is the kind of movie I was expecting when I watched the "Ice Harvest" -- while there were elements of that film that worked the whole left a bad taste in my mouth, even the funny elements seemed serious and forced.  In kiss kiss bang bang it all came together -- and worked, even at moments that should not have been funny (like a finger getting slammed OFF in a door, and then a dog eating the finger).  Nothing brilliant, nothing profound, just well-made solid madcap dark laughter enjoyment.</p></body></html>

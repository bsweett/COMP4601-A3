<meta name="summary" content="A Victory Of Acting Over Direction"></head><body><p>It does happen a few times when just the acting on screen overwhelms me to the extent that I want to forgive the movie of a few flaws(big and small) I never saw this movie in the theater because I thought it's a chick flick and that's all about there is to it. I was right about one thing though. It is a bit of a chick-flick with a message quite conveniently one of it's own. I've often felt dumbstruck by the many questions I've left unanswered from my high school life. Not everyone lives a life full of victories.<br /><br />I liked the character of Matt(Mark Ruffalo) a lot in the movie because I felt I could relate to him. I run into a lot of Matts in my life and a seldom do I realise what makes them be. I also realise High School is one time of your life that haunts you everyday with all of it's good and bad attributes.I'm not gonna waste my time relating the story to you. What I loved most about this film was a certain song "Vienna" that plays in the film. Jenna Rink is confused,terrified,panic stricken and she searches for a home in her parents bed. Now that to me was one outstanding moment in the film.<br /><br />What I disliked about the film,if I may talk about it , were the last ten mins and the extremely fast forwarded fairy tale type ending.But the entire movie makes up for it.<br /><br />DVD features-<br /><br />Absolutely awesome menu that makes sure you watch the movie more than once. (perhaps make other people watch it) Good subtitles when you miss out on a great lyric to a song playing. Very nicely done,indeed.<br /><br />Please Read,I suggest this movie to all those people who can look beyond themselves to look at a part within themselves.I can probably try but not put in a better way. Enjoy whatever works.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="CULT CLASSIC"></head><body><p>The beginning of the movie is Quentin Tarantino does Napoleon Dynamite, without the annoying flashbacks, just annoying first person narration. The first person narration eventually goes away. A geek kid decides to become a superhero, and as in real life he doesn't get superhero results. When he is faced with certain death he is saved by an 11 year old girl in a mask(Hit Girl). This is a remarkable scene as the sound track plays the music from the Banana Splits. Yes, the sound track helped make the movie.<br /><br />The initial scene with Nicolas Cage was also a great scene. In order to be a big hit, a movie needs a few great scenes and no bad scenes. I believe this film will be a cult classic. I thought the teen acting was all excellent except for the Red Mist. His bad acting was made up for by a sensational performance by Hit Girl (Dakota Fanning move over) who owned every scene she was in.<br /><br />The nudity mentioned on the box must refer to the quick glimpse we get of "National Geographic porno" we see on the computer while our hero has his pants at his ankles. Frequent f-bomb.</p></body></html>

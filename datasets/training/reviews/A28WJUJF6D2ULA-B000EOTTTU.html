Mainly that's a compliment but anyone familiar with his work knows there's something slightly....critical in that statement. Mallick's most recent film, The New World, is a courageous undertaking that blends one of the prettiest scores ever composed, with shots of absolute gorgeousness. Here we get a sense of the beauty of the central Atlantic coast of North America as it must have been in pre-colonial times, with its vast, intricately-interwoven realm of forests, marshes, and meadows, all laid out under the immensity of an unpolluted sky. Mallick's pace is brave and it challenges a viewer to be equal to it. He takes his time as his camera pans slowly past what seems individual blades of grass and single leaves on majestic cathedrals of trees. So powerful is all this beauty it nearly grows overpowering to the senses, and can come off as both innocently offered, and mentally tiring. What The New World needed was more involvement from its human cast. Scarcely a hundred sentences are uttered start to finish in a lengthy running time of nearly two and a quarter hours. The tribal life of the aboriginal peoples was, one discerned, probably accurate to the smallest detail, including a shot inside a charnel house; the English colonists, their fort, houses, ship, and later in the manor in England with its formal gardens (a stark contrast to the free expression of nature in the  untamed forests of North America) these too are careful recreations that reflect what was there in this period. The problem is there is a lack of balance in The New World and the tale of Pocahontas and the two foreign men who come to win her love definitely takes a back seat to Mallick's visuals, and seems lost amid the scale of this motion picture. The New World is a beautiful visual poem, but it barely qualifies as containing any story at all.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Great Movie"></head><body><p>Juno is a sweet movie with some very adult themes.  The adult themes involve teenage pregnancy, abortion, adoption, and adultery.  The story is told in such a fun and forthright manner, featuring some exceptional acting from Ellen Page and Michael Cera, that you get the feeling you are peeking in on real people.  A joy to watch and a memorable movie, it is no wonder that the film did so well with critics and at the Academy Awards.  A warm and gentle movie with some very heavy themes.  A 5 star film that is well-worth watching a couple of times.</p></body></html>

However, when they find out who the sniper in the war ravaged building is--it seems like it could be more than one of those killers up there--well, that's good cinema, period. And you can't help but feel the irony when the soldiers sing the tune to The Mickey Mouse Club. This moovy is epic, but not overbearing. It's got realness and rawness in it...don't expect buffoonery, or every thing being a set up for  rim shot jokes ala TV's MASH. War is insanity, war is intensity and Kubrick attempted to show that here.</p></body></html>

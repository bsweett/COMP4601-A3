I had heard that the movie made fun of everything from the war on terror to the Hollywood establishment. I had also heard about a puppet sex scene (which almost garnered the film a NC-17 rating) and that the film was full of foul language. I must say I was kind of surprised about how funny the movie actually is.<br /><br />TEAM AMERICA is about a group of five warriors from different parts of the country joined together to fight the War on Terror. The movie opens in Paris, France as we see much of the carefree happiness that the city has to offer.  A young French boy skipping along while eating a chocolate popsicle bumps into a Middle Eastern-looking man carrying a briefcase with flashing lights. The man stares him down and the child runs to his mother and tells her what he sees. They turn to leave and moments later Team America bursts onto the scene.  Team America succeeds in killing the terrorists and capturing the WMDs, but they also knock down the Eiffel Tower and have one of their own killed.<br /><br />Team America learns from I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E. (the group's super-duper computer) that terrorists are plotting a major world-wide attack 1,000 times the size of 9/11.  Their mentor, Spottswoode, knows they don't have a chance unless they can get an actor to join their team (that's right, an actor). So, he sets forth and finds the best actor in the world, Gary Johnston.  He brings Gary to the Team's hideout in Mt. Rushmore and tells him what's at stake. Gary joins the team, but upon learning after a successful mission that his involvement with the team possibly caused other people to be killed, Gary quits the Team and hits rock bottom (literally, after passing out in his own vomit).  With Gary's departure, the Team is left without an actor and they don't have a chance.  Michael Moore and all the members of F.A.G. (Film Actors' Guild) unknowingly assist the leader of the massive terrorist takeover, Kim Jong Il, as he prepares for world domination.  Only Gary Johnston can save the day, but only if he proves to Spottswoode that he is dedicated to the team.<br /><br />I was suprised at how humorous TEAM AMERICA is.  I was a little offended by all the foul language and felt it was overdone, but like the unnecessary sex scene that might have been the whole point. TEAM AMERICA has two major targets in the movie:  the war on terror and the Hollywood establishment.  The humorous jabs at the War on Terror are evident from the movie's opening scene in Paris and don't let up until the very end of the film.  As the only superpower in the world and the leader of democracy, we have a duty to "police" the world persay. However, no matter who we help (because we can't help everybody) somebody else is going to hate us because we didn't help them or because we helped their enemy.  Sometimes we overstep our duty and are careless. This is parodied in the movie and in a hilarious way.<br /><br />The second biggest target in the movie is the Hollywood establishment.  Hollywood is a powerful place and having been the center of the dream factory for almost a century, it's no wonder that many of the people who become stars think they are the kings and queens of the world.  As Bruce Campbell wrote about in CHINS THAT KILL, Hollywood is a land filled with spores. The spores cause people to not think logically and normally.  Even the most innocent and well-guarded can fall victim to the spores.  The spores destroy all that is good, right, and true. Anyway, it's amazing that people who dropped out of high school and just because they make a few movies, think they have the right to "rule" the world.  This mentality is parodied to perfection in TEAM AMERICA.  Alec Baldwin (who recently chastised his younger brother Stephen for becoming a Christian and Republican) is perhaps made fun of the most as the leader of F.A.G., but Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Michael Moore, Liv Tyler, Matt Damon, and a handful of others are also parodied.  All of the actors who actually make it into the film are people that have made political statements over the past several years, but really aren't that knowledgeable about anything.  Like the unnecessary foul language and sex scene, much of what Hollywood does is useless and pointless.<br /><br />Anyway, this isn't a movie for kids. It isn't a political movie either, making fun of two extremes on both sides. However, it is interesting that there are more conservatives who seem to enjoy the film than liberals. If you're looking for something that's crude, but hilarious and is a little different, TEAM AMERICA is for you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not Altman's best"></head><body><p>I'm a big Altman fan, and I was looking for something with his usual bite, but for some reason this film fell flat for me. Altman's usual star-studded cast re-enacts a fictional last performance of the well-known show, but it was just a bit too real to be satiric and a bit too silly to be real. Usually Altman films leave me feeling a shock of recognition--this is how life really is--messy, unfair, tragic but wonderful. "Nashville" (one of my all-time favorite films),"Short Cuts" and "The Player" come to mind. Maybe this film just felt safe and a little boring--maybe there was just too much hokey music. Maybe you have to be a fan of PHC to enjoy it--I'm not. Disappointing!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="ROBERT RODRIGUEZ, OPUS 9"></head><body><p>***1/2 2005. Directed by Robert Rodriguez. Numerous good actors for this adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novels. It's a lot more violent than BATMAN even if Basin City looks a lot like Gotham City. Recommended.</p></body></html>

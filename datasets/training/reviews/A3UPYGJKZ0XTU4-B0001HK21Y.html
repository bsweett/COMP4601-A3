Retired FBI profiler Will Graham (Edward Norton) is asked to return to the force to investigate the murders of two families, each killed on a full moon in exactly the same manner, before the killer can strike again. In order to find the murderer, nicknamed "The Tooth Fairy", Agent Graham seeks the advice of a serial killer that he put behind bars years ago, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins). The Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes) is an admirer of Dr. Lecter as well, and is simultaneously seeking his advice. Agent Graham must decipher the evidence and Dr. Lecter's ramblings in order to crack the case before the next full moon claims the lives of another family.<p>Red Dragon is the second movie adaptation of the same Thomas Harris novel. The first was a movie called Manhunter, released in 1986. So Red Dragon is in the difficult position of being compared to both a book and a movie that preceded it. I wish I could say that Red Dragon holds up well, but it doesn't. Red Dragon has but a fraction of the visual and  emotional impact that Manhunter does. It has bad screenwriting, mediocre directing, and poor casting instead. The first and most striking problem with Red Dragon is the extraordinary amount of screen time spent on things entirely extraneous to the basic plot and character development. The film really condescends to the audience by inserting several scenes that are only there to set up the next scene, as if we needed an explanation of what is going to happen before we actually see it. Presumably due to his iconic status, the character of  Hannibal Lecter is given many more scenes than the book or first movie allowed him, including a ridiculous first act that only serves to lessen our opinion of Agent Graham. Lecter's extra scenes don't contribute anything to the film except the opportunity to listen to him ramble and look at various preposterous features of the prison in which he is confined, while being distracted from the substance of the story. I found this especially annoying because I have always thought that Sir Anthony Hopkins was badly miscast as Hannibal Lecter. There are a lot more superfluous scenes in Red Dragon whose purpose I could not even guess. But all of this extraneous material prevents the film and the audience from focusing on what should be the substance of the film, and it dilutes any emotionalimpact or intellectual interest that the movie might have. <p>Red Dragon's cast is certainly impressive: Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Sir Anthony Hopkins, and in supporting roles: Philip Seymour Hoffman, Emily Watson, Mary-Louise Parker, and Harvey Keitel. I was left wondering how a film can feature so many great actors without producing one sympathetic or memorable character. I can only say by way of explanation that the characters are both badly written and badly cast. Red Dragon explores The Tooth Fairy's "Red Dragon" obsession in much greater depth than Manhunter does. In itself, that is neither good nor bad. But the character of The Tooth Fairy is so over-the-top and theatrical in Red Dragon that he is more ludicrous than frightening. And, again, too much screen time was dedicated to his histrionic antics. The more the audience sees of a villain, the less scary he seems, especially if we see that he is nutty to the point of caricature. In the film's worst example of poor character writing, Emily Watson plays the part of Reba, a blind woman in whom The Tooth Fairy seeks companionship. Reba is chatty, desperate, and generally annoying, not the bright and confident woman we know from both the book and the movie Manhunter. I find her character in Red Dragon to be a little insulting and certainly unsympathetic. Edward Norton's Will Graham is utterly lacking in depth and gives no indication whatsoever of the trauma that Lecter has caused him or of the great self-sacrifice that Graham is making when he decides to see Lecter again. Philip Seymour Hoffman sleepwalks through his performance. These are easily the worst performances of both of these actors' careers. <p>If you liked Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, you might like this film. But nothing in Red Dragon is believable -not the behavior of its characters or its knock-off gothic sets- so the movie is not affecting in any way. I strongly encourage you to see Manhunter, the first and far superior "Red Dragon" movie, and judge for yourself. Manhunter is a tightly woven film with good writing, directing, editing and casting. It is one of the best films of the serial killer genre. The characters have far greater depth. The movie has real visual impact. And Brian Cox plays Dr. Hannibal Lecter as he should be portrayed. The only reason Manhunter didn't do well at the box office is that it was released before serial killers were fashionable. Fans of Hannibal Lecter should check out Manhunter and see if you don't prefer Brian Cox's charming, seductive, and chilling Lecter to Sir Anthony Hopkins' grotesque, flippant Lecter who seems simply to be trying to put on a show all the time. I've always thought that Hopkins' Lecter was more of an attention-starved creep than a convincing criminal mastermind. If you are a fan of Thomas Harris or of murder movies, Red Dragon may be worth a rental, but Manhunter is worth owning.</p></body></html>

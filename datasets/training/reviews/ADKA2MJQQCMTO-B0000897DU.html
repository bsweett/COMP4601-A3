<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good ..."></head><body><p>You know, ... this movie really WAS like the hip-hop version of Purple Rain.  Not that that's a BAD thing per say, I liked Purple Rain; but that does explain that weird feeling of deja-vu I was getting wile watching the movie.<p>As for the movie itself, it was pretty good, I was chuckling at a couple of points though.  The movie is so close to being an autobiography that I had a hard time suspending my disbelief and realizing it was fiction.  I felt it almost turned into a parody in the moments where it was "glossed-up" (such as the scene in which Em is defending a gay co-worker).  <p>I just felt like I just kept waiting for the Slim-Shady persona to make an appearence and put an end to all the political correctness I kept seeing.</p></body></html>

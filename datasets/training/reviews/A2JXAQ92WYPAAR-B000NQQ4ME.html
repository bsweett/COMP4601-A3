That said, this film, although colorful and well-done as far as make-up and sets are concerned, is a huge disappointment. It is really the "Bourne Ultimatum" with bad acting. There is one chase after the other, lots of blood and guts, and then the happy ending. It's the worst kind of trivial Hollywood entertainment, pure Saturday afternoon cartoon dreck, but it stands out from the crowd because of the expectation created by Gibson's previous work that it might be historically interesting and perhaps even inspiring. Unfortunately, it fails at all levels, save for the extraordinary costume designs and sets which may or may not be historically accurate. Let the anthropologists work that out. For myself, it was pure nonsense from first to last and a complete waste of a real talent with the means to do virtually anything. When the Spanish arrive, we are to assume that Gibson wants to suggest that America del Sur had finally been liberated by its burden of heathen prejudice and had finally gotten the chance to discover Our Lord the Saviour. If this is true, we can say that the film does have a socially redeeming value and cannot, as a result, be defined according to the Supreme Court as pornography.</p></body></html>

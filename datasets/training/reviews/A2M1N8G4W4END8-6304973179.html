<meta name="summary" content="The Hunt Begins!  Tally-ho!"></head><body><p>1987's PREDATOR is an entertaining and suspenseful hybrid of the sci-fi, horror, and action genres that came out a few years after his phenomenal success with his roles in THE TERMINATOR and the CONAN THE BARBARIAN movies, and muscleman Arnold Schwarzenegger demonstrates here that the range of his acting skills continues to expand.  He delivers a strong performance as Major &quot;Dutch&quot; Schaeffer, the leader of a crack U.S. commando squad sent to Central America to rescue some downed airmen that have purportedly been kidnapped by terrorists.  When the mission goes awry, Dutch and crew are forced to traverse a dangerous jungle in order to reach the pre-arranged rendezvous with their OWN rescuers.  And that jungle turns out to be even more dangerous than first imagined, as the squad members soon find themselves in the midst of a safari being conducted by an intelligent extraterrestrial--and THEY are the objects of the hunt!<p>Schwarzenegger is backed by a group of outstanding supporting actors that includes Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura (yes, that's Governor Ventura), and Sonny Landham.  Considering the film's production date, the breathtaking special FX are very original and innovative, and Stan Winston's design and FX for the alien are so totally cool that the creature remains a popular SF icon today.<p>The DVD from Fox is short on extras, offering the trailer only, but the widescreen digital transfer is beautifully stunning and the Dolby Digital sound is fantastic.<p>In short, this is one of Arnie's best, especially from his earlier body of work, and the quality DVD is offered at a price that is reasonable enough that any SF or action-flick fan can add it to their collection.</p></body></html>

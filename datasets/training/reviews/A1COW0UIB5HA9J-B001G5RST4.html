<meta name="summary" content="Very good CGI comedy!"></head><body><p>In New York's Central Park Zoo, Alex The Lion (voiced by Ben Stiller) is the main star over there, his friends such as Gloria the hippo (voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith), Marty The Zebra (voiced by Chris Rock), and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer)are also the stars of the zoo. However they are caught escaping from the zoo with no choice but to go to an African zoo on a ship, four penguins take the ship hostage and makes the four animal friends get knocked off the ship and into the island of Madagascar. They befriend a tribe of Lemurs lead by King Julien (voiced by Sacha Baron Cohen) and discover that it's really a jungle out there.<br /><br />Very entertaining and funny CGI animated comedy from Dreamworks entertainment and PDI who brought you "Antz", "Shrek Trilogy", "Over the Hedge" and "Shark Tale". The also co-stars Cedric The Entertainer as the voice of Maurace the fat Lemur assitant to Julien and Andy Richter as the adorable Mort which will make audiences awww. Sure it ain't the best thing Dreamworks has ever done cause those would be "Shrek 1 & 2" and "Over The Hedge".<br /><br />This DVD has some nice extras like an audio commentary by the filmmakers and Penguins, featurettes, galleries, a short film, games and bloopers.</p></body></html>

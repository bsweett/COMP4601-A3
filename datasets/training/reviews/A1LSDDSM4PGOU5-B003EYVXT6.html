<meta name="summary" content="engaging and compelling (3.5/5)"></head><body><p>this is a tense,atmospheric,drama/sci-fi/thriller.it deals with a topical issue,one that has been done before,but it works here.the issue is one of cloning.and the ethic and moral issues involved.it's a thought provoking movie and no matter what side of the fence you're on regarding this particular issue,it should engage you.it moves at a deliberate pace in order to to keep a tense atmosphere.the acting is solid all around,but Delphine Chan&eacute;ac stands out as Dren.if you're expecting an action packed movie with lots of things blowing up,you should look elsewhere.but if you're looking for something engaging and compelling,check this one out.for me,Splice is a 3.5/5</p></body></html>

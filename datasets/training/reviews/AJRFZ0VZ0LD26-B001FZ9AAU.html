I am still unsure if the Ironman movie is based on some Ironman comic book or not, but if it is, it really does not matter.  This is why.  The cast in this film:  Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges (who you will barely recognise), Terrance Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow are amazing.  In the first 20 minutes I almost thought "where can this film possibly go from here?", but then the plot was so well thought out that you will want to see what are all these amazing characters up to.  Robert Downey Jr. plays the Ironman, a gifted scientist who inherits his father's weapons making corporation only to learn that it is time to grow up and take a responsibility for the damage that weapons can do not just to the rest of the world but also to the americans themselves.  He is indulgent, overconfident, rich but stilll likable.  A kind of a bad boy only Downey Jr. can profile.  Several comic parts are so memorable because Downey Jr. is such a gifted actor that no matter how much bad press he can get about his personal conduct in his personal life we still love him, adore his talent and those dark piercing eyes of his.  I actuallly really like this action movie where the main character does not have to be another muscle but can charm us with his sense of humor, genuine smartness and charisma.  Robert Downey Jr. is all of that.  Enjoy! Oh, and if there is another Ironman movie coming out, I will want to be the first one to see it.</p></body></html>

The story is long and thin, and by the time it gets to the end, I forgot what the significance was supposed to be.  The camera work was very stylistic and artsy, but that does not make up for just a plain poor story.  This is supposed to be a story about two ex boxers who make detective rank, and then become obscessed with horrific murder of a young woman. That ends up being one of many sub plots which just tie this story into one giant tangle of weak, uniteresting plots that I did not care to find out one way or another about.  Save your money, let others watch this for you, and give you a synopsis later</p></body></html>

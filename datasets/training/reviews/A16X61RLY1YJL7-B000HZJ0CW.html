<meta name="summary" content="Star Trek Nemesis - A generation's final journey...?"></head><body><p>Not unlike many Star Trek fans, when I went and saw Star Trek Nemesis at the theater the first time, I was a little blanched by it because it seemed to be a disappointment based on four years of anticipation and all the hype leading up to its release.  Upon a second viewing at the theater a couple weeks thereafter I warmed up to this tale a little more.  And now we finally have the DVD where a third viewing for me has clinched this as one of the better Star Trek movies.  Paramount has finally decided to not put the screws to us once again by releasing a DVD with just the movie and a trailer; they have loaded this one down with as much as possible.<p>Many fans have made reference to the writer John Logan who wrote "Gladiator" and someone who has been a long time fan of Star Trek that he embedded this film with way too many references to previously filmed scenes.  While this may be the case, I do not think it detracts from the film in any way.  Overall, I believe John Logan, Rick Berman and Brent Spiner who are all credited with writing this trek tale, did a wonderful job of dealing with the particular issues that they wanted included and tossing in some of the best Star Trek silver screen space battles ever done.<p>Credits to of course the entire Star Trek The Next Generation's cast for their usual high standard performances and to Tom Hardy for his wonderful performance as Shinzon of Remus.  We're even treated to a guest performance by none other than Kate Mulgrew as "Admiral" Janeway, which leaves many a Star Trek fan to wonder where Voyager will lead to in the future...<p>The premise:<p>Going into this film, the Executive Producer of Star Trek Rick Berman knew there were particular aspects that they had to include in this film as part of the premise that this would be "A Generation's Final Journey," which they did quite well to include leaving a huge possibility at the end of the film for this to "not" be STNG's final journey on the silver screen.<p>Shinzon of Remus, The Romulan Empires second and closest planet has managed to overthrow the Romulan Senate to include the Praetor and is now its Praetor.  Having ties with Captain Jean Luc Picard and a need to meet him, he sets into motion a plan that will draw the Federations flagship and her Captain to Romulus for a fateful meeting that will possibly herald the destruction of Earth and the Federation.<p>The DVD:<p>As referenced above, Paramount really outdid themselves with this particular release.  In past Star Trek film DVD releases we've received only the film and a trailer or two and for the past year or so they've finally been re-releasing the films as "Special Editions."<p>The cover art for the DVD is perfect.  In addition to the wonderful cover art the DVD case itself is new and different as well, with two clips for keeping the case closed which is fairly innovative!<p>The on screen menus for this DVD are nothing short of spectacular and probably the best I've seen so far for a Star Trek DVD.<p>Special Features:<p>Commentary by Director Stuart Baird<br />Exclusive Documentaries:<br /> - New Frontiers:  Stuart Baird on Directing "Nemesis"<br /> - A Bold Vision of the Final Frontier<br /> - A Star Trek Family's Final Journey<br /> - Red Alert!  Shooting the Action of "Nemesis"<br />Deleted Scenes<br />Photo Gallery<br />Previews - The wonderful preview for the release of all seven seasons of DS9 on DVD.<p>I highly recommend this DVD to all fans, hard core or casual and that they give this film a second look as it truly is a wonderful addition to the Star Trek film library!  {ssintrepid}</p></body></html>

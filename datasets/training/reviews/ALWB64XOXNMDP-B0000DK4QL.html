<meta name="summary" content="Frank Miller's Daredevil makes it to the screen!"></head><body><p>I was wondering how long it would take to see Frank Miller's version of Daredevil to become a major motion picture.  Although some things have been changed and Bullseye has no costume it's a very good film.  It is more realistic than Spiderman and I'd like to say much better. I think this would make a great TV series because DD fights contemporary criminals like the Kingpin and other parasites of society.  Let's hope we see them again in some type of series.  Daredevil like Spiderman deserves a sequel.</p></body></html>

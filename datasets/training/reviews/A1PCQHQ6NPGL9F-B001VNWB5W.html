<meta name="summary" content="Just not a good movie."></head><body><p>I was expecting an awesome superhero movie. Some of my friends went to see it and weren't sure how they felt about it. I know now... it sucked.<br /><br />I can't think of many things I liked. I read a little bit of the comic so I could see the comparisons, and the story follows the comic closely. However, the story doesn't play out on the screen as it is essentially not very exciting. There is so much down time in the movie. The action scenes are not choreographed well. Most of them are over WAY too quickly. In a movie that runs nearly 3 hours, there are maybe 30 minutes of action at most. While I don't mind a lot of talking in a movie, all of the talking seems to have no point.<br /><br />The characters also didn't speak to me. Rorschach is a good hero and fleshed out well in the film, but after the movie was over I didn't really have much interest in him anymore. Dr. Manhattan is better done in my opinion. His monologue near the end is performed very well, and while I hated his monotone voice, I felt like it was appropriate to the character. All of the other characters just seemed like they were trying too hard to act. Maybe its just me, but I really couldn't stand most of them.<br /><br />I was bored for the entire length of the movie. Nothing thrilled me. If you have never read the comics, I would skip it, as it isn't a good movie.</p></body></html>

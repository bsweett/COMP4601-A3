<meta name="summary" content="STUPENDOUS"></head><body><p>I'm bleary-eyed but exhilarated after watching over 50 hours of the stupendous ALIEN QUADRILOGY (Fox). A steal at even the suggested retail price, this extraordinary 9 disc set is a crowning achievement in the art of DVD authoring, assembly and presentation. <p>Encountering Swiss artist Giger's "mechorganic" demon in dark, labyrinthine, quarters far, far from home or help can still jolt our deepest fears of the unknown. <p>All four titles in the series are presented in both theatrical and or extended versions.  Besides commentaries, there's a huge treasure trove preproduction, production and postproduction extras.  <p>Although the sequels don't have the freshness Ridley Scott's 1979 ALIEN that began the series, Weaver delivers increasingly nuanced and intense performances as the storyline evolves.  <p>I especially enjoyed the much longer (over 40 minutes) restored work print of ALIEN 3.  Space does not allow for even the most simplistic listing of all the extras. You'll be astounded, it's graduate level film school in a box.  Highest recommendation.</p></body></html>

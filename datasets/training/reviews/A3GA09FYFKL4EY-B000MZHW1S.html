<meta name="summary" content="Gripping Adventure"></head><body><p>This is the best movie of its kind that I've seen since "The Constant Gardener." The premise is similar....corporate greed trumps human decency.<br /><br />Leonardo diCaprio gives his best performance ever as a gem smuggler, along with Djimon Hounsou as father desperate to reunite his war-torn family.<br /><br />Drama will keep you on your edge of your seat, as well as the heartwrenching story of children ripped from families and forced to become soldiers, innocent people maimed and killed in the name of "revolution" and of course the infuriating unconcern of those whose only goal is for profit. I'll never buy another diamond unless I can be certain it didn't come from a country torn by war.</p></body></html>

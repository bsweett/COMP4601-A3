<meta name="summary" content="Eragon"></head><body><p>Having not read the books I came to this film with an open mind and although it's not amazing, it is a pretty decent medieval type fantasy adventure. Following Eragon as he acquires a Dragon egg and subsequently learns to be a Dragon Rider, this film has plenty of CGI animation and sword fights. Eragon has to fight to rid the lands of an evil king and his tyrannical rule and battles against a shade (or wizard to you and me) in the form of Robert Carlyle. All in all this is pretty standard fantasy film fare, with nothing highly original or earthshaking. The effects are good and the story, although lack lustre, manages to keep you watching. I'm inclined to feel if it was much longer I'd be getting bored though. The cast is sadly underused and Jeremy Irons and Malkovich could deliver so much more. If you like fantasy type films then you'll probably enjoy this, even if you've enjoyed better examples of the genre in the past and if you don't watch many then this will still provide a couple hours of light entertainment where you don't have to think too hard. From reading other reviews you may enjoy this more if you haven't read the books! Good but not great.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

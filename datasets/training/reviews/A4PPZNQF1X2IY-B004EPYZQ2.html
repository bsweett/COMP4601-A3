<meta name="summary" content="excellent, one of the years best"></head><body><p>the first 75 minutes was a tour de force, excellent film-making!  the end got a little predictable and sentimental, but still good.<br /><br />yes, it's a homage to earlier spielberg movies, especially ET, and a little close encounters.  still, the script is outstanding, funny, and heartfelt.  the kids are excellent and clever in a realistic way.  born in the 70s myself, a little nostalgia is always welcome (i can remember when i painted action/fantasy figures too/model trains... the days before video games and internet!!!!)<br /><br />thumbs up !!</p></body></html>

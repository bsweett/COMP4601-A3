<meta name="summary" content="Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"></head><body><p>Disney has gotten a whole lot of mileage out of the Pirates franchise, considering it's based on one of its amusement park rides, and this fourth installment would test the true star power of not only its lead actor, Johnny Depp, but the saucy, wisecracking Jack Sparrow. How so? Well, with On Stranger Tides, Depp would have to make a go of it without three-time co-stars Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, as well as director Gore Verbinski, who had also helmed all three previous films. No, this time around, Jack Sparrow would have to contend with Angelica, a woman from his past who may be out to con him, and the fearsome pirate Blackbeard in a Rob Marshall-directed quest to discover the Fountain of Youth. As it turns out, On Stranger Tides is the worst of all the Pirates films, and it made the least amount of money at the box office, but when you consider the performance of the first three installments, which all had diminishing box office returns and got progressively worse, it's not quite so bad. Despite its jumbled plot and overabundance of noisy action sequences, Pirates 4 still earned a worldwide sum of over $1 billion, so if all you needed was a little more Jack Sparrow, this will suit you just fine.</p></body></html>

Conceived as a sequel to the Original Series episode &quot;Space Seed&quot;, The Wrath of Khan is a story about the adventures of Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Captain Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and the rest of the Enterprise crew as they attempt to stop genetically engineered 20th-Century madman Khan (played by the ever-delightful Ricardo Montalban) from using a stolen top-secret device called Project Genesis to ignite universal Armageddon in his quest for revenge against Kirk.<p>The thing I enjoyed most about the Director's Edition was the inclusion of several scenes that had been filmed for the movie, but which were cut in the theatrical release.  One of these is a scene between Kirk and Peter Preston (Ike Eisenmann) that serves to define the relationship between Preston and Scotty (James Doohan).  While it was ultimately deemed unnecessary to the plot, it helped clarify certain reactions from Scotty later in the film.  There are also some extended scenes with Dr. Carol Marcus (played by the late Bibi Besch), her son David (the late Merritt Butrick), and the crew of Space Station Regula One which serve a similar purpose.<p>I also liked the fact that the Director's Edition had enough extras to warrant the inclusion of a second disc, which is a rarity from Paramount.  The Feature disc has a spoken commentary by director Nicholas Meyer (while I'm not normally a fan of these types of commentaries because they distract me, I enjoyed hearing what Meyer had to say about the film) and a text commentary by Star Trek Encyclopedia author Michael Okuda.  The Special Features disc includes some very insightful interviews with Meyer, Shatner, Nimoy, Montalban, and writer/Executive Producer Harve Bennett, as well as two featurettes (Designing Khan and The Visual Effects of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan), original interviews with Shatner, Nimoy, Montalban, and the late DeForest Kelley, and plenty more.  For those who have enjoyed Star Trek as long as I have, this DVD set is definitely a keeper.</p></body></html>

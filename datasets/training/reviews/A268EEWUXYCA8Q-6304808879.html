<meta name="summary" content="Great story, lousy execution"></head><body><p>I hate using a star system to rate things.  People skim over them, without reading the actual review a lot and think a 3 star is a bad movie.  Its not.  And Hellraiser isn't a bad movie.  I don't think its a terrific film, but its interesting.<br /><br />The story behind Hellraiser and the mythology therein is extremely involved and interesting.  I was genuinely intrigued and interested the entire way through.  However, the acting was atrocious.  It made scenes that probably were supposed to be moving and/or scary hillarious.  It was over-the-top and maudelin and really kept me at arms length.<br /><br />Of course, this is a 1980s horror film and relies on puppetry, much like the amazing The Thing.  I can look past technical effects on films and they usually don't bother me, mostly because I can see them within context of the time and appreciate the skill going into it.  But when a puppet monster is chasing Kristy down a dark hallway and you can not only see the cart the monster is resting on but the people pushing the cart, I have a problem.<br /><br />Again, the story is quite interesting and dark.  The gore level is high, but it has a good story on which to sit on, unlike some other gore films.  It fits within the construct.  I'm very interested in seeing the second film in the series as it continues the story, much like Halloween 2.  If you can look past the technical deficiencies and the very laden and melodramatic acting, its an interesting story.</p></body></html>

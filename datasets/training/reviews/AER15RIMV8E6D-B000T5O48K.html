<meta name="summary" content="A Really Messed Up Movie!!!"></head><body><p>This movie is messed up. About a woman named Agnes who tries to get away from her ex-husband and ends up falling in love with a psychopath named Peter. Peter thinks there are tiny little bugs in the room and in their skin, pulling Agnes into his crazy thoughts. They begin to think it's a conspiracy against them and Peter makes Agnes think about suicide to get themselves away from the bugs. At least there is a pretty good sex scene. If you like messed up movies, you might like BUG!!!</p></body></html>

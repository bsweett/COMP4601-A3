Although I am a fan of open-wheel Indy car and Grand Prix racing, not NASCAR, it was a hoot following Paul Newman's character, a crusty retired former champion car. I think the movie is over the heads of most kids Brianna's age, and a bit too long for anyone younger, but its failures are minor compared to its achievements. It teaches lessons in humility and in perserverance and in the rewards of doing the right thing even if it costs you something you really want.</p></body></html>

This film was doomed from the start with an ill-suited director, a horrible screenplay, a poor script, senseless editing, bad casting, and mediocre acting by most of the main actors.<br /><br />Oliver Stone was probably the worst choice for an epic historical film as Stone's specialty lies exclusively in the relatively narrow domain of the post-1960s Americana genre.  Stone's greatest talent in direction is with themes reflecting the pop-culture and post-modernist American values found in "Platoon", "JFK", "Nixon", or "Natural Born Killers", but not historical epics such as the life and times of Alexander The Great.  Stone's closest attempt at filming a historical epic was with "Conan The Barbarian" and, because of his inability to competently direct such films, he was quickly reduced to a minimal role by John Milius who took full direction to save the film from certain doom.  In addition to wasting film on simply non-sequential scenes for "Conan", Stone actually wanted to use disco for the theme music and Milius ardently insisted on hiring Basil Poledoris to compose the memorable score.  In the case of Alexander, Stone's rather narrow direction skills led to a completely incoherent theme emphasizing on Alexander's homosexuality as being a significant factor to his greatness when it actually wasn't.  As a result, the audience is left with a long film showing Alexander as the hip post-modern psychadelic leader whose main motive for conquering the world was to overcome his insecurity of being gay and spread his gay rights agenda to a desperate and intolerant world.<br /><br />Stone's emphasis on Alexander's bisexual orientation was simply a wasted opportunity and an inappropriate thematic emphasis as Alexander's motives and achievements had little to do with being bisexual.  Actually, Alexander did not like sexual intercourse at all regardless of whether a man or woman was in his bed.  Stone presents Alexander as a sobbing and confused gay sentimentalist in desperate need for his mother's approval and more concerned about his uncertain relationship with Hephaestion's companioship than with conquering the world.  Although Alexander did have a troubled relationship with Olympias, he was hardly the little insecure boy always coming back to his mother as portrayed by Stone and the film wastes too much time on developing their relationship.  Alexander was all too happy to leave his overly ambitious mother behind and to never see her again after he set off to conquer Persia: their relationship was therefore moot after that point whereas Stone falsely portrays it as an ongoing issue.  This was hardly the case as Alexander was probably the most confident leader in history who knew exactly what he wanted from an early age: to be king of Greece and conquer the world!  This is why Phillip told him when he was young, "My son, ask for yourself another kingdom for that which I leave is too small for thee!"  In contrast to Stone's distorted depiction, Alexander's motivations for conquering Persia where essentially the same as Phillips which were to, (1) keep the Greek city-states busy fighting the Persians instead of themselves or Macedonia; (2) to control the vastest economic empire in ancient history by taking its treasures and trade routes; and, (3) to take revenge on Persia for their burning of Athens a century before.  The only difference between Alexander and Phillip is that Alexander rejoiced in the thrill of battle, conquest, and exploration a lot more than Phillip's pragmatic approach to politics and diplomacy reflected by his proverbial statement, "Treat boys with fists and men with oaths!"  Alexander was never really interested in the pragmatic administration of the State and was more than happy to squander his treasures to continue his campaigns of conquest and exploration to the end of the then known world.  Another poor depiction of Alexander by Stone is that of his relationship with Roxeanne.  Stone portrays Roxeanne as Alexander's first wife and of great importance when in fact she was his third wife and the least important of the three.  Alexander married Roxeanne for purely pragmatic reasons and took her more as a hostage than a regal spouse who was to provide an heir to rule his entire kingdom.  Alexander's military resources were being bogged down in Bactria by petty mountain tribes who were carrying out somewhat succesful guerrilla operations against Alexander's forces.  Roxeanne was the daughter of the strongest chieftain in Bactria and so he took her as a bride/hostage to assure her father's good behavior while Alexander went East to conquer India.  Alexander impregnated Roxeanne so that he could in the future establish a direct bloodline to rule that difficult province instead of relying on the whims of local chieftains who had limited alliegiance to him.  The most absurd part in the film is where Alexander is intimidated by Roxeanne and cowers before her like a little boy.  Alexander intimidated!?  I doubt he would have been considered great if that had been true as there would be nothing more disgraceful in that time for a Greek man to cower before a woman of virtually insignificant lineage and a barbarian one to boot.  Please! The film also fails to capture Alexander's genius and grandeur by including his cutting of the Gordion Knot and his crowning as pharao after his visit to Siwa. The plot and theme of this film is also further diluted by failing to develop the perspective of the Persians and Darius III.  The film essentially has no antagonists and therfore no climactic tension to hold any suspense worth speaking of.  In short, the film getting bogged down in Stone's emphasis on Alexander's sexuality completely brushed over these crucial aspects of Alexander's true character and motives as well as the environment he found himself in.  As a result, the audience is left yawning in boredom watching a sobbing and overly gay Alexander who cowered before the women in his life and went conquering the world for self-esteem and to propagate his (or rather Stone's) post-modernist liberal agenda.  It is quite unlikely that Stone's Alexander would have been able to last even a month in leading a vast army of hardened veterans with such a weak personality not to speak of 13 years.<br /><br />The casting was also poor in the making of this film.  Farrel simply had too little charisma and acting talent to portray Alexander as even the great Richard Burton couldn't pull it off fifty years before in Rossen's film.  In addition, Stone's pointless direction along with the already defective screenplay and defective script utterly ruined any chance for Farrel to act the part of Alexander in a convincing way.  Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer pulled it off best even though Jolie's awkward accent tended to come off more as overacting by an actress who is insecure about her role.  Rosario Dawson was also a terrible casting decision for Roxeanne as the real Roxeanne was caucasian and not black/mulato.  She was also considered to be the most beautiful woman in the world after the women in Darius' family.  Although Dawson is relatively attractive, among the many gorgeous actresses who could have played the part she is certainly not one who generally invokes the sense of being the most beautiful woman in the world by any contemporary standard.  One of the worst performances surprisingly was that of Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy whose monotonous narrative cries out "God! When will I be done with this horrible script!" throughout the entire film.<br /><br />Stone limiting Alexander's campaign to just the battles of Gaugamela and Jehlum also didn't justice to the greatness of Alexander who never lost a major battle in his entire military career.  Every conqueror or general who came after him from Caesar to Schwarzkopff felt only disappointment at not being able to come even close to his military greatness.  The battle of Gaugamela is abruptly introduced without showing how Alexander got there after brilliantly defeating Persia at Granicus or Issus.  The film simply shifts from Ptolemy's boring narrative to a bird's eye view of the battle field that illuminates nothing as to Alexander's courage and brilliant tactics. The scenes are nothing but senseless phallanx and cavalry deployments giving the audience no idea as to what is happening on the battle field or what Alexander really did to win the battle.  The depiction of Jehlum was even worse as the battle did not take place in a dense jungle but in a large clearing in the semi arid region of the Indus valley in modern-day Pakistan.  A phallanx formation and cavalry tactics would have been utterly useless in a dense jungle environment and any army using such tactics against Porus' elephants and nimble infantry would have been completely crushed.  As with Gaugamela, what won the battle of Jehlum was Alexander's brilliant use of cavalry outmaneuver Porus' elephants and infantry.  Furthermore, Alexander was not pierce by an arrow in that battle nor did he lose his prized horse Baucephalus: both these events had already taken place previously before he advanced into India.  Stone fails to depict Alexander's brilliant victories and Granicus and Issus and no film has bothered to show his siege of Tyre where he sacked the island citadel with two 3/4 mile jettis that his men built in less than 6 months by sheer herculean effort. The film also falsely portrays Alexander as receiving Darius family for the first time in Babylon when he had actually taken them hostage after the battle of Issus.<br /><br />This was simply a terrible depiction of Alexander The Great's life in which Stone wasted the entire theme and plot to show how Alexander being gay as a significant factor to his greatness when it wasn't.  Alexander's youthful energy, godlike self-confidence, and sheer military genius were the main factors contributing to his greatness and not his homosexuality.  That is why Alexander is called "The Great" and not "The Gay."  In truth, I don't think any film medium short of an extended miniseries to the likes of HBO's "Rome" would do justice to the complexities of Alexander's character or the impact he actually made on Western civilization and the rest of the world.  To paraphrase Phillip's advice to Alexander, I would tell the audience to go and seek a better film of Alexander for that which Rossen and Stone have left is too mediocre to watch.</p></body></html>

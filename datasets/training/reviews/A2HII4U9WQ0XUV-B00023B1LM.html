<meta name="summary" content="The Perfect Spy"></head><body><p>Have you ever seen a movie that was so astoundingly cool, so effortless, so neatly, wonderfully hip, that you wondered why other movie studios didn't somehow find a way to copy its ingredients and bottle it up, maybe weaponize it, releasing into the atmosphere every time they needed a blockbuster?<br /><br />"The Bourne Identity" is that kind of movie.<br /><br />Director Doug Liman has taken all of the hyperkinetic and insanely cool techniques he used in the stylish "Go", and translated it over to the espionage genre, playing with the story of Robert Ludlum's best-selling "The Bourne Identity" to create a lightning-paced, sleek, intelligent and absorbing little spy-hunt that manages to out-Bond Bond himself and parallels (and nearly surpasses)Sydney Pollack's white-knuckled thriller "Three Days of the Condor."<br /><br />In many ways, the story in "Bourne" is very close to "Condor": a confused protagonist and his reluctant companion find themselves pursued by a relentless, mysterious and deadly foe. When we first meet up with the movie's nameless protagonist (played masterfully by Matt Damon, who is becoming one of those actor who can charm the camera merely by sleeping---which, in fact, he does in this film)he is clad in a wetsuit, drifing unconscious in the ocean.<br /><br />He is picked up by a Portuguese fishing trawler and discovers he was 60 miles off the coast of Marseilles in the Mediterranean, but how he came there is a mystery. Indeed, everything is a mystery to our hero, for he has amnesia: he can't even remember his own name.<br /><br />He does remember a lot of other things, though: he discovers he can speak German, French, Italian, and Portuguese fluently; he can disarm and subdue two policemen in seconds; he knows how to drive a Mini Cooper *very* offensively; and he's a natural at staking out the opposition. Oh, and he has a laserlight pointer embedded in his hip, with the address of a Zurich bank and a numbered Swiss bank account.<br /><br />A trip to Zurich raises more questions than answers though, as Damon finds a bank-box with a slew of fake passports (one of which has the name "Jason Bourne", his picture, and his 'residence' in Paris), a bundle of money in different denominations, and a gun. Worse still, he has now raised the attention of the police, and is now pursued by them and a series of well-trained and motivated killers who want Bourne dead.<br /><br />To say anything more would spoil the fun of "Bourne", but it is rousingly well paced and intelligently directed. In a sense, "Bourne" is more Bondian than the Bond films, which are slick productions but often try too hard. "Bourne" also boasts excellent acting all around: Damon is great as a man literally searching for his identity while struggling for his very survival, Brian Cox racks up his third great character performance in a year (including his role as General Stryker in "X-Men 2" and his performance in "The Ring"), and Chris Cooper is excellent as a CIA spook.<br /><br />And then there is Franka Potente, one of the most beautiful women in film today, who was the white hot core of the eclectic "Run Lola Run." Potente, who plays a gypsy who helps Bourne, works perfectly with Damon, and the two have great chemistry together. Potente can say more with a quirk of her mouth and a single look than most actresses can with 5 pages of script.<br /><br />The movie has everything you would want from a spy film: good villains, thrilling fight sequences, and a ripping chase through the streets of Paris in a vintage, beat up Mini Cooper. But best of all is Liman's ability to create a very real sense of menace and danger that is ratcheted up with every passing minute. Liman is very good at crafting this mounting atmosphere of peril, and shares much in common with Ridley Scott, particularly a solid feel for juicing up the danger-factor of otherwise innocnet locales.<br /><br />Spymaster John Le Carre once wrote a book called "The Perfect Spy". In praise of Doug Liman, "The Bourne Identity" is The Perfect Spy Movie.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

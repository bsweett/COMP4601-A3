<meta name="summary" content="Great Opening Sequence, but Falls Flat"></head><body><p>Yes, the title sequence at the beginning of &quot;Goldmember&quot; is al all star classic, with cameos by Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Steven Speilberg, Danny DiVito and many others offering a laugh-out-loud 10 minutes.  But after that, &quot;Goldmember&quot; is a hodge-podge of uninspired and been-there-done-that dialogue from the great Mike Meyers.  I'd really hoped for a more lively episode, along the lines of the first two movies, and was clearly disappointed.  Beyonce Knowles - GORGEOUS HERE - is solid as Foxy Cleopatra, but the rest of the cast seems like they are just going through the motions.  Even Meyers himself seems to be channeling SNL characters rather than focusing on making this funny.  Let's hope the next Austin Powers movie finds him back in real fine shape, bay-bee.</p></body></html>

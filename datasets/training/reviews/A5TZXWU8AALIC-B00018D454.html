It makes for a nice ad campaign, but too many people have no idea what they're talking about.<p>THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and PSYCHO are both based on the same case: Ed Gein, a mild-mannered maniac in Wisconsin who dug up bodies and made skin suits out of them.  He also did some creative things with body parts and his furniture.  They found an old woman hung upside down and draining into a bucket in his barn (while he was having dinner with a family down the road!).  Not in Texas, no superhot girls like Jessica Beil bouncing around in terror, no conspiracy of backroad inbreds.<p>I always liked the original.  Something about the low-budget look gave it a gruesome authenticity.  The claustrophobic madness of that goofy family in the original also really works.<p>This new version doesn't expand on anything from the original and, although slickly produced, it could have been any of the forgettable &quot;sequels&quot; that have come out over the years.  CHAINSAW basically becomes just another slasher flick.  I did like that they got John LaRoquette to do the lead-in narration--as he did in the original, but that's about it.  R. Lee Ermey's always fun.<br />I thought having Jessica Beil dispatch one of her friends since he'd been relieved of a limb was a weird choice (I would've like that character better if he'd wanted to use his final breaths fighting back against the hillbilly cannibals), even as I kept getting hit over the head with a Meat Is Murder subtext.  At least the movie didn't end with &quot;One Tin Soldier&quot; or some lame anti-meat folk song.<p>I wanted to like it, but it's just another modern studio horror movie: no discernible artist voice/value, corporate product, etc.</p></body></html>

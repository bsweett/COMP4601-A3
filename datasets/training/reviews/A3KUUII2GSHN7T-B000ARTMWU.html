<meta name="summary" content="Was that Gollum in the first van scene? I need to vomit."></head><body><p>Man oh hairy man, this film was quite the dandy. I felt like I was watching a snuff film with a weird soundtrack. Here are the highs and lows of this film.<br /><br />First twenty minutes: I laughed till I peed - literally, I think some natural lemondade made its way down my leg. The soundtrack was beyond the point of nonsensical and the dialogue made me want to beat myself in hilarity. Seriously. You could smell the cheese of its cheesiness in each scene. Then came the second twenty-minutes. I think Gollum makes an appearance in the opening van scene. It sure sounds like him. When you see what Gollum is doing, you might have a whole new outlook on the Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />BOO! We get our lesbo scene - I hate lesbo scenes: well, it actually only involves one person. If this was meant to be sensual, they thought wrong. I almost puked up my frosted flakes. The weird part is, they drag it on FOREVER. I found myself contemplating walking out and began looking at the floor as opposed to our young lady - it was that disgusting - and I like women - but me no likey that type of thing - no, siree.<br /><br />Now onto the home invasion: Let's just say I'm going to have to watch It's a Wondeful Life five or six times in a row just to get those scenes out of my mind. The killer cuts and shoots, stabs and slashes his merry little heart out. I tried to make it less than it was, but guys, this was cruel. Even the little boy who once says, "I want to be a cowboy" (which was funny), finds out that the cowboy life ain't for him when the deranged psychopath chases him down with a shotgun through a cornfield(actually, that part was funny too!!). The death scenes are quite chilling and I wouldn't recommend this film to Hitler if he asked me what films would fit his preferred taste.<br /><br />I need to take a shower just thinking about this film. I repented of my terrible crime. Despite what the critics are saying, this is not a chick romance, guys! Someone said it was a lot like the Wedding Planner but they were WRONG, unless they meant, The Wedding in Hell Planner.<br /><br />Don't watch this. I know you're going to anyway, just to be like the bratty little kid who does things just because he's not supposed to, but these scenes are not wholesome. They demoralize your soul. Scratch that, they take a 12-gauge and blast a whole through your soul's forehead, plastering the walls with soul juice. You see, this film's already having an affect on me!!!!<br /><br />GET IT OUT OF MY HEAD, DAAAAAAAADDY!!!!<br /><br />Oh yeah, and the ending is pathetic. Those French thought they got us but Chubby Checkers makes a better "twist", guys. Two thumbs, and an extra, mutated thumb down.</p></body></html>

Aside from that false judgement, I was biased against the movie because of the era in which it was made. As a classic film fan, it is sometimes difficult not to resent some of the films that helped Hollywood progress away from the traditions of the classic era. However, any way you look at this movie, it is hard not to recognize the quality of the story and of the actors' performances.<br /><br />One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a film about a man Randle (Jack Nicholson) who is sent to a mental institution to be evaluated because of his behavior in jail. The doctors think he could be faking insanity in order to avoid the rest of his jail time, but he keeps them guessing with strange behavior. Randle becomes friends with the men in the ward, a diverse group including a young man with a stutter named Brad Dourif (Billy Bibbit), a deaf and dumb Indian called Chief (Will Sampson), a rigid man named Harding (William Redfield), and a hyperactive Italian called Martini (Danny deVito). Randle helps these men to fight back against the abusive power of the nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) causing trouble for everyone but giving them a sense of idenity and happiness.<br /><br />This is a long film, but it is very emotional and powerful. Nicholson makes his character likable but appropriately flawed. Dourif presents his character innocently and sweetly like a little brother one needs to protect. Sampson is excellent as the Chief, one of the most interesting characters in the film. The ending to the movie is unsettling and sad, but it is thought-provoking and a wonderful finish to this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Adams To Carell:Missed It By THAT Much....."></head><body><p>Being a TV obsessed kid in the mid 70's, my afternoons were usually filled with syndicated shows of the decade before. One of those shows that caught my eye was Get Smart. Started in 1965, this was a spy comedy as USA's answer to James Bond but with a comedic flair. Don Adams played Maxwell "Agent 86" Smart, a bumbling yet charismatic spy working for the secret organization Control in the fight against Kaos, the Russian Cold War equivalent. Surrounded by a cast of equally interesting characters including his younger, more competent female partner Agent 99 and his always frustrated in Max's foolishness boss The Chief. Get Smart was a mix of old-school spy tricks and gadgets with good word-play humor.<br /><br />Now flashing forward over forty-five years later, the Hollywood remake machine once again dips into it's pockets and pulls out yet another classic for, to put it kindly, modernization. But with today's technology in special effects, can a new team of actors bring back these spies to a world where the Cold War is a forgotten memory?<br /><br />Just looking at the new cast, you can tell that visually director Peter "50 First Dates" Segal wanted to preserve and respect the original cast in that aspect, and does so very well. Just looking at Steve Carell's resemblance to Don Adams is uncanny, and with Anne Hathaway (who's career is a bit too big now for a role like this) as Agent 99 and Alan Arkin as The Chief, you'd be hard-pressed to think of any other actor in these roles today. But one thing noticable to fans of the old series to this film will be that even though they look like the originals, acting-wise they're nowhere near close. Carell's Smart is downright dead-panned completely ignoring the standards set by Adams. Once funny lines like "Would you believe..." and "Missed it by that much" out of Carell's mouth lack any humor or flair that Adams gave them week after week. Agent 99 now seems cold and calculated lacking any of the warmth Barbara Feldon originally gave her. And as for The Chief, well he now acts like, well, Alan Arkin, instead of depressingly frustrated with 86's antics, he's angry and hot-headed to the point of violence. Add in new cast members like over-acting Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson as Agent 23, Max's rival and mentor, and nerdy tech guys Bruce & Lloyd (who during the production of this film made a spin-off film of their very own), something is very missing in this remake. Simply put, this 2008 production is just too weak as a modern day spy film and not funny enough to be a successful comedic parody. It sort of lays flat, playing out as a reminder of how great and entertaining the original 60's show was. Sure, the Russian scenes are nice (be it I doubt they were really there on set), a couple of the gadgets have a tad of laughs, and the cameos by some famous faces are cool to see, overall this film should land in the "forgotten remake pile" with copies of I-Spy, My Favorite Martian, and The Wild, Wild West.<br /><br />As for the disc itself, you can imagine the video/audio quality which is satisfactory for a 2008 film, but my review on the single-disc here should note you don't get much with just one. The only special feature here is an option to see the film in an "Expanded 62% More Laughs" version with an introduction by Carell. With it, you can see different takes and versions of scenes that already are in the film. However, with this process on other discs instead of a small icon appearing at the bottom corner of your screen, a Flash-like animation takes up the entire picture screaming at you to hit your "Enter" button now, and after four or five of these it gets extremely irritating. No wonder they gave this only 62%, because each alternate take explains why they weren't good enough to make the final cut. The Two-Disc does offer more behind the scenes, but at the cost I doubt they would be worth it when the movie itself isn't really rewatchable.<br /><br />In the end, I can only suggest this to die-hard fans of the original series, as newbies to the franchise will find this too typical and not funny enough. And each true fan should realize that one of the movie's best accomplishments is that it was made after Don Adams' passing, so he couldn't call Carell on his shoe and say "Missed it by that much".<br />(RedSabbath Rating:6.0/10)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="In tribute to Isaac Asimov....."></head><body><p>This is, in short, perhaps the greatest movie that deals with Artificial Intelligence there ever was.  All of the usual motifs are there (robots yearning to become human, etc) but the film has a sufficient number of twists and turns to deliver a story that is both familiar and fresh at the same time.<br /><br />While I've never been a huge fan of Will Smith, he has starred in several fabulous movies.  This is one of them.  To his credit, he plays his role with convincing authority and also demonstrates a vulnerability altogether missing from most previous roles.<br /><br />If you're a fan of CGI special effects, this is an absolute for your DVD collection.  However, the best news is that there is much more TO this film than the eye-candy effects!  That's something pretty rare to see in a high-budget FX film in this day & age.  As a matter of fact, I would argue that this film would STILL be worth seeing even if (hypothetically) it was made with 1960s technology.  However, for your FX fans out there, you can relax.  The FX this film has are nothing short of stunning.<br /><br />So, if you're into action films, sci-fi, AI or cerebral films you will find something in the present film to like.  If you don't, then I'm not sure what could possibly please your cinematic appetite!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Still Funny with Less Magic"></head><body><p>Although by the third movie most sequels are finding it hard to keep the magic. Shrek is no different. Amusing story, good animation, and another round of the characters we enjoy. This time Prince Charming is looking for payback and enlists the bad guys and gals from all the fairytales to help him. While Shrek is off looking for Arthur "Arty" Penndragon to take over a kings crown he doesn't want, the castle is invaded by Charming. All the fairytale ladies have to break out of the tower and give a nice fight sequence, but are recaptured. Shrek returns and with the help of Arty, saves the day. My only complaint is they put way to much time into sophomoric characterizations in the extras about the kids at Arty's high school where Shrek found him. A little is nice, but it went way beyond little. Nonetheless it is a nice addition to the other two movies. Great DVD quality and enough extras to make you sick of them.</p></body></html>

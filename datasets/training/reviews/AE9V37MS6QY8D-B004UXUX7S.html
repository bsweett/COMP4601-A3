<meta name="summary" content="Clooney and company are superb!"></head><body><p>I didn't really expect this to be noticeably good -- even though it was nominated for an Academy Award (Oscar). But, regardless, I gave it a try; and I'm happy I did. "The Descendants" is one of my absolute favorites of the year! The story is fresh and the acting is superb; Alexander Payne's directing is stellar! It's been a while since I've seen a film that hits all the right marks. Even though there is one small aspect to the film that was predictable, it doesn't subdue the effect of the film's message, nor does it take away from the overall excellence of the film itself. Thank goodness George Clooney chose this film after last year's disastrous <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG993Q">The American</a>! And Shailene Woodley (the horrid ABC Family show <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005C46L3O">The Secret Life of the American Teenager: Volumes 1-6</a>) dazzles in her first major movie role; I can't wait to see what she does next ... even though it will probably be some dopey teenage comedy. I especially liked the fact that Clooney portrays a father who was not always emotionally present in his family's life and now he is the one to take care of his two unruly daughters, both of whom he has no idea how to raise (welcome to the club of every father with two daughters). This film takes a desperately tragic situation and injects a small dose of comedy in with a touching story of family bonding to make one of the movies you should definitely see!</p></body></html>

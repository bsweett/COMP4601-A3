This is how the story goes: The story of Jamal Malik, an 18 year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai, who is about to experience the biggest day of his life. With the whole nation watching, he is just one question away from winning a staggering 20 million rupees on India's "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?" But when the show breaks for the night, police arrest him on suspicion of cheating; how could a street kid know so much? Desperate to prove his innocence, Jamal tells the story of his life in the slum where he and his brother grew up, of their adventures together on the road, of vicious encounters with local gangs, and of Latika, the girl he loved and lost. Each chapter of his story reveals the key to the answer to one of the game show's questions. Intrigued by Jamal's story, the jaded Police Inspector begins to wonder what a young man with no apparent desire for riches is really doing on this game show? When the new day dawns and Jamal returns to answer the final question, the Inspector and sixty million viewers are about to find out...<br /><br />The cast led by Dev Patel (as Jamal) & Freida Pinto (as Latika) is excellent! The directing by Danny Boyle (Oscar-nominated) (who also directed "Sunshine" (2007), "Millions" (2004), "28 Days Later..." (2002), "The Beach" (2000), "A Life Less Ordinary" (1997), "Trainspotting" (1996), & "Shallow Grave" (1995) & Loveleen Tandan (co-director: India, also did the casting) is brilliant! The screenplay (Oscar-nominated) (based on Vikas Swarup's novel "Q & A") by Simon Beaufoy (who also wrote the Oscar-nominated screenplay to "The Full Monty" (1997) is brilliant!<br /><br />The (Oscar-nominated) music by A.R. Rahman is brilliant! The (Oscar-nominated) cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle (who also did the cinematography to Boyle's "28 Days Later..." & "Millions") is excellent! The (Oscar-nominated) film editing by Chris Dickens (who also did the film editing to "Shaun Of The Dead" (2004) & "Hot Fuzz" (2007) is brilliant! The casting by Gail Stevens (who also been doing the casting to Boyle's films since "Trainspotting", except "A Life Less Ordinary") & Loveleen Tandan is excellent! The production design by Mark Digby (who was an supervising art director on "28 Days Later..." & "Millions" is excellent! The set decoration by Michelle Day (who was an art department assistant on "28 Days Later..." & did the set decoration to "Millions", "Sunshine" & "28 Weeks Later" (2007, which Boyle executive produced) is excellent! The costume design by Suttirat Anne Larlarb (who also did the costume design to "Sunshine") is excellent!<br /><br />This is an brilliant drama that is unlike anything you have seen this year or last year, actually. This is Danny Boyle's best film of his career, thus far. This is one of the best films of last year.</p></body></html>

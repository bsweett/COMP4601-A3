<meta name="summary" content="Some potential wasted on lovely sadism in the Australian sun"></head><body><p>Wolf Creek definitely makes a go at being a fresh, new take on a sorta-slasher movie.  For one, it's Australian, so not quite as chained to the Hollywood conventions and necessities.  On the other hand, it's a bit uneven and is then only remembered as another lovely outing in the serial killer / torture / sadism / shock genre.<br /><br />A group of backpackers (two girls and a guy) take a trip to the Australian outback.  Eventually, they come in contact with a Crocodile Dundee-type outbacker guy who turns out to be a complete psycho who likes to kidnap, torture, and murder people, sometimes paralyzing and mutilating them for the audience, too.<br /><br />We then get the now-classic escape by the lone girl (or is it the guy?) sequence in which someone witnesses bad, awful things happening (like torture), escapes, fights and wounds the bad guy, escapes, fights more, etc, etc, etc.  Adjust the level of nihilism and you get a slightly different ending each time, but still the same dark message: you will die, no matter what.  This time, the message is infused with some truly stunning outdoor photography, a bit more character development that I can't recall, and a lack of deep character development (of madman Mick) that I DO recall since it was effectively played and spooky.  A few creepy moments to be sure, but few of them involve blood and gore, which is sporadic but not wall-to-wall.  No, Wolf Creek is a drawn out exercise in terror that gets pretty demented and depraved, but is only memorable by its (straight down) story arc.  No ridiculous plot twist ala the also-foreign High Tension, but nothing really new.<br /><br />The DVD has a few extras but nothing very enlightening about the film, though overall the release looks amazing in parts with its shots of the outback.  Almost two movies in some ways, the plot about the backpackers themselves, the atmosphere, and the photography are largely wasted once the mayhem begins.  It doesn't make the stalking more terrifying to know this much mundane detail about these people (like they drink, and smoke, and have relations, etc, etc).  Effects fans may enjoy some of the work simulating a real insane killer's skills.  Reviled by some critics, hailed by others, that's the type of film it is...either it's a repugnant, sick movie, or an effective, terrifying warning.<br /><br />No doubt a Wolf Creek 2 awaits one day, because life in these times wouldn't be complete without another film detailing the exact methods of torture used on random people by a serial killer in the Australian outback, perhaps they can top the 'head on a stick' bit here.  Used in Vietnam by the USA, reminds the Aussies!</p></body></html>

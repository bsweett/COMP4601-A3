<meta name="summary" content="Not Better than the first, but it has it's moments"></head><body><p>In this sequel , Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is up against an ingenious Russian (Mickey Rourke) that wants revenge on the Stark family for having his father deported from America. While a rich weapons manufacturer (Sam Rockwell) wants to use Rourke to build him Iron Man suits since Stark won't give his up to the government. While Stark has to find a new energy source that can keep him alive and isn't too confident that he can. But Stark's military friend (Don Cheadle) is more than ready to step in his shoes with the War Machine outfit.<br /><br />  The movie is as slow as the first to pick up and give us some action. The first is a little better though since it doesn't take as long to give us some action. Plus some viewers might find the end fight to be too short and not even as good as the end fight of the first film. Still, I wouldn't call Iron Man 2 a disappointment, the movie is far better than a lot of the summer movies that came out last summer, like Transformers 2. Transformers 2 had a lot more action, but it was too loud and un-involving.<br /><br />  When I watching the first Iron Man yesterday, I realized that Stark should have at least looked more in pain and weak after the operation that removed half his chest. I mean his body took too it too well I thought. So what I really liked about Iron Man 2 is that his body is starting to have a negative reaction to what saved his life in the first film. It was also nice to see more comic book characters in this sequel like Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Whiplash (Mickey Rourke).</p></body></html>

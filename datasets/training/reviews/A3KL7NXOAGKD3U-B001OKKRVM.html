That is what I would call this masterpiece...first of all, I am not the documentary type...but this one I had to watch because of all the hype that it was getting!!  And thank GOD that this movie lived up to its hype. Beautifully done, with poise and confidence of all involved in this picture.  Very informative in the life of a penguin.  These little guys and gals go through pure hell during the winter months!! I must warn parents that although this is a G rated movie, there are some death scenes of baby penguins and adult penguins alike.  If your child is sensitive to this kind of material, the best thing that you can do is talk to them about it.  Very National Geographic esq. But fun, interesting, informative, and just a really cool movie...ENJOY!!</p></body></html>

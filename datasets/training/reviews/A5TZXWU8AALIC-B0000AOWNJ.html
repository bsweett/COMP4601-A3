<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Horror Films in a Long Time"></head><body><p>What makes this an extremely effective horror film is this: it's rated PG-13.<br /><br />As modern horror films indulge in grotesque but tiresome bloodbaths, THE RING manages to fill the screen with a gloomy dread and a few good shocks.  The cast is excellent (I think Naomi Watts is one of the best actresses in movies these days) and the direction is tight and driven.<br /><br />I rented the original Japanese film, RINGU, on which this version is based, and enjoyed it as well.  It'll probably depend on which you see first as far as which you'll like better, but it's worth doing if you liked the story.<br /><br />It creeped me out for days afterward without a drop of gore.</p></body></html>

Yet, this story about the mysterious candy maker does indulge in some liberties of its own.<br /><br />In addition to updated special effects, it attempted to explain why Willy Wonka ended up the way he did.<br /><br />Willy Wonka (Depp) was himself an unfortunate child at one point. He grew up with a sinister dentist father and never quite forgot the experience. Even when he became famous and rich, Wonka remembered where he came from. This gives him something to empathize with. The film honestly could have flown without this subplot being tucked in, but because it (again owning to Burton's direction more than anything) did not distract from the overall storyline, the inclusion is tolerable.<br /><br />The Wonka in this film is a gothic metrosexual type. Frankly when I looked at him, I first thought of Marilyn Manson or another shock rocker. While I usually only see remakes of classic films (regardless of how accurate the originals themselves really were) only because there is nothing else to do, the idea of seeing 'Marilyn Manson' give spoiled brats (who, yes, are especially mean in this film) their just deserts was something which I could not miss. Sure enough, it provided me with a tasty summer treat.<br /><br />Ed Wood did a marvelous job with this film, understanding Dahl's original work. Because Dahl's work was never meant to be 'family friendly' these two are the perfect combination for each other<br /><br />It's so easy these days for studios to attempt substituting flashy graphics and other special effects for any semblance of plot, but the special effect innovations in this film were used sparingly.  Even the computer-replicated oompa loompas looked remarkably real and were not just thrown in for the sake of it. Plus, they've got some new songs.</p></body></html>

Six students and a teacher manage to escape a plane crash thanks to a premonition of Alex Browning, one of them. A few weeks later, Death starts to kill the survivors one by one. FINAL DESTINATION is basically a stupid movie about a good idea. There isn't here only one smart scene or idea, it seems that the director wanted to please the teen audience by delivering another pimply shocker and that's all. In these perspective, a film like Peter Jackson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ASATYO">The Frighteners (Director's Cut)</a> which handles some of the themes of FINAL DESTINATION is a masterpiece! This one is unfortunately already forgotten.</p></body></html>

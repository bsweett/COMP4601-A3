<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing plot and effects"></head><body><p>This second installment in the Harry Potter series has some fun moments. I love the character of Gilderoy Lockhart. He's well played and adds humor to the movie. Hagrid's character also gets some more development.<br /><br />I'm not as crazy about the plot. It's a bit too convoluted, and much of it is never really explained well (even after watching "Half-Blood Prince," I still don't understand how Voldemort could have controlled Ginny Weasley or lived through a book). Dobby was really annoying. He's way too dramatic and a sadomasochist to boot. Would anybody really believe that programming a ball to attack and almost kill Harry Potter was really going to succeed in keeping him away from Hogwarts? It just doesn't add up.<br /><br />Also, the basilisk and spiders were somewhat disappointing and pretty dull. The spiders aren't as exciting as Shelob in Lord of the Rings. The basilisk was somewhat believable, but sometimes looked like a big movie prop. Maybe a special edition could be released with better monster designs.<br /><br />Overall, this is probably tied with "Half-Blood Prince" as my least favorite in the series. It's definitely worth watching if you like the Harry Potter movies, but should have been much better.</p></body></html>

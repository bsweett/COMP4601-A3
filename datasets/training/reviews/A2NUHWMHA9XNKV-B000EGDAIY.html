<meta name="summary" content="i'm gonna be the odd one out , BECAUSE  i really like it"></head><body><p>this movie to me is spooky.  I think this is good thriller/suspence horror movie, so if your expecting to see zombies, monsters or whatever its not for you. Its like SAW, The Sixth Sense, Skeleton Key and the Village all these things are happening in front of you and just when you think you got it figured out it all makes sense to you. I mean in The Grudge just the sounds that the dead family made spook me, for me it was like a eerie feeling i got when i heard it and if a movie can do that to me its doing what its supose to do scare the bejezzy out of me<br /><br />I just wanna say you have 2 types of people on amazon, the type who really likes something and the type who hates on everyone for liking it...<br /><br />Also Recommended: the sixth sense, frailty, the village, Saw1&2, skeleton key</p></body></html>

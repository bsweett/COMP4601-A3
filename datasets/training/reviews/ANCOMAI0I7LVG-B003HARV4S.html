In fact, this is one of the better achievements in the year that was 2006, a year that was so rich with film and yet seems so underappreciated (yes, Martin Scorsese finally won his Oscar, but `The Departed' represents some of the more middlebrow, overrated fare the year had to offer).<br /><br />`The Illusionist' is beyond intoxicating.<br /><br />The film tells the story of undying love.  Set in Vienna, the story centers on renowned illusionist Eisenheim.  Growing up poor and essentially banned from seeing the love of his youth, Duchess Sophie, Eisenheim is reunited with his love 15 years later.  By this time she is betrothed to another, a violent tempered Crown Prince with ideas of ruining a nation.  Devising a plan to be together, all seems dangerous yet doable until Sophie turns up dead.<br /><br />Enter Chief Inspector Uhl.<br /><br />Thank goodness for casting directors with their thinking caps on.  Edward Norton is superb as Eisenheim, a man completely withdrawn into his own world yet confidently assertive into the lives of those around him.  He is commanding and unforgettable.  Rufus Sewell (he needs more films like this) is impressively oppressive and spine chillingly creepy and Jessica Biel defines damsel in distress with her soft lips and limber body language that beg to be embraced.  But, for me, this film is all about Paul Giamatti.  For a man who can fall, very easily, into caricature, his performance as Uhl is so astute and technically dominating that I found myself caught up in his every scene.<br /><br />I just loved watching him and Norton interact; like to masters prodding one another along with a slight arrogance that should complete control of the situation at hand.<br /><br />The film is elegantly shot, much like a piece of art, the scenes just melt off the screen and imprint themselves into the minds of the viewer.  It suffered due to being released in the same year as Christopher Nolan's equally outstanding `The Prestige', but one should not forget `The Illusionist'.  They are two very different films, despite a recurring theme (the art of the illusion is not one-note, that is for sure).  One of the best films to be nearly completely forgotten, `The Illusionist' is one you really need to see to believe; believe me!</p></body></html>

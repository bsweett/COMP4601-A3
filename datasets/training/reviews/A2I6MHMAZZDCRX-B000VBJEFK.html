<meta name="summary" content="A Slight Stumble for Pixar"></head><body><p>Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) has a refined sense of smell and a love of good food.  His hero is the late, great chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett), and thanks to his TV show and cookbook, Remy has the knowledge to be one of the best chefs in the world.  The only problem?  Remy's a rat.<br /><br />When Remy's family is forced to evacuate their home, Remy gets separated from them.  He winds up in Paris just outside of Gusteau's restaurant.  Since he can't resist seeing where his idol once worked, Remy sneaks inside.<br /><br />And that's how Remy meets Linguini (Lou Romano).  Linguini is the new garbage boy at the restaurant, and he's something of a klutz.  When Linguini accidentally ruins a soup, Remy can't help but fix it.  The new recipe is a huge success, but only Linguini knows that a rat made it.<br /><br />And so beings their partnership.  Remy provides the cooking knowledge and Linguini provides the human form.  Together, they begin to turn the reputation of the restaurant around.  But can they keep their secret hidden?<br /><br />I have been a Pixar fan since Toy Story was released, but this was the first one I didn't love.  Maybe it's director Brad Bird since I didn't like his The Iron Giant, and I had to watch The Incredibles a couple times before I truly enjoyed it.<br /><br />Maybe I'll enjoy this one more after I see it a few more times because there are lots of things to recommend it.  There are some truly funny parts, especially the scenes where Remy is trying to control Linguini.  And their first scene working together is a riot as well.  The animation is wonderful with a few breath taking shots of Paris.  And I liked the fact that Remy could only talk to other rats.  The fact that the humans and animals couldn't talk is a nice twist on the standard animated film.  And the animators do a great job of using body language to convey their characters every thought and feeling.  And the voice cast of well knowns and unknowns does an excellent job.<br /><br />So where exactly did the movie fall apart?  It was just too busy.  Remy has a storyline with a couple plots.  Linguini has his own issues.  And neither one is really given time to develop fully.  We focus on one issue for a while, then move on to something else.  Item three gets resolved, then we get item four before going back to two, then five, then....  You get the idea.  If they had taken out one of the sub-plots, anyone of them, it would have allowed more time to better develop the plots that remained and even develop the characters better.<br /><br />Then there's the fact that the movie really isn't aimed at kids.  I'm not arguing with the G rating.  There just isn't that much action to hold their interest.  Elementary age and above should be able to track the story, so they will enjoy it more.<br /><br />This is an entertaining movie that is worth seeing.  Just don't go expecting the great story telling that Pixar usually provides.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="STUNNING, PROVACATIVE AND WROUGHT IN CONSPIRACIES OF TENSION"></head><body><p>&quot;J.F.K.&quot; is Oliver Stone's opus magnum: a thrilling, taut investigation of the assassination of President Kennedy. Did Oswald really pull the trigger that fateful afternoon in Dallas? Perhaps we'll never know. But the film is a potpouri of investigative threads and niche conspiracy theories that, at least for my money, hold more than an ounce of truth. At the very least it shoots holes in the Warren Commission Report which - for anyone who's read it - isn't hard to do.<br />TRANSFER: This is the same stunning transfer that Warner Brothers gave us several years before as part of the Oliver Stone Collection. It's the director's cut. Colors are rich, fully saturated and well balanced. Black and contrast levels are solid. There is a subtle hint of edge enhancement and minor shimmering of fine details but neither will distract. The audio is 5.1 and powerful on every level.<br />EXTRAS: Ah, here's the reason for the re-issue: the brilliant documentary, &quot;Behind The Conspiracy&quot; which is thought-provoking and chilling; sort of like Einstein meets The Silence of the Lambs. There's also all the DVD-ROM junket stuff that came with the previously issued disc.<br />BOTTOM LINE: I had a hard time justifying buying this one again because the only extra feature not previously available was the documentary. But I believe this is a worth-while re-purchase for anyone who owns the previously issued DVD.</p></body></html>

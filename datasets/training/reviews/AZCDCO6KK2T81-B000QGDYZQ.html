<meta name="summary" content="3.5 Stars: Better than expected, but . . ."></head><body><p>While this is a tour-de-force for Sandra Bullock, she alone can't hold the entire complex and convoluted film together without some serious help.  She gets fine support by all in this film including a subtle Julian ("I have weird eyebrows") McMahon (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNTU">Fantastic Four</a>) as her doomed husband, the ever gorgeous Nia Long (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000803BQC">Are We There Yet?</a>) as her best friend, and the always reliable and familar Kate Nelligan as her mom.  Even the children are better than most other child actors we see in films today.<br /><br />Sadly, all this good acting doesn't excuse the overly complicated script that both loses the audience at times with it's complexity and reveals itself to be quite predictable too.  That sounds like the perfect oxymoron at work.  The plot is different, even unique in some ways and for awhile the mystery is interesting if not even compelling, but once you get the idea of what is happening, everything falls into place too easily and the ending is anything but a surprise.<br /><br />I gave this film 3.5 stars for it's unique, but admittedly flawed, storyline which is, overall, entertaining, the terrifically compelling performance by Bullock, and the fine support of her co-stars.  I even have to give credit to the director for just an honest attempt at creating something different in this mind-bending, time-traveling little thriller.  I also think it is noteworthy that at the heart of this story is a woman who no longer knows what is important in her life that is worth fighting for and a marriage that is perhaps all too typical in our society today where we take others for granted and whine about the mundane aspects that fill all our lives.</p></body></html>

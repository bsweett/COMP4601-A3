<meta name="summary" content="THE BIG LEBOWSKI (&quot;I'm the 'Dude'&quot;)"></head><body><p>The Coen Brothers use bowling as their metaphor in this inimitable tale of mistaken identity, art, and a rug that really tied a room together.  Jeff Bridges (in an Oscar worthy performance) is Jeff Lebowski, a character who  goes by the name &quot;The Dude,&quot; has a penchant for white russians,  and seems to be perpetually mired in the '60s.  When the wife of another  Jeff Lebowski (the &quot;Big&quot; Lebowski, played by David Huddleston),  is purportedly kidnapped, the Dude and his friend Walter (John Goodman as a  singular-minded Vietnam vet with his own unique perspective on life and the  rules by which it must be played) bowl their way through the ensuing  turmoil, which includes a band of nihilists (lead by Peter Stormare), a  stranger (Sam Elliott) who assists in the telling of the tale, a man named  Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara) who is a self-styled purveyor of adult  entertainment, a rival bowler named Jesus (an hilarious turn by John  Turturro), a moronic pair of rug soilers, a local beach community constable  long on attitude, a shady private eye, dreams subject to myriad  interpretations, an errant toe, and a marmot.  Rounding out the stellar  supporting cast are Steve Buscemi as Donnie, the third member of the Dude  and Walter's bowling team, Julianne Moore as the Big Lebowski's daughter,  and the ever versatile Philip Seymour Hoffman as his assistant.  &quot;The  Big Lebowski&quot; is stylishly crafted, wickedly funny, and will leave you  craving more of the same.</p></body></html>

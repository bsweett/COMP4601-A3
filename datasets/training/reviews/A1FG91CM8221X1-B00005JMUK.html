<meta name="summary" content="Are monsters made or born?"></head><body><p>There is an old literary and cinematic adage that great monsters evoke both pity and terror. By that standard, Charlize Theron makes a magnificent monster as serial killer Aileen Wuornos; by any standard Theron's performance in Patty Jenkins' "Monster" must stand as one of the most courageous and emotionally naked in recent memory. The beautiful Theron deglamorized herself severely to play Wuornos, a "highway hooker" who in the movie is driven to madness and murder by a combination of family rejection, grinding poverty, abusive johns and her hopeless love for a young girl (played persuasively by Christina Ricci). But is this the way it really happened? Sue Russell, a freelance journalist and author of a book about Wuornos, faults the movie among other things for not showing that Wuornos' murderous temper, in fact, first showed itself in childhood, long before the events of the movie. Russell also points out that while Wuornos probably was raped several times, it is highly doubtful that any of the johns she murdered were among her rapists. While these are important points, there is no denying that Wuornos' situation was dire, and not entirely of her own making. Wuornos is already a desperate character when we first see her, taking shelter from the rain under a highway overpass and contemplating suicide. Theron brilliantly evokes Wuornos' mental disintegration; toward the end, still talking up her dreams, her eyes are as blank and expressionless as a shark's. "Monster" isn't exactly pleasant viewing, but thanks to Jenkins' craftsmanship and Theron's performance, it keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. No movie since "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" has painted such a riveting portrait of a killer's pathology as "Monster."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A DVD review"></head><body><p>A fun brainless movie that is weak as a coherent whole, but each separate scene is fun to watch.  The rather stop-go flow of the movie makes since if one realizes the director is only known for directing music videos.  You can almost see where the non-existent commercials should go. Overall the movie is a mix between Mission Impossible, The Matrix, and Austin Powers. Even the director acknowledges this in the commentary. The commentary was okay, but didn't give any more information about the making of the movie than did the featurettes.  The featurettes could have been combined to make one documentary. The most interesting is the martial arts featurette, which features the same Chinese trainer that they used in The Matrix. The most boring featurette is the one about the director, which mostly consists of him being very enthusiastic. There are three deleted scenes included in this DVD. One were Curry and Murray are playing Marco Polo in a swimming pool, another where Diaz, Barrymore (dressed as men) and Curry are in the men's bathroom, and finally one love scene with Barrymore and the kidnap victim. Each doesn't do anything for the film, aren't interesting or funny and are rightfully cut. Two music videos are included. One original hip-hop song and video. The other a typical music video of a remake of the Charlie's Angel theme showing the band intercut with scenes from the movie. Overall the music videos are not that interesting. The most disappointing feature was the outtakes. These are the exact same outtakes seen in the end-credits without the credits. Why these count as an extra is beyond me. Finally standard filmographies are included which are short even by current standards. Overall the bonus features for this DVD are a bit disappointing. I wouldn't get this DVD for the bonus features, but for the simple, fun to watch visual candy. An average value.</p></body></html>

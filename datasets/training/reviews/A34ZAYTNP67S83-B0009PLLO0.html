<meta name="summary" content="The Ultimate Edition"></head><body><p>Before I begin, I should first state that most of the imperfections that existed before this edition was released are still present.  But that when all's said and done, this is the only cut that should have survived a triple-dip of DVD releases.  The fact that in his introduction, Oliver Stone asks us to 'enjoy every sublime and awkward pixel', leads us to reason that this still isn't the final product he had in mind, but this is as good as it's ever going to get.<br /><br />I always said that Alexander deserved to be given the "Rome" treatment, and that even at under 4 hours, it should have been longer.  Like Alexander, Oliver Stone's reach exceded his grasp, but not many other filmmakers would have had the chutzpah to try.<br /><br />The biggest problem this movie faced was its erratic casting.  Physically, Colin Farrell a shining gem of a leading man, but he's yet to prove he's much more than a pretty boy, possessing neither the charisma nor the acting chops to pull this role off (but it doesn't help that he's saddled down with some ham-handed lines).<br /><br />I give him credit however, for not many major actors in the world would have kissed another man onscreen for fear of being either being typecast or made to look like a fool.<br /><br />Much has been made of Angelina Jolie's "ridiculous" accent, and I agree that it's jarring, not to mention ridiculous--Stone had Farrell speak in his own Irish brogue, so why ask Jolie to sound like a modern day Irene Papas?  Neither she nor co-star Val Kilmer as King Phillip need any acting lessons, but both seem like they'd phoned in their parts.<br /><br />No such excuses for Jared Leto, who's only role seems to be to look worried and glance longingly at Alexander from time to time when we need reminding about sexual ambiguity.<br /><br />Another complaint is the inclusion of Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy the Elder as a narrator, claiming that the use of a narrator is proof of bad writing (the idea that you need a narrator implies that the story needs to be explained to you), and generally that's a valid complaint, but in this movie, I think the use of narration adds to the gravitas--otherwise it's just another Colin Farrell flick.</p></body></html>

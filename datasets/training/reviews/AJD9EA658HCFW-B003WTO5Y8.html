Both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins did an exellent job acting in this movie.<br /><br />The movie starts out showing Jodie Foster in training for the F.B.I, while training she gets called into the administraters office. She is assined to try to get information from Dr. (Hannable) Lector, on buffalo bill, who has kiddnapped a bunch of women.<br /><br />Silence of the Lambs is very good and gets you hooked and keeps your interest throught the whole film!!!</p></body></html>

His therapy was going nowhere.&quot;"></head><body><p>Well, I finally went out and got the special edition of "The Silence of the Lambs."  I wasn't really planning to, because I had already bought the movie two times before.  The first time was when it first came out on DVD, which was a pretty lousy copy.  Low quality video and sound, almost no extra features, and so on.  Then, I bought the Criterion Collection version, and it was indeed an improvement.  It didn't have a lot of special features, but it had a few.  And the picture and sound was much better.<p>So why did I finally break down and buy this version?  Well, after re-visiting "Hannibal" after seeing "Red Dragon," I realized how much I really loved this film.  And, I also learned that it was remastered in a high-definition 16x9 anamorphic transfer and 5.1 Surround Sound.  So, I finally broke down and purchased this copy.  Plus, I knew that I could still keep my Criterion version, because it had features such as commentary that is unavailable on this version.  Overall verdict: I ended up very happy that I bought this version, because it is far superior to the other two.<p>Before I get into the DVD aspect of the film, allow me to recap the story for those who are unfamiliar with the story.  I'm sure that number is very small, but I might as well just in case.  Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, an FBI agent in training.  One of her first assignments is to talk to a vicious serial killer, known as Hannibal "the Cannibal" Lecter, hoping to get into the mind of a killer to catch another who is on the loose.  But it isn't going to be easy, for Hannibal has an agenda of his own, and he loves to get into the minds of others.  This all adds up to a terrifying and nightmarish thriller that you will never forget.<p>The acting is outstanding.  Jodie Foster does her part justice in every way.  And Anthony Hopkins is amazing as Hannibal.  Who would've thought that he could play such a terrifying role?  You could tell that he was having fun with it.  The director did a great job of painting us a picture full of darkness, nightmares, and dread.  Ted Tally did a terrific job of writing a script that was very true to the novel (he also returned to write the screenplay for "Red Dragon").<p>And now, for the DVD.  This version of the film is quite an improvement on all different fronts.  The picture is crystal clear and you can swear that you're seeing things you never saw before.  The lightness and darkness is perfect.  The sound is also a big improvement; loud when it's supposed to be and quiet when it's supposed to be.  There are many special features, which include a brand new documentary that includes new interviews with the cast and crew, 20 minutes of deleted scenes, the original 1991 "Making of" featurette, an outtake reel, trailers, and many more where that came from.  I really enjoyed watching the documentary and interviews; especially the new ones made specifically for the DVD.  They are really interesting.  But I really enjoyed all of the special features.  (Just remember if you have the Criterion version, keep it, since this newer version does not include commentary from the cast and crew.)<p>So, I was very happy to finally break down and buy this new and improved version of an ultimate and frightening classic, "The Silence of the Lambs."  It still remains as one of my favorites (would have to be if I bought the movie three times!).  If this is one of your favorites as well, then I recommend getting it.  It is really a big improvement in many different ways.<p>Oh yeah, if you've never seen the movie, don't go in expecting a horror movie.  A lot of people have been saying it's a good movie but it's a bad horror film.  I really do not consider this a horror movie.  I think of it more as a dark thriller.  When I think of "horror," I think of all of the Freddy and Jason movies.  Then again, that's just me.</p></body></html>

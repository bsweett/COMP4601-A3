<meta name="summary" content="Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear as one of your odder odd couples"></head><body><p>We have all scene countless movies about two people who should not be on the same planet let alone in the same room together who bond through some cinematic ordeal and become an unlikely pair of friends.  "The Matador" is one of those types of movies.  Julian Noble (Pierce Brosnan) is a professional hit man, whose euphemism of choice is that he is a "facilitator" of fatalities.  Then we have Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear), a businessman who is in Mexico City desperately trying to salvage a business deal that has probably already gone south.  Julian is already there to do some of his facilitating when they meet in the hotel bar.  Over drinks Danny tells about the death of his infant son, and Julian responds by telling a dirty joke.<br /><br />It would be hard for a relationship to get off of more of a bad foot (I believe the record is held by Richard, the Duke of Gloucester, who woos the Lady Anne while she is praying over the coffin of her husband, who was killed by Richard, as detailed in the romantic comedy "Richard III").  But while Julian has no social skills beyond juvenile comebacks, dirty jokes, and outright lies, he has found in Danny somebody who is willing to actually listen to what he has to say.  That compels Julian to actually say something of substance and this new experience comes to a head at the local bullring where Danny asks what Julian does for a living and he decides to not only tell his new friend the truth, but also shows him how to play the game.<br /><br />Things come to a head between Danny and Julian several times, and with Julian banging on Danny's hotel door trying to (again) apologize, we jump six months down the road.  This time when Julian starts knocking on Danny's door it is back at his home in Denver where he lives with his wife Carolyn (Hope Davis), who is called "Bean."  Julian has been suffering from panic attacks and has lost the war.  This is not the sort of thing his employer, Mr. Randy (Philip Baker Hall), is willing to tolerate and Julian tells Danny that he has one last chance to do a job and do it right, or else it is more than his professional career that is going to be terminated.  Danny, somewhat to our surprise, not only agrees, but is insistent on helping Julian.<br /><br />What the hell happened in that six month gap created when Richard Shepard's film jumped forward?  That is a good question, and the good news is that this film has a great answer to that good question.  One of the things that I want from a film like this is a rationale explanation for why two people who are opposites should decide that they compliment each other rather than rub each other the wrong way and end up being friends.  "The Matador" has that and it is what makes the film work, along with a memorable performance by Brosnan.  I would not exactly say he is exorcising James Bond in this movie, but there are definitely several in jokes that play off of that in the film.  Kinnear gets to play it straight while Brosnan lets out all the stops with his character.  Julian might be falling apart, but it is when he picks his moments to strip away the veneer, that make watching this film and its familiar "odd couple" plot line worth while.</p></body></html>

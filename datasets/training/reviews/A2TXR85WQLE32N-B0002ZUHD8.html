<meta name="summary" content="King Arthur--A Different Look..."></head><body><p>2004's "King Arthur" was a high concept, big name cast (Clive Owen, Keira Knightly, Ioan Giffud), but underappreciated reimagining of the classic English legend and perennial movie theme.  In this version, Arthur and his warriors are Eastern European contract horse soldiers serving in ancient Roman Britain.  As the story begins, the Romans are leaving on one tide,while the next brings invading Saxons.  Arthur and his men must also contend with the local Celtic tribe, led by Keira Knightly in an exotic female warrior outfit.<br /><br />Other reviewers have addressed the historical basis for this version of King Arthur.  For the general viewer, it may be enough that this is a good action movie, especially if you dump your preconceived notions about Camelot.<br /><br />As you might expect with any movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Antoine Fuqua, there are plenty of action sequences with strong, driving musical scoring.  Clive Owen is a brooding but noble Arthur; Ioan Giffud is a rather low-key but loyal Launcelot.  Arthur's fellow horse soldiers, his "knights of the round table", are miles and years from their Eastern European home; not many will make it back.  Skellan Skargard is a superly menancing Saxon warlord; his "at last, a man worth killing" is the takeaway line of the movie.<br /><br />Arthur and his horsemen, hard-pressed by the invading Saxons, will make a timely alliance with the Celts, setting up a climactic and suspenseful final battle scene.  Along the way, the movie makes a few bows toward the Arthurian traditions and gives Arthur time to make his own alliance with the lovely Knightley.  It's all in good fun, and highly recommended as an entertaining action movie.</p></body></html>

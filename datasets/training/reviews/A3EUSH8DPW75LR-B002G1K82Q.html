<meta name="summary" content="Amazing - A Must See"></head><body><p>This film is such a discovery and so unique.  Someone decided to take a chance and go into new territory and it more than succeeded.  A film that manages to show all the emotions and reality of what the late 60s was and to do it with very believable characters and Beatles music to boot.<br /><br />This film is more than a musical.  All emotions are expressed in song and having the characters sing them is amazingly effective.  I must say that you do not have to be a Beatles fan to admire this film.  The songs are used so expertly and so perfectly placed speaking such emotion that it's as if you are hearing them for the first time.  Also, the songs you know may take on a new meaning for they are so well interpreted here.  You also see the depth there really was to the Beatles songs, early in their career and later, for all carry an emotional wallop here.<br /><br />I found the male lead Jim Sturges as Jude the true revelation here.  His acting was superb.  His singing was amazing.  He not only had a great voice but he maneaged to evoke such sincere emotion and feelings into each song.  Evan Rachel Wood as Lucy was superb as well and seeing her here made me realize how many excellent films I have seen her in and what a great quality collection of work she is establishing. (Also, don't you love it - Jude and Lucy !! )<br /><br />The 60's defintitely live here and again the music runs the show.  Some are production numbers, some are solo pieces and some have action in the background.  ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE and HEY JUDE are both amazing.  This film will grab you and you will have an amzing experience.  Even Selma Hayek appeares in a very unique cameo and I was really wowed.  I had to give the film 4 stars for I found a few of the experimental song scenarios did not work well.  Very few, mind you.  So is this a masterpiece?  Not quite, but it is definitely one of the best films of the year and deserves a place in film history.  Excellent acting all around, great vocal interpretation with the great music selections.  And a plot that will grab you.  It shows the late 60's in a very unique way.<br /><br />I highly recomend this.  It is a must see.</p></body></html>

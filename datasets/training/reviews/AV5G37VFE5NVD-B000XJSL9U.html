<meta name="summary" content="Die Hardly"></head><body><p>"Live Free or Die Hard" sounds like a recipe for disaster.  It's directed by Len Wiseman, whose only previous credit worth mentioning is that he directed the "Underworld" movies.  It co-stars Justin Long, the obnoxious star of films like "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IZJZIU">Accepted</a>."  The plotline involves John McClane taking on computer hackers.  And the kicker?  It's rated PG-13.<br /><br />So imagine fans' surprise when the film begins receiving rave reviews, many calling it the best "Die Hard" since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O76T90">the original film</a>.  It enters the Internet Movie Database's Top 250 list.  It begins raking in the cash.  It's a hit.  Knowing all this, I went into "Live Free or Die Hard" with reasonable expectations and high hopes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I came out disappointed.  It's not that four "Die Hard" films is too many, nor that Bruce Willis has lost his touch.  A fourth "Die Hard" film could easily be stellar with a good writer and a talented director, and despite his age, Willis is just as cool as ever.  The first problem, and perhaps the most important one, is the rating.  For a PG-13 rating, the movie packs quite a punch, but the preceding films were known for their violence and profanity.  Willis' constant dropping of "F-bombs" was a big part of what made John McClane so appealing, because it emphasized that he was just an ordinary guy thrown into extraodinary situations.  As for the violence, it was part of what made the series so rough n' tough.  The worst part of it all is that it's clear executives pushed for a PG-13 to make more money, much like what they did with Paul W.S. Anderson's foolish "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AP04P6">AVP: Alien vs. Predator</a>."<br /><br />Now, without the ability to curse freely, John McClane seems a lot more quiet, a lot less ordinary, and more of a typical action hero.  He recalls Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name with his reserved cool and unflinching ability to kill.  Sure, McClane has his more down-to-earth moments, like talking to himself as he drives a car off a ramp and into a helicopter, and these are his best.  Fortunately, Willis has enough starpower to keep the character interesting, and make what we get of his trademark phrase, totaling "Yippi-ki-yay, mo--," hit home.<br /><br />The next problem: Len Wiseman.  Wiseman gives the film an honest effort, but he just doesn't quite fit.  He has style, but it's not the right style.  Wiseman's approach is slick and refined, unlike the gritty, tough, no-holds-barred style of previous directors John McTiernan and Renny Harlin.  Wiseman can't effectively handle tension, though he proves he's adept at effects-spectacular action sequences.  For the most part, though, they're just popcorn stuff.  There's no build-up, no surprise, no real structure to it: it's just smooth, effects-laden visuals.<br /><br />From Wiseman, all the other problems just sort of fold out.  The cast is young, fresh, and attractive, fitting Wiseman's general-audience approach.  Timothy Olyphant is a remarkably unmenacing villain when compared to Alan Rickman, Jeremy Irons, or William Sadler.  As predicted, Justin Long certainly has moments of obnoxiousness, but not unbearably so; still, a different actor could have done better in the role.  On the upside, Maggie Q adds some spark to her role, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead's zesty turn as McClane's daughter is fun.<br /><br />Mark Bomback's script is a big problem - it's dull, predictable, and by-the-books.  It lacks the originality of "Die Hard," the hopelessness of "Die Hard 2," the tension of "Die Hard: With a Vengeance."  The plot is thin and the scenes feel like they're just there to set up the action sequences.  To give some credit to Wiseman, he has enough skill to take the audience's mind off the lackluster plot line and keep them involved in the action.<br /><br />As a big fan of the previous entries, I really wanted to like "Live Free or Die Hard."  The cast and crew do put in honest efforts, but it just doesn't fit.  It feels like what it is, essentially: a PG-13 action sequel for the summer blockbuster season.  As your everyday action film, it delivers, but as a "Die Hard" film, it falls flat.  If there is one thing to praise the film for, it's the message that an old-fashioned hero like John McClane can still make a difference in our technology-ruled modern world.  But "Live Free or Die Hard," perhaps more fittingly titled "Die Hardly," will make a difference only to the most die-hard of "Die Hard" fans.</p></body></html>

Not just what's verified and what is speculation, but how accurate do you suppose the guesses are? It's very spooky, this movie. Holding a mirror up to what we have just lived through, and at a time when we did not yet know whether Obama would win and change things, or McCain would win and continue the basic plan.<br /><br />For one thing, most of the people who play well-known figures look quite like their roles, even Richard Dreyfuss as Darth Cheney. In fact, Josh Brolin as W. and James Cromwell as H.W. are the only two who are not particularly look-alikes, in that both actors are rather more lean and angular than the presidents were. Thandie Newton is positively spooky as Condi Rice. Toby Jones is a little smaller than Karl Rove, but just as slimy. Jeffrey Wright does not at first look all that much like Colin Powell, but he grows into the role -- or his makeup does.<br /><br />The early part of W's life is the only part we have not seen before, although we certainly heard about it. We see his fraternity initiation, but not his Skull and Bones one. We see him chatting up a Texas gal and persuading her that he's going to marry her, and then later hear that his father had to "take care of her" when she came up pregnant. He's in jail for reckless driving, and his father bails him out. But in his job in the oil fields, his try at Wall Street, and especially his lack of focus more generally, H.W. is deeply disappointed, and says so. In real life and in W.'s nightmares.<br /><br />We are also "treated" to his drying-out from alcohol, his born-again experience, his belief that God was calling him to run for president. Still, there seems to be more of the whiff of brimstone than the odor of sanctity about the man, especially ending every cabinet meeting with a silent prayer. If it was not phony, I almost wish it had been.<br /><br />The decision to invade Iraq, the Cheney power hunger, the way everyone in that cabinet room could go along with Cheney's plan to take over the entire middle east by surrounding and then conquering Iran; it's all so spooky that I simply cannot help asking myself: how much of this is the truth?<br /><br />It's a well-made movie about a very unsettling topic, and I would have preferred if the two men who portrayed the Bush presidents looked a little more like the real Bushes. Can't have everything. I would also have like more about some topics and less about others, but on the whole, the story hangs together as the biography of a man who never should have been elected to any office, let alone the presidency.</p></body></html>

In general, when you're dealing with a mystery/thriller, the best time for this to happen is as close to the final frame as possible. Think, for example, of the shock of revelation in the final two minutes of the best modern example, The Usual Suspects. The master of this sort of thing when it comes to stage productions is Martin McDonagh, whose The Pillowman may be the single finest play of the past thirty years. The interesting thing to note here is that when you're dealing with a mystery/thriller in formats other than the screen, the genre's best works often put that moment of revelation much earlier, as is the case in The Pillowman (or, in the world of the novel, Graham Greene's The End of the Affair). McDonagh, however, knows the difference between stage and screen. Which is kind of rare in and of itself.<br /><br />In Bruges is a story about two hit men, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson), who are instructed by their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes), to take a couple of weeks off and go see the sights in Bruges, a medieval Belgian town. Young, impetuous Ray can't stand the place from the moment he steps off the train; older, easier-going Ken is enchanted by the architecture (though not so much the tourists), but in the back of his head, he's wondering why the boss sent them here, of all places; talking it over in the pub, the two come to the conclusion there's a job to be done here, and the boss just hasn't told them what it is yet.<br /><br />That's about all I can tell you about the plot, for in true McDonagh style, mini-revelations start popping up pretty early on. You don't really need to focus on the plot, though, to have a lot of fun with this film, which despite being a pretty straight thriller is laced with all kinds of dark, absurd comedy. In fact, it sets itself up to be a character study of Ray, and so we expect in the back of our heads that, as with most character studies of this type, the plot is going to take a back seat to quirky characters anyway. (And this is one of those times when I catch another facet of the brilliance of a movie when I'm sitting here writing the review instead of while I was watching the flick.) That never really happens; the character-sketch aspects of this movie are very well-balanced with the plot aspects. We in the western film world are well-used to seeing basically plotless character sketches or plot-heavy films with cardboard cutouts in place of actual characters. Even when you do get a plot-heavy script that's got three-dimensional characters in it, it's still a plot-heavy script. McDonagh strikes a very fine balance here, and while his foot does slip occasionally, most of the time when you think this has devolved into a character sketch, you're wrong. McDonagh just hasn't thrown the right pieces at you yet for it to all make sense. (And despite what it may sound like, I'm certainly not saying these scenes can't simply be enjoyed for what they are; the drug-fueled party Farrell and Gleeson have with Jordan Prentice would be hysterical as its own separate short film, with no other context.)<br /><br />In Bruges ended up on a lot of ten-best-of-2008 lists, and rightly so. Definitely worth looking into, and the sooner the better. **** ?</p></body></html>

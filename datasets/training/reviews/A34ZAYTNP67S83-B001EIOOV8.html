<meta name="summary" content="Low-rent Scorcese, but still excellent"></head><body><p>Although the ending of "Casino" is not as satisfying as those earlier Scorcese films, the entire film is a wonderful exercise in film editing and directing.  <p>Of course, great attention has been paid to the soundtrack, which is occasionally jarring, but mostly fits in well with the action/dialogue.  This particular re-teaming of De Niro and Pesci is less effective than "Goodfellas", but that stems in part because we've already been there before, and that ride was a lot more fun.  De Niro seems to be walking through his part, and Pesci's aping the same part he played 6 years previously in "Goodfellas".<p>Much had been made of Sharon Stone's performance, which is the most effective of the three leads, but this is due in part to it being the most unpredictable.  <p>"Casino" runs a bit longer than it should, but it still rewards through repeat viewings.  James Woods in particular steals the movie every time he appears on screen.</p></body></html>

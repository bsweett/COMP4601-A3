A very good movie with Jack Nicholson playing the acerbic, rigid, but successful romance novalist, Melvin Udall.  He is a obsessive compulsive bachelor who lives alone and enjoys his daily routine.  Melvin enjoys breakfast every day at a local cafe and insists on a certain waitress, Carol Conelly (Helen Hunt).  His neighbor (Greg Kinnear) a gay painter, has an emergency and insists that Melvin take care of his cherished dog.  He knows Melvin is a stickler for detail and trusts Melvin.  Melvin also has to deal with Carol, who also must take off from work because her son is ill. This is too much change for Melvin, his world is turned upside down.  Profound changes await them all in this witty, touching tale.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear give a flawless perfomance and smart dialogue throughout.</p></body></html>

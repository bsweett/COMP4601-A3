<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful scenery, no story"></head><body><p>This movie was made for the scenery only. It didn't really have a story unless you want to make a movie about a woman getting screwed over and lied to by someone she loves. If that were the only reason that this movie was made, then look at real life. This movie had no real story. The battle scenes were disappointing, the love scenes were awful. To me, this was a total disappointment.</p></body></html>

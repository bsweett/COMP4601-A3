<meta name="summary" content="FROM POINT A TO POINT B ONE MORE TIME"></head><body><p>Professional transporter Frank Martin (Jason Statham) has surfaced once more for movie fans everywhere. A specialist in transporting goods from one spot to another without getting involved, Frank is the best there is. His current gig? Chauffer for a well to do family, the father of which is a member high in Washington's bureaucracy.<br /><br />Making sure that the official's son gets from one place to another, Frank ends up not only driving but getting involved with the young boy as well. So much for not getting involved. The two have a strong rapport and Frank teaches the boy things as well. On an ordinary trip to the pediatrician, the boy is kidnapped and Frank is thought of as the most likely suspect.<br /><br />Face it, fans of the TRANSPORTER films know right up front that there is no way that Frank Martin will let this kidnapping go on without a hitch or un-avenged. While the FBI and local police search for clues, Frank begins his one man battle not only to find the boy but to make sure that he is returned unharmed. The same can't be said for the bad guys that cross Frank's path.<br /><br />Both TRANSPORTER films relied heavily on action and taking a not so serious look at the genre that they attempt to command. And they both do just that, making us believe that Frank is capable of the feats he performs when fighting hand to hand or when using whatever objects are at his disposal to render those who cross his path inoperable.<br /><br />Jason Statham is not the usual gorgeous face that most leading men offer when a role like this comes along. Instead he seems more real, more deadly. And this sense of reality in appearance coupled with the unreality of the story lines and action seems to be a match made in heaven.<br /><br />Corrie Yuen returns as stunt choreographer for the fight sequences of this film and his work is probably the best that there is today in film. Nowhere else can you find the kicks, leaps and pummeling fists provided in such a ballet like form as in those that feature his work. Its enough that it makes you want to seek out more that he has been involved with.<br /><br />Director Louis Letterier, who helmed the first film along with Yuen as well as the recent UNLEASHED, will be a force to reckon with in the world of action films. Imaging his eye for detail and views of action sequences put to use in a Bond film would make the most die hard fan salivate.<br /><br />Sequels never seem to live up the expectations of fans of the first film. There is no way to replicate the first viewing of something different. It becomes old the second it is seen. The same can be said of this one, though it runs circles around most new films being released. And though a sequel, it does what so many films these days seem unable to do. It entertains.</p></body></html>

The cinematography is stunning providing many scenes that will live in your memory and continue to thrill you long after the movie is over.  The acting is superb, especially Alec Guiness as the commander torn between individual honor and inhibiting the efforts of the enemy.  It is, hands down, one of the most memorable war movies of all time and will be a favorite for sometime to come.</p></body></html>

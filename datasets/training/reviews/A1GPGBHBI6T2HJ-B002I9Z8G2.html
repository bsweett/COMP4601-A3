<meta name="summary" content="Better than 'Insurrection' but NOT the best Trek film..."></head><body><p>While I very much enjoyed 'First Contact' it left me asking a few questions...such as how did they come to all be on the new Enterprize E?  Or when/where/why did Geordi get Ocular Implants? Or my personal favorite: why did they alter established Trek History with the way they handled First Contact with Zephram Cochran?  Albeit only the true Trek nerds will understand that last one, but it seemed to me as though the story was unfolding before I came in at the beginning and I feel like I missed something important, and left me wanting more.  Now while wanting more is a good thing, it isn't necessarily so good when you feel that the storyline was incomplete, even if by just a little.<p>With that criticism out of the way, and I apologize it if is too big, but other than that, I very much enjoyed this 2nd outing on the big screen for the Next Generation.  It allowed a lot of humor which had been missing from the previous film, and gave us an exciting story mixed with a great deal of Trek History (even if it was altered a bit to suit Studio heads).  The effects were as usual top notch and while I am STILL waiting for a Trek movie to deal with the greatest nemesis the Next Gen folks ever faced (namely 'Q') I am fervently hoping that Paramount will give the folks a chance to redeem what a fiasco 'Insurrection' ended up being (not unlike how Trek VI more than made up for how horrible Trek V was...).  Folks, contact your Congressman, or whoever it takes to convince Paramount that a 4th Next Gen movie IS possible and SHOULD be made--provided they actually come up with a decent script.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Prawns"></head><body><p>Aliens arrive on earth and are turned in to slaves and left to dwell in a slum in Johannesburg. The aliens are known as Prawns You get to know them and their surroundings and their likes and dislikes. In short the documentary like opening takes you in to the world of the prawns. They have been exploited and the people want them out of the city so the government assigns this task to a resettlement company called MNU. This is where the main human characters are introduced, the most interesting one is Wikus played by Sharlto Copley. This guy is the son in law of one of the bosses at MNU and is responsible for the displacement of the Prawns. The movie follows his story and how he messes up himself and the entire effort at MNU. The movie is all over the place in terms of the story but things are rarely boring for one thing it was a very fast paced movie and I found myself glued to the screen even though I find most Sci-Fi movies cliched. The reason this movie worked was the seamless jump it takes from the documentary like opening to the actual story and the many story devices that kept the story going such as the slums, the eating habits of the prawns, the gangs etc. The action is pretty hardcore with a lot of flesh and body innards flying around. I gave this movie four stars 3/19/10</p></body></html>

One recent exception to my new, stricter rule is Dreamworks' "Kung Fu Panda."  My wife took our daughter to see this at the movies while I stayed at home with our youngest child.  I must admit that I envied my wife when she walked out of the house to see the film, for it had peaked my interest with its commercials and trailers.  When it arrived on DVD, my wife picked it up for the whole family.  She stated that she really enjoyed the film.  This was a good sign for me since my wife isn't into many animated films.<br /><br />From the wonderful opening "dream sequence" to the climactic battle with Tai Lung, "Kung Fu Panda" doesn't disappoint at all.  It's the story of Po (Jack Black), an overweight, clumsy panda who longs to become a great kung fu master like the legendary Furious Five.  Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) has guided the Furious Five for many years and has literally raised them to be great fighting machines.  Only one student fell to the wayside under Shifu, and that was the wicked (and imprisoned) Tai Lung (Ian McShane).  Tai Lung thinks he deserves to be the dragon warrior and therefore the only person wise and powerful enough to learn the secrets of the dragon scroll.<br /><br />When Po is named as the dragon warrior (much to the surprise of Shifu and the Furious Five), Tai Lung escapes his prison in order to claim what he feels is rightfully his.  Shifu and the Five must prepare Po for the greatest battle of his life.  Can they do it?  You'll have to watch this hilarious family flick to find out.<br /><br />Black is great as Po.  He fits into the clumsy, plus-sized role perfectly.  The Furious Five consists of the voice talents of Jackie Chan (Monkey), Lucy Liu (Viper), Seth Rogen (Mantis), David Cross (Crane) and Angelina Jolie (Tigress).  Each of the group is given a nice amount of screen time and they make wonderful straight men to the goofy Po.  McShane and Hoffman are also excellent in their roles.  Listen for more highly recognizable voices in smaller roles in the film as well.<br /><br />What makes "Kung Fu Panda" worthy of five stars is the fact that it manages to be a family friendly film with great comedy, brilliant animation and heart-stopping action sequences.  Honestly, some of the best fight sequences I've ever witnessed are in this film.  My particular favorite is a showdown between the Five and Tai Lung.  There's also the solid lesson of believing in oneself in order to achieve your dreams, no matter how far-fetched they might be.<br /><br />I highly recommend "Kung Fu Panda" to anyone who enjoys a great family film, comedy or action flick.  It covers all of those bases and is well worth multiple viewings.  Once again, I highly recommend this film and suggest you purchase a copy for yourself.</p></body></html>

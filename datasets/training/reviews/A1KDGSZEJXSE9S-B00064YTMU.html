I mean, Cruise<br /><br />and Foxx in a action flick? The problem is that Cruise is abit<br /><br />robotic in his behavior... Perhaps that's part of the point that<br /><br />he is a cold hearted killer..<br /><br />However, he simply wasn't ever fully able to make me believe that<br /><br />he is realistic. His behavior is not consistant... Sometimes he<br /><br />does well, but other times he makes sloppy mistakes that you<br /><br />really wouldn't expect a professional to do.<br /><br />Also, the movie works it's hardest to be completely realistic and<br /><br />that's a blessing in some ways, but in other ways it's a ledown.<br /><br />I do like realistic movies, but not to the point to where it does<br /><br />hurt the action... Until the end, there simply isn't enough action.<br /><br />It's a well acted movie other than Cruise... Jamie does well and<br /><br />the some of the wise cracks and a few scenes were good. It's<br /><br />very close to being a B movie.. And honestly, this movie was a<br /><br />big sign that Cruise is losing his star power because he simply<br /><br />can't hold this movie up.</p></body></html>

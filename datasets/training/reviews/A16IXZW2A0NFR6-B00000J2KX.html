This movie weaves it's web of terror slowly and digs its claws into you. Jack Nicholson is way over the top in this movie but I don't think it takes away from the film in fact it adds a little sense of camp to it. The hotel itself is the star of this movie though, and the cinemotography is top notch. Stanley Kubrick always tended to be somewhat mechanical and detached from the emotions onscreen as it is in the Shining, but the coldness adds to the bleak terror of it. The book is a lot different in the tone it sets and is also excellent. This movie version stands better on its own than as an adaptation of the novel. REDRUM.</p></body></html>

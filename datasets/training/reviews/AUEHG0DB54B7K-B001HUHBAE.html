<meta name="summary" content="A Thought Provoking Film"></head><body><p>First off, many of the reviewers have commented on the length of Zodiac.  It is 160 minutes long and I fall into the camp that felt the movie was on the long side.  It is an excellent film but I felt that the momentum was not very strong toward the end of the movie.  The story is told as events happened, date by date. This gives the narrative flow an episodic quality that sometimes seems disconnected.  There are also so many characters involved in the story that are easy to loose track of; for example, a movie projectionist suspected by Robert Graysmith was not well defined as a character and another character named Linda (who gave Graysmith some critical information) was difficult to connect to the story.  I kept wondering who Linda was and how she fit into the story until the dialogue revealed her significance.  It might have been a good idea to have included some a scene or two to introduce us to the first Zodiac victims since they play a pivotal part in Graysmith's later research.<br /><br />All of this said Zodiac is a remarkable film with excellent performances.  Jake Gyllenhaal is terrific as Robert Graysmith portraying him as a soft-spoken cartoonist who becomes obsessed with discovering who Zodiac is, and Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as columnist Paul Avery.  Mark Ruffalo is great as Inspector and becomes the hard working cop who gives Graysmith some off-the-record support. Chloe Sevigny is very good as Graysmith's wife and John Carroll Lynch (perhaps better know for his role in Fargo) makes a chilling suspect.  Brian Cox is great in the small role of attorney Marvin Belli.<br /><br />Zodiac seamlessly re-creates the late 60's and 1970's and is beautifully photographed by Harris Savides.  Zodiac is a film of the investigation of the Zodiac murders more than it is a murder mystery; we know nothing about the killer, as did the people who were trying to solve the murders.  We discover, as Robert Graysmith did, how the investigation was hampered by multiple jurisdictions with too many people performing the investigation but no one to lead them.  I am a fan of director David Fincher's Seven; he has created a thought provoking look at the Zodiac investigation.</p></body></html>

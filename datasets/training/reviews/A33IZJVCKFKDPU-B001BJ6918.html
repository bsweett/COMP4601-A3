<meta name="summary" content="Some of Tarantino's Best Writing"></head><body><p>I am a huge Quentin Tarantino fan.  I've seen all of his work and studied all of his writing and let me tell you, this is some of the best dialogue that I have heard in any movie since, well, Pulp Fiction.<p>The best scene (that there is no fighting in) would have to be Bill's speach about Superman.  Also, Budd and Elle have some great dialogue along with the Bride.  Oh yeah, her name is finally revealed, but I didn't understand why it was such a big secret.<p>This movie is a lot slower paced then Vol. 1.  If you haven't seen Vol. 1 then you will not know what is going on in this movie.  There aren't as many fight scenes in this movie.  But the one fight scene between Thurman and Hannah is definately worth remembering.  <p>This movie was really good.  I personally liked the first one better, mainly because there was a lot more action.  I wish that Samuel L. Jackson would have had a bigger role in Vol. 2, but no everything can go my way.  If you've seen Vol. 1, then definately see Vol. 2.  If not, then you may not want to see this movie.  One thing is for sure,  Quentin hasen't lost what makes him great, his ability to shock the audience.</p></body></html>

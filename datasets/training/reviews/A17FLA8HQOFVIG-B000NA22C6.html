<meta name="summary" content="Fine acting and directing heighten the tension.  Good story."></head><body><p>Take Johnny Depp, a movie star with fine acting abilities as well as box office draw.  Then take John Turturro, one of the best actors in Hollywood today.  Put them together in story adapted from a Stephen King novella.  Have the screenplay written and directed by David Koepp of Spider Man and Panic Room fame.  Have a big budget and shoot the exteriors in Canada and the interiors on a set in Los Angeles.  If you like scary movies, this is a winning combination. <p> <p>Johnny Depp is cast as a writer who is living in what he refers to as a cabin but is, in reality, what many people would consider an ideal rustic vacation home.  It has a secret window which looks out over a garden - hence the title.  He's an unhappy man because he's going through a messy divorce.  He sleeps most of the day and finds it difficult to write.  All of the sudden the doorbell rings.  Standing there is John Turturro, dressed in a black suit with a large brimmed black hat.  In a deep southern accent Turtorro accuses Depp of stealing his story. He even leaves his manuscript, which Depp soon realizes is the exact same story that he published several years before.  Turtorro starts to menace Depp.  It's all very frightening, especially since the atmosphere of the story is planned to have the utmost of tension.<p> <p>As the story unfolded I was completely drawn in, but a small part of me was impatient with the outcome.  Knowing this was originally written by Stephen King gave me a hint of the ending.  The plot thickens as the wife, played by Maria Bello and her boyfriend, played by Timothy Hutton, enter the story.  There's one scary moment after the other with no explanation.  There are several acts of violence, which intensify as the story progresses.  But by the ending, however, I wasn't surprised.  It's not a pleasant ending and left me with a rather hollow feeling.<p> <p>This certainly isn't a "feel good" movie and, even though the conclusion is satisfactory, it wasn't a conclusion I wanted.  But that's Stephen King for you!  Fans of his and of the stars will probably love it.</p></body></html>

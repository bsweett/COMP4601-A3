<meta name="summary" content="Not scary...Funny?"></head><body><p>Why did i laugh so much?, when im watching a so called horror film i dont want to laugh, i want to be shocked.  Comedy and horror dont mix, because i cant be scared if something is making me laugh.  The violence isnt anything special, and mostly is just a poor atempt to make it shocking but it doesnt work, especialy when they are sitting around on the roof playing a game to see if some guy can shoot the zombie that looks like a celebrity, yeah thats scary, theyre havin too much fun to try and pull off a scary situation, it seemed like fun to me.  They also never explain why everybody turned into a zombie, at least not in a way that makes sense.  Its also incredibly predictable and you know everything before it happens, its so obvious.  It made me laugh, not necesarily a bad thing but when im watching a "scary" movie i dont want humor, the performances werent anything above soap opera level, the story isnt exactly somethin you could make a good movie with in the first place, so i guess you shouldnt expect anything from this because you will be disapointed, i guess my hopes were to high for movie with zombies that didnt suck, every movie ive seen with zombies does (28 days later, resedent evil 1, house of the dead i cant believe they ruined that game, it was great, the movie was ridiculous, the list goes on...) and this is no exception.  1 out of a 10 for making me laugh, think of it as a comedy and you might not be so disapointed.</p></body></html>

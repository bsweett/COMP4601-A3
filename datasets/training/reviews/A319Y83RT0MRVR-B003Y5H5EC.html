<meta name="summary" content="Controversial - Yes, Great Film - Yes, Ellen Paige is Marvelous - Check"></head><body><p>Hard Candy is spectacular. I had no idea what it was about but saw the little girl in a red hooded sweatshirt and decided to see it (very educated guess, I know). It turned out that this is a great film, with superb acting. The acting, more so than the incredible story is the strength of this movie. Ellen Page (Mouth to Mouth, I Downloaded a Ghost) plays the protagonist marvelously. Patrick Wilson (Running with Scissors, Angels in America)'s anguish and creepiness are in tune with where they need to be throughout the entire movie. Any further review will be a spoiler for the plot and this movie deserves to be seen without preamble. It deals with a hard topic in a harsh way but true to its title, it also contains sweetness too - the acting by the cast, particularly the two main characters (there are only five actors in the entire movie).</p></body></html>

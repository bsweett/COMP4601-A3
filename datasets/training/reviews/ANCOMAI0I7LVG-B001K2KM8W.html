I've wanted to for a while now but haven't had the opportunity.  The other night I found the opportunity and took advantage of it; thankfully.  Now that I have finally seen this film (often rendered a masterpiece) I feel slightly more complete now.  No, `El Laberinto del Fauno' is not the most amazing film to have ever been released, but it does deserve a lot of the praise it has received for it is truly an astonishing work of art that is honest, personal and rich with humanity.<br /><br />I'm going to go ahead and yell SPOILERS right now so that no one can yell at me later for ruining the movie for them.  I often try to stay away from any plot points that `give away too much' but for me to commit to writing a review about this amazing film without touching upon the fundamental reasoning for my five stars would be a waste of time for me.  So; if you have seen this movie then by all means continue reading but if you have not consider yourself warned, for I am going to discuss the ending.<br /><br />The film follows a young girl named Ofelia.  Her mother is heavy with child and recently married to an army captain in Spain, circa 1944.  Ofelia possesses a quiet maturity that doesn't always serve her best interest, especially when relating to her new step-father Vidal.  Vidal is cruel and indifferent and repels Ofelia to the point where she finds herself immersed in a world not unlike the one she lives in yet with a magical new meaning.  Approached by the illusive Faun, Ofelia is given an opportunity to live forever if she completes three tasks, tasks that prove to be more tempting and dangerous than she expected.  The events taking place within Ofelia's new world (the labyrinth) parallel those taking place in the real world as her family life comes crashing to a turbulent end.<br /><br />With all its talk of immortality I found that the films primary focus was that of death.  When all is said and done Ofelia receives her reward in her own demise, finally leaving the violent world that has enslaved her to fear and being whisked away to a world anew (inside the afterlife) with her mother and father.  This to me is what makes the film so brilliant, for it wasn't until the films end where the pieces came together and the elaborate story became so much richer and rewarding.<br /><br />My only complaint about the film is that the dark and mysterious world of Pan's Labyrinth is no where near as engrossing as the real world in which Ofelia lives.  I really wanted del Toro's visionary world to be more intriguing but I found my interest fully invested in the real world surrounding Ofelia's fantasy.  That is really my only complaint, and it is a small one at that, for the film is never boring or uninteresting, I just expected my interest to be invested in another facet of the film.<br /><br />The acting is superb on all fronts, especially with regard to Ivana Baquero who delivers what may be the most richly fulfilling child performance in recent memory.  She captures the unbridled curiosity of a child while balancing her characters unfathomable maturity.  She delivers a splendid performance filled with honest emotion and believable innocence.  Sergi Lopez is flawlessly ruthless as Captain Vidal, a performance that is memorable in its brutality.  Maribel Verdu is also memorable, and I don't normally like her (at least I haven't taken to her as others have).  Doug Jones also deserves some recognition for his dynamic undertaking as both the Faun and the Pale Man.  He truly gets under the skin of these two creatures, bringing the brilliant costume and makeup work to life before our very eyes.  Ariadna Gil is effective as Ofelia's mother, but the other performances overshadow her for the most part.<br /><br />In the end I must say that `El Laberinto del Fauno' moved me.  It managed to reach into the pit of me and draw out raw emotion and contemplation I feel more complete now that I've released.  There is beauty within the tragedy of this story, a beauty that helps answer the questions we often ponder about life, death and the here-in-between.</p></body></html>

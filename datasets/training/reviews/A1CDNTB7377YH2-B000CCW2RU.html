<meta name="summary" content="The Best Summer Movie So Far!"></head><body><p>I have seen Star Wars III, Batman Begins, War of the Worlds, and The Fantastic Four.  While all those movies were excellent, The Island outshines them all.  Scarlett Johansen and Euwene MacGregor are excellent as clones who have lived in an enclosed city with the promise of an ultimate trip to "The Island."  This is supposed to be the ultimate reward for their service and those that get chosen to go, do so via a lottery.<br /><br />MacGregor starts to get haunted by a dream where he is on a boat and being drowned.  He tells this dream to the city doctor who appears to be more than intrigued by it, in fact he has a mechanical table violently take hold of MacGregor and inject robot mini probes into the sides of his eyes.<br /><br />MacGregor's curiousity makes him start to question everything and it is sparked more by a maintenance man (Steve Busemi) who lives outside the enclosed city.  (The people are told that the outside was contaminated from a great castrophe).  This curiousity continues to increase when he finds a rather large insect.  MacGregor starts to learn the real truth behind the "lottery" and save his lady friend (Johansen) who has won the lottery and is scheduled to go to the supposed island.<br /><br />The rest of the movie plays out like a super high tech version of Logan's Run.  The special effects are amazing especially the futurastic Los Angeles.  Even though you can kind of figure what will happen, the movie is compelling mostly due to the excellent acting of the two stars.</p></body></html>

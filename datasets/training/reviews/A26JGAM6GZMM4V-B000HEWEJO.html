<meta name="summary" content="Obviously, it is also a wonderful film"></head><body><p>It was produced and directed by Frank Capra who collaborated with Frances Goodrich, Albert Hackett, and Jo Swerling on the screenplay. Nominated for five Academy Awards (including Best Picture) it won none. Over the years, however, it developed a loyal following, largely comprised of those who appreciate Capra's films. Only in recent years has it received the recognition and praise it deserves. How to describe this film? It focuses on a thoroughly decent man named George Bailey (James Stewart) who, after being financially ruined by his evil rival Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), becomes despondent and attempts to commit suicide on Christmas Eve. George is rescued by his guardian angel, Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers), and permitted to learn what would have happened if he (George) had never been born. Only then does George fully appreciate how precious life is. Of course, the film has a happy ending. <p>Many people think this is a corny film but I do not. As in other films (notably in Meet John Doe), Capra celebrates certain basic values which guided and informed George throughout much of his life. When facing financial disaster which involves not only him and his family but countless others who entrusted to him their limited funds...and their own dreams for a wonderful life, George temporarily loses his faith in those values and his will to live without them. He regains his appreciation of life only after a near-death experience and a realization of how important his life had been to others. I am reminded of the situation in Thornton Wilder's Our Town when Emily Webb fully appreciates only in death what she had not previously while alive in a town very much like Bedford Falls..<p>It is noteworthy that Leo McCarey, a contemporary of Capra's, affirms many of the same values in films he directed such as Going My Way and The Bells of St. Mary's. When It's a Wonderful Life appeared in 1946, the World War II had only recently ended. Moreover, only 17 had years had passed since the stock market crash. Several contemporary accounts of American society during the mid-1940s note an excitement about opportunities which had been denied by the Great Depression and then delayed by the recent war. An entrepreneur, George Bailey's dream is to enable as many people as possible in Bedford Falls to own their own home. The film traces his efforts to make that dream a reality while he also marries Mary Hatch and they start a family. Yes, George is idealistic and somewhat naive but has business acumen. Regrettably, he is vulnerable to....<p>I am among those who cherish this movie and the values which it affirms. I am especially grateful for the documentaries, &quot;The Making of It's a Wonderful Life&quot; and the special tribute to Frank Capra, &quot;A Personal Remembrance&quot; from &quot;Frank Capra Jr.,&quot; which accompany it in its DVD format. Until recent years, seeing it again was among the highlights of my holiday season. What happened? By way of concluding this brief commentary, I presume to suggest that those who allowed this film to be overexposed on television every December should be strapped into their seats in a screening room, eyes held open with duct tape, and required to watch the following films (repeated over and over again) for 168 consecutive hours: Battlefield Earth, Barb Wire, Howard the Duck, It's Pat, Little Nicky, and Wild Wild West. I further suggest they be joined by those who have butchered directors' cuts such as Sergio Leone's of Once Upon a Time in America.</p></body></html>

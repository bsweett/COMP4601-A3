And I have always been a fan of Edward Norton. However it was just until recently that I managed to catch this movie, and I was blown away. I was expecting something good, but no way as shocking and powerful as this.<br /><br />Derek was charged with murdering 2 black guys, who were trying to steal his car. He is currently doing time in prison and we are given glimpses of his life before entering prison. He is an influential member of the skinheads. They are a racist group and believe that whites have the sole rights to flourish in the U.S. We are also shown some of the hate crimes committed by Derek and his gang as well as life in prison. These are all in short cuts until they show Derek out of prison and how he sees things differently from then on.<br /><br />First of all, I have to say bravo to the writers and the film makers for making such a bold movie. Whatever movie that deals with racism pales in comparison to this. Derek is not a mindless fool following the crowd. He has his views, his opinions about various problems the country is facing, and scary as this may sound...some of them actually makes sense. That is how profound the dialogue is. One scene in particular showcases this, a scene where the family is having dinner. Derek's mother has a friend over, Murray and they don't share his believes. They are shocked to find Derek has such hatred toward the minorities. Derek delivers some of the best lines in this scene, that you are left wondering...have you ever shared his views? If you did, does that make you a bad person? Is is true what Derek is saying, and if it is...is it fair? These are some of the questions I was left with, watching this movie.<br /><br />As good as the script is, this movie would be nothing without Edward Norton's electrifying performance. Sure, the supporting cast did a fantastic job as well, especially Edward Furlong who played Derek's brother, Danny in the movie. But this movie is undeniably Norton's. I believe that the late 90's was the pinnacle of Norton's success. He gave a superb performance in Primal Fear in 1996, followed by this in 1998 and ending the millennium with outstanding acting in Fight Club in 1999. Here, the character he plays is larger than life. He has the power to change people's perception on crimes and racial views. Putting on 30 pounds of muscle for this role, he has never looked bigger and badder than this. Every move he makes seem to accentuate hate. He feels disgusted with what his neighbourhood has become and he decides to take matters on his own hand, and do something about it. It's just that his believes have been skewed by his father, and without much self control, he spirals down to committing hate crimes. Derek is a bad-a$$ and Norton captures it perfectly. Yet, after prison...Derek experiences something completely different. He has feelings of regret over his past life. He has repent, yet can his sins really be forgiven by him not indulging himself in hate crimes? His brother is headed down the same path and the people who he recruited are now angry with him for leaving that life, they see him as an enemy. How Norton transforms himself to reflect this is really amazing. From a confident, "don't give a f*ck" attitude, he is reduced to a broken man. He feels remorse but at the same time doesn't want to shoulder the responsibility of educating his friends the wrong of his ways. He knows it won't sit well with them. This leads to the movie's final scene which suffice to say, might not really have shocked you but will leave you feeling a mixed of emotions.<br /><br />Good movies entertain, but great movies affect you on a personal level. This is an example of the later. This movie is not for everyone, but for those who are open minded and willing to take the leap, you won't be disappointed. Terrific script and brilliant acting makes this one of my favorite movies. Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

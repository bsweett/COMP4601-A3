Now, you can get the special edition of "Memento," which is loaded with tons of cool features and extras.  Not only that, but the movie is also remastered, both in picture and sound.  Is this special edition worth getting?  You betcha!<p>The picture quality is outstanding!  It's hard to believe that this is a low-budget film.  Somebody wrote a review claiming that this wasn't in widescreen.  I don't know what kind of version that person got, but the one I bought is very much widescreen, so don't let that throw you off track.  To have this movie be presented in full screen would be a crime!  I also noticed how much better the sound quality is.  I haven't had a chance to watch it in DTS, but I'm sure the quality is top-notch.<p>Before the special features, a little recap of what the movie is about for those who are new to this movie.  Leonard Shelby has a condition.  He has no short term memory.  Everything fades for him.  If he talks to someone for too long he'll forget who that person is and what they were talking about.  Ten or twenty minutes later he'll have no recollection of what happened earlier on.  The twist: he's looking for the man who raped and murdered his wife.  Now, Leonard is armed to the teeth with important tattoos to help him remember important info, and is also armed with a camera to take pictures of those who he encounters.  He only lives for revenge, wanting to find the identity of a killer he can't possibly ever know for sure.  The second twist is that the movie is told in REVERSE order.  So, be warned; this is not a movie you can just sit down and eat your popcorn and relax.  This is a movie that forces you to think.<p>Now the special features; there's tons of them.  You get to hear director commentary, which is very cool.  On the second disk is where all of the special features lie, but you can't just click on them.  OH NO!  You've got to work to earn them.  Solve brain teasers and puzzles and answer questions very much like a psychological test.  Very cool!  If you're a fan of the movie, you won't mind the work.  Some of the features are a behind the scenes feature, two trailers, pictures, the short story by Nolan's brother, Leonard's journal, and more.  And there are hidden features I have yet to find.  But I did find one that I think will interest you very much.  Know what it is?  Do you?  Yes, there is a way to watch the movie in CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER!!!  It's hidden, so it's not an option you can just select.  It's pretty easy to do.<p>NOTE: IF YOU WANT TO DISCOVER THE FEATURE FOR YOURSELF, DO NOT READ THE NEXT PARAGRAPH!!<p>Here's what you do: 1)make sure the second disk is in. 2)click on the clock image that is below the gun. 3)answer the series of questions anyway you please; when in doubt, go with "C." 4)you'll be asked to put four images in chronological order instead, put them in BACKWARDS order. 5)need help? here's the order: third image, fourth image, first image, and then the second image. 6)movie will begin to play in chronological order. congrats! enjoy!<p>I was very pleased with this special edition of "Memento."  It was like watching it for the very first time.  If you're a big fan of the movie, then get it as soon as you can.  You will not regret it.  I know I didn't.  This special edition surpasses the original in every way.  See it to believe it.</p></body></html>

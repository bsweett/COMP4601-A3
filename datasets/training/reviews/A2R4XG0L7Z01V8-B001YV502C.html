<meta name="summary" content="If this is what the world's going to come to ... Why are we here?"></head><body><p>Amazing how two films about babies that I've seen in the past couple of days (this and Knocked Up) can make me feel so differently about the world. For starters, Knocked Up made me feel depressed about relationships in general. Children of Men ultimately makes me feel like getting on a roof top and shooting all the zombies.<br /><br />Wrong film.<br /><br />Children of Men ultimately makes me feel like getting on a roof top, with a megaphone, and telling everyone to throw away their pill, their condoms, etc. If every woman in the world is going to end up infertile, then lets get procreating now!<br /><br />Hahahahaha.<br /><br />OK, a bit OTT, but what a harrowing film this is to watch. It's all about the world in 2027 (twenty years away) when no child has been born in 18 years, as all women are infertile, and the world's youngest human is murdered. Clive Owen (I know!) is sought out by an ex girlfriend (played by Julianne Moore) to help protect a pregnant girl.<br /><br />It's set in a very dark and depressing England, filled with guns, violence and lots of not very nice things. The film did grip me from beginning to end, purely because of how shocking it is, despite the fact I hate Clive Owen's acting with a passion. It's a infinitely shocking movie, which will leave you depressed, full of no passion for life anymore - yeah, I do let myself get too affected by movies sometimes. Give me a couple of days. The best thing to do after watching this movie, is to get into bed with the person you love and stay there. Hehe.</p></body></html>

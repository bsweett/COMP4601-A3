The movie moves around in many different directions and there isn't a centric plot or theme. Instead it's like little plays woven together to form a work of art. I especially enjoyed Bruce Willis because he gave an exceptional  performance that was both unique and meaningful. John Travolta was also a lot of fun to watch. The man is a true professional and always gives a wonderful performance in movies, but in "Pulp Fiction" he is even more fun to watch because he put so much life and energy into the role that he plays. If you try to follow the story you'll probably get lost, so don't. If you don't take things too seriously and don't mind mindless violence with a little bit of crude language thrown in for good measure than this movie is assuredly for you. This movie deserves to be on blu-ray.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Truly Creepy and Scary in the best horror tradition"></head><body><p>The modern "horror" film has degenerated into genre of "dead teenager" films - where attractive young people run into some "unspeakable evil" person(s) who spends the rest of the film maiming the attractive young people and the "gotcha" movie set in a haunted place and characterized by the sudden appearance of a ghoul (or cat...) punctuated by a sudden chord on the soundtrack.<br /><br />Not that long ago "horror" works (written and on film) used the audience's own imagination to get under your skin.  "1408", based on a Stephen King story, harkens back to that idea - terrifying you with what's on the screen, but even more with what is SUGGESTED on the screen, with you filling in the blanks.<br /><br />John Cusack is great at playing likable guys and here he plays the King surrogate (aren't all of King's stories either about writers or set in Maine? but I digress...) Mike Enslin is a published, but not on the King/Rowling circuit, writer.  He travels between "haunted" places and bookstores, debunking the "haunted" places, but writing about them in his books. (Ten Haunted Houses, Ten Haunted Lighthouses, etc.)<br /><br />He receives a postcard for the Dolphin Hotel in New York with a warning to not go into room 1408.  He goes.<br /><br />There is a nice scene of exposition with Samuel Jackson as the hotel manager who gives a 100 year history of this evil f-ing room, all but begging Enslin not to go there.<br /><br />But you know he will...<br /><br />The next act is almost all up to Cusack, with increasingly eerie and terrifying things happening in the room which he finds out too late has no way out...<br /><br />Deserves to be ranked with Horror's most watchable and creepy films.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Imaginative, Futuristic Murder Mystery"></head><body><p>Directed by Steven Speilburg, this science-fiction murder mystery is an engrossing dark and brooding story.  Tom Cruise plays the lead, John Anderton, the story takes place in 2054 in Washington, DC.  Precrime has eliminated murder cases thanks to three mediums called precognitive thinkers.  The Precogs are kept in a law enforcement "temple" floating in life-sustaining fluids with their brains hooked up to electrodes.  This is so their psychic thoughts can be beamed to police screens and searched for clues on the next murder.<br /><br />John Anderton is a Precrime enforcer, whose young son was abducted and never seen again.  This tragedy ruined a marriage and caused him to use some kind of neuro drug he buys on the streets.  John is dedicated to arrest and jail would-be murderers before they kill.  Soon, a young and ambitious federal agent (Collin Farrell) shows up on the scene.  The director of Precrime (Max von Sydow) wants to make the program national, and feels threatened.  During this visit to find a flaw in the system, Anderton finds himself accused of a future murder of a man he does not know.  He no longer thinks Precrime is fail-proof.  The Precrime police chase him as they realize he will commit a murder.<br /><br />The movie is an exciting murder mystery, with imaginative special effects and a lesson on humanity's trust in hi-tech and big brother tactics.</p></body></html>

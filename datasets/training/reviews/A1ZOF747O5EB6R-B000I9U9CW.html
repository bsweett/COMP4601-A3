<meta name="summary" content="Menacing.  Compelling."></head><body><p>I found this film strangely compelling.  A simple concept and a limited set were still able to deliver a fine result.<br /><br />In essence, Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is a regular user of the same phone booth and his calls and routine have been watched by a compulsive stalker (Keifer Sutherland) whom we never see until the film's end.  His voice alone, however, is menacing.  The stalker has a gun pointed at Shepard from a nearby window and prevents him form hanging up for fear of being shot.  The plot and the very life of Shepard blacken with time until a gripping denouement is reached.  The stalker is there but cannot be seen.  His influence is powerful.<br /><br />There are many, myself included, who would doubt that a film based largely in a phone booth could ever work.  To my surprise, it did.  The clever use of split screens and the lurking presence of the sniper ensure that one is kept on the edge of one's seat.  Hats off to both Farrell and Sutherland for making the concept work.

<meta name="summary" content="Revolutionary Road Movie Review from The Massie Twins"></head><body><p>If you ever think life can't get any worse, leave it to the movies to introduce you to characters whose despondent situations far surpass your own. Such characters thrive in Revolutionary Road, a film whose outlook reaches so far into a realm of stifling depression that the result is exhaustion. If only we could care for these people in some way, if only we could sympathize or connect, then their suffering might not have been wasted on uncaring eyes. If only.<br /><br />For April (Kate Winslet) and Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) it's love at first sight, and shortly after the seemingly inescapable rut of repetition. Frank assumes the dreary day job as a businessman sleepwalking through mindless work days, womanizing the new secretaries, and purposely slacking in his duties. April is the stay-at-home mother, trapped by her responsibilities and the sinking feeling that her life isn't being lived to the fullest. As the couple plots a course to a new life in the utopian Paris, harsh realities replace desperate dreams and difficult choices steadily destroy their chances at breaking free from the sordid existence they've created.<br /><br />There really isn't anything to like about Revolutionary Road. The characters are all depressing, dysfunctional and annoying - but most of all they're presented in such a way that sympathy is practically out of the question. As April spirals into insanity and Frank broils out of control, the only sensibility comes from the clinically loony John (Michael Shannon) who is so obnoxious that even his explanation of their situation is troubling. The two children, who might also be used to muster sympathy, are frequently away, further disconnecting audiences from the crumbling leads. It's as if we are supposed to despise everyone in the film, responding with nothing but negativity toward their failures and shortcomings.<br /><br />The dialogue is lacking as well, making Leonardo and Kate look as amateurish as their turns in Titanic. Some may argue that they're accomplished actors in their primes and that their performances are worthy of distinction - but even the climax of the film is laughable, along with nearly every sequence in which they bicker and yell. And their arguing takes up the majority of the runtime, making this incredibly dialogue-heavy melodramatic mess all lemons and no sugar. At several points Revolutionary Road is so ridiculously funereal it's funny. It's a movie that will make audiences reevaluate the worst performances and films of the year. Maybe it will also cheer up those viewers who can give thanks that their lives are not this socially impaired - or hit too close to home for others.<br /><br />- The Massie Twins</p></body></html>

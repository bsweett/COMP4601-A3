Kerri Russell will probably forever be tagged as TV's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006J28DM">Felicity - Senior Year Collection (The Complete Fourth Season)</a>.  As Jenna, she turns in a comic & varied performance that bounces between joy & despair, submissiveness & assertiveness.  Under director Adreienne Shelly's deft touch, the film handles the subject of domestic abuse with sensitivity and caring.<br /><br />Jeremy Sisto who will probably be remembered for his appearances on TV's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007R4SWM">Six Feet Under - The Complete Third Season</a> plays Jenna's controlling husband Earl.  I kept flashing on the Dixie Chicks' song, but it was never used in the film that has a great musical selections.  Sisto plays the role as a bruiser, but also with levels of dependency and desperation.  His selfish nature only buys into Jenna's pregnancy when she promises not to love the baby more than she loves him.  As she promises, the irony is that she does not love him at all and lives in complete fear.  Each time he grabs the money she makes from her, pulls up and demands that she meet his needs, as an audience we cringe.<br /><br />As I watched the movie, I did not know that the waitress Dawn was also the film's director or that she was murdered before the film's release.  These real-life events give the film a haunting feel.  Shelly's performance is affecting as the girl who wants love so badly that she sets up five-minute dates so she won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Nathan Fillion who was in "Slither" and six episodes of the TV series "Drive" this year plays Dr. Pomatter who finds himself irresistibly attracted to Jenna.  The sparks that fly between the two put a smile on our face, despite the fact that we are watching two married people carry on an affair.  Again, Shelly's touch is magical as a subject that should not be funny or romantic is given such a human face that we find ourselves drawn into their world.<br /><br />Cheryl Hines from the film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CRR32O">Cake</a> & TV's "Curb Your Enthusiasm" plays the third waitress, Becky.  She has one of those amazing smiles and embraces the character lovingly.  The theme of an affair is repeated again as we find that Becky cares for a disabled spouse and finds a little secret joy.<br /><br />North Carolina favorite Andy Griffith plays Old Joe who owns the pie shop.  His banter with Jenna shows a crusty old geezer who observantly dispenses advice.  It is an excellent cameo that could provide a sentimental dark horse Oscar nomination.  Lew Temple who was in "Domino" plays the diner manager Cal who badgers the waitresses every time they head to the bathroom to discuss matters.  Shelly gives him some touching levels as we see the scene where he dispenses his philosophy of life to Jenna.  Eddie Jemison who has been in all the Ocean's films (11, 12 & 13) almost steals the show as the oddball romancer Ogie whose on-the-spot poetry is hysterically touching and awful at the same time.  Shelly's screenplay reveals so many levels for each of the characters that we feel like we have been dropped into their real-world universe.  This excellent small-budget film deserves great rewards at the box office.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

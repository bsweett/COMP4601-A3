<meta name="summary" content="Defining a genre at its start"></head><body><p>When you look at this movie with the 20/20 benefit of 80 or so years of hindsight, you see that Disney and his people were actually setting up the parameters for a whole new kind of film, and establishing certain givens that would endure through most of their classic animated features: a beautiful young heroine (who isn't *entirely* helpless), animals both friendly and sinister, thrills, scary bits, humor, magic, music, and romance.  They also expand upon the original (in this case a story from Grimms' fairy tales) to make the story more compehensible and the characters people we can better relate to.  Snow White (voiced by Adriana Caselotti, the 21-year-old daughter of an operatic family) is a young princess forced by her vain stepmother the Queen (Lucille La Verne) to dress in rags and work as a scullery maid (presumably her father is dead, though we're never definitely told, and the Queen simply seized the throne as Regent and hung onto it).  When the Queen's Magic Mirror informs her that Snow White can now be reckoned "fairest of them all," she plots to have the girl murdered, but her huntsman (Stuart Buchanan) can't go through with the deed and urges her to run away and hide in the forest.  With the help of the small animals she befriends, she finds the house of the Seven Dwarfs, wins their hearts, and is then found and pursued by the Queen in the guise of a "harmless old beggar woman," with poison apple at hand.<br /><br />In today's liberated climate, some viewers may censure Snow for her panicked flight into the deep woods, but it's worth asking yourself if *you* wouldn't panic too if someone had just come after you with a Bowie knife!  And although Snow dreams of the day "my prince will come" and take her away, she's still a hard, uncomplaining worker who cheerfully resigns herself to the Queen's tyrannies and makes the most of her situation--which, of course, enables her to make a place for herself in the Dwarves' home.  But the best parts of the movie aren't even about her: they focus on things like the friendly animals (watch for the raccoons helping to do the Dwarves' laundry, or the buck who helps pull an ore-cart at their diamond mine), the magic, and the music (anyone who doesn't want to get up and dance during the Dwarves' Yodel Song is seriously in need of an attitude adjustment!).  And, of course, the Dwarves themselves, each a distinct individual (I suspect that a great many of us like Grumpy the best!).  This is a DVD that no family library should lack.</p></body></html>

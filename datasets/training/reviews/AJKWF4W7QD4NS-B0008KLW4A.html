<meta name="summary" content="One of the worst comic adaptations ever made"></head><body><p>This film version based on one of Batman's most revered supporting characters bears little resemblance to the slinky, smart, and sophisticated character that comic fans have read for years, and that's not even half of it.  Even when Catwoman was in pre-production, it was a forgone conclusion that this would be an absolute bomb.  Directed by french director Pitof, the film has no real visual flair besides the very sexy Halle Berry strutting around with hardly any clothes on, and there are quite a number of plain old bad CGI shots.  Sharon Stone gives her most wooden performance in her career, and other cast members Benjamin Bratt and Frances Conroy are wasted.  Not to mention, this movie has no original idea anywhere in it.  The tagline of the film trailers proclaimed, "a cat can bring a soul back to the world of the living to make the wrong things right".  Gee, anyone else remember the Crow?  If you're a fan of Berry, this is worth watching to see her gorgeous body in action, but if you are going to watch this strictly for that, your best bet is to fast forward through the rest of the film.  Other than that, this isn't even worth seeing, and is undoubtadly one of the worst comic to film adaptations of all time.</p></body></html>

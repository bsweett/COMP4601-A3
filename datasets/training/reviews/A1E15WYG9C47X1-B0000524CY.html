<meta name="summary" content="The Devil Inside"></head><body><p>The Exorcist was the first DVD I ever bought, and I was transfixed and became a collector for two reasons,<br />The crisp image of the new digital technology enhanced the picture and sound and with it the quality of watching the film and enjoying it much more as a result,<br />and secondly, having not watched the Exorcist for a long time,  being banned in the UK until recently, I was again totally captivated by this original horror film that has aged very well.<br />Why is it still considered one the the sacriest films  of all time??<br />simple<br />1-Friedkin is a very talented director, and was at the  prime of his art when he did the Exorcist<br />2-The subject matter, dealing with the devil. It was one the the first films to tackle the supernatural in such a style, as opposed to vampires, draculas, zombies and giant tarantulas that was the staple diet of the horror genre.<br />Most crucially, using the innocence of a young girl, (played so well by Linda Blair, her first role and most important to date), as a platform for evil.<br />Though the gory scenes are outdated, and personally I find them the weakest part of the film, they do show this conflict between innocence and evil in one person.<br />The vile language and overt sexual overtones spoken by the devil through the child was the reason the film was banned in UK.<br />3-The music is an integral part of the mood of the film, and using Mike Oldfield's 'The Sentinel', added a lot to the scary atmosphere.<br />There are many disturbing scenes in the film,<br />the gradual possesion of Regan,Father Damien's spiritual conflict,and his dream scene!!!!! very disturbing!!<br />and the acting is all excellent, esp. Ellen Burstyn, Max Von Sydow, and the sadly recently  departed, the late Jason Miller.<br />The DVD has very good extras, and  though I have yet to watch the new version of the film, I still enjoy the Exorcist everytime I watch it, and am scared not by the gore..but by what's behind it all..The Devil Inside.</p></body></html>
